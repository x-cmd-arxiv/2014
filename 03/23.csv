Josephson frequency resonates with the axion mass [C. Beck, PRL 111, 231801

Josephson junction environment allow for a nontrivial solution where the
axion-induced electric current manifests itself as an oscillating supercurrent.
The linear change of phase associated with this nontrivial solution implies the
formal existence of a large magnetic field in a tiny surface area of the weak
link region of the junction which makes incoming axions decay into microwave
photons. We derive a condition for the design of Josephson junction experiments
so that they can act as optimum axion detectors. Four independent recent
experiments are discussed in this context. The observed Shapiro step anomalies
of all four experiments consistently point towards an axion mass of $(110 \pm
2)\mu $eV. This mass value is compatible with the recent BICEP2 results and
implies that Peccei-Quinn symmetry breaking was taking place after inflation.

acquisition of genetic information at unprecedented scales. In order to
determine the genetic blueprint of an organism, sequencing platforms typically
employ so-called shotgun sequencing strategy to oversample the target genome
with a library of relatively short overlapping reads. The order of nucleotides
in the reads is determined by processing the acquired noisy signals generated
by the sequencing instrument. Assembly of a genome from potentially erroneous
short reads is a computationally daunting task even in the scenario where a
reference genome exists. Errors and gaps in the reference, and perfect repeat
regions in the target, further render the assembly challenging and cause
inaccuracies. In this paper, we formulate the reference-guided sequence
assembly problem as the inference of the genome sequence on a bipartite graph
and solve it using a message-passing algorithm. The proposed algorithm can be
interpreted as the well-known classical belief propagation scheme under a
certain prior. Unlike existing state-of-the-art methods, the proposed algorithm
combines the information provided by the reads without needing to know
reliability of the short reads (so-called quality scores). Relation of the
message-passing algorithm to a provably convergent power iteration scheme is
discussed. To evaluate and benchmark the performance of the proposed technique,
we find an analytical expression for the probability of error of a genie-aided
maximum a posteriori (MAP) decision scheme. Results on both simulated and
experimental data demonstrate that the proposed message-passing algorithm
outperforms commonly used state-of-the-art tools, and it nearly achieves the
performance of the aforementioned MAP decision scheme.

loops on infinite graphs. This model was introduced and studied in [LeJ12] and
[LL12]. It is a model with long range correlations with two parameters $\alpha$
and $\kappa$. The non-negative parameter $\alpha$ measures the amount of loops,
and $\kappa$ plays the role of killing on vertices penalizing ($\kappa>0$) or
favoring ($\kappa<0$) appearance of large loops. It was shown in [LL12] that
for any fixed $\kappa$ and large enough $\alpha$, there exists an infinite
cluster in the loop percolation on $\mathbb{Z}^d$. In the present article, we
show a non-trivial phase transition on the integer lattice $\mathbb{Z}^d$
($d\geq 3$) for $\kappa=0$. More precisely, we show that there is no loop
percolation for $\kappa=0$ and $\alpha$ small enough. Interestingly, we observe
a critical like behavior on the whole sub-critical domain of $\alpha$, namely,
for $\kappa=0$ and any sub-critical value of $\alpha$, the probability of
one-arm event decays at most polynomially. For $d\geq 5$, we prove that there
exists a non-trivial threshold for the finiteness of the expected cluster size.
For $\alpha$ below this threshold, we calculate, up to a constant factor, the
decay of the probability of one-arm event, two point function, and the tail
distribution of the cluster size. These rates are comparable with the ones
obtained from a single large loop and only depend on the dimension. For $d=3$
or $4$, we give better lower bounds on the decay of the probability of one-arm
event, which show importance of small loops for long connections. In addition,
we show that the one-arm exponent in dimension $3$ depends on the intensity

has a secret, to distribute this secret among a set of parties such that a
""qualified"" subset of parties can efficiently reconstruct the secret while any
""unqualified"" subset of parties cannot efficiently learn anything about the
secret. The collection of ""qualified"" subsets is defined by a Boolean function.
  It has been a major open problem to understand which (monotone) functions can
be realized by a computational secret-sharing schemes. Yao suggested a method
for secret-sharing for any function that has a polynomial-size monotone circuit
(a class which is strictly smaller than the class of monotone functions in P).
Around 1990 Rudich raised the possibility of obtaining secret-sharing for all
monotone functions in NP: In order to reconstruct the secret a set of parties
must be ""qualified"" and provide a witness attesting to this fact.
  Recently, Garg et al. (STOC 2013) put forward the concept of witness
encryption, where the goal is to encrypt a message relative to a statement ""x
in L"" for a language L in NP such that anyone holding a witness to the
statement can decrypt the message, however, if x is not in L, then it is
computationally hard to decrypt. Garg et al. showed how to construct several
cryptographic primitives from witness encryption and gave a candidate
construction.
  One can show that computational secret-sharing implies witness encryption for
the same language. Our main result is the converse: we give a construction of a
computational secret-sharing scheme for any monotone function in NP assuming
witness encryption for NP and one-way functions. As a consequence we get a
completeness theorem for secret-sharing: computational secret-sharing scheme
for any single monotone NP-complete function implies a computational
secret-sharing scheme for every monotone function in NP.

discretize these problems in space using standard Galerkin-finite element

spatial discretizations with piecewise linear continuous functions on a uniform

properties of the $L^{2}$ projection on the finite element subspaces lead to an
optimal-order $O(h^{2})$ $L^{2}$-error estimate. We also examine temporal
discretizations of the semidiscrete problems by three explicit Runge-Kutta

$L^{2}$-error estimates, which are of optimal order in the temporal variable,

optimal-order $L^{2}$-error estimates for smooth spline spatial discretizations
of the periodic initial-value problem for the systems. We also prove that
small-amplitude, appropriately transformed solutions of the symmetric system

to occur on a single axis and is not chaotic, furthermore no precession effects
could be estimated from our measurements. The comet's spin axis never reached
the plane of the sky from October 2012 to January 2013; during this period it
did not change its direction significantly (less than 30 deg), thus giving us
the opportunity to observe mainly structures such as bow-shaped jets departing
from the single active source located on the comet's nucleus. Only during the

Earth at an angle of about 45 deg from the plane of the sky; this made it

poroelastic material. The coupling of Stokes and Biot equations represents a
prototype problem for these phenomena, which feature multiple facets. On one
hand it shares common traits with fluid-structure interaction. On the other
hand it resembles the Stokes-Darcy coupling. For these reasons, the numerical
simulation of the Stokes-Biot coupled system is a challenging task. The need of
large memory storage and the difficulty to characterize appropriate solvers and
related preconditioners are typical shortcomings of classical discretization
methods applied to this problem. The application of loosely coupled time
advancing schemes mitigates these issues because it allows to solve each
equation of the system independently with respect to the others. In this work
we develop and thoroughly analyze a loosely coupled scheme for Stokes-Biot
equations. The scheme is based on Nitsche's method for enforcing interface
conditions. Once the interface operators corresponding to the interface
conditions have been defined, time lagging allows us to build up a loosely
coupled scheme with good stability properties. The stability of the scheme is
guaranteed provided that appropriate stabilization operators are introduced
into the variational formulation of each subproblem. The error of the resulting
method is also analyzed, showing that splitting the equations pollutes the
optimal approximation properties of the underlying discretization schemes. In
order to restore good approximation properties, while maintaining the
computational efficiency of the loosely coupled approach, we consider the
application of the loosely coupled scheme as a preconditioner for the
monolithic approach. Both theoretical insight and numerical results confirm
that this is a promising way to develop efficient solvers for the problem at
hand.

segmentation) and structural (i.e., how do the segments are mutually related in
3D) information provide valuable priors to a large number of scene and image
manipulation applications. While it is now simple to acquire RGBD images,
annotating them, automatically or manually, remains challenging especially in
cluttered noisy environments. We present SmartAnnotator, an interactive system
to facilitate annotating RGBD images. The system performs the tedious tasks of
grouping pixels, creating potential abstracted cuboids, inferring object
interactions in 3D, and comes up with various hypotheses. The user simply has
to flip through a list of suggestions for segment labels, finalize a selection,
and the system updates the remaining hypotheses. As objects are finalized, the
process speeds up with fewer ambiguities to resolve. Further, as more scenes
are annotated, the system makes better suggestions based on structural and
geometric priors learns from the previous annotation sessions. We test our
system on a large number of database scenes and report significant improvements
over naive low-level annotation tools.

and power transfer (SWIPT). In particular, remote radio heads (RRHs) are
connected to a central processor (CP) via capacity-limited backhaul links to
facilitate CoMP joint transmission. Besides, the CP transfers energy to the
RRHs for more efficient network operation. The considered resource allocation
algorithm design is formulated as a non-convex optimization problem with a
minimum required signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) constraint at
multiple information receivers and a minimum required power transfer constraint
at the energy harvesting receivers. By optimizing the transmit beamforming
vectors at the CP and energy sharing between the CP and the RRHs, we aim at
jointly minimizing the total network transmit power and the maximum capacity
consumption per backhaul link. The resulting non-convex optimization problem is
NP-hard. In light of the intractability of the problem, we reformulate it by
replacing the non-convex objective function with its convex hull, which enables
the derivation of an efficient iterative resource allocation algorithm. In each
iteration, a non-convex optimization problem is solved by semi-definite
programming (SDP) relaxation and the proposed iterative algorithm converges to
a local optimal solution of the original problem. Simulation results illustrate
that our proposed algorithm achieves a close-to-optimal performance and
provides a significant reduction in backhaul capacity consumption compared to
full cooperation. Besides, the considered CoMP network is shown to provide
superior system performance as far as power consumption is concerned compared
to a traditional system with multiple antennas co-located.

their cooperative transmit precoding, so as to minimize the total energy cost

further the comparison with experiment, the non-empirical functionals PBE and

Accordingly, PBE0 and TPSSh are the two most accurate functionals for our test
set, but also these functionals exhibit deviations from experiment by up to 50
kJ/mol for individual reactions. As an important result we found no functional
to be reliable for all reactions. Furthermore, for some of the ligand

experiment BICEP2 of tensor fluctuations in the B-mode power spectrum basically
excludes all plausible axion models where its decay constant is above $10^{13}$
GeV. Moreover, there are strong theoretical, astrophysical, and cosmological
motivations for models involving, in addition to the axion, also axion-like
particles (ALPs), with decay constants in the intermediate scale range, between
$10^9$ GeV and $10^{13}$ GeV. Here, we present a general analysis of models
with an axion and further ALPs and derive bounds on the relative size of the
axion and ALP photon (and electron) coupling. We discuss what we can learn from
measurements of the axion and ALP photon couplings about the fundamental
parameters of the underlying ultraviolet completion of the theory. For the
latter we consider extensions of the Standard Model in which the axion and the
ALP(s) appear as pseudo Nambu-Goldstone bosons from the breaking of global
chiral $U(1)$ (Peccei-Quinn (PQ)) symmetries, occuring accidentally as low
energy remnants from exact discrete symmetries. In such models, the axion and
the further ALP are protected from disastrous explicit symmetry breaking
effects due to Planck-scale suppressed operators. The scenarios considered
exploit heavy right handed neutrinos getting their mass via PQ symmetry
breaking and thus explain the small mass of the active neutrinos via a seesaw
relation between the electroweak and an intermediate PQ symmetry breaking
scale. We show some models that can accommodate simultaneously an axion dark
matter candidate, an ALP explaining the anomalous transparency of the universe
for $\gamma$-rays, and an ALP explaining the recently reported 3.55 keV gamma
line from galaxies and clusters of galaxies, if the respective decay constants
are of intermediate scale.

Lyapunov functions for non-linear non-autonomous differential inclusions
described by ordinary differential equations with parameters. The goal has been
attained through the following ideas and tools. First, three-point Poincare
strategy of the investigation of differential equations and manifolds has been
used. Second, the geometric-topological structure of the non-linear
non-autonomous parametric differential inclusions has been presented and
analyzed in the framework of hierarchical fiber bundles. Third, a special
canonizing transformation of the differential inclusions that allows to present
them in special canonical form, for which certain standard forms of Lyapunov
functions exist, has been found. The conditions establishing the relation
between the local asymptotical stability of two corresponding particular
integral curves of a given differential inclusion in its initial and canonical
forms are ascertained. The global asymptotical stability of the entire free
dynamical systems as some restrictions of a given parametric differential
inclusion and the whole latter one per se has been investigated in terms of the
classificational stability of the typical fiber of the meta-bundle. There have
discussed the prospects of development and modifications of the Lyapunov second
method in the light of the discovery of the new features of Lyapunov functions.

the Tilted-Washboard potential and current of Phase Qubits by precise analysis
of Ginzburg-Landau's free energy equation has been considered. Also we evaluate
the most accurate value of energy levels and wave function in Charge and Flux
Qubits by Semi classical approximation in path integral formalism by
considering limits of experimental errors, comparing them with WKB results and
finally, we try to study more specific the evolution of spectrum of Hamiltonian
in time after addition of interaction Hamiltonian, in order to obtain the high

infinite network of counting processes on a directed graph $\mathbb G$. The
process is constructed as the solution to a system of Poisson driven stochastic
differential equations, for which we prove pathwise existence and uniqueness
under some reasonable conditions.
  We next investigate how to approximate a standard $N$-dimensional Hawkes
process by a simple inhomogeneous Poisson process in the mean-field framework
where each pair of individuals interact in the same way, in the limit $N
\rightarrow \infty$. In the so-called linear case for the interaction, we
further investigate the large time behaviour of the process. We study in
particular the stability of the central limit theorem when exchanging the
limits $N, T\rightarrow \infty$ and exhibit different possible behaviours.
  We finally consider the case $\mathbb G = \mathbb Z^d$ with nearest neighbour
interactions. In the linear case, we prove some (large time) laws of large
numbers and exhibit different behaviours, reminiscent of the infinite setting.
Finally we study the propagation of a {\it single impulsion} started at a given
point of $\zz^d$ at time $0$. We compute the probability of extinction of such
an impulsion and, in some particular cases, we can accurately describe how it
propagates to the whole space.

New Higgs Inflation), where the Higgs boson is kinetically non-minimally
coupled to the Einstein tensor is in perfect compatibility with the latest
Planck and BICEP2 data. Moreover, we show that the tension between the Planck
and BICEP2 data can be relieved within the New Higgs inflation scenario by a
negative running of the spectral index. Regarding the unitarity of the model,
we argue that it is unitary throughout the evolution of the Universe. Weak
couplings in the Higgs-Higgs and Higgs-graviton sectors are provided by a large
background dependent cut-off scale during inflation. In the same regime, the W
and Z gauge bosons acquire a very large mass, thus decouple. On the other hand,
if they are also non-minimally coupled to the Higgs boson, their effective
masses can be enormously reduced. In this case, the W and Z bosons are no
longer decoupled. After inflation, the New Higgs model is well approximated by
a quartic Galileon with a renormalizable potential. We argue that this can
unitarily create the right conditions for inflation to eventually start.

size from mice to elephants, take, on the average, 21s to urinate. We attempt
to gain insights into the physical processes responsible for this uniformity
using simple dimensional analysis. We assume that the biological apparatus for
urination in mammals simply scales with linear size, and consider the scenarios
where the driving force is gravity or elasticity, and where the response is
dominated by inertia or viscosity. We ask how the time required for urination
depends on the length scale, and find that for the time to be independent of
body size, the dominant driving force must be elasticity, and the dominant
response viscosity. Our note demonstrates that dimensional analysis can indeed
readily give insights into complex physical and biological processes.

move further away from the original task and data the \overfeat network was
trained to solve. Astonishingly, we report consistent superior results compared
to the highly tuned state-of-the-art systems in all the visual classification

low memory footprint methods except for sculptures dataset. The results are
achieved using a linear SVM classifier (or $L2$ distance in case of retrieval)
applied to a feature representation of size 4096 extracted from a layer in the
net. The representations are further modified using simple augmentation
techniques e.g. jittering. The results strongly suggest that features obtained
from deep learning with convolutional nets should be the primary candidate in
most visual recognition tasks.

number of steps for verifying arbitrarily large prime numbers. This study
proved that $\pi (n)-Li(n)=o(M(n)\sqrt{Li(n)})$ almost certainly holds without

$Li(n)$ is a logarithmic integral function, and $M(n)$ is an arbitrary function
