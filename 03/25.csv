multivariate normal (Gaussian) distribution. In the one-dimensional case,
computing the probability for a given mean and variance simply requires the
evaluation of the corresponding Gaussian density. In the $n$-dimensional
setting, however, it requires the inversion of an $n \times n$ covariance
matrix, $C$, as well as the evaluation of its determinant, $\det(C)$. In many
cases, such as regression using Gaussian processes, the covariance matrix is of
the form $C = \sigma^2 I + K$, where $K$ is computed using a specified
covariance kernel which depends on the data and additional parameters
(hyperparameters). The matrix $C$ is typically dense, causing standard direct
methods for inversion and determinant evaluation to require $\mathcal O(n^3)$
work. This cost is prohibitive for large-scale modeling. Here, we show that for
the most commonly used covariance functions, the matrix $C$ can be
hierarchically factored into a product of block low-rank updates of the
identity matrix, yielding an $\mathcal O (n\log^2 n) $ algorithm for inversion.
More importantly, we show that this factorization enables the evaluation of the
determinant $\det(C)$, permitting the direct calculation of probabilities in
high dimensions under fairly broad assumptions on the kernel defining $K$. Our
fast algorithm brings many problems in marginalization and the adaptation of
hyperparameters within practical reach using a single CPU core. The combination
of nearly optimal scaling in terms of problem size with high-performance
computing resources will permit the modeling of previously intractable
problems. We illustrate the performance of the scheme on standard covariance
kernels.

harmonics of kink oscillations has tendency towards 3 in the case of prominence
threads. We aim to study the magnetohydrodynamic oscillations of longitudinally
inhomogeneous prominence threads and to shed light on the problem of frequency
ratio. Classical Sturm--Liouville problem is used for the threads with
longitudinally inhomogeneous plasma density. We show that the spatial variation
of total pressure perturbations along the thread is governed by the stationary
Schr\""{o}dinger equation, where the longitudinal inhomogeneity of plasma
density stands for the potential energy. Consequently, the equation has bounded
solutions in terms of Hermite polynomials. Boundary conditions at the thread
surface lead to transcendental dispersion equation with Bessel functions. Thin
flux tube approximation of the dispersion equation shows that the frequency of
kink waves is proportional to the expression \alpha(2n+1), where \alpha is the
density inhomogeneity parameter and n is the longitudinal mode number.
Consequently, the ratio of the frequencies of second and first harmonics tends
to 3 in prominence threads. Numerical solution of the dispersion equation shows
that the ratio only slightly decreases for thicker tubes in the case of smaller
longitudinal inhomogeneity of external density, therefore the thin flux tube
limit is a good approximation for prominence oscillations. However, stronger
longitudinal inhomogeneity of external density may lead to the significant
shift of frequency ratio for wider tubes and therefore the thin tube
approximation may fail. The tendency of frequency ratio of second and first
harmonics towards 3 in prominence threads is explained by the analogy of the
oscillations with quantum harmonic oscillator, where the density inhomogeneity
of the threads plays a role of potential energy.

Furthermore, the distribution of the azimuthal angle difference between the

investigate changes in the architecture of functional connectivity patterns

systems that combine logical models with statistical knowledge. The inference
problem, to determine the probability of query answers in PLP, is intractable
in general, thereby motivating the need for approximate techniques. In this
paper, we present a technique for approximate inference of conditional
probabilities for PLP queries. It is an Adaptive Markov Chain Monte Carlo
(MCMC) technique, where the distribution from which samples are drawn is
modified as the Markov Chain is explored. In particular, the distribution is
progressively modified to increase the likelihood that a generated sample is
consistent with evidence. In our context, each sample is uniquely characterized
by the outcomes of a set of random variables. Inspired by reinforcement
learning, our technique propagates rewards to random variable/outcome pairs
used in a sample based on whether the sample was consistent or not. The
cumulative rewards of each outcome is used to derive a new ""adapted
distribution"" for each random variable. For a sequence of samples, the
distributions are progressively adapted after each sample. For a query with
""Markovian evaluation structure"", we show that the adapted distribution of
samples converges to the query's conditional probability distribution. For
Markovian queries, we present a modified adaptation process that can be used in
adaptive MCMC as well as adaptive independent sampling. We empirically evaluate
the effectiveness of the adaptive sampling methods for queries with and without
Markovian evaluation structure.

has positive characteristic p and G is a p-group. In that case the group action
is ""non-linear"" and the ring of regular functions must be a trace-surjective
G-algebra. Now let K be an arbitrary field of characteristic p>0 and let G be a
finite p-group. In this paper we study the category Ts of all finitely
generated trace-surjective K-G algebras. In a previous paper we have shown that
the objects in Ts are precisely those finitely generated K-G algebras A such
that the extension of A over the invariant ring A^G is a Galois-extension in
the sense of Chase-Harrison-Rosenberg. Although Ts is not an abelian category
it has ""s-projective objects"", which are analogues of projective modules, and
it has (s-projective) categorical generators, which we will describe
explicitly. We will show that s-projective objects and their rings of
invariants are retracts of polynomial rings and therefore regular UFDs. The
category Ts also has ""weakly initial objects"", which are closely related to the
essential dimension of G over K. Our results yield a geometric structure
theorem for free actions of finite p-groups on affine K-varieties. There are
also close connections to open questions on retracts of polynomial rings, to
embedding problems in standard modular Galois-theory of p-groups and,
potentially, to a new constructive approach to homogeneous invariant theory.

to many of such theories, such as a modification of the energy dispersion and
of the canonical commutation relation within the standard framework of quantum

detail the impact of a modified energy-momentum dispersion in a Ramsey-Bord\'e

such an interferometer with nanodiamonds. Thus, taking thermal and
gravitational disturbances into account will show that without specific
prerequisites, quantum gravity modifications may in general be suppressed

White dwarfs can be used to study the structure and evolution of the
Galaxy by analysing their luminosity function and initial mass function. Among
them, the very cool white dwarfs provide the information for the early ages of
each population. Because white dwarfs are intrinsically faint only the nearby
(about 20 pc) sample is reasonably complete. The Gaia space mission will
drastically increase the sample of known white dwarfs through its 5-6 years
survey of the whole sky up to magnitude V = 20-25.
  Aims. We provide a characterisation of Gaia photometry for white dwarfs to
better prepare for the analysis of the scientific output of the mission.
Transformations between some of the most common photometric systems and Gaia
passbands are derived. We also give estimates of the number of white dwarfs of
the different galactic populations that will be observed.
  Methods. Using synthetic spectral energy distributions and the most recent
Gaia transmission curves, we computed colours of three different types of white
dwarfs (pure hydrogen, pure helium, and mixed composition with H/He= 0.1). With
these colours we derived transformations to other common photometric systems
(Johnson-Cousins, Sloan Digital Sky Survey, and 2MASS). We also present numbers
of white dwarfs predicted to be observed by Gaia.
  Results. We provide relationships and colour-colour diagrams among different
photometric systems to allow the prediction and/or study of the Gaia white
dwarf colours. We also include estimates of the number of sources expected in
every galactic population and with a maximum parallax error. Gaia will increase
the sample of known white dwarfs tenfold to about 200 000. Gaia will be able to
observe thousands of very cool white dwarfs for the first time, which will
greatly improve our understanding of these stars and early phases of star
formation in our Galaxy.

Previous analyses suggested that it has heated up from an effective temperature
of about 21kK in 1971 to over 50kK in the 1990s. Canonical post-asymptotic
giant branch evolution suggests a relatively high mass while previous analyses
indicate a low-mass star. Fitting line profiles from static and expanding
non-LTE model atmospheres to the observed UV and optical spectra, taken during
1988-2013, allowed us to study the temporal change of effective temperature,
surface gravity, mass-loss rate, and terminal wind velocity. In addition, we
determined the chemical composition of the atmosphere. We find that the central
star has steadily increased its effective temperature from 38kK in 1988 to a
peak value of 60kK in 2002. During the same time, the star was contracting, as
concluded from an increase in surface gravity from log g = 4.8 to 6.0 and a
drop in luminosity. Simultaneously, the mass-loss rate declined from log
(dM/dt/Msun/yr)=-9.0 to -11.6 and the terminal wind velocity increased from
1800km/s to 2800km/s. Since around 2002, the star stopped heating and has
cooled down again to 55kK by 2006. It has a largely solar surface composition
with the exception of slightly subsolar carbon, phosphorus, and sulfur. By
comparison with stellar-evolution calculations, we confirm that SAO244567 must
be a low-mass star (M < 0.55 Msun). However, the slow evolution of the
respective stellar evolutionary models is in strong contrast to the observed
fast evolution and the young planetary nebula with a kinematical age of only
about 1000 years. We speculate that the star could be a late He-shell flash
object. Alternatively, it could be the outcome of close-binary evolution. Then
SAO244567 would be a low-mass (0.354 Msun) helium prewhite dwarf after the
common-envelope phase, during which the planetary nebula was ejected.

applied in many statistical frameworks including density and regression and
which leads to both robust and optimal (or nearly optimal) estimators. In
density estimation, they asymptotically coincide with the celebrated maximum
likelihood estimators at least when the statistical model is regular enough and
contains the true density to estimate. For very general models of densities,
including non-compact ones, these estimators are robust with respect to the
Hellinger distance and converge at optimal rate (up to a possible logarithmic
factor) in all cases we know. In the regression setting, our approach improves
upon the classical least squares from many aspects. In simple linear regression
for example, it provides an estimation of the coefficients that are both robust
to outliers and simultaneously rate-optimal (or nearly rate-optimal) for large
class of error distributions including Gaussian, Laplace, Cauchy and uniform

analyses of two-dimensional [Ne III] spectra obtained from archival
high-dispersion ($R\approx 33,000$) Very Large Telescope/UVES data suggest that
the emission consists of two velocity components spatially separated by ~ 0.""3,
or a projected distance of ~ 60 AU. The stronger redshifted component is
centered at ~ +21 km/s with a line width of ~ 140 km/s, and the weaker
blueshifted component at ~ -90 km/s with a line width of ~ 190 km/s. The two
components trace velocity centroids of the known microjets and show large line
widths that extend across the systemic velocity, suggesting their potential
origins in wide-angle winds that may eventually collimate into jets. Optical
line ratios indicate that the microjets are hot ($T\lesssim1.6\times10^4$ K)
and ionized ($n_e\gtrsim5.7\times10^4$ cm$^{-3}$). The blueshifted component
has ~ 13% higher temperature and ~ 46% higher electron density than the
redshifted counterpart, forming a system of asymmetric pair of jets. The
detection of the [Ne III]{\lambda}3869 line with the distinct velocity profile
suggests that the emission originates in flows that may have been strongly
ionized by deeply embedded hard X-ray sources, most likely generated by
magnetic processes. The discovery of [Ne III]{\lambda}3869 emission along with
other optical forbidden lines from Sz 102 support the picture of wide-angle
winds surrounding magnetic loops in the close vicinity of the young star.

images of bulk metal is the strong signal dependence on the orientation between

important for NMR and MRI of batteries and other electrochemical devices. Here,
we show results from a systematic study combining RF field calculations with
experimental MRI of $^7$Li metal to visualize skin depth effects directly and
to analyze the RF field orientation effect on MRI of bulk metal. It is shown
that a certain degree of selectivity can be achieved for particular faces of

organizations of group living animals. Behavioural observations on the two

of R. cyathiformis is an aggressive individual who usually holds the top
position in the dominance hierarchy although she does not necessarily show the
maximum number of acts of dominance, while the R. marginata queen rarely shows
aggression and usually does not hold the top position in the dominance
hierarchy of her colony. These differences are reflected in the distribution of
dominance-subordinate interactions among the hierarchically ranked individuals
in both the species. The percentage of dominance interactions decrease
gradually with hierarchical ranks in R. marginata while in R. cyathiformis it
first increases and then decreases. We use an agent-based model to investigate
the underlying mechanism that could give rise to the observed patterns for both
the species. The model assumes, besides some non-interacting individuals, that
the interaction probabilities of the agents depend on their pre-differentiated
winning abilities. Our simulations show that if the queen takes up a strategy
of being involved in a moderate number of dominance interactions, one could get
the pattern similar to R. cyathiformis, while taking up the strategy of very
low interactions by the queen could lead to the pattern of R. marginata. We
infer that both the species follow a common interaction pattern, while the
differences in their social organization are due to the slight changes in queen
as well as worker strategies. These changes in strategies are expected to
accompany the evolution of more complex societies from simpler ones.

variable selection and classification consistency. First, we highlight the fact
that in the $N>p$ setting the canonical vectors can be expressed in a closed
form up to an orthogonal transformation. Secondly, we propose an extension of
this form to the $p\gg N$ setting and achieve feature selection by using a
group penalty. The resulting optimization problem is convex and can be solved
using a block-coordinate descent algorithm. The practical performance of the
method is evaluated through simulation studies as well as real data
applications.

value for tilt of scalar power spectrum $n_S$. The other possibility is to
assume that there is a negative running in the scalar spectral index,
$dn_S/d\ln k\simeq -0.02$ which pushes up the upper bound on $r$ from $0.11$ up
to $0.26$ in the Planck analysis assuming the existence of a tensor spectrum.
Simple slow-roll models fail to provide such large values for $\mathcal{T}_r$

non-Bunch-Davies initial state for perturbations can provide a match between
large field chaotic models (like $m^2\phi^2$) with the latest Planck result
[arXiv:1306.4914] and BICEP2 results by accommodating either the blue tilt of

$\rho_{ABC}$ is an information quantity which lies at the center of many
problems in quantum information theory. Three of its main properties are that
it is non-negative for any tripartite state, that it decreases under local
operations applied to systems $A$ and $B$, and that it obeys the duality
relation $I(A;B|C)=I(A;B|D)$ for a four-party pure state on systems $ABCD$. The
conditional mutual information also underlies the squashed entanglement, an
entanglement measure that satisfies all of the axioms desired for an
entanglement measure. As such, it has been an open question to find R\'enyi
generalizations of the conditional mutual information, that would allow for a
deeper understanding of the original quantity and find applications beyond the
traditional memoryless setting of quantum information theory. The present paper
addresses this question, by defining different $\alpha$-R\'enyi generalizations
$I_{\alpha}(A;B|C)$ of the conditional mutual information, some of which we can
prove converge to the conditional mutual information in the limit
$\alpha\rightarrow1$. Furthermore, we prove that many of these generalizations
satisfy non-negativity, duality, and monotonicity with respect to local
operations on one of the systems $A$ or $B$ (with it being left as an open
question to prove that monotoniticity holds with respect to local operations on
both systems). The quantities defined here should find applications in quantum
information theory and perhaps even in other areas of physics, but we leave
this for future work. We also state a conjecture regarding the monotonicity of
the R\'enyi conditional mutual informations defined here with respect to the
R\'enyi parameter $\alpha$. We prove that this conjecture is true in some
special cases and when $\alpha$ is in a neighborhood of one.

randomly chosen node. While large systems evolving under the majority rule
alone always fall into disordered topological traps composed by frustrated
links, any amount of rewiring is able to drive the network to complete order,
by relinking frustrated links and so releasing the system from traps. However,
depending on the relative rate of the majority rule and the rewiring processes,
the system evolves towards different ordered absorbing configurations: either a
one-component network with all links in the same state or a network fragmented
in two components with opposite states. For low rewiring rates and finite size
networks there is a domain of bistability between fragmented and non-fragmented
final states. Finite size scaling indicates that fragmentation is the only

large coordinate spheres in compact perturbations of
Schwarzschild-anti-deSitter are uniquely isoperimetric. This is relevant in the

  Our results require that the scalar curvature of the metric satisfies
$R_{g}\geq -6$, and we construct an example of a compact perturbation of
Schwarzschild-anti-deSitter without $R_{g}\geq -6$ so that large centered
coordinate spheres are not isoperimetric. The necessity of scalar curvature
bounds is in contrast with the analogous uniqueness result proven by Bray for
compact perturbations of Schwarzschild, where no such scalar curvature
assumption is required.
  This demonstrates that from the point of view of the isoperimetric problem,
mass behaves quite differently in the asymptotically hyperbolic setting
compared to the asymptotically flat setting. In particular, in the
asymptotically hyperbolic setting, there is an additional quantity, the
""renormalized volume,"" which has a strong effect on the large-scale geometry of

matter physics come together. Recent discoveries, enabled by sophisticated
fabrication, have uncovered new phenomena that completely change our
understanding of transport in these devices, especially the role of the spin
and valley degrees of freedom. This review describes the modern understanding
of transport through nanotube devices.
  Unlike conventional semiconductors, electrons in nanotubes have two angular
momentum quantum numbers, arising from spin and from valley freedom. We focus
on the interplay between the two. In single quantum dots defined in short
lengths of nanotube, the energy levels associated with each degree of freedom,
and the spin-orbit coupling between them, are revealed by Coulomb blockade
spectroscopy. In double quantum dots, the combination of quantum numbers
modifies the selection rules of Pauli blockade. This can be exploited to read
out spin and valley qubits, and to measure the decay of these states through
coupling to nuclear spins and phonons. A second unique property of carbon
nanotubes is that the combination of valley freedom and electron-electron
interactions in one dimension strongly modifies their transport behaviour.
Interaction between electrons inside and outside a quantum dot is manifested in
SU(4) Kondo behavior and level renormalization. Interaction within a dot leads
to Wigner molecules and more complex correlated states.
  This review takes an experimental perspective informed by recent advances in
theory. As well as the well-understood overall picture, we also state clearly
open questions for the field. These advances position nanotubes as a leading
system for the study of spin and valley physics in one dimension where

  critical comparison between dynamical and spectroscopic results","MNRAS in press",,"10.1093/mnrasl/slu082",,"astro-ph.GA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  I present a comparison between published dynamical (ATLAS3D) and
spectroscopic (Conroy & van Dokkum) constraints on the stellar initial mass
function (IMF) in early-type galaxies, using the 34 galaxies in common between
the two works. Both studies infer an average IMF mass factor $\alpha$ (the
stellar mass relative to a Kroupa-IMF population of similar age and
metallicity) greater than unity, i.e. both methods favour an IMF which is
heavier than that of the Milky Way, on average over the sample. However, on a
galaxy-by-galaxy basis, there is no correlation between $\alpha$ inferred from
the two approaches. I investigate how the two estimates of $\alpha$ are
correlated systematically with the galaxy velocity dispersion, $\sigma$, and
with the Mg/Fe abundance ratio. The spectroscopic method, based on the
strengths of metal absorption lines, yields a correlation only with metal
abundance ratios: at fixed Mg/Fe, there is no residual correlation with
$\sigma$. The dynamical method, applied to exactly the same galaxy sample,
yields the opposite result: the IMF variation correlates only with dynamics,
with no residual correlation with Mg/Fe after controlling for $\sigma$. Hence
although both methods indicate a heavy IMF on average in ellipticals, they lead
to incompatible results for the systematic trends, when applied to the same set
of galaxies. The sense of the disagreement could suggest that one (or both) of
the methods has not accounted fully for the main confounding factors, i.e.
element abundance ratios or dark matter contributions. Alternatively, the poor
agreement might indicate additional variation in the detailed shape of the IMF,
beyond what can currently be inferred from the spectroscopic features.

compare with recent 2D models produced by other groups who have obtained

for the qualitative disagreement among the groups engaged in CCSN modeling
remains unclear, we speculate that the simplifying ``ray-by-ray' approach
employed by all other groups may be compromising their results. We show that
``ray-by-ray' calculations greatly exaggerate the angular and temporal
variations of the neutrino fluxes, which we argue are better captured by our
multi-dimensional MGFLD approach. On the other hand, our 2D models also make
approximations, making it difficult to draw definitive conclusions concerning
the root of the differences between groups. We discuss some of the diagnostics
often employed in the analyses of CCSN simulations and highlight the intimate
relationship between the various explosion conditions that have been proposed.
Finally, we explore the ingredients that may be missing in current calculations
that may be important in reproducing the properties of the average CCSNe,
should the delayed neutrino-heating mechanism be the correct mechanism of
explosion.

alpha-enhanced, with [alpha/Fe] ~ 0.5. High alpha-element abundances are
typical for metal-poor stars, but in every previously studied galaxy [alpha/Fe]
declines for more metal-rich stars, which is typically interpreted as iron
enrichment from supernova Ia. The absence of this signature in Segue 1
indicates that it was enriched exclusively by massive stars. Other light
element abundance ratios in Segue 1, including carbon-enhancement in the three
most metal-poor stars, closely resemble those of metal-poor halo stars.
Finally, we classify the most metal-rich star as a CH star given its large
overabundances of carbon and s-process elements. The other six stars show
remarkably low neutron-capture element abundances of [Sr/H] < -4.9 and [Ba/H] <
-4.2, which are comparable to the lowest levels ever detected in halo stars.
This suggests minimal neutron-capture enrichment, perhaps limited to a single
r-process or weak s-process synthesizing event. Altogether, the chemical
abundances of Segue 1 indicate no substantial chemical evolution, supporting
the idea that it may be a surviving first galaxy that experienced only one

kernels are the matrix elements of a unitary boost operator in harmonic space.
Algebraic properties of the rotation and boost generators then give simple,
exact recursion relations that allow us to raise or lower the multipole quantum

express kernels of other Doppler weights $d \neq 1$ in terms of the $d = 1$

$E$- and $B$-mode polarization observables do not mix under aberration if and

$\beta$, form the basis of a practical recursive algorithm to accurately
compute any aberration kernel. In addition, we develop a second, fast algorithm
in which aberration kernels are obtained using a set of ordinary differential
equations. This system can also be approximately solved at small scales,
providing simple asymptotic formulae for the aberration kernels. The results of

makes use of the mixing-length scale to express the convective flux, velocity,
and temperature gradients of the convective elements and stellar medium. The
mixing-length scale is taken to be proportional to the local pressure scale
height, and the proportionality factor (the mixing-length parameter) must be
determined by comparing the stellar models to some calibrator, usually the Sun.
No strong arguments exist to suggest that the mixing-length parameter is the
same in all stars and at all evolutionary phases. The aim of this study is to
present a new theory of stellar convection that does not require the mixing
length parameter. We present a self-consistent analytical formulation of
stellar convection that determines the properties of stellar convection as a
function of the physical behaviour of the convective elements themselves and of
the surrounding medium. This new theory is formulated starting from a
conventional solution of the Navier-Stokes/Euler equations, i.e. the Bernoulli
equation for a perfect fluid, but expressed in a non-inertial reference frame
co-moving with the convective elements. In our formalism the motion of stellar
convective cells inside convectively-unstable layers is fully determined by a
new system of equations for convection in a non-local and time-dependent
formalism. We obtain an analytical, non-local, time-dependent sub-sonic
solution for the convective energy transport that does not depend on any free
parameter. The theory is suitable for the outer convective zones of solar type
stars and stars of all mass on the main sequence band. The predictions of the
new theory are compared with those from the standard mixing-length paradigm for
the most accurate calibrator, the Sun, with very satisfactory results.

Strong feedback favours disc formation: (1) because conversion of gas into

arguments, resulting in flat star formation histories and higher gas fractions;
(2) because 50% of the stars form in situ from recycled disc gas with angular
momentum only weakly related to that of the z=0 dark halo; (3) because
late-time gas accretion is typically an order of magnitude stronger and has
higher specific angular momentum, with recycled gas dominating over primordial
infall; (4) because 25-30% of the total accreted gas is ejected entirely before
z~1, removing primarily low angular momentum material which enriches the nearby
inter-galactic medium. Most recycled gas roughly conserves its angular
momentum, but material ejected for long times and to large radii can gain
significant angular momentum before re-accretion. These processes lower galaxy

the strong dependence of the mean free path on the photon energy, the X-ray SED
can have a significant impact on the interferometric signal from the cosmic
dawn. Recent Chandra observations of nearby, star-forming galaxies show that
their SEDs are more complicated than is usually assumed in 21cm studies. In
particular, these galaxies have ubiquitous, sub-keV thermal emission from the
hot interstellar medium (ISM), which generally dominates the soft X-ray
luminosity (with energies < 1 keV, sufficiently low to significantly interact

frequency-integrated transfer equation and the equations of
magnetohydrodynamics when the light-crossing time is only marginally shorter
than dynamical timescales. The transfer equation is solved in the mixed frame,
including velocity dependent source terms accurate to O(v/c). An operator split
approach is used to compute the specific intensity along discrete rays, with
upwind monotonic interpolation used along each ray to update the transport
terms, and implicit methods used to compute the scattering and absorption
source terms. Conservative differencing is used for the transport terms, which
ensures the specific intensity (as well as energy and momentum) are conserved
along each ray to round-off error. The use of implicit methods for the source
terms ensures the method is stable even if the source terms are very stiff. To
couple the solution of the transfer equation to the MHD algorithms in the
Athena code, we perform direct quadrature of the specific intensity over angles
to compute the energy and momentum source terms. We present the results of a
variety of tests of the method, such as calculating the structure of a non-LTE
atmosphere, an advective diffusion test, linear wave convergence tests, and the
well-known shadow test. We use new semi-analytic solutions for radiation
modified shocks to demonstrate the ability of our algorithm to capture the
effects of an anisotropic radiation field accurately. Since the method uses
explicit differencing of the spatial operators, it shows excellent weak scaling
on parallel computers. The method is ideally suited for problems in which
characteristic velocities are non-relativistic, but still within a few percent
or more of the speed of light. The method is an intermediate step towards
algorithms for fully relativistic flows.

gradients for ages younger than 3 Gyrs, while for older ages we found a
shallower slope and an increase in the intrinsic spread. The above findings
rely on homogeneous age, metallicity and distance scales. Finally we found, by
using a large sample of Galactic and Magellanic Cepheids for which are
available accurate iron abundances, that the dependence of the luminosity
amplitude on metallicity is vanishing.

  Several typos are corrected",,,,"physics.class-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The radiative response of the classical electron is commonly described by the
Lorentz-Abraham-Dirac (LAD) equation. Dirac's derivation of this equation is
based on energy and momentum conservation laws and on regularization of the
field singularities and infinite energies of the point charge by subtraction of
certain quantities: ""We ... shall try to get over difficulties associated with
the infinite energy of the process by a process of direct omission or
subtraction of unwanted terms"". To substantiate Dirac's approach and clarify
the mass renormalization, we introduce the point charge as a limit of extended
charges contracting to a point; the fulfillment of conservation laws follows
from the relativistic covariant Lagrangian formulation of the problem. We
derive the relativistic point charge dynamics described by the LAD equation
from the extended charge dynamics in a localization limit by a method which can
be viewed as a refinement of Dirac's approach in the spirit of Ehrenfest
theorem. The model exhibits the mass renormalization as the cancellation of
Coulomb energy with the Poincar\'e cohesive energy. The value of the
renormalized mass is not postulated as an arbitrary constant, but is explicitly
calculated. The analysis demonstrates that the local energy-momentum
conservation laws yield dynamics of a point charge which involves three
constants: mass, charge and radiative response coefficient {\theta}. The value
of {\theta} depends on the composition of the adjacent potential which
generates Poincar\'e forces. The classical value of the radiative response
coefficient is singled out by the global requirement that the adjacent
potential does not affect the radiated energy balance and affects only the
local energy balance involved in the renormalization.

Lyraes, and similarly for the other variable types. The model trained using
only the superclasses shows 99% recall and precision, while the model trained
on all subclasses shows 87% recall and precision. We applied the trained model
to the entire EROS-2 LMC database, which contains about 29 million sources, and

wavenumbers exhibit stronger transient growth and become more balanced, (6)
maximal transient growth (and overreflection) of the wave energy occurs in the
two-dimensional case -- at zero spanwise wavenumber.

synchrotron emission of the interacting galaxies compared to the typical
emission from similar isolated galaxies. This is believed to be associated with
an increase of the star formation rate and the associated turbulent magnetic
fields. The regular magnetic field is usually believed to decrease. We consider
a simple, however rather realistic, mean-field galactic dynamo model where the
effects of small-scale generation are represented by random injections of
magnetic field from star forming regions. We represent an encounter by the
introduction of large-scale streaming velocities and by an increase in
small-scale magnetic field injections. The latter describes the effect of an
increase of the star formation rate caused by the encounter. We demonstrate
that large-scale streaming, with associated deviations in the rotation curve,
can result in an enhancement of the anisotropic turbulent (ordered) magnetic
field strength, mainly along the azimuthal direction, leading to a significant
temporary increase of the total magnetic energy during the encounter; the
representation of an increase in star formation rate has an additional strong
effect. In contrast to expectations, the large-scale (regular) magnetic field
structure is not significantly destroyed by the encounter. It may be somewhat
weakened for a relatively short period, and its direction after the encounter
may be reversed. The encounter causes enhanced total and polarized emission
without increase of the regular magnetic field strength. The increase of
synchrotron emission caused by the large-scale streaming can be comparable to
the effect of the increase of the star formation rate, depending on the choice
of parameters.The effects of the encounter on the total magnetic field energy
last only slightly longer than the duration of the encounter (ca. 1 Gyr).

We consider jointly the uplink and downlink with different processing schemes

reveals how the above parameters affect the EE. Closed-form expressions for the
EE-optimal value of each parameter, when the other two are fixed, are provided
for zero-forcing (ZF) processing in single-cell scenarios. These expressions
prove how the parameters interact. For example, in sharp contrast to common
belief, the transmit power is found to increase (not to decrease) with the
number of antennas. This implies that energy-efficient systems can operate in
high signal-to-noise ratio regimes in which interference-suppressing signal
processing is mandatory. Numerical and analytical results show that the maximal
EE is achieved by a massive MIMO setup wherein hundreds of antennas are
deployed to serve a relatively large number of users using ZF processing. The
numerical results show the same behavior under imperfect channel state

dust and by gas, including absorption by HI, H2, HeI, HeII and CO where
appropriate. We then use this model to investigate the dominant cooling and
heating processes in interstellar gas as it becomes shielded from the UV
radiation. We consider a one-dimensional plane-parallel slab of gas irradiated
by the interstellar radiation field, either at constant density and temperature
or in thermal and pressure equilibrium. The dominant thermal processes tend to
form three distinct regions in the clouds. At low column densities cooling is
dominated by ionised metals such as SiII, FeII, FeIII and CII, which are
balanced by photoheating, primarily from HI. Once the hydrogen-ionising
radiation becomes attenuated by neutral hydrogen, photoelectric dust heating
dominates, while CII becomes dominant for cooling. Finally, dust shielding
triggers the formation of CO and suppresses photoelectric heating. The dominant
coolants in this fully shielded region are H2 and CO. The column density of the
HI-H2 transition predicted by our model is lower at higher density (or at
higher pressure for gas clouds in pressure equilibrium) and at higher
metallicity, in agreement with previous PDR models. We also compare the HI-H2
transition in our model to two prescriptions for molecular hydrogen formation
that have been implemented in hydrodynamic simulations.

estimate the Lorentz force changes for strong fields in large structures over

stratified solar atmosphere is used to demonstrate that in large-scale
structures with typical horizontal magnetic length scale $\gg 300$~km and with
strong magnetic fields ($\ge 1$~kG at the $\tau =1$ opacity layer at 5000~\AA),
the Lorentz force acting on the photosphere may be approximated by a surface
integral based on photospheric boundary data alone. These conditions cover many
of the sunspot fields and major neutral lines that have been studied using
Fisher {\it et al.}'s (2012) expressions over the past few years. The method
gives a reasonable estimate of flare-related Lorentz force changes based on
photospheric magnetogram observations provided that the Lorentz force changes
associated with the flare have a lasting effect on the observed fields, and are
not immediately erased by post-flare equilibration processes.

describe large systems in equilibrium. One part of thermodynamics defines
entropy for equilibrium systems and demands an ever-increasing entropy for
non-equilibrium ones. However, starting with the work of Ludwig Boltzmann in
1872, and continuing to the present day, various models of non-equilibrium
behavior have been put together with the specific aim of generalizing the
concept of entropy to non-equilibrium situations. This kind of entropy has been
termed {\em kinetic entropy} to distinguish it from the thermodynamic variety.
Knowledge of kinetic entropy started from Boltzmann's insight about his
equation for the time dependence of gaseous systems. In this paper, his result
is stated as a definition of kinetic entropy in terms of a local equation for
the entropy density. This definition is then applied to Landau's theory of the
Fermi liquid thereby giving the kinetic entropy within that theory.
  Entropy has been defined and used for a wide variety of situations in which a
condensed matter system has been allowed to relax for a sufficient period so
that the very most rapid fluctuations have been ironed out. One of the broadest
applications of non-equilibrium analysis considers quantum degenerate systems
using Martin-Schwinger Green's functions\cite{MS} as generalized of Wigner
functions, $g^<$ and $g^>$. This paper describes once again these how the
quantum kinetic equations for these functions give locally defined conservation
laws for mass momentum and energy. In local thermodynamic equilibrium, this
kinetic theory enables a reasonable local definition of entropy density.
However, when the system is outside of local equilibrium, this definition
fails. It is speculated that quantum entanglement is the source of this
failure.

the $\lambda \to 0$ limit converges to the slip-free equation, and contact line

with one source-destination pair, three different strategies for using the
available relays are studied, and their impact on the outage probability and
diversity gain is characterized by applying stochastic geometry. By using the
assumptions that the path loss exponent is two and that the relay-destination
distances are much larger than the source-relay distances, closed form
analytical results can be developed to demonstrate that the use of energy
harvesting relays can achieve the same diversity gain as the case with
conventional self-powered relays. For the scenario with multiple sources, the
relays can be viewed as a type of scarce resource, where the sources compete
with each other to get help from the relays. Such a competition is modeled as a
coalition formation game, and two distributed game theoretic algorithms are
developed based on different payoff functions. Simulation results are provided

submarine cable systems is of paramount importance for the correct prediction
of electromagnetic transients in power grids. Recently, we proposed the MoM-SO
method for extracting the series impedance of power cables while accounting for
skin and proximity effect in the conductors. In this paper, we extend the
method to include ground return effects and to handle cables placed inside a
tunnel. Numerical tests show that the proposed method is more accurate than
widely-used analytic formulas, and is much faster than existing proximity-aware
approaches like finite elements. For a three-phase cable system in a tunnel,
the proposed method requires only 0.3 seconds of CPU time per frequency point,
against the 8.3 minutes taken by finite elements, for a speed up beyond 1000 X.

particularly suitable for interpretability since partial covariances describe

problems a new lease of life; one such problem is that of the self-force. A
charged or massive particle moving in a curved background space-time produces a
field that affects its motion, pushing it off its expected geodesic. This
self-field gives rise to a so-called self-force acting on the particle. In
modelling this motion, the self-force approach uses a perturbative expansion in
the mass ratio. One of the most interesting sources of gravitational waves are
extreme mass ratio inspirals - systems perfectly suited to self-force
modelling. One of the key problems within the self-force model is the
divergence of the field at the particle. To resolve this, the field is split
into a singular component and a smooth regular field. This regular-singular
split, introduced by Detweiler and Whiting, is used in most modern self-force
calculations. In this thesis, we derive high-order expansions of the
Detweiler-Whiting singular field, and use these to push the boundaries on
current precision limits of self-force calculations. Within the mode-sum
scheme, we give over 14 previously unknown regularisation parameters, almost
doubling the current regularisation parameter database. We also produce smooth
effective sources to high order, and propose an application of the higher terms
to improve accuracy in the m-mode scheme. Finally, we investigate the status of
the cosmic censorship conjecture and the role that the self-force plays. To
this end, we give regularisation parameters for non-geodesic motion. We also
show the necessity of our results in the exciting area of second order
self-force calculations, which benefit significantly from high-order coordinate
expansions of the singular field. We calculate several parameters that these
schemes require, and highlight the further advancements possible from the
results of this thesis.

methods. In the PM method, the visibility probability for each frequency
component of the image stack, p, is calculated taking into account Barten's
spatiotemporal CSF, the component modulation, and the human psychometric
function. The probability p is considered to be equal to the perceived
amplitude of the frequency component and thus can be used by a traditional

each component is randomly kept with probability p or discarded with 1-p. The
amplitude of the retained components is normalized to unity. The methods were
tested using DBT stacks of an anthropomorphic breast phantom processed in a

Equivalently, this can be formulated by three forbidden patterns, one of which
is the configuration where $e$ is crossed by two independent edges and the
other two where $e$ is crossed by two incident edges in a way that encloses
some endpoint of $e$. A topological drawing is simple if any two edges have at
most one point in common.
  Fan-planar graphs are a new member in the ever-growing list of topological
graphs defined by forbidden intersection patterns, such as planar graphs and
their generalizations, Tur\'an-graphs and Conway's thrackle conjecture. Hence
fan-planar graphs fall into an important field in combinatorial geometry with
applications in various areas of discrete mathematics. As every $1$-planar
graph is fan-planar and every fan-planar graph is $3$-quasiplanar, they also
fit perfectly in a recent series of work on nearly-planar graphs from the area

  In this paper we show that every fan-planar graph on $n$ vertices has at most
$5n-10$ edges, even though a fan-planar drawing may have a quadratic number of
crossings. Our bound, which is tight for every $n \geq 20$, indicates how
nicely fan-planar graphs fit in the row with planar graphs ($3n-6$ edges) and

have been noted in the fully depleted CCDs that are presently used in the Dark
Energy Survey Camera. The first effect is the observation that the point-spread
function increases slightly with the signal level. This is explained by
considering the effect on charge-carrier diffusion due to the reduction in the
magnitude of the channel potential as collected signal charge acts to partially
neutralize the fixed charge in the depleted channel. The resulting reduced
voltage drop across the carrier drift region decreases the vertical electric
field and increases the carrier transit time. The second effect is the
observation of low-level, concentric ring patterns seen in uniformly
illuminated images. This effect is shown to be most likely due to lateral
deflection of charge during the transit of the photogenerated carriers to the
potential wells as a result of lateral electric fields. The lateral fields are
a result of space charge in the fully depleted substrates arising from
resistivity variations inherent to the growth of the high-resistivity silicon
used to fabricate the CCDs.

the fractional luminosity, radial extent, dust temperature and disc mass. We
then plotted the calculated dust luminosity or upper limits against the stellar
properties, e.g. effective temperature, metallicity, age, and identified
correlations between these parameters. A total of eleven debris discs are
identified around the 37 stars in the sample. An incidence of ten cool debris
discs around the Sun-like exoplanet host stars (29 $\pm$ 9 %) is consistent
with the detection rate found by DUNES (20.2 $\pm$ 2.0 %). For the debris disc
systems, the dust temperatures range from 20 to 80 K, and fractional
luminosities ($L_{\rm IR}/L_{\star}$) between 2.4 $\times$10$^{-6}$ and 4.1
$\times$10$^{-4}$. In the case of non-detections, we calculated typical
3-$\sigma$ upper limits to the dust fractional luminosities of a few
$\times10^{-6}$. We recover the previously identified correlation between
stellar metallicity and hot Jupiter planets in our data set. We find a
correlation between the increased presence of dust, lower planet masses and
lower stellar metallicities. (abridged)

of the current last record is defined, we propose three distinct sequences of
ages (indexed by $\alpha$ = I, II, III) associated to a given sequence of

element among this sequence of ages. To characterize the statistics of these
longest lasting records, we compute: (i) the probability that the record of the
longest age is broken at step $n$, denoted by $Q^{\alpha}(n)$, which we call
the probability of record breaking and: (ii) the duration of the longest

independent of the jump distribution $p(\eta)$. We compute exactly the large

applications not only because it is a natural p-type semiconductor but also it
possesses a layer-number dependent direct bandgap (in the range of 0.3 eV~1.5
eV). On basis of the density functional theory calculations, we investigate
electronic properties of the bilayer phosphorene with different stacking
orders. We find that the direct bandgap of the bilayers can vary from 0.78 -
1.04 eV with three different stacking orders. In addition, a vertical electric
field can further reduce the bandgap down to 0.56 eV (at the field strength 0.5

superimposed with the p-type AA- or AB-stacked bilayer phosphorene, the
combined tri-layer can be an effective solar-cell material with type-II
heterojunction alignment. The power conversion efficiency is predicted to be
~18% or 16% with AA- or AB-stacked bilayer phosphorene, higher than reported

moving mesh schemes consist of two semi-discrete equations in which the time is
continuous and the space is discrete. In self-adaptive moving mesh schemes, one
of two equations is an evolution equation of mesh intervals which is deeply
related to a discrete analogue of a reciprocal (hodograph) transformation. An
evolution equations of mesh intervals is a discrete analogue of a conservation
law of an original equation, and a set of mesh intervals corresponds to a
conserved density which play an important role in generation of adaptive moving
mesh. Lax pairs of self-adaptive moving mesh schemes for short pulse type

self-adaptive moving mesh schemes for short pulse type equations. It is also
shown that self-adaptive moving mesh schemes for short pulse type equations
provide good numerical results by using standard time-marching methods such as

of warm CO extending tens of AU inside its 30 AU dust cavity. We used the dust
radiative transfer code MCFOST and the thermochemical code ProDiMo to derive
the disk structure from the simultaneous modeling of the spectral energy
distribution (SED), VLT/CRIRES CO P(10) 4.75 micron, Herschel/PACS [O I] 63
micron, Spitzer-IRS, and JCMT 12CO J=3-2 spectra, VLTI/PIONIER H-band
visibilities, and constraints from (sub-)mm continuum interferometry and
near-IR imaging. We found a disk model able to describe the current
observations simultaneously. This disk has the following structure. (1) To
reproduce the SED, the near-IR interferometry data, and the CO ro-vibrational
emission, refractory grains (we suggest carbon) are present inside the silicate
sublimation radius (0.08<R<0.2 AU). (2) The dust cavity (R<30 AU) is filled
with gas, the surface density of this gas must increase with radius to fit the
CO P(10) line profile, a small gap of a few AU in the gas is compatible with
current data, and a large gap in the gas is not likely. (4) The gas/dust ratio
inside the cavity is > 100 to account for the 870 micron continuum upper limit
and the CO P(10) line flux. (5) The gas/dust ratio at 30<R<200 AU is < 10 to
simultaneously describe the [O I] 63 micron line flux and the CO P(10) line
profile. (6) In the outer disk, most of the mass should be located in the
midplane, and a significant fraction of the dust is in large grains.
Conclusions: Simultaneous modeling of the gas and dust is required to break the
model degeneracies and constrain the disk structure. An increasing gas surface
density with radius in the inner dust cavity echoes the effect of a migrating
Jovian planet. The low gas mass (a few MJupiter) in the HD 135344B's disk
suggests that it is an evolved disk that has already lost a large portion of
its mass.

beta for the temperature dependence of the magnetization below T_C, gamma for
the magnetic susceptibility, and delta for the magnetic isothermal at T_C have
been determined with a modified Arrott plot, a Kouvel-Fisher plot, and the
scaling analysis. Magnetization in the ferromagnetic state has strong uniaxial
magnetic anisotropy in the two compounds. However, the universality class of
the critical phenomena do not belong to the three dimensional (3D) Ising
system. Although the values of beta in UGe2 and URhGe are close to those in the
3D magnets, the values of gamma are close to unity, that expected from the mean
field theory. Similar critical exponents have been reported previously for the
3D Ising ferromagnet UIr where superconductivity appears under high pressure.
The critical behavior may be limited to a very narrow Ginzburg critical region
of 1 mK because of the strong itinerant character of the 5f electrons in the
ferromagnetic superconductor UCoGe where the mean field behavior of the
magnetization has been reported. The unconventional critical scaling of
magnetization in UGe2, URhGe and UIr cannot be explained via previous
approaches to critical phenomena. The ferromagnetic correlation between the 5f

galaxies are fit with rising SFRs, we find that the trend seen in the data
qualitatively matches the expectations from a semi-analytic model of galaxy
formation. The mean specific SFR is shown to increase with redshift, also in
agreement with the theoretical prediction. From the derived tight correlation
between stellar masses and SFRs, we derive the mean SFH of star-forming
galaxies in the redshift range of 3 <~ z <~ 5, which shows a steep power-law
(with power alpha = 5.85) increase with time. We also investigate the formation
timescales and the mean stellar population ages of these star-forming galaxies.
Our analysis reveals that UV-selected star-forming galaxies have a broad range
of the formation redshift. The derived stellar masses and the stellar
population ages show positive correlation in a sense that more massive galaxies
are on average older, but with significant scatter. This large scatter implies
that the galaxies' mass is not the only factor which affects the growth or star

significantly reduce the bandgap of a-PNRs, leading to the
semiconductor-to-metal transition beyond certain electric field. For
single-walled phosphorene nanotubes (SW-PNTs), both armchair and zigzag

the bandgap modulation is more significant with more layers. Lastly,

Recently, the way to perform secure compressive sensing (SCS) has become a
topic of growing interest. The existing works on SCS usually take the sensing
matrix as a key and the resultant security level is not evaluated in depth.
They can only be considered as a preliminary exploration on SCS, but a concrete
and operable encipher model is not given yet. In this paper, we are going to
investigate SCS in a systematic way. The relationship between CS and
symmetric-key cipher indicates some possible encryption models. To this end, we
propose the two-level protection models (TLPM) for SCS which are developed from
measurements taking and something else, respectively. It is believed that these
models will provide a new point of view and stimulate further research in both
CS and cryptography. Specifically, an efficient and secure encryption scheme
for parallel compressive sensing (PCS) is designed by embedding a two-layer
protection in PCS using chaos. The first layer is undertaken by random
permutation on a two-dimensional signal, which is proved to be an acceptable
permutation with overwhelming probability. The other layer is to sample the
permuted signal column by column with the same chaotic measurement matrix,
which satisfies the restricted isometry property of PCS with overwhelming
probability. Both the random permutation and the measurement matrix are
constructed under the control of a chaotic system. Simulation results show that
unlike the general joint compression and encryption schemes in which encryption
always leads to the same or a lower compression ratio, the proposed approach of
embedding encryption in PCS actually improves the compression performance.
Besides, the proposed approach possesses high transmission robustness against
additive Gaussian white noise and cropping attack.

through which all multipole moments can be specified in terms of just their

no-hair-like relations among multipole moments for neutron stars and quark
stars that are independent of their equation of state. We calculate the
multipole moments of these stars up to hexadecapole order by constructing
uniformly-rotating and unmagnetized stellar solutions to the Einstein
equations. For slowly-rotating stars, we construct stellar solutions to quartic
order in spin in a slow-rotation expansion, while for rapidly-rotating stars,
we solve the Einstein equations numerically with the LORENE and RNS codes. We
find that the multipole moments extracted from these numerical solutions are
consistent with each other. We confirm that the current-dipole is related to
the mass-quadrupole in an approximately equation of state independent fashion,
which does not break for rapidly rotating neutron stars or quark stars. We
further find that the current-octupole and the mass-hexadecapole moments are
related to the mass-quadrupole in an approximately equation of state
independent way to $\sim 10%$, worsening in the hexadecapole case. All of our
findings are in good agreement with previous work that considered stellar
solutions to leading-order in a weak-field expansion. The quartic in spin,
slowly-rotating solutions found here allow us to estimate the systematic errors
in the measurement of the neutron star's mass and radius with future X-ray
observations, such as NICER and LOFT. We find that the effect of these
quartic-in-spin terms on the quadrupole and hexadecapole moments and stellar
eccentricity may dominate the error budget for very rapidly-rotating neutron
stars. The new universal relations found here should help to reduce such
systematic errors.

the metric satisfies weak regularity conditions, so that the metric
coefficients (in suitable coordinates) are only in the Sobolev space H1 or have
even weaker regularity. The authors recently introduced this class of
spacetimes in the broader context of T2 symmetric spacetimes and established
the existence of a global foliation by spacelike hypersurfaces when the time
function is chosen to be the area of the surfaces of symmetry. In the present
paper, we identify the global causal geometry of these spacetimes and, in
particular, establish that weakly regular Gowdy spacetimes are future causally
geodesically complete. This result extends a theorem by Ringstr\""om for metrics
with sufficiently high regularity. We emphasize that our proof of the energy
decay is based on an energy functional inspired by the Gowdy-to-Ernst
transformation. In order to establish the geodesic completeness property, we
prove a higher regularity property concerning the metric coefficients along
timelike curves and we provide a novel analysis of the geodesic equation for
Gowdy spacetimes, which does not require high-order regularity estimates. Even
when sufficient regularity is assumed, our proof provides an alternative and
shorter proof of the energy decay and of the geodesic completeness property for
Gowdy spacetimes.

13C($\alpha$,n)16O in AGB stars, requiring proton injections from the envelope.
These were so far assumed to involve a small mass ($\lesssim 10^{-3}$
M$_{\odot}$), but models with rotation suggest that in such tiny layers
excessive 14N hampers s-processing. Furthermore, s-element abundances in
Galaxies require 13C-rich layers substantially extended in mass ($\gtrsim 4
\times 10^{-3}$ M$_{\odot}$). We therefore present new calculations aiming at
clarifying those issues and at understanding if the solar composition helps to
constrain the 13C ""pocket"" extension. We show: i) that mixing ""from bottom to
top"" (like in magnetic buoyancy or other forced mechanisms) can form a 13C
reservoir substantially larger than assumed so far, covering most of the
He-rich layers; ii) that stellar models at a fixed metallicity, based on this
idea reproduce the main s-component as accurately as before; iii) that they
make nuclear contributions from unknown nucleosynthesis processes (LEPP)
unnecessary, against common assumptions. These models also avoid problems of
mixing at the envelope border and fulfil requirements from C-star luminosities.
They yield a large production of nuclei below A = 100, so that 86,87Sr may be
fully synthesized by AGB stars, while 88Sr, 89Y and 94Zr are contributed more
efficiently than before. We finally suggest tests suitable to say a final word

into some subspace of the parameter space. The robustness of these restricted
minimum divergence estimators are very important in order to have overall
robust inference. In this paper we provide a comprehensive description of the
robustness of such restricted estimators in terms of their Influence Function
for a general class of density based divergences along with their unrestricted
versions. In particular, the robustness of some popular minimum divergence
estimators are also demonstrated under certain usual restrictions. Thus this
paper provides a general framework for the influence function analysis of a
large class of minimum divergence estimators with or without restrictions on
the parameters.

over the years, has created several new algorithmic challenges to be addressed.
Sequential approaches have become unfeasible, while interest on parallel and
distributed algorithms has greatly increased.
  Appropriately partitioning the graph as a preprocessing step can improve the
degree of parallelism of its analysis. A number of heuristic algorithms have
been developed to solve this problem, but many of them subdivide the graph on
its vertex set, thus obtaining a vertex-partitioned graph.
  Aim of this paper is to explore a completely different approach based on edge
partitioning, in which edges, rather than vertices, are partitioned into
disjoint subsets. Contribution of this paper is twofold: first, we introduce a
graph processing framework based on edge partitioning, that is flexible enough
to be applied to several different graph problems. Second, we show the
feasibility of these ideas by presenting a distributed edge partitioning
algorithm called d-fep.
  Our framework is thoroughly evaluated, using both simulations and an Hadoop
implementation running on the Amazon EC2 cloud. The experiments show that d-fep
is efficient, scalable and obtains consistently good partitions. The resulting
edge-partitioned graph can be exploited to obtain more efficient
implementations of graph analysis algorithms.

  In this paper, we propose an iterative {\em tiered move making algorithm}
which is able to handle general pairwise terms. Each move to the next
configuration is based on the current labeling and an optimal tiered move,
where each tiered move requires one application of the dynamic programming
based tiered labeling method introduced in Felzenszwalb et. al.

for any general pairwise potential, and we give a theoretical analysis of the

expect good performance. We first evaluate our method on an object-class
segmentation problem using the Pascal VOC-11 segmentation dataset where we
learn general pairwise terms. Further we evaluate the algorithm on many other
benchmark labeling problems such as stereo, image segmentation, image stitching

Hydrae Association (TWA) which is a young (5-15 Myr) moving group in close
proximity (~50 pc) to the solar system. The aim of this work is to verify this
hypothesis by different means. We first combine diffraction-limited
observations from the ESO NTT 3.5m telescope in SDSS-i' and -z' passbands and
ESO 3.6m telescope in H-band with literature data to obtain a new, amended
orbit fit, estimate the spectral types of both components, and reanalyse the
Hipparcos parallax and proper motion taking the orbital motion into account.
Moreover, we use two high-resolution spectra of HD 102077 obtained with the
fibre-fed optical echelle spectrograph FEROS at the MPG/ESO 2.2m telescope to
determine the radial velocity and the lithium equivalent width of the system.
  The trajectory of HD 102077 is well constrained and we derive a total system
mass of $2.6 \pm 0.8\,$ M$_{\odot}$ and a semi-major axis of $14.9 \pm
1.6\,$AU. From the i'-z' colours we infer an integrated spectral type of K2V,
and individual spectral types of K0 +/- 1 and K5 +/- 1. The radial velocity
corrected for the orbital motion of the system is $17.6 \pm 2\,$km/s. Even
though the parallax determination from the Hipparcos data is not influenced by
the orbital motion, the proper motion changes to $\mu_\alpha*\cos(\delta) =
-137.84 \pm 1.26\,$ mas/yr and $\mu_\delta = -33.53 \pm 1.45 \,$mas/yr. With
the resultant space motion, the probability of HD 102077 being a member of TWA
is less than 1%. Furthermore, the lithium equivalent width of $200 \pm 4\,$m\AA
$\,$ is consistent with an age between 30 Myr and 120 Myr and thus older than
the predicted age of TWA. In conclusion, HD 102077's age, galactic space
motion, and position do not fit TWA or any other young moving group.

control studies on both finite and infinite horizon. (Because of said

resonance through the quadrupole splittings of $^{17}$O and $^{63}$Cu. Based on
new data for single crystals of electron-doped Pr$_{2-x}$Ce$_x$CuO$_4$(x=0,
0.05, 0.10, 0.15) as well as Nd$_{2-x}$Ce$_x$CuO$_4$ (x=0, 0.13) the changes in
hole contents $n_d$ of Cu 3d$(x^2-y^2)$ and $n_p$ of O 2$p_\sigma$ orbitals are
determined and they account for the stoichiometrically doped charges, similar
to hole-doped \lsco. It emerges that while $n_d+2n_p=1$ in all parent materials
as expected, $n_d$ and $n_p$ vary substantially between different groups of
materials. Doping holes increases predominantly $n_p$, but also $n_d$. To the
contrary, doping electrons predominantly decreases $n_d$ and only slightly
$n_p$. However, $n_p$ for the electron doped systems is higher than that in
hole doped La$_{1.85}$Sr$_{0.15}$CuO$_4$. Cuprates with the highest maximum
$T_{\rm c}$s appear to have a comparably low $n_d$ while, at the same time,
$n_p$ is very high. The rather high oxygen hole content of the Pr$_2$CuO$_4$
and Nd$_2$CuO$_4$ with the low $n_d$ seems to make them ideal candidates for
hole doping to obtain the highest $T_{\rm c}$.

basic components in machine learning. However, their relationships have not yet
been fully investigated. In this paper, we find that the spectral graph theory
underlies a series of these elementary methods and can unify them into a
complete framework. The methods include PCA, K-means, Laplacian eigenmap (LE),
ratio cut (Rcut), and a new sparse representation method developed by us,
called spectral sparse representation (SSR). Further, extended relations to
conventional over-complete sparse representations (e.g., method of optimal
directions, KSVD), manifold learning (e.g., kernel PCA, multidimensional
scaling, Isomap, locally linear embedding), and subspace clustering (e.g.,
sparse subspace clustering, low-rank representation) are incorporated. We show
that, under an ideal condition from the spectral graph theory, PCA, K-means,
LE, and Rcut are unified together. And when the condition is relaxed, the
unification evolves to SSR, which lies in the intermediate between PCA/LE and
K-mean/Rcut. An efficient algorithm, NSCrt, is developed to solve the sparse
codes of SSR. SSR combines merits of both sides: its sparse codes reduce
dimensionality of data meanwhile revealing cluster structure. For its inherent
relation to cluster analysis, the codes of SSR can be directly used for
clustering. Scut, a clustering approach derived from SSR reaches the
state-of-the-art performance in the spectral clustering family. The one-shot
solution obtained by Scut is comparable to the optimal result of K-means that
are run many times. Experiments on various data sets demonstrate the properties
and strengths of SSR, NSCrt, and Scut.

spectroscopic data with the FORS and ISAAC instruments on the VLT. We analyse
their infra-red spectra using a full spectrum fitting technique which yields
the kinematics of their stars and ionized gas together with their stellar
population characteristics. We find that the_stellar_ velocity to velocity
dispersion ratio (v/sigma) of our BCDs is of the order of 1.5, similar to that
of dwarf elliptical galaxies. Thus, those objects do not require significant
(if any) loss of angular momentum to fade into early type dwarfs. This finding
is in discordance with previous studies, which however compared the stellar
kinematics of dwarf elliptical galaxies with the gaseous kinematics of star
forming dwarfs. The stellar velocity fields of our objects are very disturbed
and the star-formation regions are often kinematically decoupled from the rest
of the galaxy. These regions can be more or less metal rich with respect to the
galactic body, and sometimes they are long lived. These characteristics prevent
us from pinpointing a unique trigger of the star formation, even within the

oscillating kernels and potentially contain a larger amount of information on

test, we have formulated the complex Borel sum rules for the phi meson channel
and have analyzed them using the maximum entropy method, by which we can
extract the most probable spectral function from the sum rules without strong
assumptions on its functional form. As a result, it is demonstrated that,
compared to earlier studies, the complex valued sum rules allow us to extract
the spectral function with a significantly improved resolution and thus to
study more detailed structures of the hadronic spectrum than previously
possible.

configurable process model should itself evolve to add new variations. In turn,
this requires a comprehensive support for managing the evolution of

filter that aims at estimating the physical terms appearing in the Radio
Interferometry Measurement Equation (RIME). We enrich the filter's structure
with a tunable data representation model, together with an augmented
measurement model for regularization. We show using simulations that it can
properly estimate the physical effects appearing in the RIME. We found that
this approach is particularly useful in the most extreme cases such as when
ionospheric and clock effects are simultaneously present. Combined with the
ability to provide prior knowledge on the expected structure of the physical
instrumental effects (expected physical state and dynamics), we obtain a fairly
cheap algorithm that we believe to be robust, especially in low signal-to-noise
regime. Potentially the use of filters and other similar methods can represent
an improvement for calibration in radio interferometry, under the condition
that the effects corrupting visibilities are understood and analytically
stable. Recursive algorithms are particularly well adapted for pre-calibration
and sky model estimate in a streaming way. This may be useful for the SKA-type

thermal wavelengths we determine radiometric sizes, geometric albedos and
thermal beaming factors as well as study sample properties of dynamically hot

space telescopes are combined with optical magnitudes using the radiometric
technique with near-Earth asteroid thermal model (NEATM). We have determined
three-band flux densities from Herschel/PACS observations at 70.0, 100.0 and
160.0 $\mu$m and Spitzer/MIPS at 23.68 and 71.42 $\mu$m when available. We have
analysed 18 classical TNOs with previously unpublished data and re-analysed
previously published targets with updated data reduction to determine their
sizes and geometric albedos as well as beaming factors when data quality
allows. We have combined these samples with classical TNOs with radiometric
results in the literature for the analysis of sample properties of a total of
44 objects. We find a median geometric albedo for cold classical TNOs of 0.14
and for dynamically hot classical TNOs, excluding the Haumea family and dwarf
planets, 0.085. We have determined the bulk densities of Borasisi-Pabu (2.1
g/cm^3), Varda-Ilmare (1.25 g/cm^3) and 2001 QC298 (1.14 g/cm^3) as well as
updated previous density estimates of four targets. We have determined the
slope parameter of the debiased cumulative size distribution of dynamically hot
classical TNOs as q=2.3 +- 0.1 in the diameter range 100<D<500 km. For
dynamically cold classical TNOs we determine q=5.1 +- 1.1 in the diameter range
160<D<280 km as the cold classical TNOs have a smaller maximum size.

authenticity of the information, mistake the rumor as genuine information and
pass it on to their acquaintances. We propose a solution where a set of

provided resources to help them distinguish a rumor from genuine information.
By formulating an optimization problem we calculate the optimum set of
individuals, who must undergo training, and the quality of training that
minimizes the expected training cost and ensures an upper bound on the size of
the rumor outbreak. Our primary contribution is that although the optimization
problem turns out to be non convex, we show that the problem is equivalent to
solving a set of linear programs. This result also allows us to solve the
problem of minimizing the size of rumor outbreak for a given cost budget. The
optimum solution displays an interesting pattern which can be implemented as a
heuristic. These results can prove to be very useful for social planners and

spacetime $V_4$ into a higher dimensional space $V_N$; then our spacetime is
merely a 4-surface in $V_N$.What remains is conceptually not so difficult: just
to quantise this 4-surface. Our formal procedure generalises our version of
Stueckelberg's proper time method of worldline quantisation. We write the
equations of $V_4$ in the covariant canonical form starting from a model
Lagrangian which contains the classical Einstein gravity as a particular case.
Then we perform quantisation in the Schr\""odinger picture by using the concepts
of a phase functional and wave functional. As a result we obtain the
uncertainty relations which imply that an observer is `aware' either of a
particular spacetime surface and has no information about other spacetime
surfaces (which represent alternative histories); or conversely, he loses
information about a particular $V_4$ whilst he obtains some information about
other spacetimes (and histories). Equivalently, one cannot measure to an
arbitrary precision both the metric on $V_4$ and matter distribution on various
alternative spacetime surfaces. We show how this special case in the
`coordinate' representations can be generalised to an arbitrary vector in an
abstract Hilbert space.

measurements in computed tomography (CT) in order to characterize material
properties as well as object shape. Material characterization is performed by
decomposing the scene into constitutive basis functions, such as Compton
scatter and photoelectric absorption functions. While well motivated
physically, the joint recovery of the spatial distribution of photoelectric and
Compton properties is severely complicated by the fact that the data are
several orders of magnitude more sensitive to Compton scatter coefficients than
to photoelectric absorption, so small errors in Compton estimates can create
large artifacts in the photoelectric estimate. To address these issues, we
propose a model-based iterative approach which uses patch-based regularization
terms to stabilize inversion of photoelectric coefficients, and solve the
resulting problem though use of computationally attractive Alternating
Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) solution techniques. Using simulations
and experimental data acquired on a commercial scanner, we demonstrate that the
proposed processing can lead to more stable material property estimates which

Hamiltonian which describes the essential interactions in the helix at the
level of the base pair and incorporates twisting and bending degrees of
freedom. Helix unwinding and bubble formation patterns are consistently
computed by a path integral method that sums over a large number of molecule
configurations compatible with the model potential. The path ensembles are
determined, as a function of temperature, by minimizing the free energy of the
system. Fluctuational openings appear along the helix to release the stress due
to the bending of the molecule backbone. In agreement with the experimental
findings, base pair disruptions are found with larger probability in the
smallest minicircle of \textit{66-bps} whose bending angle is $\sim 6^{o} $.
For this minicircle, a sizeable untwisting is obtained with the helical repeat
showing a step-like increase at $\tau =\,315K$. The method can be generalized

averaging over many events. In particular, the effective temperatures extracted
from the parton energy density or number density are often quite different than
those extracted from the parton mean $p_{\rm T}$ or mean energy. For these

neutron star (NS) mergers can create highly magnetised, millisecond NSs. Sharp
cut-offs in X-ray afterglow plateaus of some SGRBs hint at the gravitational
collapse of these remnant NSs to black holes. The collapse of such
`supramassive' NSs also describes the blitzar model, a leading candidate for
the progenitors of fast radio bursts (FRBs). The observation of an FRB
associated with an SGRB would provide compelling evidence for the blitzar model
and the binary NS merger scenario of SGRBs, and lead to interesting constraints
on the NS equation of state. We predict the collapse times of supramassive NSs
created in binary NS mergers, finding that such stars collapse $\sim10\,{\rm
s}$ -- $4.4\times10^{4}\,{\rm s}$ (95% confidence) after the merger. This
directly impacts observations targeting NS remnants of binary NS mergers,
providing the optimal window for high time resolution radio and X-ray follow-up
of SGRBs and gravitational wave bursts.

encounters with resources and mates, but at the same time exposes the organism
to dangerous encounters with predators. The movement patterns adopted by
organisms should reflect a balance between these contrasting processes. This
trade-off can be hypothesized as being evident in the behaviour of plankton,
which inhabit a dilute 3D environment with few refuges or orienting landmarks.
We present an analysis of the swimming path geometries based on a volumetric
Monte Carlo sampling approach, which is particularly adept at revealing such
trade-offs by measuring the self-overlap of the trajectories. Application of
this method to experimentally measured trajectories reveals that swimming
patterns in copepods are shaped to efficiently explore volumes at small scales,
while achieving a large overlap at larger scales. Regularities in the observed
trajectories make the transition between these two regimes always sharper than
in randomized trajectories or as predicted by random walk theory. Thus real
trajectories present a stronger separation between exploration for food and
exposure to predators. The specific scale and features of this transition
depend on species, gender, and local environmental conditions, pointing at
adaptation to state and stage dependent evolutionary trade-offs.

  (4) wCOC can be solved in $O(\min\{k,l\}\cdot n^3)$ time on interval graphs,

AdS/CFT correspondence. Magnetic fields, in addition to the electric field
responsible for the pair creation, causes prominent effects on the rate, and is
important also in experiments such as RHIC/LHC heavy ion collisions. In this
paper, through the gravity dual we obtain the full Euler-Heisenberg Lagrangian
of N=2 supersymmetric QCD and study the Schwinger mechanism with not only a
constant electric field but also a constant magnetic field as external fields.
We determine the quark mass and temperature dependence of the Lagrangian. In
sharp contrast with the zero magnetic field case, we find that the imaginary
part, and thus the vacuum decay rate, diverges in the massless zero-temperature
limit. This may be related to a strong instability of the QCD vacuum in strong
magnetic fields. The real part of the Lagrangian serves as a generating
function for non-linear electro-magnetic responses, and is found such that the
Cotton-Mouton effect vanishes. Interestingly, our results of the Schwinger /
Cotton-Mouton effects coincide precisely with those of N=2 supersymmetric QED.

data from the virtual economy of the massive multiplayer online game (MMOG)
Pardus. This data not only contains every player's wealth at every point in
time, but also all actions of every player over a timespan of almost a decade.
We find that wealth distributions in the virtual world are very similar to
those in western countries. In particular we find an approximate exponential
for low wealth and a power-law tail. The Gini index is found to be $g=0.65$,
which is close to the indices of many Western countries. We find that
wealth-increase rates depend on the time when players entered the game. Players
that entered the game early on tend to have remarkably higher wealth-increase
rates than those who joined later. Studying the players' positions within their
social networks, we find that the local position in the trade network is most

network, relatively low nearest-neighbor degree and a low clustering
coefficient. Wealthy players have many mutual friendships and are socially well
respected by others, but spend more time on business than on socializing. We
find that players that are not organized within social groups with at least
three members are significantly poorer on average. We observe that high
`political' status and high wealth go hand in hand. Wealthy players have few
personal enemies, but show animosity towards players that behave as public

Survey Explorer (WISE)/NEOWISE thermal-infrared survey and similar surveys,
fitted with a simple thermal model, can reveal objects likely to be metal rich.
We provide a list of candidate metal-rich NEOs. Our results imply that future
infrared surveys with the appropriate instrumentation could discover many more
metal-rich asteroids, providing valuable data for assessment of the impact

redshift is sensitive to the timing and nature of hydrogen and HeII
reionization, and can be measured from Lyman-alpha forest absorption spectra.
Since the memory of intergalactic gas to heating during reionization gradually
fades, measurements as close as possible to reionization are desirable. In
addition, measuring the IGM temperature at sufficiently high redshifts should
help to isolate the effects of hydrogen reionization since HeII reionization
starts later, at lower redshift. Motivated by this, we model the IGM
temperature at z>5 using semi-numeric models of patchy reionization. We
construct mock Lyman-alpha forest spectra from these models and consider their
observable implications. We find that the small-scale structure in the
Lyman-alpha forest is sensitive to the temperature of the IGM even at redshifts
where the average absorption in the forest is as high as 90%. We forecast the
accuracy at which the z~5 IGM temperature can be measured using existing
samples of high resolution quasar spectra, and find that interesting
constraints are possible. For example, an early reionization model in which
reionization ends at z~10 should be distinguishable -- at high statistical
significance -- from a lower redshift model where reionization completes at
z~6. We discuss improvements to our modeling that may be required to robustly
interpret future measurements.

private capacity. Both reflect different ways of capturing the notion of
reliable communication via a quantum system while leaking almost no information
to an eavesdropper; the difference is that the latter imposes an intrinsically
quantum security criterion whereas the former requires only a weaker, classical
condition. The channels for which this separation is most straightforward to
establish are the complementary channels of classical-quantum (cq-)channels,
and hence a subclass of Hadamard channels. We also prove that certain symmetric
channels (related to photon number splitting) have positive weak locking
capacity in the presence of a vanishingly small pre-shared secret, whereas
their private capacity is zero.
  These findings are powerful illustrations of the difference between two
apparently natural notions of privacy in quantum systems, relevant also to
quantum key distribution (QKD): the older, naive one based on accessible
information, contrasting with the new, composable one embracing the quantum
nature of the eavesdropper's information.
  Assuming an additivity conjecture for constrained minimum output Renyi
entropies, the techniques of the first part demonstrate a single-letter formula
for the weak locking capacity of complements to cq-channels, coinciding with a
general upper bound of Guha et al. for these channels. Furthermore, still
assuming this additivity conjecture, this upper bound is given an operational
interpretation for general channels as the maximum weak locking capacity of the
channel activated by a suitable noiseless channel.

through the Bogoliubov-Valatin transformation, whereupon the particle degrees
of freedom are replaced by quasiparticles. This approach leads to a spontaneous
breaking of the particle-number symmetry and mixing of states with different
particle numbers. In order to restore the particle number, various methods have
been employed, which are based on projection approaches before or after
variation. Approximate variation-after-projection (VAP) schemes, utilizing the
Lipkin method, have mostly been used within the Lipkin-Nogami prescription.
  Purpose: Without recurring to the Lipkin-Nogami prescription, and using
instead states rotated in the gauge space, we derive the Lipkin method of
particle-number restoration up to sixth order and we test the convergence and
accuracy of the obtained expansion.
  Methods: We perform self-consistent calculations using the higher-order
Lipkin method to restore the particle-number symmetry in the framework of
superfluid nuclear energy-density functional theory. We also apply the Lipkin
method to a schematic exactly solvable two-level pairing model.
  Results: Calculations performed in open-shell tin and lead isotopes show that
the Lipkin method converges at fourth order and satisfactorily reproduces the
VAP ground-state energies and energy kernels. Near closed shells, the
higher-order Lipkin method cannot be applied because of a non-analytic kink in
the ground-state energies in function of the particle number.
  Conclusions: In open-shell nuclei, the higher-order Lipkin method provides a
good approximation to the exact VAP energies. The method is computationally
inexpensive, making it particularly suitable, for example, for future
optimizations of the nuclear energy-density functionals and simultaneous
restoration of different symmetries.

spectrum, this correlation kernel has a remarkable scaling limit $K_M(x,y)$
which can be understood as a generalization of the classical Bessel kernel of
Random Matrix Theory. In this paper we investigate the Fredholm determinant of
the operator with the kernel $K_M(x,y)\chi_J(y)$, where $J$ is a disjoint union
of intervals, $J=\cup_j(a_{2j-1},a_{2j})$, and $\chi_J$ is the characteristic
function of the set $J$. This Fredholm determinant is equal to the probability
that $J$ contains no particles of the limiting determinantal point process
defined by $K_M(x,y)$ (the gap probability). We derive Hamiltonian differential
equations associated with the corresponding Fredholm determinant, and relate
them with the monodromy preserving deformation equations of the Jimbo, Miwa,
Mori, Ueno and Sato theory. In the special case $J=(0,s)$ we give a formula for
the gap probability in terms of a solution of a system of non-linear ordinary
differential equations.

Tevatron collider for abort-gap clearing, beam-beam compensation, and halo

currently being implemented in the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider at
Brookhaven National Laboratory. This work is in support of a conceptual design
of hollow electron beam scraper for the Large Hadron Collider. It also applies
to the implementation of nonlinear integrable optics with electron lenses in
the Integrable Optics Test Accelerator at Fermilab. We consider the axial
asymmetries of the electron beam caused by the bends that are used to inject
electrons into the interaction region and to extract them. A distribution of
electron macroparticles is deposited on a discrete grid enclosed in a
conducting pipe. The electrostatic potential and electric fields are calculated
using numerical Poisson solvers. The kicks experienced by the circulating beam
are estimated by integrating the electric fields over straight trajectories.
These kicks are also provided in the form of interpolated analytical symplectic
maps for numerical tracking simulations, which are needed to estimate the
effects of the electron lens imperfections on proton lifetimes, emittance
growth, and dynamic aperture. We outline a general procedure to calculate the
magnitude of the transverse proton kicks, which can then be generalized, if
needed, to include further refinements such as the space-charge evolution of
the electron beam, magnetic fields generated by the electron current, and
longitudinal proton dynamics.

presence of repulsive Coulomb interactions, the charged states are gapped out
and a local moment is formed. We consider the Kane-Mele-Hubbard model on a
ribbon with zigzag edges to construct an impurity model where the spin fluxon
is screened by the helical edge liquid. In the noninteracting model, the
hybridization between fluxon and edge states is dominated by the extent of the

only has nonzero values for even distances between the $\pi$ flux and the edge.
For the interacting system, we use the continuous-time quantum Monte Carlo
method, which we have extended by global susceptibility measurements to
reproduce the characteristic Curie law of the spin fluxon. However, due to the
finite extent of the fluxons, the local moment is formed at rather low
energies. The screening of the spin fluxon leads to deviations from the Curie
law that follow the universal behavior obtained from a data collapse.
Additionally, the Kondo resonance arises in the local spectral function between

stellar angular momentum. Moreover, the observational study of the CoRoT target
HD51452 by Neiner and collaborators demonstrated the potential strong impact of
rotation on the stochastic excitation of gravito-inertial waves in stellar
interiors. Our goal is to explore the action of rotation on the stochastic
excitation of gravity and gravito-inertial waves in stars. The dynamics of
gravito-inertial waves in stellar interiors, both in radiation and in
convection zones, is described with a local non-traditional f-plane model.
Their couplings with convective turbulent flows is studied in this framework.
First, we find that, in the super-inertial regime in which the wave frequency
is over twice the rotation frequency, the evanescence of gravito-inertial waves
in convective regions decreases with decreasing wave frequency. Next, in the
sub-inertial regime, gravito-inertial waves become purely propagative inertial
waves in convection zones. Simultaneously, turbulence in convective regions is
modified by rotation. Indeed, the turbulent energy cascade towards small scales
is slowed down and in the case of rapid rotation, strongly anisotropic
turbulent flows are obtained that can be understood as complex non-linear
triadic interactions of propagative inertial waves. These different behaviours,
due to the action of the Coriolis acceleration, strongly modify the wave
couplings with turbulent flows. On one hand, turbulence weakly influenced by
rotation is coupled with evanescent gravito-inertial waves. On the other hand,
rapidly rotating turbulence is intrinsically and strongly coupled with
sub-inertial waves.

planes. Subcritical here means discontinuous and direct, with strong
hysteresis. This is due to the existence of nontrivial flow regimes between the
global stability threshold Re_g, the upper bound for unconditional return to
the base flow, and the linear instability threshold Re_c characterized by
unconditional departure from the base flow. The transitional range around Re_g
is first discussed from an empirical viewpoint ({\S}1). The recent
determination of Re_g for pipe flow by Avila et al. (2011) is recalled. Plane
Couette flow is next examined. In laboratory conditions, its transitional range
displays an oblique pattern made of alternately laminar and turbulent bands, up
to a third threshold Re_t beyond which turbulence is uniform. Our current
theoretical understanding of the problem is next reviewed ({\S}2): linear
theory and non-normal amplification of perturbations; nonlinear approaches and
dynamical systems, basin boundaries and chaotic transients in minimal flow
units; spatiotemporal chaos in extended systems and the use of concepts from
statistical physics, spatiotemporal intermittency and directed percolation,

Moreover, CIR processes are mathematically interesting due to the irregular
square root function in the diffusion coefficient. In the literature, positive
strong convergence rates for numerical approximations of CIR processes have
been established in the case of an inaccessible boundary point. Since
calibrations of the Heston model frequently result in parameters such that the
boundary is accessible, we focus on this interesting case. Our main result
shows for every $p \in (0, \infty)$ that the drift-implicit square-root Euler
approximations proposed in Alfonsi (2005) converge in the strong $L^p$-distance
with a positive rate for half of the parameter regime in which the boundary
point is accessible. A key step in our proof is temporal regularity of Bessel

  Any graph is $(tw+2)$-mixing, where $tw$ is the treewidth of the graph

constant factor for a fixed $\chi(G)$. The graph classes are also optimal in
some sense: one of the smallest interesting superclass of distance-hereditary
graphs corresponds to comparability graphs, for which no such property holds
(even when relaxing the constraint on the length of the sequence). As for
cographs, they are equivalently the graphs with no induced $P_4$, and there

connection is then shown that quantum consensus over the quantum graph is
equivalent to componentwise classical consensus over the induced graph, which
allows various existing works on classical consensus to be applicable to the

many processes. It results from the complex interplay between flow deformations
and molecular diffusion, which is generally assumed to control the
homogenization processes. In this work we demonstrate on the contrary that
despite fixed flow and self-diffusion conditions, the chaotic mixing of
colloidal suspensions can be either boosted or inhibited by the sole addition
of trace amount of salt as a co-mixing species. Indeed, this shows that local
saline gradients can trigger a chemically-driven transport phenomenon,
diffusiophoresis, which controls the rate and direction of molecular transport
far more efficiently than usual Brownian diffusion. A simple model combining
the elementary ingredients of chaotic mixing with diffusiophoretic transport of
the colloids allows to rationalize our observations and highlights how
small-scale out-of-equilibrium transport bridges to mixing at much larger
scales in a very effective way. Considering chaotic mixing as a prototypal
building block for turbulent mixing, this suggests that these phenomena,
occurring whenever the chemical environment is inhomogeneous, might bring
interesting perspective from micro-systems up to large-scale situations, with

of tensor-to-scalar perturbations, namely $r$, to be smaller than $0.11$ (95%
CL). This bound rules out the simplest models of inflation. However, recent
data from BICEP2 is in strong tension with this constrain, as it finds a value
$r=0.20^{+0.07}_{-0.05}$ with $r=0$ disfavored at $7.0 \sigma$, which allows
these simplest inflationary models to survive. The remarkable fact is that,
even though the BICEP2 experiment was conceived to search for evidence of
inflation, its experimental data matches correctly theoretical results coming
from the matter bounce scenario (the alternative model to the inflationary
paradigm). More precisely, most bouncing cosmologies do not pass Planck's
constrains due to the smallness of the value of the tensor/scalar ratio $r\leq
0.11$, but with new BICEP2 data some of them fit well with experimental data.
This is the case with the matter bounce scenario in the teleparallel version of
Loop Quantum Cosmology.

scenario of the Universe's evolution. E. Hubble (1929) tested the linearity law
not based on Lemaitre's non-static model, but rather a cumbersome extension of
