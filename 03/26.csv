endpoint of its tidal evolution. During its evolution into the dual-synchronous
state, the equilibrium tidal figures of Pluto and Charon would have also
evolved as angular momentum was transferred from Pluto's spin to Charon's
orbit. The rate of tidal evolution is controlled by Pluto's interior physical
and thermal state. We examine three interior models for Pluto: an
undifferentiated rock/ice mixture, differentiated with ice above rock, and
differentiated with an ocean. For the undifferentiated case without an ocean,
the Pluto-Charon binary does not evolve to its current state unless its
internal temperature $T_i>200$ K, which would likely lead to strong tidal
heating, melting, and differentiation. Without an ocean, Pluto's interior
temperature must be higher than 240 K for Charon to evolve on a time scale less
than the age of the solar system. Further tidal heating would likely create an
ocean. If New Horizons finds evidence of ancient tidally-driven tectonic
activity on either body, the most likely explanation is that Pluto had an
internal ocean during Charon's orbital evolution.

that $c_1^2\leq 5c_2+6b_1$ holds for a large class of surfaces (of general

general type (with additional assumptions such as slopes of Frobenius on

method lies in our use of slopes of Frobenius (and Hodge-Witt assumption which
allows us to control the slope spectral sequence). We also construct new
birational invariants of surfaces. Applying our methods to threefolds, we
characterise Calabi-Yau threefolds with $b_3=0$.

static rugged landscapes is strictly transitory. At early times, an advantage
of recombination arises through the possibility to combine individually
occurring beneficial mutations, but this effect is reversed at longer times by
the much more efficient trapping of recombining populations at local fitness
peaks. These findings are explained by means of well established results for a
setup with only two loci. In accordance with the Red Queen hypothesis the
transitory advantage can be prolonged indefinitely in fluctuating environments,
and it is maximal when the environment fluctuates on the same time scale on

that a zero spin black hole has a mass range of 6,300 - 50,900 M_sun and a

recurrent, even in star formation regions that are physically distant such as
surface mass density profiles varying as $r^{-1}$, or aspect ratios about 0.03
to 0.23. Accretion rates are also recurrently found around $10^{-8} -

2009, Andrews et al., 2009, 2010). Several models have been developed in order
to recover these properties. However, most of them usually simplify the disk
geometry if not its mid-plane temperature. This has major consequences for
modeling the disk evolution over million years and consequently planet
migration. In the present paper, we develop a viscous evolution hydrodynamical
numerical code that determines simultaneously the disk photosphere geometry and
the mid-plane temperature. We then compare our results of long-term simulations
with similar simulations of disks with a constrained geometry along the Chiang
& Goldreich (1997) prescription (dlnH/dlnr = 9/7). We find that the constrained
geometry models provide a good approximation of the disk surface density
evolution. However, they differ significantly regarding the temperature time
evolution. In addition, we find that shadowed regions naturally appear at the
transition between viscously dominated and radiation dominated regions that
falls in the region of planetary formation. We show that $\chi$ (photosphere
height to pressure scale height ratio) cannot be considered as a constant,
consistently with Watanabe et al. (2008). Comparisons with observations show
that all disk naturally evolve toward a shallow surface density disk ($\Sigma
\propto r^{-1}$). The mass flux across the disk stabilizes in about 1 million
year typically.

The feasibility of the approach is first demonstrated on a synthetic brown

noise properties precisions of tens of percent can be obtained for the
molecular abundances and 10s-100s K on the temperature profile. The technique
is then applied to the well studied brown dwarf, Gl 570D. From this spectral
retrieval the spectroscopic radius is constrained to be 0.75 - 0.83

are in agreement with the self-consistent grid modeling results of Saumon et al

suggested to be an unusually dark system from previous kinematic studies. It is
also known for hosting a bright galaxy, NGC 1400, with a large radial velocity
(1200 km s$^{-1}$) with respect to the group center. Previous ROSAT X-ray
observations revealed an extended region of enhanced surface brightness just
eastward of NGC 1400. We investigate the NGC 1407/1400 complex with XMM-Newton
and Chandra observations. We find that the temperature and metallicity of the
enhanced region are different (cooler and more metal rich) than those of the
surrounding group gas, but consistent with those of the ISM in NGC 1400. The
relative velocity of NGC 1400 is large enough that much of its ISM could have
been ram pressure stripped while plunging through the group atmosphere. We
conclude that the enhanced region is likely to be hot gas stripped from the ISM
of NGC 1400. We constrain the motion of NGC 1400 using the the pressure jump at
its associated stagnation front and the total mass profile of the NGC 1407
group. We conclude that NGC 1400 is moving within ~$30^{\circ}$ of the
line-of-sight with Mach number $\mathcal{M}\lesssim3$. We do not detect any
obvious shock features in this complex, perhaps due to the highly line-of-sight
motion of NGC 1400. With an {\sl XMM-Newton} pointing on the relatively relaxed
eastern side of NGC 1407, we derive a hydrostatic mass for this group of
~$\times 10^{13}$ $M_\odot$ within 100 kpc. The total mass extrapolated to the
virial radius (681 kpc) is 3.8$\times 10^{13}$ $M_\odot$, which puts an upper
limit of ~300 $M_\odot/L_{B_\odot}$ on the mass-to-light ratio of this group.
This suggests that the NGC 1407 group is not an unusually dark group.

molecular gas surrounded by cold Hi, surrounded by warm Hi. ii) The velocity of
the various components, with atomic gas generally flowing towards the molecular

of the Hi profiles. This conclusion is tentative, because we do not include

correlation of HISA with molecular gas. We test the suggestion of using the
second derivative of the brightness temperature Hi profile to trace HISA and
molecular gas, finding limitations. On a scale of ~parsecs, some agreement is
obtained between this technique and actual HISA, as well as a correlation
between HISA and N(mol). It quickly deteriorates towards sub-parsec scales. iv)

that the results obtained on a model crystal should be valid for liquids.
However, these considerations provide a benchmark to which the results of the
previous molecular dynamics simulations can be compared. Thus, assuming that
vibrations are plane waves, we derive analytical expressions for the atomic
level stress correlation functions in the classical limit and analyze them.
These results provide, in particular, a recipe for analysis of the atomic level
stress correlation functions in Fourier space and extraction of the wavevector
and frequency dependent information. We also evaluate the energies of the
atomic level stresses. Obtained energies are significantly smaller than the
energies that were obtained in MD simulations of liquids previously. This
result suggests that the average energies of the atomic level stresses in
liquids and glasses are largely determined by the structural disorder. We
discuss this result in the context of equipartition of the atomic level stress
energies. Analysis of the previously published data suggests that it is
possible to speak about configurational and vibrational contributions to the
average energies of the atomic level stresses in a glass state. However, this
separation in a liquid state is problematic. We also consider peak broadening
in the pair distribution function with increase of distance. We find that peak
broadening (by ~40%) occurs due to the transverse vibrational modes, while
contribution from the longitudinal modes does not change with distance.
Finally, we introduce and consider atomic level transverse current correlation
function.

The nTron is a 3-terminal, T-shaped planar device with a gain of ~20 that is
capable of driving impedances of more than 100 k{\Omega}, and operates in
typical ambient magnetic fields at temperatures of 4.2K. The device uses a
localized, Joule-heated hotspot formed in the gate to modulate current flow in

matched it to a theoretical framework, and applied it both as a digital logic

in classical and quantum communications, photon sensing and astronomy, and its

correlated and their signal strengths can rise up to 40% - 60% depending on the

second one is achieved for a mass larger than 90 GeV and the LSP behaves as the
well-tempered neutralino. An advantage of the triplet contribution is that the
well-tempered neutralino can be a Bino-Triplino mixture, relieving the problem
of achieving M_2 ~ M_1 in unified scenarios. The dark matter constraints
strongly affect the Higgs phenomenology, reducing the potential enhancements of
the diphoton and of the Z + photon channels by 20% at most. These enhancements
are however larger than the MSSM ones. In the near future, complementarity of

X-ray underluminous Abell clusters, aiming to unveil properties that may
elucidate the evolutionary stages of the galaxy populations that compose such
systems. To do so, we compared the parameters of their colour-magnitude
relations with the ones found for another sample of 50 ""normal"" X-ray emitting
Abell clusters, both selected in an objective way. The $g$ and $r$ magnitudes
from the SDSS-DR7 were used for constructing the colour-magnitude relations. We
found that both samples show the same trend: the red sequence slopes change
with redshift, but the slopes for X-ray underluminous clusters are always
flatter than those for the normal clusters, by a difference of about 69% along
the surveyed redshift range of 0.05 $\le z <$ 0.20. Also, the intrinsic scatter
of the colour-magnitude relation was found to grow with redshift for both
samples but, for the X-ray underluminous clusters, this is systematically
larger by about 28%. By applying the Cram\'er test to the result of this
comparison between X-ray normal and underluminous cluster samples, we get
probabilities of 92% and 99% that the red sequence slope and intrinsic scatter
distributions, respectively, differ, in the sense that X-ray underluminous
clusters red sequences show flatter slopes and higher scatters in their
relations. No significant differences in the distributions of red-sequence
median colours are found between the two cluster samples. This points to X-ray
underluminous clusters being younger systems than normal clusters, possibly in
the process of accreting groups of galaxies, individual galaxies and gas.

problem is motivated by the question of knowing how to shape and place sensors
in some domain in order to maximize the quality of the observation: for
instance, what is the optimal location and shape of a thermometer? We show that
it is relevant to consider a spectral optimal design problem corresponding to
an average of the classical observability inequality over random initial data,
where the unknown ranges over the set of all possible measurable subsets of
$\Omega$ of fixed measure. We prove that, under appropriate sufficient spectral
assumptions, this optimal design problem has a unique solution, depending only
on a finite number of modes, and that the optimal domain is semi-analytic and
thus has a finite number of connected components. This result is in strong
contrast with hyperbolic conservative equations (wave and Schr\""odinger)
studied in [56] for which relaxation does occur. We also provide examples of
applications to anomalous diffusion or to the Stokes equations. In the case
where the underlying operator is any positive (possible fractional) power of
the negative of the Dirichlet-Laplacian, we show that, surprisingly enough, the
complexity of the optimal domain may strongly depend on both the geometry of
the domain and on the positive power. The results are illustrated with several
numerical simulations.

reversing the sign of antiphase magnetization. A one-to-one correspondence is
demonstrated between the sign of $2S_yI_z$ and the sense of the S-spin coupling
evolution, with magnetization $S_x$ refocused when $\int 2S_yI_z\,dt = 0$. The
exact instantaneous coupling at any time during the decoupling sequence is
readily obtained in terms of the system states, showing that the creation of
two-spin coherence is crucial for reducing the coupling, as required during the
refocusing process. Representative examples from standard cyclic, periodic
composite-pulse and adiabatic decoupling sequences illustrate the decoupling
mechanism. More general aperiodic sequences, obtained using optimal control,
realize the potential inherent in the theory for significantly improved
decoupling. The recently derived equivalence between the dynamics of any
N-level quantum system and a system of classical coupled harmonic oscillators
provides additional insight into the mechanics of decoupling.

order of magnitude in the future. While the current data is in excellent
agreement with the standard model, the possible future improvement in the error

interest in the electron anomalous magnetic moment as a possible probe of new
physics beyond the standard model. In this work we give an analysis of such
physics in an extension of the minimal supersymmetric standard model with a
vector multiplet. In the extended model the electroweak contribution to the
anomalous magnetic moment of the electron include loop diagrams involving in
addition to the exchange of W and Z, the exchange of charginos, sneutrinos and
mirror sneutrinos, and the exchange of neutralinos, sleptons and mirror
sleptons. The analysis shows that a contribution to the electron magnetic
moment much larger than expected by $m_e^2/m_\mu^2$ scaling of the deviation of
the muon anomalous magnetic moment over the standard model prediction, i.e.,
$\Delta a_\mu = 3 \times 10^{-9}$ as given by the Brookhaven experiment, can be
gotten within the MSSM extension. Effects of CP violating phases in the
extended MSSM model on the corrections to the supersymmetric electroweak
contributions to $a_e$ are also investigated. The analysis points to the
possibility of detection of new physics effects with modest improvement on the

The existence of lithium-rich low-mass red giant stars still
represents a challenge for stellar evolution models. Stellar clusters are
privileged environments for this kind of investigation. Aims. To investigate
the chemical abundance pattern of the old open cluster Trumpler\,5, we observed
a sample of four red-clump stars with high-resolution optical spectrographs.
One of them (#3416) reveals extremely strong lithium lines in its spectrum.
Methods. One-dimensional, local thermodynamic equilibrium analysis was
performed on the spectra of the observed stars. A 3D-NLTE analysis was
performed to derive the lithium abundance of star #3416. Results. Star #3416 is
super Li-rich with A(Li)=3.75\,dex. The lack of $^6$Li enrichment
($^6$Li/$^7$Li$<$2%), the low carbon isotopic ratio
($^{12}$C/$^{13}$C=14$\pm$3), and the lack of evidence for radial velocity
variation or enhanced rotational velocity ($v\sin i = 2.8\,$\kms) all suggest
that lithium production has occurred in this star through the Cameron & Fowler
mechanism. Conclusions. We identified a super Li-rich core helium-burning,
red-clump star in an open cluster. Internal production is the most likely cause
of the observed enrichment. Given the expected short duration of a star's
Li-rich phase, enrichment is likely to have occurred at the red clump or in the
immediately preceding phases, namely during the He-flash at the tip of the red
giant branch (RGB) or while ascending the brightest portion of the RGB.

Consistently, strong-line methods based on the available line ratios suggest
that J1000+0221S is an extremely metal-poor galaxy, with a metallicity of
12+log(O/H) < 7.44 (< 5% solar), placing it among the most metal-poor
star-forming galaxies at z > 3 discovered so far. In combination with its low
stellar mass (2x10^8 Msun) and high star formation rate (5 Msun/yr), the
metallicity of J1000+0221S is consistent with the extrapolation to low masses
of the mass-metallicity relation traced by Lyman-break galaxies at z > 3, but
it is 0.55 dex lower than predicted by the fundamental metallicity relation at
z < 2.5. These observations suggest the picture of a rapidly growing galaxy,
possibly fed by the massive accretion of pristine gas. Additionally, deep
LBT/LBC in the UGR bands are used to derive a limit to the LyC escape fraction,
thus allowing us to explore for the first time the regime of sub-L* galaxies at
z > 3. We find a 1sigma upper limit to the escape fraction of 23%, which adds a
new observational constraint to recent theoretical models predicting that
sub-L* galaxies at high-z have high escape fractions and thus are the

independent. As the formulation relates amplitudes to the same amplitudes with
additional soft or collinear particles, it includes as special cases the

family of black hole solutions depending on a unique integration constant and
parameterized in terms of the nonminimal coupling parameter. Imposing the
absence of naked singularities restricts the parameters in such a way that the
field vanishes at infinity and fixes the metric to be asymptotically AdS.
Within this family of solutions it is possible to find a black hole supported
by a minimally coupled scalar field and therefore the existence of these
solutions is not inherent to the presence of the nonminimal coupling. The Wald
formula for the entropy, being proportional to the lapse function evaluated at
the horizon, yields a zero entropy in spite of the fact that the solution has a
non zero temperature. As a consequence, the unique integration constant may be
interpreted as a sort of gravitational hair. As in the source free case, we
show that the same field equations admit as well asymptotically Lifshitz black
hole solutions in a different region of the space of parameters. These Lifshitz
solutions are divided in three families for which all the parameters entering
in the action may be expressed in term of the dynamical exponent.

electron transfer, though typically at a rate that differs from that given by
the Marcus-Jortner expression; (iii) that the ability of the molecular switch
to discriminate between the presence and absence of the odorant, and its
sensitivity to the odorant vibrational frequency, are enhanced significantly in
this strong dissipation regime, when compared to the case without mode
dissipation; and (iv) that details of the environment absent from previous

the development of many fields in science and engineering. As Albert Einstein
was once quoted to say: 'Everything must be made as simple as possible, but not
one bit simpler'. The simplicity of an idea brings versatility of that idea
into a broader domain, while its complexity describes the foundation upon which
the idea stands. One of the well-known and powerful examples of such balance is
in the Boolean algebra and its impact on the birth of digital electronics and
digital information age. The simplicity of using only two numbers of '0' and
'1' in describing an arbitrary quantity made the fields of digital electronics
and digital signal processing powerful and ubiquitous. Here, inspired by the
simplicity of digital electrical systems we propose to apply an analogous idea
to the field of metamaterials, namely, to develop the notion of digital
metamaterials. Specifically, we investigate how one can synthesize an
electromagnetic metamaterial with desired materials parameters, e.g., with a
desired permittivity, using only two elemental materials, which we call
'metamaterial bits' with two distinct permittivity functions, as building
blocks. We demonstrate, analytically and numerically, how proper spatial
mixtures of such metamaterial bits leads to 'metamaterial bytes' with material
parameters different from the parameters of metamaterial bits. We also explore
the role of relative spatial orders of such digital materials bits in
constructing different parameters for the digital material bytes. We then apply
this methodology to several design examples such as flat graded-index digital
lens, cylindrical scatterers, digital constructs for epsilon-near-zero (ENZ)
supercoupling, and digital hyperlens, highlighting the power and simplicity of
this methodology and algorithm.

configurations where instead of a single history, several distinct histories of
equal weight dominate their dynamical evolution. As we show, the structure of
the singularities can be rather rich. We identify numerically analogues in
configuration space of first order phase transition lines ending at a critical
point and analogues of tricritical points. First order lines terminating at a
critical point appear when there are configurations whose dynamical evolution
is controlled by two distinct histories with equal weight. Tricritical point
analogues emerge when there are configurations whose dynamical evolution is
controlled by three distinct histories with equal weight. A numerical analysis
suggests that the structure of the singularities can be described by a Landau
like theory. Finally, in the limit of an infinite bulk bias we identify
singularities which arise from a competition of s histories, with s arbitrary.
In this case we show that all the singularities can be described by a Landau

topologically ordered state can realize symmetry in distinct ways , leading to
a variety of symmetry enriched topological (SET) phases. While the symmetry
fractionalization must be consistent with the fusion and braiding rules of the
anyons, not all ostensibly consistent symmetry fractionalizations can be
realized in 2D systems. Instead, certain `anomalous' SETs can only occur on the
surface of a 3D symmetry protected topological (SPT) phase. In this paper we
describe a procedure for determining whether an SET of a discrete, onsite,
unitary symmetry group $G$ is anomalous or not. The basic idea is to gauge the
symmetry and expose the anomaly as an obstruction to a consistent topological
theory combining both the original anyons and the gauge fluxes. Utilizing a
result of Etingof, Nikshych, and Ostrik, we point out that a class of
obstructions are captured by the fourth cohomology group $H^4( G, \,U(1))$,
which also precisely labels the set of 3D SPT phases, with symmetry group $G$.
We thus establish a general bulk-boundary correspondence between the anomalous
SET and the 3d bulk SPT whose surface termination realizes it. We illustrate
this idea using the chiral spin liquid ($U(1)_2$) topological order with a
reduced symmetry $\mathbb{Z}_2 \times \mathbb{Z}_2 \subset SO(3)$, which can
act on the semion quasiparticle in an anomalous way. We construct exactly
solved 3d SPT models realizing the anomalous surface terminations, and
demonstrate that they are non-trivial by computing three loop braiding
statistics. Possible extensions to anti-unitary symmetries are also discussed.

couple to spin and valley currents). The main effect of disorder is to induce
multifractal scaling in surface state wavefunctions. These critically

effects to all orders, and provides a framework for a controlled perturbative
expansion; the inverse spin or thermal conductance is the small parameter. For

diffusion mechanisms, and jump frequencies to neighboring sites. The method of
perturbed angular correlation of gamma rays (PAC) has been applied over the
past decade to study impurity diffusion through measurement of nuclear
quadrupole interactions (NQI) at nuclei of 111In/Cd probe atoms. Extensive
measurements have been made on highly-ordered compounds having the L12 crystal
structure, including In3R, Sn3R, Ga3R, Al3R and Pd3R phases (R= rare-earth
element). Measurements in thermal equilibrium at high temperature served to
determine lattice locations of 111In parent probe-atoms, through characteristic
NQIs, and to measure diffusional jump-frequencies of 111Cd daughter
probe-atoms, through relaxation of the NQI. This paper summarizes results of
the jump-frequency measurements and relates them to the conventional
diffusivity. ... A change in diffusion mechanism was proposed in 2009 to
explain jump-frequency systematics for In3R phases. An alternative explanation
is proposed in the present paper based on site-preferences of 111Cd daughter
probes newly observed along the parallel Pd3R series. The diffusivity can be
expressed as the product of a jump-frequency such as measured in these studies
and a correlation factor for diffusion that depends on the diffusion mechanism.
The correlation factor can be modeled for the L12 structure and diffusion
sublattice of interest using a five-frequency model originally proposed for
metals. Although the correlation factor is an essential parameter for the
diffusion of impurities, it has never been measured. It is suggested that
values of the correlation factor can be determined feasibly by combining
results of jump-frequency measurements such as the present ones with
diffusivity measurements made for the same host-impurity systems.

The self-organization of 5,10,15,20-tetra(p-hydroxyphenyl)porphyrin (H2THPP)
molecules leads to two molecular arrangements on Au(111). One of these is
characterized by pair-wise hydrogen bonding between hydroxyl groups and a low
packing density which enables a rotation of individual molecules in the
structure. A different interaction with stronger chain-like hydrogen bonding
and additional interactions of phenyl groups was observed for the second
structure. The influence of the substrate on the epitaxial behavior is
demonstrated by the adsorption of H2THPP on the highly anisotropic Ag(110)
substrate. There, several balances between the occupation of favorable
adsorption positions and the number of hydrogen bonds per molecule were found.
The molecules form molecular chains on Ag(110) and also assemble into
two-dimensional periodic arrangements of differently sized close-packed blocks
similar to the second type of supramolecular ordering found on Au(111).
Dispersion corrected Density Functional Theory calculations were applied to
understand the adsorption and complex epitaxy of these molecules. It is shown
that the azimuthal orientation of the saddle-shape deformed molecule plays an
important role not only for the intermolecular but also for the

desirable for the solution of hyperbolic PDEs. These methods can advantageously
be coupled with high order strong stability preserving time discretizations.
The search for high order strong stability time-stepping methods with large
allowable strong stability coefficient has been an active area of research over
the last two decades. This research has shown that explicit SSP Runge--Kutta
methods exist only up to fourth order. However, if we restrict ourselves to
solving only linear autonomous problems, the order conditions simplify and this
order barrier is lifted: explicit SSP Runge--Kutta methods of any linear order
exist. These methods reduce to second order when applied to nonlinear problems.
In the current work we aim to find explicit SSP Runge--Kutta methods with large
allowable time-step, that feature high linear order and simultaneously have the
optimal fourth order nonlinear order. These methods have strong stability
coefficients that approach those of the linear methods as the number of stages
and the linear order is increased. This work shows that when a high linear
order method is desired, it may be still be worthwhile to use methods with
higher nonlinear order.

generalization of the roaming mechanism to the Ketene isomerization reaction by
applying our phase space approach previously used to elucidate the roaming

the trapping of trajectories in a phase space region between two dividing
surfaces; trajectories are classified as reactive or nonreactive, and are
further naturally classified as direct or non-direct (roaming). The latter
long-lived trajectories are trapped in the region of non-linear mechanical
resonances, which in turn define alternative reaction pathways in phase space.
It is demonstrated that resonances associated with periodic orbits provide a
dynamical explanation of the quantum mechanical resonances found in the
isomerization rate constant calculations by Gezelter and Miller [J.\ Chem.\
Phys.\ {\bf 103}, 7868-7876 (1995)]. Evidence of the trapping of trajectories

Colorado Learning Attitudes about Science Survey (CLASS) and the Maryland
Physics Expectations Survey (MPEX) to answer several questions: (1) How does
physics instruction impact students' beliefs? (2) When do physics majors
develop expert-like beliefs? and (3) How do students' beliefs impact their
learning of physics? We report that in typical physics classes, students'
beliefs deteriorate or at best stay the same. There are a few types of
interventions, including an explicit focus on model-building and/or developing
expert- like beliefs that lead to significant improvements in beliefs. Further,
small courses and those for elementary education and non-science majors also
result in improved beliefs. However, because the available data oversamples
certain types of classes, it is unclear whether these improvements are actually
due to the interventions, or due to the small class size, or student population
typical of the kinds of classes in which these interventions are most often
used. Physics majors tend to enter their undergraduate education with more
expert-like beliefs than non-majors and these beliefs remain relatively stable
throughout their undergraduate careers. Thus, typical physics courses appear to
be selecting students who already have strong beliefs, rather than supporting
students in developing strong beliefs. There is a small correlation between
students' incoming beliefs about physics and their gains on conceptual
mechanics surveys. This suggests that students with more expert-like incoming
beliefs may learn more in their physics courses, but this finding should be
further explored and replicated. Some unanswered questions remain. To answer
these questions, we advocate several specific types of future studies.

combinations of the sea quarks such as $\bar d-\bar u$. As our first attempt to
improve the result, we make the statistical parameters to depend on $Q^2$,
using different values of Gottfried sum rule. The related results are
indicating better behavior by accessing to the PDFs while they contain the
$Q^2$ dependence parameters. As a further task and in order to have more
improvement in the calculations, a linear potential is considered to describe
the quark interactions. The solution of the related Dirac equation yields the
Airy function and is considered as a wave function in spatial space. Using the
fourier transformation the wave functions are obtained in momentum space. Based
on the light-front kinematic variables and using a special method which we call
it ""k method"", these functions can be written in terms of the Bjorken
$x$-variable. Following that the statistical features are accompanied with
these functions. Considering an effective approach which is used in this

converges with optimal complexity for convex optimization problems whose
feasible region is simple enough. This includes cases where the objective
function is non-smooth, smooth, have composite/saddle structure, or are given
by an inexact oracle model. We unified the way of constructing the subproblems
which are necessary to be solved at each iteration of these methods. This
permitted us to analyze the convergence of these methods in a unified way
compared to previous results which required different approaches for each
method/algorithm. Our contribution rely on two well-known methods in non-smooth
convex optimization: the mirror-descent method by Nemirovski-Yudin and the
dual-averaging method by Nesterov. Therefore, our family of methods includes
them and many other methods as particular cases. For instance, the proposed
family of classical gradient methods and its accelerations generalize Devolder
et al.'s, Nesterov's primal/dual gradient methods, and Tseng's accelerated
proximal gradient methods. Also our family of methods can partially become
special cases of other universal methods, too. As an additional contribution,
the novel extended mirror-descent method removes the compactness assumption of
the feasible region and the fixation of the total number of iterations which is
required by the original mirror-descent method in order to attain the optimal
complexity.

heavy stop masses, if a universal soft squared mass is assumed for the chiral
superpartners and the Higgs boson at the grand unification (GUT) scale, and a
focus point (FP) of m_{h_u}^2 appears around the stop mass scale. The
challenges in the FP scenario are (1) a too heavy stop mass (~ 5 TeV) needed
for the 126 GeV Higgs mass and (2) the too high gluino mass bound (> 1.4 TeV).
For a successful FP scenario, we consider (1) a superheavy right-hand (RH)
neutrino and (2) the first and second generations of hierarchically heavier
chiral superpartners. The RH neutrino can move a FP in the higher energy
direction in the space of (Q, m_{h_u}^2(Q)), where Q denotes the
renormalization scale. On the other hand, the hierarchically heavier chiral
superpartners can lift up a FP in that space through two-loop gauge
interactions. Precise focusing of m_{h_u}^2(Q) is achieved with the RH neutrino
mass of ~ 10^{14} GeV together with an order one (0.9-1.2) Dirac Yukawa
coupling to the Higgs boson, and the hierarchically heavy masses of 15-20 TeV
for the heavier generations of superpartners, when the U(1)_R breaking soft
parameters, m_{1/2} and A_0 are set to be 1 TeV at the GUT scale. Those values
can naturally explain the small neutrino mass through the seesaw mechanism, and
suppress the flavor violating processes in supersymmetric models.

minimizing some measure of variability in rewards in addition to maximizing a
standard criterion. Variance related risk measures are among the most common
risk-sensitive criteria in finance and operations research. However, optimizing
many such criteria is known to be a hard problem. In this paper, we consider
both discounted and average reward Markov decision processes. For each
formulation, we first define a measure of variability for a policy, which in
turn gives us a set of risk-sensitive criteria to optimize. For each of these
criteria, we derive a formula for computing its gradient. We then devise
actor-critic algorithms that operate on three timescales - a TD critic on the
fastest timescale, a policy gradient (actor) on the intermediate timescale, and
a dual ascent for Lagrange multipliers on the slowest timescale. In the
discounted setting, we point out the difficulty in estimating the gradient of
the variance of the return and incorporate simultaneous perturbation approaches
to alleviate this. The average setting, on the other hand, allows for an actor
update using compatible features to estimate the gradient of the variance. We
establish the convergence of our algorithms to locally risk-sensitive optimal
policies. Finally, we demonstrate the usefulness of our algorithms in a traffic
signal control application.

in a variety of applications, including photon-limited imaging systems based on
compressed sensing. Most prior theoretical results in compressed sensing and
related inverse problems apply to idealized settings where the noise is i.i.d.,
and do not account for signal-dependent noise and physical sensing constraints.
Prior results on Poisson compressed sensing with signal-dependent noise and
physical constraints provided upper bounds on mean squared error performance
for a specific class of estimators. However, it was unknown whether those
bounds were tight or if other estimators could achieve significantly better
performance. This work provides minimax lower bounds on mean-squared error for
sparse Poisson inverse problems under physical constraints. Our lower bounds
are complemented by minimax upper bounds. Our upper and lower bounds reveal
that due to the interplay between the Poisson noise model, the sparsity
constraint and the physical constraints: (i) the mean-squared error does not
depend on the sample size $n$ other than to ensure the sensing matrix satisfies
RIP-like conditions and the intensity $T$ of the input signal plays a critical
role; and (ii) the mean-squared error has two distinct regimes, a low-intensity
and a high-intensity regime and the transition point from the low-intensity to
high-intensity regime depends on the input signal $f^*$. In the low-intensity
regime the mean-squared error is independent of $T$ while in the high-intensity
regime, the mean-squared error scales as $\frac{s \log p}{T}$, where $s$ is the
sparsity level, $p$ is the number of pixels or parameters and $T$ is the signal

para lines of H2 and H3+ in the diffuse ISM showed a puzzling discrepancy in
nuclear spin excitation temperatures and populations between these two key
species. H3+, unlike H2, seems to be out of thermal equilibrium, contrary to
the predictions of modern astrochemical models. We conduct the first
time-dependent modeling of the para-fractions of H2 and H3+ in the diffuse ISM
and compare our results to a set of line-of-sight observations, including new
measurements presented in this study. We isolate a set of key reactions for H3+

dissociative recombination largely control its ortho/para ratio. A plausible
agreement with observations cannot be achieved unless a ratio larger than 1:5
for the destruction of (1,1)- and (1,0)-states of H3+ is assumed. Additionally,
an increased CR ionization rate to 10(-15) 1/s further improves the fit whereas
variations of other individual physical parameters, such as density and
chemical age, have only a minor effect on the predicted ortho/para ratios. Thus
our study calls for new laboratory measurements of the dissociative

frameworks for physics at that energies - supersymmetry, models of a composite
Higgs boson, and the Standard Model itself. At the same time, precision
experiments in flavour physics require a highly non-generic structure of
flavour and CP transitions. In any model of electroweak symmetry breaking with
a relatively low scale of new phenomena, as motivated by naturalness, some
mechanism has to be found in order to keep unwanted flavour effects under
control. We devote particular attention to the consequences of the approximate
U(2)^3 symmetry exhibited by the quarks of the Standard Model. The combined
analysis of the indirect constraints from flavour, Higgs and electroweak
physics will allow us to outline a picture of some most natural models of
physics near the Fermi scale. Although non trivially, a few models emerge that
look capable of accommodating a 125 GeV Higgs boson, consistently with all the
other constraints, with new particles in an interesting range for discovery at
the LHC, as well as associated flavour signals. This is particularly
interesting in view of the forthcoming improvements in the direct experimental
investigation of that energies. Finally, the measurement of the last parameter
of the Standard Model - the Higgs quartic coupling - has important consequences
even if no new physics is present close to the Fermi scale: its near-critical
value, which puts the electroweak vacuum in a metastable state close to a phase
transition, may have an interesting connection with Planck-scale physics. We
derive the bound for electroweak vacuum stability with full two-loop precision,

limit (where a large number of particles are inside the vortex core) the
superfluid dynamics is determined by saddle points of Popov's action, which, in
particular, allows for weak solutions of the Gross-Pitaevskii equation. We
solve the resulting equations of motion for a vortex moving with respect to the
superfluid and find the reconstruction of the vortex core to be a non-analytic
function of the force applied on the vortex. This response produces an
anomalously large dipole moment of the vortex and, as a result, the spectrum
associated with the vortex motion exhibits narrow resonances lying {\em within}
the phonon part of the spectrum, contrary to traditional view.

particular, we use numerical model simulations based on solving the focused
transport equation in the 3-dimensional Parker interplanetary magnetic field to
put constraints on the proper- ties of particle transport coefficients both in
the direction perpendicular and parallel to the magnetic field. To simulate the
effect of field lines that may alternatively connect and disconnect an observer
from a compact SEP source on the solar surface, we place several smaller SEP
sources that release particles impulsively and simultaneously at separate
longitudes on the solar surface. We let magnetic flux tubes filled or devoid of
energetic particles pass the observer. The perpendicular particle diffusion
tends to smooth out the intensity variation. Our calculations of the temporal
intensity profile of 0.5 and 5 MeV protons at the Earth show that the
perpendicular diffusion must be small enough while the parallel mean free path
should be long in order to reproduce the phenomenon of SEP dropouts. When the
parallel mean free path is a fraction of 1 AU and the observer is located at 1
AU, the perpendicular to parallel diffusion ratio must be below $10^{-5}$ if we
want to see the particle flux dropping by at least several times within three
hours. When the observer is located at a larger solar radial distance, the
perpendicular to parallel diffusion ratio for reproducing the dropouts should
be even lower than that in the case of 1 AU distance. A shorter parallel mean
free path or a larger radial distance from the source to observer will cause
the particles to arrive later, making the effect of perpendicular diffusion
more prominent and SEP dropouts disappear.

evolution to traditional adiabatic evolutions? We address this by showing that
coherent control and measurement provides a way to average different adiabatic
evolutions in ways that cause their diabatic errors to cancel, allowing for
adiabatic evolutions to combine the best characteristics of existing adiabatic
optimizations strategies that are mutually exclusive in conventional adiabatic
QIP. This result shows that coherent control and measurement can provide
advantages for adiabatic state preparation. We also provide upper bounds on the

positive charge solvated in superfluid helium is identified as triatomic He3^+
ion, which is bound to the surrounding ground state helium atoms through the
charge - charge induced dipole interaction in a pairwise additive manner.
Bosonic density functional theory calculations show that this ion forms the
well-known Atkins' snowball solvation structure where the first rigid helium
shell is effectively disconnected from the rest of the liquid. Evaluation of
the total energy vs. helium droplet size N shows distinct regions related to
the completion of solvent shells near N=16 and N=47. These regions can be
assigned to magic numbers observed in positively charged helium droplets
appearing at N=15 and in the range between 20-50 helium atoms. The calculated
added mass for the positive ion in bulk superfluid helium (18 m_He) is much
smaller than the previous experiments suggest (30-40 m_He) indicating that
there may be yet some unidentified additional factor contributing to the
measured effective mass. Both previous experiments and the present calculations
agree on the effective mass of the negative charge (240-250 m_He). The main
difference between the solvated negative and positive charges in liquid helium
is that the latter forms a chemically bound triatomic molecule surrounded by
highly inhomogeneous liquid structure whereas the former remains as a separated
charge with a smoothly varying liquid density around it.

projections onto non-unitary eigenspaces for spectral operators of scalar-type
on locally convex linear topological spaces. For spectral operators with
dominating point spectrum, the projections take the form of Laplace averages,
which are a generalization of the Fourier averages used when the spectrum is
unitary. Inverse iteration and Laplace averages project onto eigenspaces of
spectral operators with minimal point spectrum. Two classes of dynamical
systems --- attracting fixed points in $\mathbb{C}^{d}$ and attracting limit
cycles in $\mathbb{R}^{2}$ --- and their respective spaces of observables are
given for which the associated composition operator is spectral. It is shown
that the natural spaces of observables are completions with an $\ell^{2}$
polynomial norm of a space of polynomials over a normed unital commutative
ring. These spaces are generalizations of the Hardy spaces $H^{2}(\mathbb{D})$
and $H^{2}(\mathbb{D}^{d})$. Elements of the ring are observables defined on
the attractor --- the fixed point or the limit cycle, in our examples.
Furthermore, we are able to provide a (semi)global spectral theorem for the
composition operators associated with a large class of dissipative nonlinear
dynamical systems; any sufficiently smooth dynamical system topologically
conjugate to either of the two cases above admits an observable space on which
the associated Koopman operator is spectral. It is conjectured that this is

extraction of the symmetry energy coefficients is strongly correlated with the
forms of the Coulomb energy and the mass dependence of the symmetry energy
coefficient adopted. The values of the extracted symmetry energy coefficients
increase by about 2 MeV for heavy nuclei when the Coulomb correction term is
involved. We obtain the bulk symmetry energy coefficient $S_0=28.26\pm1.3$ MeV
and the surface-to-volume ratio $\kappa=1.26\pm 0.25 $ MeV if assuming the mass
dependence of symmetry energy coefficient $a_{\rm
sym}(A)=S_0(1-\kappa/A^{1/3})$, and $S_0=32.80\pm1.7$ MeV, $\kappa=2.82\pm0.57$

exponential type of average bit error rate (BER) for each data stream. Under
the constraints of a given fixed individual outage probability (OP) and average
BER for each subchannel, based on a traditional upper bound and a dynamic upper
bound of Q function, two closed-form ATP expressions are derived, respectively,
and they correspond to two different power allocation schemes. Numerical

  fluids?","A conference paper of American Physical Society 67th Annual DFD
  Meeting",,,,"physics.flu-dyn","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The Navier-Stokes equations are the governing equations of fluid flows. They
are deemed to embody all physics in a flow of Newtonian fluids like water,
especially when we assume the fluid is incompressible. Fluid flows are usually
described in the Eulerian perspective wherein we focus on the fluid's
quantities at a fixed point in space as time processes, rather than the motion
of each individual particle. The latter perspective is indeed the Lagrangian
perspective which is widely used in solid mechanics like elasticity. Thus, the
Navier-Stokes equations should be and indeed they are always used in the
Eulerian perspective. Here we show the right-hand sides of the Navier-Stokes
equations were derived not in the Eulerian perspective but rather in the
Lagrangian perspective, because the strain rates used in the derivation were
the Lagrangian Cauchy strain rates. Thus, for describing fluid flows in the
Eulerian perspective, the Navier-Stokes equations may lost some physics. To
make it sure, we put the Cauchy strain into the material derivative, and then
derive the Eulerian Cauchy strain rates. We find the difference between the
Eulerian and the Lagrangian Cauchy strain rates is significant when in a
turbulent flow. Therefore, On the basis of the Eulerian Cauchy strain rates, we
derive a new set of governing equations for the flow of Newtonian fluids. The
newly derived governing equations are fully in the Eulerian perspective. We
believe they are the real equations that Navier, Cauchy, Poisson and Stokes
intended to find for the viscous flow of Newtonian fluids.

domain by using discrete least-squares projection with random points
evaluations. Particular attention are given to functions with random Gaussian
or Gamma parameters. We first demonstrate that the traditional Hermite
(Laguerre) polynomials chaos expansion suffers from the \textit{instability} in
the sense that an \textit{unfeasible} number of points, which is relevant to
the dimension of the approximation space, is needed to guarantee the stability
in the least square framework. We then propose to use the Hermite/Laguerre {\em
functions} (rather than polynomials) as bases in the expansion. The
corresponding design points are obtained by mapping the uniformly distributed
random points in bounded intervals to the unbounded domain, which involved a
mapping parameter $L$. By using the Hermite/Laguerre {\em functions} and a
proper mapping parameter, the stability can be significantly improved even if
the number of design points scales \textit{linearly} (up to a logarithmic
factor) with the dimension of the approximation space. Apart from the
stability, another important issue is the rate of convergence. To speed up the
convergence, an effective scaling factor is introduced, and a principle for
choosing quasi-optimal scaling factor is discussed. Applications to parametric
uncertainty quantification are illustrated by considering a random ODE model
together with an elliptic problem with lognormal random input.

empirical measure of the particle filter converges weakly to the true filtering
measure. The result extends the previously derived conditions by not requiring
the boundedness of the importance weights, but only boundedness of second or
fourth order moments. We show that the boundedness of the second order moments
of the weights implies the convergence of the estimates bounded functions in
the mean square sense, and the $L^4$ convergence as well as the empirical
measure convergence are assured by the boundedness of the fourth order moments
of the weights. We also present an example class of models and importance
distributions where the moment conditions hold, but the boundedness does not.
The unboundedness in these models is caused by point-singularities in the
weights which still leave the weight moments bounded. We show by using
simulated data that the particle filter for this kind of model also performs
well in practice.

conductivity from electrical impedance tomography measurements. As in the
conventional difference imaging, the reconstruction of the conductivity change
is based on electrical potential measurements from the exterior boundary of the
target before and after the change. In this paper, however, images of the
conductivity before and after the change are reconstructed simultaneously based
on the two data sets. The key feature of the approach is that the conductivity
after the change is parameterized as a linear combination of the initial state
and the change. This allows for modeling independently the spatial
characteristics of the background conductivity and the change of the
conductivity - by separate regularization functionals. The approach also allows
in a straightforward way the restriction of the conductivity change to a
localized region of interest inside the domain. While conventional difference
imaging reconstruction is based on a global linearization of the observation
model, the proposed approach amounts to solving a non-linear inverse problem.
The feasibility of the proposed reconstruction method is tested experimentally
and with a simulation which demonstrates a potential new medical application of
electrical impedance tomography: imaging of vocal folds in voice loading

large enough the impurities will form a bound state (the bipolaron). As a
function of the mutual repulsion between the impurities two types of bipolaron
are distinguished: a tightly bound bipolaron at weak repulsion and a dumbbell
bipolaron at strong repulsion. Apart from the binding energy, also the
evolution of the bipolaron radius and its effective mass are examined as a
function of the strength of the repulsive interaction between the impurities
and of the polaronic cupling strength. We then apply the strong-coupling
formalism to multiple impuritiy atoms in a condensate which leads to the
prediction of multi-polaron formation in the strong coupling regime. The
results of the two formalisms are compared for two impurities in a condensate

the polaronic coupling strength is in principle tunable with a Feshbach

August 2009 to January 2012. Its noise and sensitivity performance were
excellent, but the rate of cosmic ray impacts on the HFI detectors was
unexpectedly high. Furthermore, collisions of cosmic rays with the focal plane
produced transient signals in the data (glitches) with a wide range of
characteristics. A study of cosmic ray impacts on the HFI detector modules has
been undertaken to categorize and characterize the glitches, to correct the HFI
time-ordered data, and understand the residual effects on Planck maps and data
products. This paper presents an evaluation of the physical origins of glitches
observed by the HFI detectors. In order to better understand the glitches
observed by HFI in flight, several ground-based experiments were conducted with
flight-spare HFI bolometer modules. The experiments were conducted between 2010
and 2013 with HFI test bolometers in different configurations using varying
particles and impact energies. The bolometer modules were exposed to 23 MeV
protons from the Orsay IPN TANDEM accelerator, and to $^{241}$Am and $^{244}$Cm
$\alpha$-particle and $^{55}$Fe radioactive X-ray sources. The calibration data
from the HFI ground-based preflight tests were used to further characterize the
glitches and compare glitch rates with statistical expectations under
laboratory conditions. Test results provide strong evidence that the dominant
family of glitches observed in flight are due to cosmic ray absorption by the
silicon die substrate on which the HFI detectors reside. Glitch energy is
propagated to the thermistor by ballistic phonons, while there is also a
thermal diffusion contribution. The implications of these results for future
satellite missions, especially those in the far-infrared to sub-millimetre and
millimetre regions of the electromagnetic spectrum, are discussed.

It is known that there exists a holomorphic jet differential P (of order k)

resulting from their interaction with surrounding interstellar material. The
properties of these features as well as the processes involved in their
formation are still poorly understood. We aim at understanding the physical
mechanisms that shapes the dust arc observed near the runaway O star AEAur
(HD34078). We obtained and analyzed a high spatial resolution map of the
CO(1-0) emission that is centered on HD34078, and that combines data from both
the IRAM interferometer and 30m single-dish antenna. The line of sight towards
HD34078 intersects the outer part of one of the detected globulettes, which
accounts for both the properties of diffuse UV light observed in the field and
the numerous molecular absorption lines detected in HD34078's spectra,
including those from highly excited H2 . Their modeled distance from the star
is compatible with the fact that they lie on the 3D paraboloid which fits the
arc detected in the 24 {\mu}m Spitzer image. Four other compact CO globulettes
are detected in the mapped area. These globulettes have a high density and
linewidth, and are strongly pressure-confined or transient. The good spatial
correlation between the CO globulettes and the IR arc suggests that they result
from the interaction of the radiation and wind emitted by HD 34078 with the
ambient gas. However, the details of this interaction remain unclear. A wind
mass loss rate significantly larger than the value inferred from UV lines is
favored by the large IR arc size, but does not easily explain the low velocity
of the CO globulettes. The effect of radiation pressure on dust grains also
meets several issues in explaining the observations. Further observational and
theoretical work is needed to fully elucidate the processes shaping the gas and
dust in bow shocks around runaway O stars. (Abridged)

Genetic Algorithms in combining building blocks of good solutions? Although
this has been discussed controversially for decades, we are still lacking a
rigorous and intuitive answer. We provide such answers for royal road functions
and OneMax, where every bit is a building block. For the latter we show that
using crossover makes every ($\mu$+$\lambda$) Genetic Algorithm at least twice
as fast as the fastest evolutionary algorithm using only standard bit mutation,
up to small-order terms and for moderate $\mu$ and $\lambda$. Crossover is
beneficial because it effectively turns fitness-neutral mutations into
improvements by combining the right building blocks at a later stage. Compared
to mutation-based evolutionary algorithms, this makes multi-bit mutations more
useful. Introducing crossover changes the optimal mutation rate on OneMax from
$1/n$ to $(1+\sqrt{5})/2 \cdot 1/n \approx 1.618/n$. This holds both for
uniform crossover and $k$-point crossover. Experiments and statistical tests
confirm that our findings apply to a broad class of building-block functions.

emission from bremsstrahlung or circumbinary dust, with either mechanism
facilitated by the mass outflows (e.g., disk wind/corona, accretion stream
overflow, and so on) present in novalikes. Our comparison of the relative
advantages and disadvantages of either mechanism for explaining the
observations suggests that the situation is rather ambiguous, largely
circumstantial, and in need of stricter observational constraints.

runtime library since version 7 - features intriguing asymmetries in its
behavior. They were shown to cause a basic variant of this algorithm to use
less comparisons than classic single-pivot Quicksort implementations. In this
paper, we extend the analysis to the case where the two pivots are chosen as
fixed order statistics of a random sample and give the precise leading term of
the average number of comparisons, swaps and executed Java Bytecode
instructions. It turns out that - unlike for classic Quicksort, where it is
optimal to choose the pivot as median of the sample - the asymmetries in
Yaroslavskiy's algorithm render pivots with a systematic skew more efficient
than the symmetric choice. Moreover, the optimal skew heavily depends on the
employed cost measure; most strikingly, abstract costs like the number of swaps
and comparisons yield a very different result than counting Java Bytecode
instructions, which can be assumed most closely related to actual running time.

approximately 22 years, although the amplitude of the cycle is subject to
long-term modulation with recurrent phases of significantly reduced magnetic
activity. It is believed that a hydromagnetic dynamo is responsible for
producing this large-scale field, although this dynamo process is not well
understood.
  Within the framework of mean-field dynamo theory, our aim is to investigate
how competing mechanisms for poloidal field regeneration (namely a time delayed
Babcock-Leighton surface alpha-effect and an interface-type alpha-effect), can
lead to the modulation of magnetic activity in a deep-seated solar dynamo
model.
  We solve the standard alpha-omega dynamo equations in one spatial dimension,
including source terms corresponding to both of the the competing alpha-effects
in the evolution equation for the poloidal field. This system is solved using
two different methods. In addition to solving the one-dimensional partial
differential equations directly, using numerical techniques, we also use a
local approximation to reduce the governing equations to a set of coupled
ordinary differential equations (ODEs), which are studied using a combination
of analytical and numerical methods.
  In the ODE model, it is straightforward to find parameters such that a series
of bifurcations can be identified as the time delay is increased, with the
dynamo transitioning from periodic states to chaotic states via multiply
periodic solutions. Similar transitions can be observed in the full model, with
the chaotically modulated solutions exhibiting solar-like behaviour.

parameterization} (QCMC) for a multiply-connected 2D domain or surface. QCMC
computes a quasi-conformal map from a multiply-connected domain $S$ onto a
punctured disk $D_S$ associated with a given Beltrami differential. The
Beltrami differential, which measures the conformality distortion, is a
complex-valued function $\mu:S\to\mathbb{C}$ with supremum norm strictly less
than 1. Every Beltrami differential gives a conformal structure of $S$. Hence,
the conformal module of $D_S$, which are the radii and centers of the inner
circles, can be fully determined by $\mu$, up to a M\""obius transformation. In
this paper, we propose an iterative algorithm to simultaneously search for the
conformal module and the optimal quasi-conformal parameterization. The key idea
is to minimize the Beltrami energy subject to the boundary constraints. The
optimal solution is our desired quasi-conformal parameterization onto a
punctured disk. The parameterization of the multiply-connected domain
simplifies numerical computations and has important applications in various
fields, such as in computer graphics and vision. Experiments have been carried
out on synthetic data together with real multiply-connected Riemann surfaces.
Results show that our proposed method can efficiently compute quasi-conformal
parameterizations of multiply-connected domains and outperforms other
state-of-the-art algorithms. Applications of the proposed parameterization
technique have also been explored.

  modification of the Bayesian information criterion",,,"10.1371/journal.pone.0103322",,"stat.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The prevailing method of analyzing GWAS data is still to test each marker
individually, although from a statistical point of view it is quite obvious
that in case of complex traits such single marker tests are not ideal. Recently
several model selection approaches for GWAS have been suggested, most of them
based on LASSO-type procedures. Here we will discuss an alternative model
selection approach which is based on a modification of the Bayesian Information
Criterion (mBIC2) which was previously shown to have certain asymptotic
optimality properties in terms of minimizing the misclassification error.
Heuristic search strategies are introduced which attempt to find the model
which minimizes mBIC2, and which are efficient enough to allow the analysis of
GWAS data.
  Our approach is implemented in a software package called MOSGWA. Its
performance in case control GWAS is compared with the two algorithms HLASSO and
GWASelect, as well as with single marker tests, where we performed a simulation
study based on real SNP data from the POPRES sample. Our results show that
MOSGWA performs slightly better than HLASSO, whereas according to our
simulations GWASelect does not control the type I error when used to
automatically determine the number of important SNPs. We also reanalyze the
GWAS data from the Wellcome Trust Case-Control Consortium (WTCCC) and compare
the findings of the different procedures.

to encrypt images, in which the generation of shuffling sequences are
independent to the plain-image/cipher-image. As a result, it fails to the
chosen-plaintext and known-plaintext attacks. Moreover, the statistical
features of the cryptosystem are not up to the standard. Therefore, the
security improvements are framed to make the above attacks infeasible and
enhance the statistical features as well. It is achieved by modifying the
pixel-chaotic-shuffle mechanism and adding a new pixel-chaotic-diffusion
mechanism to it. The keys for diffusion of pixels are extracted from the same
chaotic sequences generated in the previous stage. The simulation analyses and
studies are performed to demonstrate that the updated version of cryptosystem
has better statistical features and resistant to the chosen-plaintext and
known-plaintext attacks than the existing algorithm.

Kuiper belt objects (KBOs) of our Solar System. The dynamics of the Kuiper belt

been done with $N$ up to $131,062$, setting the KBOs on initially nearly
circular orbits distributed in a ring of surface density $\Sigma \sim r^{-2}$.
This modelization allowed us to investigate the secular evolution of the KB
upon the encounter with the perturbing star. Actually, the encounter itself
usually leads toward eccentricity and inclination distributions similar to
observed ones, but tends also to excite the low-eccentricity population ($e <
0.1$ around $a\sim 40$\,$\mathrm{AU}$ from the Sun), depleting this region of
low eccentricities. The following long-term evolution shows a ""cooling"" of the
eccentricities repopulating the low-eccentricity area. In dependence on the
assumed KBO mass spectrum and sampled number of bodies, this repopulation takes
place in a time that goes from 0.5 Myr to 100 Myr. Due to the unavoidable
limitation in the number of objects in our long-term simulations ($N \leq
16384$), we could not consider a detailed KBO mass spectrum, accounting for low
mass objects, thus our present simulations are not reliable in constraining
correlations among inclination distribution of the KBOs and other properties,
such as their size distribution. However, our high precision long term
simulations are a starting point for future larger studies on massively
parallel computational platforms which will provide a deeper investigation of

of energy dissipation the formalism becomes more manageable and transparent
than in the conventional setting where uniform sliding motion is assumed from
$t=-\infty$ to $t=+\infty$. One avoids separating off a reversible
interparticle force (independent of friction) from the total force. Moreover,
the cases of temperatures $T=0$ and finite $T$ are treated on the same footing.

223 gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) detected by the InterPlanetary Network (IPN) in
2005-2010 during LIGO's fifth and sixth science runs and Virgo's first, second
and third science runs. The IPN satellites provide accurate times of the bursts
and sky localizations that vary significantly from degree scale to hundreds of
square degrees. We search for both a well-modeled binary coalescence signal,
the favored progenitor model for short GRBs, and for generic, unmodeled
gravitational wave bursts. Both searches use the event time and sky
localization to improve the gravitational-wave search sensitivity as compared
to corresponding all-time, all-sky searches. We find no evidence of a
gravitational-wave signal associated with any of the IPN GRBs in the sample,
nor do we find evidence for a population of weak gravitational-wave signals
associated with the GRBs. For all IPN-detected GRBs, for which a sufficient
duration of quality gravitational-wave data is available, we place lower bounds
on the distance to the source in accordance with an optimistic assumption of
gravitational-wave emission energy of $10^{-2}M_{\odot}c^2$ at 150 Hz, and find
a median of 13 Mpc. For the 27 short-hard GRBs we place 90% confidence
exclusion distances to two source models: a binary neutron star coalescence,
with a median distance of 12Mpc, or the coalescence of a neutron star and black
hole, with a median distance of 22 Mpc. Finally, we combine this search with
previously published results to provide a population statement for GRB searches
in first-generation LIGO and Virgo gravitational-wave detectors, and a
resulting examination of prospects for the advanced gravitational-wave
detectors.

not provide high-level network abstractions (address pools, VPN maps, etc.),

interpolating from multiple circles to the vacuum. They are constructed from
SO(4,2) invariant linear maps from the tensor product of the state spaces to
complex numbers. When appropriate states labeled by 4D-spacetime coordinates
are inserted at the circles, the TFT2 amplitudes become correlators of the
four-dimensional CFT4. The TFT2 structure includes an associative algebra,
related to crossing in the 4D-CFT, with a non-degenerate pairing related to the
CFT inner product in the CFT4. In the free-field case, the TFT2/CFT4

theory as a categorified form of classical invariant theory for appropriate

metal-organic frameworks (MOFs). The compounds
[C(NH$_{2}$)$_{3}$]M(HCOO)$_{3}$, where M=Cu$^{2+}$ or Cr$^{2+}$ are
Jahn-Teller (JT) active ions, are MOF with perovskite topology which
crystallizes in polar space group Pna2$_{1}$. In inorganic compounds,
octahedral tilting and Jahn-Teller structural distortions are usually non-polar
distortions. However, in this MOF cooperative interactions between the
antiferro-distortive distortions of the framework and the C(NH2)$_{3}$ organic
cation via hydrogen bonding breaks the inversion symmetry and induces a
ferroelectric polarization.[Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 50, 5847, 2011] Our ab-initio
study supports the picture of an orbital-order-induced ferroelectricity, a rare
example of dipolar ordering caused by electronic degrees of freedom. The
switching of polarization direction implies the reversal of the weak
ferromagnetic component. The microscopic mechanism in this JT-based MOF with
ABX$_{3}$ perovskite structure displays a Hybrid Improper Ferroelectric (HIF)
state, arising from a trilinear coupling between different structural
deformations that comprise tilting, rotations and Jahn-Teller distortions of
both the BX$_{3}$ framework and the organic cation at the A sites. Since these
distortion modes in perovskite-inorganic compounds usually freeze-in at
elevated temperatures, the trilinear coupling in MOF compounds may provide an
interesting route towards high-temperature multiferroicity. These results offer
an important starting point for tailoring multiferroic properties in this
emerging class of materials for various technological applications. In
particular, the high tunability of the ferroelectric polarization by means of
the modification of the organic A cation has been recently shown[J. Am. Chem.

invoking the scalar-tensor representation. We derive the stress-energy tensor
of the quantum anomaly in the flat homogeneous and isotropic universe. We
investigate a suitable toy model of exponential gravity plus the quantum
contribution due to the conformal anomaly, which leads to the de Sitter
solution. It is shown that in $F(R)$ gravity model, the curvature perturbations
with its enough amplitude consistent with the observations are generated during
inflation. We also evaluate the number of $e$-folds at the inflationary stage
and the spectral index $n_\mathrm{s}$ of scalar modes of the curvature
perturbations by analogy with scalar tensor theories, and compare them with the
observational data. As a result, it is found that the Ricci scalar decreases
during inflation and the standard evolution history of the universe is
recovered at the small curvature regime. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that
in our model, the tensor-to-scalar ratio of the curvature perturbations can be
a finite value within the $68\%\,\mathrm{CL}$ error of the very recent result
found by the BICEP2 experiment.

being dominated by low multipoles $l \lesssim 50$ and no preference for running
at higher $l$. A negative spectral index is also necessary for the 2-$\sigma$
Planck upper bound on the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ to be consistent with
values significantly larger than 0.1. Planck has also observed a hemispherical
asymmetry of the CMB power spectrum, again mostly at low multipoles. Here we
consider whether the physics responsible for the hemispherical asymmetry could
also account for the negative running of the spectral index and the consistency
of Planck with a large value of $r$. A negative running of the spectral index
can be generated if the hemispherical asymmetry is due to a scale- and
space-dependent modulation which suppresses the CMB power spectrum at low
multipoles. We show that the observed hemispherical asymmetry at low $l$ can be
generated while satisfying constraints on the asymmetry at higher $l$ and
generating a negative spectral index of the right magnitude to account for the
Planck observation and to allow Planck to be consistent with a large value of
$r$.

DeepWalk generalizes recent advancements in language modeling and unsupervised
feature learning (or deep learning) from sequences of words to graphs. DeepWalk
uses local information obtained from truncated random walks to learn latent
representations by treating walks as the equivalent of sentences. We
demonstrate DeepWalk's latent representations on several multi-label network
classification tasks for social networks such as BlogCatalog, Flickr, and
YouTube. Our results show that DeepWalk outperforms challenging baselines which
are allowed a global view of the network, especially in the presence of missing
information. DeepWalk's representations can provide $F_1$ scores up to 10%
higher than competing methods when labeled data is sparse. In some experiments,
DeepWalk's representations are able to outperform all baseline methods while
using 60% less training data. DeepWalk is also scalable. It is an online
learning algorithm which builds useful incremental results, and is trivially
parallelizable. These qualities make it suitable for a broad class of real
world applications such as network classification, and anomaly detection.

luminosity/mass of the Milky Way Nuclear Star Cluster (MWNSC). We use
Spitzer/IRAC images at 3.6 and 4.5 micrometer, where interstellar extinction is
at a minimum but the overall emission is still dominated by stars. We correct
the 4.5 micrometer image for PAH emission with the help of the IRAC 8.0
micrometer map and for extinction with the help of a [3.6-4.5] colour map. We
present an extinction map for the central ~300x200 pc^2 of the Milky Way, as
well as a PAH-emission and extinction corrected image of the stellar emission,
with a resolution of about 0.2 pc. We find that the MWNSC appears in projection
intrinsically point-symmetric, that it is significantly flattened, with its
major axis aligned along the Galactic Plane, and that it is centred on the
black hole, Sagittarius A*. Its density follows the well known approximate
rho~r^{-2}-law at distances of a few parsecs from Sagittarius A*, but may
become as steep as rho~r^{-3} at projected radii around 5 pc. We derive a half
light radius of 4.2+-0.4 pc, a total luminosity of L_MWNSC=(4.1+-0.4)x10^{7}
L_Sun, and a mass of M_{MWNSC}=(2.5+-0.4)x10^{7} M_Sun. The overall properties
of the MWNSC agree well with the ones of its extragalactic counterparts, which
underlines its role as a template for these objects. Its flattening agrees well
with its previously established rotation parallel to Galactic rotation and
suggests that it has formed by accretion of material that fell in
preferentially along the Galactic Plane. Our findings support the in situ
growth scenario for nuclear clusters and emphasize the need to increase the
complexity of theoretical models for their formation and for the interaction
between their stars and the central black hole in order to include rotation,
axisymmetry, and growth in recurrent episodes.

is expected to be robust against breakdown. Gains as high as 2.6x10^4 were
achieved with PTFE-GEM (50 um thick) in Ar/CO2 = 70%/30% gas mixture at V_GEM =

the limb and near limb spicules (ondisk spicules that historically were called
dark or bright mottles especially when observed in Halpha rather cool line)
from the dynamical behavior (e.g., periodicity). An excellent time sequence of
images obtained near the equatorial region with a cadence of 8 s was selected
for analysis. 1D Fourier power spectra made at different positions on the disk
and above the limb are shown. We take advantage of the so-called madmax
operator to reduce effects of overlapping and improve the visibility of these
hair like features. A definite signature with strong power in the 3 min. (5.5
mHz) and 5 min. (3.5 mHz) oscillations for both places exist. A full range of
oscillations was found and the high frequency intensity fluctuation (greater
than 10 mHz or less than 100 sec.) corresponding to the occurrence of the so-
called type II spicules and, even more impressively, dominant peaks of Fourier
power spectra are seen in a wide range of frequencies and for all places of on
and off disk spicules, in rough agreement with what historical works were
reporting regarding the disk mottles and limb spicules. Also, some
statistically significant behavior, based on power spectrum computed for
different positions, is discussed. The power for all kind of power spectra are
decreasing with the increasing distance from the limb, except for photospheric
oscillations (5 min. or p mode), which show a dominate peak for on disk power
spectra.

relevance. Neurons transmit information about their inputs by transforming them
into spike trains, and the timing of these spike trains is in turn crucial for
effectively encoding that information. Random processes and uncertainty that
underly neuronal dynamics have been shown to prolong the time towards the first
response in a phenomenon dubbed noise-delayed decay. Here we study whether
Hodgkin-Huxley neurons with a tunable intensity of intrinsic noise might have
shorter response times to external stimuli just above threshold if placed on a
scale-free network. We show that the heterogeneity of the interaction network
may indeed eradicate slow responsiveness, but only if the coupling between
individual neurons is sufficiently strong. Increasing the average degree also
favors a fast response, but it is less effective than increasing the coupling
strength. We also show that noise-delayed decay can be offset further by
adjusting the frequency of the external signal, as well as by blocking a
fraction of voltage-gated sodium or potassium ion channels. For certain
conditions, we observe a double peak in the response time depending on the
intensity of intrinsic noise, indicating competition between local and global
effects on the neuronal dynamics.

clear evidence for the presence of clouds in its atmosphere, which
significantly increases the model atmosphere parameter space that must be
explored in order to fully characterise this planet. In this work, we apply the
NEMESIS atmospheric retrieval code to the recently published HST/STIS
reflection spectrum, and also to the dayside thermal emission spectrum in the
light of new Spitzer/IRAC measurements, as well as our own re-analysis of the
HST/NICMOS data. We first use the STIS data to place some constraints on the
nature of the cloud on HD189733b, and explore solution degeneracy between
different cloud properties and the abundance of Na in the atmosphere; as
already noted in previous work, absorption due to Na plays a significant role
in determining the shape of the reflection spectrum. We then perform a new
retrieval of the temperature profile and abundances of H2O, CO2, CO and CH4
from the dayside thermal emission spectrum. Finally, we investigate the effect
of including cloud in the model on this retrieval process. We find that the
current quality of data does not warrant the extra complexity introduced by
including cloud in the model; however, future data are likely to be of
sufficient resolution and signal-to-noise that a more complete model, including

adaptive optics (MCAO) systems in order to obtain high angular resolution over

Existing solar MCAO systems rely exclusively on the star-oriented approach.
Earlier we have suggested a method to implement the layer-oriented approach,
and in view of recent concerns we now explain the proposed scheme in further
detail. We note that in any layer-oriented system one sensor is conjugated to
the pupil and the others are conjugated to higher altitudes. For the latter not
all the sensing surface is illuminated by the entire field-of-view. The
successful implementation of nighttime layer-oriented systems shows that the
field reduction is no crucial limitation. In the solar approach the
field-reduction is directly noticeable because it causes vignetting of the
Shack-Hartmann sub-aperture images. It can be accounted for by a suitable
adjustment of the algorithms to calculate the local wave-front slopes. We
dispel a further concern related to the optical layout of a layer-oriented
solar system.

is often associated with unresolved cores. In this paper we show that most
LLAGN present extended jet radio emission when observed with sufficient angular
resolution and sensitivity. They are thus able to power, at least, parsec-scale
radio jets. To increase the detection rate of jets in LLAGN, we analyze
subarcsecond resolution data of three low-ionization nuclear emission regions.
This yields the detection of extended jet-like radio structures in NGC\,1097
and NGC\,2911 and the first resolved parsec-scale jet of NGC\,4594 (Sombrero).
The three sources belong to a sample of nearby LLAGN for which
high-spatial-resolution spectral energy distribution of their core emission is
available. This allows us to study their accretion rate and jet power
($Q_\mathrm{jet}$) without drawing on (most) of the ad hoc assumptions usually
considered in large statistical surveys. We find that those LLAGN with
large-scale radio jets ($>$100 pc) have $Q_\mathrm{jet} > 10^{42}$ erg
s$^{-1}$, while the lowest $Q_\mathrm{jet}$ correspond to those LLAGN with
parsec-scale ($\leq$100 pc) jets. The $Q_\mathrm{jet}$ is at least as large as
the radiated bolometric luminosity for all LLAGN, in agreement with previous
statistical studies. Our detection of parsec-scale jets in individual objects
further shows that the kinematic jet contribution is equally important in
large- or parsec-scale objects. We also find that the Eddington-scaled
accretion rate is still highly sub-Eddington ($<10^{-4}$) when adding the
$Q_\mathrm{jet}$ to the total emitted luminosity (radiated plus kinetic). This
indicates that LLAGN are not only inefficient radiators but that they also
accrete inefficiently or are very efficient advectors.

of the electron prior to recombination is approximately equal to the lifetime

non-equilibrium free energy considerably differs from the equilibrium one. The
efficiency of the separation process decreases with increasing the distance to

memory would have on primordial black holes, within the theoretical context of
$F(R)$ related scalar-tensor theories. As we will demonstrate, under the
assumption that the initial mass of the primordial black hole is such so that
it evaporates today, this can potentially constrain the $F(R)$ related theories
of gravity. We study two scalar-tensor models and discuss the evolution of
primordial black holes created at some initial time $t_f$ in the early
universe. The results between the two models vary significantly which shows us
that, if the effect of gravitational memory is considered valid, some of the
scalar-tensor models and their corresponding $F(R)$ theories must be further
constrained.

Rev. B 84, 201308(R) (2011), an isolated Majorana
state bound to one edge of a long enough Kitaev chain in the topological phase
and connected to a quantum dot, results in a robust transmittance of $1/2$ at
zero-bias. In this work, we show that the removal of such a hallmark can be
achieved by using a metallic surface hosting two adatoms in a scenario where
there is a lack of symmetry in the Fano effect, which is feasible by coupling
the Kitaev chain to one of these adatoms. Thus in order to detect this feature
experimentally, one should apply the following two-stage procedure: (i) first,
attached to the adatoms, one has to lock AFM tips in opposite gate voltages
(symmetric detuning of the levels) and measure by an STM tip, the zero-bias
conductance; (ii) thereafter, the measurement of the conductance is repeated
with the gates swapped. For the absolute value of the detuning away from the
Fermi energy and in the case of strong coupling tip-host, this approach reveals
in the transmittance, a persistent dip placed at zero-bias and immune to the
aforementioned permutation, but characterized by an amplitude that fluctuates
slightly around $1/2$. However, in the case of a tip acting as a probe, the
adatom decoupled from the Kitaev chain becomes completely inert and no
fluctuation is observed. Therefore, the STM tip must be considered in the same
footing as the ""host+adatoms"" system. As a result, we have found that despite
the small difference between these two Majorana dips, the zero-bias
transmittance as a function of the symmetric detuning yields two distinct
behaviors, in which one of them is unpredictable by the standard Fano's theory.
Therefore, to access such a non trivial pattern of Fano interference, the
hypothesis of the STM tip acting as a probe should be discarded.

predictions for the light elements using the cosmological parameters determined
by Planck, as well as an improvement of the nuclear network and new
spectroscopic observations. There is a slight lowering of the primordial Li/H
abundance, however, this lithium value still remains typically 3 times larger
than its observed spectroscopic abundance in halo stars of the Galaxy.
According to the importance of this ""lithium problem"", we trace the small
changes in its BBN calculated abundance following updates of the baryonic
density, neutron lifetime and networks. In addition, for the first time, we
provide confidence limits for the production of 6Li, 9Be, 11B and CNO,

A specific focus is cast on CNO primordial production. Considering
uncertainties on the nuclear rates around the CNO formation, we obtain CNO/H
\approx (5-30) x 10^{-15}. We further improve this estimate by analyzing
correlations between yields and reaction rates and identified new influential
reaction rates. These uncertain rates, if simultaneously varied could lead to a
significant increase of CNO production: CNO/H \sim 10^{-13}. This result is
important for the study of population III star formation during the dark ages.

interpretable models for complex high dimensional data. Sparse models have
found widespread use in structure discovery, recovering data from corruptions,
and a variety of large scale unsupervised and supervised learning problems.
Assuming the availability of sufficient data, these methods infer dictionaries
for sparse representations by optimizing for high-fidelity reconstruction. In
most scenarios, the reconstruction quality is measured using the squared
Euclidean distance, and efficient algorithms have been developed for both batch
and online learning cases. However, new application domains motivate looking
beyond conventional loss functions. For example, robust loss functions such as
$\ell_1$ and Huber are useful in learning outlier-resilient models, and the
quantile loss is beneficial in discovering structures that are the
representative of a particular quantile. These new applications motivate our
work in generalizing sparse learning to a broad class of convex loss functions.
In particular, we consider the class of piecewise linear quadratic (PLQ) cost
functions that includes Huber, as well as $\ell_1$, quantile, Vapnik, hinge
loss, and smoothed variants of these penalties. We propose an algorithm to
learn dictionaries and obtain sparse codes when the data reconstruction
fidelity is measured using any smooth PLQ cost function. We provide convergence
guarantees for the proposed algorithm, and demonstrate the convergence behavior
using empirical experiments. Furthermore, we present three case studies that
require the use of PLQ cost functions: (i) robust image modeling, (ii) tag
refinement for image annotation and retrieval and (iii) computing empirical

every linear program expressing the matching polytope has an exponential number
of inequalities (formally, the matching polytope has exponential extension
complexity). We generalize this result by deriving strong bounds on the
polyhedral inapproximability of the matching polytope: for fixed $0 <
\varepsilon < 1$, every polyhedral $(1 + \varepsilon / n)$-approximation
requires an exponential number of inequalities, where $n$ is the number of
vertices. This is sharp given the well-known $\rho$-approximation of size
$O(\binom{n}{\rho/(\rho-1)})$ provided by the odd-sets of size up to
$\rho/(\rho-1)$. Thus matching is the first problem in $P$, whose natural
linear encoding does not admit a fully polynomial-size relaxation scheme (the
polyhedral equivalent of an FPTAS), which provides a sharp separation from the
polynomial-size relaxation scheme obtained e.g., via constant-sized odd-sets
mentioned above.
  Our approach reuses ideas from Rothvo{\ss} [arxiv:1311.2369], however the
main lower bounding technique is different. While the original proof is based
on the hyperplane separation bound (also called the rectangle corruption
bound), we employ the information-theoretic notion of common information as
introduced in Braun and Pokutta [http://eccc.hpi-web.de/report/2013/056/],

high extension complexity for the matching polytope stem from the same source

of scalar field theory. In particular we concentrate on two maximally symmetric
spaces: $d$-dimensional spheres and hyperboloids. In the first part of the
paper, by applying the Ginzburg criterion, we find that for large correlation
length the Gaussian approximation is valid on the hyperboloid for any dimension
$d\geq 2$, while it is not trustable on the sphere for any dimension. This is
understood in terms of various notions of effective dimension, such as the
spectral and Hausdorff dimension. In the second part of the paper, we apply
functional renormalization group methods to develop a different perspective on
such phenomena, and to deduce them from a renormalization group analysis. By
making use of the local potential approximation, we discuss the consequences of
having a fixed scale in the renormalization group equations. In particular, we
show that in the case of spheres there is no true phase transition, as symmetry
restoration always occurs at large scales. In the case of hyperboloids, the
phase transition is still present, but as the only true fixed point is the
Gaussian one, mean field exponents are valid also in dimensions lower than
four.

recombining, and not in ionization equilibrium. But parameters such as the

The haloes are very extended, but faint in surface brightness - 10^3 times

extremely well studied main nebula, to model the processes in the shells and
haloes of one object. NGC2438 is a perfect candidate to explore the physical
characteristics of the halo. Long-slit spectroscopic data were obtained. These
data are supplemented by imaging data from the HST archive, and archival VLA
observations. The use of diagnostic diagrams draws limits for physical
properties in the models. CLOUDY is used to model the nebular properties, and
to derive a more accurate distance and ionized mass. We derive an accurate
extinction E(B-V)=0.16, and distance of 1.9kpc. This puts the nebula behind the
nearby open cluster M46. The low-excitation species are found to be dominated
by clumps. The emission line ratios show no evidence for shocks. We find the
shell in ionization equilibrium: a significant amount of UV radiation
infiltrates the inner nebula. Thus the shell still seems to be ionized. The
spatially resolved CLOUDY model supports the hypothesis that photoionization is
the dominant process in this nebula, far out into the shell. Previous models
predicted that the shell would be recombining, but this is not confirmed by the

approach to multi-penalty regularization in spaces of sparsely represented

geometrical/structured features of high-dimensional data, which may not be
well-represented in the framework of typically more isotropic Hilbert spaces.
In this paper, we are particularly interested in regularizers which are able to
correctly model and separate the multiple components of additively mixed
signals. This situation is rather common as pure signals may be corrupted by
additive noise. To this end, we consider a regularization functional composed
by a data-fidelity term, where signal and noise are additively mixed, a
non-smooth and non-convex sparsity promoting term, and a penalty term to model
the noise. We propose and analyze the convergence of an iterative alternating
algorithm based on simple iterative thresholding steps to perform the
minimization of the functional. By means of this algorithm, we explore the
effect of choosing different regularization parameters and penalization norms
in terms of the quality of recovering the pure signal and separating it from
additive noise. For a given fixed noise level numerical experiments confirm a
significant improvement in performance compared to standard one-parameter
regularization methods. By using high-dimensional data analysis methods such as
Principal Component Analysis, we are able to show the correct geometrical
clustering of regularized solutions around the expected solution. Eventually,
for the compressive sensing problems considered in our experiments we provide a
guideline for a choice of regularization norms and parameters.

vertically {unstratified} accretion disks incorporating thermal relaxation. We
find a linear amplification of epicyclic oscillations in these disks that
depends on the effective cooling time, i.e. an overstability. The growth rates
of the overstability vanish for both extreme cases, e.g. infinite cooling time
and instantaneous cooling, i.e. the adiabatic and fully isothermal cases.
However, for thermal relaxation times $\tau$ on the order of the orbital
frequency, $\tau\Omega \sim 1$, modes grow at a rate proportional to the square
of the Brunt-V\""ais\""al\""a frequency. The overstability is based on epicyclic
motions, with the thermal relaxation causing gas to heat while radially
displaced inwards, and cool while radially displaced outwards. This causes the
gas to have a lower density when moving outwards compared to when it moves
inwards, so it feels the outwards directed pressure force more strongly on that
leg of the journey. We suggest the term ``Convective Overstability"" for the
phenomenon that has already been numerically studied in the non-linear regime
in the context of amplifying vortices in disks, under the name ``Subcritical
Baroclinic Instability"". The point of the present paper is to make clear that
vortex formation in three-dimensional disks is neither subcritical, i.e. does
not need a finite perturbation, nor is it baroclinic in the sense of
geophysical fluid dynamics, which requires on vertical shear. We find that
Convective Overstability is a linear instability that will operate under a wide
range of physical conditions for circumstellar disks.

advanced. This technique compares the probability of the planetary hypothesis
against that of all reasonably conceivable alternative false-positive (FP)
hypotheses. The candidate is considered as validated if the posterior
probability of the planetary hypothesis is sufficiently larger than the sum of
the probabilities of all FP scenarios. In this paper, we present PASTIS, the

flexibility for defining the scenarios to be compared. The performance is
explored using artificial transit light curves of planets and FPs with a
realistic error distribution obtained from a Kepler light curve. We find that
data support for the correct hypothesis is strong only when the signal is high
enough (transit signal-to-noise ratio above 50 for the planet case) and remains
inconclusive otherwise. PLATO shall provide transits with high enough

bifurcation, SDA is manifested as a smooth wavy modulation of the amplitudes of
both repolarization and calcium transient (CaT) alternans, similarly to the
well-studied case of voltage-driven alternans. In contrast, further away from
the bifurcation, the amplitude of CaT alternans jumps discontinuously at the
nodes separating out-of-phase regions, while the amplitude of repolarization
alternans remains smooth. We show that node motion of discontinuous SDA
patterns is strongly hysteretic even in homogeneous tissue due to the novel
phenomenon of ""unidirectional pinning"": node movement can only be induced
towards, but not away from, the pacing site in response to a change of pacing
rate or physiological parameter. In addition, we show that the wavelength of
discontinuous SDA patterns scales linearly with the conduction velocity
restitution length scale, in contrast to the wavelength of smooth patterns that
scales sub-linearly with this length scale. Those results are also shown to be
robust against cell-to-cell fluctuations owing to the property that
unidirectional node motion collapses multiple jumps accumulating in nodal
regions into a single jump. Amplitude equation predictions are in good overall
agreement with ionic model simulations. Finally, we briefly discuss
physiological implications of our findings. In particular, we suggest that due
to the tendency of conduction blocks to form near nodes, the presence of
unidirectional pinning makes calcium-driven alternans potentially more

auctions or other bidding processes. However, there are also social, cultural,
and cognitive components to the assignation of value, which can be observed in
both human and non-human Primate societies. While behaviors related to these
factors are embedded in market interactions, they also involve a biological
substrate for the assignation of value (valuation). To synthesize this
diversity of perspectives, we will propose that the process of valuation can be
modeled computationally and conceived of as a set of interrelated cultural
evolutionary, cognitive, and neural processes. To do this, contextual geometric
structures (CGS) will be placed in an agent-based context (minimal and
compositional markets). Objects in the form of computational propositions can
be acquired and exchanged, which will determine the value of both singletons

translating between the dimensions. A negotiation protocol and a decision
algorithm are then used to let the parties agree on the security features used
in the service. This article demonstrates the feasibility and usability of the
mechanism by describing its usage scenario and proof-of-concept implementation
and analyzes its nonrepudiability and security aspects.

  class-imbalanced problems","7 pages, 5 figures, 3 Tables",,,,"cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This work investigates into cost behaviors of binary classification measures
in a background of class-imbalanced problems. Twelve performance measures are
studied, such as F measure, G-means in terms of accuracy rates, and of recall
and precision, balance error rate (BER), Matthews correlation coefficient
(MCC), Kappa coefficient, etc. A new perspective is presented for those
measures by revealing their cost functions with respect to the class imbalance
ratio. Basically, they are described by four types of cost functions. The
functions provides a theoretical understanding why some measures are suitable
for dealing with class-imbalanced problems. Based on their cost functions, we
are able to conclude that G-means of accuracy rates and BER are suitable
measures because they show ""proper"" cost behaviors in terms of ""a
misclassification from a small class will cause a greater cost than that from a
large class"". On the contrary, F1 measure, G-means of recall and precision, MCC
and Kappa coefficient measures do not produce such behaviors so that they are
unsuitable to serve our goal in dealing with the problems properly.

  antiretroviral therapy: Cautions, caveats and the importance of parsimony","Two pages. One figure embedded in text",,,,"q-bio.QM","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In a recent article Hontelez and colleagues investigate the prospects for
elimination of HIV in South Africa through expanded access to antiretroviral
therapy (ART) using STDSIM, a micro-simulation model. One of the first
published models to suggest that expanded access to ART could lead to the
elimination of HIV, referred to by the authors as the Granich Model, was
developed and implemented by the present author. The notion that expanded
access to ART could lead to the end of the AIDS epidemic gave rise to
considerable interest and debate and remains contentious. In considering this
notion Hontelez et al. start by stripping down STDSIM to a simple model that is
equivalent to the model developed by the present author3 but is a stochastic
event driven model. Hontelez and colleagues then reintroduce levels of
complexity to explore ways in which the model structure affects the results. In
contrast to our earlier conclusions Hontelez and colleagues conclude that
universal voluntary counselling and testing with immediate ART at 90% coverage
should result in the elimination of HIV but would take three times longer than
predicted by the model developed by the present author. Hontelez et al. suggest
that the current scale-up of ART at CD4 cell counts less than 350 cells/microL
will lead to elimination of HIV in 30 years. I disagree with both claims and
believe that their more complex models rely on unwarranted and unsubstantiated
assumptions.

synchronization method based on dual slave clocks, where they claim that
multiple unknown parameters --- i.e., clock offset, clock skew, and
master-to-slave delay --- can be estimated with only one-way time transfers
using more equations than usual. This comment investigates Chin and Chen's dual
clock scheme with detailed models for a master and dual slave clocks and shows
that the formulation of multi-parameter estimation is invalid, which affirms
that it is impossible to distinguish the effect of delay from that of clock
offset at a slave even with dual slave clocks.

This
form factor enables new usage possibilities, such as hands-free video chats and
instant web search. However, its shape also hampers its potential: (1) battery
size, and therefore lifetime, is limited by a need for the device to be
lightweight, and (2) high-power processing leads to significant heat, which
should be limited, due to the Glass' compact form factor and close proximity to
the user's skin. We use the Glass in a case study of the power and thermal
characteristics of optical head-mounted display devices. We share insights and
implications to limit power consumption to increase the safety and utility of
head-mounted devices.
