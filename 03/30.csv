decay mechanisms responsible for the fine structure. The level density of 1-

structure of the IVGDR in contrast to the isoscalar giant quadrupole resonance,
where fine structure arises from the coupling to low-lying surface vibrations.

diversity of activity in the neighborhood, the nearby area sociability, as well
as the probability of customer flows from and to event places such as stadiums
and parks are all vital factors. Through supervised learning techniques we
demonstrate that the success of businesses hinges on a combination of both
geographic and mobility factors. Our results suggest that location-based social
networks, where crowdsourced information about the dynamic interaction of users

put forward several hypotheses on the motivating factors of user participation

accounting for whether friends are attending dominates the factors, the
popularity of an event proves to also be a strong attractor. Further, we
capture an implicit social signal by performing random walks in a high

proves especially suited to identify relevant niche events for users. Our
findings on the extent to which the various temporal, spatial and social

times that of the PSF, with log-normal scatter. I also drew fluxes from a
log-normal distribution. I produced independent simulations, each with pixel
noise tuned to produce different mean S/N ranging from 10-1000. I applied a
constant shear to all images. I fit the simulated images to a model with the
true Sersic index to avoid modeling biases. I recovered the input shear with

  A substantial part of the paper is devoted to the coarse geometry of these

Morse quasigeodesics in higher rank symmetric spaces, generalizing the Morse
property for quasigeodesics in Gromov hyperbolic spaces. It leads to the notion
of Morse actions of word hyperbolic groups on symmetric spaces,i.e. actions for
which the orbit maps are Morse quasiisometric embeddings, and thus provides a
coarse geometric characterization for the class of subgroups considered in this

recognizability of Morse actions and construct Morse ""Schottky subgroups'' of

identification of related networks and samples. Such models may improve the
accuracy of biological sample classification based on patterns of protein
network activation and provide insight into the distinct biological

propose a Bayesian sparse graphical modeling approach that uses selection
priors on the conditional relationships in the presence of class information.
The novelty of our Bayesian model lies in the ability to draw information from
the network data as well as from the associated categorical outcome in a
unified hierarchical model for classification. In addition, our method allows
for intuitive integration of a priori network information directly in the model
and allows for posterior inference on the network topologies both within and
between classes. Applying our methodology to an RPPA data set generated from
panels of human breast cancer and ovarian cancer cell lines, we demonstrate
that the model is able to distinguish the different cancer cell types more
accurately than several existing models and to identify differential regulation
of components of a critical signaling network (the PI3K-AKT pathway) between
these two types of cancer. This approach represents a powerful new tool that
can be used to improve our understanding of protein networks in cancer.

then tries to decode the transmitted signal based on the forwarded information
from the receive nodes and possible channel state information. We show that
there is a strong connection between the problem of minimizing a symbol error
probability at the fusion center in distributed reception and channel coding in
coding theory. This connection allows us to design a unified framework for
coded distributed diversity reception. We focus linear block codes such as
simplex codes or first-order Reed-Muller codes that achieve the Griesmer bound
with equality to maximize the diversity gain. Due to its simple structure, no
complex offline optimization process is needed to design the coding structure
at the receive nodes for the proposed coded diversity technique. The proposed
technique can support a wide array of distributed reception scenarios, i.e.,
arbitrary $M$-ary symbol transmission at the transmitter and received signal

pseudoscalar ``axion-like'' field. The thermalising processes in this model are
(right-handed) Majorana neutrino-antineutrino oscillations, which are induced
in the presence of the KR axion background. These processes freeze out at a
(high) temperature $T_c >> m$, where $m$ is the Majorana neutrino mass, at
which the KR background goes to zero or is diminished significantly, through
appropriate phase transitions of the (string) universe. An additional, but
equally important, r\^ole, of the KR field is that its quantum fluctuations and
mixing with an ordinary axion, which couples to the Majorana neutrinos via
appropriate Yukawa couplings, can also lead to the generation of a Majorana
neutrino mass through quantum anomalies. This provides a novel way for
generating neutrino masses, independent of the traditional seesaw mechanism.

2013. Several new models of computation have emerged in the last years, and
many developments of traditional computational models have been proposed with
the aim of taking into account the new demands of computer systems users and
the new capabilities of computation engines. A new computational model, or a
new feature in a traditional one, usually is reflected in a new family of
programming languages, and new paradigms of software development. The aim of
this workshop is to bring together researchers who are currently developing new
computational models or new features for traditional computational models, in
order to foster their interaction, to provide a forum for presenting new ideas
and work in progress, and to enable newcomers to learn about current activities
in this area.

to any physical level from molecules and atoms to the level of macroscopic
extensional world, which leads to a main foundational problem in quantum theory
referred to as the ""measurement problem"", actually has a computational
character: It implies that there is a generic algorithm, which guarantees exact
solutions to the Schrodinger equation for every physical system in a reasonable
amount of time regardless of how many constituent microscopic particles it
comprises. From the point of view of computational complexity theory, this
requirement is equivalent to the assumption that the computational complexity
classes P and NP are equal, which is widely believed to be very unlikely. As
demonstrated in the paper, accepting the different computational assumption
called the Exponential Time Hypothesis (that involves P!=NP) would justify the
separation between a microscopic quantum system and a macroscopic apparatus
(usually called the Heisenberg cut) since this hypothesis, if true, would imply
that deterministic quantum and classical descriptions are impossible to overlap
in order to obtain a rigorous derivation of complete properties of macroscopic
objects from their microstates.

properties of the Lya emission (spectral profile, spatial distribution,
relation to Balmer lines intensity,...) in several local starburst galaxies. We
present here the results obtained for IRAS 08339+6517.
  Using evolutionary population synthesis models, we have characterized the
properties of the starburst (UV continuum, Halpha, total infrared and X-ray
emissions, etc.), which transformed 1.4e+8 Mo of gas into stars around 5-6 Myr
ago. In addition to the central compact emission blob, we have identified a
diffuse Lya emission component smoothly distributed over the whole central area
of IRAS 08339+6517. This diffuse emission is spatially decoupled from the UV
continuum, the Halpha emission or the Halpha/Hbeta ratio. Both locally and
globally, the Lya/Halpha ratio is lower than the Case B predictions, even after
reddening correction, with an overall Lya escape fraction of only 4%.
  We conclude that in IRAS 08339+6517 the resonant scattering of Lya photons by
an outflowing shell of neutral gas causes their highly-efficient destruction by
dust, which explains the low Lya escape fraction measured. These results stress
again the importance of a proper correction of scattering and transfer effects
when using Lya to derive the star formation rate in high-redshift galaxies.

of model runs is propagated forward in time and snapshots of the state are
stored. Next, a sequence of basis vectors is built and a low-dimensional
representation of the data assimilation system is obtained by projecting the
model state onto the space spanned by the ensemble deviations from the mean.
Finally, the low-dimensional optimization problem is solved in the
reduced-space using a trust region approach; the size of the trust region is
updated according to the relative decrease of the reduced order surrogate cost
function. The analysis state is projected back onto the full space, and the
process is repeated with the current analysis serving as a new background. A
heuristic approach based on the trust region size is proposed in order to
adjust the background error statistics from one iteration to the next.
Experimental simulations are carried out using the Lorenz and the

the joint distribution of the polynomials applied to the linear forms. We prove
a near-equidistribution theorem that describes these distributions for the
group $\mathbb{F}_p^n$ when $p$ is a fixed prime. This fundamental fact is
equivalent to a strong near-orthogonality statement regarding the higher-order
characters, and was previously known only under various extra assumptions about
the linear forms.
  As an application of our near-equidistribution theorem, we settle a
conjecture of Gowers and Wolf on the true complexity of systems of linear forms
for the group $\mathbb{F}_p^n$.

dynamics of a quantum dot modelled as a cascade three-level system. We show
that the phonon bath appears to the upper transition of the cascade system as a
broadband reservoir of inverted rather than conventional harmonic oscillators.
The action of the annihilation and creation operators of the inverted
oscillator are interchanges relative to those of the usual harmonic oscillator
that it serves as a linear amplifier to the system, and thereby gives rise to
unusual features in the dynamics of the quantum dot. We find that the phonon
bath, although being in a thermal state, affects the quantum dot as a
correlated-type reservoir which results in the decay of the system to a
correlated two-photon state with the population distribution no longer obeying
a Boltzmann distribution. It is particularly interesting that even for a zero
temperature phonon reservoir the steady state is a correlated state which under
appropriate conditions on the Rabi frequencies and the damping rates can reduce
to a strongly correlated pure state. It is shown that the two-photon
correlations result in a significant squeezing and strong two-photon
correlations in the radiation field emitted by the quantum dot. The presence of
the correlations in the system is manifest in the presence of quantum beats in
the time evolution of the populations and the radiation intensity. The effect
of the ordinary spontaneous emission on the features induced by the phonon bath
is also discussed.

observations of successive winking filaments in one event have not been
reported yet. In this paper, we present the observations of a chain of winking
filaments and a subsequent jet that are observed right after the X2.1 are in
AR11283. The event also produced an Extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) wave that has two
components: upward dome-like wave (850 km/s) and lateral surface wave (554
km/s) which was very weak (or invisible) in imaging observations. By analyzing
the temporal and spatial relationships between the oscillating filaments and
the EUV waves, we propose that all the winking filaments and the jet were
triggered by the weak (or invisible) lateral surface EUV wave. The oscillation
of the filaments last for two or three cycles, and their periods, Doppler
velocity amplitudes, and damping times are 11 - 22 minutes, 6 - 14 km/s, and 25
- 60 minutes, respectively. We further estimate the radial component magnetic
field and the maximum kinetic energy of the filaments, and they are 5 - 10
Gauss and ~ 10^19 J, respectively. The estimated maximum kinetic energy is
comparable to the minimum energy of ordinary EUV waves, suggesting that EUV
waves can efficiently launch filament oscillations on their path. Based on our
analysis results, we conclude that the EUV wave is a good agent for triggering
and connecting successive but separated solar activities in the solar
atmosphere, and it is also important for producing solar sympathetic eruptions.

properties of multiple filaments under force are very distinct from the
properties of a single filament under similar conditions -- these distinctions
manifest as follows: (i) the collapse time during collective catastrophe for a
multifilament system is much larger than that of a single filament with the
same average length, (ii) force-dependence of the cap-size distribution of
multiple filaments are quantitatively different from that of single filament,
(iii) the diffusion constant associated with the system length fluctuations is
distinct for multiple filaments, (iv) switching dynamics of multiple filaments

Intrusion detection system (IDS) has been widely deployed as a defense measure

collected data contains irrelevant and redundant features that affect the
detection rate of the IDS, consumes high amount of system resources, and

the quantum tunneling approach with WKB approximation and obtained the
tunneling rate of outgoing scalar and spinor particles across the horizons. We
have also obtained the Hawking temperature at the horizons corresponding to the
emission of these particles. It is shown that the tunneling rate and Hawking
temperature of generalized $(2+1)$-dimensional BTZ black holes are different
from ordinary $(2+1)$-dimensional BTZ black holes due to the Noether symmetry.
In other words, the Noether symmetry can change the tunneling rate and Hawking
temperature of the BTZ black holes. This symmetry may cause the BTZ black holes
to avoid of evaporation and its breakdown may start the evaporation.

  Proceedings of the 23rd International Conference on Very Large Databases
  (VLDB'1997), Athens, Greece, August 1997",,,,"cs.DB","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Scheduling query execution plans is a particularly complex problem in
shared-nothing parallel systems, where each site consists of a collection of
local time-shared (e.g., CPU(s) or disk(s)) and space-shared (e.g., memory)
resources and communicates with remote sites by message-passing. Earlier work
on parallel query scheduling employs either (a) one-dimensional models of
parallel task scheduling, effectively ignoring the potential benefits of
resource sharing, or (b) models of globally accessible resource units, which
are appropriate only for shared-memory architectures, since they cannot capture
the affinity of system resources to sites. In this paper, we develop a general
approach capturing the full complexity of scheduling distributed,
multi-dimensional resource units for all forms of parallelism within and across
queries and operators. We present a level-based list scheduling heuristic
algorithm for independent query tasks (i.e., physical operator pipelines) that
is provably near-optimal for given degrees of partitioned parallelism (with a
worst-case performance ratio that depends on the number of time-shared and
space-shared resources per site and the granularity of the clones). We also
propose extensions to handle blocking constraints in logical operator (e.g.,
hash-join) pipelines and bushy query plans as well as on-line task arrivals
(e.g., in a dynamic or multi-query execution environment). Experiments with our
scheduling algorithms implemented on top of a detailed simulation model verify
their effectiveness compared to existing approaches in a realistic setting.
Based on our analytical and experimental results, we revisit the open problem
of designing efficient cost models for parallel query optimization and propose
a solution that captures all the important parameters of parallel execution.

a fraction of the undelivered primary packets in a relaying queue (buffer). It
manages the flow of the undelivered primary packets to its relaying queue using
the appropriate actions over time slots. Moreover, it has the decision of
choosing the used queue for channel accessing at idle time slots (slots where
the PU's queue is empty). It is assumed that one data packet transmission
dissipates one energy packet. The optimal policy changes according to the
primary and CR users arrival rates to the data and energy queues as well as the
channels connectivity. The CR user saves energy for the PU by taking the
responsibility of relaying the undelivered primary packets. It optimally
organizes its own energy packets to maximize its payoff as time progresses.

exactly solving the LSR problem is very expensive. When $n \gg d$, one feasible
approach to speeding up LSR is to randomly embed $y$ and all columns of $X$

  We discuss in this paper two random sampling based methods for solving LSR
more efficiently. Previous work showed that the leverage scores based sampling
based LSR achieves $1+\epsilon$ accuracy when $c \geq O(d \epsilon^{-2} \log

that when $c \geq O(\mu d \epsilon^{-2} \log d)$, the uniform sampling based
LSR attains a $2+\epsilon$ bound with positive probability.

renormalizable Yukawa couplings between the new fermions and the SM Higgs
field, as well as for direct masses for the doublet (M_D) and the triplet
(M_T). After electroweak symmetry breaking, this model contains, in addition to
SM particles, two charged Dirac fermions and a set of three neutral Majorana
fermions, the lightest of which contributes to Dark Matter (DM). We consider a
case where the lightest neutral fermion is an equal admixture of the two
doublets with mass M_D close to the Z-boson mass. This state remains stable
under radiative corrections thanks to a custodial SU(2)-symmetry and is
consistent with the experimental data from oblique electroweak corrections.
Moreover, the amplitudes relevant to spin-dependent or independent nucleus-DM
particle scattering cross section both vanish at tree level. They arise at one
loop at a level that may be observed in near future DM direct detection
experiments. For Yukawa couplings comparable to the top-quark, the DM particle
relic abundance is consistent with observation, not relying on co-annihilation
or resonant effects and has a mass at the electroweak scale. Furthermore, the

using an auto-encoder is equivalent to minimizing the reconstruction error plus
some correcting terms which have an interpretation as either a denoising or
contractive property of the decoding function. These terms are related but not
identical to those used in denoising or contractive auto-encoders [Vincent et
al. 2010, Rifai et al. 2011]. In particular, the codelength viewpoint fully
determines an optimal noise level for the denoising criterion.

neutron stars can form through various n-body interactions. Such a binary could
emit a significant fraction of its binding energy in a sequence of largely
isolated gravitational wave bursts prior to merger. Given expected black hole
and neutron star masses, many such systems will emit these repeated bursts at
frequencies within the sensitive band of contemporary ground-based
gravitational wave detectors. Unfortunately, existing gravitational wave
searches are ill-suited to detect these signals. In this work, we adapt a
""power stacking"" method to the detection of gravitational wave signals from
highly eccentric binaries. We implement this method as an extension of the
Q-transform, a projection onto a multiresolution basis of windowed complex
exponentials that has previously been used to analyze data from the network of
LIGO/Virgo detectors. Our method searches for excess power over an ensemble of
time-frequency tiles. We characterize the performance of our method using Monte
Carlo experiments with signals injected in simulated detector noise. Our
results indicate that the power stacking method achieves substantially better
sensitivity to eccentric binary signals than existing localized burst searches.

for these detectors would be Newtonian noise, which is induced by fluctuations
in the local gravitational field. The hope is that a combination of a low-noise
seismic environment and coherent noise subtraction using seismometers in the
vicinity of the detector could suppress the Newtonian noise to below the
projected noise floor for future gravitational-wave detectors. In this paper,
we use Wiener filtering techniques to subtract coherent noise in a seismic
array in the frequency band 0.05 -- 1\,Hz. This achieves more than an order of
magnitude noise cancellation over a majority of this band. We show how this
subtraction would benefit proposed future low-frequency gravitational wave
detectors. The variation in the Wiener filter coefficients over the course of
the day, including how local activities impact the filter, is analyzed. We also
study the variation in coefficients over the course of a month, showing the
stability of the filter with time. How varying the filter order affects the
subtraction performance is also explored. It is shown that optimizing filter
order can significantly improve subtraction of seismic noise, which gives hope
for future gravitational-wave detectors to address Newtonian noise.

time-varying channels depends heavily on the accuracy of the Channel State
Information (CSI), which is usually quite ``costly'' in terms of consuming
network resources. Scheduling in such systems is also subject to stringent
constraints such as power and bandwidth, which limit the maximum number of
simultaneous transmissions. In the meanwhile, communication channels in
wireless systems typically fluctuate in a time-correlated manner. We hence
design schedulers to exploit the temporal-correlation inherent in channels with
memory and ARQ-styled feedback from the users for better channel state
knowledge, under the assumption of Markovian channels and the stringent
constraint on the maximum number of simultaneously active users. We model this
problem under the framework of a Partially Observable Markov Decision
Processes.
  In recent work, a low-complexity optimal solution was developed for this
problem under a long-term time-average resource constraint. However, in real
systems with instantaneous resource constraints, how to optimally exploit the
temporal correlation and satisfy realistic stringent constraint on the
instantaneous service remains elusive. In this work, we incorporate a stringent
constraint on the simultaneously scheduled users and propose a low-complexity
scheduling algorithm that dynamically implements user scheduling and dummy
packet broadcasting. We show that the throughput region of the optimal policy
under the long-term average resource constraint can be asymptotically achieved
in the stringent constrained scenario by the proposed algorithm, in the many

analysis of continuously dissipating, nonequilibrium steady states. For open
quantum systems, two seemingly distinct definitions for the nonadiabatic
entropy production have appeared in the literature, one based on the quantum
relative entropy and the other based on quantum trajectories. We show that
these two formulations are equivalent. Furthermore, this equivalence leads us
to a proof of the monotonicity of the quantum relative entropy under a special
class of completely-positive, trace-preserving quantum maps, which circumvents
difficulties associated with the noncommuntative structure of operators.

instrument as before based on concepts of thermostatics, to wich time, speed

aspects of this technologically relevant effect. Through appropriate choices of
free parameters the modelled hysteresis loops adequately match experiment, and
typical domain structures can be simulated. However, the use of these
parameters, notably the coupling strength between the systems' ferromagnetic
(F) and antiferromagnetic (AF) layers, obscures conclusions about their
influence on the magnetization reversal processes. Here we develop a 2D
phase-field model of the magnetization process in exchange-biased CoO/(Co/Pt)xn
that incorporates the 10 nm-resolved measured local biasing characteristics of
the antiferromagnet. Just three interrelated parameters set to measured
physical quantities of the ferromagnet and the measured density of
uncompensated spins thus suffice to match the experiment in microscopic and
macroscopic detail. We use the model to study changes in bias and coercivity
caused by different distributions of pinned uncompensated spins of the
antiferromagnet, in application-relevant situations where domain wall motion
dominates the ferromagnetic reversal. We show the excess coercivity can arise
solely from inhomogeneity in the density of biasing- and anti-biasing pinned
uncompensated spins in the antiferromagnet. Counter to conventional wisdom,
irreversible processes in the latter are not essential.

Kozak et al. [3] which has successfully discussed the deuteron-nucleus
scattering. 2. The second point is that we have used in our calculations
\b{eta}0 and not (which preserves the current conservation). Therefore, the
content of our work is correct.

In particular we show that the wave-packet pulls the block when it enters and
drags it when it leaves. The usual form of the center of mass motion theorem

increased due to the enhanced effective diameter through the wire-wire
