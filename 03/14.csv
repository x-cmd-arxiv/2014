  birth-death type systems","38 pages, 5 figures, to appear in J. Theor. Biol",,,,"q-bio.BM q-bio.CB q-bio.MN","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Cell systems consist of a huge number of various molecules that display
specific patterns of interactions, which have a determining influence on the
cell's functioning. In general, such complexity is seen to increase with the
complexity of the organism, with a concomitant increase of the accuracy and
specificity of the cellular processes. The question thus arises how the
complexification of systems - modeled here by simple interacting birth-death
type processes - can lead to a reduction of the noise - described by the
variance of the number of molecules. To gain understanding of this issue, we
investigated the difference between a single system containing molecules that
are produced and degraded, and the same system - with the same average number
of molecules - connected to a buffer. We modeled these systems using Ito
stochastic differential equations in discrete time, as they allow
straightforward analytical developments. In general, when the molecules in the
system and the buffer are positively correlated, the variance on the number of
molecules in the system is found to decrease compared to the equivalent system
without a buffer. Only buffers that are too noisy by themselves tend to
increase the noise in the main system. We tested this result on two model
cases, in which the system and the buffer contain proteins in their active and
inactive state, or protein monomers and homodimers. We found that in the second
test case, where the interconversion terms are non-linear in the number of
molecules, the noise reduction is much more pronounced; it reaches up to 20%
reduction of the Fano factor with the parameter values tested in numerical
simulations on an unperturbed birth-death model. We extended our analysis to
two arbitrary interconnected systems.

presents a thorough study and comparison of the many numerical approaches,
which, remarkably, is missing in the literature. Existing numerical approaches
can be classified into 3 categories: Finite difference methods, Fourier based

PDE-evolutions that were derived explicitly (in the spatial Fourier domain) in
previous works by Duits and van Almsick in 2005. Here we provide an overview of
these 3 types of exact solutions and explain how they relate to each of the 3
numerical approaches. We compute relative errors of all numerical approaches to
the exact solutions, and the Fourier based methods show us the best performance
with smallest relative errors. We also provide an improvement of Mathematica
algorithms for evaluating Mathieu-functions, crucial in implementations of the
exact solutions. Furthermore, we include an asymptotical analysis of the

distance of anomalous and galactic cosmic rays in the N-S heliosheaths as
observed by the Voyager 1 and 2 spacecraft respectively. The anomalous cosmic
ray (ACR) intensities above a few MeV in the N heliosheath reach a maximum at
~2009.5, about 16 AU beyond the heliospheric current sheet (HTS), thus
indicating a possible source location for these higher energy particles. The
galactic cosmic ray electron and nuclei intensities continue to increase
rapidly throughout the entire N-heliosheath out to 121.7 AU. Two sudden
increases of these electrons at 16.6 and 22.2 AU beyond the HTS suggest that
the V1 spacecraft passed significant heliosheath structures at these times.
Later, at 121.7 AU, which is a distance of 27.6 AU beyond the initial HTS
crossing distance, V1 in the N heliosheath appears to pass beyond the ACR
trapping region as the anomalous particles disappear suddenly and completely.
At V2 in the S heliosheath, large 42-21 day periodic intensity variations were
observed for a few MeV particles just beyond the HTS crossing distance at 83.7
AU and again about a year later when V2 was ~4 AU beyond this shock. These are
the dominant features of the energetic particle populations in the inner part
of the S-heliosheath. The ACR and electrons later decreased to almost
background levels until a sudden increase at 2011.25, at a distance of about 10
AU beyond the HTS. The features observed by V2 in the S heliosheath relative to
those at V1 indicate a much more structured S heliosheath in which the latitude
of V2 relative to the HCS maximum latitude (sector zone) may play an important
role. Estimates of a S heliosheath trapping/modulation boundary for energetic
particles in the range 105-110 AU are obtained in this paper from a comparison
with those at 121.7 AU observed in the N hemisphere.

used, together with the GLIMPSE 8 $\mu$m and MIPSGAL 24 $\mu$m data, to attempt
the first 3D-decomposition of dust emission associated with atomic, molecular
and ionized gas at 15 arcmin angular resolution. Our initial test case is a
2$\times$2 square degrees region centred on (l,b)=(30$^{\circ}$,0$^{\circ}$), a
direction that encompasses the origin point of the Scutum-Crux Arm at the tip
of the Galactic Bar. Coupling the IR maps with velocity maps specific for
different gas phases (HI 21cm, $^{12}$CO and $^{13}$CO, and RRLs), we estimate
the properties of dust blended with each of the gas components and at different
Galactocentric distances along the LOS. A statistical Pearson's coefficients
analysis is used to study the correlation between the column densities and the
intensity of the IR emission. This analysis provides evidence that the
2$\times$2 square degree field under consideration is characterized by the
presence of a gas component not accounted for by the standard tracers, possibly
associated with warm H$_{2}$ and cold HI. We demonstrate that the IR radiation
in the range 8 $\mu$m $<$ $\lambda$ $<$ 500 $\mu$m is systematically dominated
by emission originating within the Scutum-Crux Arm. By applying an inversion
method, we recover the dust emissivities associated with atomic, molecular and
ionized gas. Using the DustEM model we obtain an indication for PAHs depletion
in the diffuse ionized gas. However, the main goal of this work is to discuss
the impact of the missing column density associated with the dark gas component
on the accurate evaluation of the dust properties, and to shed light on the
limitations of the inversion method approach when this is applied to a small
section of the Galactic Plane and when the working resolution allows sufficient
de-blending of the gas components along the LOS.

target. We propose an architecture called secure overlay services (SOS) that
proactively prevents denial of service (DoS) attacks, which works toward
supporting emergency services, or similar types of communication. The
architecture uses a combination of secure overlay tunneling, routing via
consistent hashing, and filtering. We reduce the probability of successful
attacks by: 1) performing intensive filtering near protected network edges,
pushing the attack point into the core of the network, where high-speed routers
can handle the volume of attack traffic and 2) introducing randomness and
anonymity into the forwarding architecture, making it difficult for an attacker
to target nodes along the path to a specific SOSprotected destination. Using
simple analytical models, we evaluate the likelihood that an attacker can
successfully launch a DoS attack against an SOS protected network. Our analysis
demonstrates that such an architecture reduces the likelihood of a successful
attack to minuscule levels.

ionization, with detections of HI, NIII, NIV, NV, OIV, OIV*, OV, OVI, NeVIII,
MgX, SV and ArVIII. We estimate the total hydrogen number density from the

$\log(n_{\textrm{H}}/\textrm{cm}^3)\sim 3$. Assuming photoionization
equilibrium, we derive a distance to the absorbing complex of $2.3<R<6.0$ kpc
from the centre of the QSO. A range in ionization parameter, covering $\sim 2$
orders of magnitude, suggest absorption path lengths in the range
$10^{-4.5}<l_{\textrm{abs}}<1$ pc. In addition, the absorbing gas only
partially covers the background emission from the QSO continuum, which suggests
clouds with transverse sizes $l_{\textrm{trans}}<10^{-2.5}$ pc. Widely
differing absorption path lengths, combined with covering fractions less than
unity across all ions pose a challenge to models involving simple cloud
geometries. These issues may be mitigated by the presence of non-equilibrium
effects, together with the possibility of multiple gas temperatures. The
dynamics and expected lifetimes of the gas clouds suggest that they do not
originate from close to the AGN, but are instead formed close to their observed
location. Their inferred distance, outflow velocities and gas densities are
broadly consistent with scenarios involving gas entrainment or condensations in
winds driven by either supernovae, or the supermassive black hole accretion
disc. In the case of the latter, the present data most likely does not trace
the bulk of the outflow by mass, which could instead manifest itself as an

finite-memory model is harder to analyze mathematically but, in contrast to
previous models, it is valid also for nonstationary or heavy-tailed input
signals. For uncoded transmission and standard modulation formats, the new
model gives the same results as the regular GN model when the memory of the

that the GN model is accurate for uncoded transmission. However, when coding is
considered, the results obtained using the finite-memory model are very
different from those obtained by previous models, even when the channel memory
is large. In particular, the peaky behavior of the channel capacity, which has

observed correlations. In this work we reverse this research program and ask
what do the randomness certification capabilities of a theory tell us about the

maximally nonlocal theories cannot allow maximal randomness certification. We
go on and show that quantum theory, in contrast, permits certification of
maximal randomness in all dichotomic scenarios. We hence pose the question of
whether quantum theory is optimal for randomness, i.e. is it the most nonlocal
theory that allows maximal randomness certification? We answer this question in
the negative by identifying a larger-than-quantum set of correlations capable
of this feat. Not only are these results relevant to understanding quantum
mechanics' fundamental features, but also put fundamental restrictions on
device-independent protocols based on the no-signaling principle.

repulsive inter-particle interactions. By using a variational approach, and by
choosing an appropriate trial wave function, we reformulate the
Gross-Pitaevskii equation with spherical symmetry as Newton's equation of
motion for a particle in an effective potential, which is determined by the
zero point kinetic energy, the gravitational energy, and the particles
interaction energy, respectively. The velocity of the condensate is
proportional to the radial distance, with a time dependent proportionality
function. The equation of motion of the collapsing dark matter condensate is
studied by using both analytical and numerical methods. The collapse of the
condensate ends with the formation of a stable configuration, corresponding to
the minimum of the effective potential. The radius and the mass of the
resulting dark matter object are obtained, as well as the collapse time of the
condensate. The numerical values of these global astrophysical quantities,
characterizing condensed dark matter systems, strongly depend on the two
parameters describing the condensate, the mass of the dark matter particle, and
of the scattering length, respectively. The stability of the condensate under
small perturbations is also studied, and the oscillations frequency of the halo

observation that the pricing kernel admits a representation in terms of the
conditional variance of a square-integrable random variable, which in turn
admits a chaos expansion. When the expansion coefficients factorise into
multiple copies of a single function, then the resulting interest rate model is
called coherent, whereas a generic interest rate model will necessarily be
incoherent. Coherent representations are nevertheless of fundamental importance
because incoherent ones can always be expressed as a linear superposition of
coherent elements. This property is exploited to derive general expressions for
the pricing kernel and the associated bond price and short rate processes in
the case of an n-th order chaos model for each $n$. The pricing formulae for
bond options and swaptions are obtained in closed forms for a number of
examples. An explicit representation for the pricing kernel of a
generic---incoherent---model is then obtained by use of the underlying coherent
elements. Finally, finite-dimensional realisations of the coherent chaos models
are investigated in detail. In particular, it is shown that a class of highly
tractable models can be constructed having the characteristic feature that the
discount bond price is given by a piecewise flat (simple) process.

random in-plane ordering in the monolayer, i.e. planar nematic ordering takes
place even at vanishing densities. It is found that the random in-plane
ordering is not favorable at higher densities and the system undergoes an
in-plane ordering transition forming a biaxial nematic phase or crystallizes.
For certain values of the aspect ratio, the uniaxial-biaxial nematic phase
transition is observed for both rod-like and plate-like shapes. The stability
region of the biaxial nematic phase enhances with decreasing aspect ratios for
plate-like particles, while the rod-like particles exhibit a reentrant
phenomenon, i.e. a sequence of uniaxial-biaxial-uniaxial nematic ordering with
increasing density if the aspect ratio is larger than 21.34. In addition to
this, packing fraction inversion is observed with increasing surface pressure
due to the alignment along the layers normal. At very high densities the
nematic phase destabilizes to a nonuniform phases (columnar, smectic or
crystalline phases) for both shapes.

serves multiple single-antenna users in the same time-frequency resource. So
far, investigations are mostly based on theoretical channels with independent
and identically distributed (i.i.d.) complex Gaussian coefficients, i.e.,

performed at 2.6 GHz using a virtual uniform linear array (ULA) which has a
physically large aperture, and a practical uniform cylindrical array (UCA)

its hopping properties]; (ii) a pair of holes [their (relative) particle

of holes. We find that each hole in the doped model has an eight-dimensional
internal space, characterized by three internal quantum numbers: the first two
""fractional"" quantum numbers describe the binding to the hole of the fractional
excitations (fluxes and fermions) of the undoped model, while the third ""spin""
quantum number determines the local magnetization around the hole. The
fractional quantum numbers also encode fundamentally distinct particle
properties, topologically robust against small local perturbations: some holes
are free to hop in two dimensions, while others are confined to hop in one
dimension only; distinct hole types have different particle statistics, and in
particular, some of them exhibit non-trivial (anyonic) relative statistics.
These particle properties in turn determine the physical properties of the
multi-hole ground state at finite doping, and we identify two distinct ground
states with different hole types that are stable for different model
parameters. The respective hopping dimensionalities manifest themselves in an
electrical conductivity approximately isotropic in one ground state and
extremely anisotropic in the other one. We also compare our microscopic study

(AGN) jets are expected to drive turbulence and heat cluster cores. Cooling of
the intracluster medium (ICM) and stirring by AGN jets are tightly coupled in a
feedback loop. We impose the feedback loop by balancing radiative cooling with
turbulent heating. In addition to heating the plasma, turbulence also mixes it,
suppressing the formation of cold gas at small scales. In this regard, the
effect of turbulence is analogous to thermal conduction. For uniform plasma in
thermal balance (turbulent heating balancing radiative cooling), cold gas
condenses only if the cooling time is shorter than the mixing time. This
condition requires the turbulent kinetic energy to be $\gtrsim$ the plasma
internal energy; such high velocities in cool cores are ruled out by
observations. The results with realistic magnetic fields and thermal conduction
are qualitatively similar to the hydrodynamic simulations. Simulations where
the runaway cooling of the cool core is prevented due to {\em mixing} with the
hot ICM show cold gas even with subsonic turbulence, consistent with
observations. Thus, turbulent mixing is the likely mechanism via which AGN jets
heat cluster cores. The thermal instability growth rates observed in
simulations with turbulence are consistent with the local thermal instability
interpretation of cold gas in cluster cores.

at the electroweak scale, and opens thus new possibilities for testing
SU(5)-like GUTs. We derive the low-energy effective theory of observable light
up-type squarks, that also constitutes a useful tool for squark phenomenology.
We use this effective theory to determine how to test SU(5) relations at the
LHC. Focussing on scenarios with light stops, compatible with Natural SUSY, it
appears that simple tests involving ratios of event rates are sufficient to
test the hypothesis of a SU(5)-like GUT theory. The techniques of charm-tagging
and top-polarimetry are a crucial ingredient of these tests.

luminous X-ray pulse is considerably longer than expected for a spherical
breakout through the surface of a type Ibc SN progenitor, and the X-ray

We find that the inferred progenitor and SN parameters are typical for an
exploding Wolf-Rayet. A comparison of the wind density found at the breakout
radius to the density at much larger radii, as inferred by late radio
observations, suggests an enhanced mass loss rate taking effect about ten days
or less prior to the SN explosion. This finding joins accumulating evidence for
a possible late phase in the stellar evolution of massive stars, involving
vigorous mass loss a short time before the SN explosion.

study the widely used N-body simulation fit of Tinker et al. (T08) and, as an
alternative, the recently proposed analytical model of Excursion Set Peaks
(ESP). We first assess the relative bias between these prescriptions when
constraining \sigma_8 by sampling the ESP mass function to generate mock
catalogs and using the T08 fit to analyse them, for various choices of survey
selection threshold, mass definition and statistical priors. To assess the
level of absolute bias in each prescription, we then repeat the analysis on
dark matter halo catalogs in N-body simulations designed to mimic the mass
distribution in the current data release of Planck SZ clusters. This N-body
analysis shows that using the T08 fit without accounting for the scatter
introduced when converting between mass definitions (alternatively, the scatter
induced by errors on the parameters of the fit) can systematically
over-estimate the value of \sigma_8 by as much as 2\sigma\ for current data,
while analyses that account for this scatter should be close to unbiased in
\sigma_8. With an increased number of objects as expected in upcoming data
releases, regardless of accounting for scatter, the T08 fit could over-estimate
the value of \sigma_8 by ~1.5\sigma. The ESP mass function leads to
systematically more biased but comparable results. A strength of the ESP model
is its natural prediction of a weak non-universality in the mass function which
closely tracks the one measured in simulations and described by the T08 fit. We
suggest that it might now be prudent to build new unbiased ESP-based fitting
functions for use with the larger datasets of the near future.

prolonging its star-formation by several Gyrs. Therefore, if our hypothesis

increased, and rationalize the evolution of the average cluster size by
developing a kinetic model of reversible aggregation. As density is increased,
the nonequilibrium clusters percolate to form a ramified structure reminiscent

needed to trigger a nonequilibrium phase separation, showing that demixing in
active Brownian particles results from a delicate balance between noise,
interparticle interactions and self-propulsion. We show that self-propulsion
has a profound influence on the dynamics of the active fluid. We find that the

small scales is described by the three-point correlation function (bispectrum)
in the so-called ""squeezed configurations,"" in which one wavenumber, say $k_3$,
is much smaller than the other two, i.e., $k_3\ll k_1\approx k_2$. This
bispectrum is generated by non-linear gravitational evolution and possibly also
by inflationary physics. In this paper, we use this fact to show that the
bispectrum in the squeezed configurations can be measured without employing
three-point function estimators. Specifically, we use the ""position-dependent
power spectrum,"" i.e., the power spectrum measured in smaller subvolumes of the
survey (or simulation box), and correlate it with the mean overdensity of the
corresponding subvolume. This correlation directly measures an integral of the
bispectrum dominated by the squeezed configurations. Measuring this correlation
is only slightly more complex than measuring the power spectrum itself, and
sidesteps the considerable complexity of the full bispectrum estimation. We use
cosmological $N$-body simulations of collisionless particles with Gaussian
initial conditions to show that the measured correlation between the
position-dependent power spectrum and the long-wavelength overdensity agrees
with the theoretical expectation. The position-dependent power spectrum thus
provides a new, efficient, and promising way to measure the squeezed-limit
bispectrum from large-scale structure observations such as galaxy redshift

population is sufficient to predict the number of genetic variants in the
entire population within $6\%$ of the correct value, using an estimator
agnostic to demography, selection, or population structure. To reach similar
accuracy in a finite genome with millions of polymorphisms, the pilot study
would require about $15\%$ of the population. We present computationally
efficient jackknife and linear programming methods that exhibit substantially
less bias than the state of the art when applied to simulated data and
sub-sampled 1000 Genomes Project data. Extrapolating based on the NHLBI Exome
Sequencing Project data, we predict that $7.2\%$ of sites in the capture region
would be variable in a sample of $50,000$ African-Americans, and $8.8\%$ in a
European sample of equal size. Finally, we show how the linear programming
method can also predict discovery rates of various genomic features, such as
the number of transcription factor binding sites across different cell types.

the rep- resentation theory of the super-BMS algebra of Awada, Gibbons and

role is played by singular functions concentrated at zero momentum, and I argue
that the formalism of Holographic Space- Time is the appropriate regulator for
the singularities. It involves a choice of a time-like trajectory in Minkowski

capturing the hybridization between half-integer spin (Kramers) conduction
electrons and the non-Kramers 5f^2 Ising local moments, as strongly indicated
by the observation of Ising quasiparticles in de Haas-van Alphen measurements.
Hastatic order differs from conventional magnetism as it is a spinor order that
breaks both single and double time-reversal symmetry by mixing states of
different Kramers parity. The broken time-reversal symmetry simply explains
both the pseudo-Goldstone mode between the hidden order and antiferromagnetic
phases and the nematic order seen in torque magnetometry. The spinorial nature
of the hybridization also explains how the Kondo effect gives a phase
transition, with the hybridization gap turning on at the hidden order
transition as seen in scanning tunneling microscopy. Hastatic order also has a
number of new predictions: a basal-plane magnetic moment of order .01\mu_B, a
gap to longitudinal spin fluctuations that vanishes continuously at the first
order antiferromagnetic transition and a narrow resonant nematic feature in the
scanning tunneling spectra.

constructed by acting on a suitable vacuum state with boundary observables
contained within any subset of the boundary is dense in the Hilbert space of
the bulk theory. To prove this theorem we need two ingredients which are
themselves of interest. First, we prove a purely bulk version of Reeh-Schlieder
theorem for an AdS Klein-Gordon field. This theorem relies on the analyticity
properties of certain vacuum states. Our second ingredient is a
boundary-to-bulk map for local observables on an AdS causal wedge. This mapping
is achieved by simple integral kernels which construct bulk observables from
convolutions with boundary operators. Our analysis improves on previous
constructions of AdS boundary-to-bulk maps in that it is formulated entirely in
Lorentz signature without the need for large analytic continuation of spatial
coordinates. Both our Reeh-Schlieder theorem and boundary-to-bulk maps may be
applied to globally well-defined states constructed from the usual AdS vacuum
as well more singular states such as the local vacuum of an AdS causal wedge
which is singular on the horizon.

for a shorter action horizon, where both are defined by certain events

be used to distinguish between various atmospheric models of sunspots, whose
temperature structure in the upper photosphere and chromosphere has been the
source of some controversy. Methods: We use observations of the temperature
contrast (relative to the quiet Sun) above a sunspot umbra at 3.5 mm obtained
with the Berkeley-Illinois-Maryland Array (BIMA), complemented by submm
observations from Lindsey & Kopp (1995) and 2 cm observations with the Very
Large Array. These are compared with the umbral contrast calculated from
various atmospheric models of sunspots. Results: Current mm and submm
observational data suggest that the brightness observed at these wavelengths is
low compared to the most widely used sunspot models. These data impose strong
constraints on the temperature and density stratifications of the sunspot
umbral atmosphere, in particular on the location and depth of the temperature
minimum and the location of the transition region. Conclusions: A successful
model that is in agreement with millimeter umbral brightness should have an
extended and deep temperature minimum (below 3000 K). Better spatial resolution
as well as better wavelength coverage are needed for a more complete
determination of the chromospheric temperature stratification above sunspot
umbrae.

studied the mutual effect of the DM interaction and TF on the thermal

with the critical exponent equal to the critical gap exponent. We also argued
that thermodynamical properties like the specific heat and the magnetocaloric

the mentioned quantum entanglement in solid systems. In addition, we suggest a
tactic to find all critical temperatures, which is based on the derivative of
the entanglement witness with respect to the temperature.

equivalent widths. We use multiwavelength COSMOS photometry, HST-ACS I-band
imaging and optical zCOSMOS spectroscopy to derive the main global properties
of EELGs, such as sizes, masses, SFRs, reliable metallicities from both
""direct"" and ""strong-line"" methods. The EELGs are compact (R_50 ~ 1.3 kpc),
low-mass (log(M*/Msol)~7-10) galaxies forming stars at unusually high specific
SFR (log(sSFR/yr) up to ~ -7) compared to main sequence SFGs of the same
stellar mass and redshift. At UV wavelengths, the EELGs are luminous and show
high surface brightness and include strong Ly$\alpha$ emitters, as revealed by
GALEX spectroscopy. We show that zCOSMOS EELGs are high-ionization,
low-metallicity systems, with median 12+log(O/H)=8.16, including a handful of
extremely metal-deficient galaxies (<10% solar). While ~80% of the EELGs show
non-axisymmetric morphologies, including clumpy and tadpole galaxies, we find
that ~29% of them show additional low surface-brightness features, which
strongly suggest recent or ongoing interactions. As star-forming dwarfs in the
local Universe, EELGs are most often found in relative isolation. While only
very few EELGs belong to compact groups, almost one third of them are found in
spectroscopically confirmed loose pairs or triplets. We conclude that EELGs are
galaxies caught in a transient and probably early period of their evolution,
where they are efficiently building-up a significant fraction of their
present-day stellar mass in an ongoing galaxy-wide starburst. Therefore, the
EELGs constitute an ideal benchmark for comparison studies between low- and
high-redshift low-mass star-forming galaxies.

usual elasticity tensors to become positive-semidefinite. We prove that,

present such a schematic ribbon diagram for the $\alpha^2$ dynamo that tracks
magnetic helicity and provides distinct scales of large scale magnetic
helicity, small scale magnetic helicity, and kinetic helicity involved in the
process. This also motivates our construction of a new ""2.5 scale"" minimalist
generalization of the helicity-evolving equations for the \alpha^2 dynamo that
separately allows for these three distinct length scales while keeping only two
dynamical equations. We solve these equations and, as in previous studies, find
that the large scale field first grows at a rate independent of the magnetic
Reynolds number R_M before quenching to an R_M dependent regime. But we also
show that the larger the ratio of the wavenumber where the small scale current
helicity resides to that of the forcing scale, the earlier the non-linear
dynamo quenching occurs, and the weaker the large scale field is at the turnoff
from linear growth. The harmony between the theory and the schematic diagram
exemplifies a general lesson that magnetic fields in MHD are better visualized
as two-dimensional ribbons (or pairs of lines) rather than single lines.

which are chiral, massless particles, can emerge in certain bulk materials or
in topological insulator multilayers and can produce unusual transport
properties, such as charge pumping driven by a chiral anomaly. A pair of Weyl
fermions protected by crystalline symmetry, effectively forming a massless
Dirac fermion, has been predicted to appear as low energy excitations in a
number of candidate materials termed three-dimensional (3D) Dirac semimetals.
Here we report scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) measurements at sub-Kelvin
temperatures and high magnetic fields on one promising host material, the II-V
semiconductor Cd3As2. Our study provides the first atomic scale probe of
Cd3As2, showing that defects mostly influence the valence band, consistent with
the observation of ultra-high mobility carriers in the conduction band. By
combining Landau level spectroscopy and quasiparticle interference (QPI), we
distinguish a large spin-splitting of the conduction band in a magnetic field
and its extended Dirac-like dispersion above the expected regime. A model band
structure consistent with our experimental findings suggests that for a
specific orientation of the applied magnetic field, Weyl fermions are the
low-energy excitations in Cd3As2.

source of phenotypic variation. The question of how closely the effects of
genetic variation on protein levels mirror those on mRNA levels remains open.
Here, we addressed this question by using ribosome profiling to examine how
genetic differences between two strains of the yeast S. cerevisiae affect
translation. Strain differences in translation were observed for hundreds of
genes. Allele specific measurements in the diploid hybrid between the two
strains revealed roughly half as many cis-acting effects on translation as were
observed for mRNA levels. In both the parents and the hybrid, most effects on
translation were of small magnitude, such that the direction of an mRNA
difference was typically reflected in a concordant footprint difference. The
relative importance of cis and trans acting variation on footprint levels was
similar to that for mRNA levels. There was a tendency for translation to cause
larger footprint differences than expected given the respective mRNA
differences. This is in contrast to translational differences between yeast
species that have been reported to more often oppose than reinforce mRNA
differences. Finally, we catalogued instances of premature translation
termination in the two yeast strains and also found several instances where
erroneous reference gene annotations lead to apparent nonsense mutations that
in fact reside outside of the translated gene body. Overall, genetic influences
on translation subtly modulate gene expression differences, and translation
does not create strong discrepancies between genetic influences on mRNA and

Similar to
vector consensus [13, 20, 19], the input at each process is a d-dimensional
vector of reals (or, equivalently, a point in the d-dimensional Euclidean
space). However, for convex consensus, the output at each process is a convex
polytope contained within the convex hull of the inputs at the fault-free
processes. We explore the convex consensus problem under crash faults with
incorrect inputs, and present an asynchronous approximate convex consensus
algorithm with optimal fault tolerance that reaches consensus on an optimal
output polytope. Convex consensus can be used to solve other related problems.
For instance, a solution for convex consensus trivially yields a solution for
vector consensus. More importantly, convex consensus can potentially be used to
solve other more interesting problems, such as convex function optimization [5,
4].

vector-valued channels to the terminals, is one of the key properties of the
radio channel that is exploited in Massive MIMO. However, there has been little
work that studies this topic in detail. In this paper, we first show that
favorable propagation offers the most desirable scenario in terms of maximizing
the sum-capacity. One useful proxy for whether propagation is favorable or not
is the channel condition number. However, this proxy is not good for the case
where the norms of the channel vectors may not be equal. For this case, to
evaluate how favorable the propagation offered by the channel is, we propose a
``distance from favorable propagation'' measure, which is the gap between the
sum-capacity and the maximum capacity obtained under favorable propagation.
Secondly, we examine how favorable the channels can be for two extreme
scenarios: i.i.d. Rayleigh fading and uniform random line-of-sight (UR-LoS).
Both environments offer (nearly) favorable propagation. Furthermore, to analyze
the UR-LoS model, we propose an urns-and-balls model. This model is simple and
explains the singular value spread characteristic of the UR-LoS model well.

geometric structure, governed by a nonlinear integrable differential equation,
and each solution of this equation determines a background geometry on which,
for any Lie group $G$, an integrable gauge theory is defined. In four
dimensions, the geometry is selfdual conformal geometry and the gauge theory is
selfdual Yang-Mills theory, while the lower-dimensional structures are
nondegenerate (i.e., non-null) reductions of this. Any solution of the gauge
theory on a $k$-dimensional geometry, such that the gauge group $H$ acts
transitively on an $\ell$-manifold, determines a $(k+\ell)$-dimensional
geometry ($k+\ell\leqslant4$) fibering over the $k$-dimensional geometry with
$H$ as a structure group. In the case of an $\ell$-dimensional group $H$ acting
on itself by the regular representation, all $(k+\ell)$-dimensional geometries
with symmetry group $H$ are locally obtained in this way. This framework
unifies and extends known results about dimensional reductions of selfdual
conformal geometry and the selfdual Yang-Mills equation, and provides a rich
supply of constructive methods. In one dimension, generalized Nahm equations
provide a uniform description of four pole isomonodromic deformation problems,
and may be related to the ${\rm SU}(\infty)$ Toda and dKP equations via a
hodograph transformation. In two dimensions, the ${\rm Diff}(S^1)$ Hitchin

threshold cascade model to a multiplex network in which nodes follow one of two
response rules: some nodes activate when, in at least one layer, a large enough
fraction of neighbors are active, while the other nodes activate when, in all
layers, a large enough fraction of neighbors are active. Varying the fractions
of nodes following either rule facilitates or inhibits cascades. Near the
inhibition regime, global cascades appear discontinuously as the network

behavior suggests a way in which various collective phenomena in the real world

rapidly rotating neutron star to explain the coherent frequency identified in
the light curves of a millisecond X-ray pulsar XTE J1751-305. The spin
frequency of the pulsar is $\nu_{\rm spin}\cong435$Hz and the identified
coherent frequency is $\nu_{\rm osc}=0.5727595\times\nu_{\rm spin}$. Assuming
the frequency identified is that observed in the corotating frame of the
neutron star, we find that the surface $r$-modes of $l^\prime=m=1$ and 2
excited by $\epsilon$-mechanism due to helium burning in the thin shell can
give the frequency ratio $\kappa=\nu_{\rm osc}/\nu_{\rm spin}\simeq0.57$ at
$\nu_{\rm spin}=435$Hz. As another candidate for the observed ratio $\kappa$,
we also suggest a toroidal crustal mode that has penetrating amplitudes in the
fluid core and is destabilized by gravitational wave emission.
  Since the surface fluid layer is separated from the fluid core by a solid
crust, the amplitudes of an $r$-mode in the core, which is destabilized by
emitting gravitational waves, can be by a large factor different from those in
the fluid ocean. We find that the amplification factor defined as $f_{\rm
amp}=\alpha_{\rm surface}/\alpha_{\rm core}$ is as large as $f_{\rm amp}\sim
10^2$ for the $l^\prime=m=2$ $r$-mode at $\nu_{\rm spin}=435$Hz for a
$M=1.4M_\odot$ neutron star model. Because of this significant amplification of
the $r$-mode amplitudes in the surface fluid layer, we suggest that, when
proper corrections to the $r$-mode frequency such as due to the general
relativistic effects are taken into consideration, the core $r$-mode of
$l^\prime=m=2$ can be a candidate for the detected frequency, without leading
to serious contradictions to, for example, the spin evolution of the underlying
neutron star.

particle acceleration in the M87 jet: a magnetically dominated relativistic
flow that naturally produces four relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) shocks
(forward/reverse fast and slow modes). We apply this model to a set of optical
super- and subluminal motions discovered by Biretta and coworkers with the {\em
Hubble Space Telescope} during 1994 -- 1998. The model concept consists of
ejection of a {\em single} relativistic Poynting jet, which possesses a
coherent helical (poloidal + toroidal) magnetic component, at the remarkably
flaring point HST-1. We are able to reproduce quantitatively proper motions of
components seen in the {\em optical} observations of HST-1 with the same model
we used previously to describe similar features in radio VLBI observations in
2005 -- 2006. This indicates that the quad relativistic MHD shock model can be
applied generally to recurring pairs of super/subluminal knots ejected from the
upstream edge of the HST-1 complex as observed from radio to optical
wavelengths, with forward/reverse fast-mode MHD shocks then responsible for
observed moving features. Moreover, we identify such intrinsic properties as
the shock compression ratio, degree of magnetization, and magnetic obliquity
and show that they are suitable to mediate diffusive shock acceleration of
relativistic particles via the first-order Fermi process. We suggest that
relativistic MHD shocks in Poynting-flux dominated helical jets may play a role
in explaining observed emission and proper motions in many AGNs.

compared to the 1D models, mainly due to the temperature stratifications and
temperature gradients being different in the 3D models compared to those

we use star counts method to estimate the Galactic structure parameters in an
intermediate latitude with 10,180 main-sequence (MS) stars in absolute
magnitude interval of $4 \leq M_r \leq 13$. We divide the absolute magnitude
into five intervals:$4 \leq M_r < 5$, $5 \leq M_r < 6$, $6 \leq M_r < 8$, $8
\leq M_r < 10$, $10 \leq M_r \leq 13$, and estimate the Galactic structure
parameters in each absolute magnitude interval to explore their possible
variation with the absolute magnitude. Our study shows the parameters depend on
absolute magnitude. For the thin disk, the intrinsic faint MS stars have large
local space density and they tend to stay close to the Galactic plane. A
plausible explanation is that faint MS stars with long lifetime experience long
gravitational interaction time result in a short scaleheight. However, for the
thick disk, the parameters show a complex trend with absolute magnitude, which
may imply the complicated original of the thick disk. For the halo, the
intrinsic faint MS stars have large local density and small axial ratio, which
indicate a flattened inner halo and a more spherical outer halo.

wave scattering effects. The model is applied to characterise the wave
reflection and transmission properties of a strip of ice floes, such as an ice

directional wave spectra produced by the array. The method builds upon an
integral mapping from polar to Cartesian coordinates of the scattered wave

perturbed from a regular arrangement. Results for random arrays are generated
using ensemble averaging. A realistic ice edge band is then reconstructed from
field experiments data. Simulations show a good qualitative agreement with the

particular, it is observed that short waves become isotropic quickly after
penetrating the ice field.

cationic system. Furthermore, the frontier orbitals of the cationic system tend
to have more effects from the pairing and inclusion of the backbone than the

two types of approximations: (2+1)-cluster approximation and isolated

is able to capture non-Gaussian spatial dependencies. For the purpose of model
development and as an illustration we consider daily mean temperature data

between the vine copula parameters and the station distances and exploit it in
order to reduce the huge number of parameters needed to parametrize a
54-dimensional R-vine model needed to fit the data. The new distance based
model parametrization results in a distinct reduction in the number of

locations feasible. The prediction capabilities are validated using adequate
scoring techniques, showing a better performance of the spatial R-vine copula

sources, as part of an information database, or more specifically, a 'concept

sources when consistent sequences of concepts are presented. They might be
considered to be dynamic databases, possibly a variation on the distributed
Agent-Based or Cellular Automata models, or even related to Markov models.
Semantic comparison of text is required, but the trees can be built more, from
automatic knowledge and statistical feedback. This reduced model might also be
attractive for security or privacy reasons, as not all of the potential data
gets saved. The construction process maintains the key requirement of
generality, allowing it to be used as part of a generic framework. The nature
of the method also means that some level of optimisation or normalisation of
the information will occur. This gives comparisons with databases or
knowledge-bases, but a database system would firstly model its environment or
datasets and then populate the database with instance values. The concept base
deals with a more uncertain environment and therefore cannot fully model it
beforehand. The model itself therefore evolves over time. Similar to databases,
it also needs a good indexing system, where the construction process provides
memory and indexing structures. These allow for more complex concepts to be
automatically created, stored and retrieved, possibly as part of a more
cognitive model. There are also some arguments, or more abstract ideas, for
merging physical-world laws into these automatic processes.

importance of synergistic disease interactions is now recognized. As a first
step we present and analyze a simple coinfection model for two diseases
affecting simultaneously a population. The host population is affected by the
\emph{primary disease}, a long-term infection whose dynamics is described by a
SIS model with demography, which facilitates individuals acquiring a second
disease, \emph{secondary (or \emph{opportunistic}) disease}. The secondary
disease is instead a short-term infection affecting only the primary-infected
individuals. Its dynamics is also represented by a SIS model with no
demography. To distinguish between short and long-term infection the complete
model is written as a two time scales system. The primary disease acts at the
slow time scale while the secondary disease does at the fast one, allowing a
dimension reduction of the system and making its analysis tractable. We show
that an opportunistic disease outbreak might change drastically the outcome of
the primary epidemic process, although it does among the outcomes allowed by
the primary disease. We have found situations in which either acting on the
opportunistic disease transmission or recovery rates or controlling the
susceptible and infected population size allow to eradicate/promote disease
endemicity.

control of all relevant SO fields in GaAs quantum wells, allowing us to tune
the Rashba and Dresselhaus SO fields while keeping both locked to each other

analysis (Ozel et al. 2013) relative to a seismically similar star, HD 181420

results provided by Ozel et al. (2013) indicate the possibility of HD 175272
having subsolar mass, while being of the order of 1000 K hotter than the Sun.
This seems unphysical -- standard stellar evolution theory generally does not
predict solar-metallicity stars of subsolar mass to be hotter than about 6000K
-- and calls for a reanalysis of this star. Aims: We aim to compare the
performance of differential asteroseismic analysis with that of grid-based
modelling. Methods: We use two sets of stellar model grids and two grid-fitting
methods to model HD 175272 and HD 181420. Results: We find that we are able to
model both stars with parameters that are both mutually compatible and
comparable with other modelling efforts. Hence, with modest spectroscopic and
asteroseismic inputs, we obtain reasonable estimates of stellar parameters. In
the case of HD 175272, the uncertainties of the stellar parameters from our
grid-based modelling are smaller, and hence more physical, than those reported
in the differential analysis. Conclusions: Grid-based modelling provides more
precise and more realistic results than obtained with differential seismology.

usefulness of the [CI] 609 micron and 370 micron fine structure emission lines
as tracers of cloud structure. Emission from these lines is observed throughout
molecular clouds, and yet the question of what we can learn from them about the
physics of the clouds remains largely unexplored.
  We show that the fact that [CI] emission is widespread within molecular
clouds is a simple consequence of the fact that the clouds are dominated by
turbulent motions. Turbulence creates large density inhomogeneities, allowing
radiation to penetrate deeply into the clouds. As a result, [CI] emitting gas
is found throughout the cloud, rather than being concentrated at the edges. We
examine how well we can use [CI] emission to trace the structure of the cloud,
and show that the integrated intensity of the 609 micron line traces column
density accurately over a wide range of visual extinctions. For extinctions
greater than a few, [CI] and 13CO both perform well, but [CI] becomes a
superior tracer of column densities for visual extinctions A_V <= 3
  We have also studied the distribution of [CI] excitation temperatures in the
gas, and show that these are typically smaller than the kinetic temperature,
indicating that most of the carbon atoms are not in local thermodynamic
equilibrium. We discuss how best to determine T_ex from observations of the
[CI] lines, and how to use these values to estimate the column density of
neutral atomic carbon. We show that even in the best case, we tend to
systematically underestimate the atomic carbon content of the gas. Our results
suggest that observationally-derived estimates of the atomic carbon content of

ultrasonic Doppler velocimetry to diagnose the fluid velocity in a rotating and
precessing cylindrical annulus. When precession is weak, the flow can be
described as a superposition of forced inertial modes. Above a critical value
of the precession rate, the forced flow couples with two free inertial modes
satisfying triadic resonance conditions, leading to the classical growth and
collapse. Using a Bayesian approach, we extract the wavenumber, frequency,
growth rate and amplitude of each mode involved in the instability. In some
cases, we observe for the first time ever experimentally two pairs of free
modes coexisting with the forced flow. At larger precession rates, we do not
observe triadic resonance any more, instead we observe several harmonics whose

physical properties. FS90-98, FS90-106, and FS90-147 are confirmed as BCDs and

star-forming galaxies. Based on our data, we studied some fundamental relations
to compare star forming dwarfs (BCDs and dIs) in the LV and in the Virgo,

appear to follow same fundamental relations in the near infrared with similar
objects in the LV, specifically the size-luminosity and the
metallicity-luminosity, while other more fundamental relations could not be
checked in Antlia due to lack of data.

collisions poses many basic problems: why do even elementary, $e^+e^-$ and

interactions a suppression of strange particle production? Why does the
strangeness suppression almost disappear in relativistic heavy ion collisions?
Why in these collisions is the thermalization time less than $\simeq 0.5$ fm/c?
We show that the recently proposed mechanism of thermal hadron production
through Hawking-Unruh radiation can naturally answer the previous questions.
Indeed, the interpretation of quark- antiquark pairs production, by the
sequential string breaking, as tunneling through the event horizon of colour
confinement leads to thermal behavior with a universal temperature, $T \simeq
170$ Mev,related to the quark acceleration, a, by $T=a/2\pi$. The resulting
temperature depends on the quark mass and then on the content of the produced
hadrons, causing a deviation from full equilibrium and hence a suppression of
strange particle production in elementary collisions. In nucleus-nucleus
collisions, where the quark density is much bigger, one has to introduce an
average temperature (acceleration) which dilutes the quark mass effect and the
strangeness suppression almost disappears.

formed. Pre-dosing the Cu(100) surface with a chemisorbed layer of oxygen
before graphene growth was found to adversely affect the crystal quality of the
graphene overlayer by inducing a much higher degree of rotational disorder of
the graphene grains with respect to the Cu(100) substrate. The growth

monitored with \emph{ex-situ} scanning electron microscopy. The nucleation rate
of the graphene islands was observed to drop by an order of magnitude by

This reduction in nucleation rate results in the formation of much larger

network services is the virtual network (VN) embedding protocol. In this paper,
we use decomposition theory to provide a unifying architecture for the VN
embedding problem. We show how our architecture subsumes existing solutions,
and how it can be used by cloud providers to design a distributed VN embedding
protocol that adapts to different scenarios, by merely instantiating different
decomposition policies. We analyze key representative tradeoffs via simulation,
and with our VN embedding testbed that uses a Linux system architecture to
reserve virtual node and link capacities. In contrast with existing VN
embedding solutions, we found that partitioning a VN request not only increases
the signaling overhead, but may decrease cloud providers' revenue.

whether they are genuine physical system, and to estimate the ages for the

the G-APD depends on the flux of night-sky background photons significantly
varying with ambient light conditions. Methods have been developed to keep the

  state","7 pages, 5 figures",,,,"cond-mat.str-el","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We investigate theoretically nonequilibrium quantum transport in a quantum
dot attached to a Majorana bound state. Our approach is based on the Keldysh
Green's function formalism, which allows us to investigate the electric current
continuously from the zero-bias limit up to the large bias regime. In
particular, our findings fully agree with previous results in the literature
that calculate transport using linear response theory (zero-bias) or the master
equation (high bias). Our $I-V$ curves reveal a characteristic slope given by
$I=(G_{0}/2)V$ in linear response regime, where $G_0$ is the ballistic
conductance $e^{2}/h$ as predicted in Phys. Rev. B 84, 201308(R) (2011).
Deviations from this behavior is also discussed when the dot couples
asymmetrically to both left and right leads. The differential conductance
obtained from the left or the right currents can be larger or smaller than
$G_{0}/2$ depending on the strength of the coupling asymmetry. In particular,
the standard conductance derived from the Landauer-B\""{u}ttiker equation in
linear response regime does not agree with the full nonequilibrium calculation,
when the two leads couple asymmetrically to the quantum dot. We also compare
the current through the quantum dot coupled to a regular fermionic (RF)
zero-mode or to a Majorana bound state (MBS). The results differ considerably
for the entire bias voltage range analyzed. Additionally, we observe the
formation of a plateau in the characteristic $I-V$ curve for intermediate bias
voltages when the dot is coupled to a MBS. Thermal effects are also considered.
We note that when the temperature of the reservoirs is large enough both RF and
MBS cases coincide for all bias voltages.

the solutions for the statistics parameters $g,q$ exist in the whole domain of

relativity and quantum nonlocality? The possibility of an affirmative answer is
of great importance to deterministic approaches to quantum mechanics given
recent developments towards generalizations of Bell's theorem. By
generalizations of Bell's theorem we here mean efforts that seek to demonstrate
the impossibility of any deterministic theories to obey the predictions of
Bell's theorem, including even nonlocal hidden-variables theories such as de
Broglie-Bohm theory. The present work offers arguments showing why such efforts
towards generalization may fall short of their stated goal. In particular, we
reject the use of the non-signalling theorem as an argument against the logical
possibility of deterministic quantum theories. We proceed by presenting an
entirely informal treatment of key physical and metaphysical assumptions, and
of their interrelationship, in attempts seeking to generalize Bell's theorem on
the basis of an ontic, foundational interpretation of the non-signalling
theorem. We here argue that the non-signalling theorem must instead be viewed
as an epistemic, phenomenological, or operational theorem i.e. one that refers
exclusively to what epistemic agents can, or rather cannot, do. That is, we
emphasize that the non-signalling theorem is a theorem about the operational
inability of epistemic agents, e.g. human observers, to signal information. A
major reason in favor of our conclusion is that any definition of signalling or
of non-signalling invariably requires a reference to epistemic agents, and what
these agents can actually measure and report; otherwise, the non-signalling
theorem would equal a general ""no-influence"" theorem.

priori energy estimates. Second, at the algebraic level, one can avoid
computing such an auxiliary variable if this is approximated by a piecewise
constant finite-element space. Therefore, these two steps give rise to a
numerical algorithm that computes separately only the primary variables.

the Gerstenhaber bracket in Hochschild cohomology to certain exact and monoidal
categories. Therefore we establish an explicit description of an isomorphism by
A. Neeman and V. Retakh, which links $\mathrm{Ext}$-groups with fundamental
groups of categories of extensions and relies on expressing the fundamental
group of a (small) category by means of the associated Quillen groupoid.
  As a main result, we show that our construction behaves well with respect to
structure preserving functors between exact monoidal categories. We use our
main result to conclude, that both the Lie bracket and the squaring map in
Hochschild cohomology are invariants under Morita equivalence. For
quasi-triangular bialgebras, we further determine a significant part of the Lie
bracket's kernel, and thereby prove a conjecture by L. Menichi. Along the way,
we introduce $n$-extension closed and entirely extension closed subcategories
of abelian categories, and study some of their properties.

front particles in a nonlinear lattice slab and subsequently one monitors the
excited wave evolution using molecular dynamics simulations. This allows for a
simultaneous, direct determination of the existence of the phonon mean free
path with its corresponding anharmonic phonon wavenumber as a function of
temperature. The concept for the mean free path is very distinct from known
prior approaches: the latter evaluate the mean free path only indirectly, via
using both, a scale for the phonon relaxation time and yet another one for the
phonon velocity. Notably, the concept here is neither limited to small lattice
nonlinearities nor to small frequencies. The scheme is tested for three
strongly nonlinear lattices of timely current interest which either exhibit
normal or anomalous heat transport.

  Discretizations","29 pages",,,,"math.NA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper considers a large class of linear operator equations, including
linear boundary value problems for partial differential equations, and treats
them as linear recovery problems for objects from their data. Well-posedness of
the problem means that this recovery is continuous. Discretization recovers
restricted trial objects from restricted test data, and it is well-posed or
stable, if this restricted recovery is continuous. After defining a general
framework for these notions, this paper proves that all well-posed linear
problems have stable and refinable computational discretizations with a
stability that is determined by the well-posedness of the problem and
independent of the computational discretization. The solutions of discretized
problems converge when enlarging the trial spaces, and the convergence rate is
determined by how well the full data of the object solving the full problem can
be approximated by the full data of the trial objects. %of the discretization.
This allows very simple proofs of convergence rates for generalized finite
elements, symmetric and unsymmetric Kansa-type collocation, and other meshfree
methods like Meshless Local Petrov-Galerkin techniques. It is also shown that
for a fixed trial space, weak formulations have a slightly better convergence
rate than strong formulations, but at the expense of numerical integration.
Since convergence rates are reduced to those coming from Approximation Theory,
and since trial spaces are arbitrary, this also covers various spectral and
pseudospectral methods. All of this is illustrated by examples.

on small scales. The classical framework describing the flow field around a
particle swimming by self-diffusiophoresis neglects the advection of the solute
field by the flow and assumes that the chemical interaction layer is thin
compared to the particle size. In this paper we quantify and characterize the
effect of solute advection on the phoretic swimming of a sphere. We first
rigorously derive the regime of validity of the thin-interaction layer
assumption at finite values of the P\'eclet number (Pe). Within this
assumption, we solve computationally the flow around Janus phoretic particles
and examine the impact of solute advection on propulsion and the flow created
by the particle. We demonstrate that although advection always leads to a
decrease of the swimming speed and flow stresslet at high values of the
P\'eclet number, an increase can be obtained at intermediate values of Pe. This
possible enhancement of swimming depends critically on the nature of the
chemical interactions between the solute and the surface. We then derive an
asymptotic analysis of the problem at small Pe allowing to rationalize our
computational results. Our computational and theoretical analysis is
accompanied by a parallel study of the role of reactive effects at the surface
of the particle on swimming (Damk\""ohler number).

are not currently very strong. We aim to constrain the mass profile, M(r), and
dynamical status of the $z \sim 0.8$ LCDCS 0504 cluster of galaxies
characterized by prominent giant gravitational arcs near its center. Our
analysis is based on deep X-ray, optical, and infrared imaging, as well as
optical spectroscopy. We model the mass distribution of the cluster with three
different mass density profiles, whose parameters are constrained by the strong
lensing features of the inner cluster region, by the X-ray emission from the
intra-cluster medium, and by the kinematics of 71 cluster members. We obtain
consistent M(r) determinations from three methods (dispersion-kurtosis,
caustics and MAMPOSSt), out to the cluster virial radius and beyond. The mass
profile inferred by the strong lensing analysis in the central cluster region
is slightly above, but still consistent with, the kinematics estimate. On the
other hand, the X-ray based M(r) is significantly below both the kinematics and
strong lensing estimates. Theoretical predictions from $\Lambda$CDM cosmology
for the concentration--mass relation are in agreement with our observational
results, when taking into account the uncertainties in both the observational
and theoretical estimates. There appears to be a central deficit in the
intra-cluster gas mass fraction compared to nearby clusters. Despite the
relaxed appearance of this cluster, the determinations of its mass profile by
different probes show substantial discrepancies, the origin of which remains to
be determined. The extension of a similar dynamical analysis to other clusters
of the DAFT/FADA survey will allow to shed light on the possible systematics
that affect the determination of mass profiles of high-z clusters, possibly
related to our incomplete understanding of intracluster baryon physics.

Soszynski et al. (2008) had identified as a candidate system for containing two
classical Cepheids in orbit. Our spectroscopic data clearly demonstrate binary
motion of the Cepheids in a 413-day eccentric orbit, rendering this eclipsing
binary system the first ever known to consist of two classical Cepheid
variables. After disentangling the four different radial velocity variations in
the system we present the orbital solution and the individual pulsational
radial velocity curves of the Cepheids. We show that both Cepheids are
extremely likely to be first overtone pulsators and determine their respective
dynamical masses, which turn out to be equal to within 1.5 %. Since the
secondary eclipse is not observed in the orbital light curve we cannot derive
the individual radii of the Cepheids, but the sum of their radii derived from
the photometry is consistent with overtone pulsation for both variables.
  The existence of two equal-mass Cepheids in a binary system having different
pulsation periods (1.96 and 2.48 days, respectively) may pose an interesting
challenge to stellar evolution and pulsation theories, and a more detailed
study of this system using additional datasets should yield deeper insight
about the physics of stellar evolution of Cepheid variables. Future analysis of
the system using additional near-infrared photometry might also lead to a
better understanding of the systematic uncertainties in current Baade-Wesselink
techniques of distance determinations to Cepheid variables.

carriers in graphene-based nanostructures in the low-energy regime. The
magnetic response of such systems results both, frombulk contributions and from
confinement effects that can be particularly strong in ballistic quantum dots.
First we provide a comprehensive study of the magnetic susceptibility $\chi$ of
bulk graphene in a magnetic field for the different regimes arising from the
relative magnitudes of the energy scales involved, i.e. temperature, Landau
level spacing and chemical potential. We show that for finite temperature or
chemical potential, $\chi$ is not divergent although the diamagnetic
contribution $\chi_{0}$ from the filled valance band exhibits the well-known
$-B^{-1/2}$ dependence. We further derive oscillatory modulations of $\chi$,
corresponding to de Haas-van Alphen oscillations of conventional
two-dimensional electron gases. These oscillations can be large in graphene,
thereby compensating the diamagnetic contribution $\chi_{0}$ and yielding a net
paramagnetic susceptibility for certain energy and magnetic field regimes.
Second, we predict and analyze corresponding strong, confinement-induced
susceptibility oscillations in graphene-based quantum dots with amplitudes
distincly exceeding the corresponding bulk susceptibility. Within a
semiclassical approach we derive generic expressions for orbital magnetism of
graphene quantum dots with regular classical dynamics. Graphene-specific
features can be traced back to pseudospin interference along the underlying
periodic orbits. We demonstrate the quality of the semiclassical approximation
by comparison with quantum mechanical results for two exemplary mesoscopic
systems, a graphene disk with infinite mass-type edges and a rectangular
graphene structure with armchair and zigzag edges, using numerical
tight-binding calculations in the latter case.

several novel internet-based projects ask volunteers with little to no training
to identify craters, and it was unclear how their results compare against the
typical professional researcher. To better understand the variation among
experts and to compare with volunteers, eight professional researchers have
identified impact features in two separate regions of the moon. Small craters
(diameters ranging from 10 m to 500 m) were measured on a lunar mare region and
larger craters (100s m to a few km in diameter) were measured on both lunar
highlands and maria. Volunteer data were collected for the small craters on the
mare. Our comparison shows that the level of agreement among experts depends on
crater diameter, number of craters per diameter bin, and terrain type, with
differences of up to $\sim\pm45%$. We also found artifacts near the minimum
crater diameter that was studied. These results indicate that caution must be
used in most cases when interpreting small variations in crater size-frequency
distributions and for craters $\le10$ pixels across. Because of the natural
variability found, projects that emphasize many people identifying craters on
the same area and using a consensus result are likely to yield the most
