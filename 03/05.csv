dynamical system -- which we refer to as semi-invertible cocycles -- this

which cuts the flux term of the momentum is studied. We show numerically that
this penalization creates a Dirac measure at the plasma-limiter interface which

Hence, a new penalty method is proposed for this hyperbolic system. For this

changes the energy of the system by the quasiparticle energy. But the number of

contributions to the total energy of the system--which are not taken into
account in the standard formalism--led us to a redefinition of the
quasiparticle energies and of the quasiparticle populations by the usual method
of the maximization of the superconductor partition function. The result of
this correction is a critical temperature which is lower than the BCS critical
temperature and a finite jump of the energy gap at the phase transition. The
discontinuity of the energy gap at the critical temperature marks a first order
phase transition which is also in disagreement with the standard BCS
interpretation. The fact that the standard BCS formalism is theoretically
inconsistent is revealed in the calculation of the heat capacity and of the

and non-geometric settings (e.g. the breakthrough of Bansal-Pruhs (FOCS 2010)
reduces a wide class of machine scheduling problems to weighted geometric
set-cover). More than two decades of research has succeeded in settling the
$(1+\epsilon)$-approximability status for most geometric set-cover problems,
except for four basic scenarios which are still lacking. One is that of
weighted disks in the plane for which, after a series of papers, Varadarajan
(STOC 2010) presented a clever \emph{quasi-sampling} technique, which together
with improvements by Chan \etal~(SODA 2012), yielded a $O(1)$-approximation
algorithm. Even for the unweighted case, a PTAS for a fundamental class of
objects called pseudodisks (which includes disks, unit-height rectangles,
translates of convex sets etc.) is currently unknown. Another fundamental case
is weighted halfspaces in $\Re^3$, for which a PTAS is currently lacking. In
this paper, we present a QPTAS for all of these remaining problems. Our results
are based on the separator framework of Adamaszek-Wiese (FOCS 2013, SODA 2014),
who recently obtained a QPTAS for weighted independent set of polygonal
regions. This rules out the possibility that these problems are APX-hard,
assuming $\textbf{NP} \nsubseteq \textbf{DTIME}(2^{polylog(n)})$. Together with
the recent work of Chan-Grant (CGTA 2014), this settles the APX-hardness status

one for buy market orders and minus one for sell market orders, displays a very
slowly decaying autocorrelation function. Since orders impact prices,
reconciling the persistence of the order flow with market efficiency is a
subtle issue. A possible solution is provided by asymmetric liquidity, which
states that the impact of a buy or sell order is inversely related to the
probability of its occurrence. We empirically find that when the order flow
predictability increases in one direction, the liquidity in the opposite side
decreases, but the probability that a trade moves the price decreases
significantly. While the last mechanism is able to counterbalance the
persistence of order flow and restore efficiency and diffusivity, the first
acts in opposite direction. We introduce a statistical order book model where
the persistence of the order flow is mitigated by adjusting the market order
volume to the predictability of the order flow. The model reproduces the
diffusive behaviour of prices at all time scales without fine-tuning the values
of parameters, as well as the behaviour of most order book quantities as a
function of the local predictability of order flow.

abundant economic data leads to the development of novel analytic and
computational tools for modelling and forecasting key economic indicators. The
main idea is to introduce a topological component into the analysis, taking
into account consistently all higher-order interactions. We present three basic
methodologies to demonstrate different approaches to harness the resulting
network gain. First, a multiple linear regression optimisation algorithm is
used to generate a relational network between individual components of national
balance of payment accounts. This model describes annual statistics with a high
accuracy and delivers good forecasts for the majority of indicators. Second, an
early-warning mechanism for global financial crises is presented, which
combines network measures with standard economic indicators. From the analysis
of the cross-border portfolio investment network of long-term debt securities,
the proliferation of a wide range of over-the-counter-traded financial
derivative products, such as credit default swaps, can be described in terms of
gross-market values and notional outstanding amounts, which are associated with
increased levels of market interdependence and systemic risk. Third,
considering the flow-network of goods traded between G-20 economies, network
statistics provide better proxies for key economic measures than conventional
indicators. For example, it is shown that a country's gate-keeping potential,
as a measure for local power, projects its annual change of GDP generally far
better than the volume of its imports or exports.

increasing function of the coefficient of risk aversion only if the elasticity
of intertemporal substitution (EIS) exceeds unity. This result, which was first

precise measurements of cosmological distances and the growth rate of cosmic

tension between the constraints set by growth data and those from distances. In
the disformally coupled Galileon model, we obtain better agreement with data

sequences, and hidden states are added to the model, however, the runtime of

demonstrate that the linear-time method can reconstruct a population size

oscillation in the X-ray light curve of the accreting millisecond pulsar XTE

They noted that a possible explanation includes the excitation of a non-radial
oscillation mode of the neutron star, either in the form of a g-mode or an
r-mode. The r-mode interpretation has connections with proposed spin-evolution
scenarios for systems such as XTE J1751-305. Here we examine in detail this
interesting possible interpretation. Using the ratio of the observed
oscillation frequency to the star's spin frequency, we derive an approximate
neutron star mass-radius relation which yields reasonable values for the mass
over the range of expected stellar radius (as constrained by observations of
radius-expansion burst sources). However, we argue that the large mode
amplitude suggested by the Strohmayer and Mahmoodifar analysis would inevitably
lead to a large spin-down of the star, inconsistent with its observed spin
evolution, regardless of whether the r-mode itself is in a stable or unstable
regime. We therefore conclude that the r-mode interpretation of the observed
oscillation is not consistent with our current understanding of neutron star
dynamics and must be considered unlikely. Finally we note that, subject to the
availability of a sufficiently accurate timing model, a direct
gravitational-wave search may be able to confirm or reject an r-mode
interpretation unambiguously, should such an event, with a similar inferred
mode amplitude, recur during the Advanced detector era.

light axion-like scalar is suggested as a natural candidate for dark matter and
its production mechanisms are closely examined. We show that the right amount
of axion relic density with the preferred parameters, $m_a \simeq 7 \,{\rm

from the decay of inflaton. If the axions were produced from the saxion decay,
it could not have constituted the total relic density due to the bound from
structure formation. Nonetheless, the saxion decay is an interesting
possibility, because the $3.5\, {\rm keV}$ line and dark radiation can be
addressed simultaneously, being consistent with the Planck data. Small
misalignment angles of the axion, ranging between $\theta_a\sim 10^{-4}
-10^{-1}$ depending on the reheating temperature, can also be the source of
axion production. The model with axion misalignment can satisfy the constraints
for structure formation and iso-curvature perturbation.

then applied at three points along the front located between $2.2-2.6$

(by $\sim 46^\circ$), plasma compression (factor $\sim 2.7$) and heating
(factor $\sim 12$) occur at the nose, while heating at the flanks is more
moderate (factor $1.5-3.0$). Starting from a pre-shock corona where protons and
electrons have about the same temperature ($T_p \sim T_e \sim 1.5 \cdot 10^6$
K), temperature increases derived with RH equations could better represent the
protons heating (by dissipation across the shock), while the temperature
increase implied by adiabatic compression (factor $\sim 2$ at the nose, $\sim
1.2-1.5$ at the flanks) could be more representative of electrons heating: the
transit of the shock causes a decoupling between electron and proton
temperatures. Derived magnetic field vector rotations imply a draping of field
lines around the expanding flux rope. The shock turns out to be super-critical
(sub-critical) at the nose (at the flanks), where derived post-shock plasma
parameters can be very well approximated with those derived by assuming a
parallel (perpendicular) shock.

concise mathematical understanding. Conceptual models that capture some
relevant aspects of the process exist but their full explanatory power is not

which defines the conditions for stable locomotion when steps are taken with
imprecise angle of attack. Intuitively, the necessity of a higher precision
indicates the difficulty to continue moving with a given gait. We show that the
spring-loaded inverted pendulum model, under the robustness criterion, is
consistent with previously reported findings on attentional demand during human
locomotion. This criterion allows transitions between running and walking, many
of which conserve forward speed. Simulations of transitions predict Froude
numbers below the ones observed in humans, nevertheless the model
satisfactorily reproduces several biomechanical indicators such as hip
excursion, gait duty factor and vertical ground reaction force profiles.
Furthermore, we identify reversible robust walk-run transitions, which allow
the system to execute a robust version of the hopping gait. These findings
foster the spring-loaded inverted pendulum model as the unifying framework for
the understanding of bipedal locomotion.

described here are characterized by the presence of records of observation
throughout their history, so that the detection rate corresponds to directly
measurable quantities. This is in contrast to past treatments of detectors,
which actually refer to probes, i.e., microscopic systems from which we extract
information only after their interaction has been completed. Our treatment
incorporates the irreversibility due to the creation of macroscopic records of
observation. The key result is a real-time description of particle detection
and a rigorously defined time-local probability density function (PDF). The PDF
depends on the scale $\sigma$ of the temporal coarse-graining that is necessary
for the formation of a macroscopic record. The evaluation of the PDF for
Unruh-DeWitt detectors along different types of trajectory shows that only
paths with at least one characteristic time-scale much smaller than $\sigma$
lead to appreciable particle detection. Our approach allows for averaging over

two conjectures stating that certain partitions are optimal with respect to

statements concerning partitions to sets of equal measure. However, they
indicate that if these conjectures are true, their veracity and their proofs

flush-mounted rigid discs are studied by means of direct numerical simulations.
The Reynolds number is $R_\tau$=$180$, based on the friction velocity of the
stationary-wall case and the half channel height. The primary effect of the
wall forcing is the sustained reduction of wall-shear stress, which reaches a
maximum of 20%. A parametric study on the disc diameter, maximum tip velocity,
and oscillation period is presented, with the aim to identify the optimal
parameters which guarantee maximum drag reduction and maximum net energy
saving, computed by taking into account the power spent to actuate the discs.
This may be positive and reaches 6%.
  The Rosenblat viscous pump flow is used to predict the power spent for disc
motion in the turbulent channel flow and to estimate localized and transient
regions over the disc surface subjected to the turbulent regenerative braking
effect, for which the wall turbulence exerts work on the discs.
  The FIK identity is employed to show that the wall-friction reduction is due
to two distinguished effects. One effect is linked to the direct shearing
action of the near-wall oscillating disc boundary layer on the wall turbulence,
which causes the attenuation of the turbulent Reynolds stresses. The other
effect is due the additional disc-flow Reynolds stresses produced by the
inter-disc structures.
  The contribution to drag reduction due to turbulent Reynolds stress
attenuation depends on the penetration thickness of the disc-flow boundary
layer, while the contribution due to the elongated structures scales linearly
with a simple function of the maximum tip velocity and oscillation period for
the largest disc diameter tested, a result suggested by the Rosenblat flow
solution. A brief discussion on the future applicability of the
oscillating-disc technique is also presented.

use in algorithms that arise from a discrete variational principle on
phase-space dynamics. Dynamical systems described by degenerate Lagrangians,
such as those occurring in phase-space action principles, lead to variational
multistep algorithms for the integration of first-order differential equations.
As multistep algorithms, an initialization procedure must be chosen and the
stability of parasitic modes assessed. The conventional selection of initial
conditions using accurate one-step methods does not yield the best numerical
performance for smoothness and stability. Instead, backward error
initialization identifies a set of initial conditions that minimize the
amplitude of undesirable parasitic modes. This issue is especially important in
the context of structure-preserving multistep algorithms where numerical
damping of the parasitic modes would violate the conservation properties. In
the presence of growing parasitic modes, the algorithm may also be periodically
re-initialized to prevent the undesired mode from reaching large amplitude.
Numerical examples of variational multistep algorithms are presented in which
the backward error initialized trajectories outperform those initialized using
highly accurate approximations of the true solution.

with the $\Lambda$CDM predictions. Moreover data favor models predicting
slightly less growth of structures than the Planck LambdaCDM scenario. The main
aim of the paper is to provide a prescription for routinely calculating, in an
analytic way, the amplitude of the growth indices $\gamma_i$ in relevant
cosmological scenarios, and to show that these parameters naturally define a
space where predictions of alternative theories of gravity can be compared
against growth data in a manner which is independent from the expansion history
of the cosmological background. As the standard $\Omega$-plane provides a tool
to identify different expansion histories $H(t)$ and their relation to various
cosmological models, the $\gamma$-plane can thus be used to locate different
growth rate histories $f(t)$ and their relation to alternatives model of
gravity. As a result, we find that the Dvali-Gabadadze-Porrati gravity model is
rejected with a $95\%$ confidence level. By simulating future data sets, such

X-ray flares extends to high energy, with no evidence for a cut off. Although

simple physical models in an attempt to identify the main X-ray emission
mechanism, but the data do not allow us to significantly discriminate between
them. However, we confirm the previous finding that the parameters obtained
with synchrotron models are, for the X-ray emission, physically more reasonable

model is able to approximate the fundamental features of the climate obtained
from three-dimensional (3D) atmospheric general circulation model (GCM)
simulations. One important reason for the two-column model's success is that it
reproduces the high cloud albedo of the GCM simulations, which reduces the
planet's temperature and delays the onset of a runaway greenhouse state. The
two-column model also clearly illustrates a secondary mechanism for determining
the climate: the nightside acts as a ``radiator fin'' through which infrared
energy can be lost to space easily. This radiator fin is maintained by a
temperature inversion and dry air on the nightside, and plays a similar role to
the subtropics on modern Earth. Since 1D radiative-convective models cannot
capture the effects of the cloud albedo and radiator fin, they are
systematically biased towards a narrower habitable zone. We also show that
cloud parameters are most important for determining the day--night thermal
emission contrast in the two-column model, which decreases and eventually
reverses as the stellar flux increases. This reversal is important because it
could be detected by future extrasolar planet characterization missions, which
would suggest that the planet has Earth-like water clouds and is potentially
habitable.

including those with jumping kernels exponentially and subexponentially
localized at infinity. For a large class of L\'evy measures, non-necessarily
symmetric nor absolutely continuous with respect to the Lebesgue measure, we
find the optimal, both in time and space, upper bound for the corresponding
transition kernels at infinity. In case of L\'evy measures that are symmetric
and absolutely continuous, with densities $g$ such that $g(x) \asymp f(|x|)$
for nonincreasing profile functions $f$, we also prove the full
characterization of the sharp two-sided transition densities bounds of the form
$$ p_t(x) \asymp h(t)^{-d} \cdot \mathbf{1}_{\left\{|x|\leq \theta
h(t)\right\}} + t \, g(x) \cdot \mathbf{1}_{\left\{|x| \geq \theta

This is done for small and large $x$ separately. Mainly, our argument is based
on new precise upper bounds for convolutions of L\'evy measures. Our
investigations lead to an interesting and surprising dichotomy of the decay
properties at infinity for transition kernels of pure jump L\'evy processes.

UPt$_3$ provide strong evidence for the triplet, chiral $k_z(k_x \pm ik_y)^2$
pairing symmetries, which endow the Cooper pairs with orbital angular momentum
projections $L _z= \pm 2$ along the $c$-axis. In the absence of disorder such
pairing can support both line and point nodes, and both types of nodal
quasiparticles exhibit nontrivial topology in the momentum space. The point
nodes, located at the intersections of the closed Fermi surfaces with the
$c$-axis, act as the double monopoles and the antimonopoles of the Berry
curvature, and generalize the notion of Weyl quasiparticles. Consequently, the
$B$ phase should support an anomalous thermal Hall effect, the polar Kerr
effect, in addition to the protected Fermi arcs on the (1,0,0) and the (0,1,0)
surfaces. The line node at the Fermi surface equator acts as a vortex loop in
the momentum space and gives rise to the zero energy, dispersionless Andreev
bound states on the (0,0,1) surface. At the transition from the $B$-phase to
the $A$-phase, the time reversal symmetry is restored, and only the line node
survives inside the $A$-phase. As both line and double-Weyl point nodes possess
linearly vanishing density of states, we show that weak disorder acts as a
marginally relevant perturbation. Consequently, an infinitesimal amount of
disorder destroys the ballistic quasiparticle pole, while giving rise to a
diffusive phase with a finite density of states at the zero energy. The
resulting diffusive phase exhibits $T$-linear specific heat, and an anomalous
thermal Hall effect. We predict that the low temperature thermodynamic and
transport properties display a crossover between a ballistic thermal Hall
semimetal and a diffusive thermal Hall metal.

boundary along one side, and a free lattice line boundary along the other. We
study the interaction of the gap with the corner as the rest of the angle is
completely filled with lozenges. We show that the resulting correlation is
governed by the product of the distances between the gap and its three images
in the sides of the angle. The image in the side with constrained boundary has
the same orientation as the original gap, while the image in the side with free
boundary has the opposite orientation. This, together with the parallel between
the correlation of gaps in dimer packings and electrostatics we developed in
previous work, provides evidence for a unified way of understanding the
interaction of gaps with the boundary under mixed boundary conditions, which we
phrase as a conjecture. While the electrostatic interpretation is equivalent to
a steady state heat flow interpretation in the bulk, it turns out that the
latter view is more natural in the context of the interaction of the gaps with
the boundary.
  The starting point for our analysis is an exact formula we prove for the
number of lozenge tilings of certain trapezoidal regions with mixed boundary
conditions, which is equivalent to a new, multi-parameter generalization of a
classical plane partition enumeration problem (that of enumerating symmetric,
self-complementary plane partitions).

that cooperation is not always beneficial. Based on this analysis, we propose

negative Poisson's ratio, negative thermal expansion, and holographic
elasticity, and have many interesting applications in engineering. However, it
is a grand challenge to self-assemble open structures at the colloidal scale,
where short-range interactions and low coordination number can leave them
mechanically unstable. In this paper we discuss the self-assembly of open
structures using triblock Janus particles, which have two large attractive
patches that can form multiple bonds, separated by a band with purely
hard-sphere repulsion. Such surface patterning leads to open structures that
are stabilized by orientational entropy (in an order-by-disorder effect) and
selected over close-packed structures by vibrational entropy. For different
patch sizes the particles can form into either tetrahedral or octahedral
structural motifs which then compose open lattices, including the pyrochlore,
the hexagonal tetrastack and the perovskite lattices. Using an analytic theory,
we examine the phase diagrams of these possible open and close-packed
structures for triblock Janus particles and characterize the mechanical
properties of these structures. Our theory leads to rational designs of
particles for the self-assembly of three-dimensional colloidal structures that
are possible using current experimental techniques.

halo in SEGUE/SDSS data, and trace them back to improper error treatment and
neglect of selection effects. In particular, the detection of a vertical
abundance gradient in the halo can be explained as a metallicity bias in
distance. A similar bias, and the impact of disk contamination, affect the
sample of blue horizontal branch stars. These examples highlight why non-volume
complete samples require forward-modelling from theoretical models or extensive
bias-corrections. We also show how observational uncertainties produce the
specific non-Gaussianity in the observed azimuthal velocity distribution of
halo stars, which can be erroneously identified as two Gaussian components. A
single kinematic component yields an excellent fit to the observed data, when
we model the measurement process including distance uncertainties. Furthermore,
we show that sample differences in proper motion space are the direct
consequence of kinematic cuts, and are enhanced when distance estimates are
less accurate. Thus, their presence is neither a proof for a separate
population, nor a measure of reliability for the applied distances. We conclude
that currently there is no evidence from SEGUE/SDSS that would favour a dual
Galactic halo over a single halo full of substructure.

which become entirely radial near the horizon are not expelled by the Meissner

natural example is a split-monopole field. We stress that ordinary
Blandford-Znajek jets are impossible if the Meissner effect operates and expels
the field. Finally, we note that in our general relativistic
magnetohydrodynamic simulations of black hole jets, there is no evidence that
jets are quenched by the Meissner effect. The simulated jets develop a large
split monopole component spontaneously which supports our proposal for how the
Meissner effect is evaded and jets from rapidly rotating black holes are

J1910.2-0546 is a candidate black hole low-mass X-ray binary that was
discovered in 2012 when it entered an accretion outburst. To investigate the
binary configuration and the accretion morphology we monitored the evolution of
the outburst for ~3 months at X-ray, UV, optical (B,V,R,I), and near-infrared
(J,H,K) wavelengths using Swift and SMARTS. The source evolved from a hard to a
soft X-ray spectral state with a relatively cold accretion disk that peaked at
~0.5 keV. A Chandra/HETG spectrum obtained during this soft state did not
reveal signatures of an ionized disk wind. Both the low disk temperature and
the absence of a detectable wind could indicate that the system is viewed at
relatively low inclination. The multi-wavelength light curves revealed two
notable features that appear to be related to X-ray state changes. Firstly, a
prominent flux decrease was observed in all wavebands ~1-2 weeks before the
source entered the soft state. This dip occurred in (0.6-10 keV) X-rays ~6 days
later than at longer wavelengths, which could possibly reflect the viscous time
scale of the disk. Secondly, about two weeks after the source transitioned back
into the hard state, the UV emission significantly increased while the X-rays
steadily decayed. We discuss how these observations may reflect changes in the
accretion flow morphology, perhaps related to the quenching/launch of a jet or
the collapse/recovery of a hot flow.

semi-numerical techniques: one using the same halos as ${\rm C}^2$-RAY as its

These are vastly more computationally efficient than ${\rm C}^2$-RAY, but use
more simplistic physical assumptions. We evaluate these simulations in terms of

that both Sem-Num and CPS+GS can produce an ionization history and morphology

with galaxy impact parameters ranging from 35 proper kpc (pkpc) to 2 proper Mpc
(pMpc). Using the pixel optical depth technique, we present the first
galaxy-centred 2-D maps of the median absorption by OVI, NV, CIV, CIII, and
SIV, as well as updated results for HI. At small galactocentric radii we detect
a strong enhancement of the absorption relative to randomly located regions
that extend out to at least 180 pkpc in the transverse direction, and $\pm$240
km/s along the line-of-sight (LOS, ~1 pMpc in the case of pure Hubble flow) for
all ions except NV. For CIV (and HI) we detect a significant enhancement of the
absorption signal out to 2 pMpc in the transverse direction, corresponding to
the maximum impact parameter in our sample. After normalising the median
absorption profiles to account for variations in line strengths and detection
limits, in the transverse direction we find no evidence for a sharp drop-off in
metals distinct from that of HI. We argue instead that non-detection of some
metal line species in the extended circumgalactic medium is consistent with
differences in the detection sensitivity. We also present measurements of
covering fractions and equivalent widths as a function of projected galaxy
distance. Limiting the sample to the 340 galaxies with redshifts measured from
nebular emission lines does not decrease the extent of the enhancement along
the LOS compared to that in the transverse direction. This rules out redshift
errors as the source of the observed redshift-space anisotropy and thus implies
that we have detected the signature of gas peculiar velocities from infall,
outflows, or virial motions for HI, OVI, CIV, CIII, and CIV.

these criteria at hand, we reproduce the tenfold classification table of
integer topological insulators, where their stability against interactions
becomes immediately transparent in the Luttinger liquid description. Second, we
construct an example of a strongly interacting fermionic topological phase of
matter with short-range entanglement that lies outside of the tenfold
classification. Third, we expand the table to long-range entangled topological
phases with intrinsic topological order and fractional excitations.

achieves a symmetric rate which is within a constant number of bits to the
minimum of the symmetric capacity with infinite feedback, and the sum of the

constant is obtained as a function of the number of users, $K$. The symmetric
achievable rate is used to characterize the achievable generalized degrees of

a total set of 78 pairs of equivalent width measurements for 46 BAL RLQs,
probing rest-frame timescales of ~80-6000 d (median 500 d). In general, only
modest changes in the depths of segments of absorption troughs are observed,
akin to those seen in prior studies of BAL RQQs. Also similar to previous
findings for RQQs, the RLQs studied here are more likely to display BAL
variability on longer rest-frame timescales. However, typical values of
|Delta_EW| and |Delta_EW|/<EW> are about 40+/-20% lower for BAL RLQs when
compared with those of a timescale-matched sample of BAL RQQs. Optical
continuum variability is of similar amplitude in BAL RLQs and BAL RQQs; for
both RLQs and RQQs, continuum variability tends to be stronger on longer
timescales. BAL variability in RLQs does not obviously depend upon their radio
luminosities or radio-loudness values, but we do find tentative evidence for
greater fractional BAL variability within lobe-dominated RLQs. Enhanced BAL
variability within more edge-on (lobe-dominated) RLQs supports some geometrical
dependence to the outflow structure.

are separated by structured chaotic windows. By performing a linear regression
on the linear part of the data, a fractal dimension of D = 0.868 is obtained,
with an uncertainty of +-0.012. The chaotic regions exhibit scaling similarity
and it is shown that the devil's staircase of the system can form a backbone

staircases. The onset of chaos for subharmonic steps occurs through the
Feigenbaum period doubling scenario. Universality in the sequence of periodic

Josephson junction parameters on the structured chaos is investigated and it is
concluded that the structured chaos is a stable formation over a wide range of

spin-glass on scale-free networks. For this purpose, we consider the
Ghatak-Sherrington (GS) model, a spin-1 spin-glass model with a crystal field,
instead of the usual Ising-type model. Scale-free networks on which the GS
model is placed are constructed from the static model, in which the number of
vertices is fixed from the beginning. On the basis of the replica-symmetric
solution, we obtain the analytical solutions, i.e., free energy and order
parameters, and we derive the various phase diagrams consisting of the
paramagnetic, ferromagnetic, and spin glass phases as functions of temperature
$T$, the degree exponent $\lambda$, the mean degree $K$, and the fraction of
the ferromagnetic interactions $\rho$. Since the present model is based on the
GS model, which considers the three states ($S=0, \pm 1$), the $S=0$ state
plays a crucial role in the $\lambda$-dependent critical behavior: glass
transition temperature $T_{g}$ has a finite value, even when $2 < \lambda < 3$.
In addition, when the crystal field becomes nonzero, the present model clearly
exhibits three types of inverse transitions, which occur when an ordered phase
is more entropic than a disordered one.

Rousset [1] to take surface tension into account. Due to the presence of
boundary layers, we are unable to pass to the zero-viscosity limit in the usual
Sobolev spaces. Indeed, as viscosity tends to zero, normal derivatives at the
boundary should blow-up. To deal with this problem, we solve the free boundary
problem in the so-called Sobolev co-normal spaces (after fixing the boundary
via a coordinate transformation). We prove estimates which are uniform in the
viscosity. And after inviscid limit process, we get the local existence of
free-boundary Euler equation with surface tension. One of the main differences
between this work and the work [1] is our use of time-derivative estimates and
certain properties of the Dirichlet-Neumann operator. In a forthcoming work, we
discuss how we can take the simultaneous limit of zero viscosity and surface
tension [].

connectivity properties of the network. One such mobile network that has drawn
attention of researchers in the past few years is the Airborne Networks (AN)
due to its importance in civil and military purpose and due to the several
complex issues in these domains. Since the nodes in an airborne network (AN)
are heterogeneous and mobile, the design of a reliable and robust AN is highly
complex and challenging. In this paper a persistent backbone based architecture
for an AN has been considered where a set of airborne networking platforms
(ANPs - aircrafts, UAVs and satellites) form the backbone of the AN. End to end
connectivity of the backbone nodes is crucial in providing the communication
among the hosts. Since ANPs are prone to failure because of attacks like EMP
attack or jamming, another important issue is to improve the robustness of the
backbone network against these attacks. Such attacks will impact specific
geographic regions at specific times and if an ANP is within the fault region
during the time of attack, it will fail. This paper focuses on connectivity and
fault-tolerance issues in ANs and studies algorithms to compute the minimum
transmission range of ANPs in fault free and faulty scenarios to ensure network
connectivity all the times. It also considers the scenario where the network
may have to operate in a disconnected mode for some part of time and data
transmissions may be tolerant to some amount of delay. Hence, ANPs may not need
to have end-to-end paths all the time but they should be able to transmit data
to each other within bounded time.

consists of the sum of the attractor position distances known as supercycle
diameters and the associated thermodynamic potential measures the rate of
approach of trajectories to the attractor. The configurational weights for
finite $2^{N}$, and infinite $N \rightarrow \infty $, periods can be expressed
as power laws or deformed exponentials. For finite period the structure is
undeveloped in the sense that there is no true configurational degeneracy, but
in the limit $N\rightarrow \infty $ this is realized together with the analog
property of a Legendre transform linking entropies of two ensembles. We also
study the partition functions for all $N$ and the action of the Central Limit

physical properties and kinematics of G0.253+0.016. Recent Herschel data show
that while the dust temperature is low (~19 K) toward its centre, the dust
temperature on the exterior is higher (~27 K) due to external heating. Our new
molecular line data reveal that, overall, the morphology of dense gas detected
toward G0.253+0.016 matches very well its IR extinction and dust continuum
emission. An anti-correlation between the dust and gas column densities toward
its centre indicates that the clump is centrally condensed with a cold, dense
interior in which the molecular gas is chemically depleted. The velocity field
shows a strong gradient along the clump's major axis, with the blue-shifted
side at higher Galactic longitude. The optically thick gas tracers are
systematically red-shifted with respect to the optically thin and hot gas
tracers, indicating radial motions. The gas kinematics and line ratios support
the recently proposed scenario in which G0.253+0.016 results from a tidal
compression during a recent pericentre passage near SgrA*. Because G0.253+0.016
represents an excellent example of a clump that may form a high-mass cluster,
its detailed study should reveal a wealth of knowledge about the early stages

either in CO or Hi radio emission, but it is detected by other means including
gamma-rays, dust emission and extinction traced outside the Galactic plane at
|b|>5 degree. In these analyses, the 21-cm HI emission is usually assumed to be
completely optically thin. We have reanalyzed the HI emission from the whole
sky at |b|>15 degree by considering temperature stratification in the ISM
inferred from the Planck/IRAS analysis of the dust properties. The results
indicate that the HI emission is saturated with an optical depth ranging from
0.5 to 3 for 85% of the local HI gas. This optically thick HI is characterized
by spin temperature in the range 10K-60K, significantly lower than previously
postulated in the literature, whereas such low temperature is consistent with
emission/absorption measurements of the cool HI toward radio continuum sources.
The distribution and the column density of the HI are consistent with those of
the dark gas sug- gested by gamma-rays, and it is possible that the dark gas in
the Galaxy is dominated by optically thick cold HI gas. This result implies
that the average density of HI is 2-2.5 times higher than that derived on the
optically-thin assumption in the local ISM.

is not random, but aligned with the major axes of central galaxies. This
alignment is dependent on galaxy properties, such that red satellites are more
strongly aligned than blue satellites. Theoretical work done to interpret this
phenomena has found that it is due to the non-spherical nature of dark matter
halos. However, most studies over-predict the alignment signal under the
assumption that the central galaxy shape follows the shape of the host halo. It
is also not clear whether the color dependence of alignment is due to an
assembly bias or an evolution effect. In this paper we study these problems
using a cosmological N-body simulation. Subhalos are used to trace the
positions of satellite galaxies. It is found that the shape of dark matter
halos are mis-aligned at different radii. If the central galaxy shares the same
shape as the inner host halo, then the alignment effect is weaker and agrees
with observational data. However, it predicts almost no dependence of alignment
on the color of satellite galaxies, though the late accreted subhalos show
stronger alignment with the outer layer of the host halo than their early
accreted counterparts. We find that this is due to the limitation of pure
N-body simulations that satellites galaxies without associated subhalos
('orphan galaxies') are not resolved. These orphan (mostly red) satellites
often reside in the inner region of host halos and should follow the shape of
the host halo in the inner region.

uses the improved results to investigate the asymptotic stability of a class of
switched nonlinear systems.
  Firstly, the strict S-Lemma is extended from quadratic forms to homogeneous
functions with respect to any dilation, where the improved S-Lemma is named the
strict homogeneous S-Lemma (the SHS-Lemma for short). In detail, this paper
indicates that the strict S-Lemma does not necessarily hold for homogeneous
functions that are not quadratic forms, and proposes a necessary and sufficient
condition under which the SHS-Lemma holds.
  It is well known that a switched linear system with two sub-systems admits a
Lyapunov function with homogeneous derivative (LFHD for short), if and only if
it has a convex combination of the vector fields of its two sub-systems that
admits a LFHD. In this paper, it is shown that this conclusion does not
necessarily hold for a general switched nonlinear system with two sub-systems,
and gives a necessary and sufficient condition under which the conclusion holds
for a general switched nonlinear system with two sub-systems. It is also shown
that for a switched nonlinear system with three or more sub-systems, the ""if""
part holds, but the ""only if"" part may not.
  At last, the S-Lemma is extended from quadratic polynomials to polynomials of
degree more than $2$ under some mild conditions, and the improved results are
called the homogeneous S-Lemma (the HS-Lemma for short) and the non-homogeneous
S-Lemma (the NHS-Lemma for short), respectively.
  Besides, some examples and counterexamples are given to illustrate the main
results.

temperatures at 0.2 keV and 0.7 keV, while during the flares a third component
at 0.9 keV is detected. We obtain estimates of the electron density in the
range $n_e = 1.6 - 13 \times 10^{10}$ cm$^{-3}$ and thus the corona of HD189733
A appears denser than the solar one. {For the third time, we observe a large
flare that occurred just after the eclipse of the planet. Together with the
flares observed in 2009 and 2011, the events are restricted to a small
planetary phase range of $\phi = 0.55-0.65$. Although we do not find conclusive
evidence of a significant excess of flares after the secondary transits, we
suggest that the planet might trigger such flares when it passes close to
locally high magnetic field of the underlying star at particular combinations
of stellar rotational phases and orbital planetary phases. For the most recent
flares, a wavelet analysis of the light curve suggests a loop of length of four
stellar radii at the location of the bright flare, and a local magnetic field
of order of 40-100 G, in agreement with the global field measured in other
studies. The loop size suggests an interaction of magnetic nature between
planet and star, separated by only $\sim8 R_*$. We also detect the stellar
companion (HD 189733 B, $\sim12""$ from the primary star) in this XMM
observation. Its very low X-ray luminosity ($L_X = 3.4\times 10^{26}$ erg
s$^{-1}$) confirms the old age of this star and of the binary system. The high
activity of the primary star is best explained by a transfer of angular
momentum from the planet to the star.

planets is its high sensitivity to low-mass planets. However, it is often
believed that microlensing detections of Earth-mass planets from ground-based
observation would be difficult due to the limit set by finite-source effects.
This view comes from the previous estimation of the planet detection
probability based on the fractional deviation of planetary signals, but proper
probability estimation requires to additionally consider the source brightness,
which is directly related to the photometric precision. In this paper, we
reevaluate the feasibility of low-mass planet detections considering
photometric precision for different populations of source stars. From this, it
is found that contribution of the improved photometric precision to the
planetary signal of a giant-source event is big enough to compensate the
decrease of the magnification excess caused by finite-source effects. As a
result, we find that giant-source events are suitable targets for Earth-mass
planet detections with significantly higher detection probability than events
involved with source stars of smaller radii and predict that Earth-mass planets
would be detected by prospective high-cadence surveys.

been observed in electric recordings of brain activity. Recently, Brunel et al.
developed a framework to describe this kind of fast sparse synchronization in
both random and globally-coupled networks of suprathreshold spiking neurons.
However, in a real cortical circuit, synaptic connections are known to have
complex topology which is neither regular nor random. Hence, in order to extend
the works of Brunel et al. to realistic neural networks, we study the effect of
network architecture on these fast sparsely synchronized rhythms in an
inhibitory population of suprathreshold fast spiking (FS) Izhikevich
interneurons. We first employ the conventional Erd\""{o}s-Renyi random graph of
suprathreshold FS Izhikevich interneurons for modeling the complex connectivity
in neural systems, and study emergence of the population synchronized states by
varying both the synaptic inhibition strength $J$ and the noise intensity $D$.
Thus, fast sparsely synchronized states of relatively high degree are found to
appear for large values of $J$ and $D$. Second, for fixed values of $J$ and $D$
where fast sparse synchronization occurs in the random network, we consider the
Watts-Strogatz small-world network of suprathreshold FS Izhikevich interneurons
which interpolates between regular lattice and random graph via rewiring, and
investigate the effect of small-world synaptic connectivity on emergence of
fast sparsely synchronized rhythms by varying the rewiring probability $p$ from
short-range to long-range connection. When passing a small critical value
$p^*_c$ $(\simeq 0.12)$, fast sparsely synchronized population rhythms are
found to emerge in small-world networks with predominantly local connections
and rare long-range connections.

strong interaction of the SN ejecta with the circumstellar medium. Our
late-time radio observations toward SN 2010P probe the dense circumstellar
envelope of this SN, and imply a mass-loss rate (Msun/yr) to wind velocity (in
units of 10 km/s) ratio of (3.0-5.1)E-05, with a 5 GHz peak luminosity of
~1.2E+27 erg/s/Hz on day ~464 after explosion. This is consistent with a Type
IIb classification for SN 2010P, making it the most distant and most slowly
evolving Type IIb radio SN detected to date.

embedded in an otherwise smooth red light distribution by difference imaging in
two bands. The method is automated for efficient application to current and
future surveys, having originally been designed for the 150-deg2 Canada France
Hawaii Telescope Legacy Survey (CFHTLS). We describe each of the steps of

purity. For sources with magnification mu>4, RingFinder reaches 42% (resp. 25%)
completeness and 29% (resp. 86%) purity before (resp. after) visual inspection.
The completeness of RingFinder is substantially improved in the particular
range of Einstein radii 0.8 < REin < 2. and lensed images brighter than g =
22.5, where it can be as high as 70%. RingFinder does not introduce any
significant bias in the source or deflector population. We conclude by

Keck Adaptive Optics high resolution imaging, and with Keck and Very Large

type galaxies have been envisaged through cross correlations, in the mass-size
parametric plane, with high redshift early type galaxies (hereafter ETG).It is
found that the inner most components of nearby ETGs have significant
correlation with ETGs in the highest redshift range called red nuggets whereas
intermediate components are highly correlated with ETGs in the redshift range
with z value greater than 0.5 and less than 0.75. The outer most part has no
correlation in any range, suggesting a scenario through in situ accretion. The
above formation scenario is consistent with the previous results obtained for
NGC5128 (Chattopadhyay et al. (2009), Chattopadhyay et al. (2013)) and to some
extent for nearby elliptical galaxies (Huang et al. (2013)) after considering a
sample of ETGs at high redshift with stellar masses greater than or equal to
108.73 M-Sun. So the present work indicates a three phase formation of massive
nearby elliptical galaxies instead of two as discussed in previous works.

jump, {\Delta}s, determined from the 3D RHD models, are matched with the mixing
length parameter, {\alpha}_MLT, from 1D hydrostatic atmosphere models with
identical microphysics (opacities and equation-of-state). We also derive the
mass mixing length, {\alpha}_m, and the vertical correlation length of the
vertical velocity, C[v_z,v_z], directly from the 3D hydrodynamical simulations
of stellar subsurface convection. The calibrated mixing length parameter for
the Sun is {\alpha}_MLT (s_bot) = 1.98. For different stellar parameters,
{\alpha}_MLT varies systematically in the range of 1.7 - 2.4. In particular,
{\alpha}_MLT decreases towards higher effective temperature, lower surface
gravity and higher metallicity. We find equivalent results for {\alpha}_MLT
({\Delta}s). Also, we find a tight correlation between the mixing length
parameter and the inverse entropy jump. We derive an analytical expression from
the hydrodynamic mean field equations that motivates the relation to the mass
mixing length, {\alpha}_m, and find that it exhibits qualitatively a similar
variation with stellar parameter (between 1.6 and 2.4) with a solar value of
{\alpha}_m = 1.83. The vertical correlation length scaled with the pressure
scale height yields for the Sun 1.71, but displays only a small systematic
variation with stellar parameters, the correlation length slightly increasing
with Teff. We derive mixing length parameters for various stellar parameters
that can be used to replace a constant value. Within any convective envelope,
{\alpha}_m and related quantities vary a lot.

set of basis vectors. The galaxy images are reconstructed using the PCA basis
and subtracted from the data. We then filter the residual image with two
different methods. The first uses a curvelet (curved wavelets) filter of the
residual images to enhance any curved/ring feature. The resulting image is
transformed in polar coordinates, centered on the lens galaxy center. In these
coordinates, a ring is turned into a line, allowing us to detect very faint
rings by taking advantage of the integrated signal-to-noise in the ring (a line
in polar coordinates). The second way of analysing the PCA-subtracted images
identifies structures in the residual images and assesses whether they are
lensed images according to their orientation, multiplicity and elongation. We
apply the two methods to a sample of simulated Einstein rings, as they would be
observed with the ESA Euclid satellite in the VIS band. The polar coordinates
transform allows us to reach a completeness of 90% and a purity of 86%, as soon
as the signal-to-noise integrated in the ring is higher than 30, and almost
independent of the size of the Einstein ring. Finally, we show with real data
that our PCA-based galaxy subtraction scheme performs better than traditional
subtraction based on model fitting to the data. Our algorithm can be developed
and improved further using machine learning and dictionary learning methods,
which would extend the capabilities of the method to more complex and diverse
galaxy shapes.

offers a compelling explanation of the observed galactic substructure;
furthermore, the direct coupling between DM and a light particle contributes to
the DM annihilation in the early universe. If the DM abundance is due to a dark
particle-antiparticle asymmetry, the DM annihilation cross-section can be
arbitrarily large, and the coupling of DM to the light species can be
significant. We consider the case of asymmetric DM interacting via a light (but
not necessarily massless) Abelian gauge vector boson, a dark photon. In the
massless dark photon limit, gauge invariance mandates that DM be
multicomponent, consisting of positive and negative dark ions of different
species which partially bind in neutral dark atoms. We argue that a similar
conclusion holds for light dark photons; in particular, we establish that the
multi-component and atomic character of DM persists in much of the parameter
space where the dark photon is sufficiently light to mediate sizeable DM
self-interactions. We discuss the cosmological sequence of events in this
scenario, including the dark asymmetry generation, the freeze-out of
annihilations, the dark recombination and the phase transition which gives mass
to the dark photon. We estimate the effect of self-interactions in DM haloes,
taking into account this cosmological history. We place constraints based on
the observed ellipticity of large haloes, and identify the regimes where DM
self-scattering can affect the dynamics of smaller haloes, bringing theory in
better agreement with observations. Moreover, we estimate the cosmological
abundance of dark photons in various regimes, and derive pertinent bounds.

  references",,,,"q-fin.PR q-fin.GN","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The inclusion of DVA in the fair-value of derivative transactions has now
become standard accounting practice in most parts of the world. Furthermore,
some sophisticated banks are including an FVA (Funding Valuation Adjustment),
but since DVA can be interpreted as a funding benefit the oft-debated issue
regarding a possible double-counting of funding benefits arises, with little
consensus as to its resolution. One possibility is to price the derivative by
replication, guaranteeing a consistent inclusion of costs and benefits.
However, as has recently been noted, DVA is (at least partially) unhedgeable,
having no exact market hedge. Furthermore, current frameworks shed little light
on the controversial question, raised by Hull (2012), of whether the effect a
derivative has on the riskiness of an institution's debt should be taken into
account when calculating FVA.
  In this paper we propose a solution to these two problems by identifying an
instrument, a fictitious CDS written on the hedging counterparty which is
implicitly contained in any given derivatives transaction. This allows us to
show that the hedger's unhedged jump-to-default risk has, despite not being
actively managed, a well defined value associated to a funding benefit.
Carrying out the replication including such a CDS, we obtain a price for the
derivative consisting of its collateralized equivalent, a contingent CVA, a
contingent DVA, and an FVA, coupled to the price via the hedger's short-term
bond-CDS basis.
  The resulting funding cost is non-zero, but substantially smaller than what
is obtained in alternative approaches due to the effect the derivative has on
the recovery of the hedger's liabilities. Also, price agreement is possible for
two sophisticated counterparties entering a deal if their bond-CDS bases obey a
certain relationship, similar to what was first obtained by Morini and
Prampolini (2010).

carry out the ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) study of the interaction
dynamics for H$_{2}$ impingement against the stoichiometric PuO$_{2}$(111), the
reduced PuO$_{2}$(111), and the stoichiometric $\alpha $-Pu$_{2}$O$_{3}$(111)
surfaces. The hydrogen molecular physisorption states, which can not be
captured by pure DFT+\textit{U} method, are obtained by employing the
vdW-DFT+\textit{U} scheme. We show that except for the weak physisorption,
PuO$_{2}$(111) surfaces are so difficult of access that almost all of the
H$_{2}$ molecules will bounce back to the vacuum when their initial kinetic
energies are not sufficient. Although the dissociative adsorption of H$_{2}$ on
PuO$_{2}$(111) surfaces is found to be very exothermic, the collision-induced
dissociation barriers of H$_{2}$ are calculated to be as high as $3.2$ eV and
$2.0$ eV for stoichiometric and reduced PuO$_{2}$ surfaces, respectively.
Unlike PuO$_{2}$, our AIMD study directly reveals that the hydrogen molecules
can penetrate into $\alpha $-Pu$_{2}$O$_{3}$(111) surface and diffuse easily
due to the $25$\ native O vacancies located along the $\langle $111$\rangle $
diagonals of $\alpha $-Pu$_{2}$O$_{3}$ matrix. By examining the temperature
effect and the internal vibrational excitations of H$_{2}$, we provide a
detailed insight into the interaction dynamics of H$_{2}$ in $\alpha
$-Pu$_{2}$O$_{3}$. The optimum pathways for hydrogen penetration and diffusion,
the corresponding energy barriers ($1.0$ eV and $0.53$ eV, respectively) and
rate constants are systematically calculated. Overall, our study fairly reveals
the different interaction mechanisms between H$_{2}$ and Pu-oxide surfaces,
which have strong implications to the interpretation of experimental
observations.

It shows that the performance of our estimators is closely related to geometric

establish new conditions under which the estimators of $f_1$ have up to first
order the same sharp upper bound as the corresponding estimators of $f_1$ in

possess PB1, PB2 and HA segments derived entirely from one or the other

physical aging wherein their structure evolves to lower the free energy. In

evolution of elastic and viscous moduli at different frequencies and observe
that freshly prepared aqueous suspension of Laponite demonstrates identical
rheological behavior reported for the crosslinking polymeric materials
undergoing chemical gelation. Consequently at a certain time tan{\delta} is
observed to be independent of frequency. However, for samples preserved under
rest condition for longer duration before applying the shear melting, the
liquid to solid transition subsequent to shear melting shows greater deviation
from classical gelation. We also obtain continuous relaxation time spectra from
the frequency dependence of viscous modulus. We observe that, with increase in
the rest time, continuous relaxation time spectrum shows gradual variation from
negative slope, describing dominance of fast relaxation modes to positive slope
representing dominance of slow relaxation modes. We propose that the deviation
from gelation behavior for the shear melted suspensions originates from
inability of shear melting to completely break the percolated structure thereby
creating unbroken aggregates. The volume fraction of such unbroken aggregates
increases with the rest time. For small rest times presence of fewer number of
unbroken aggregates cause deviation from the classical gelation. On the other
hand, at high rest times presence of greater fraction of unbroken aggregates
subsequent to shear melting demonstrate dynamic arrest leading to inversion of
relaxation time spectra.

design, operation, and data reduction, and describe in detail the approach
taken to relative calibration (removal of instrument signatures) and absolute
calibration against standard astronomical sources. The calibration scheme
assumes a spatially extended source and uses the Herschel telescope as primary
calibrator. Conversion from extended to point-source calibration is carried out
using observations of the planet Uranus. The model of the telescope emission is
shown to be accurate to within 6% and repeatable to better than 0.06% and, by
comparison with models of Mars and Neptune, the Uranus model is shown to be
accurate to within 3%. Multiple observations of a number of point-like sources
show that the repeatability of the calibration is better than 1%, if the
effects of the satellite absolute pointing error (APE) are corrected. The
satellite APE leads to a decrement in the derived flux, which can be up to ~10%
(1 sigma) at the high-frequency end of the SPIRE range in the first part of the
mission, and ~4% after Herschel operational day 1011. The lower frequency range
of the SPIRE band is unaffected by this pointing error due to the larger beam
size. Overall, for well-pointed, point-like sources, the absolute flux
calibration is better than 6%, and for extended sources where mapping is
required it is better than 7%.

evaluate IS research relevance. Kitchenham et al [13] proposed one of the few
relevance evaluating instruments in literature, later revised by Daneva et al

relevance in order to evaluate its comprehensibility and applicability from the
point of view of the practitioner/consultant in the context of an advanced
university classroom. Method: Five master level students in the field of IS
assessed a set of 24 papers using the relevance checklist1. For each question
in the checklist, inter-rater agreement has been calculated and the reasoning
that the practitioners applied has been reconstructed from comments. Results:
Inter-rater agreement only showed to be slight for three questions and poor for
all other questions. Analysis of comments provided by the practitioners showed
only two questions that were interpreted in the same way by all practitioners.
These two questions showed significantly higher inter-rater agreement than
other questions. Conclusions: The generally low inter-rater agreement could be
explained as an indication that the checklist1 is in its current form not
appropriate for measuring industry relevance of IS research. The different
interpretations found for the checklist questions provide useful insight for
reformulation of questions. Reformulations are proposed for some questions.

the projected spatial and velocity distribution and characterize the degree of
subclustering. We find that RS, BC, and GV galaxies in these clusters have
similar velocity distributions, but that BC and GV galaxies tend to avoid the
core of the two z~0.55 clusters. GV galaxies exhibit subclustering properties
similar to RS galaxies, but their radial velocity distribution is significantly
platykurtic compared to the RS galaxies. The absence of GV galaxies in the
cluster cores may explain their somewhat prolonged star-formation history. The
LCBGs appear to have recently fallen into the cluster based on their larger
velocity dispersion, absence from the cores of the clusters, and different
radial velocity distribution than the RS galaxies. Both LCBG and BC galaxies
show a high degree of subclustering on the smallest scales, leading us to
conclude that star formation is likely triggered by galaxy-galaxy interactions
during infall into the cluster.

and control of chiral symmetry are largely understudied. We investigate
possibility of chirality control in a chemical excitable system (the BZ
reaction) by application of a chiral (rotating) electric field using the
Oregonator model. We find that unlike previous findings, we can achieve the
chirality control not only in the field rotation direction, but also opposite
to it, depending on the field rotation frequency. To unravel the mechanism, we
further develop a comprehensive theory of frequency synchronization based on
the response function approach. We find that this problem can be described by
the Adler equation and show phase-locking phenomena, known as the Arnold

numerical simulations and provide a solid basis for chirality control in
excitable media.

faults in general-purpose software. To provide high-quality fix suggestions and
to enable automation of the whole debugging process, AutoFix relies on the
presence of simple specification elements in the form of contracts (such as
pre- and postconditions). Using contracts enhances the precision of dynamic
analysis techniques for fault detection and localization, and for validating
fixes. The only required user input to the AutoFix supporting tool is then a
faulty program annotated with contracts; the tool produces a collection of
validated fixes for the fault ranked according to an estimate of their
suitability.
  In an extensive experimental evaluation, we applied AutoFix to over 200
faults in four code bases of different maturity and quality (of implementation
and of contracts). AutoFix successfully fixed 42% of the faults, producing, in
the majority of cases, corrections of quality comparable to those competent
programmers would write; the used computational resources were modest, with an
average time per fix below 20 minutes on commodity hardware. These figures
compare favorably to the state of the art in automated program fixing, and
demonstrate that the AutoFix approach is successfully applicable to reduce the
debugging burden in real-world scenarios.

almost all eigenstates have maximal entanglement between fixed-size sub-blocks
of qubits and the rest of the system; in this sense these eigenstates are like

are concerned the system is like a non-interacting one. The comparison applies
to chains of qubits with translationally invariant nearest-neighbour
interactions, but we show that it is extendible to much more general systems
(both in terms of the local dimension and the geometry of interaction).
Numerical evidence is also presented which suggests that the translational
invariance condition may be dropped in the case of nearest-neighbour chains.

calculated assuming an underdense plasma, $\omega_{0} >\omega_{p}$, where
$\omega_{0}$ is the frequency of the RF and $\omega_{p}$ is the plasma
frequency. In order to highlight the effect of the radiation field we present a
comparison of our analytical and numerical results obtained for nonzero RF with
those for vanishing RF. In particular, it has been shown that the weak RF
increases the mean energy loss for small angles between the velocity of the REB
and the direction of polarization of the RF while decreasing it at large
angles. Furthermore, the relative deviation of the energy loss from the
field-free value is strongly reduced with increasing the beam energy. Special
case of the parallel orientation of the polarization of the RF with respect to
the beam velocity has been also considered. At high-intensities of the RF two
extreme regimes have been distinguished when the excited harmonics cancel
effectively each other reducing strongly the energy loss or increasing it due
to the constructive interference. Moreover, it has been demonstrated that the
energy loss of the ultrarelativistic electron beam increases systematically
with the intensity of the RF exceeding essentially the field-free value.

compute the epicyclic frequencies of nearly circular orbits around rotating
strange quark stars. The MIT bag model is used to model the equation of state
of quark matter and the uniformly rotating stellar configurations are computed
in full general relativity. The vertical epicyclic frequency and the related
nodal precession rate of inclined orbits are very sensitive to the oblateness
of the rotating star. For slowly rotating stellar models of moderate and high
mass strange stars, the sense of the nodal precession changes at a certain
rotation rate. At lower stellar rotation rates the orbital nodal precession is
prograde, as it is in the Kerr metric, while at higher rotation rates the
precession is retrograde, as it is for Maclaurin spheroids. Thus,
qualitatively, the orbits around rapidly rotating strange quark stars are
affected more strongly by the effects of stellar oblateness than by the effects
of general relativity. We show that epicyclic and orbital frequencies
calculated numerically for small mass strange stars are in very good agreement
with analytical formulae for Maclaurin spheroids.

Partial reflections of waves at these newly created features, allows new
standing-wave instabilities to appear that saturate and decay in their turn,
scattering particles at new locations, creating a recurring cycle. The spiral
activity causes the general level of random motion to rise, gradually
decreasing the ability of the disk to support further activity unless the disk
contains a dissipative gas component from which stars form on near-circular
orbits. We also show that this interpretation is consistent with the behavior
reported in other recent simulations with low mass-disks.

outside but near the Cu-O-Cu spin chains, bond disorder, i.e. a spatial
variation of the exchange interaction $J$, is expected to be realized in these
chains. We observe that the magnetic heat conductivity
($\kappa_{\mathrm{mag}}$) due to spinons propagating in the chains is gradually
but strongly suppressed with increasing amount of Ca, where the doping
dependence can be understood in terms of increased scattering of spinons due to
Ca-induced disorder. This is also reflected in the spinon mean free path which
can be separated in a doping independent but temperature dependent scattering
length due to spinon-phonon scattering, and a temperature independent but
doping dependent spinon-defect scattering length. The latter spans from very
large ($>$ 1300 lattice spacings) to very short ($\sim$ 12 lattice spacings)
and scales with the average distance between two neighboring Ca atoms. Thus,
the Ca-induced disorder acts as an effective defect within the spin chain, and
the doping scheme allows to cover the whole doping regime between the clean and
the dirty limits. Interestingly, at maximum impurity level we observe, in
Ca-doped Sr$_2$CuO$_3$, an almost linear increase of $\kappa_{\mathrm{mag}}$ at
temperatures above 100 K which reflects the intrinsic low temperature behavior
of heat transport in a Heisenberg spin chain. These findings are quite
different from that observed for the Ca-doped double spin chain compound,
SrCuO$_2$, where the effect of Ca seems to saturate already at intermediate
doping levels.

the artery is occluded or a thrombus is built through a rupture of the plaque.
After describing a mathematical model and the discretization scheme, we present
some benchmark tests comparing the CDG2 method to other commonly used DG
methods. Furthermore, we take parallelization and higher order discretization

It consists of a two-step transformation of the original data plus a classifier
operating on a low-dimensional hypercube. The functional data are first mapped
into a finite-dimensional location-slope space and then transformed by a
multivariate depth function into the $DD$-plot, which is a subset of the unit
hypercube. This transformation yields a new notion of depth for functional
data. Three alternative depth functions are employed for this, as well as two
rules for the final classification on $[0,1]^q$. The resulting classifier has
to be cross-validated over a small range of parameters only, which is
restricted by a Vapnik-Cervonenkis bound. The entire methodology does not
involve smoothing techniques, is completely nonparametric and allows to achieve
Bayes optimality under standard distributional settings. It is robust,
efficiently computable, and has been implemented in an R environment.
Applicability of the new approach is demonstrated by simulations as well as a
benchmark study.

explosion and model the resulting ejecta and radiation. Our theoretical models
of such red-supergiant-star explosions at different metallicity show that
synthetic spectra of SNe II-P possess optical signatures during the
recombination phase that are sensitive to metallicity variations. This
sensitivity can be quantified and the metallicity inferred from the strength of
metal-line absorptions. Furthermore, these signatures are not limited to O, but
also include Na, Ca, Sc, Ti, or Fe. When compared to a sample of SNe II-P from
the Carnegie SN Project and previous SN followup programs, we find that most
events lie at a metallicity between 0.4 and 2 x solar, with a marked scarcity
of SN II-P events at SMC metallicity. This most likely reflects the paucity of
low metallicity star forming regions in the local Universe.
  SNe II-P have high plateau luminosities that make them observable
spectroscopically at large distances. Because they exhibit signatures of
diverse metal species, in the future they may offer a means to constrain the
evolution of the composition (e.g., the O/Fe ratio) in the Universe out to a
redshift of one and beyond.

synchronization may be well described by using the population-averaged global
potential $V_G$ in computational neuroscience. The time-averaged fluctuation of
$V_G$ plays the role of a ""thermodynamic"" order parameter $\cal {O}$ used for
describing the synchrony-asynchrony transition in neural systems. Population
spike synchronization may be well visualized in the raster plot of neural
spikes. The degree of neural synchronization seen in the raster plot is well
measured in terms of a ""statistical-mechanical"" spike-based measure $M_s$
introduced by considering the occupation and the pacing patterns of spikes. The
global potential $V_G$ is also used to give a reference global cycle for the
calculation of $M_s$. Hence, $V_G$ becomes an important collective quantity
because it is associated with calculation of both $\cal {O}$ and $M_s$.
However, it is practically difficult to directly get $V_G$ in real experiments.
To overcome this difficulty, instead of $V_G$, we employ the instantaneous
population spike rate (IPSR) which can be obtained in experiments, and develop
realistic thermodynamic and statistical-mechanical measures, based on IPSR, to
make practical characterization of the neural synchronization in both
computational and experimental neuroscience. Particularly, more accurate
characterization of weak sparse spike synchronization can be achieved in terms
of realistic statistical-mechanical IPSR-based measure, in comparison with the
conventional measure based on $V_G$.
