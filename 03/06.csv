optimized short-ranged radial (isotropic) pair potentials that robustly produce
novel targeted classical ground-state many-particle configurations. The target
structures considered in those studies were low-coordinated crystals with a
high degree of symmetry. In this paper, we further test the fundamental
limitations of radial pair potentials by targeting crystal structures with
appreciably less symmetry, including those in which the particles have
different local structural environments. These challenging target
configurations demanded that we modify previous inverse optimization
techniques. Using this modified optimization technique, we have designed
short-ranged radial pair potentials that stabilize the two-dimensional kagome
crystal, the rectangular kagome crystal, and rectangular lattices, as well as
the three-dimensional structure of CaF$_2$ crystal inhabited by a single
particle species. We verify our results by cooling liquid configurations to
absolute zero temperature via simulated annealing and ensuring that such states
have stable phonon spectra. Except for the rectangular kagome structure, all of
the target structures can be stabilized with monotonic repulsive potentials.
Our work demonstrates that single-component systems with short-ranged radial
pair potentials can counterintuitively self-assemble into crystal ground states
with low symmetry and different local structural environments. Finally, we
present general principles that offer guidance in determining whether certain
target structures can be achieved as ground states by radial pair potentials.

SDSS type 2 quasars (QSO2) at z<~0.1 (20/21, detection rate 95%), implying that
this is a ubiquitous phenomenon in this object class also at the lowest z. The
outflowing gas has high densities (n_e>1000 cm-3) and covers a region the size
of a few kpc. This implies ionized outflow masses M~(0.3-2.4)x1e6 Msun and mass
outflow rates M(dot)<few Msun yr-1.
  The triggering mechanism of the outflows is related to the nuclear activity.
The QSO2 can be classified in two groups according to the behavior and
properties of the outflowing gas. QSO2 in Group 1 (5/20 objects) show the most
extreme turbulence, they have on average higher radio luminosities and higher
excess of radio emission. QSO2 in Group 2 (15/20 objects) show less extreme
turbulence, they have lower radio luminosities and, on average, lower or no
radio excess.
  We propose that two competing outflow mechanisms are at work: radio jets and
accretion disk winds. Radio jet induced outflows are dominant in Group 1, while
disk winds dominate in Group 2. We find that the radio jet mode is capable of
producing more extreme outflows. To test this interpretation we predict that:
1) high resolution VLBA imaging will reveal the presence of jets in Group 1
QSO2; 2) the morphology of their extended ionized nebulae must be more highly
collimated and kinematically perturbed.

study the dynamics of threshold models that take both the network topology and
the timings of contacts into account, using empirical contact sequences as
substrates. The models are designed such that adoption is driven by the number
of contacts with different adopted neighbors within a chosen time. We find that
while some networks support cascades leading to network-level adoption, some do
not: the propagation of adoption depends on several factors from the frequency
of contacts to burstiness and timing correlations of contact sequences. More
specifically, burstiness is seen to suppress cascades sizes when compared to
randomised contact timings, while timing correlations between contacts on
adjacent links facilitate cascades.

astrophysics. This contribution focuses on the estimation of the symmetry
energy from experiment and how it is related to the structure of neutron stars.
The most important connection is between the radii of neutron stars and the
pressure of neutron star matter in the vicinity of the nuclear saturation
density $n_s$. This pressure is essentially controlled by the nuclear symmetry
energy parameters $S_v$ and $L$, the first two coefficients of a Taylor
expansion of the symmetry energy around $n_s$. We discuss constraints on these
parameters that can be found from nuclear experiments. We demonstrate that
these constraints are largely model-independent by deriving them qualitatively
from a simple nuclear model. We also summarize how recent theoretical studies
of pure neutron matter can reinforce these constraints. To date, several
different astrophysical measurements of neutron star radii have been attempted.
Attention is focused on photospheric radius expansion bursts and on thermal
emissions from quiescent low-mass X-ray binaries. While none of these
observations can, at the present time, determine individual neutron star radii
to better than 20% accuracy, the body of observations can be used with Bayesian
techniques to effectively constrain them to higher precision. These techniques
invert the structure equations and obtain estimates of the pressure-density
relation of neutron star matter, not only near $n_s$, but up to the highest
densities found in neutron star interiors. The estimates we derive for neutron
star radii are in concordance with predictions from nuclear experiment and
theory.

magnetic helicity by computing different four-point SQED Feynman diagrams. For
any considered volume, the magnetic flux across its boundaries is in principle
non null, which means that the magnetic helicity in those regions is gauge
dependent. We use the prescription given by Berger and Field and interpret our
result as the difference between two magnetic configurations that coincide in
the exterior volume. In this case the magnetic helicity gives only the number
of magnetic links inside the considered volume. We calculate a concrete value
of $H_M$ for large scales and analyze the distribution of magnetic defects as a
function of the scale. Those defects correspond to regular as well as random
fields in the considered volume. We find that the fractal dimension of the
distribution of topological defects is $D = 1/2$. We also study if the regular
fields induced on large scales are helical, finding that they are and that the
associated number of magnetic defects is independent of the scale. In this case
the fractal dimension is $D=0$. We finally estimate the intensity of fields
induced at the horizon scale of reheating, and evolve them until the decoupling
of matter and radiation under the hypothesis of inverse cascade of magnetic
helicity. The resulting intensity is high enough and the coherence length long

obtained using random walks. More precisely, if the probability of return of
the simple random walk is $\succeq \textrm{exp}(-n^\gamma)$ in a Cayley graph
then $\alpha \geq (1-\gamma)/(1+\gamma)$. This motivates the study of further
relations between return probability, speed, entropy and volume growth. For
example, if $|B_n| \preceq e^{n^\nu}$ then the speed is $\preceq
n^{1/(2-\nu)}$.
  Under a strong assumption on the off-diagonal decay of the heat kernel, the
lower bound on compression improves to $\alpha \geq 1-\gamma$. Using a result
from Naor and Peres on compression and the speed of random walks, this yields
very promising bounds on speed and implies the Liouville property if $\gamma

exhibit a delay of up to about 10 seconds between the trigger time of the hard
X-ray signal as measured by the Fermi GBM and the onset of the MeV-GeV
counterpart detected by the LAT. This delay may hint at important physics,
whether it is due to the intrinsic variability of the inner engine or it is
related to quantum dispersion effects in the velocity of light propagation from
the sources to the observer. It is critical to have a proper assessment of how
these time delays affect the overall properties of the light curves. We
cross-correlated the 5 brightest GRBs of the 1st Fermi LAT Catalog by means of
the continuous correlation function (CCF) and of the Discrete Correlation
Function (DCF). A maximum in the DCF suggests the presence of a time lag
between the curves, whose value and uncertainty are estimated through a
Gaussian fitting of the DCF profile and light curve simulation via a Monte
Carlo approach. The cross-correlation of the observed LAT and GBM light curves
yields time lags that are mostly similar to those reported in the literature,
but they are formally consistent with zero. The cross-correlation of the
simulated light curves yields smaller errors on the time lags and more than one
time lag for GRBs 090902B and 090926A; for all 5 GRBs, the time lags are
significantly different from zero and consistent with those reported in the
literature, when only the secondary maxima are considered for those two GRBs.
The DCF method evidences the presence of time lags between the LAT and GBM
light curves and underlines their complexity. While this suggests that the
delays should be ascribed to intrinsic physical mechanisms, more sensitivity
and larger statistics are needed to assess whether time lags are universally
present in the early GRB emission and which dynamical time scales they trace.

model of collective motion. In the appropriate overdamped limit we recover the
well-known Vicsek model, which dissipates rotational information and does not
allow for polarized turns. Although the new model has its most vivid success in
describing turning groups, its dynamics is intrinsically different from
previous ones in a wide dynamical regime, while reducing to the hydrodynamic
description of Toner and Tu at very large length-scales. The derived framework
is therefore general and it may describe the collective motion of any strongly

characterizing the population of the highly-excited metastable H3O+ rotational

Sagittarius B2 envelope, as well as the foreground gas clouds between the Sun

that does not intersect the Central Molecular Zone, but instead traces
quiescent gas in the Galactic disk, also imply a high rotational temperature of
~ 380 K, well in excess of the kinetic temperature of the diffuse Galactic
interstellar medium. While it is plausible that some fraction of the molecular
gas may be heated to such high temperatures in the active environment of the
Galactic center, characterized by high X-ray and cosmic ray fluxes, shocks and
high degree of turbulence, this is unlikely in the largely quiescent
environment of the Galactic disk clouds. We suggest instead that the
highly-excited states of the hydronium ion are populated mainly by exoergic
chemical formation processes and temperature describing the rotational level
population does not represent the physical temperature of the medium. The same
arguments may be applicable to other symmetric top rotors, such as ammonia.
This offers a simple explanation to the long-standing puzzle of the presence of
a pervasive, hot molecular gas component in the central region of the Milky
Way. Moreover, our observations suggest that this is a universal process, not

well defined physical properties at the level of linearized perturbations. The
formalism is constructed for a medium with arbitrary symmetry, and then
specialised to isotropic media (which will be the case of interest for the
majority of cosmological applications). We develop the theory of relativistic
isotropic viscoelastic media whilst keeping in mind that we ultimately want to
observationally constrain the allowed properties of the material model. We do
this by obtaining the viscoelastic equations of state for perturbations (the
entropy and anisotropic stress), as well as identifying the consistent corner
of the theory which has constant equation of state parameter $\dot{w}=0$. We
also connect to the non-relativistic theory of solids, by identifying the two
quadratic invariants that are needed to construct the energy-momentum tensor,
namely the Rayleigh dissipation function and Lagrangian for perturbations.
Finally, we develop the notion that the viscoelastic behavior of the medium can
be thought of as a non-minimally coupled massive gravity theory. This also
provides a tool-kit for constructing consistent generalizations of coupled dark

work, we mathematically reveal the existence of Floquet-Bloch modes in the

Maxwell's equations alone without invoking the Floquet-Bloch theorem. Starting
with a transfer-matrix representation of the electromagnetic field in a generic
layered medium, we apply Fourier transformation and a series of mathematical
manipulations to isolate a term explicitly dependent on Floquet-Bloch modes.
Fourier-domain representation of the electromagnetic field can be reduced into
a product of the Floquet-Bloch term and two other matrix factors: one governed
by reflections from the medium boundaries and another dependent on layer
composition. Electromagnetic fields in any finite, lossy, layered structure can
now be interpreted in the Fourier-domain by separable factors dependent on
distinct physical features of the structure. The developed theory enables new
methods for analyzing and communicating the electromagnetic properties of

bias across it. The resulting supercurrent flow may, in suitable conditions,
fully counterbalance the temperature-bias-induced quasiparticle current
therefore preventing the formation of any voltage drop, i.e., a thermovoltage,
across the superconductor. Yet, the appearance of a thermophase is expected to
occur in Josephson-coupled superconductors as well. Here we theoretically
investigate the thermoelectric response of a thermally-biased Josephson

occurrence of a very large thermophase which can reach $\pi/2$ across the

analysis. Results obtained with simulated bunches of various shapes and
experimental measured spectra are presented, discussed and compared with the

interactions between elements in the vicinity of an enhancer-promoter pair can
influence their contact frequency. Our equilibrium polymer simulations show
that a chromatin loop, formed by elements flanking either an enhancer or a
promoter, suppresses enhancer-promoter interactions, working as an insulator. A
loop formed by elements located in the region between an enhancer and a
promoter, on the contrary, facilitates their interactions. We find that
different mechanisms underlie insulation and facilitation; insulation occurs
due to steric exclusion by the loop, and is a global effect, while facilitation
occurs due to an effective shortening of the enhancer-promoter genomic
distance, and is a local effect. Consistently, we find that these effects
manifest quite differently for in silico 3C and microscopy. Our results show
that looping interactions that do not directly involve an enhancer-promoter
pair can nevertheless significantly modulate their interactions. This
phenomenon is analogous to allosteric regulation in proteins, where a
conformational change triggered by binding of a regulatory molecule to one site
affects the state of another site.

The first causal mechanism by which interference can operate is a direct causal
effect of one individual's treatment on another individual's outcome; we call
this direct interference. Interference by contagion is present when one
individual's outcome may affect the outcomes of other individuals with whom he
comes into contact. Then giving treatment to the first individual could have an
indirect effect on others through the treated individual's outcome. The third
pathway by which interference may operate is allocational interference.
Treatment in this case allocates individuals to groups; through interactions
within a group, individuals may affect one another's outcomes in any number of
ways. In many settings, more than one type of interference will be present
simultaneously. The causal effects of interest differ according to which types
of interference are present, as do the conditions under which causal effects
are identifiable. Using causal diagrams for interference, we describe these
differences, give criteria for the identification of important causal effects,
and discuss applications to infectious diseases.

to any hypothetical line observed in this energy range. We find that given the
amount of flux that is observable, explanations in terms of decay are more
plausible than annihilation, at least if the annihilation is directly to
Standard Model states rather than intermediate particles. The decay case can be
explained by a scalar or pseudoscalar field coupling to photons suppressed by a
scale not far below the reduced Planck mass, which can be taken as a
tantalizing hint of high-scale physics. The scalar case is particularly
interesting from the effective field theory viewpoint, and we discuss it at
some length. Because of a quartically divergent mass correction, naturalness
strongly suggests the theory should be cut off at or below the 1000 TeV scale.
The most plausible such natural UV completion would involve supersymmetry.
These bottom-up arguments reproduce expectations from top-down considerations
of the physics of moduli. A keV line could also arise from the decay of a

series of traits collectively termed the domestication syndrome. Current debate
concerns the pace at which domesticated plants emerged from cultivated wild
populations and how many genes were involved. Here we present simulations that
test how many genes could have been involved by considering the cost of
selection. We demonstrate the selection load that can be endured by populations
increases with decreasing selection coefficients and greater numbers of loci
down to values of about s = 0.005, causing a driving force that increases the
number of loci under selection. As the number of loci under selection
increases, an effect of co-selection increases resulting in individual unlinked
loci being fixed more rapidly in out-crossing populations, representing a
second driving force to increase the number of loci under selection. In
inbreeding systems co-selection results in interference and reduced rates of
fixation but does not reduce the size of the selection load that can be
endured. These driving forces result in an optimum pace of genome evolution in
which 50-100 loci are the most that could be under selection in a cultivation
regime. Furthermore, the simulations do not preclude the existence of selective
sweeps but demonstrate that they come at a cost of the selection load that can
be endured and consequently a reduction of the capacity of plants to adapt to
new environments, which may contribute to the explanation of why selective
sweeps have been so rarely detected in genome studies.

maximize a utility that reflects the tradeoff between the monetary transactions
from charging/discharging and the penalty from power regulation. Unlike
existing game-theoretic works which assume that players make their decisions
rationally and objectively, we use the new framework of prospect theory (PT) to
explicitly incorporate the users' subjective perceptions of their expected
utilities. For the two-player game, we show the existence of a proper mixed
Nash equilibrium for both the standard game-theoretic case and the case with PT
considerations. Simulation results show that incorporating user behavior via PT
reveals several important insights into load management as well as economics of
energy storage usage. For instance, the results show that deviations from
conventional game theory, as predicted by PT, can lead to undesirable grid
loads and revenues thus requiring the power company to revisit its pricing
schemes and the customers to reassess their energy storage usage choices.

SNR, the spectral continuum below 200 MeV which can be attributed to neutral
pion emission. Confirming the hadronic origin of the gamma-ray emission near
100 MeV is then of the greatest importance. Our paper is focused on a global
re-assessment of all available data and models of particle acceleration in W44,
with the goal of determining on a firm ground the hadronic and leptonic
contributions to the overall spectrum. We also present new gamma-ray and CO
NANTEN2 data on W44, and compare them with recently published AGILE and Fermi
data. Our analysis strengthens previous studies and observations of the W44
complex environment and provides new information for a more detailed modeling.
In particular, we determine that the average gas density of the regions
emitting 100 MeV - 10 GeV gamma-rays is relatively high (n= 250 - 300 cm^-3).
The hadronic interpretation of the gamma-ray spectrum of W44 is viable, and
supported by strong evidence. It implies a relatively large value for the
average magnetic field (B > 10^2 microG) in the SNR surroundings, sign of field
amplification by shock-driven turbulence. Our new analysis establishes that the
spectral index of the proton energy distribution function is p1 = 2.2 +/- 0.1

hadronic versus leptonic-only models of emission taking into account

are reduced by a factor of two compared to models without any AGN feedback at
all halo masses. However, massive galaxies simulated with thermal AGN feedback
show a factor of ~10-100 higher X-ray luminosities than observed. The
mechanical/radiation feedback model reproduces the observed correlation between
X-ray luminosities and velocity dispersion, e.g. for galaxies with sigma = 200
km/s, the X-ray luminosity is reduced from $10^{42}$ erg/s to $10^{40}$ erg/s.
It also efficiently suppresses late time star formation, reducing the specific
star formation rate from $10^{-10.5}$ $yr^{-1}$ to $10^{-14}$ $yr^{-1}$ on
average and resulting in quiescent galaxies since z=2, whereas the thermal
feedback model shows higher late time in-situ star formation rates than
observed.

key to distinguish among cosmological models. One can estimate the derivative
$dD(z)/d\ln(1+z)$ from redshift space measurements of the 3D anisotropic galaxy
two-point correlation $\xi(z)$, but the degeneracy of its transverse (or
projected) component with galaxy bias $b$, i.e. $\xi_{\perp}(z) \propto\ D^2(z)
b^2(z)$, introduces large errors in the growth measurement. Here we present a
comparison between two methods which break this degeneracy by combining second-
and third-order statistics. One uses the shape of the reduced three-point
correlation and the other a combination of third-order one- and two-point
cumulants. These methods use the fact that, for Gaussian initial conditions and
scales larger than $20$ $h^{-1}$Mpc, the reduced third-order matter
correlations are independent of redshift (and therefore of the growth factor)
while the third-order galaxy correlations depend on $b$. We use matter and halo
catalogs from the MICE-GC simulation to test how well we can recover $b(z)$ and
therefore $D(z)$ with these methods in 3D real space. We also present a new
approach, which enables us to measure $D$ directly from the redshift evolution
of second- and third-order galaxy correlations without the need of modelling
matter correlations. For haloes with masses lower than $10^{14}$
$h^{-1}$M$_\odot$, we find $10%$ deviations between the different estimates of
$D$, which are comparable to current observational errors. At higher masses we
find larger differences that can probably be attributed to the breakdown of the

Mpc/h)$^3$ volume following the Pop III-Pop II transition and for different Pop
III IMFs. We have analyzed the joint evolution of metal enrichment on galactic
and intergalactic scales at z=6 and z=4. Galaxies account for <9% of the
baryonic mass; the remaining gas resides in the diffuse phases: (a) voids, i.e.
regions with extremely low density ($\Delta$<1), (b) the true intergalactic
medium (IGM, 1<$\Delta$<10) and (c) the circumgalactic medium (CGM,
10<$\Delta<10^{2.5}$), the interface between the IGM and galaxies. By z=6 a
galactic mass-metallicity relation is established. At z=4, galaxies with a
stellar mass $M_*=10^{8.5}M_\odot$ show log(O/H)+12=8.19, consistent with
observations. The total amount of heavy elements rises from
$\Omega^{SFH}_Z=1.52\, 10^{-6}$ at z=6 to 8.05 $10^{-6}$ at z=4. Metals in
galaxies make up to ~0.89 of such budget at z=6; this fraction increases to
~0.95 at z=4. At z=6 (z=4) the remaining metals are distributed in
CGM/IGM/voids with the following mass fractions: 0.06/0.04/0.01
(0.03/0.02/0.01). Analogously to galaxies, at z=4 a density-metallicity
($\Delta$-Z) relation is in place for the diffuse phases: the IGM/voids have a
spatially uniform metallicity, Z~$10^{-3.5}$Zsun; in the CGM Z steeply rises
with density up to ~$10^{-2}$Zsun. In all diffuse phases a considerable
fraction of metals is in a warm/hot (T>$10^{4.5}$K) state. Due to these
physical conditions, CIV absorption line experiments can probe only ~2% of the
total carbon present in the IGM/CGM; however, metal absorption line spectra are
very effective tools to study reionization. Finally, the Pop III star formation
history is almost insensitive to the chosen Pop III IMF. Pop III stars are
preferentially formed in truly pristine (Z=0) gas pockets, well outside
polluted regions created by previous star formation episodes.

= -2.04 +/- 0.01 (stat.) +/- 0.15 (sys.), which is more metal-poor than implied
by previous photometric and low-resolution spectroscopic studies. NGC 5897 is
alpha-enhanced (to 0.34 +/- 0.01 dex) and shows Fe-peak element ratios typical
of other (metal-poor) halo globular clusters (GCs) with no overall, significant
abundance spreads in iron nor in any other heavy element. Like other GCs, NGC
5897 shows a clear Na-O anti-correlation, where we find a prominent primordial
population of stars with enhanced O abundances and ~Solar Na/Fe ratios, while
two stars are Na-rich, providing chemical proof of the presence of multiple
populations in this cluster. Comparison of the heavy element abundances with
the Solar-scaled values and the metal poor GC M15 from the literature confirms
that NGC 5897 has experienced only little contribution from s-process
nucleosynthesis. One star of the first generation stands out in that it shows
very low La and Eu abundances. Overall, NGC 5897 is a well-behaved GC showing
archetypical correlations and element-patterns, with little room for surprises
in our data. We suggest that its lower metallicity could explain the unusually
long periods of RR Lyr that were found in NGC 5897.

current constraints from flavour, electroweak precision, and Higgs signal
strength data, we determine the allowed sizes of the triple Higgs couplings and
the branching fractions of the heavy Higgs bosons into lighter Higgs bosons.
Identifying the observed Higgs resonance with the light $CP$-even 2HDM Higgs

be reduced by a factor of $0.56$ at the 2 $\sigma$ level. The branching

of the decaying Higgs is below the $t\bar t$ threshold. To facilitate future
studies of collider signatures in 2HDM scenarios with large triple Higgs
couplings or decay modes of the heavy Higgs bosons not covered by the SM Higgs

without reference to an instrument model. For our transmission spectra, our

We find featureless spectra for these three planets. We are unable to extract a

present a fast and independently written Monte Carlo method for cosmological

pre-fetching that helps an individual chain to run on parallel CPUs. An
inter-chain covariance update is also incorporated to prevent clustering of the
chains allowing faster and better mixing of the chains. We use an adaptive

limits on the presence of planets, and to discover the orbital motions of two
binary systems. We determined trigonometric parallaxes with an average accuracy
of 0.09 mas (~0.2 %) resulting in a reference sample for the study of ultracool
dwarfs at the M/L transition, whose members are located at distances of 9.5-40

demonstrated that astrometric observations with an accuracy of 120 micro-arcsec

delays of one process are often affected by the others, resulting in a timing
side channel that leaks the arrival pattern of one process to the others. In
this work, we study such a timing side channel between a regular user and a
malicious attacker. Utilizing Shannon's mutual information as a measure of
information leakage between the user and attacker, we analyze
privacy-preserving behaviors of common work-conserving schedulers. We find that
the attacker can always learn perfectly the user's arrival process in a
longest-queue-first (LQF) scheduler. When the user's job arrival rate is very
low (near zero), first-come-first-serve (FCFS) and round robin schedulers both
completely reveal the user's arrival pattern. The near-complete information
leakage in the low-rate traffic region is proven to be reduced by half in a
work-conserving version of TDMA (WC-TDMA) scheduler, which turns out to be
privacy-optimal in the class of deterministic-working-conserving (det-WC)
schedulers, according to a universal lower bound on information leakage we
derive for all det-WC schedulers.

data in a QFT are quantitatively related, and that detailed information about
non-perturbative saddle point field configurations of path integrals can be
extracted from perturbation theory. Traditionally, only stable NP saddle points
are considered in QFT, and homotopy group considerations are used to classify
them. However, in many QFTs the relevant homotopy groups are trivial, and even
when they are non-trivial they leave many NP saddle points undetected.
Resurgence provides a refined classification of NP-saddles, going beyond
conventional topological considerations. To demonstrate some of these ideas, we
study the $SU(N)$ principal chiral model (PCM), a two dimensional
asymptotically free matrix field theory which has no instantons, because the
relevant homotopy group is trivial. Adiabatic continuity is used to reach a
weakly coupled regime where NP effects are calculable. We then use resurgence
theory to uncover the existence and role of novel `fracton' saddle points,
which turn out to be the fractionalized constituents of previously observed
unstable `uniton' saddle points. The fractons play a crucial role in the
physics of the PCM, and are responsible for the dynamically generated mass gap
of the theory. Moreover, we show that the fracton-anti-fracton events are the
weak coupling realization of 't Hooft's renormalons, and argue that the
renormalon ambiguities are systematically cancelled in the semi-classical
expansion. Our results motivate the conjecture that the semi-classical
expansion of the path integral can be geometrized as a sum over Lefschetz
thimbles.

historically been formulated as either a method of lines (MOL) or a
Lax-Wendroff method. In the MOL viewpoint, the partial differential equation is
treated as a large system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs), where an
ODE tailored time-integrator is applied. In contrast, Lax-Wendroff
discretizations immediately convert Taylor series in time to discrete spatial
derivatives. In this work, we propose the Picard integral formulation (PIF),
which is based on the method of modified fluxes, and is used to derive new
Taylor and Runge-Kutta (RK) methods. In particular, we construct a new class of
conservative finite difference methods by applying WENO reconstructions to the
so-called ""time-averaged"" fluxes. Our schemes are automatically conservative
under any modification of the fluxes, which is attributed to the fact that
classical WENO reconstructions conserve mass when coupled with forward Euler
time steps. The proposed Lax-Wendroff discretization is constructed by taking
Taylor series of the flux function as opposed to Taylor series of the conserved
variables. The RK discretization differs from classical MOL formulations
because we apply WENO reconstructions to time-averaged fluxes rather than
taking linear combinations of spatial derivatives of the flux. In both cases,
we only need one projection onto the characteristic variables per time step.
The PIF is generic, and lends itself to a multitude of options for further
investigation. At present, we present two canonical examples: one based on
Taylor, and the other based on the classical RK method. Stability analyses are
presented for each method. The proposed schemes are applied to hyperbolic
conservation laws in one- and two-dimensions and the results are in good
agreement with current state of the art methods.

cannot make full use of available rack power. The root cause of this rack
underutilization is that the server nameplate power is often much higher than
can be reached in practice. To address rack underutilization, server vendors
are shipping support for per-host power caps, which provide a server-enforced
limit on the amount of power that the server can draw. Using this feature,
datacenter operators can set power caps on the hosts in the rack to ensure that
the sum of those caps does not exceed the rack's provisioned power. While this
approach improves rack utilization, it burdens the operator with managing the
rack power budget across the hosts and does not lend itself to flexible

nontrivial topological surface states (TSS) in 3D topological insulators (TI).
It underlies the iconic topological protection (suppressing elastic
backscattering) of TSS and is foundational to many exotic physics (eg.,
majorana fermions) and device applications (eg., spintronics) predicted for
TIs. Based on this spin-momentum locking, a current flowing on the surface of a
TI would be spin-polarized in a characteristic in-plane direction perpendicular
to the current, and the spin-polarization would reverse when the current
direction reverses. Observing such a spin-helical current in transport
measurements is a major goal in TI research and applications. We report
spin-dependent transport measurements in spin valve devices fabricated from
exfoliated thin flakes of Bi2Se3 (a prototype 3D TI) with ferromagnetic (FM) Ni
contacts. Applying an in-plane magnetic (B) field to polarize the Ni contacts
along their easy axis, we observe an asymmetry in the hysteretic
magnetoresistance (MR) between opposite B field directions. The polarity of the
asymmetry in MR can be reversed by reversing the direction of the DC current.
The observed asymmetric MR can be understood as a spin-valve effect between the
current-induced spin polarization on the TI surface (due to
spin-momentum-locking of TSS) and the spin-polarized ferromagnetic contacts.
Our results provide a direct transport evidence for the spin helical current in

  Ultraviolet Background","5 pages, 5 figures, replaced with version accepted by MNRAS",,"10.1093/mnrasl/slu063",,"astro-ph.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Explaining the existence of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) larger than
$\sim 10^9 M_\odot$ at redshifts $z >\sim 6$ remains an open theoretical
question. One possibility is that gas collapsing rapidly in pristine atomic
cooling halos ($T_{\rm vir} >\sim 10^4 \rm{K}$) produces $10^4-10^6 M_\odot$
black holes. Previous studies have shown that the formation of such a black
hole requires a strong UV background to prevent molecular hydrogen cooling and
gas fragmentation. Recently it has been proposed that a high UV background may
not be required for halos that accrete material extremely rapidly or for halos
where gas cooling is delayed due to a high baryon-dark matter streaming
velocity. In this work, we point out that building up a halo with $T_{\rm vir}
>\sim 10^4 \rm{K}$ before molecular cooling becomes efficient is not sufficient
for forming a direct collapse black hole (DCBH). Though molecular hydrogen
formation may be delayed, it will eventually form at high densities leading to
efficient cooling and fragmentation. The only obvious way that molecular
cooling could be avoided in the absence of strong UV radiation, is for gas to
reach high enough density to cause collisional dissociation of molecular
hydrogen ($\sim 10^4 ~ {\rm cm}^{-3}$) before cooling occurs. However, we argue
that the minimum core entropy, set by the entropy of the intergalactic medium
(IGM) when it decouples from the CMB, prevents this from occurring for
realistic halo masses. This is confirmed by hydrodynamical cosmological
simulations without radiative cooling. We explain the maximum density versus
halo mass in these simulations with simple entropy arguments. The low densities
found suggest that DCBH formation indeed requires a strong UV background.

propose a quantum analogue of this phenomenon. Namely, we define an analogue of
a random access code, where instead of classical bits, one encodes qubits. We
provide a quantum non-signaling box that if supported with two classical bits,
allows to simulate a quantum version of random access code. We point out that

local information about opacities, the algorithm figures out an escape route
that tends to minimize the optical depth without assuming any pre-defined paths

settings with complicated geometry (e.g., core-collapse supernovae, compact
binary mergers, tidal disruptions, star formation, etc.). We implement the MODA
algorithm into both a Eulerian hydrodynamics code with a fixed, uniform grid
and into an SPH code where we make use a tree structure that is otherwise used
for searching neighbours and calculating gravity. In a series of numerical
experiments, we compare the MODA results with analytically known solutions. We
also use snapshots from actual 3D simulations and compare the results of MODA

Fourier transform in the linear circuit model has been a long standing open
problem for over 40 years.
  An early result by Morgenstern from 1973, provides an $\Omega(n \log n)$
lower bound for the unnormalized Fourier transform when the constants used in
the computation are bounded. The proof uses a potential function related to a
determinant. The result does not explain why the normalized Fourier transform
(of unit determinant) should be difficult to compute in the same model. Hence,
the result is not scale insensitive.
  More recently, Ailon (2013) showed that if only unitary 2-by-2 gates are
used, and additionally no extra memory is allowed, then the normalized Fourier
transform requires $\Omega(n\log n)$ steps. This rather limited result is also
sensitive to scaling, but highlights the complexity inherent in the Fourier
transform arising from introducing entropy, unlike, say, the identity matrix
(which is as complex as the Fourier transform using Morgenstern's arguments,
under proper scaling).
  In this work we extend the arguments of Ailon (2013). In the first extension,
which is also the main contribution, we provide a lower bound for computing any
scaling of the Fourier transform. Our restriction is that, the composition of
all gates up to any point must be a well conditioned linear transformation. The
lower bound is $\Omega(R^{-1}n\log n)$, where $R$ is the uniform condition
number. Second, we assume extra space is allowed, as long as it contains
information of bounded norm at the end of the computation.
  The main technical contribution is an extension of matrix entropy used in
Ailon (2013) for unitary matrices to a potential function computable for any
matrix, using Shannon entropy on ""quasi-probabilities"".

In computational motif discovery, Planted (l, d) motif finding is a widely

hardware and software accelerators have been introduced to accelerate the motif
finding algorithms. However, the use of hardware accelerators such as FPGAs
needs hardware specialists to design such systems. Software based acceleration
methods on the other hand are easier to implement than hardware acceleration
techniques. Grid computing is one such software based acceleration technique
which has been used in acceleration of motif finding. However, drawbacks such
as network communication delays and the need of fast interconnection between
nodes in the grid can limit its usage and scalability. As using multicore CPUs
to accelerate CPU intensive tasks are becoming increasingly popular and common
nowadays, we can employ it to accelerate motif finding and it can be a faster
method than grid based acceleration. In this paper, we have explored the use of
multicore CPUs to accelerate motif finding. We have accelerated the Skip-Brute
Force algorithm on multicore CPUs parallelizing it using the POSIX thread

unusual characteristics making it hard or impossible to apply these methods in

perturbation (EWCP) events, it is necessary to have both high cadence
monitoring and high photometric accuracy better than those of current follow-up
observation systems.The next-generation ground-based observation project,
KMTNet (Korea Microlensing Telescope Network), satisfies the conditions. We
estimate the probability of occurrence of EWCP events with fractional
deviations of $\leq 2\%$ in high-magnification events and the efficiency of
detecting planets in the EWCP events using the KMTNet. From this study, we find
that the EWCP events occur with a frequency of $> 50\%$ in the case of
$\lesssim 100\ M_{\rm E}$ planets with separations of $0.2\ {\rm AU} \lesssim d
\lesssim 20\ {\rm AU}$. We find that for main-sequence and subgiant source
stars, $\gtrsim 1\ M_{\rm E}$ planets in EWCP events with the deviations $\leq
2\%$ can be detected $> 50\%$ in a certain range that changes with the planet
mass. However, it is difficult to detect planets in EWCP events of bright stars
like giant stars, because it is easy for KMTNet to be saturated around the peak
of the events with a constant exposure time. EWCP events are caused by close,
intermediate, and wide planetary systems with low-mass planets and close and
wide planetary systems with massive planets. Therefore, we expect that a much

underproduce A<100 and 150<A<165 p-nuclei, or have other limitations. We argue
that the puzzles in these two mechanisms can be solved by heavy-ion spallation.
Spallation happens in the explosive phase transition from a neutron star to a
quark star - the quark-nova. The quark-nova triggers the r-process which
creates abundant A>130 nuclei, and spallation fragments these isotopes into
A<130 nuclei and all 35 p-nuclei. Our model is universal in relation to a
star's age, metallicity, and chemistry.

crystalline silicon has long been used for making infrared lenses and mirrors.
More recently, silicon has become the key material to achieve large-scale
integration of photonic devices for optical interconnect and telecommunication.
For optics, silicon has significant advantages: it offers a very high
refractive index and is highly transparent in the spectral range from 1.2 to 8
micron. To fully exploit silicon's superior performance in a remarkably broad
range and to enable new optoelectronic functionalities, here we describe a
general method to integrate silicon photonic devices on arbitrary substrates.
In particular, we apply the technique to successfully integrate silicon
micro-ring resonators on mid-infrared compatible substrates for operation in
the mid-infrared. These high-performance mid-infrared optical resonators are
utilized to demonstrate, for the first time, on-chip cavity-enhanced
mid-infrared spectroscopic analysis of organic chemicals with a limit of
detection of less than 0.1 ng.

known that conventional PV inverter controllers, which are designed to extract
maximum power at unity power factor, cannot address secondary performance
objectives such as voltage regulation and network loss minimization. Optimal
power flow techniques can be utilized to select which inverters will provide
ancillary services, and to compute their optimal real and reactive power
setpoints. Leveraging advances in semidefinite relaxation techniques and
sparsity-promoting regularizations, such problems can be solved with reduced
computational burden and with optimality guarantees. To enable large-scale
implementation, a novel algorithmic framework is introduced - based on the
so-called alternating direction method of multipliers - by which the optimal
power flow problem in this setting can be systematically decomposed into
sub-problems that can be solved in a decentralized fashion by the utility and
customer-owned PV systems with limited exchanges of information. Since the
computational burden is shared among multiple devices and the requirement of
all-to-all communication can be circumvented, the proposed optimization
approach scales to large distribution networks.

ODE set that accurately approximates the probabilities of subspaces of interest

balanced truncation and can be considerably more computationally efficient than
the Finite State Projection Algorithm (FSP) when used for obtaining transient

infinitesimal generator of a Markov chain that models a reversible,
monomolecular reaction. In such an example, we obtain an approximation of the
output of a model with 301 states by a reduced model with 10 states. Later, we
obtain a reduced order model for a catalytic conversion of substrate to a

simple, effective and robust solution to face recognition. As it gets popular,
doubts on the necessity of enforcing sparsity starts coming up, and primary
experimental results showed that simply changing the $l_1$-norm based
regularization to the computationally much more efficient $l_2$-norm based
non-sparse version would lead to a similar or even better performance. However,
that's not always the case. Given a new classification task, it's still unclear
which regularization strategy (i.e., making the coefficients sparse or
non-sparse) is a better choice without trying both for comparison. In this
paper, we present as far as we know the first study on solving this issue,
based on plenty of diverse classification experiments. We propose a scoring
function for pre-selecting the regularization strategy using only the dataset
size, the feature dimensionality and a discrimination score derived from a
given feature representation. Moreover, we show that when dictionary learning
is taking into account, non-sparse representation has a more significant
superiority to sparse representation. This work is expected to enrich our

classification and motivate further research activities.

  We calculate accurate EC-scattered high-energy spectra produced by
relativistic electrons throughout the Thomson and Klein-Nishina regimes. We
explore the effects of varying the contribution of (1) a thermal
Shakura-Sunyaev accretion disk, (2) a spherically symmetric shell of broad-line
clouds, the broad line region (BLR), and (3) a hot infrared emitting dusty
torus (DT), on the resultant seed photon fields. We let the system evolve to
beyond the BLR and within the DT and study the manifestation of the varying
target photon fields on the simulated SED and lightcurves of a typical blazar.
The calculations of broadband spectra include effects of gamma-gamma absorption
as gamma-rays propagate through the photon pool present inside the jet due to
synchrotron and inverse Compton processes, but neglect gamma-gamma absorption
by the BLR and DT photon fields outside the jet. Thus, our account of

optical spectra of mock stellar systems and observed Galactic Globular Clusters

as templates for the synthesis of deep GGC spectra from Schiavon et al. (2005).
Optimised population synthesis applied to mock spectra recovers mean
light-weighted stellar atmospheric parameters to within a mean uncertainty of
240 K, 0.04 dex, and 0.03 dex for T_eff, log(g), and [Fe/H], respectively.
Decompositions of both mock and GGC spectra confirm the method's ability to
recover the expected mean light-weighted metallicity in dust-free conditions
(E[B-V] < 0.15) with uncertainties comparable to evolutionary population
synthesis methods. Dustier conditions require either appropriate dust-modelling
when fitting to the full spectrum, or fitting only to select spectral features.
We derive light-weighted fractions of stellar evolutionary stages from our

giant and asymptotic giant branch stars, and 15+/-7 per cent from horizontal

expression and pose variations and also by occlusion. This paper presents the
framework for pose adaptive component-based face recognition system. The
framework proposed deals with all the above mentioned issues. The steps
involved in the presented framework are (i) facial landmark localisation, (ii)
facial component extraction, (iii) pre-processing of facial image (iv) facial
pose estimation (v) feature extraction using Local Binary Pattern Histograms of
each component followed by (vi) fusion of pose adaptive classification of
components. By employing pose adaptive classification, the recognition process
is carried out on some part of database, based on estimated pose, instead of
applying the recognition process on the whole database. Pre-processing
techniques employed to overcome the problems due to illumination variation are
also discussed in this paper. Component-based techniques provide better
recognition rates when face images are occluded compared to the holistic
methods. Our method is simple, feasible and provides better results when
compared to other holistic methods.

We prove that $\tau$ is a suffix tree if and only if it is realized by a string

associated to the ubiquitous Ds0* (2317) and the Ds1 (2460). In the baryon

one given by the experimental Lambda_b(5910) and Lambda*_b(5921). Moreover, one
of our states, the Sigma_b*(5904), turns out to be the bottom counterpart of

analyze different transport coefficients for the anti-B meson in hot matter,
such as formed in heavy-ion collisions at RHIC and LHC. For RHIC/LHC energies,
the main contribution to the coefficients comes from the interaction of anti-B
mesons with pions. However, we also include the effects of baryonic density
which might be sizable at temperatures T < 100 MeV, as the chemical potential
is expected to increase in the last stages of the expansion. We conclude that
although the relaxation time decreases with larger baryonic densities, the
anti-B meson does not thermalize at RHIC/LHC energies, representing an ideal
probe for the initial bottom distribution.

  Functions","2 pages, 1 figure",,,,"cs.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Generalizing many well-known and natural scheduling problems, scheduling with
job-specific cost functions has gained a lot of attention recently. In this
setting, each job incurs a cost depending on its completion time, given by a
private cost function, and one seeks to schedule the jobs to minimize the total
sum of these costs. The framework captures many important scheduling objectives
such as weighted flow time or weighted tardiness. Still, the general case as
well as the mentioned special cases are far from being very well understood
yet, even for only one machine. Aiming for better general understanding of this
problem, in this paper we focus on the case of uniform job release dates on one
machine for which the state of the art is a 4-approximation algorithm. This is
true even for a special case that is equivalent to the covering version of the
well-studied and prominent unsplittable flow on a path problem, which is
interesting in its own right. For that covering problem, we present a
quasi-polynomial time $(1+\epsilon)$-approximation algorithm that yields an
$(e+\epsilon)$-approximation for the above scheduling problem. Moreover, for
the latter we devise the best possible resource augmentation result regarding
speed: a polynomial time algorithm which computes a solution with \emph{optimal
}cost at $1+\epsilon$ speedup. Finally, we present an elegant QPTAS for the
special case where the cost functions of the jobs fall into at most $\log n$
many classes. This algorithm allows the jobs even to have up to $\log n$ many
distinct release dates.

start and limited receiver window as well as small average file sizes. (b) We
propose an alternative way for calculating the average connection rate in the
superposition. (c) From the model we propose a way for calculating the queuing
behavior; i.e., the overflow probability. (d) From this last point, we propose
a new link buffer sizing rule. Comparison with extensive simulations shows that
the average rate and duration, as well as, link utilization are accurately
predicted for exponentially distributed file sizes. For longer tail
distributions, the model remains accurate provided the receiver window is
adjusted appropriately. The accuracy increases with increasing load. As
concerns the queuing behavior, the same observation applies. Finally, the
revisited model cannot be used to predict losses larger than about 1%. The
model overestimates loss rates above that threshold.

techniques at the nanoscale lies in the correct alignment of long sequences of

the temporal drift of the protein structure, e.g. due to temporal thermal
inhomogeneity of the object of interest or its supporting area during the
observation process. We develop a simple semiparametric model for drift
correction in SMS microscopy. Then we propose an M-estimator for the drift and
show its asymptotic normality. This is used to correct the final image and it
is shown that this purely statistical method is competitive with state of the
art calibration techniques which require to incorporate fiducial markers into
the specimen. Moreover, a simple bootstrap algorithm allows to quantify the
precision of the drift estimate and its effect on the final image estimation.
We argue that purely statistical drift correction is even more robust than
fiducial tracking rendering the latter superfluous in many applications. The
practicability of our method is demonstrated by a simulation study and by an
SMS application. This serves as a prototype for many other typical imaging
techniques where sparse observations with highly temporal resolution are
blurred by motion of the object to be reconstructed.

feasibility of quantitative hypotheses. One of the most basic applications of
statistical techniques in comparative analysis is the test of equality of two
population means, generally performed under the assumption of normality. In
medical studies, for example, we often need to compare the effects of two
different drugs, treatments or preconditions on the resulting outcome. The most
commonly used test in this connection is the two sample $t$-test for the
equality of means, performed under the assumption of equality of variances. It
is a very useful tool, which is widely used by practitioners of all disciplines
and has many optimality properties under the model. However, the test has one
major drawback; it is highly sensitive to deviations from the ideal conditions,
and may perform miserably under model misspecification and the presence of
outliers. In this paper we present a robust test for the two sample hypothesis
based on the density power divergence measure (Basu et al., 1998), and show
that it can be a great alternative to the ordinary two sample $t$-test. The
asymptotic properties of the proposed tests are rigorously established in the
paper, and their performances are explored through simulations and real data
analysis.

to a small correction of the quantum Fisher information (QFI). On the other
hand a divergence of the QFI appears for very small squeezing in the limit of
vanishing photon number in the case of photon subtraction, implying an
arbitrarily precise measurement with almost no light. However, at least for the
standard and experimentally established preparation scheme, the decreasing
success probability of the preparation in that limit exactly cancels the
divergence, leading to finite sensitivity per square root of Hertz, when the

in situ rheology -- in stationary and oscillatory shear. Two different strains
of the human pathogen Staphylococcus aureus -- strain COL and its isogenic cell
wall autolysis mutant -- were considered in this work. For low bacteria
density, strain COL forms small clusters, while the mutant, presenting
deficient cell separation, forms irregular larger aggregates. In the early
stages of growth, when subjected to a stationary shear, the viscosity of both
strains increases with the population of cells. As the bacteria reach the
exponential phase of growth, the viscosity of the two strains follow different
and rich behaviours, with no counterpart in the optical density or in the
population's colony forming units measurements. While the viscosity of strain
COL keeps increasing during the exponential phase and returns close to its
initial value for the late phase of growth, where the population stabilizes,
the viscosity of the mutant strain decreases steeply, still in the exponential
phase, remains constant for some time and increases again, reaching a constant
plateau at a maximum value for the late phase of growth. These complex
viscoelastic behaviours, which were observed to be shear stress dependent, are
a consequence of two coupled effects: the cell density continuous increase and
its changing interacting properties. The viscous and elastic moduli of strain
COL, obtained with oscillatory shear, exhibit power-law behaviours whose
exponent are dependent on the bacteria growth stage. The viscous and elastic
moduli of the mutant have complex behaviours, emerging from the different
relaxation times that are associated with the large molecules of the medium and
the self-organized structures of bacteria. These behaviours reflect
nevertheless the bacteria growth stage.

of paramount importance to exploit homogeneous data for large samples of
galaxies in different environments. The WINGS (WIde-field Nearby Galaxy-cluster
Survey) project aim is to evaluate physical properties of galaxies in a
complete sample of low redshift clusters to be used as reference sample for
evolutionary studies. The WINGS survey is still ongoing and the original
dataset will soon be enlarged with new observations. This paper presents the
entire collection of WINGS measurements obtained so far. We decided to make use
of the Virtual Observatory (VO) tools to share the WINGS database (that will be
regularly updated) with the community. In the database each object has one
unique identification (WINGSID). Each subset of estimated properties is
accessible using a simple cone search (including wide-field images). We provide
the scientific community the entire set of wide-field images. Furthermore, the
published database contains photometry of 759,024 objects and surface
brightness analysis for 42,275 and 41,463 galaxies in the V and B band,
respectively. The completeness depends on the image quality, and on the cluster
redshift, reaching on average 90% at V<= 21.7. Near infrared photometric
catalogs for 26 (in K) and 19 (in J) clusters are part of the database and the
number of sources is 962,344 in K and 628,813 in J. Here again the completeness
depends on the data quality, but it is on average higher than 90% for J<=20.5
and K<=19.4. The IR subsample with a Sersic fit comprises 71,687 objects. A
morphological classification is available for 39,923 galaxies. We publish
spectroscopic data, including 6,132 redshifts, 5,299 star formation histories
and 4,381 equivalent widths. Finally, a calculation of local density is
presented and implemented in the VO catalogs for 66,164 galaxies.

A theorem of Macaulay dictates the possible growth of the Hilbert function of A

strong consequences have been given by Gotzmann. It can be phrased in terms of
the base locus of the linear system defined by the relevant component(s) of J.
If J is the artinian reduction of the ideal of a finite set of points in
projective space then this maximal growth for A was shown by Bigatti, Geramita

now suppose that the growth of the Hilbert function is one less than maximal.
This again has (not as) strong consequences for the base locus defined by the

user-equipment (UE) at the highest possible rate that the UE can reliably
decode. The eNodeB obtains this rate information as a quantized feedback from
the UE at time n and uses this, for rate selection till the next feedback is
received at time n + {\delta}. The feedback received at n can become outdated
before n + {\delta}, because of a) Doppler fading, and b) Change in the set of
active interferers for a UE. Therefore rate prediction becomes essential.
Since, the rates belong to a discrete set, we propose a discrete sequence
prediction approach, wherein, frequency trees for the discrete sequences are
built using source encoding algorithms like Prediction by Partial Match (PPM).
Finding the optimal depth of the frequency tree used for prediction is cast as
a model order selection problem. The rate sequence complexity is analysed to
provide an upper bound on model order. Information-theoretic criteria are then
used to solve the model order problem. Finally, two prediction algorithms are
proposed, using the PPM with optimal model order and system level simulations
demonstrate the improvement in packet loss and throughput due to these
algorithms.

the structural distortion plays a key role in stabilising the chiral magnetic
structure itself. We have determined the relative contribution of the two
mechanisms via \emph{ab-initio} calculations. Whilst the structural axiality
does induce the magnetic helix by modulating the symmetric exchange
interactions, the electric polarization is largely due to the in-plane spin
triangular chirality, with both electronic and ionic contributions being of
relativistic origin. At the microscopic level, we interpret the polarization as
a secondary steric consequence of the inverse Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya mechanism
and accordingly explain why the ferroaxial component of the electric
polarization must be small.

non-linear ordinary differential equations involving states (concentrations or
amounts of the components of the network) and parameters describing the
reaction kinetics. Unfortunately, in most cases the parameters are completely
unknown or only rough estimates of their values are available. Therefore, their
values must be estimated from time-series experimental data.
  In recent years, it has been suggested that dynamic systems biology models
are universally sloppy so their parameters cannot be uniquely estimated. In
this work, we re-examine this concept, establishing links with the notions of
identifiability and experimental design. Further, considering a set of
examples, we address the following fundamental questions: i) is sloppiness
inherent to model structure?; ii) is sloppiness influenced by experimental data
or noise?; iii) does sloppiness mean that parameters cannot be identified?, and
iv) can sloppiness be modified by experimental design?
  Our results indicate that sloppiness is not equivalent to lack of structural
or practical identifiability (although they can be related), so sloppy models
can be identifiable. Therefore, drawing conclusions about the possibility of
estimating unique parameter values by sloppiness analysis can be misleading.
Checking structural and practical identifiability analyses is a better approach
to asses the uniqueness and confidence in parameter estimation.

$(M,J,\omega)$ and a symplectic form $\sigma$ on $M$ which does not satisfy the
hard Lefschetz property, but is symplectically deformation equivalent to the
K\""ahler form $\omega$.
  As a consequence, we can give an answer to the question posed by Khesin and
McDuff as follows.
  According to symplectic Hodge theory, any symplectic form $\omega$ on a
smooth manifold $M$ defines \textit{symplectic harmonic forms} on $M$.
  In \cite{Yan}, Khesin and McDuff posed a question whether there exists a path
of symplectic forms $\{\omega_t \}$ such that the dimension
$h^k_{hr}(M,\omega)$ of the space of \textit{symplectic harmonic $k$-forms}
varies along $t$.
  By \cite{Yan} and \cite{Ma}, the hard Lefschetz property holds for
$(M,\omega)$ if and only if $h^k_{hr}(M,\omega)$ is equal to the Betti number
$b_k(M)$ for all $k>0$.
  Thus our result gives an answer to the question.
  Also, our construction provides an example of compact K\""ahler manifold whose

these shocks are weak and inefficient accelerators of cosmic rays (CRs), there
are a number of strong, energetic shocks which can produce large amounts of CR
protons via diffusive shock acceleration. We show that the energetic shocks
reside mostly in the outskirts and a substantial fraction of them are induced
by infall of the warm-hot intergalactic medium from filaments. As a result, the
radial profile of the CR pressure in the intracluster medium is expected to be
broad, dropping off more slowly than that of the gas pressure, and might be
even temporarily inverted, peaking in the outskirts. The volume-integrated
momentum spectrum of CR protons inside $r_{200}$ has the power-law slope of
$4.25 - 4.5$, indicating that the average Mach number of the shocks of main CR
production is in the range of $\left< M_s \right>_{\rm CR} \approx 3 - 4$. We

cosmological models. Particular attention is devoted to constraints from the
recent observational determination of the redshift of the cosmological
deceleration-acceleration transition. Making use of the fact that the Ricci
scalar is a function of redshift $z$ in these models, $\mathcal {R=R}(z)$, and
so is $f(z)$, we use cosmography to relate a $f(z)$ test function evaluated at
higher $z$ to late-time cosmographic bounds. First, we consider a model
independent procedure to build up a numerical $f(z)$ by requiring that at $z=0$
the corresponding cosmological model reduces to standard $\Lambda$CDM. We then
infer late-time observational constraints on $f(z)$ in terms of bounds on the
Taylor expansion cosmographic coefficients. In doing so we parameterize
possible departures from the standard $\Lambda$CDM model in terms of a
two-parameter logarithmic correction. The physical meaning of the two
parameters is also discussed in terms of the post Newtonian approximation.
Second, we provide numerical estimates of the cosmographic series terms by
using Type Ia supernova apparent magnitude data and Hubble parameter
measurements. Finally, we use these estimates to bound the two parameters of
the logarithmic correction. We find that the deceleration parameter in our
model changes sign at a redshift consistent with what is observed.

PCA basis, truncate small entries, and update the rotation matrix. Its

scaling linearly with the data dimension. It is easy to choose parameters in
SPCArt, due to its explicit physical explanations. Besides, we give a unified

check whether the data from the output strain channel at the time of an

auxiliary channels. We discuss the results of the application of this veto on
recent LIGO data, and its possible utility when used with data from Advanced

binaries: 4U~0614+091 and 4U~1543$-$624. We confirm the presence of a broad O
VIII Ly$\alpha$ reflection line (at $\approx18\ \AA$) using {\it XMM-Newton}
and {\it Chandra} observations obtained in 2012 and 2013. The donor star in
these sources is carbon-oxygen or oxygen-neon-magnesium white dwarf. Hence, the
accretion disc is enriched with oxygen which makes the O VIII Ly$\alpha$ line
particularly strong. We also confirm the presence of a strong absorption edge
at $\approx14$ \AA\ so far interpreted in the literature as due to absorption
by neutral neon in the circumstellar and interstellar medium. However, the
abundance required to obtain a good fit to this edge is $\approx3-4$ times
solar, posing a problem for this interpretation. Furthermore, modeling the
X-ray reflection off a carbon and oxygen enriched, hydrogen and helium poor
disc with models assuming solar composition likely biases several of the
best-fit parameters. In order to describe the X-ray reflection spectra
self-consistently we modify the currently available {\sc xillver} reflection
model. We present initial grids that can be used to model X-ray reflection
spectra in UCXBs with carbon-oxygen-rich accretion disc. We find that the new
reflection model provides a better overall description of the reflection
spectra of 4U~0614+091 and 4U~1543$-$624 than the reflection models that assume
solar abundances. Besides a strong O VIII Ly$\alpha$ line the new reflection
model also shows a strong O VIII K-edge (at $14.23$ \AA). We find that the
absorption edge at $\approx 14$ \AA\ present in the data can be described by a
O VIII K-edge formed due to reflection in the accretion disc and a Ne I K-edge
originating mostly in the interstellar medium, mitigating the problem of the
apparent very high neon abundance.

CANDELS ultra-deep images of the Ultra Deep Survey field. One of our objects is
detected on the PdBI map with a 4.3 sigma significance, corresponding to
Snu(1.1mm)=(0.78 +/- 0.18) mJy. By combining this detection with the Spitzer 8

we infer that this galaxy is a composite active galactic nucleus/star-forming
system. The infrared (IR)-derived star formation rate is SFR~(200 +/- 100)
Msun/yr, which implies that this galaxy is a higher-redshift analogue of the
ordinary ultra-luminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs) more commonly found at
z~2-3. In the field of the other target, we find a tentative 3.1 sigma
detection on the PdBI 1.1 mm map, but 3.7 arcsec away of our target position,
so it likely corresponds to a different object. In spite of the lower
significance, the PdBI detection is supported by a close SCUBA2 3.3 sigma
detection. No counterpart is found on either the deep SEDS or CANDELS maps, so,
if real, the PdBI source could be similar in nature to the sub-millimetre
source GN10. We conclude that the analysis of ultra-deep near- and mid-IR

star formation activity at high redshifts.

subject to substrate-dependent epitaxial strain. By choosing a proper substrate
for a thin film grow, not only compressing but also tensile strain can be
applied. The consequences for the fundamental physical properties are dramatic:
while compressed films are metallic, as the bulk material, films under tensile
strain become insulating. The goal of this work is to determine the strain
tensor in LSCO films prepared on LaAlO$_3$ and SrTiO$_3$ substrates by pulsed
laser deposition using RBS/channelling methods. Apart from the composition and
defect structure of the samples, the depth dependence of the strain tensor, the
cell parameters, and the volume of the unit cell are also determined.
Asymmetric behaviour of the strained cell parameters is found on both
substrates. This asymmetry is rather weak in the case of LSCO film grown on
LaAlO$_3$, while stronger on SrTiO$_3$ substrate. The strain is more effective

complex environment, consisting of several mildly supersonic filaments

spectral components are evident, moment analysis overestimates the non-thermal
contribution to the line-width by a factor ~2. Large-scale velocity gradients
evident in previous single-dish maps may be explained by the presence of
substructure now evident in the interferometric maps. Whilst global velocity
gradients are small (<0.7 km s^-1 pc^-1), there is evidence for dynamic
processes on local scales (~1.5-2.5 km s^-1 pc^-1 ). Systematic trends in
velocity gradient are observed towards several continuum peaks. This suggests
that the kinematics are influenced by dense (and in some cases, starless)
cores. These trends are interpreted as either infalling material, with
accretion rates ~(7 \pm 4)x10^-5 M_sun yr^-1 , or expanding shells with

radio counterpart of the first near-infrared spiral observed by Fukagawa et al.

spiral arm (S2) lies at the outskirts of the disk and had not been detected
before. It corresponds to a cold density structure, with both brightness and
excitation temperatures of order 13$\pm$2 K and conspicuous in the $^{12}$CO
J=2-1 peak-intensity map, but faint in $^{12}$CO J=3-2. There is also a faint
counterarm (S3), point-symmetrical of S2 with respect to the star. These three
spirals are modelled separately with two different formulae that approximate
the loci of density maxima in acoustic waves due to embedded planets. S1 could
be fit relatively well with these formulae, compared to S2 and S3. Alternative
scenarios such as gravitational instability or external tidal interaction are

Bohm-Dirac model. Its formulation uses a foliation of spacetime into space-like
hypersurfaces. This structure may well arise from the universal wave function
itself, entailing the relativistic character of the theory despite the
appearance of a preferred foliation. However, to apply the theory and to make
contact with the usual quantum formalism one needs a framework for the
description of subsystems. The presence of spin together with the foliation
renders the subsystem description more complicated as compared to the
non-relativistic case with spin. In this paper, we provide such a framework in
terms of an appropriate conditional density matrix and an effective wave
function as well as clarify their relation, thereby generalizing previous
subsystem descriptions in the non-relativistic case.

enhancement in the former. These conditions include the geometry of the

place between lines of differing optical depth. Previous observational studies

commonplace in modern aberrationcorrected transmission electron microscopes.
Energy resolution has also been increasing steadily with the continuous
improvement of electron monochromators. Electronic excitations however are
known to be delocalised due to the long range interaction of the charged
accelerated electrons with the electrons in a sample. This has made several
scientists question the value of combined high spatial and energy resolution
for mapping interband transitions and possibly phonon excitation in crystals.
In this paper we demonstrate experimentally that atomic resolution information
is indeed available at very low energy losses around 100 meV expressed as a
modulation of the broadening of the zero loss peak. Careful data analysis
allows us to get a glimpse of what are likely phonon excitations with both an
energy loss and gain part. These experiments confirm recent theoretical
predictions on the strong localisation of phonon excitations as opposed to
electronic excitations and show that a combination of atomic resolution and
recent developments in increased energy resolution will offer great benefit for
mapping phonon modes in real space.
