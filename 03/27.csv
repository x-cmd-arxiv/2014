pure spin current source. The device consists of two mesoscopic capacitors
attached to a two-dimensional strip of a topological insulator. The change from
charge to spin current is controlled by an offset in the top gate potentials
that drive the capacitors. In addition to this setup, which anticipates the
experimental realisation of quantum point contacts in topological insulators,
we propose an analogous source in the quantum Hall regime which only relies on
presently available building blocks. To this end, we calculate the band
structure of a topological insulator in a magnetic field. The intrinsic
spin-orbit coupling, together with a split gate, allows for an analogous
source, where charge and spin current can be manipulated. The realisation of
the device as well as the detection of the ac spin current are within reach of
present experimental technology.

places constraints on the orientation of the orbital axis with respect to the
stellar spin axis, which can shed light on the mechanisms shaping the orbital
configuration of planetary systems. Here we present the interesting case of the
Saturn-mass planet HAT-P-18b, which orbits one of the coolest stars for which
the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect has been measured so far. We acquired a
spectroscopic time-series, spanning a full transit, with the HARPS-N
spectrograph mounted at the TNG telescope. The very precise radial velocity
measurements delivered by the HARPS-N pipeline were used to measure the
Rossiter-McLaughlin effect. Complementary new photometric observations of
another full transit were also analysed to obtain an independent determination
of the star and planet parameters. We find that HAT-P-18b lies on a
counter-rotating orbit, the sky-projected angle between the stellar spin axis
and the planet orbital axis being lambda=132 +/- 15 deg. By joint modelling of
the radial velocity and photometric data we obtain new determinations of the
star (M_star = 0.770 +/- 0.027 M_Sun; R_star= 0.717 +/- 0.026 R_Sun;
Vsin(I_star) = 1.58 +/- 0.18 km/s) and planet (M_pl = 0.196 +/- 0.008 M_J; R_pl
= 0.947 +/- 0.044 R_J) parameters. Our spectra provide for the host star an
effective temperature T_eff = 4870 +/- 50 K, a surface gravity of log(g_star) =
4.57 +/- 0.07 cm/s, and an iron abundance of [Fe/H] = 0.10 +/- 0.06. HAT-P-18b
is one of the few planets known to transit a star with T_eff < 6250 K on a
retrograde orbit. Objects such as HAT-P-18b (low planet mass and/or relatively
long orbital period) most likely have a weak tidal coupling with their parent
stars, therefore their orbits preserve any original misalignment. As such, they
are ideal targets to study the causes of orbital evolution in cool
main-sequence stars.

a scaling description of the yielding transition in amorphous solids made of
soft particles at zero temperature. Our description makes a connection between
the Herschel-Bulkley expo- nent characterizing the singularity of the flow

avalanches of plasticity observed at threshold, and the density P(x) of soft
spots, or shear transformation zones, as a function of the stress increment x

transition can be expressed in terms of three independent exponents {\theta},
df and z, characterizing respectively the density of soft spots, the fractal
dimension of the avalanches, and their duration. Our description shares some
similarity with the depinning transition that occurs when an elastic manifold
is driven through a random potential, but also presents some striking
differences. We test our arguments in an elasto-plastic model, an automaton
model similar to those used in depinning, but with a different interaction
kernel, and find satisfying agreement with our predictions both in two and

the secondary model the emission is more spatially extended than in some
observed minihalos. We also explore the effect of rapid changes in the magnetic

steeper than expected from stationary conditions, the change is marginal, with
differences in the synchrotron spectral index of $\Delta\alpha$ < 0.15-0.25,

between continuum vs. line opacity, this chapter reviews instabilities in the
envelopes and winds of VMS. Specifically, we discuss how: 1) the iron opacity
bump can induce an extensive inflation of the stellar envelope; 2) the density
dependence of mean opacity leads to strange mode instabilities in the outer
envelope; 3) desaturation of line-opacity by acceleration of near-surface
layers initiates and sustains a line-driven stellar wind outflow; 4) an
associated line-deshadowing instability leads to extensive small-scale
structure in the outer regions of such line-driven winds; 5) a star with
super-Eddington luminosity can develop extensive atmospheric structure from
photon bubble instabilities, or from stagnation of flow that exceeds the
""photon tiring"" limit; 6) the associated porosity leads to a reduction in
opacity that can regulate the extreme mass loss of such continuum-driven winds.
Two overall themes are the potential links of such instabilities to Luminous
Blue Variable (LBV) stars, and the potential role of radiation forces in
establishing the upper mass limit of VMS.

a single charge or exciton. The parameter regimes chosen, namely the adiabatic
regime, $\hbar\omega/4t_0 = \omega' < 1$, and the `large' polaron regime,
$\lambda < 1$, are applicable to most conjugated polymers. We show that as a
consequence of the polaron effective mass diverging in the adiabatic limit
(defined as $\omega' \to 0$ subject to fixed $\lambda$) self-localized,
symmetry breaking solutions are predicted by the quantum Holstein model for
infinitesimal disorder -- in complete agreement with the predictions of the
Born-Oppenheimer Holstein model. For other parts of the ($\omega'$, $\lambda$)
parameter space, however, self-localized Born-Oppenheimer solutions are not
expected. If $\omega'$ is not small enough and $\lambda$ is not large enough,
then the polaron is predominately localized by Anderson disorder, albeit more
than for a free particle, because of the enhanced effective mass.
Alternatively, for very small electron-nuclear coupling ($\lambda \ll 1$) the
disorder-induced localization length is always smaller than the classical
polaron size, $2/\lambda$, so that disorder always dominates. We comment on the
implication of our results on the electronic properties of conjugated polymers.

from the neutron star atmosphere and a hard power-law tail of unknown origin.
We report here on a simultaneous observation of Cen X-4 with NuSTAR (3-79 keV)

the first time such a feature has been detected in this source class. We show
that thermal Comptonization and synchrotron shock origins for the hard X-ray

well fit by a thermal bremsstrahlung model with an 18 keV electron temperature,
which can be understood as arising either in a hot layer above the neutron star
atmosphere or in a radiatively-inefficient accretion flow (RIAF). The power-law
cutoff energy may be set by the degree of Compton cooling of the bremsstrahlung
electrons by thermal seed photons from the neutron star surface. Lower thermal
luminosities should lead to higher (possibly undetectable) cutoff energies. We
compare Cen~X-4's behavior with PSR J1023+0038, IGR J18245-2452, and XSS

confirmed, it has dramatic implications for models of inflation. The result is
also in tension with Planck limits on standard inflationary models. It is
therefore important to investigate whether this signal can arise from
alternative sources. If so, this could lessen the pressure on inflationary
models and the tension with Planck data. We investigate whether vector and
tensor modes from primordial magnetic fields can explain the signal. We find
that in principle, magnetic fields generated during inflation can indeed
produce the required B-mode, for a suitable range of energy scales of
inflation. In this case, the primordial gravitational wave amplitude is
negligible, so that there is no tension with Planck and no problems posed for
current inflationary models. However, the simplest magnetic model is in tension
with Planck limits on non-Gaussianity in the trispectrum. It may be possible to
fine-tune the magnetogenesis model so that this non-Gaussianity is suppressed.
Alternatively, a weaker magnetic field can pass the non-Gaussianity constraints
and allow the primordial tensor mode to be reduced to r~0.09, thus removing the

spin period by a $10^8$ - $10^9$ yr long X-ray-bright phase of accretion of
matter and angular momentum in a low-to-intermediate mass binary system.
Recently, the discovery of transitional pulsars that alternate cyclically
between accretion and rotation-powered states on time scales of a few years or
shorter, has demonstrated this evolutionary scenario. Here, we present a
thorough statistical analysis of the spin distributions of the various classes
of millisecond pulsars to assess the evolution of their spin period between the
different stages. Accreting sources that showed oscillations exclusively during
thermonuclear type I X-ray bursts (nuclear-powered millisecond pulsars) are
found to be significantly faster than rotation-powered sources, while accreting
sources that possess a magnetosphere and show coherent pulsations (accreting
millisecond pulsars) are not. On the other hand, if accreting millisecond
pulsars and eclipsing rotation-powered millisecond pulsars form a common class
of transitional pulsars, these are shown to have a spin distribution
intermediate between the faster nuclear-powered millisecond pulsars and the
slower non-eclipsing rotation-powered millisecond pulsars. We interpret these
findings in terms of a spin-down due to the decreasing mass-accretion rate
during the latest stages of the accretion phase, and in terms of the different
orbital evolutionary channels mapped by the various classes of pulsars. We
summarize possible instrumental selection effects, showing that even if an
unbiased sample of pulsars is still lacking, their influence on the results of
the presented analysis is reduced by recent improvements in instrumentation and
searching techniques.

generally give rise to a shear-rate dependent rheology. In particular,
pronounced shear thickening may be observed at large solid volume fractions. In
a recent article (R. Seto, R. Mari, J. F. Morris, and M. M. Denn., Phys. Rev.
Lett., 111:218301, 2013) we have considered the minimum set of components to
reproduce the experimentally observed shear thickening behavior, including
Discontinuous Shear Thickening (DST). We have found frictional contact forces
to be essential, and were able to reproduce the experimental behavior by a
simulation including this physical ingredient along with viscous lubrication.
In the present article, we thoroughly investigate the effect of friction and
express it in the framework of the jamming transition. The viscosity divergence
at the jamming transition has been a well known phenomenon in suspension
rheology, as reflected in many empirical laws for the viscosity. Friction can
affect this divergence, and in particular the jamming packing fraction is
reduced if particles are frictional. Within the physical description proposed
here, shear thickening is a direct consequence of this effect: as the shear
rate increases, friction is increasingly incorporated as more contacts form,
leading to a transition from a mostly frictionless to a mostly frictional
rheology. This result is significant because it shifts the emphasis from
lubrication hydrodynamics and detailed microscopic interactions to geometry and
steric constraints close to the jamming transition.

of a trajectory point cloud for classifying unique actions, encoded in a
spatio-temporal covariant eigenspace, where each point is characterized by its
spatial location, local Frenet-Serret vector basis, time averaged curvature and
torsion and the mean osculating hyperplane. Since each action can be
distinguished by their unique trajectories within this space, the trajectory
point cloud is used to define an adaptive distance metric for classifying
queries against stored actions. Depending upon the distance to other
trajectories, the distance metric uses either large scale structure of the
trajectory point cloud, such as the mean distance between cloud centroids or
the difference in hyperplane orientation, or small structure such as the time
averaged curvature and torsion, to classify individual points in a fuzzy-KNN.
Our system can function in real-time and has an accuracy greater than 93% for
multiple action recognition within video repositories. We demonstrate the use
of our CBVR system in two situations: by locating specific frame positions of
trained actions in two full featured films, and video shot retrieval from a
database with a web search application.

is by now well-known that this puts stringent constraints on the sequestered
Large Volume Scenario (LVS), i.e. on LVS realisations with the Standard Model
at a singularity. We go beyond this setting by considering LVS models where SM
fields are realised on 7-branes in the geometric regime. As we argue, this
naturally goes together with high-scale supersymmetry. The abundance of Dark
Radiation is determined by the competition between the decay of the lightest
modulus to axions, to the SM Higgs and to gauge fields. The latter decay
channel avoids the most stringent constraints of the sequestered setting.
Nevertheless, a rather robust prediction for a substantial amount of Dark
Radiation can be made. This applies both to cases where the SM 4-cycles are
stabilised by D-terms and are small ""by accident"" as well as to fibred models
with the small cycles stabilised by loops. Furthermore, we analyse a closely
related setting where the SM lives at a singularity but couples to the volume
modulus through flavour branes. We conclude that some of the most natural LVS
settings with natural values of model parameters lead to Dark Radiation
predictions just below the present observational limits. Barring a discovery,
rather modest improvements of present Dark Radiation bounds can rule out many
of these most simple and generic variants of the LVS.

long-range gravitational scattering of planetesimals from its cold outer
regions. Planetesimals are scattered progressively inward by a system of 5-7
planets from 30-60 AU to very close-in. In successful simulations the outermost
planets are typically Neptune-mass. The back-reaction of planetesimal
scattering causes these planets to migrate outward and continually interact
with fresh planetesimals, replenishing the source of scattered bodies. The most
favorable cases for producing Vega's exo-zodi have negative radial mass
gradients, with sub-Saturn- to Jupiter-mass inner planets at 5-10 AU and outer
planets of 2.5 to 20 Earth masses. The mechanism fails if a Jupiter-sized
planet exists beyond ~15 AU because the planet preferentially ejects
planetesimals before they can reach the inner system. Direct-imaging planet
searches can therefore directly test this mechanism.

area-changing. A plate of aspect ratio 3 is used to model a bat wing and a
three dimensional unsteady panel method is applied to predict the aerodynamic

the lift, followed by area-changing model and then the bending model. The
further study indicates that the vortex control is a main mechanism to produce
high aerodynamic forces, and the mechanisms for the aerodynamic force
enhancement are the asymmetry of the cambered wing and the amplifier effects of
wing area-changing and wing bending. The lift and thrust are mainly generated
during the downstroke and almost negligible forces during the upstroke by the

orbit-averaged mass loss rates. The model is extremely fast, treats subhaloes
of all orders, accounts for scatter in orbital properties and halo
concentrations, and uses a simple recipe to convert subhalo mass to maximum

velocity functions in numerical simulations. The inferred subhalo mass loss
rates imply that an average dark matter subhalo loses in excess of 80 percent

with a different power spectrum but the same initial white noise field. Our
fiducial simulation is based on parameters from the WMAP 7th year cosmology. We
then systematically vary the spectral index, $n_s$, matter density, $\Omega_M$,
and normalization of the power spectrum, $\sigma_8$, for 7 unique simulations.
Across these, we study variations in the subhalo mass function, mass fraction,
maximum circular velocity function, spatial distribution, concentration,
formation times, accretion times, and peak mass. We eliminate dependence of
subhalo properties on host halo mass and average over many hosts to reduce
variance. While the ""same"" subhalos from identical initial overdensity peaks in
higher $\sigma_8, n_s$, and $\Omega_m$ simulations accrete earlier and end up
less massive and closer to the halo center at $z=0$, the process of continuous
subhalo accretion and destruction leads to a steady state distribution of these
properties across all subhalos in a given host. This steady state mechanism
eliminates cosmological dependence on all properties listed above except
subhalo concentration and $V_{max}$, which remain greater for higher $\sigma_8,
n_s$ and $\Omega_m$ simulations, and subhalo formation time, which remains

exchange of the Virasoro identity block, primary states above the BTZ threshold
mimic a thermal background for light operators. We derive the BTZ quasi-normal

very few known short-period planets orbiting a hot A-type star, making it one
of the hottest planets currently known. The availability of Kepler data allows
us to measure the planet's occultation (secondary eclipse) and phase curve in
the optical, which we combine with occultations observed by warm Spitzer at 4.5
mic and 3.6 mic and a ground-based occultation observation in the Ks band (2.1
mic). We derive a day-side hemisphere temperature of 2,750 +- 160 K as the
effective temperature of a black body showing the same occultation depths.
Comparing the occultation depths with one-dimensional planetary atmosphere
models suggests the presence of an atmospheric temperature inversion. Our
analysis shows evidence for a relatively high geometric albedo, Ag= 0.33 +0.04
-0.06. While measured with a simplistic method, a high Ag is supported also by
the fact that the one-dimensional atmosphere models underestimate the
occultation depth in the optical. We use stellar spectra to determine the
dilution, in the four wide bands where occultation was measured, due to the
visual stellar binary companion 1.15 +- 0.05"" away. The revised stellar
parameters measured using these spectra are combined with other measurements
leading to revised planetary mass and radius estimates of Mp = 4.94 - 8.09 Mjup
and Rp = 1.406 +- 0.038 Rjup. Finally, we measure a Kepler mid-occultation time

such as the Baldwin-Phillips-Terlevich (BPT) diagram, have been used
extensively to distinguish AGN from purely star-forming galaxies. Yet, they
remain poorly understood at higher redshifts. We shed light on this issue with
an empirical approach based on a z~0 reference sample built from ~300,000 SDSS
galaxies, from which we mimic selection effects due to typical emission line
detection limits at higher redshift. We combine this low-redshift reference
sample with a simple prescription for luminosity evolution of the global galaxy
population to predict the loci of high-redshift galaxies on the BPT and
Mass-Excitation (MEx) diagnostic diagrams. The predicted bivariate
distributions agree remarkably well with direct observations of galaxies out to
z~1.5, including the observed stellar mass-metallicity (MZ) relation evolution.
As a result, we infer that high-redshift star-forming galaxies are consistent
with having ""normal"" ISM properties out to z~1.5, after accounting for
selection effects and line luminosity evolution. Namely, their optical line
ratios and gas-phase metallicities are comparable to that of low-redshift
galaxies with equivalent emission-line luminosities. In contrast, AGN
narrow-line regions may show a shift toward lower metallicities at higher
redshift. While a physical evolution of the ISM conditions is not ruled out for
purely star-forming galaxies, and may be more important starting at z>2, we
find that reliably quantifying this evolution is hindered by selections
effects. The recipes provided here may serve as a basis for future studies
toward this goal. Code to predict the loci of galaxies on the BPT and MEx
diagnostic diagrams, and the MZ relation as a function of emission line
luminosity limits, is made publicly available.

function of time, observing variations due to absorption from the planetary
atmosphere during transit. This analysis permits us to derive information about
atmospheric extent, mass-loss rate from the planet, and interactions between
the star and planet. We observe an evolution of the Lyman-$\alpha$ lightcurve
with a transit depth of GJ436b from $8.8\pm4.5\%$ near mid-transit, to
$22.9\pm3.9\%$ $\sim2$ hours after the nominal geometric egress of the planet.
Using data from the time-tag mode and considering astrophysical noise from
stellar variability, we calculate a post-egress occultation of $23.7\pm4.5\%$,
demonstrating that the signature is statistically significant and of greater
amplitude than can be attributed to stellar fluctuations alone. The extended
egress absorption indicates the probable existence of a comet-like tail
trailing the exoplanet. We calculate a mass-loss rate for GJ436b in the range
of $3.7\times10^6 -1.1\times10^{9}$ g s$^{-1}$, corresponding to an atmospheric

We find that subhalo mass functions (SHMFs) obtained using different subhalo

mass end. At the massive end, subhalo finders that identify subhaloes based
purely on density in configuration space dramatically underpredict the subhalo
abundances by more than an order of magnitude. These problems are much less
severe for subhalo velocity functions (SHVFs), indicating that they arise from
issues related to assigning masses to the subhaloes, rather than from detecting
them. Overall the predictions from the semi-analytical model are in excellent
agreement with simulation results obtained using the more advanced subhalo
finders that use information in six dimensional phase-space. In particular, the
model accurately reproduces the slope and host-mass-dependent normalization of
both the subhalo mass and velocity functions. We find that the SHMFs and SHVFs

  Social Contagions","To appear at ICSWM '14",,,,"cs.SI physics.soc-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Information overload has become an ubiquitous problem in modern society.
Social media users and microbloggers receive an endless flow of information,
often at a rate far higher than their cognitive abilities to process the
information. In this paper, we conduct a large scale quantitative study of
information overload and evaluate its impact on information dissemination in
the Twitter social media site. We model social media users as information
processing systems that queue incoming information according to some policies,
process information from the queue at some unknown rates and decide to forward
some of the incoming information to other users. We show how timestamped data
about tweets received and forwarded by users can be used to uncover key
properties of their queueing policies and estimate their information processing
rates and limits. Such an understanding of users' information processing
behaviors allows us to infer whether and to what extent users suffer from
information overload.
  Our analysis provides empirical evidence of information processing limits for
social media users and the prevalence of information overloading. The most
active and popular social media users are often the ones that are overloaded.
Moreover, we find that the rate at which users receive information impacts
their processing behavior, including how they prioritize information from
different sources, how much information they process, and how quickly they
process information. Finally, the susceptibility of a social media user to
social contagions depends crucially on the rate at which she receives
information. An exposure to a piece of information, be it an idea, a convention
or a product, is much less effective for users that receive information at
higher rates, meaning they need more exposures to adopt a particular contagion.

possible if early treatment with ART becomes available to all. We fit a dynamic

incidence, mortality and the impact of ART. The availability of ART has reduced
the prevalence of HIV among adults not on ART from 4.2% to 2.9%, annual

is still an open question. In this paper, we analysed a sample of such galaxies
to study the central region in terms of nuclear and circumnuclear emission
lines, as well as the stellar component properties. For this reason, we
selected 10 massive ($\sigma$ > 200 km/s) nearby (d < 31 Mpc) galaxies and
observed them with the IFU/GMOS (integral field unit/Gemini Multi-Object
Spectrograph) spectrograph on the Gemini South Telescope. The data were
analysed with principal component analysis (PCA) Tomography to assess the main
properties of the objects. Two spectral regions were analysed: a yellow region
(5100-5800 A), adequate to show the properties of the stellar component, and a
red region (6250-6800 A), adequate to analyse the gaseous component. We found
that all objects previously known to present emission lines have a central
AGN-type emitting source. They also show gaseous and stellar kinematics typical
of discs. Such discs may be co-aligned (NGC 1380 and ESO 208 G-21), in
counter-rotation (IC 1459 and NGC 7097) or misaligned (IC 5181 and NGC 4546).
We also found one object with a gaseous disc but no stellar disc (NGC 2663),
one with a stellar disc but no gaseous disc (NGC 1404), one with neither
stellar nor gaseous disc (NGC 1399) and one with probably ionization cones (NGC
3136). PCA Tomography is an efficient method for detecting both the central AGN
and gaseous and stellar discs. In the two cases (NGC 1399 and NGC 1404) in
which no lines were previously reported, we found no evidence of either nuclear
or circumnuclear emission, using PCA Tomography only.

is a unique alternative to a traditional etalon, as the interferometric cavity
is made of single-mode fiber rather than an air-gap spacer. This design allows
for excellent collimation, high spectral finesse, rigid mechanical stability,
insensitivity to vibrations, and no need for vacuum operation. The device we
have tested is a commercially available product from Micron Optics. Our
development path is targeted towards a calibration source for the
Habitable-Zone Planet Finder (HPF), a near-infrared spectrograph designed to
detect terrestrial-mass planets around low-mass stars, but this reference could
also be used in many existing and planned fiber-fed spectrographs as we
illustrate using the Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment
(APOGEE) instrument. With precise temperature control of the fiber etalon, we
achieve a thermal stability of 100 $\mu$K and associated velocity uncertainty
of 22 cm s$^{-1}$. We achieve a precision of $\approx$2 m s$^{-1}$ in a single
APOGEE fiber over 12 hours using this new photonic reference after removal of
systematic correlations. This high precision (close to the expected
photon-limited floor) is a testament to both the excellent intrinsic wavelength
stability of the fiber interferometer and the stability of the APOGEE
instrument design. Overall instrument velocity precision is 80 cm s$^{-1}$ over
12 hours when averaged over all 300 APOGEE fibers and after removal of known
trends and pressure correlations, implying the fiber etalon is intrinsically
stable to significantly higher precision.

fundamental problem with trans-Planckian excursions of the inflaton field up to
about 100 Planck masses, with the upper bound coming from the corpuscular
quantum effects. In this description the r-parameter measures the ratio of
occupation numbers of gravitons versus inflatons, which, according to BICEP2,
was roughly a half at the time of 60 e-foldings prior to the end of inflation.
We stress that in non-Wilsonian UV self-completion of gravity any
trans-Planckian mode coupled to inflaton is a black hole. Unlike the Wilsonian
case, their integration-out gives an exponentially-suppressed effect and is
unable to prevent trans-Planckian excursions of the inflaton field.

$[n]^d$ on $L$ gets infected, and we repeat this until the infection can no
longer spread. The elements of the set $A$ are usually chosen independently,
with some density $p$, and the main question is to determine $p_c(n,r,d)$, the
density at which percolation (infection of the entire grid) becomes likely. In
this paper, we determine $p_c(n,r,2)$ up to a multiplicative factor of $1+o(1)$

a method to search for candidate LBVs using both optical color from the Local

  It is shown in \cite{P. Booth6} that these spaces have applications to
several topics in homotopy theory. These such results are given in complete

  The usual argument is in the context of the usually category of all

spatial patterns from animal-habitat interaction mechanisms are vital for
predicting the population-level effects of such changes.
  2. Environmental perturbations are particularly prevalent in the Amazon
rainforest, and have a profound effect on fragmentation-sensitive insectivorous
bird flocks. Therefore it is important to be able to predict the effects of
such changes on the flocks' space-use patterns.
  3. We use a step selection function (SSF) approach to uncover environmental
drivers behind movement choices. This is used to construct a mechanistic model,
from which we derive predicted utilization distributions (home ranges) of
flocks.
  4. We show that movement decisions are significantly influenced by canopy
height and topography, but not resource depletion and renewal. We quantify the
magnitude of these effects and demonstrate that they are helpful for
understanding various heterogeneous aspects of space use. We compare our
results to recent analytic derivations of space use, demonstrating that they
are only accurate when assuming that there is no persistence in the animals'
movement.
  5. Our model can be translated into other environments or hypothetical
scenarios, such as those given by proposed future anthropogenic actions, to
make predictions of spatial patterns in bird flocks. Furthermore, our approach
is quite general, so could be used to predict the effects of habitat changes on

generating PseudoRandom Numbers (PRNs) from common statistical distributions.
The algorithm divides a distribution into rectangular layers that stack on top
of each other (resembling a Ziggurat), subsuming the desired distribution.
Random values within these rectangular layers are then sampled by rejection.
This implementation splits layers into two types: those constituting the
majority that fall completely under the distribution and can be sampled
extremely fast without a rejection test, and a few additional layers that
encapsulate the fringe of the distribution and require a rejection test. This
method offers speedups of 65% for exponentially- and 82% for
normally-distributed PRNs when compared to the best available C implementations
of these generators. Even greater speedups are obtained when the algorithm is
extended to the Python and MATLAB/OCTAVE programming environments.

stars lacking strong convection zones or massive winds remains poorly
understood, and the possible role of hidden, lower mass close companions is
still unclear. A 20ks Chandra HRC-I observation of HR 4796A, an 8 Myr old main
sequence A0 star devoid of close stellar companions, has been used to search
for a signature or remnant of magnetic activity from the Herbig Ae phase.
X-rays were not detected and the X-ray luminosity upper limit was L_X =<
1.3x10^27 erg/s. The result is discussed in the context of various scenarios
for generating magnetic activity, including rotational shear and subsurface
convection. A dynamo driven by natal differential rotation is unlikely to
produce observable X rays, chiefly because of the difficulty in getting the
dissipated energy up to the surface of the star. A subsurface convection layer
produced by the ionisation of helium could host a dynamo that should be
effective throughout the main-sequence but can only produce X-ray luminosities
of order 10^25 erg/s. This luminosity lies only moderately below the current
detection limit for Vega. Our study supports the idea that X-ray production in
Herbig Ae/Be stars is linked largely to the accretion process rather than the
properties of the underlying star, and that early A stars generally decline in
X-ray luminosity at least 100,000 fold in only a few million years.

into a continuum of modes. A major goal which has remained elusive so far, is
therefore to realise a long-lived Higgs mode in a controllable system. Here, we
show how an undamped Higgs mode can be observed unambiguously in a Fermi gas in
a two-dimensional trap, close to a quantum phase transition between a normal

the associated collective modes, which is quantitatively reliable when the

to allow the derivation of analytical results. The theory includes the trapping

using a rigorous charge conserving current deposition method to maintain the
validity of Gauss's law. We show that this algorithm is a hybrid method which
uses a particles-in-cell description in r-z and a gridless description in
$\phi$. We include the ability to keep an arbitrary number of harmonics and
higher order particle shapes. Examples, for laser wakefield acceleration,
plasma wakefield acceleration, and beam loading are also presented and

in the major observable molecules, making these elements diagnostic of

and oxygen abundances in 16 stars that host transiting hot Jupiter exoplanets,
and compare our C/O ratios to those measured in larger samples of host stars,
as well as those estimated for the corresponding exoplanet atmospheres. With
standard stellar abundance analysis we derive stellar parameters as well as
[C/H] and [O/H] from multiple abundance indicators, including synthesis fitting
of the [O I] 6300 {\AA} line and NLTE corrections for the O I triplet. Our
results, in agreement with recent suggestions, indicate that
previously-measured exoplanet host star C/O ratios may have been overestimated.
The mean transiting exoplanet host star C/O ratio from this sample is 0.54
(C/O$_{solar}$=0.54), versus previously-measured C/O$_{host~star}$ means of
$\sim$0.65-0.75. We also observe the increase in C/O with [Fe/H] expected for
all stars based on Galactic chemical evolution; a linear fit to our results
falls slightly below that of other exoplanet host stars studies but has a
similar slope. Though the C/O ratios of even the most-observed exoplanets are
still uncertain, the more precise abundance analysis possible right now for
their host stars can help constrain these planets' formation environments and
current compositions.

actively cool the jet. In this letter, we demonstrate that if cooling
significantly increases the compressibility of the flow, the turbulence
collides with the forward shock, destabilizing and corrugating it. In this
case, the forward shock is turbulent enough to produce the magnetic fields
responsible for synchrotron emission via small scale turbulent dynamo. We
calculate light curves assuming the magnetic field is in energy equipartition
with the turbulent kinetic energy and discover that dynamic magnetic fields are
well-approximated by a constant magnetic-to- thermal energy ratio of 1%, though
there is a sizeable delay in the time of peak flux as the magnetic field turns
on only after the turbulence has activated. The reverse shock is found to be
significantly more magnetized than the forward shock, with a
magnetic-to-thermal energy ratio of order 10%. This work motivates future
Rayleigh-Taylor calculations using more physical cooling models.

use the standard technique based on the factorization properties of mass
singularities in the light-cone axial gauge \cite{EGMPR79,CFP80} but we propose
a modification to this approach by introducing a New Principal Value
prescription \cite{GJKS14} in which we use the PV prescription for
regularization of {\em all} singularities in the light-cone plus components of
the four-momenta. The main advantage of the NPV prescription is that exclusive
splitting functions calculated with its help can be used for construction of
the Monte-Carlo parton showers. The reason for this is that in the NPV
prescription some of the higher order poles in dimensional $\epsilon$ parameter
are replaced by the logarithms of a cut-off parameter $\delta$ which has a
geometrical meaning in four dimensions. As a consequence, cancellation of the
higher order poles between real and virtual components is reduced. On the other
hand, at the inclusive level the NPV results agree with the results in the
standard PV prescription which shows compatibility of both approaches.
  With the help of the NPV prescription, we calculate virtual one-loop
contributions to the NLO non-singlet splitting function $P_{q\to q}^{NLO}$ and
selected contributions to the singlet $P_{g\to g}^{NLO}$ one. We also discuss
the dependence of the results on the choice of the integration variable related
to the evolution time in Monte Carlo parton showers. Finally, we present the

broken-symmetry phase. Accordingly, a multiple-bifurcation of the quantum
groundstate fidelity is shown to occur as the transverse magnetic field varies
from the symmetry phase to the broken-symmetry phase, which means that a
multiple-bifurcation point corresponds to a critical point. A (dis-)continuous
behavior of quantum fidelity at phase transition points characterizes a
(dis-)continuous phase transition. Similar to the characteristic behavior of
the quantum fidelity, the magnetizations, as order parameters, obtained from
the degenerate groundstates exhibit multiple bifurcation at critical points.
Each order parameter is also explicitly demonstrated to transform under the
subgroup of the Zq symmetry group. We find that the q-state quantum Potts model

a given number of points that, heuristically, takes polynomial time for most
input values. We illustrate the practical applicability of this algorithm by
constructing a genus-2 curve having exactly 10^2014 + 9703 (prime) points, and
two genus-2 curves each having exactly 10^2013 points.
  In an appendix we provide a complete parametrization, over an arbitrary base
field k of characteristic neither 2 nor 3, of the family of genus-2 curves over
k that have k-rational degree-3 maps to elliptic curves, including formulas for
the genus-2 curves, the associated elliptic curves, and the degree-3 maps.

users to relay information to each other, without access to the cellular
network. In this paper, we consider how to dynamically select multi-hop routes
for D2D communications in spectrum co-existence with a fully loaded cellular
network. The modelling scenario is that of a real urban environment, when the
cellular network is congested during an unexpected event, such as a terrorist
attack. We use D2D to relay data across the urban terrain, in the presence of
conventional cellular (CC) communications.
  We consider different wireless routing algorithms, namely:
shortest-path-routing (SPR), interference-aware-routing (IAR), and
broadcast-routing (BR). In general, there is a fundamental trade-off between
D2D and CC outage performances, due to their mutual interference relationship.
For different CC outage constraints and D2D end-to-end distances, the paper
recommends different D2D routing strategies. The paper also considers the
effects of varying user density and urban building material properties on
overall D2D relaying feasibility. Over a distance of a kilometre, it was found
that the success probability of D2D communications can reach 91% for a moderate
participating user density (400 per square km) and a low wall penetration loss
(<10dB).

dynamic polarizabilites including the effect of hyperfine structure are then
calculated in a full three-body approach to get a precise evaluation of the

from previous works, these results provide a realistic estimate of the
achievable accuracy. We show that the lightshift is the main limiting factor in
the case of two-photon transitions, both in H2+ and HD+, leading to expected

evidence or conforms to procedures taught. However, learners develop a
knowledge which they can apply in significant problem situations, and which is
amenable to falsification and argumentation. They can validate what they claim
to be true but using means generally not conforming to mathematical standards.
Here, I analyze how this situation underlies the epistemological and didactical
complexities of teaching mathematical proof. I show that the evolution of the
learners' understanding of what counts as proof in mathematics implies an
evolution of their knowing of mathematical concepts. The key didactical point
is not to persuade learners to accept a new formalism but to have them
understand how mathematical proof and statements are tightly related within a
common framework; that is, a mathematical theory. I address this aim by
modeling the learners' way of knowing in terms of a dynamic, homeostatic
system. I discuss the roles of different semiotic systems, of the types of
actions the learners perform and of the controls they implement in constructing
or validating knowledge. Particularly with modern technological aids, this
model provides a basis designing didactical situations to help learners bridge
the gap between pragmatics and theory.

the proposed scheduling-and-beamforming method almost achieves the performance
of the existing semi-orthogonal user selection with ZFBF (SUS-ZFBF) that
requires full CSI feedback from all users, with significantly reduced feedback
overhead which is even less than that required by random beamforming.

estimated model in minimum time, by imposing some lower bound on the
information matrix. The problem is formulated as a time domain optimization
problem, which is non-convex. This is addressed through an alternating method,
where we separate the problem into two steps and at each step we optimize the
cost function with respect to one of two variables. We alternate between these
two steps until convergence. A time recursive input design algorithm is
performed, which enables us to use the algorithm with control. Therefore, a
receding horizon framework is used to solve each optimization problem. Finally,
we illustrate the method with two numerical examples which show the good

the problem of measurement reconstruction. We introduce shifted measurements

amorphous carbon films preclude any efficiency in dispersing charge. Graphene
addresses the limitations of amorphous carbon. Graphene is a crystalline
material with virtually no phase or amplitude contrast and unparalleled, high
electrical carrier mobility. However, the hydrophobic properties of graphene
have prevented its routine application in Cryo-TEM. This letter reports a
method for rendering graphene TEM supports hydrophilic - a convenient approach
maintaining graphene's structural and electrical properties based on

  Efficiency and Fairness",,,,,"cs.NI cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Driven by green communications, energy efficiency (EE) has become a new
important criterion for designing wireless communication systems. However, high
EE often leads to low spectral efficiency (SE), which spurs the research on
EE-SE tradeoff. In this paper, we focus on how to maximize the utility in
physical layer for an uplink multi-user multiple-input multipleoutput (MU-MIMO)
system, where we will not only consider EE-SE tradeoff in a unified way, but
also ensure user fairness. We first formulate the utility maximization problem,
but it turns out to be non-convex. By exploiting the structure of this problem,
we find a convexization procedure to convert the original nonconvex problem
into an equivalent convex problem, which has the same global optimum with the
original problem. Following the convexization procedure, we present a
centralized algorithm to solve the utility maximization problem, but it
requires the global information of all users. Thus we propose a primal-dual
distributed algorithm which does not need global information and just consumes
a small amount of overhead. Furthermore, we have proved that the distributed
algorithm can converge to the global optimum. Finally, the numerical results
show that our approach can both capture user diversity for EE-SE tradeoff and
ensure user fairness, and they also validate the effectiveness of our
primal-dual distributed algorithm.

developed for semiclassical computations for strongly-driven multi-center

strong-field phenomena in a transparent way. This allows us to identify the
shortcomings of currently used initial phase space distributions for the

for time-propagation that fully accounts for the Coulomb singularity. This

representation for the quantization of the field are fixed indeed in a unique

predictions) if we adopt the combined criterion of (a) imposing the invariance
of the vacuum under the group of spatial symmetries of the field equations and
(b) requiring a unitary implementation of the dynamics in the quantum theory.
Besides, we provide a spacetime interpretation of the field equations as those
corresponding to a scalar field in a cosmological spacetime that is conformally
ultrastatic. In addition, in the privileged Fock quantization, we investigate
the generalization of the evolution of physical states from the hyperbolic
dynamical regime to an elliptic regime. In order to do this, we contemplate the
possibility of processes with signature change in the spacetime where the field
propagates and discuss the behavior of the background geometry when the change
happens, proving that the spacetime metric degenerates. Finally, we argue that
this kind of signature change leads naturally to a phenomenon of particle
creation, with exponential production.

states in samples with simple geometries, such as a cylinder or a ribbon, have
been classified and understood during the last decade. Here, we extend these
studies to a M\""obius band, and argue that its lack of orientability prevents a
smooth global definition of parity-odd quantities such as pseudovectors. In
particular, the Chern number, the topological invariant for the quantum Hall
effect, lies in this class. The definition of spin on the M\""obius band
translates into the idea of the orientable double cover, an analogy used to
explain the possibility of having the quantum spin Hall effect on the M\""obius
band. We also provide symmetry arguments to show the possible lattice
structures and Hamiltonian terms for which topological states may exist in a
M\""obius band, and we locate our systems in the classification of topological
states. Then, we propose a method to calculate M\""obius dispersions from those
of the cylinder, and we show the results for a honeycomb and a kagome M\""obius
band with different types of edge termination. Although the quantum spin Hall
effect may occur in these systems when intrinsic spin-orbit coupling is
present, the quantum Hall effect is more intricate and requires the presence of
a domain wall in the sample. We propose an experimental set-up which could
allow for the realization of the elusive quantum Hall effect in a M\""obius
band.

temperatures. Those environments are thought to be very turbulent due to
dynamic phenomena such as outflows and high supernova rates. We investigate the
effect of mechanical heating (MH) on atomic fine-structure and molecular lines,
and their ratios. We use those ratios as a diagnostic to constrain the amount
of MH in an object and also study its significance on estimating the H2 mass.
Equilibrium PDRs models were used to compute the thermal and chemical balance
for the clouds. The equilibria were solved for numerically using the optimized
version of the Leiden PDR-XDR code. Large velocity gradient calculations were
done as post-processing on the output of the PDR models using RADEX. High-J CO
line ratios are very sensitive to MH. Emission becomes at least one order of
magnitude brighter in clouds with n~10^5~cm^-3 and a star formation rate of 1
Solar Mass per year (corresponding to a MH rate of 2 * 10^-19 erg cm^-3 s^-1).
Emission of low-J CO lines is not as sensitive to MH, but they do become
brighter in response to MH. Generally, for all of the lines we considered, MH
increases excitation temperatures and decreases the optical depth at the line
centre. Hence line ratios are also affected, strongly in some cases. Ratios
involving HCN are a good diagnostic for MH, such as HCN(1-0)/CO(1-0) and
HCN(1-0)/HCO^+(1-0). Both ratios increase by a factor 3 or more for a MH
equivalent to > 5 percent of the surface heating, as opposed to pure PDRs. The
first major conclusion is that low-J to high-J intensity ratios will yield a
good estimate of the MH rate (as opposed to only low-J ratios). The second one
is that the MH rate should be taken into account when determining A_V or
equivalently N_H, and consequently the cloud mass. Ignoring MH will also lead
to large errors in density and radiation field estimates.

optical modulation of more than 80% and time response faster than 100 ns in the
green-laser-driven fluorescence signal, which we control through an independent
near-infrared (NIR) gating laser. Our study indicates that the NIR laser
triggers a fast-decay channel of the NV mediated by promotion of the excited

microlensing parallax signal and do not have high angular resolution images
that could detect the planetary host star. Therefore, we do not have a direct
measurement of the host star mass. A Bayesian analysis, assuming that all host
stars have equal probability to host a planet with the measured mass ratio
implies a host star mass of M_h = 0.37_{-0.17}^{+0.30} M_Sun and a companion of
mass M_P = 4.6^{+3.7}_{-2.2} M_Jup, at a projected separation of r_proj =

6.8 +/- 1.1 kpc. A planetary system with the properties preferred by the
Bayesian analysis would be a challenge to the core-accretion model of planet
formation, as the core-accretion model predicts that massive planets are far
more likely to form around more massive host stars. This core accretion model
prediction is not consistent with our Bayesian prior of an equal probability of
host stars of all masses to host a planet with the measured mass ratio. So, if
the core accretion model prediction is right, we should expect that follow-up
high angular resolution observations will detect a host star with a mass in the
upper part of the range allowed by the Bayesian analysis. That is, the host
would probably be a K or G dwarf.

of Maleki et al. about {\it Retrospective Interference Alignment (RIA)} to be
applied to the MIMO IC, where transmitters and receivers are equipped with
$(M,N)$ antennas, respectively. We propose a two-phase transmission scheme
where the number of slots per phase and number of transmitted symbols are
optimized by solving a maximization problem. Finally, we review the existing
achievable DoF results in the literature as a function of the ratio between
transmitting and receiving antennas $\rho=M/N$. The proposed scheme improves
all other strategies when $\rho \in \left(\frac{1}{2}, \frac{31}{32} \right]$.

elementary functions such as exp, ln, sin, cos, etc. EHSs are very common in
practice, especially in safety-critical domains. Due to the non-polynomial
expressions which lead to undecidable arithmetic, verification of EHSs is very
hard. Existing approaches based on partition of state space or
over-approximation of reachable sets suffer from state explosion or inflation
of numerical errors. In this paper, we propose a symbolic abstraction approach
that reduces EHSs to polynomial hybrid systems (PHSs), by replacing all
non-polynomial terms with newly introduced variables. Thus the verification of
EHSs is reduced to the one of PHSs, enabling us to apply all the
well-established verification techniques and tools for PHSs to EHSs. In this
way, it is possible to avoid the limitations of many existing methods. We
illustrate the abstraction approach and its application in safety verification
of EHSs by several real world examples.

dimensional components of the high-dimensional parameter. Under bounds on the
$\ell_1$-norm on the worst possible sub-direction these rates are of order
$\sqrt {|J| \log p / n }$ where $p$ is the total number of parameters, $J
\subset \{ 1, \ldots, p \}$ represents a subset of the parameters and $n$ is
the number of observations. We also derive rates in sup-norm in terms of the
rate of convergence in $\ell_1$-norm. The irrepresentable condition on a set
$J$ requires that the $\ell_1$-norm of the worst possible sub-direction is
sufficiently smaller than one. In that case sharp oracle results can be
obtained. Moreover, if the coefficients in $J$ are small enough the Lasso will
put these coefficients to zero. This extends known results which say that the
irrepresentable condition on the inactive set (the set where coefficients are
exactly zero) implies no false positives. We further show that by
de-sparsifying one obtains fast rates in supremum norm without conditions on
the worst possible sub-direction. The main assumption here is that approximate
sparsity is of order $o (\sqrt n / \log p )$. The results are extended to
M-estimation with $\ell_1$-penalty for generalized linear models and
exponential families for example. For the graphical Lasso this leads to an
extension of known results to the case where the precision matrix is only
approximately sparse. The bounds we provide are non-asymptotic but we also
present asymptotic formulations for ease of interpretation.

model is called the $\Lambda$CDM+$r$+$\nu_s$ model in this paper. Compared to
the $\Lambda$CDM+$r$ model, there are two extra parameters, $N_{\rm eff}$ and
$m_{\nu,{\rm sterile}}^{\rm eff}$, in the $\Lambda$CDM+$r$+$\nu_s$ model. We
show that in this model the tension between Planck and BICEP2 can be greatly
relieved at the cost of the increase of $n_s$. However, comparing with the
$\Lambda$CDM+$r$+$dn_s/d\ln k$ model that can significantly reduce the tension
between Planck and BICEP2 but also makes trouble to inflation due to the large
running of the spectral index of order $10^{-2}$ produced, the
$\Lambda$CDM+$r$+$\nu_s$ model is much better for inflation. By including a
sterile neutrino species in the standard cosmology, besides the tension with
BICEP2, the other tensions of Planck with other astrophysical data, such as the
$H_0$ direct measurement, the Sunyaev-Zeldovich cluster counts, and the galaxy
shear data, can all be significantly relieved. So, this model seems to be an
economical choice. Combining the Planck temperature data, the WMAP-9
polarization data, and the baryon acoustic oscillation data with all these
astrophysical data (including BICEP2), we find that in the
$\Lambda$CDM+$r$+$\nu_s$ model $n_s=0.999\pm 0.011$, $r=0.21^{+0.04}_{-0.05}$,
$N_{\rm eff}=3.95\pm 0.33$ and $m_{\nu,{\rm sterile}}^{\rm

N)^{-1/25t}$, there exists a solution $x \in A^t$ to $V x = 0$ with distinct
coordinates. This extends a quantitative result of Helfgott and de Roton for

hold for all systems of equations of finite complexity by the work of Green and

$v_{2}^{n}$-$v_{2}^{p}$ and ratio $v_{2}^{n}$/$v_{2}^{p}$ of neutrons versus

very different density dependences of the symmetry energy, a moderately soft to

operators with large magnetic fields and Neumann realization in smooth
three-dimensional domains is characterized by model problems inside the domain

problems on sectors has to be taken into account. In this paper, we consider
the class of general corner domains. In dimension 3, they include as particular
cases polyhedra and axisymmetric cones. We attach model problems not only to
each point of the closure of the domain, but also to a hierarchy of ""tangent
substructures"" associated with singular chains. We investigate properties of
these model problems, namely continuity, semi-continuity, existence of
generalized eigenfunctions satisfying exponential decay. We prove estimates for
the remainders of our asymptotic formula. Lower bounds are obtained with the
help of an IMS partition based on adequate two-scale coverings of the corner
domain, whereas upper bounds are established by a novel construction of
quasimodes, qualified as sitting or sliding according to spectral properties of
local model problems. A part of our analysis extends to any dimension.

referred to as acoustic glitches since they create a characteristic periodic
signature in the frequencies of p modes. Here we examine the localized
disturbance arising from the helium second ionization zone in red giant branch
and clump stars. More specifically, we determine how accurately and precisely
the parameters of the ionization zone can be obtained from the oscillation
frequencies of stellar models. We use models produced by three different
generation codes that not only cover a wide range of stages of evolution along
the red giant phase but also incorporate different initial helium abundances.
We discuss the conditions under which such fits robustly and accurately
determine the acoustic radius of the second ionization zone of helium. The
determined radii of the ionization zones as inferred from the mode frequencies
were found to be coincident with the local maximum in the first adiabatic
exponent described by the models, which is associated with the outer edge of
the second ionization zone of helium. Finally, we consider whether this method
can be used to distinguish stars with different helium abundances. Although a
definite trend in the amplitude of the signal is observed any distinction would
be difficult unless the stars come from populations with vastly different
helium abundances or the uncertainties associated with the fitted parameters
can be reduced. However, application of our methodology could be useful for
distinguishing between different populations of red giant stars in globular
clusters, where distinct populations with very different helium abundances have
been observed.

solar-type stars, thereby providing a way to probe the stars using
asteroseismology. We provide the mode linewidths and mode heights of the
oscillations of various stars as a function of frequency and of effective
temperature. We used a time series of nearly two years of data for each star.
The 23 stars observed belong to the simple or F-like category. The power
spectra of the 23 main-sequence stars were analysed using both maximum
likelihood estimators and Bayesian estimators, providing individual mode
characteristics such as frequencies, linewidths, and mode heights. We study the
source of systematic errors in the mode linewidths and mode heights, and we
present a way to correct these errors with respect to a common reference fit.
Using the correction, we could explain all sources of systematic errors, which
could be reduced to less than $\pm$15% for mode linewidths and heights, and
less than $\pm$5% for amplitude, when compared to the reference fit. The effect
of a different estimated stellar background and a different estimated splitting
will provide frequency-dependent systematic errors that might affect the
comparison with theoretical mode linewidth and mode height, therefore affecting
the understanding of the physical nature of these parameters. All other sources
of relative systematic errors are less dependent upon frequency. We also
provide the dependence of the so-called linewidth dip, in the middle of the
observed frequency range, as a function of effective temperature. We show that
the depth of the dip decreases with increasing effective temperature. The
dependence of the dip on effective temperature may imply that the mixing length
parameter $\alpha$ or the convective flux may increase with effective
temperature.

extends and complements the X-ray survey of the central Carina nebula regions
performed in the Chandra Carina Complex Project. Using deep near-infrared
images from our recent VISTA survey of the Carina nebula complex, our Spitzer
point-source catalog, and optical archive data, we identify counterparts for
75% of these X-ray sources. Their spatial distribution shows two major
concentrations, the central cluster NGC 3324 and a partly embedded cluster in
the southern rim of the HII region, but majority of X-ray sources constitute a
rather homogeneously distributed population of young stars. Our color-magnitude
diagram analysis suggests ages of ~1-2 Myr for the two clusters, whereas the
distributed population shows a wider age range up to ~10 Myr. We also identify
previously unknown companions to two of the three O-type members of NGC 3324
and detect diffuse X-ray emission in the region. Our results suggests that the
observed region contains about 4000 young stars in total. The distributed
population is probably part of the widely distributed population of ~ 1-10 Myr
old stars, that was identified in the CCCP area. This implies that the global
stellar configuration of the Carina nebula complex is a very extended stellar
association, in which the (optically prominent) clusters contain only a
minority of the stellar population.

measure a dispersion-like signal, which is well suited to stabilizing the laser
to the transition. We have fully characterized the parameters for the
measurement and find that it is possible to measure the transition frequency to
better than 100kHz with an interrogation time of 30s. The long-term stability
of the spectroscopy signal is determined by employing two independent ion trap
systems. The first ion trap is used to stabilize the spectroscopy laser. The
second ion trap is then employed to measure the stability by continuously
probing the transition at two frequencies. From the Allan variance a frequency
instability of better than 10$^{-10}$ is obtained for an interrogation time of
1000s.

The goal is to give a language to the student in which to speak about quantum
physics in more detail, and to start the student on a path of fluency in this
language. On our journey we approach questions such as: -- You already know how
to calculate the energy eigenstates of a single particle in a simple
one-dimensional potential. How can such calculations be generalized to
non-trivial potentials, higher dimensions, and interacting particles? -- You
have heard that quantum mechanics describes our everyday world just as well as
classical mechanics does, but have you ever seen an example where such behavior
is calculated in detail and where the transition from classical to quantum
physics is evident? -- How can we describe the internal spin structure of
particles? How does this internal structure couple to the particles' motion? --
What are qubits and quantum circuits, and how can they be assembled to simulate
a future quantum computer?

independent regression problems, for which closed-form expression as well as
efficient iterative solvers are available. This makes it orders of magnitude
faster than conventional maximum likelihood learning for CRFs that require

the task of semantic image segmentation, showing that it is highly efficient,

the training of image segmentation models from significantly larger training
sets than had been used previously. We demonstrate this on two new datasets
that form a second contribution of this paper. They consist of over 180,000
images with figure-ground segmentation annotations. Our large-scale experiments
show that the possibilities of CRF-based image segmentation are far from

one can estimate the weight of any cut in the graph within factor $1+\epsilon$.
We present lower and upper bounds on the size of a randomized sketch, focusing
on the dependence on the accuracy parameter $\epsilon>0$.
  First, we prove that for every $\epsilon > 1/\sqrt n$, every sketch that
succeeds (with constant probability) in estimating the weight of all cuts
$(S,\bar S)$ in an $n$-vertex graph (simultaneously), must be of size
$\Omega(n/\epsilon^2)$ bits. In the special case where the sketch is itself a
weighted graph (which may or may not be a subgraph) and the estimator is the
sum of edge weights across the cut in the sketch, i.e., a cut sparsifier, we
show the sketch must have $\Omega(n/\epsilon^2)$ edges, which is optimal.
Despite the long sequence of work on graph sparsification, no such lower bound
was known on the size of a cut sparsifier.
  We then design a randomized sketch that, given $\epsilon\in(0,1)$ and an
edge-weighted $n$-vertex graph, produces a sketch of size $\tilde
O(n/\epsilon)$ bits, from which the weight of any cut $(S,\bar S)$ can be
reported, with high probability, within factor $1+\epsilon$. The previous upper
bound is $\tilde O(n/\epsilon^2)$ bits, which follows by storing a cut
sparsifier (Bencz{\'u}r and Karger, 1996). To obtain this improvement, we
critically use both that the sketch need only be correct on each fixed cut with
high probability (rather than on all cuts), and that the estimation procedure
of the data structure can be arbitrary (rather than a weighted subgraph). We
also show a lower bound of $\Omega(n/\epsilon)$ bits for the space requirement
of any data structure achieving this guarantee.

induced spin-orbit interaction are investigated thoroughly. The spin-orbit
interaction consists of two terms: the first one preserves the spin symmetry in
rotating frame, while the second one breaks it. It is found that the both terms
are equally important: i)at scattering on the potential step which mimics a
long-range potential in the nanotubes; ii)at transport via nanotube quantum
dots. It is shown that an armchair nanotube with the first spin-orbit term

sojourn times exhibits a phenomenon of dynamical localization in the case where
diffusion is anomalous: The probability to find two independent walkers at the
same site, as given by the participation ratio, stays constant and high in a
broad domain of intermediate times. This phenomenon is absent in dimensions two
and higher. In finite lattices of all dimensions the participation ratio
finally equilibrates to a different final value. We numerically investigate
two-particle properties in a random trap model in one and in three dimensions,
using a method based on spectral decomposition of the transition rate matrix.
The method delivers a very effective computational scheme producing numerically
exact results for the averages over thermal histories and initial conditions in
a given landscape realization. Only a single averaging procedure over disorder
realizations is necessary. The behavior of the participation ratio is compared
to other measures of localization, as for example to the states' gyration
radius, according to which the dynamically localized states are extended. This
means that although the particles are found at the same site with a high
probability, the typical distance between them grows. Moreover the final
equilibrium state is extended both with respect to its gyration radius and to
its Lyapunov exponent. In addition, we show that the phenomenon of dynamical
localization is only marginally connected with the spectrum of the transition
rate matrix, and is dominated by the properties of its eigenfunctions which
differ significantly in dimensions one and three.

Variable germinability arises during seed development under the influence of

shown to be regulated by independent asynchronous or dependent synchronous
action of seed structures. To gain better insight into the process, germination
was divided into axis specific embryo growth categories or states. Three states
were defined for each embryonic axis. The degree of embryo growth (germination
state) after eight to twelve days under germination conditions is believed to
reveal the germinability state (potential for germination) possessed by the
seed before germination. The embryo axes behave independently, which allows any
combination of germination states to occur. In general, the greater the
difference in germination between the axes, the less likely the combination of
states will occur. Photographic evidence of each germination state is shown for

during the process of the star formation, paying particular attention to the
phase space distribution of the DM particles after the contraction. Assuming
the initial uniform density and Maxwellian distribution of DM velocities, we
find that the number $n(r)$ of DM particles within the radius $r$ scales like
$n(r) \propto r^{1.5}$, leading to the DM density profile $\rho\propto
r^{-1.5}$, in agreement with the Liouville theorem and previous numerical
studies. At the same time, the number of DM particles $\nu(r)$ with periastra
smaller than $r$ is parametrically larger, $\nu(r) \propto r$, implying that
many particles contributing at any given moment into the density $\rho(r)$ at
small $r$ have very elongated orbits and spend most of their time at distances
larger than $r$. This has implications for the capture of DM by stars in the
process of their formation. As a concrete example we consider the case of
primordial black holes (PBH). We show that accounting for very eccentric orbits
boosts the amount of captured PBH by a factor of up to $2\times 10^3$ depending
on the PBH mass, improving correspondingly the previously derived constraints
on the PBH abundance.

resonance frequency shift, of the oscillator due to the magnetic torque on the

with published experimental data. The theoretical model presented here allows
to take full advantage of TDM as an efficient magnetometry method.

$F(x,r,p,X)=(F_1(x,r,p,X),\ldots,F_m(x,r,p,X))$, where $x$ belongs to a domain
$\Omega$, $r=u(x)\in\mathbb{R}^m$, $p=Du(x)$ and $X=D^2u(x)$, that can be
arranged into two categories that are mutually competitive but internally
cooperative. More precisely, for all $i\neq j$ in the set $\{1,2,\ldots,m\}$,
$F_j$ is monotone non-decreasing (non-increasing) in $r_i$ if and only if $F_i$
is monotone non-decreasing (non-increasing) in $r_j$ and $F_j$ is a monotone
function in $r_i$. We prove the existence and uniqueness of viscosity solutions

monotone increasing in $r_j$, at an at least linear rate. This should be
compared to the quasi-monotone systems studied by Ishii and Koike, where they
assume that $F(x,r,p,X)\ge F(x,s,p,X)$ if $r\le s$.

set of a Matroid are revealed on-line one by one, each together with its value.
An algorithm for the MSP is \textit{Matroid-Unknown} if, at every stage of its
execution: (i) it only knows the elements that have been revealed so far and
their values, and (ii) it has access to an oracle for testing whether or not
any subset of the elements that have been revealed so far is an independent
set. An algorithm is \textit{Known-Cardinality} if, in addition to (i) and
(ii), it also initially knows the cardinality of the ground set of the Matroid.
We present here a Known-Cardinality and \textit{Order-Oblivious} algorithm
that, with constant probability, selects an independent set of elements, whose
value is at least the optimal value divided by $O(\log{\log{\rho}})$, where
$\rho$ is the rank of the Matroid; that is, the algorithm has a
\textit{competitive-ratio} of $O(\log{\log{\rho}})$. The best previous results
for a Known-Cardinality algorithm are a competitive-ratio of $O(\log{\rho})$,
by Babaioff \textit{et al.} (2007), and a competitive-ratio of
$O(\sqrt{\log{\rho}})$, by Chakraborty and Lachish (2012). In many non-trivial
cases the algorithm we present has a competitive-ratio that is better than the
$O(\log{\log{\rho}})$. The cases in which it fails to do so are easily
characterized. Understanding these cases may lead to improved algorithms for
the problem or, conversely, to non-trivial lower bounds.

tracelessness constraints of higher spin gauge fields. The equation also occurs
in the theory of continuous spin representations of the Poincar\'e group.
Expressed in an oscillator basis for the higher spin fields, the equation
becomes a non-linear partial differential operator of the Riccati type acting
on the vertex functions. The consequences of the equation for the cubic vertex
is investigated in the light-front formulation of higher spin theory. The
classical vertex is completely fixed but there is room for off-shell quantum
corrections.

height estimate was about 3 m based on analysis of statistical data including
Chile earthquake in 1960. The NPP project industrial site height was 10 m. The
further deterministic estimates TPCO-JSCE confirmed the impossibility of the
industrial site flooding by a tsunami and therefore confirmed ecological safety
of the NPP. However, as a result of beyond design earthquake of 11 March 2011
the tsunami height at the shore near the Fukushima-Daiichi NPP reached 15 m.
This led to flooding and severe emergencies having catastrophic environmental
consequences. This paper proposes hydrodynamic model of tsunami emerging and
traveling based on conservative assumptions. The possibility of a tsunami wave
reaching 15 m height at the Fukushima-Daiichi NPP shore was confirmed for
deduced hydrodynamic resistance coefficient of 1.8. According to the model
developed a possibility of flooding is determined not only by the industrial
site height, magnitude and distance to the earthquake epicenter, but also by
duration of seismic impacts, power dissipation conditions, epicenter size and
other conditions.
