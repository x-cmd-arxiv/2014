noble-gas solids (helium and heavier elements), group-IV materials (diamond and

ice). Structural, vibrational, and thermodynamic properties of these materials
are discussed. Applications also include point defects in solids (structure and
diffusion), as well as nuclear quantum effects in solid surfaces and
adsorbates. Different phenomena are discussed, as solid-to-solid and
orientational phase transitions, rates of quantum processes,
classical-to-quantum crossover, and various finite-temperature anharmonic
effects (thermal expansion, isotopic effects, electron-phonon interactions).
Nuclear quantum effects are most remarkable in the presence of light atoms, so
that especial emphasis is laid on solids containing hydrogen as a constituent

instabilities at the high-mode (H-mode) pedestal are investigated in this paper
with the inclusion of bootstrap current for equilibrium and rotation effects
for stability, where $n$ is the toroidal mode number. The AEGIS (Adaptive
EiGenfunction Independent Solutions) code [L. J. Zheng, M. T. Kotschenreuther,
J. Comp. Phys. {\bf 211}, (2006)] is extended to include the diamagnetic drift
effects. This can be viewed as the lowest order approximation of the finite
Larmor radius effects in consideration of the pressure gradient steepness at
the pedestal. The H-mode discharges at Jointed European Torus (JET) is
reconstructed numerically using the VMEC code [P. Hirshman and J. C. Whitson,
Phys. Fluids {\bf 26}, 3553 (1983)], with bootstrap current taken into account.
Generally speaking, the diamagnetic drift effects are stabilizing. Our results
show that the effectiveness of diamagnetic stabilization depends sensitively on
the safe factor value ($q_s$) at the safety-factor reversal or plateau region.
The diamagnetic stabilization are weaker, when $q_s$ is larger than an integer;
while stronger, when $q_s$ is smaller or less larger than an integer. We also
find that the diamagnetic drift effects also depend sensitively on the rotation
direction. The diamagnetic stabilization in the co-rotation case is stronger
than in the counter rotation case with respect to the ion diamagnetic drift
direction.

observed properties of near contact binaries (NCBs). Those with a more massive
component filling the Roche lobe are SD1 binaries whereas in SD2 binaries the
Roche lobe filling component is less massive. Our evolutionary model assumes
that, following the Roche lobe overflow by the more massive component (donor),
mass transfer occurs until mass ratio reversal. A binary in an initial phase of
mass transfer, before mass equalization, is identified with SD1 binary. We show
that the transferred mass forms an equatorial bulge around the less massive
component (accretor). Its presence slows down the mass transfer rate to the
value determined by the thermal time scale of the accretor, once the bulge
sticks out above the Roche lobe. It means, that in a binary with a (typical)
mass ratio of 0.5 the SD1 phase lasts at least 10 times longer than resulting
from the standard evolutionary computations neglecting this effect. This is why
we observe so many SD1 binaries. Our explanation is in contradiction to
predictions identifying the SD1 phase with a broken contact phase of the
Thermal Relaxation Oscillations model. The continued mass transfer, past mass
equalization, results in mass ratio reversed. SD2 binaries are identified with
this phase. Our model predicts that the time scales of SD1 and SD2 phases are
comparable to one another. Analysis of the observations of 22 SD1 binaries, 27
SD2 binaries and 110 contact binaries (CBs) shows that relative number of both
types of NCBs favors similar time scales of both phases of mass transfer. Total
masses, orbital angular momenta and orbital periods of SD1 and SD2 binaries are
indistinguishable from each other whereas they differ substantially from the
corresponding parameters of CBs. We conclude that the results of the analysis
fully support the model presented in this paper.

binaries, in disagreement with the standard thin disk theory, is a
long-standing riddle for theoretical astronomers. We have tried to resolve this
question by studying the thermal stability of a thin disk with magnetically
driven winds in the $\dot{M}- \Sigma$ plane. It is found that disk winds can
greatly decrease the disk temperature and thus help the disk become more stable
at a given accretion rate. The critical accretion rate $\dot{M}_{\rm crit}$
corresponding to the thermal instability threshold is increased significantly
in the presence of disk winds. For $\alpha=0.01$ and $B_{\rm \phi}=10B_{\rm
_p}$, the disk is quite stable even for a very weak initial poloidal magnetic
field [$\beta_{\rm p,0}\sim 2000, \beta_{\rm p}=(P_{\rm {gas}}+P_{\rm
rad})/(B_{\rm p}^2/8\pi)$]. But when $B_{\rm \phi}=B_{\rm _p}$ or $B_{\rm
\phi}=0.1B_{\rm _p}$, a somewhat stronger (but still weak) field ($\beta_{\rm
p,0}\sim 200$ or $\beta_{\rm p,0}\sim 20$) is required to make the disk stable.
Nevertheless, despite the great increase of $\dot{M}_{\rm crit}$, the
luminosity threshold corresponding to instability remains almost constant or
even decreases slowly with increasing $\dot{M}_{\rm crit}$ due to the decrease
of gas temperature. The advection and diffusion timescales of the large-scale
magnetic field threading the disk are also investigated in this work. We find
that the advection timescale can be smaller than the diffusion timescale in a
disk with winds, because the disk winds take away most of the gravitational
energy released in the disk, resulting in the decrease of the magnetic
diffusivity $\eta$ and the increase of the diffusion timescale.

from a perpendicular cascade of \Alfvenic fluctuations and a local,

temperature anisotropy instabilities. By constraining the model's free
parameters through comparison to \emph{in situ} data, it is found that, on
average, $ \sim 95\%$ of the power near dissipative scales is contained in a

allow the state of the system to be inconsistent during execution, as long as
this inconsistency is bounded and does not affect transaction correctness. In
contrast to previous work, our approach uses program analysis to extract

automated. We then employ a novel homeostasis protocol to allow sites to

follows the standard evolution of a black hole outburst. During the rising
phase of the outburst we detect an abrupt change in timing behavior associated
with the occurrence of a type-B quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO). This QPO and
the simultaneously detected radio emission mark the transition between hard and
soft intermediate state. We fit power spectra from the rising phase of the
outburst using the recently proposed model propfluc. This assumes a truncated
disc / hot inner flow geometry, with mass accretion rate fluctuations
propagating through a precessing inner flow. We link the propfluc physical
parameters to the phenomenological multi-Lorentzian fit parameters. The
physical parameter dominating the QPO frequency is the truncation radius, while
broad band noise characteristics are also influenced by the radial surface
density and emissivity profiles of the flow. In the outburst rise we found that
the truncation radius decreases from $r_o \sim 24$ to $10 R_g$, and the surface
density increases faster than the mass accretion rate, as previously reported
for XTE J1550-564. Two soft intermediate state observations could not be fitted
with propfluc, and we suggest that they are coincident with the ejection of
material from the inner regions of the flow in a jet or accretion of these
regions into the BH horizon, explaining the drop in QPO frequency and
suppression of broad band variability preferentially at high energy bands
coincident with a radio flare.

are a popular class of graphical models. However, learning Bayesian networks
from discrete or categorical data is particularly challenging, due to the large

conditional distribution of a node given its parents by multi-logit regression,
in which an edge is parameterized by a set of coefficient vectors with dummy
variables encoding the levels of a node. To obtain a sparse DAG, a group norm
penalty is employed, and a blockwise coordinate descent algorithm is developed
to maximize the penalized likelihood subject to the acyclicity constraint of a
DAG. When interventional data are available, our method constructs a causal
network, in which a directed edge represents a causal relation. We apply our
method to various simulated and real data sets. The results show that our
method is very competitive, compared to many existing methods, in DAG
estimation from both interventional and high-dimensional observational data.

component represented by a quintessence field. The Lagrangian for this system,
hereafter called the Friedmann--Robertson--Walker--quintessence (FRWq) system,
is presented. It is shown that the classical Lagrangian reproduces the usual
two (second order) dynamical equations for the radius of the Universe and for
the quintessence scalar field as well as a (first order) constraint equation.
  It is noted that the quintessence field (dark energy) is related with the
tlaplon field (appearing on dynamical theories of spacetime torsion). Our
approach naturally unifies gravity and dark energy, as it is obtained that the
Lagrangian and the equations of motion are those of a relativistic particle
moving on a two dimensional conformally flat spacetime, whereas the conformal
metric factor is related to the dark energy scalar field potential. We proceed
to quantize the system in three different schemes. First, we assume the
Universe as a spinless particle (as it is common in literature), obtaining a
quantum theory for a Universe described by the Klein--Gordon equation. Second,
we push the quantization scheme further assuming the Universe as a Dirac
particle, and therefore constructing its corresponding Dirac and the Majorana
theories. With the different theories we calculate the expected values for the
scale factor of the Universe. They depend on the type of quantization scheme
used. The differences between the Dirac and Majorana schemes are highlighted.
The implications of the different quantization procedures are discussed.
Finally the possible consequences for a multiverse theory of the Dirac and
Majorana quantized Universe are briefly considered.

Norma cluster galaxy ESO 137-001, out to a projected distance of 40 kpc from
the disk. ESO 137-001 has an 80 kpc long and bright X-ray tail associated with
a shorter (40 kpc) and broader tail of numerous star-forming H II regions. The
amount of about 1.5x10^8 Msun of H_2 found in the most distant region is
similar to molecular masses of tidal dwarf galaxies, though the standard
Galactic CO-to-H_2 factor could overestimate the H_2 content. Along the tail,
we find the amount of molecular gas to drop, while masses of the X-ray emitting
and diffuse ionized components stay roughly constant. Moreover, the amounts of
hot and cold gas are large and similar, and together nearly account for the
missing gas from the disk. We find a very low star formation efficiency (tau >
10^10 yr) in the stripped gas in ESO 137-001 and suggest that this is due to a
low average gas density in the tail, or turbulent heating of the interstellar
medium that is induced by a ram pressure shock. The unprecedented bulk of
observed H_2 in the ESO 137-001 tail suggests that some stripped gas may
survive ram pressure stripping in the molecular phase.

have been important sources of energy feedback into the interstellar and
intergalactic media, playing a major role in the reionization epoch. A
metallicity dependence of the production rate or luminosity of the sources is a
key ingredient generally assumed but not yet probed. Aims: Our goal is to
explore the relation between the X-ray luminosity (Lx) and star formation rate
of galaxies as a possible tracer of a metallicity dependence of the production
rates and/or X-ray luminosities of HMXBs. Methods: We developed a model to
estimate the Lx of star forming galaxies based on stellar evolution models
which include metallicity dependences. We applied our X-ray binary models to
galaxies selected from hydrodynamical cosmological simulations which include
chemical evolution of the stellar populations in a self-consistent way.
Results: Our models successfully reproduce the dispersion in the observed
relations as an outcome of the combined effects of the mixture of stellar
populations with heterogeneous chemical abundances and the metallicity
dependence of the X-ray sources. We find that the evolution of the Lx as a
function of SFR of galaxies could store information on possible metallicity
dependences of the HMXB sources. A non-metallicity dependent model predicts a
non-evolving relation while any metallicity dependence should affect the slope
and the dispersion as a function of redshift. Our results suggest the
characteristics of the Lx evolution can be linked to the nature of the
metallicity dependence of the production rate or the Lx of the stellar sources.
By confronting our models with current available observations of strong
star-forming galaxies, we find that only chemistry-dependent models reproduce
the observed trend for z < 4.

understand the chemistry of the formation and loss of ethylene oxide in hot and
cold interstellar objects (i) by including in a revised gas-grain network some
recent experimental results on grain surfaces and (ii) by comparison with the
chemical behaviour of its isomer, acetaldehyde. We test the code for the case
of a hot core. The model allows us to predict the gaseous and solid ethylene
oxide abundances during a cooling-down phase prior to star formation and during
the subsequent warm-up phase. We can therefore predict at what temperatures
ethylene oxide forms on grain surfaces and at what temperature it starts to
desorb into the gas phase. The model reproduces the observed gaseous abundances
of ethylene oxide and acetaldehyde towards high-mass star-forming regions. In
addition, our results show that ethylene oxide may be present in outer and
cooler regions of hot cores where its isomer has already been detected. Despite
their different chemical structures, the chemistry of ethylene oxide is coupled
to that of acetaldehyde, suggesting that acetaldehyde may be used as a tracer
for ethylene oxide towards cold cores.

the cluster magnetic field. In contrast to models in which the photon line
arises directly from dark matter decay or annihilation, this can explain the
anomalous line strength in the Perseus cluster. As axion-photon conversion
scales as $B^2$ and cool core clusters have high central magnetic fields, this
model can also explains the observed peaking of the line emission in the cool

larger dark matter halos. We describe distinctive predictions of this scenario

temperature, and for a certain temperature the phenomenon of entanglement
vanishes at the threshold temperature. For the Heisenberg coupled model or even
the Ising model with a transverse magnetic field, one can observe some rise of
entanglement even for a disentangled region at zero temperature. So we can
understand this emergence of entanglement at finite temperature as being due to
the mixing of some maximally entangled states with some other untangled states.
Here, we present a simple one-dimensional Ising model with alternating Ising
and Heisenberg spins in an arbitrarily oriented magnetic field, which can be
mapped onto the classical Ising model with a magnetic field. This model does
not show any evidence of entanglement at zero temperature, but surprisingly at
finite temperature rise a pairwise thermal entanglement between two untangled
spins at zero temperature, when an arbitrarily oriented magnetic field is
applied. This effect is a purely magnetic field,and the temperature dependence,
as soon as the temperature increases, causes a small increase in concurrence
achieving its maximum at around 0.1. Even for long-range entanglement, a weak
concurrence still survives. There are also some real materials that could serve
as candidates that would exhibit this effect, such as
Dy(NO$_{3}$)(DMSO)$_{2}$Cu(opba)(DMSO)$_{2}$.

candidates that had been previously reported in the literature which do not
pass our various tests. All 106 of our candidates have passed several standard
tests to rule out false positives due to eclipsing stellar systems. A low false
positive rate is also implied by the relatively high fraction of candidates for
which more than one transiting planet signal was detected. By assuming these
multi-transit candidates represent coplanar multi-planet systems, we are able
to infer that the USP planets are typically accompanied by other planets with
periods in the range 1-50 days, in contrast with hot Jupiters which very rarely
have companions in that same period range. Another clear pattern is that almost
all USP planets are smaller than 2 $R_\oplus$, possibly because gas giants in
very tight orbits would lose their atmospheres by photoevaporation when subject
to extremely strong stellar irradiation. Based on our survey statistics, USP
planets exist around approximately $(0.51\pm 0.07)\%$ of G-dwarf stars, and

new physics has to be discovered in the forthcoming years, the ultimate goal of
the high-energy physics program will consist of fully characterizing the
newly-discovered degrees of freedom in terms of properties such as their
masses, spins and couplings. The scope of this paper is to show how the
availability of polarized beams at high-energy proton-proton colliders could
yield a unique discriminating power between different beyond the Standard Model

distribution functions. We then demonstrate how polarized beams allow one not
only to disentangle different production mechanisms giving the same final-state
signature, but also to obtain information on the parameters of the hypothetical
new physics sector of the theory. This is illustrated in the case of a
particular class of scenarios leading to monotop production. We consider three
specific models that could produce a monotop signature in unpolarized proton

double-spin asymmetries in polarized collisions. Our results are presented for

insight into the structure and the composition of neutron stars. EXO 0748-676
had been actively accreting for over 24 yr before its outburst ceased in late
2008. Subsequent X-ray monitoring revealed a gradual decay of the quiescent
thermal emission that can be attributed to cooling of the accretion-heated
neutron star crust. In this work, we report on new Chandra and Swift
observations that extend the quiescent monitoring to ~5 yr post-outburst. We
find that the neutron star temperature remained at ~117 eV between 2009 and
2011, but had decreased to ~110 eV in 2013. This suggests that the crust has
not fully cooled yet, which is supported by the lower temperature of ~95 eV
that was measured ~4 yr prior to the accretion phase in 1980. Comparing the
data to thermal evolution simulations reveals that the apparent lack of cooling
between 2009 and 2011 could possibly be a signature of convection driven by
phase separation of light and heavy nuclei in the outer layers of the neutron

Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) in the presence of distortions. As one
application, we focus on CMB distortions due to gravitational lensing by Large
Scale Structure (LSS). We study the Hu-Okamoto quadratic estimator for
extracting lensing from the CMB and derive the noise of the estimator up to
${\mathcal O}(\phi^4)$ in the lensing potential $\phi$. The previously noted
large ${\mathcal O}(\phi^4)$ term can be significantly reduced by a
reorganization of the $\phi$ expansion. Our approach makes it simple to obtain
expressions for quadratic estimators based on any CMB channel. We briefly
discuss other applications to cosmology of this diagrammatic approach, such as
distortions of the CMB due to patchy reionization, or due to Faraday rotation
from primordial axion fields.

identified by the QUEST survey in the direction of the Virgo constellation.
Distributed over 90 sq. deg. of the sky, they lie from 4 to 23 kpc from the
Sun. Using an algorithm for finding groups in phase space and modeling the
smooth halo component in the region, we identified the 5 most significant RRLS
groups. We have examined the SEKBO and the Catalina catalog of RRLS (Prior et
al. 2009, and Drake et al. 2013), as well as the bright QUEST RRLS sample
(Vivas et al. in prep.), the catalogs of Blue Horizontal Branch stars compiled
by Sirko et al (2004) and Brown et al (2008, 2010) and the catalog of Red Giant
stars from the Spaghetti survey, for stars that may be related to the QUEST
RRLS groups. The most significant group of RRLS is the Virgo Stellar Stream
(VSS, Duffau et al 2006), group A, which is composed of at least 10 RRLS and 3
BHB stars. It has a mean distance of 19.6 kpc and a mean radial velocity Vgsr =
128 km/s, as estimated from its RRLS members. With the revised velocities
reported here, there is no longer an offset in velocity between the RRLS in the
VSS and the prominent peak in the velocities of main-sequence turnoff stars
reported by Newberg et al (2007) in the same direction and at a similar
distance (S297+63-20.5). The location in phase space of two other groups (F,H)
suggests a possible connection with the VSS, which cannot be discarded at this
point, although the turnoff colors of the VSS and group H, as identified from
Newberg et al. (2007), suggest they might be composed of different populations.
Two more groups (B,D), are found at mean distances of 19 and 5.7 kpc, and mean
radial velocities of -94 and 32 km/s. None of our groups seems to relate to Sgr
streams. The excess of stars observed in Virgo appears to be composed of
several halo substructures along the same line of sight.

planar alignments of satellite galaxies in the Millennium-II simulation, and
concluded that vast thin planes of dwarf galaxies, similar to that observed in
the Andromeda galaxy (M31), occur frequently by chance in $\Lambda$-Cold Dark
Matter cosmology. However, their analysis did not capture the essential fact
that the observed alignment is simultaneously radially extended, yet thin, and
kinematically unusual. With the caveat that the Millennium-II simulation may
not have sufficient mass resolution to identify confidently simulacra of
low-luminosity dwarf galaxies, we re-examine that simulation for planar
structures, using the same method as employed by Ibata et al. (2013) on the
real M31 satellites. We find that 0.04\% of host galaxies display satellite
alignments that are at least as extreme as the observations, when we consider
their extent, thickness and number of members rotating in the same sense. We
further investigate the angular momentum properties of the co-planar
satellites, and find that the median of the specific angular momentum derived
from the line of sight velocities in the real M31 structure ($1.3\times10^4$
km/s kpc) is very high compared to systems drawn from the simulations. This
analysis confirms that it is highly unlikely that the observed structure around
the Andromeda galaxy is due to a chance occurrence. Interestingly, the few
extreme systems that are similar to M31 arise from the accretion of a massive
sub-halo with its own spatially-concentrated entourage of orphan satellites.

luminosity functions are derived for different redshift and richness bins, and
the IRAC imaging reaches depths of m*+2, allowing us to measure the faint end
slopes of the luminosity functions. We find that {\alpha} = -1 describes the
luminosity function very well in all redshifts bins and does not evolve
significantly. This provides evidence that the rate at which the low mass
galaxy population grows through star formation, gets quenched and is
replenished by in-falling field galaxies does not have a major net effect on
the shape of the luminosity function. Our measurements for m* are consistent
with passive evolution models and high formation redshifts z_f ~ 3. We find a
slight trend towards fainter m* for the richest clusters, implying that the
most massive clusters in our sample could contain older stellar populations,
yet another example of cosmic downsizing. Modelling shows that a contribution
of a star-forming population of up to 40% cannot be ruled out. This value,
found from our targeted survey, is significantly lower than the values found
for slightly lower redshift, z ~ 1, clusters found in wide-field surveys. The
results are consistent with cosmic downsizing, as the clusters studied here
were all found in the vicinity of radio-loud AGNs -- which have proven to be
preferentially located in massive dark matter halos in the richest environments
at high redshift -- they may therefore be older and more evolved systems than
the general protocluster population.

with steep versus flat $\alpha$ generally have different polarization SEDs:
steep-spectrum sources exhibit depolarization, while flat-spectrum sources
maintain constant polarized fractions over large ranges in wavelength. This
suggests the run of polarized fraction with wavelength is predominantly
affected by the local source environment, rather than by unrelated foreground
magnetoionic material. In addition, a significant fraction (21%) of sources
exhibit ""repolarization"", which further suggests that polarized SEDs are
affected by different emitting regions within the source, rather than by a
particular depolarization law. This has implications for the physical
interpretation of future broadband polarimetric surveys.

implement Veneziano's Nf/Nc expansion to identify the density onset. We find
the baryon mass M_B and the pion mass m_pi appearing from different order of

for the Silver Blaze in the region of m_pi/2 < mu_q < M_B/Nc. We point out,
however, that Veneziano's expansion brings about a puzzling subtlety along the
same line as the baryon problem in finite-density quenched simulations. We
emphasize that the large-Nc limit can allow for the physical ordering of M_B
and m_pi thanks to the similarity to the quenched approximation, while the
unphysical ghost quarks contaminate the baryon sector if Nc is finite. We also
discuss the ``orientifold'' large-Nc limit that does not quench quark loops.

direction of cluster merger but is significantly less extended than the X-ray
emission in the perpendicular direction. At low significance we detect a faint
second peak in the radio halo close to the X-ray centroid of the smaller
sub-cluster (the bullet) suggesting that, similarly to the X-ray emission, the
radio halo may consist of two components. Finally, we find that the distinctive
shape of the western edge of the radio halo traces out the X-ray detected bow
shock. The radio halo morphology and the lack of strong point-to-point
correlations between radio, X-ray and weak-lensing properties suggests that the
radio halo is still being formed. The colocation of the X-ray shock with a
distinctive radio brightness edge illustrates that the shock is influencing the
structure of the radio halo. These observations support the theory that shocks

emission.

view the ground states of local Hamiltonians as potential resources for
universal quantum computation. A central goal in this field is to find models
with ground states that are universal for MBQC and that are also natural in the
sense that they involve only two-body interactions and have a small local
Hilbert space dimension. Graph states are the original resource states for
MBQC, and while it is not possible to obtain graph states as exact ground
states of two-body Hamiltonians here we construct two-body frustration-free
Hamiltonians that have arbitrarily good approximations of graph states as
unique ground states. The construction involves taking a two-body
frustration-free model that has a ground state convertible to a graph state
with stochastic local operations, then deforming the model such that its ground
state is close to a graph state. Each graph state qubit resides in a subspace
of a higher dimensional particle. This deformation can be applied to two-body
frustration-free Affleck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki (AKLT) models, yielding
Hamiltonians that are exactly solvable with exact tensor network expressions
for ground states. For the star-lattice AKLT model, the ground state of which
is not expected to be a universal resource for MBQC, applying such a
deformation appears to enhance the computational power of the ground state,
promoting it to a universal resource for MBQC. Transitions in computational
power, similar to percolation phase transitions, can be observed when
Hamiltonians are deformed in this way. Improving the fidelity of the ground
state comes at the cost of a shrinking gap. While analytically proving gap
properties for these types of models is difficult in general, we provide a
detailed analysis of the deformation of a spin-1 AKLT state to a linear graph

arXiv:0810.5645 are rational numbers which `count' both $\tau$-stable and
$\tau$-semistable coherent sheaves with Chern character $\alpha$ on a
Calabi-Yau 3-fold $X$, where $\tau$ denotes Gieseker stability for some ample
line bundle on $X$. These invariants are defined for all classes $\alpha$, and
are equal to the classical Donaldson-Thomas invariant defined by Thomas
arXiv:math/9806111 when it is defined. They are unchanged under deformations of
$X$, and transform by a wall-crossing formula under change of stability
condition $\tau$. Joyce and Song use gauge theory and transcendental complex
analytic methods, so that their theory of generalized Donaldson-Thomas
invariants is valid only in the complex case. This paper will propose a new
algebraic method extending the theory to algebraically closed fields K of
characteristic zero, and partly to triangulated categories and for non
necessarily compact Calabi-Yau 3-folds under some hypothesis.

For interoperability, these elements are represented by long strings. Such

for alleviating the impact of this problem is through the use of compression
methods that produce more compact representations of the data. The use of
dictionary encoding for this purpose is particularly prevalent in Semantic Web
database systems. However, centralized implementations present performance
bottlenecks, giving rise to the need for scalable, efficient distributed
encoding schemes. In this paper, we describe an encoding implementation based
on the asynchronous partitioned global address space (APGAS) parallel
programming model. We evaluate performance on a cluster of up to 384 cores and
datasets of up to 11 billion triples (1.9 TB). Compared to the state-of-art
MapReduce algorithm, we demonstrate a speedup of 2.6-7.4x and excellent
scalability. These results illustrate the strong potential of the APGAS model
for efficient implementation of dictionary encoding and contributes to the
engineering of larger scale Semantic Web applications.

describe the binding phenomena between two fermionic quasiparticles leading to
an $S=0$ and to an $S=1$ exciton. The latter corresponds to the lowest spin
excitation and defines the spin gap which remains finite through the transition
from BI to SDI. The former becomes soft at the transition indicating that the
SDI corresponds to a condensate of these $S=0$ excitons. This view is confirmed
by a BCS mean field theory for the SDI phase.

characterised by two distinct Cold Dark Matter (CDM) particle species with
opposite couplings to a Dark Energy scalar field - introduces a number of novel
features in the small-scale dynamics of cosmic structures, most noticeably the
simultaneous existence of both attractive and repulsive fifth-forces. Such
small-scale features are expected to imprint possibly observable footprints on
nonlinear cosmic structures, that might provide a direct way to test the
scenario. In order to unveil such footprints, we have performed the first suite
of high-resolution N-body simulations of McDE cosmologies, covering the
coupling range $|\beta |\leq 1$. We find that for coupling values corresponding
to fifth-forces weaker than standard gravity, the impact on structure formation
is very mild, thereby showing a new type of screening mechanism for long-range
scalar interactions. On the contrary, for fifth-forces comparable to or
stronger than standard gravity a number of effects appear in the statistical
and structural properties of CDM halos. Collapsed structures start to fragment
into pairs of smaller objects that move on different trajectories, providing a
direct evidence of the violation of the weak equivalence principle.
Consequently, the relative abundance of halos of different masses is
significantly modified. For sufficiently large coupling values, the expected
number of clusters is strongly suppressed, which might alleviate the present
tension between CMB- and cluster-based cosmological constraints. Finally, the
internal structure of halos is also modified, with a significant suppression of
the inner overdensity, and a progressive segregation of the two CDM species.

of galaxy formation based on the Millennium and Millennium-II simulations. SDSS
satellites behave differently around high- and low-mass primaries: those
orbiting objects with $M_*>10^{11}M_\odot$ are mostly red and are less
concentrated towards their host than the inferred dark matter halo, an effect
that is very pronounced for the few blue satellites. On the other hand, less
massive primaries have steeper satellite profiles that agree quite well with
the expected dark matter distribution and are dominated by blue satellites,
even in the inner regions where strong environmental effects are expected. In
fact, such effects appear to be strong only for primaries with $M_* >
10^{11}M_\odot$. This behaviour is not reproduced by current semi-analytic
simulations, where satellite profiles always parallel those of the dark matter
and satellite populations are predominantly red for primaries of all masses.
The disagreement with SDSS suggests that environmental effects are too
efficient in the models. Modifying the treatment of environmental and star
formation processes can substantially increase the fraction of blue satellites,
but their radial distribution remains significantly shallower than observed. It
seems that most satellites of low-mass primaries can continue to form stars
even after orbiting within their joint halo for 5 Gyr or more.

generalize this behavior defining a McMullen-like mapping as a rational map $f$

stellar object (YSO) with class II methanol maser emission, a YSO with a
massive outflow, and finally the NH_2D prestellar cores from Pillai et al. This
remarkable positioning reflects the (star) formation history of the region. We
find that it is unlikely that the star formation in the W 48A molecular cloud
was triggered by the UCHII region and discuss the Aquila supershell expansion
as a mayor influence on the evolution of W 48A. We conclude that the
combination of Herschel continuum data with interferometric molecular line and
radio continuum data is important to derive trustworthy age estimates and
interpret the origin of large scale structures through kinematic information.

Isospin structure of self-consistent p-n mixed solutions has been investigated
with and without the Coulomb interaction, which is the sole source of isospin
symmetry breaking in our approach. The extended axial HFBTHO solver has been
benchmarked against the symmetry-unrestricted HFODD code for deformed and
spherical states. We developed and tested a general isospin-invariant
Skyrme-EDF framework. The new approach permits spin-isospin densities that may
give rise to, hitherto, unexplored modes in the excitation spectrum. The new
formalism has been tested in the Hartree-Fock limit. A systematic comparison
between HFODD and HFBTHO results show a maximum deviation of about 10 keV on
the total binding energy for deformed nuclei when the Coulomb term is included.
Without this term, the results of both solvers agree down to a ~10 eV level.

kinematics intermediate between fast and slow rotators. We find that minor
mergers induce a lower decrease of the global rotational support than
encounters of lower mass ratios, which results in S0s with properties
intermediate between fast and slow rotators. The resulting remnants are
intrinsically more triaxial, less flattened, and span the whole range of
apparent ellipticities up to $\epsilon_\mathrm{e} \sim 0.8$. They do not show
lower apparent ellipticities in random projections than initially; on the
contrary, the formation of oval distortions and the disc thickening increase
the percentage of projections at $0.4 < \epsilon_\mathrm{e} < 0.7$. In the
experiments with S0b progenitor galaxies, minor mergers tend to spin up the
bulge and to decrease slightly its intrinsic ellipticity, whereas in the cases
of primary S0c galaxies they keep the rotational support of the bulge nearly
constant and decrease significantly its intrinsic ellipticity. The remnant
bulges remain nearly spherical ($B/A \sim C/A > 0.9$), but exhibit a wide range
of triaxialities ($0.20 < T < 1.00$). In the plane of global anisotropy of
velocities ($\delta$) vs. intrinsic ellipticity ($\epsilon_\mathrm{e,intr}$),
some of our models extend the linear trend found in previous major merger
simulations towards higher $\epsilon_\mathrm{e,intr}$ values, while others
depart from it. This is consistent with the wide dispersion exhibited by real
S0s in this diagram compared with ellipticals, which follow the linear trend
drawn by major merger simulations. The different trends exhibited by
ellipticals and S0 galaxies in the $\delta$ - $\epsilon_\mathrm{e}$ diagram may
be pointing to the different role played by major mergers in the build-up of

evaluated in the context of ESA's XMM-Newton observatory. Recent calculations
of the scattering of axion-conversion X-rays suggest that the sunward
magnetosphere could be an observable source of 0.2-10 keV photons. For
XMM-Newton, any conversion X-ray intensity will be seasonally modulated by
virtue of the changing visibility of the sunward magnetic field region. A
simple model of the geomagnetic field is combined with the ephemeris of
XMM-Newton to predict the seasonal variation of the conversion X-ray intensity.
This model is compared with stacked XMM-Newton blank sky datasets from which
point sources have been systematically removed. Remarkably, a seasonally
varying X-ray background signal is observed. The EPIC count rates are in the
ratio of their X-ray grasps, indicating a non-instrumental, external photon
origin, with significances of 11(pn), 4(MOS1) and 5(MOS2) sigma. After
examining the constituent observations spatially, temporally and in terms of
the cosmic X-ray background, we conclude that this variable signal is
consistent with the conversion of solar axions in the Earth's magnetic field.
The spectrum is consistent with a solar axion spectrum dominated by
bremsstrahlung- and Compton-like processes, i.e. axion-electron coupling
dominates over axion-photon coupling and the peak of the axion spectrum is
below 1 keV. A value of 2.2e-22 /GeV is derived for the product of the
axion-photon and axion-electron coupling constants, for an axion mass in the
micro-eV range. Comparisons with limits derived from white dwarf cooling may
not be applicable, as these refer to axions in the 0.01 eV range. Preliminary

inhomogeneities in cloud coverage and thickness are likely responsible for much
of the observed variability, it is possible that some of the variations arise
from atmospheric temperature fluctuations instead of, or in addition to,
clouds. To better understand the role that thermal variability might play we
present a case study of brown dwarf variability using a newly-developed
one-dimensional, time-stepping model of atmospheric thermal structure. We focus
on the effects of thermal perturbations, intentionally simplifying the problem
through omission of clouds and atmospheric circulation. Model results
demonstrate that thermal perturbations occurring deep in the atmosphere (at
pressures greater than 10 bar) of a model T-dwarf can be communicated to the
upper atmosphere through radiative heating via the windows in near-infrared
water opacity. The response time depends on where in the atmosphere a thermal
perturbation is introduced. We show that, for certain periodic perturbations,
the emission spectrum can have complex, time- and wavelength-dependent
behaviors, including phase shifts in times of maximum flux observed at
different wavelengths. Since different wavelengths probe different levels in
the atmosphere, these variations track a wavelength-dependent set of radiative
exchanges happening between different atmospheric levels as a perturbation
evolves in time. We conclude that thermal--as well as cloud--fluctuations must
be considered as possible contributors to the observed brown dwarf variability.

values, a heteroclinic orbit in the phase plane representing a smooth

the heteroclinic orbit was destroyed, or rather cut-off, by a wall of
singularities in the phase plane. As a result, they concluded that under this

geometric singular perturbation theory and canard theory, we show that a
travelling wave solution actually still exists for this parameter regime: we
construct a heteroclinic orbit passing through the wall of singularities via a
folded saddle canard point onto a repelling slow manifold. The orbit leaves
this manifold via the fast dynamics and lands on the attracting slow manifold,
finally connecting to its end state. This new travelling wave is no longer
smooth but exhibits a sharp front or shock. Finally, we identify regions in

two programmable measurements on an ancillary qubit, in place of the $O(d^2)$

finitely dependent stationary processes. A stochastic process is finitely
dependent if variables at sufficiently well-separated locations are
independent; it is a block-factor if it can be expressed as an equivariant
finite-range function of independent variables. The problem of finding
non-block-factor finitely dependent processes dates back to 1965. The first
published example appeared in 1993, and we provide arguably the first natural
examples. More precisely, Schramm proved in 2008 that no stationary 1-dependent
3-coloring of the integers exists, and conjectured that no stationary
k-dependent q-coloring exists for any k and q. We disprove this by constructing
a 1-dependent 4-coloring and a 2-dependent 3-coloring, thus resolving the
question for all k and q.
  Our construction is canonical and natural, yet very different from all
previous schemes. In its pure form it yields precisely the two finitely
dependent colorings mentioned above, and no others. The processes provide
unexpected connections between extremal cases of the Lovasz local lemma and
descent and peak sets of random permutations. Neither coloring can be expressed
as a block-factor, nor as a function of a finite-state Markov chain; indeed, no
stationary finitely dependent coloring can be so expressed. We deduce
extensions involving d dimensions and shifts of finite type; in fact, any
non-degenerate shift of finite type also distinguishes between block-factors
and finitely dependent processes.

our understanding on the massive star evolution in the final centuries toward
the SN explosion. In this paper, we report on detection and analyses of thermal
X-ray emission from SN IIb 2011dh at ~500 days after the explosion on Chandra
archival data, providing a solidly derived mass loss rate of an YSG progenitor
for the first time. We find that the circumstellar media (CSM) should be dense,
more than that expected from a Wolf-Rayet (WR) star by one order of magnitude.
The emission is powered by a reverse shock penetrating into an outer envelope,
fully consistent with the YSG progenitor but not with a WR progenitor. The
density distribution at the outermost ejecta is much steeper than that expected
from a compact WR star, and this finding must be taken into account in modeling
the early UV/optical emission from SNe IIb. The derived mass loss rate is 3 x
10^{-6} Msun/year for the mass loss velocity of ~20 km/s in the final ~1,300
years before the explosion. The derived mass loss properties are largely
consistent with the standard wind mass loss expected for a giant star. This is
not sufficient to be a main driver to expel nearly all the hydrogen envelope.
Therefore, the binary interaction, with a huge mass transfer having taken place
at >1,300 years before the explosion, is a likely scenario to produce the YSG
progenitor.

been reported and there is strong interest in wide-field, sensitive searches
for such events. To achieve high sensitivity, large collecting area is needed
and dispersion due to the interstellar medium should be removed. To survey a
large part of the sky in reasonable time, a telescope that forms multiple
simultaneous beams is desirable. We have developed a novel FPGA-based transient
search engine that is suitable for these circumstances. It accepts
short-integration-time spectral power measurements from each beam of the
telescope, performs incoherent de-dispersion simultaneously for each of a wide
range of dispersion measure (DM) values, and automatically searches the
de-dispersed time series for pulse-like events. If the telescope provides
buffering of the raw voltage samples of each beam, then our system can provide
trigger signals to allow data in those buffers to be saved when a tentative
detection occurs; this can be done with a latency of tens of ms, and only the
buffers for beams with detections need to be saved. In one version of our
implementation, intended for the ASKAP array of 36 antennas (currently under
construction in Australia), 36 beams are simultaneously de-dispersed for 448
different DMs with an integration time of 1.0 ms. In the absence of such a
multi-beam telescope, we have built a second version that handles up to 6 beams
at 0.1 ms integration time and 512 DMs. We have deployed and tested this at a
34-m antenna of the Deep Space Network in Goldstone, California. A third
version that processes up to 6 beams at an integration time of 2.0 ms and 1,024
DMs has been built and deployed at the Murchison Widefield Array telescope.

ii) no infrared tachyon for smoothed-out higher codimension branes. The effects
of the brane dynamics on the bulk are exponentially suppressed away from the

tool in time-resolved molecular spectroscopy. Here we use this technique to

excited by impulsive stimulated Raman scattering. Transient grating
spectroscopy enables us to reveal clear modulations of the harmonic emission.
This heterodyne detection shows that the harmonic emission generated between 14
to 26 eV is mainly sensitive to two among the three active Raman modes in SF6,
i.e. the strongest and fully symmetric nu 1-A1g mode (774 cm-1, 43 fs) and the
slowest mode nu5-T2g (524 cm-1, 63 fs). A time-frequency analysis of the
harmonic emission reveals additional dynamics: the strength and central
frequency of the nu 1 mode oscillate with a frequency of 52 cm-1 (640 fs). This
could be a signature of the vibration of dimers in the generating medium.
Harmonic 11 shows a remarkable behavior, oscillating in opposite phase, both on
the fast (774 cm-1) and slow (52 cm-1) timescales, which indicates a strong
modulation of the recombination matrix element as a function of the nuclear
geometry. These results demonstrate that the high sensitivity of high-order

distinct node features and link relationships between nodes. In this paper, we
propose a new transfer learning algorithm that attempts to transfer common

shared by two networks, and serve as domain-independent features to be
transferred between networks. Together with domain-dependent node features, we
thereafter propose an iterative classification algorithm that leverages label

identified by the channel quality indicator in a cell of the cellular network.
Explicit formulas strongly suggest that the bandwidth a user experiences does
not depend on the user mobility. This is because the bandwidth available by a
user who does not move and that available by a user who moves are the same or
approximately the same as a probabilistic distribution. Numerical examples show
that parameters, such as the size of regions where placement of WLAN access
points is not allowed and the mean density of WLANs in high density regions,
have a large impact on performance metrics. In particular, a homogeneous
Poisson process model as the WLAN access point location model largely
overestimates the mean available bandwidth for a user and the number of
vertical handovers. The overestimated mean available bandwidth is, for example,
about 50% in a certain condition.

very flat spectral slope in the NuSTAR energy band (Gamma=0.55^{+0.62}_{-0.64};

26-40 K. The PACS/SPIRE multi-position spectra show spatial variations of
far-IR lines that reflect the physical stratification of the nebula. We
demonstrate that spatially-resolved far-IR line diagnostics yield the (T_e,
n_e) profiles, from which distributions of ionized, atomic, and molecular gases
can be determined. Direct comparison of the dust and gas column mass maps
constrained by the HerPlaNS data allows to construct an empirical gas-to-dust
mass ratio map, which shows a range of ratios with the median of 195+-110. The
present analysis yields estimates of the total mass of the shell to be 0.86

theoretical description is still an open problem. Correspondingly, the status
of the energy-time uncertainty relation is unsettled.
  In the first part of this work the necessity of positive operator valued
measures (POVM) as descriptions of every quantum experiment is reviewed, as
well as the suggestive role played by the probability current in time
measurements. Furthermore, it is shown that no POVM exists, which approximately
agrees with the probability current on a very natural set of wave functions;
nevertheless, the choice of the set is crucial, and on more restrictive sets
the probability current does provide a good arrival time prediction. Some ideas
to experimentally detect quantum effects in time measurements are discussed.
  In the second part of the work the energy-time uncertainty relation is
considered, in particular for a model of alpha decay for which the variance of
the energy can be calculated explicitly, and the variance of time can be
estimated. This estimate is tight for systems with long lifetimes, in which
case the uncertainty relation is shown to be satisfied. Also the
linewidth-lifetime relation is shown to hold, but contrary to the common
expectation, it is found that the two relations behave independently, and
therefore it is not possible to interpret one as a consequence of the other.
  To perform the mentioned analysis quantitative scattering estimates are
necessary. To this end, bounds of the form $\|1_Re^{-iHt}\psi\|_2^2 \leq C
t^{-3}$ have been derived, where $\psi$ denotes the initial state, $H$ the
Hamiltonian, $R$ a positive constant, and $C$ is explicitly known. As

coupled whispering gallery modes in an optical microcavity. The model system
that we have chosen is the 'add-drop filter', which comprises an optical
microcavity and two waveguide coupled to the cavity. Due to the evanescent
field's scattering on the waveguide, the whispering gallery modes in the
microcavity form doublets, which manifest themselves as splittings in the
spectrum. As these doublets can be regarded as a spectral feature of dynamical
tunneling between two different dynamical states with a spatial overlap, the
effect of a Kerr nonlinearity on the doublets is numerically investigated in
the more general context of the relationship between cubic nonlinearity and
dynamical tunneling. Within the numerical realization of the model system, it
is observed that the doublets shows a bistable transition in its transmission
curve as the Kerr-nonlinearity in the cavity is increased. At the same time,
one rotational mode gets dominant over the other one in the transmission, since
the two states in the doublet have uneven linewidths. By using coupled mode
theory, the underlying mode dynamics of the phenomena is theoretically modelled
and clarified.

the formation of a network of cells embedded within the bone matrix, called
osteocytes. Osteocytes derive from bone-synthesising cells (osteoblasts) that
become buried in bone matrix during bone deposition. The generation of
osteocytes is a complex process that remains incompletely understood. Whilst
osteoblast burial determines the density of osteocytes, the expanding network
of osteocytes regulates in turn osteoblast activity and osteoblast burial. In
this paper, a spatiotemporal continuous model is proposed to investigate the
osteoblast-to-osteocyte transition. The aims of the model are (i) to link
dynamic properties of osteocyte generation with properties of the osteocyte
network imprinted in bone, and (ii) to investigate Marotti's hypothesis that
osteocytes prompt the burial of osteoblasts when they become covered with
sufficient bone matrix. Osteocyte density is assumed in the model to be
generated at the moving bone surface by a combination of osteoblast density,
matrix secretory rate, rate of entrapment, and curvature of the bone substrate,
but is found to be determined solely by the ratio of the instantaneous burial
rate and matrix secretory rate. Osteocyte density does not explicitly depend on
osteoblast density nor curvature. Osteocyte apoptosis is also included to
distinguish between the density of osteocyte lacuna and the density of live
osteocytes. Experimental measurements of osteocyte lacuna densities are used to
estimate the rate of burial of osteoblasts in bone matrix. These results
suggest that: (i) burial rate decreases during osteonal infilling, and (ii) the
control of osteoblast burial by osteocytes is likely to emanate as a collective
signal from a large group of osteocytes, rather than from the osteocytes
closest to the bone deposition front.

sensor node whose failure causes severe data losses. Deploying multiple fixed
BSs improves the robustness, yet requires all BSs to be installed with large
batteries and large energy-harvesting devices due to the high energy
consumption of BSs. In this paper, we propose a scheme to coordinate the
multiple deployed BSs such that the energy supplies required by individual BSs
can be substantially reduced. In this scheme, only one BS is selected to be
active at a time and the other BSs act as regular sensor nodes. We first
present the basic architecture of our system, including how we keep the network
running with only one active BS and how we manage the handover of the role of
the active BS. Then, we propose an algorithm for adaptively selecting the
active BS under the spatial and temporal variations of energy resources. This
algorithm is simple to implement but is also asymptotically optimal under mild
conditions. Finally, by running simulations and real experiments on an outdoor
testbed, we verify that the proposed scheme is energy-efficient, has low
communication overhead and reacts rapidly to network changes.

Cauchy problem on the two-fluid Euler-Maxwell system with collisions when
initial data are around a constant equilibrium state. The main goal is the
rigorous justification of diffusion phenomena in fluid plasma at the linear
level. Precisely, motivated by the classical Darcy's law for the nonconductive
fluid, we first give a heuristic derivation of the asymptotic equations of the
Euler-Maxwell system in large time. It turns out that both the density and the
magnetic field tend time-asymptotically to the diffusion equations with
diffusive coefficients explicitly determined by given physical parameters.
Then, in terms of the Fourier energy method, we analyze the linear dissipative
structure of the system, which implies the almost exponential time-decay
property of solutions over the high-frequency domain. The key part of the paper
is the spectral analysis of the linearized system, exactly capturing the
diffusive feature of solutions over the low-frequency domain. Finally, under
some conditions on initial data, we show the convergence of the densities and
the magnetic field to the corresponding linear diffusion waves with the rate
$(1+t)^{-5/4}$ in $L^2$ norm and also the convergence of the velocities and the
electric field to the corresponding asymptotic profiles given in the sense of
the geneneralized Darcy's law with the faster rate $(1+t)^{-7/4}$ in $L^2$
norm. Thus, this work can be also regarded as the mathematical proof of the
Darcy's law in the context of collisional fluid plasma.

reach accuracies better than 0.9 mas/yr for more than ~10000 objects with

nodes and block fading where the nodes transmit with a fixed transmission rate.
Thereby, user 1 and user 2 exchange information only via a relay node, i.e., a
direct link between both users is not present. Recently in [1], it was shown
that a considerable gain in terms of sum throughput can be obtained in
bidirectional relaying by optimally selecting the transmission modes or,
equivalently, the states of the nodes, i.e., the transmit, the receive, and the
silent states, in each time slot based on the qualities of the involved links.
To enable adaptive transmission mode selection, the relay has to be equipped
with two buffers for storage of the data received from the two users. However,
the protocol proposed in [1] was delay-unconstrained and provides an upper
bound for the performance of practical delay-constrained protocols. In this
paper, we propose a heuristic but efficient delay-constrained protocol which
can approach the performance upper bound reported in [1], even in cases where
only a small average delay is permitted. In particular, the proposed protocol
does not only take into account the instantaneous qualities of the involved
links for adaptive mode selection but also the states of the queues at the
buffers. The average throughput and the average delay of the proposed
delay-constrained protocol are evaluated by analyzing the Markov chain of the
states of the queues.

caused by the gravitational perturbation of an embedded giant planet with q=4.7
10^-3 stellar-to-planet mass ratio. Locally isothermal, 2D hydrodynamic
simulations show that the disk becomes globally eccentric inside the planetary
orbit with stationary ~0.2-0.25 average eccentricity after ~2000 orbital
periods. For orbital distances 1-10 AU, the disk eccentricity is peaked inside
the region where the fundamental band of CO is thermal excitated. Hence, these
lines become a sensitive indicators of the embedded planet via their
asymmetries (both in flux and wavelength). We find that the line shape
distortions (e.g. distance, central dip, asymmetry and positions of peaks) of a
given transition depend on the excitation energy (i.e. on the rotational
quantum number J). The magnitude of line asymmetry is increasing/decreasing
with J if the planet orbits inside/outside the CO excitation zone (R_CO<=3, 5
and 7 AU for a 0.5,1 and 2 Solar mass star, respectively), thus one can
constrain the orbital distance of a giant planet by determining the slope of
peak asymmetry-J profile. We conclude that the presented spectroscopic
phenomenon can be used to test the predictions of planet formation theories by
pushing the age limits for detecting the youngest planetary systems.

defined by Tomamichel and Hayashi which have the particular advantage of
satisfying the data-processing inequality, i.e. monotonicity under quantum

relative entropies have a second order asymptotic expansion, which in turn
yields tight second order asymptotics for optimal rates of these tasks in the
i.i.d. setting. The tasks studied in this paper are fixed-length quantum source
coding, noisy dense coding, entanglement concentration, pure-state entanglement
dilution, and transmission of information through a classical-quantum channel.
In the latter case, we retrieve the second order asymptotics obtained by
Tomamichel and Tan. Our results also yield the known second order asymptotics
of fixed-length classical source coding derived by Hayashi. The second order
asymptotics of entanglement concentration and dilution provide a refinement of
the inefficiency of these protocols - a quantity which, in the case of
entanglement dilution, was studied by Harrow and Lo. We prove how the
discrepancy between the optimal rates of these two processes in the second
order implies the irreversibility of entanglement concentration established by
Kumagai and Hayashi. In addition, the spectral divergence rates of the
Information Spectrum Approach (ISA) can be retrieved from our relative
entropies in the asymptotic limit. This enables us to directly obtain the more

based on a hash table value which is already distributed and provides key based
facilities like checking and caching to detect node clones. The later one is
using probabilistic directed forwarding technique and border determination. The

dispersion relations in magnonic structures. Characteristic of the method is
that a limited area of the system is continuously excited with a spatially
uniform oscillating field, tuned at a given frequency. After a transitory time,
the regime magnetization dynamics is collected and a spatial Fourier analysis
on it determines the frequency vs wave vector relation. Combining several
simulations in any predetermined range of frequencies, at any resolution, we
investigate the dispersion relations for different kinds of magnonic crystals:
a dot array, an antidot array, and a bicomponent film. Especially compared to
traditional pulse-excitation methods this technique has many advantages. First,
the excitation power is concentrated at a single frequency, allowing the
corresponding spin waves to propagate with very low attenuation, resulting in a
higher k-space resolution. Second, the model allows to include very large wave
vector components, necessary to describe the high-frequency response of
non-quantized spin waves in quasi-continuous systems. Finally, we address some
possible experimental opportunities with respect to excitation/detection
techniques over large distances and the observation of the odd/even symmetry of
spin waves using Brillouin light scattering.

electron neutrinos in a muon neutrino beam. The main and irreducible background
to the appearance signal comes from the presence in the neutrino beam of a
small intrinsic component of electron neutrinos originating from muon and kaon
decays. In T2K, this component is expected to represent 1.2% of the total
neutrino flux. A measurement of this component using the near detector (ND280),
located 280 m from the target, is presented. The charged current interactions
of electron neutrinos are selected by combining the particle identification
capabilities of both the time projection chambers and electromagnetic
calorimeters of ND280. The measured ratio between the observed electron
neutrino beam component and the prediction is 1.01+-0.10 providing a direct
confirmation of the neutrino fluxes and neutrino cross section modeling used
for T2K neutrino oscillation analyses. Electron neutrinos coming from muons and
kaons decay are also separately measured, resulting in a ratio with respect to
the prediction of 0.68+-0.30 and 1.10+-0.14, respectively.

expected upturn of the survival probability of low energy solar boron
neutrinos. This is because this super-light sterile neutrino can oscillate
efficiently with electron neutrino through a MSW resonance happened in Sun. One
may naturally expect that a similar resonance should happen for neutrinos
propagating in Earth matter. We study the flavor conversion of this super-light
sterile neutrino with active neutrinos in Earth matter. We find that the
scenario of the super-light sterile neutrino can easily pass through possible
constraints from experiments which can test the Earth matter effect in
oscillation of neutrinos. Interestinlgy, we find that this is because the
naively expected resonant conversion disappears or is significantly suppressed
due to the presence of a potential $V_n$ which arises from neutral current
interaction of neutrino with neutrons in matter. In contrast, the neutron
number density in the Sun is negligible and the effect of $V_n$ is effectively
switched off. This enables the MSW resonance in Sun needed in oscillation of
the super-light sterile neutrino with solar electron neutrinos. It's
interesting to note that it is the different situation in the Sun and in the
Earth that makes $V_n$ effectively turned off and turned on respectively. This
observation makes the scenario of the super-light sterile neutrino quite

sky providing an excellent opportunity for studying UV star counts. The aim of
our study is to investigate in detail the observed UV star counts obtained by
GALEX vis-a-vis the model simulated catalogs produced by the Besancon model of
stellar population synthesis in various Galactic directions, and to explore the
potential for studying the structure of our Galaxy from images in multiple NUV
and FUV filters of the forthcoming Ultraviolet Imaging Telescope (UVIT) to be
flown onboard ASTROSAT. We have upgraded the Besancon model of stellar
population synthesis to include the UV bands of GALEX and UVIT. Depending on
the availability of contiguous GALEX, SDSS, WISE and 2MASS overlapping regions,
we have chosen a set of 19 GALEX fields which spread over a range of Galactic
directions. We cross-matched GALEX sources with the WISE+2MASS and SDSS
catalogs and UV stars in the GALEX catalog are identified by choosing a
suitable IR colour, J - W1 (W1 is a WISE band at 3.4 microns). The IR colour
cut method, which is used for the first time for separation of stars, is
discussed in comparison with the GALEX+SDSS star counts method. We present the
results of the UV star counts analysis carried out using the data from GALEX.
We find that the Besancon model simulations represent the observed star counts
of both the GALEX AIS and MIS well within the error bars in various Galactic
directions. Based on the model analysis, we separated out white dwarfs of the
disc and blue horizontal branch stars of the halo from the observed sample by
selecting a suitable FUV - NUV colour. The Besancon model is now ready for
further comparisons in the UV domain and will be used for prospective studies
for the UVIT instrument to be flown onboard ASTROSAT.

dynamos in disc galaxies to assess their applicability and accuracy, and thus
to suggest a set of simple solutions suitable to model the large-scale galactic
magnetic fields in various contexts. The dynamo saturation mechanisms
considered are the magnetic helicity balance involving helicity fluxes (the
dynamical $\alpha$-quenching) and an algebraic $\alpha$-quenching. The
non-linear solutions are then compared with the marginal kinematic and
asymptotic solutions. We also discuss the accuracy of the no-$z$ approximation.
Although these tools are very different in the degree of approximation and
hence complexity, they all lead to remarkably similar solutions for the mean
magnetic field. In particular, we show that the algebraic $\alpha$-quenching
non-linearity can be obtained from a more physical dynamical $\alpha$-quenching
model in the limit of nearly azimuthal magnetic field. This suggests, for
instance, that earlier results on galactic disc dynamos based on the simple
algebraic non-linearity are likely to be reliable, and that estimates based on
simple, even linear models are often a good starting point. We suggest improved
no-$z$ and algebraic $\alpha$-quenching models, and also incorporate galactic
outflows into a simple analytical dynamo model to show that the outflow can
produce leading magnetic spirals near the disc surface. The simple dynamo
models developed are applied to estimate the magnetic pitch angle and the
arm-interarm contrast in the saturated magnetic field strength for realistic
parameter values.

rivaling experimental repeats, observed empirical replication timing program in

to the choice of the genomic landmark that localizes initiation, only a single
adjustable parameter of direct biological relevance: the number of replication
forks. We find that DNase hypersensitive sites are optimal and independent

one-species Vlasov-Poisson-Boltzmann system which describes mutual interactions
of the electrons through collisions in the self-consistent electrostatic field.
For cutoff intermolecular interactions, although there are some progress on the
construction of global smooth solutions to its Cauchy problem near Maxwellians
recently, the problem for the case of very soft potentials remains unsolved. By
introducing a new time-velocity weighted energy method and based on some new
optimal temporal decay estimates on the solution itself and some of its
derivatives with respect to both the spatial and the velocity variables, it is
shown in this manuscript that the Cauchy problem of the one-species
Vlasov-Poisson-Boltzmann system for all cutoff soft potentials does exist a
unique global smooth solution for general initial perturbation which is
unnecessary to satisfy the neutral condition imposed in [13] for the case of
cutoff moderately soft potentials but is assumed to be small in certain
weighted Sobolev spaces. Our approach applies also to the case of cutoff hard
potentials and thus provides a satisfactory global well-posedness theory to the
one-species Vlasov-Poisson-Boltzmann system near Maxwellians for the whole
range of cutoff intermolecular interactions in the perturbative framework.

has theoretically been questioned and they are probably not needed in the
modelling of the chemical evolution of F in the solar neighborhood. It has,
however, been suggested that W-R stars are indeed needed to explain the
chemical evolution of F in the Bulge. The molecular spectral data of the often
used HF-molecule has not been presented in a complete and consistent way and
has recently been debated in the literature. In this article we determine the
[F/O] vs. [O/H] trend in the Bulge to investigate the possible contribution
from W-R stars. Additionally, we present here a HF line list for the K- and
L-bands (including the often used 23358.33 {\AA} line) and an accompanying
partition function. The F abundances were determined using spectral fitting
from hi-res NIR spectra of eight K giants recorded by the spectrograph CRIRES.
We have also re-analyzed five previously published Bulge giants using our new
HF molecular data. We find that the F-O abundance in the Bulge probably cannot
be explained with chemical evolution models including only AGB-stars and the
{\nu}-process in SNe Type II, i.e. a significant amount of F production in W-R
stars is likely needed to explain the F abundance in the Bulge. Concerning the
HF line list, we find that a possible reason for the inconsistencies in the
literature, with two different excitation energies being used, is two different
definitions of the zero-point energy for the HF molecule and therefore also two
accompanying different dissociation energies. Both line lists are correct, as
long as the corresponding consistent partition function is used in the spectral
synthesis. However, we suspect this has not been the case in several earlier
works leading to F abundances 0.3 dex too high.

contributions are calculated within the so-called factorized Ansatz and each
step of DPS is calculated in the LO collinear approximation. The LO pQCD
calculations are shown to give a reasonably good descritption of recent CMS and
ATLAS data on inclusive jet production and therefore this formalism can be used
to reliably estimate the DPS effects. Relative contribution of DPS is growing
at large rapidity distance between jets. This is consistent with our experience
from previous studies of double-parton scattering effects in the case of open
and hidden charm production. The calculated differential cross sections as a
function of rapidity distance between the most remote in rapidity jets are
compared with recent results of LL and NLL BFKL calculations for
Mueller-Navelet (MN) jet production at $\sqrt{s} = 7$ TeV. The DPS contribution
to widely rapidity separated jet production is carefully studied for the
present energy $\sqrt{s}$ = 7 TeV and also at the nominal LHC energy $\sqrt{s}$
= 14 TeV and in different ranges of jet transverse momenta. The differential
cross section as a function of dijet transverse momenta as well as
two-dimensional ($p_{T}(y_{min})\times p_{T}(y_{max})$)-plane correlations for
DPS mechanism are also presented. Some ideas how the DPS effects could be
studied in the case of double dijet production are suggested.

causes a variety of quantum ordered states that may, in some cases, coexist. It
has long been believed, however, that such coexistence among ferromagnetic
ordering, superconductivity and heavy-fermion behavior is impossible, as the
first supports parallel spin alignment while the conventional understanding of
the latter two phenomena assumes spin-singlet or anti-parallel spins. This
understanding has recently been challenged by an increasing number of
observations in uranium systems (UGe2, URhGe, UIr and UCoGe) in which
superconductivity is found within a ferromagnetic state and, more
fundamentally, both ordering phenomena are exhibited by the same set of heavy
5f electrons. Since the coexistence of superconductivity and ferromagnetism is
at odds with the standard theory of phonon-mediated spin-singlet
superconductivity, it requires an alternative pairing mechanism, in which
electrons are bound into spin-triplet pairs by spin fluctuations. Within the
heavy-fermion scenario, this alternative mechanism assumes that the magnetism
has a band character and that said band forms from heavy quasiparticles
composed of f electrons. This band is expected to be responsible for all three
phenomena although its nature and the nature of those heavy quasiparticles
still remains unclear. Here we report spectroscopic evidence for the formation
in UGe2 of subnanometer-sized spin polarons whose dynamics we follow into the
paramagnetic and ferromagnetic phases. These spin polarons behave as heavy
carriers and thus may serve as heavy quasiparticles made of 5f electrons; once
coherence is established, they form a narrow spin-polaron band which thus
provides a natural reconciliation of itinerant ferromagnetism with spin-triplet
superconductivity and heavy-fermion behavior.

signatures of the dominant contributor of the optical light.
  We report on the first detection of orbital motion in these two objects. For

112313 a full period is not yet covered, despite our 1807 days of monitoring.
The radial-velocity amplitude shows that it is unlikely that the orbital plane
is co-planar with the one defined by the nebular waist of the bipolar nebula.
To our knowledge these are the first detections of orbits in PNe that are in a
range from several weeks to a few years.
  The orbital properties and chemical composition of BD+33.2642 are similar to
what is found in post-AGB binaries with circumbinary discs. The latter are
probably progenitors of these PNe. For LoTr5 the Ba-rich central star and the
long orbital period are similar to the Ba star giants, which hence serve as
natural progeny. In contrast to the central star in LoTr5, normal Ba stars are
slow rotators. The orbits of these systems have a low probability of occurrence

high redshift galaxies may indicate that large scale magnetic fields have a
primordial origin. If primordial magnetic fields were present soon after the
recombination epoch, they would have induced density fluctuations on the one
hand and dissipated their energy into the primordial gas on the other, and
thereby significantly alter the thermal history of the Universe. Here we
consider both the effects and calculate the brightness temperature fluctuations
of the 21cm line using simple Monte Carlo simulations. We find that the
fluctuations of the 21cm line from the energy dissipation appear only on very
small scales and those from the density fluctuations always dominate on
observationally relevant angular scales.

surface layers leads to sublimation of the underlying ices and subsequent
outgassing that promotes the observed emission of gas and dust. The ejection of
dust requires that the forces binding the dust particles to the comet nucleus
must be overcome by the forces caused by the sublimation process. This relates
to the question of how large the tensile strength of the overlying dust layer
is. Homogeneous layers of micrometer-sized dust particles reach tensile
strengths of typically $10^3$ to $10^4$ Pa. This exceeds by far the maximum
sublimation pressure of water ice in comets. It is therefore unclear how
cometary dust activity is driven. To solve this paradox, we used the model by
Skorov and Blum (Icarus 221, 1-11, 2012), who assumed that cometesimals formed
by gravitational instability of a cloud of dust and ice aggregates and
calculated for the corresponding structure of comet nuclei tensile strength of
the dust-aggregate layers on the order of 1 Pa. Here we present evidence that
the emitted cometary dust particles are indeed aggregates with the right
properties to fit the model by Skorov and Blum. Then we experimentally measure
the tensile strengths of layers of laboratory dust aggregates and confirm the
values derived by the model. To explain the comet activity driven by the
evaporation of water ice, we derive a minimum size for the dust aggregates of
$\sim 1$ mm, in agreement with meteoroid observations and dust-agglomeration
models in the solar nebula. Finally we conclude that cometesimals must have
formed by gravitational instability, because all alternative formation models
lead to higher tensile strengths of the surface layers.

enabled by means of an applied magnetic field, in the presence of which we
demonstrate the predicted distortions of the FR. This general scheme for

paper ""On Petersburg game."" Matematicheskii sbornik, Volume 32, No 2, 1925, pp.

theorems and confirms his results providing concrete empirical dependencies of
the frequencies corresponding to geometric and arithmetic mean payments on the
number of Petersburg games.

bottlenecks in today's communication, electronics, and biomedical systems.
However, given the continuous nature of optics, the inability to efficiently
analyze optical system models using traditional paper-and-pencil and computer
simulation approaches sets limits especially in safety-critical applications.
In order to overcome these limitations, we propose to employ higher-order-logic
theorem proving as a complement to computational and numerical approaches to
improve optical model analysis in a comprehensive framework. The proposed
framework allows formal analysis of optical systems at four abstraction levels,
i.e., ray, wave, electromagnetic, and quantum.

blow-up limits of Mumford-Shah minimizers. We prove a new monotonicity formula
for the energy of $u$ when the singular set $K$ is contained in a smooth enough
cone. We then use this monotonicity to prove that for any reduced global
minimizer $(u,K)$ in $\R^3$, if $K$ is contained in a half-plane and touching
its edge, then it is the half-plane itself. This partially answers to a
question of Guy David.

asymmetries is instructive to put in evidence the role of thermodynamics even
in the discussion of mechanical aspects. We illustrate the discussion with the
well known example of a person on a rotating platform outstretching and
contracting his/her arms, and also with other common situations such as jumping

from multisensor images. Most earth satellites such as SPOT, Landsat 7, IKONOS
and QuickBird provide both panchromatic (Pan) images at a higher spatial
resolution and multispectral (MS) images at a lower spatial resolution and many
remote sensing applications require both high spatial and high spectral
resolutions, especially for GIS based applications. An effective image fusion
technique can produce such remotely sensed images. Image fusion is the
combination of two or more different images to form a new image by using a
certain algorithm to obtain more and better information about an object or a
study area than. The image fusion is performed at three different processing
levels which are pixel level, feature level and decision level according to the
stage at which the fusion takes place. There are many image fusion methods that
can be used to produce high resolution multispectral images from a high
resolution pan image and low resolution multispectral images. This paper
explores the major remote sensing data fusion techniques at pixel level and
reviews the concept, principals, limitations and advantages for each technique.
This paper focused on traditional techniques like intensity hue-saturation-
(HIS), Brovey, principal component analysis (PCA) and Wavelet.
