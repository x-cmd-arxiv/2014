Relativity (GR) containing (Planck's scale-suppressed) Ricci-squared terms is
considered. The theory is formulated assuming the metric and connection to be
independent (Palatini formalism) and is probed using a charged null fluid as a
matter source. This has the following effect: starting from Minkowski space,
when the flux is active the metric becomes a charged Vaidya-type one, and once
the flux is switched off the metric settles down into a static configuration
such that far from the Planck scale the geometry is virtually indistinguishable
from that of the standard Reissner-Nordstr\""om solution of GR. However, the
innermost region undergoes significant changes, as the GR singularity is
generically replaced by a wormhole structure. Such a structure becomes
completely regular for a certain charge-to-mass ratio. Moreover, the nontrivial
topology of the wormhole allows to define a charge in terms of lines of force
trapped in the topology such that the density of lines flowing across the
wormhole throat becomes a universal constant. To the light of our results we
comment on the physical significance of curvature divergences in this theory
and the topology change issue, which support the view that space-time could
have a foam-like microstructure pervaded by wormholes generated by quantum
gravitational effects.

results in unstable, neutron rich fission products that subsequently beta decay

physics research from the initial discovery of the neutrino to current
precision measurements of neutrino mixing angles. The prediction of the
absolute flux and energy spectrum of the emitted reactor neutrinos hinges upon
a series of seminal papers based on measurements performed in the 1970s and
1980s. The steadily improving reactor neutrino measurement techniques and
recent re-considerations of the agreement between the predicted and observed
reactor neutrino flux motivates revisiting the underlying beta spectra
measurements. A method is proposed to use an accelerator proton beam delivered
to an engineered target to yield a neutron field tailored to reproduce the
neutron energy spectrum present in the core of an operating nuclear reactor.
Foils of the primary reactor fissionable isotopes placed in this tailored
neutron flux will ultimately emit beta particles from the resultant fission
products. Measurement of these beta particles in a time projection chamber with
a perpendicular magnetic field provides a distinctive set of systematic
considerations for comparison to the original seminal beta spectra
measurements. Ancillary measurements such as gamma-ray emission and
post-irradiation radiochemical analysis will further constrain the absolute
normalization of beta emissions per fission. The requirements for unfolding the
beta spectra measured with this method into a predicted reactor neutrino

6-fold increase in impurity scattering does not shift Pc. From a study of X-ray
diffraction on KFe2As2 under pressure, we report the pressure dependence of
lattice constants and As-Fe-As bond angle. The pressure dependence of these
lattice parameters suggests that Pc should be significantly higher in CsFe2As2
than in KFe2As2, but we find on the contrary that Pc is lower in CsFe2As2.
Resistivity measurements under pressure reveal a change of regime across Pc,

which takes into account thermochemical kinetics, photochemistry, vertical
mixing, and horizontal transport, the latter being modeled as a uniform zonal
wind. We have applied the model to the atmospheres of the hot Jupiters HD
209458b and HD 189733b. The adopted eddy diffusion coefficients are calculated
by following the behaviour of passive tracers in three-dimensional general
circulation models, which results in eddy values significantly below previous
estimates. We find that the distribution of molecules with altitude and
longitude in the atmospheres of these two hot Jupiters is complex because of
the interplay of the various physical and chemical processes at work. Much of
the distribution of molecules is driven by the strong zonal wind and the
limited extent of vertical transport, resulting in an important homogenisation
of the chemical composition with longitude. In general, molecular abundances
are quenched horizontally to values typical of the hottest dayside regions, and
thus the composition in the cooler nightside regions is highly contaminated by
that of warmer dayside regions. As a consequence, the abundance of methane
remains low, even below the predictions of previous one-dimensional models,
which is likely to be in conflict with the high CH4 content inferred from
observations of the dayside of HD 209458b. Another consequence of the important
longitudinal homogenisation of the abundances is that the variability of the
chemical composition has little effect on the way the emission spectrum is
modified with phase and on the changes in the transmission spectrum from the
transit ingress to the egress, these variations in the spectra being mainly due
to changes in the temperature rather than in the composition between the
different sides of the planet.

that the insulating nature of the gap could be compromised by unavoidable
structural defects, by topological in-gap states, or that the electronic
structure could be altogether changed by many-body effects. Here we directly
follow the excited carriers in bilayer graphene on a femtosecond time scale,
using ultrafast time- and angle-resolved photoemission. We find a behavior
consistent with a single-particle band gap. Compared to monolayer graphene, the
existence of this band gap leads to an increased carrier lifetime in the
minimum of the lowest conduction band. This is in sharp contrast to the second
sub-state of the conduction band, in which the excited electrons decay through
fast, phonon-assisted inter-band transitions.

torsional oscillations of large amplitude. The torsional oscillations could
lead to observable electromagnetic signals if strange stars have a crystalline
color superconducting crust. Indeed, considering a simple model of strange star
with a bare quark matter surface, it turns out that a positive charge is
localized in a narrow shell about ten Fermi thick beneath the star surface. The
electrons needed to neutralize the positive charge of quarks spill in the star
exterior forming an electromagnetically bounded atmosphere hundreds of Fermi
thick. When a torsional oscillation is excited, for example by a stellar
glitch, the positive charge oscillates with typical kHz frequencies, for a
crust thickness of about one-tenth of the stellar radius, to hundreds of Hz,
for a crust thickness of about nine-tenths of the stellar radius. Higher
frequencies, of the order of few GHz, can be reached if the star crust is of

eventual spin-spin) interactions, and the opportunity of measuring spins
directly through GW observations. In this letter we analyze simulated signals
emitted by spinning binaries with several values of masses, spins, orientation,

estimated to accuracy of a few percent for neutron star--black hole systems and
$\sim$ 5-30% for black hole binaries. In contrast, the difference in the
azimuth angles of the spins, which may be used to check if spins are locked
into resonant configurations, cannot be constrained. We observe that the best
performances are obtained when the line of sight is perpendicular to the
system's total angular momentum, and that a sudden change of behavior occurs
when a system is observed from angles such that the plane of the orbit can be
seen both from above and below during the time the signal is in band. This
study suggests that the measurement of black hole spin by means of GWs can be
as precise as what can be obtained from X-ray binaries.

as the Rossby deformation radius is resolved. We discuss the boundary
conditions in each step, when no-slip boundary conditions are imposed to the
problem. We validate the algorithm by a periodic flow on an f-plane with exact
solutions. The order-of-accuracy for the proposed algorithm is tested
numerically. We illustrate a quasi-steady-state solution of the double-gyre
model via the height anomaly and the contour of stream function for the
formation of double-gyre circulation in a closed basin. Our calculations are
highly consistent with the results reported in the literature. Finally, we
present an application, in which the double-gyre model is coupled with the
advection equation for modeling transport of a pollutant in a closed ocean
basin.

quench of the interaction parameter. We focus on the momentum distribution of
the excitations, $n_{\mathbf k}$, and observe that larger ${\mathbf k}$ modes
will equilibrate faster, as has been claimed in recent experimental work. We
identify three time regimes. At short times $n_{\mathbf k}$ exhibits
oscillations; these are damped out at intermediate times where the system
appears to be in a false-equilibrium. Finally, at longer times, full
equilibration occurs. This false-equilibrium is associated with the necessarily
slower relaxation of the condensate which sufficiently high ${\mathbf
k}$-states (of the excitation response) will then quasi-adiabatically follow.
Our work bears on the recent literature focus on interaction quench
experiments. We take issue with the fact that theories to date assume that the
oscillatory regime is adequate for addressing experiments.

  Indeterminism' in the Light of Quantum Mechanics and Probability Theory","139 pages, PhD thesis",,,,"quant-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this PhD thesis the ancient question of determinism ('Does every event
have a cause ?') will be re-examined. In the philosophy of science and physics
communities the orthodox position states that the physical world is
indeterministic: quantum events would have no causes but happen by irreducible
chance. Arguably the clearest theorem that leads to this conclusion is Bell's
theorem. The commonly accepted 'solution' to the theorem is 'indeterminism', in
agreement with the Copenhagen interpretation. Here it is recalled that
indeterminism is not really a physical but rather a philosophical hypothesis,
and that it has counterintuitive and far-reaching implications. At the same
time another solution to Bell's theorem exists, often termed 'superdeterminism'
or 'total determinism'. Superdeterminism appears to be a philosophical position
that is centuries and probably millennia old: it is for instance Spinoza's
determinism. If Bell's theorem has both indeterministic and deterministic
solutions, choosing between determinism and indeterminism is a philosophical
question, not a matter of physical experimentation, as is widely believed. If
it is impossible to use physics for deciding between both positions, it is
legitimate to ask which philosophical theories are of help. Here it is argued
that probability theory - more precisely the interpretation of probability - is
instrumental for advancing the debate. It appears that the hypothesis of
determinism allows to answer a series of precise questions from probability
theory, while indeterminism remains silent for these questions. From this point
of view determinism appears to be the most reasonable assumption, after all.

cold, dense cloud L1544 allow a direct comparison between observations and
chemical models for oxygen species in conditions just before star formation. We
explain a chemical model for gas phase water, simplified for the limited number
of reactions or processes that are active in extreme cold ($<$ 15 K). In this
model, water is removed from the gas phase by freezing onto grains and by
photodissociation. Water is formed as ice on the surface of dust grains from O
and OH and released into the gas phase by photodesorption. The reactions are
fast enough with respect to the slow dynamical evolution of L1544 that the gas
phase water is in equilibrium for the local conditions thoughout the cloud. We
explain the paradoxical radiative transfer of the H$_2$O ($1_{10}-1_{01}$)
line. Despite discouragingly high optical depth caused by the large Einstein A
coefficient, the subcritical excitation in the cold, rarefied H$_2$ causes the
line brightness to scale linearly with column density. Thus the water line can
provide information on the chemical and dynamical processes in the darkest
region in the center of a cold, dense cloud. The inverse P-Cygni profile of the
observed water line generally indicates a contracting cloud. This profile is
reproduced with a dynamical model of slow contraction from unstable
quasi-static hydrodynamic equilibrium (an unstable Bonnor-Ebert sphere).

sky maps: two extragalactic point source lists and one pulsar source list. The
first extragalactic candidate list consists of 709 candidates selected from the
Fermi-LAT 2FGL catalog. The second extragalactic candidate list contains 31
candidates selected from the TeVCat source catalog that have been detected by
imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes (IACTs). In both extragalactic
candidate lists Mkn 421 was the only source detected by Milagro. This paper
presents the Milagro TeV flux for Mkn 421 and flux limits for the brighter
Fermi-LAT extragalactic sources and for all TeVCat candidates. The pulsar list
extends a previously published Milagro targeted search for Galactic sources.
With the 32 new gamma-ray pulsars identified in 2FGL, the number of pulsars
that are studied by both Fermi-LAT and Milagro is increased to 52. In this
sample, we find that the probability of Milagro detecting a TeV emission
coincident with a pulsar increases with the GeV flux observed by the Fermi-LAT
in the energy range from 0.1 GeV to 100 GeV.

there is no solution of the equation beyond $t_{\rm c}$. We newly introduce the
notion of weak solution to get the global solution including the infrared limit
$t\rightarrow \infty$ and investigate its properties. The obtained weak
solution is global and unique, and it perfectly describes the physically

problem, see [21], it is not specified which notion of spectrum underlies the
theorem. In this paper we prove the quaternionic spectral theorem for unitary
operators using the $S$-spectrum. In the case of quaternionic matrices, the
$S$-spectrum coincides with the right-spectrum and so our result recovers the
well known theorem for matrices. The notion of $S$-spectrum is relatively new,
see [17], and has been used for quaternionic linear operators, as well as for
$n$-tuples of not necessarily commuting operators, to define and study a
noncommutative versions of the Riesz-Dunford functional calculus. The main
tools to prove the spectral theorem for unitary operators are the quaternionic
version of Herglotz's theorem, which relies on the new notion of $q$-positive
measure, and quaternionic spectral measures, which are related to the
quaternionic Riesz projectors defined by means of the $S$-resolvent operator
and the $S$-spectrum. The results in this paper restore the analogy with the

context-awareness and pro-activity are of fundamental importance. Behavioral
identifications enable to abstract higher-level concepts that are interesting
to applications. This work proposes the unified logical-based framework to
recognize and analyze behavioral specifications understood as a formal logic
language that avoids ambiguity typical for natural languages. Automatically
discovering behaviors from sensory data streams as formal specifications is of
fundamental importance to build seamless human-computer interactions. Thus, the
knowledge about environment behaviors expressed in terms of temporal logic
formulas constitutes a base for the reactive and precise reasoning processes to
support trustworthy, unambiguous and pro-active decisions for applications that
are smart and context-aware.

  communication systems: high performance and low complexity","24 pages,16 figures, submitted for a journal",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In orthogonal frequency division modulation (OFDM) communication systems,
channel state information (CSI) is required at receiver due to the fact that
frequency-selective fading channel leads to disgusting inter-symbol
interference (ISI) over data transmission. Broadband channel model is often
described by very few dominant channel taps and they can be probed by
compressive sensing based sparse channel estimation (SCE) methods, e.g.,
orthogonal matching pursuit algorithm, which can take the advantage of sparse
structure effectively in the channel as for prior information. However, these
developed methods are vulnerable to both noise interference and column
coherence of training signal matrix. In other words, the primary objective of
these conventional methods is to catch the dominant channel taps without a
report of posterior channel uncertainty. To improve the estimation performance,
we proposed a compressive sensing based Bayesian sparse channel estimation
(BSCE) method which can not only exploit the channel sparsity but also mitigate
the unexpected channel uncertainty without scarifying any computational
complexity. The propose method can reveal potential ambiguity among multiple
channel estimators that are ambiguous due to observation noise or correlation
interference among columns in the training matrix. Computer simulations show
that propose method can improve the estimation performance when comparing with
conventional SCE methods.

flexibility to handle the structures that occur in the development of a

  An ether is a periodic pattern of cells that arises in some cellular automata
from almost all random initial configurations. In this thesis, the formalism is
developed in detail and then applied to the problem of ether formation. For the
elementary cellular automaton Rule 54, a partial result is proved: There is a
fragment of the ether that arises with probability 1 from every random initial
configuration and is propagated with probability 1 to any later time. This is a
strong argument that the ether under Rule 54 indeed arises from almost all

The decision of whether or not to insert this beam-splitter can be made after
the photon has entered the interferometer, as in Wheeler's famous
delayed-choice thought experiment. In recent quantum versions of this

Wigner function. We show that this enables the wave and particle aspects of the

different information rates within a session. How to deal with information
transmission and network error correction simultaneously under different rates
is introduced in this paper as a variable-rate network error correction
problem. Apparently, linear network error correction MDS codes are expected to
be used for these different rates. For this purpose, designing a linear network
error correction MDS code based on the existing results for each information
rate is an efficient solution. In order to solve the problem more efficiently,
we present the concept of variable-rate linear network error correction MDS
codes, that is, these linear network error correction MDS codes of different

propose an approach to construct such a family of variable-rate network MDS
codes and give an algorithm for efficient implementation. This approach saves
the storage space for each internal node, and resources and time for the
transmission on networks. Moreover, the performance of our proposed algorithm
is analyzed, including the field size, the time complexity, the encoding
complexity at the source node, and the decoding methods. Finally, a random
method is introduced for constructing variable-rate network MDS codes and we
obtain a lower bound on the success probability of this random method, which
shows that this probability will approach to one as the base field size goes to

studied. We discuss a specific example for which the stationary measure
displays either a second order (continuous) or a first order (discontinuous)
phase transition and a tricritical point. In situations where a first order
phase transition is observed, the dynamics are bistable. Then, the transition
paths between two coexisting attractors are instantons (fluctuation paths from
an attractor to a saddle), which are related to the relaxation paths of the
corresponding dual dynamics. For this example, we show how one can analytically
determine the instantons and compute the transition probabilities for rare

Rev. Lett., 109, 175003 (2012). We show that recent arguments for light
amplification driven by inhomogeneous quantum spin fields in low temperature
electron plasmas in metals are invalid. In essence, a neglect of Pauli
`blocking' led the authors to over-estimate the effects of intrinsic spin.

Abell 48 exhibits spectral features similar to massive nitrogen-sequence
Wolf-Rayet stars. This raises a pertinent question, whether it is still a
planetary nebula or rather a ring nebula of a massive star. In this study, we
have constructed a three-dimensional photoionization model of Abell 48,
constrained by our new optical integral field spectroscopy. An analysis of the
spatially resolved velocity distributions allowed us to constrain the geometry
of Abell 48. We used the collisionally excited lines to obtain the nebular
physical conditions and ionic abundances of nitrogen, oxygen, neon, sulphur and
argon, relative to hydrogen. We also determined helium temperatures and ionic
abundances of helium and carbon from the optical recombination lines. We
obtained a good fit to the observations for most of the emission-line fluxes in
our photoionization model. The ionic abundances deduced from our model are in
decent agreement with those derived by the empirical analysis. However, we
notice obvious discrepancies between helium temperatures derived from the model
and the empirical analysis, as overestimated by our model. This could be due to
the presence of a small fraction of cold metal-rich structures, which were not
included in our model. It is found that the observed nebular line fluxes were
best reproduced by using a hydrogen-deficient expanding model atmosphere as the
ionizing source with an effective temperature of 70 kK and a stellar luminosity
of 5500 L_sun, which corresponds to a relatively low-mass progenitor star (~ 3
M_sun) rather than a massive Pop I star.

quasistatic electric fields that do not propagate. Laser fields are transverse:
plane wave fields that possess the ability to propagate. Although there is an
approximate connection between the effects of longitudinal and transverse
fields in a useful range of frequencies, that equivalence fails completely at
very low frequencies. Insight into this breakdown is given by an examination of
radiation pressure, which is a unique transverse-field effect whose relative
importance increases rapidly as the frequency declines. Radiation pressure can
be ascribed to photon momentum, which does not exist for longitudinal fields.
Two major consequences are that the near-universal acceptance of a static
electric field as the zero frequency limit of a laser field is not correct; and
that the numerical solution of the dipole-approximate Schr\""{o}dinger equation
for laser effects is inapplicable as the frequency declines. These problems
occur because the magnetic component of the laser field is very important at
low frequencies, and hence the dipole approximation is not valid. Some
experiments already exist that demonstrate the failure of tunneling concepts at
low frequencies.

optical access network systems that require cost reduction of optical and
photonic components. Low cost, ease of fabrication, and integration
capabilities of low optical-loss polymers make them attractive for photonic
applications. In addition to passive wave-guiding components, electro-optic
(EO) polymers consisting of a polymeric matrix doped with organic nonlinear
chromophores have enabled wide-RF-bandwidth and low-power optical modulators.
Beside board level passive and active optical components, compact on-chip
modulators (a few 100 micronmeters to a few millimeters) have been made
possible by hybrid integration of EO polymers onto the silicon platform. This
paper summarizes some of the recent progress in polymer based optical
modulators and interconnects. A highly linear, broadband directional coupler
modulator for use in analog optical links and compact, and low-power
silicon/polymer hybrid slot photonic crystal waveguide modulators for on chip
applications are presented. Recently, cost-effective roll-to-roll fabrication
of electronic and photonic systems on flexible substrates has been gaining
interest. A low-cost imprinted/ink-jet-printed Mach-Zehnder modulator and
board-to-board optical interconnects using microlens integrated 45-degree
mirror couplers compatible with the roll-to-roll fabrication platforms are also
presented.

frequency analog optical links. Existing commercial LiNibO3 Mach-Zehnder
modulators have intrinsic drawbacks in linearity to provide high fidelity
communication. In this paper, we present the design, fabrication and
characterization of a traveling wave directional coupler modulator based on
electro-optic polymer, which is able to provide high linearity, high speed, and
low optical insertion loss. A silver ground electrode is used to reduce
waveguide sidewall roughness due to the scattering of UV light in
photolithography process in addition to suppressing the RF loss. A 1-to-2
multi-mode interference 3dB-splitter, a photobleached refractive index taper
and a quasi-vertical taper are used to reduce the optical insertion loss of the
device. The symmetric waveguide structure of the MMI-fed directional coupler is
intrinsically bias-free, and the modulation is obtained at the 3-dB point
regardless of the ambient temperature. By achieving low RF loss, characteristic
impedance matching with 50{\Omega} load, and excellent velocity matching
between the RF wave and the optical wave, a travelling wave electrode is
designed to function up to 62.5GHz. Domain-inversion poling with push-pull
configuration is applied using alternating pulses on a 2-section
directional-coupler to achieve a spurious free dynamic range of 110dB/Hz2/3.
The 3-dB electrical bandwidth of device is measured to be 10GHz.

homogeneous Universe governed by $f(T)$ gravity. We show how the torsion
contribution to the FRW cosmology can provide a \textit{unique} origin for both
early and late acceleration phases of the Universe. The three models ($k=0, \pm
1$) show a \textit{built-in} inflationary behavior at some early Universe time;
they restore suitable conditions for the hot big bang nucleosynthesis to begin.
Unlike the standard cosmology, we show that even if the Universe initially
started with positive or negative sectional curvatures, the curvature density
parameter enforces evolution to a flat Universe. The solution constrains the
torsion scalar $T$ to be a constant function at all time $t$, for the three
models. This eliminates the need for the dark energy (DE). Moreover, when the
continuity equation is assumed for the torsion fluid, we show that the flat and
closed Universe models \textit{violate} the conservation principle, while the
open one does not. The evolution of the effective equation of state (EoS) of
the torsion fluid implies a peculiar trace from a quintessence-like DE to a
phantom-like one crossing a matter and radiation EoS in between; then it
asymptotically approaches a de Sitter fate.
