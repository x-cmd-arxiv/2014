future space missions is the interaction with cosmic rays. We tested the
sensitivity of Cold Electron Bolometers (CEBs) to ionizing radiation using
gamma-rays from a radioactive source and X-rays from a X-ray tube. We describe
the test setup and the results. As expected, due to the effective thermal
insulation of the sensing element and its negligible volume, we find that CEBs
are largely immune to this problem.

the power-law form of the scalar primordial spectrum is ruled out at more than
$3\sigma$ CL. This is an important finding, since the power-law form of the
scalar primordial spectrum is one of the main assumptions of concordance model
of cosmology and also a direct prediction of many inflationary scenarios. We
show that a break or step in the form of the primordial scalar perturbation
spectrum, similar to what we studied recently analyzing Planck data [4] can
address both Planck and BICEP2 results simultaneously. Our findings also
indicate that the data may require more flexibilities than what running of
scalar spectral index can provide. Finally we show that an inflaton potential,
originally appeared in [5] can generate both the step and the break model of
scalar primordial spectrum in two different limits. The discussed potential is
found to be favored by Planck data but marginally disfavored by BICEP2 results
as it produces slightly lower amplitude of tensor primordial spectrum. Hence,
if the tensor-to-scalar ratio ($r$) quoted by BICEP2 persists, it is of
importance that we generate inflationary models with large $r$ and at the same

environment, extending a theory developed earlier by the authors. The model
considers a system of rational agents interacting in a game theoretical
framework. This evolution drives the dynamic of the agents in both wealth and
economic configuration variables. The cost function is chosen to represent a
risk averse strategy of each agent. That is, the agent is more likely to
interact with the market, the more predictable the market, and therefore the
smaller its individual risk. This yields a kinetic equation for an effective
single particle agent density with a Nash equilibrium serving as the local
thermodynamic equilibrium. We consider a regime of scale separation where the
large scale dynamics is given by a hydrodynamic closure with this local
equilibrium. A class of generalized collision invariants (GCIs) is developed to
overcome the difficulty of the non-conservative property in the hydrodynamic
closure derivation of the large scale dynamics for the evolution of wealth
distribution. The result is a system of gas dynamics-type equations for the
density and average wealth of the agents on large scales. We recover the
inverse Gamma distribution, which has been previously considered in the
literature, as a local equilibrium for particular choices of the cost function.

  Networking (JWCN)",,,,"cs.IT cs.NI math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The time domain inter-cell interference coordination techniques specified in
LTE Rel. 10 standard improves the throughput of picocell-edge users by
protecting them from macrocell interference. On the other hand, it also
degrades the aggregate capacity in macrocell because the macro base station
(MBS) does not transmit data during certain subframes known as almost blank
subframes. The MBS data transmission using reduced power subframes was
standardized in LTE Rel. 11, which can improve the capacity in macrocell while
not causing high interference to the nearby picocells. In order to get maximum
benefit from the reduced power subframes, setting the key system parameters,
such as the amount of power reduction, carries critical importance. Using
stochastic geometry, this paper lays down a theoretical foundation for the
performance evaluation of heterogeneous networks with reduced power subframes
and range expansion bias. The analytic expressions for average capacity and 5th
percentile throughput are derived as a function of transmit powers, node
densities, and interference coordination parameters in a heterogeneous network
scenario, and are validated through Monte Carlo simulations. Joint optimization
of range expansion bias, power reduction factor, scheduling thresholds, and
duty cycle of reduced power subframes are performed to study the trade-offs
between aggregate capacity of a cell and fairness among the users. To validate
our analysis, we also compare the stochastic geometry based theoretical results
with the real MBS deployment (in the city of London) and the hexagonal-grid
model. Our analysis shows that with optimum parameter settings, the LTE Rel. 11
with reduced power subframes can provide substantially better performance than
the LTE Rel. 10 with almost blank subframes, in terms of both aggregate
capacity and fairness.

(NLFFF) extrapolation of a coronal magnetic FR that supports a large-scale
intermediate filament between an active region and a weak polarity region. This
result is the first in that current NLFFF extrapolations with presence of FRs
are limited to relatively small-scale filaments that are close to sunspots and
along main polarity inversion line (PIL) with strong transverse field and
magnetic shear, and the existence of a FR is usually predictable. In contrast,
the present filament lies along the weak-field region (photospheric field
strength $\lesssim 100$ G), where the PIL is very fragmented due to small
parasitic polarities on both side of the PIL and the transverse field has a low
value of signal-to-noise ratio. Thus it represents a far more difficult
challenge to extrapolate a large-scale FR in such case. We demonstrate that our
CESE--MHD--NLFFF code is competent for the challenge. The numerically
reproduced magnetic dips of the extrapolated FR match observations of the
filament and its barbs very well, which supports strongly the FR-dip model for
filaments. The filament is stably sustained because the FR is weakly twisted
and strongly confined by the overlying closed arcades.

and the frictional traction over a tool-workpiece interface using measured
values of force and torque applied to the tool. The approach was developed
specifically for friction stir welding and friction stir processing
applications, but is sufficiently general to be of use in a variety of other
processes that involve sliding contact and heating at a tool-workpiece
interface. The methodology works with a finite element framework that is
intended to predict the evolution of the microstructural state of the workpiece
material as it undergoes a complex thermomechanical history imposed by the
process tooling. We employ a three-dimensional, Eulerian, finite element
formulation; it includes coupling among the solutions for velocity, temperature
and material state evolution. A critical element of the methodology is a
procedure to estimate the tool interface traction and temperature from typical,
measured values of force and torque. The procedure leads naturally to an
intuitive basis for estimating error that is used in conjunction with multiple
meshes to assure convergence. The methodology is demonstrate for a suite of
three experiments that had been previously published as part of a study on the
effect of weld speed on friction stir welding. The probe interface temperatures
and torques are estimated for all three weld speeds and the multi-mesh error
estimation methodology is employed to quantify the rate of convergence.
Finally, comparison of computed and measured power usage is used as a further
validation. Using the converged results, trends in the material flow,
temperature, stress, deformation rate and material state with changing weld
conditions are examined.

inequalities between the four spectral characteristics in question, and provide
the exact large coupling asymptotics of the dimension of the density of states
measure (for the other three quantities, the large coupling asymptotics were
known before).
  A crucial ingredient of the paper is the relation between spectral properties
of the Fibonacci Hamiltonian and dynamical properties of the Fibonacci trace
map (such as dimensional characteristics of the non-wandering hyperbolic set
and its measure of maximal entropy as well as other equilibrium measures,
topological entropy, multipliers of periodic orbits). We establish exact
identities relating the spectral and dynamical quantities, and show the
connection between the spectral quantities and the thermodynamic pressure

Dixon, Duncan and Kissinger that allows the finite representation of certain
infinite families of graphs and graph rewrite rules, and to demonstrate that a
logic can be built on this to allow the formalisation of inductive proofs in
the string diagrams of compact closed and traced symmetric monoidal categories.
  String diagrams provide an intuitive method for reasoning about monoidal
categories. However, this does not negate the ability for those using them to
make mistakes in proofs. To this end, there is a project (Quantomatic) to build
a proof assistant for string diagrams, at least for those based on categories
with a notion of trace. The development of string graphs has provided a
combinatorial formalisation of string diagrams, laying the foundations for this
project.
  The prevalence of commutative Frobenius algebras (CFAs) in quantum
information theory, a major application area of these diagrams, has led to the
use of variable-arity nodes as a shorthand for normalised networks of Frobenius
algebra morphisms, so-called ""spider notation"". This notation greatly eases
reasoning with CFAs, but string graphs are inadequate to properly encode this
reasoning.
  This dissertation extends string graphs to allow for variable-arity nodes to
be represented at all, and then introduces !-box notation (and structures to
encode it) to represent string graph equations containing repeated subgraphs,
where the number of repetitions is abitrary. It then demonstrates how we can
reason directly about !-graphs, viewed as (typically infinite) families of
string graphs. Of particular note is the presentation of a form of graph-based
induction, allowing the formal encoding of proofs that previously could only be
represented as a mix of string diagrams and explanatory text.

near $0$. Specifically, if $F$ near $0$ behaves like a $gamma(a,1)$

number of renewals on the interval $[0,\log(n)/a]$ of a renewal process with

between random partitions, renewal theory and random polytopes. In particular,

$\Delta I_e$. Any variation with local group environment at fixed structure is
only slight: Satellites have the oldest stellar populations, 0.02 dex older

fractal dimension, graph energy and graph spectral distance. The finding of
power-law relationships between rescaled graph energy and fractal dimension for
both unweighted and weighted metro networks indicates the energy costs per unit
area are lower for higher dimensioned metros. In L space, the mean Wasserstein
distance between any pair of connected stations is proportional to the fractal
dimension, which is in the vicinity of our theoretical calculations treated on
special regular tree graphs. This finding reveals the geometry of metro
networks and tree graphs are in close proximity to one another. In P space, the
mean Wasserstein distance between any pair of stations relates closely to the
average number of transfers. By ranking several key quantities transport
concerned, we obtain several ranking lists in which New York metro and Berlin
metro consistently top the first two spots.

solution to provide cost-effective and reliable power supplies for
energy-constrained wireless networks, has drawn growing interests recently. To
overcome the significant propagation loss over distance, employing
multi-antennas at the energy transmitter (ET) to more efficiently direct
wireless energy to desired energy receivers (ERs), termed \emph{energy
beamforming}, is an essential technique for enabling WET. However, the
achievable gain of energy beamforming crucially depends on the available
channel state information (CSI) at the ET, which needs to be acquired
practically. In this paper, we study the design of an efficient channel
acquisition method for a point-to-point multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)
WET system by exploiting the channel reciprocity, i.e., the ET estimates the
CSI via dedicated reverse-link training from the ER. Considering the limited
energy availability at the ER, the training strategy should be carefully
designed so that the channel can be estimated with sufficient accuracy, and yet
without consuming excessive energy at the ER. To this end, we propose to
maximize the \emph{net} harvested energy at the ER, which is the average
harvested energy offset by that used for channel training. An optimization
problem is formulated for the training design over MIMO Rician fading channels,
including the subset of ER antennas to be trained, as well as the training time
and power allocated. Closed-form solutions are obtained for some special
scenarios, based on which useful insights are drawn on when training should be
employed to improve the net transferred energy in MIMO WET systems.

there may exist in the presence of different orbitals a special state with

effectively decoupled and may give e.g. long-range magnetic order or stay
paramagnetic. Similar situation can be realized in dimers spontaneously formed
at structural phase transitions, which can be called orbital-selective Peierls
transition. This can occur in case of strongly nonuniform hopping integrals for
different orbitals and small intra-atomic Hund's rule coupling JH. Yet another
consequence of this picture is that for odd number of electrons per dimer there
exist competition between double exchange mechanism of ferromagnetism, and the
formation of singlet dimer by electron on one orbital, with remaining electrons
giving a net spin of a dimer. The first case is realized for strong Hund's rule
coupling, typical for 3d compounds, whereas the second is more plausible for
4d-5d compounds. We discuss some implications of these phenomena, and consider
examples of real systems, in which orbital-selective phase seems to be

foreground galaxies, since different type progenitors result in different
redshift distributions of FRBs. For example, the redshift distribution of FRBs
arising from double stars shifts toward lower redshift than of the FRBs arising
from single stars, because double stars and single stars have different
evolution timescales. With detailed calculations, we predict that the FRB
sample size for producing one lensing event varies significantly for different

different FRB models and also discuss the practical possibility of using

first, we investigate the discrete memoryless MARC-WT. Three inner bounds (with
respect to decode-forward (DF), noise-forward (NF) and compress-forward (CF)
strategies) on the secrecy capacity region are provided. Second, we investigate
the degraded discrete memoryless MARC-WT, and present an outer bound on the
secrecy capacity region of this degraded model. Finally, we investigate the
Gaussian MARC-WT, and find that the NF and CF strategies help to enhance
Tekin-Yener's achievable secrecy rate region of Gaussian MAC-WT. Moreover, we
find that if the noise variance of the transmitters-relay channel is smaller
than that of the transmitters-receiver channel, the DF strategy may also
enhance Tekin-Yener's achievable secrecy rate region of Gaussian MAC-WT, and it
may perform even better than the NF and CF strategies.

high-dimensional data set with redundant noise features, has been attracted
more and more interests in recent years. The existing studies commonly solve
the problem in a framework of maximizing the weighted feature contributions
subject to a $\ell_2/\ell_1$ penalty. Nevertheless, this framework has two
serious drawbacks: One is that the solution of the framework unavoidably
involves a considerable portion of redundant noise features in many situations,
and the other is that the framework neither offers intuitive explanations on
why this framework can select relevant features nor leads to any theoretical
guarantee for feature selection consistency.
  In this article, we attempt to overcome those drawbacks through developing a
new sparse clustering framework which uses a $\ell_{\infty}/\ell_0$ penalty.
First, we introduce new concepts on optimal partitions and noise features for
the high-dimensional data clustering problems, based on which the previously
known framework can be intuitively explained in principle. Then, we apply the
suggested $\ell_{\infty}/\ell_0$ framework to formulate a new sparse k-means
model with the $\ell_{\infty}/\ell_0$ penalty ($\ell_0$-k-means for short). We
propose an efficient iterative algorithm for solving the $\ell_0$-k-means. To
deeply understand the behavior of $\ell_0$-k-means, we prove that the solution
yielded by the $\ell_0$-k-means algorithm has feature selection consistency
whenever the data matrix is generated from a high-dimensional Gaussian mixture
model. Finally, we provide experiments with both synthetic data and the Allen
Developing Mouse Brain Atlas data to support that the proposed $\ell_0$-k-means
exhibits better noise feature detection capacity over the previously known
sparse k-means with the $\ell_2/\ell_1$ penalty ($\ell_1$-k-means for short).

models. The column densities of ArH$^+$ are compared to those of other species,
tracing interstellar medium (ISM) components with different H$_2$ abundances.
Chemical models are constructed, taking UV radiation and cosmic ray ionization
into account. Due to the detection of two isotopologues, $^{36}$ArH$^+$ and
$^{38}$ArH$^+$, we are confident about the carrier assignment to ArH$^+$.
NeH$^+$ is not detected with a limit of [NeH$^+$]/[ArH$^+$] $\le$ 0.1. The
derived column densities agree well with the predictions of chemical models.
ArH$^+$ is a unique tracer of gas with a fractional H$_2$ abundance of
$10^{-4}- 10^{-3}$ and shows little correlation with H$_2$O$^+$, which traces
gas with a fractional H$_2$ abundance of $\approx $0.1. A careful analysis of
variations in the ArH$^+$, OH$^+$, H$_2$O$^+$ and HF column densities promises
to be a faithful tracer of the distribution of the H$_2$ fractional abundance,
providing unique information on a poorly known phase in the cycle of
interstellar matter, its transition from atomic diffuse gas to dense molecular
gas traced by CO emission. Abundances of these species put strong observational
constraints upon magnetohydrodynamical (MHD) simulations of the interstellar
medium, and potentially could evolve into a tool to characterize the ISM.
Paradoxically, the ArH$^+$ molecule is a better tracer of \new{almost} purely

half-space subjected to a concentrated normal quasi-static load is studied
within the framework of linear dipolar gradient elasticity. Our main concern is
to determine possible deviations from the predictions of classical linear
elastostatics when a more refined theory is employed to attack the problem. Of
special importance is the behavior of the new solution near to the point of
application of the load where pathological singularities exist in the classical
solution. The use of the theory of gradient elasticity is intended here to
model the response of materials with microstructure in a manner that the
classical theory cannot afford. A linear version of this theory results by
considering a linear isotropic expression for the strain-energy density that
depends on strain-gradient terms, in addition to the standard strain terms
appearing in classical elasticity. Through this formulation, a microstructural
material constant is introduced, in addition to the standard Lam\'e constants.
The solution method is based on integral transforms and is exact. The present
results show significant departure from the predictions of classical
elasticity. Indeed, continuous and bounded displacements are predicted at the
points of application of the concentrated load. Such a behavior of the
displacement field is, of course, more natural than the singular behavior
exhibited in the classical solution.

recall the notions of the source and target maps $\varepsilon_s$ and
$\varepsilon_t$, as well as of the source and target algebras. Then we
investigate these objects further. Among other things, we show that the
canonical idempotent $E$ (which is eventually $\Delta(1)$) belongs to the
multiplier algebra $M(B\otimes C)$ where $B=\varepsilon_s(A)$ and
$C=\varepsilon_t(A)$ and that it is a separability idempotent.
  We also consider special cases and examples in this paper. In particular, we
see how for any weak multiplier Hopf algebra, it is possible to make $C\otimes
B$ (with $B$ and $C$ as above) into a new weak multiplier Hopf algebra. In a
sense, it forgets the 'Hopf algebra part' of the original weak multiplier Hopf
algebra and only remembers the source and target algebras. It is in turn
generalized to the case of any pair of non-degenerate algebras $B$ and $C$ with
a separability idempotent $E\in M(B\otimes C)$. We get another example using
this theory associated to any discrete quantum group (a multiplier Hopf algebra
of discrete type with a normalized cointegral). Finally we also consider the
well-known 'quantization' of the groupoid that comes from an action of a group
on a set. All these constructions provide interesting new examples of weak
multiplier Hopf algebras (that are not weak Hopf algebras).

lacunar pores (micro-cracks) inside an intra-aggregate clay that change in
volume during shrinkage. Then, through a series of consecutive steps,

measures used in psychology studies and motivated from an ecological approach.
The selected perceptual features were rated in two listening experiments using
two different data sets. They were modeled both from symbolic (MIDI) and audio
data using different sets of computational features. Ratings of emotional
expression were predicted using the perceptual features. The results indicate
that (1) at least some of the perceptual features are reliable estimates; (2)
emotion ratings could be predicted by a small combination of perceptual
features with an explained variance up to 90%; (3) the perceptual features
could only to a limited extent be modeled using existing audio features. The
results also clearly indicated that a small number of dedicated features were

cubes suggests that most of them are associated with the Sh2-90 region. 129
YSOs are identified (Class I, Class II, and near-IR excess sources). The
majority of the YSOs are low mass (<= 3 Msun) sources and they are distributed
mostly in the regions of high column density. Four candidate Class 0/I MYSOs
have been found; they will possibly evolve to stars of mass >= 15 Msun. We
suggest multi-generation star formation is present in the complex. From the
evidences of interaction, the time scales involved and the evolutionary status
of stellar/protostellar sources, we argue that the star formation at the
immediate border/edges of Sh2-90 might have been triggered by the expanding HII

particles. In this paper some of such models have been implemented in a
DEM-framework, and simulation results were compared to experimental
measurements. Also, the influence of capillary model type on macro parameters
like local shear viscosity and cohesive parameters of sheared material have
been investigated through the simulation of spherical beads using a DEM-model
of a split-bottom shear-cell. It was concluded that the water content,
simulated with the help of capillary bridge models, changes the
macro-properties of the simulated granular material. Different capillary bridge
models do not influence the macroscopic results visibly.

the exact exterior solution in CWG for a static, spherically symmetric source
provides a linear potential $\gamma r$, which can explain the observed galactic
rotation curves with a value for $\gamma$ given by $\sim + 10^{-26}
\mathrm{m}^{-1}$. Previous work has also shown that CWG can explain lensing
observations, but with $\gamma\sim - 10^{-26} \mathrm{m}^{-1}$ in order to
ensure converging rays of light rather than diverging ones. Even though
different expressions for the angle of deflection have been derived in CWG in

to fit the lensing data is several orders of magnitude higher than that
required to fit the galactic rotation curves.

  Results. The estimated 4sigma detection limits within an 1"" aperture radius
are 26.7, 25.9, 25.1, and 24.1 mag [AB] for g', r', i', and z'-bands and 23.4,

0.013"" with a root mean square offset of 0.32"". We distinguish 5441 secure
stars from extended sources using u*-J vs. g'-Ks colors, combined with the
SExtractor stellarity index of the images. Comparing with galaxy spectroscopic
redshifts, we find a photometric redshift dispersion, sigma_(dz/(1+z)), of
0.032 and catastrophic failure rate, dz/(1+z)>0.15, of 5.8% at z<1, while a
dispersion of 0.117 and a catastrophic failures rate of 16.6% at z>1. We extend
estimate of the zp uncertainty over the full magnitude/redshift space with a
redshift probability distribution function and find that our redshift are
highly accurate with z'<22 at zp<2.5 and for fainter sources with z'<24 at z<1.
From the investigation of photometric properties of AKARI infrared sources
(23354 sources) using the g'z'Ks diagram, <5% of AKARI sources with optical
counterparts are classified as high-z (1.4<z<2.5) star-forming galaxies. Among

potentials give rise to ill-posed formal semiclassical limits. These problems
have attracted a lot of attention in the last few years, as a proxy for the
treatment of eigenvalue crossings, i.e. general systems. It has recently been
shown that the semiclassical limit for conical singularities is in fact
well-posed, as long as the Wigner measure (WM) stays away from singular saddle
points. In this work we develop a family of refined semiclassical estimates,
and use them to derive regularized transport equations for saddle points with
infinite Lyapunov exponents, extending the aforementioned recent results. In
the process we answer a related question posed by P. L. Lions and T. Paul in
1993. If we consider more singular potentials, our rigorous estimates break
down. To investigate whether conical saddle points, such as $-|x|$, admit a
regularized transport asymptotic approximation, we employ a numerical solver
based on posteriori error control. Thus rigorous upper bounds for the
asymptotic error in concrete problems are generated. In particular, specific
phenomena which render invalid any regularized transport for $-|x|$ are
identified and quantified. In that sense our rigorous results are sharp.
Finally, we use our findings to formulate a precise conjecture for the
condition under which conical saddle points admit a regularized transport
solution for the WM.

biological network analysis. Given two input graphs $G_1=(V_1,E_1),
G_2=(V_2,E_2)$, a pair of vertex mappings induces an {\it edge conservation} if
the vertex pairs are adjacent in their respective graphs. %In general terms The
goal is to provide a one-to-one mapping between the vertices of the input
graphs in order to maximize edge conservation. However the allowed mappings are
restricted since each vertex from $V_1$ (resp. $V_2$) is allowed to be mapped
to at most $m_1$ (resp. $m_2$) specified vertices in $V_2$ (resp. $V_1$). Most
of results in this paper deal with the case $m_2=1$ which attracted most
attention in the related literature. We formulate the problem as a maximum
independent set problem in a related {\em conflict graph} and investigate
structural properties of this graph in terms of forbidden subgraphs. We are
interested, in particular, in excluding certain wheals, fans, cliques or claws
(all terms are defined in the paper), which corresponds in excluding certain
cycles, paths, cliques or independent sets in the neighborhood of each vertex.
Then, we investigate algorithmic consequences of some of these properties,
which illustrates the potential of this approach and raises new horizons for
further works. In particular this approach allows us to reinterpret a known
polynomial case in terms of conflict graph and to improve known approximation
and fixed-parameter tractability results through efficiently solving the
maximum independent set problem in conflict graphs. Some of our new
approximation results involve approximation ratios that are function of the
optimal value, in particular its square root; this kind of results cannot be
achieved for maximum independent set in general graphs.

in bins of stellar mass and redshift. Gas masses have been inferred from the
dust masses, obtained by stacked Herschel far-IR and sub-mm data in the GOODS

relations for the dust-to-gas ratio. We find that AGNs are on average hosted in
galaxies much more gas rich than inactive galaxies. In the vast majority of
stellar mass bins, the average gas content of AGN hosts is higher than in
inactive galaxies. The difference is up to a factor of ten higher in low
stellar mass galaxies, with a significance of 6.5$\sigma$. In almost half of
the AGN sample the gas content is three times higher than in the control sample
of inactive galaxies. Our result strongly suggests that the probability of
having an AGN activated is simply driven by the amount of gas in the host
galaxy; this can be explained in simple terms of statistical probability of
having a gas cloud falling into the gravitational potential of the black hole.
The increased probability of an AGN being hosted by a star-forming galaxy,
identified by previous works, may be a consequence of the relationship between
gas content and AGN activity, found in this paper, combined with the
Schmidt-Kennicutt law for star formation.

hubs monopolize the connections, while most other nodes are sparsely connected.

measurements in the He I 1083.0 nm triplet obtained with the Tenerife Infrared
Polarimeter installed at the German Vacuum Tower Telescope of the Observatorio
del Teide. Methods. The He I 1083.0 nm triplet Stokes profiles are analyzed
with an inversion code that takes into account the physics responsible of the
polarization signals in this triplet. The results are put into a solar context
with the help of extreme ultraviolet observations taken with the Solar Dynamic
Observatory and the Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory satellites.
Results: For the most probable magnetic field vector configuration, the
analysis depicts a mean field strength of 7 gauss. We do not find local
variations in the field strength except that the field is, in average, lower in
the prominence body than in the prominence feet, where the field strength
reaches 25 gauss. The averaged magnetic field inclination with respect to the
local vertical is 77 degrees. The acute angle of the magnetic field vector with
the prominence main axis is 24 degrees for the sinistral chirality case and 58
degrees for the dextral chirality. These inferences are in rough agreement with
previous results obtained from the analysis of data acquired with lower spatial

unrelated to the original function, thus it is always preferable. On the other
hand, it is usually easier to construct constrained ppf's with as little

critical layer in this regime is essential for creating low-$\beta$ traveling
acceleration structures of sufficient laser-excited potential for laser ion
accelerators (LIA). In Relativistically Induced Transparency Acceleration
(RITA) scheme the heavy plasma-ions are fixed and only trace-density light-ions
are accelerated. The relativistic critical layer and the acceleration structure
move longitudinally forward by laser inducing transparency through apparent
relativistic increase in electron mass. In the Radiation Pressure Acceleration
(RPA) scheme the whole plasma is longitudinally pushed forward under the action
of the laser radiation pressure, possible only when plasma ions co-propagate
with the laser front. In RPA the acceleration structure velocity critically
depends upon plasma-ion mass in addition to the laser intensity and plasma
density. In RITA, mass of the heavy immobile plasma-ions does not affect the
speed of the critical layer. Inertia of the bared immobile ions in RITA excites
the charge separation potential whereas RPA is not possible when ions are

$\order{20-30\%}$ expected at freezeout for most scenarios. Moreover, the
deviation from boost-invariance is correlated with both transverse flow and
elliptic flow, with the more highly transversely flowing regions also showing
the most violation of boost invariance. Therefore, if longitudinal flow is not
fully developed at the early stages of heavy ion collisions, hydrodynamics
where boost-invariance holds at mid-rapidity is inadequate to extract transport
coefficients of the quark-gluon plasma. We conclude by arguing that developing
experimental probes of boost invariance is necessary, and suggest some
promising directions in this regard.

(SMGs) in the GN20 proto-cluster at $z=4.05$ using new IRAM Plateau de Bure
interferometer (PdBI) CO(4-3) and 1.2-3.3 mm continuum observations. All these
three SMGs are heavily dust obscured, with UV-based star formation rate (SFR)
estimates significantly smaller than the ones derived from the bolometric
infrared (IR), consistent with the spatial offsets revealed by HST and CO
imaging. Based also on evaluations of the specific SFR, CO-to-H$_2$ conversion
factor and gas depletion timescale, we classify all the three galaxies as
starbursts (SBs), although with a lower confidence for GN20.2b that might be a
later stage merging event. We place our measurements in the context of the
evolutionary properties of main sequence (MS) and SB galaxies. ULIRGs have 3-5
times larger $L'_{\rm CO}/M_{\rm dust}$ and $M_{\rm dust}/M_\star$ ratios than
$z=0$ MS galaxies, but by $z\sim2$ the difference appears to be blurred,
probably due to differential metallicity evolution. SB galaxies appear to
slowly evolve in their $L'_{\rm CO}/M_{\rm dust}$ and $M_{\rm dust}/M_\star$
ratios all the way to $z>6$ (consistent with rapid enrichment of SB events),
while MS galaxies rapidly increase in $M_{\rm dust}/M_\star$ from $z=0$ to 2
(due to gas fraction increase, compensated by a decrease of metallicities).
While no IR/submm continuum detection is available for indisputably normal
massive galaxies at $z>2.5$, we show that if metallicity indeed decrease
rapidly for these systems at $z>3$ as claimed in the literature, we should
expect a strong decrease of their $M_{\rm dust}/M_\star$, consistent with
recent PdBI and ALMA upper limits. We conclude that the $M_{\rm dust}/M_\star$
ratio could be a powerful tool for distinguishing starbursts from normal
galaxies at $z>4$.

inferred using a variational method enabling efficient probabilistic inference
in terms of computationally tractable model components: Segmenting a full 3-D

using global shape regularization: We segmented 35 fovea-centered 3-D volumes

undetermined parameters of the model. The EoS turns out to be relatively
independent on the entropy per baryon but there are significant changes when
going from the two-flavor to the three-flavor case due to the nontrivial
contribution from the strange quarks which stay massive even at high densities.
While an increasing vector meson coupling constant leads to a substantial
stiffening of the EoS, we find that the impact of changing the scalar meson
mass is equally strong and results in a softening of the EoS for increasing
values.

  synchronization","5 pages,4 figures",,,,"nlin.AO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Collective behaviors of coupled oscillators have attracted much attention. In
this Letter, we propose an ensemble order parameter(EOP) equation that enables
us to grasp the essential low-dimensional dynamical mechanism of the explosive
synchronization in heterogeneous networks. Dif- ferent solutions of the EOP
equation build correspondences with diverse collective states, and different
bifurcations reveal various transitions among these collective states. The
structural relationship between the incoherent state and synchronous state
leads to different routes of transitions to synchronization, either continuous
or discontinuous. The explosive synchronization is determined by the bistable
state where the measure of each state and the critical points are obtained
analytically by using the EOP equation. Our method and results hold for
heterogeneous networks with star graph motifs such as scale-free networks, and
hence, provide an effective approach in understanding the routes to
synchronization in more general complex networks.

voltage applied on a QPC at low temperatures the resulting regular step-like
electron conductance quantization can show an additional kink near pinch-off
around 0.7(2$e^2$/h), called 0.7-anomaly. In a recent publication, we presented
a combination of theoretical calculations and transport measurements that lead
to a detailed understanding of the microscopic origin of the 0.7-anomaly.
Functional Renormalization Group-based calculations were performed exhibiting
the 0.7-anomaly even when no symmetry-breaking external magnetic fields are
involved. According to the calculations the electron spin susceptibility is
enhanced within a QPC that is tuned in the region of the 0.7-anomaly. Moderate
externally applied magnetic fields impose a corresponding enhancement in the
spin magnetization. In principle, it should be possible to map out this spin
distribution optically by means of the Faraday rotation technique. Here we
report the initial steps of an experimental project aimed at realizing such
measurements. Simulations were performed on a particularly pre-designed
semiconductor heterostructure. Based on the simulation results a sample was
built and its basic transport and optical properties were investigated.
Finally, we introduce a sample gate design, suitable for combined transport and
optical studies.

scheduling in such a multithreaded multiprogramming environment is a
significant challenge. In task scheduling, not only the order of the execution,
but also the mapping of threads to the execution resources is of a great

discussed. One is Raman process induced coupling between spin and motion along
one of the spatial directions, and the other is Rashba SO coupling. We
emphasize their common features in both single-particle and two-body physics
and their consequences in many-body physics. For instance, single particle
ground state degeneracy leads to novel features of superfluidity and richer
phase diagram; increased low-energy density-of-state enhances interaction
effects; the absence of Galilean invariance and spin-momentum locking give rise
to intriguing behaviors of superfluid critical velocity and novel quantum
dynamics; and mixing of two-body singlet and triplet states yields novel
fermion pairing structure and topological superfluids. With these examples, we
show that investigating SO coupling in cold atom systems can enrich our
understanding of basic phenomena such as superfluidity, provide a good platform
for simulating condensed matter states such as topological superfluids, and
more importantly, result in novel quantum systems such as SO coupled unitary
Fermi gas or high spin quantum gases. Finally we also point out major

applied to Hipparcos data for the Pleiades and the Hyades. The method is
applied in the context of the historic Pleiades distance problem, with a
discussion of previous criticisms of Hipparcos parallaxes. This is followed by
an outlook for Gaia, where the improved method could be especially useful.
Based on maximum likelihood estimation, the method combines parallax, position,
apparent magnitude, colour, proper motion, and radial velocity information to
estimate the parameters describing an open cluster precisely and without bias.
We find the distance to the Pleiades to be $120.3 \pm 1.5$ pc, in accordance
with previously published work using the same dataset. We find that error
correlations cannot be responsible for the still present discrepancy between
Hipparcos and photometric methods. Additionally, the three-dimensional space
velocity and physical structure of Pleiades is parametrised, where we find
strong evidence of mass segregation. The distance to the Hyades is found to be
$46.35\pm 0.35$ pc, also in accordance with previous results. Through the use
of simulations, we confirm that the method is unbiased, so will be useful for
accurate open cluster parameter estimation with Gaia at distances up to several

spatial dispersal. However, if backward bifurcations can occur in the regions,

social network of 74 college students. We present a multiplex network approach
to social tie strength, here applied to mobile communication data - calls, text
messages, and co-location, allowing us to dimensionally identify relationships
by considering the number of communication channels utilized between students.
We find that strong social ties are characterized by maximal use of
communication channels, while weak ties by minimal use. We are able to identify
75% of close friendships, 90% of weaker ties, and 90% of Facebook friendships
as compared to reported ground truth. We then show that stronger ties exhibit
greater profile similarity than weaker ones. Apart from high homogeneity in
social circles with respect to political and health aspects, we observe strong
homophily driven by music, residential sector and year in college. Despite
Facebook friendship being highly dependent on residence and year, exposure to
less homogeneous content can be found in the online rather than the offline
social circles of students, most notably in political and music aspects.

ratio between the product of mixed noises and the product of charge and heat
noises, distinguishing between the auto-ratio defined in the same reservoir and
the cross-ratio between distinct reservoirs. From the linear response regime to
the high-voltage regime, we further specify the analytical expressions of
differential conductances, noises and ratios of noises, and examine their
behavior in two concrete nanosystems: a quantum point contact in an ohmic
environment and a single energy level quantum dot connected to reservoirs. In
the linear response regime, we find that these ratios are equal to each other
and are simply related to the figure of merit. They can be expressed in terms
of differential conductances with the help of the fluctuation-dissipation
theorem. In the non-linear regime, these ratios radically distinguish between
themselves as the auto-ratio remains bounded by one, while the cross-ratio
exhibits rich and complex behaviors. In the quantum dot nanosystem, we moreover
demonstrate that the thermoelectric efficiency can be expressed as a ratio of
noises in the non-linear Schottky regime. In the intermediate voltage regime,
the cross-ratio changes sign and diverges, which evidences a change of sign in
the heat cross-noise.

and/or video signals) typically transmit with fixed data rates, but may
occasionally suffer from transmission outages caused by the random nature of
the fading channels. If the transmitter has instantaneous channel state
information (CSI) available, it can compensate for a significant portion of
these outages by utilizing power allocation. In this paper, we consider optimal
power allocation for a conventional dual-hop bidirectional decode-and-forward
(DF) relaying system with a three-phase transmission protocol. The proposed
strategy minimizes the average power consumed by the end nodes and the relay,
subject to some maximum allowable system outage probability (OP), or
equivalently, minimizes the system OP while meeting average power constraints
at the end nodes and the relay. We show that in the proposed power allocation
scheme, the end nodes and the relay adjust their output powers to the minimum
level required to avoid outages, but will sometimes be silent, in order to
conserve power and prolong their lifetimes. For the proposed scheme, the end
nodes use the instantaneous CSI of their respective source-relay links and the
relay uses the instantaneous CSI of both links.

prevent the application of quantum error correction protocols and thus preclude

measured cross-talk is on the order of $10^{-5}$ and therefore below the

overcome with respect to cross-talk.

  references added",,,,"hep-ph hep-th","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In the minimal composite Higgs model (MCHM), the size of the Higgs mass and
vacuum expectation value is determined, via the Higgs potential, by the size of
operators that violate the global SO(5) symmetry. In 5D holographic
realisations of this model, this translates into the inclusion of brane
localised operators. However, the inclusion of all such operators results in a
large and under-constrained parameter space. In this paper we study the level
of fine-tuning involved in such a parameter space, focusing on the MCHM${}_5$.
It is demonstrated that the gauge contribution to the Higgs potential can be
suppressed by brane localised kinetic terms, but this is correlated with an
enhancement to the S parameter. The fermion contribution, on the other hand,
can be enhanced or suppressed. However this does not significantly improve the
level of fine tunings, since the Higgs squared term, in the potential, requires
a cancellation between the fermion and gauge contributions. Although we focus
on the MCHM${}_5$, the fermion holographic Lagrangian - including all possible
brane localised mass and kinetic terms - is derived in the appendix and will
have applications to a wider range of composite Higgs models.

large inflationary tensor-to-scalar ratio r_{0.05}=0.2^{+0.07}_{-0.05}, we
re-examine the evidence for an extra sterile massive neutrino, originally
invoked to account for the tension between the cosmic microwave background
(CMB) temperature power spectrum and local measurements of the expansion rate
H0 and cosmological structure. With only the standard active neutrinos and
power-law scalar spectra, this detection is in tension with the upper limit of
r<0.11 (95% confidence) from the lack of a corresponding low multipole excess
in the temperature anisotropy from gravitational waves. An extra sterile
species with the same energy density as is needed to reconcile the CMB data
with H0 measurements can also alleviate this new tension. By combining data
from the Planck and ACT/SPT temperature spectra, WMAP9 polarization, H_0,
baryon acoustic oscillation and local cluster abundance measurements with
BICEP2 data, we find the joint evidence for a sterile massive neutrino
increases to DeltaNeff=0.98\pm 0.26 for the effective number and ms= 0.52\pm
0.13 eV for the effective mass or 3.8 sigma and 4 sigma evidence respectively.
We caution the reader that these results correspond to a joint statistical
evidence and, in addition, astrophysical systematic errors in the clusters and

tension between the recent BICEP2 data and the Planck data, we will here
explore the consequences of a large running in the spectral index as suggested
by the BICEP2 collaboration as an alternative explanation of the apparent
tension, but which would be in conflict with prediction of the simplest model
of chaotic inflation. The large field chaotic model is sensitive to UV physics,
and the nontrivial running of the spectral index suggested by the BICEP2
collaboration could therefore, if true, be telling us some additional new
information about the UV completion of inflation. However, before we would be
able to draw such strong conclusions with confidence, we would first have to
also carefully exclude all the alternatives. Assuming monomial chaotic
inflation is the right theory of inflation, we therefore explore the
possibility that the running could be due to some other less UV sensitive
degree of freedom. As an example, we ask if it is possible that the curvature
perturbation spectrum has a contribution from a curvaton, which makes up for
the large running in the spectrum. We find that this effect could mask the
information we can extract about the UV physics. We also study different
different models, which might lead to a large negative intrinsic running of the
curvaton.

forces (by ions). In this study we show that drag or friction forces in the
ionosphere-thermosphere system initiate changes in the plasma flow, neutral
wind, and the conductivity, as well. Ions and electrons embedded in neutral
wind field of velocity u acquire drifts perpendicular both to the initial
neutral wind velocity and to the ambient magnetic field producing a
perpendicular electric current. This perpendicular electric current is defined
by a conductivity derived previously and the polarization electric field u x B.
Self-consistently, the free neutrals acquires an additional neutral velocity
component perpendicular to the initial neutral wind velocity u. The Pedersen
and Hall currents wane within a specific time inversely proportional to
neutral-ion collision frequency. These findings are relevant to a better
understanding of electric current generation, distribution and closure in
weakly ionized plasmas where charged particles (plasma) and neutrals are not
bound (free) as the ionosphere and thermosphere in the Earth environment, the
solar atmosphere-chromosphere region and even dusty plasmas. The theoretical
results supposedly address to recent observations of meso-scale neutral wind

pressure to the energy drain at both the network and the end user. Energy
efficient video transmission techniques are thus imperative to cope with the
challenge of satisfying user demand at sustainable costs. In this paper, we
investigate how predicted user rates can be exploited for energy efficient
video streaming with the popular HTTP-based Adaptive Streaming (AS) protocols
(e.g. DASH). To this end, we develop an energy-efficient Predictive Green
Streaming (PGS) optimization framework that leverages predictions of wireless
data rates to achieve the following objectives 1) minimize the required
transmission airtime without causing streaming interruptions, 2) minimize total
downlink Base Station (BS) power consumption for cases where BSs can be
switched off in deep sleep, and 3) enable a trade-off between AS quality and
energy consumption. Our framework is first formulated as a Mixed Integer Linear
Program (MILP) where decisions on multi-user rate allocation, video segment
quality, and BS transmit power are jointly optimized. Then, to provide an
online solution, we present a polynomial-time heuristic algorithm that
decouples the PGS problem into multiple stages. We provide a performance
analysis of the proposed methods by simulations, and numerical results
demonstrate that the PGS framework yields significant energy savings.

We consider the two and three $\alpha$-particle systems and focus on the lowest
states with non-zero angular momentum which split into multiplets corresponding
to different irreducible representations of the cubic group. We examine the
dependence of such splittings on the lattice spacing and box size. We find that
lattice spacing errors are closely related to the commensurability of the
lattice with the intrinsic length scales of the system. We also show that
rotational symmetry breaking effects can be significantly reduced by using
improved lattice actions, and that the physical energy levels are accurately
reproduced by the weighted average of a given spin multiplets.

and between cells. This variability, as well as having dramatic functional
consequences, provides information about the underlying details of the system's
behaviour. It is often desirable to infer properties of the parameters
governing such systems given experimental observations of the mean and variance
of observed quantities. In some circumstances, analytic forms for the
likelihood of these observations allow very efficient inference: we present
these forms and demonstrate their usage. When likelihood functions are
unavailable or difficult to calculate, we show that an implementation of
approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) is a powerful tool for parametric
inference in these systems. However, the calculations required to apply ABC to
these systems can also be computationally expensive, relying on repeated
stochastic simulations. We propose an ABC approach that cheaply eliminates
unimportant regions of parameter space, by addressing computationally simple
mean behaviour before explicitly simulating the more computationally demanding
variance behaviour. We show that this approach leads to a substantial increase
in speed when applied to synthetic and experimental datasets.

of bounded semialgebraic functions. In this work we compute the size of the
fibers of the spectral maps ${\rm Spec}({\tt j})_1:{\rm Spec}({\mathcal

Spec}({\mathcal S}^*(N))\to{\rm Spec}({\mathcal S}^*(M))$ induced by the
inclusion ${\tt j}:N\hookrightarrow M$ of a semialgebraic subset $N$ of $M$.
The ring ${\mathcal S}(M)$ can be understood as the localization of ${\mathcal

semialgebraic functions on $M$ with empty zero set. This provides a natural
inclusion ${\mathfrak i}_M:{\rm Spec}({\mathcal S}(M))\hookrightarrow{\rm

the fibers of the spectral map ${\rm Spec}({\tt j})_2:{\rm Spec}({\mathcal

${\rm Spec}({\tt j})_2|:{\rm Spec}({\mathcal S}^*(N))\setminus{\rm Spec}({\tt

Our problem concentrates on the computation of the size of the fibers of ${\rm

`close' to the complement $Y:=M\setminus N$ provides valuable information
concerning how $N$ is immersed inside $M$. If $N$ is dense in $M$, the map
${\rm Spec}({\tt j})_2$ is surjective and the generic fiber of a prime ideal
${\mathfrak p}\in Z$ contains infinitely many elements. However, finite fibers
may also appear and we provide a criterium to decide when the fiber ${\rm

on the observation that data center multicast traffic has strong heterogeneity.
We propose to remove the multicast management logic from switches and use the
SDN controller to manage multicast groups. The proposed Dual-structure
Multicast (DuSM) determines elephant and mice groups according to their traffic
amounts and treats them separately. For each elephant group, the controller
installs multicast state to maintain multiple shared trees and the group
traffic will be balanced evenly among the trees to avoid congestion. For mice
groups, the controller applies state-free mutlicast that trades bandwidth
capacity for state capacity, such as multicast-to-unicast translation. Our
experiments using real multicast traffic data show that the number of groups
DuSM supports can be 300% of that of IP multicast. DuSM also achieves traffic
balance among links.

The analysis of the city size distribution for all cities on the globe confirms
Zipf's law. Moreover, by investigating the percolation properties of the
clustering of urban areas we assess the closeness to criticality for various
countries. At the critical thresholds, the urban land cover of the countries
undergoes a transition from separated clusters to a gigantic component on the
country scale. We study the Zipf-exponents as a function of the closeness to
percolation and find a systematic decrease with increasing scale, which could
be the reason for deviating exponents reported in literature. Moreover, we
investigate the average size of the clusters as a function of the proximity to
percolation and find country specific behavior. By relating the standard
deviation and the average of cluster sizes -- analogous to Taylor's law -- we
suggest an alternative way to identify the percolation transition. We calculate
spatial correlations of the urban land cover and find long-range correlations.
Finally, by relating the areas of cities with population figures we address the
global aspect of the allometry of cities, finding an exponent $\delta\approx

using a goodness-of-fit criterion based on the chi-square-test. Taking the
fitted parameters non-rejected by the chi-square-test, substituting them into
the model and computing their outputs, we build 95% confidence intervals in
each time instant capturing uncertainty of the survey data (probabilistic
estimation). Using the same set of obtained model parameters, we also provide a
prediction over the next few years with 95% confidence intervals (probabilistic
prediction). This technique is applied to a dynamic social model describing the
evolution of the attitude of the Basque Country population towards the
revolutionary organization ETA.

  method, physical interpretation, and examples","11 pages, 3 Postscript figures",,,,"quant-ph math-ph math.MP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A method to build various integrable models for description of coherent
excitation of multilevel media by laser pulses is suggested. Distribution
functions over the energy levels of quantum systems depending on the time and
frequency detuning are obtained. The distributions follow from Schr\""odinger
equation exact solutions and give the complete dynamical description of
laser-excited quantum multilevel systems. Interpretation based on the Fourier
spectra of the probability amplitudes of a quantum system is presented. The
spectra are expressed in terms of orthonormal polynomials and their weight
functions. Matrix elements of the dipole transitions between levels are equal
to coefficients of the recurrence formula for the orthonormal polynomial
system. Some examples are presented. The Kravchuk oscillator family as an
integrable model is constructed to describe the coherent excitation dynamics of
multilevel resonance media. It is based on the use of the Kravchuk orthogonal
polynomials. The Kravchuk oscillator excitation dynamics is described by the
binomial distribution of energy level populations and the distribution
parameter depends on excitation conditions. Two known basic models in quantum
physics -- the harmonic oscillator and two-level system are the special
representatives of the Kravchuk oscillator family.

  Dual-Hop Transmission Systems",,,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this work, we carry out a unified performance analysis of a dual-hop fixed
gain relay system over asymmetric links composed of both radio-frequency (RF)
and unified free-space optics (FSO) under the effect of pointing errors. The RF
link is modeled by the Nakagami-$m$ fading channel and the FSO link by the
Gamma-Gamma fading channel subject to both types of detection techniques (i.e.
heterodyne detection and intensity modulation with direct detection (IM/DD)).
In particular, we derive new unified closed-form expressions for the cumulative
distribution function, the probability density function, the moment generation
function, and the moments of the end-to-end signal-to-noise ratio of these
systems in terms of the Meijer's G function. Based on these formulas, we offer
exact closed-form expressions for the outage probability, the higher-order
amount of fading, and the average bit-error rate of a variety of binary
modulations in terms of the Meijer's G function. Further, an exact closed-form
expression for the end-to-end ergodic capacity for the Nakagami-$m$-unified FSO
relay links is derived in terms of the bivariate G function. All the given
results are verified via Computer-based Monte-Carlo simulations.

fixated to regularly spaced locations by means of elastic springs. The
particles are assumed to be driven by a Gaussian noise and to have dissipative,
energy-conserving or anti-dissipative (flipper-like) interactions, when the
particle density exceeds a critical threshold. While each particle in
separation shows a wellbehaved behavior characterized by a Gaussian velocity
distribution, the interaction of particles at high densities can cause an
avalanche-like momentum and energy transfer, which can generate steep power
laws without a well-defined variance and mean value. Specifically, the velocity
variance increases dramatically towards the free boundaries of the
driven-many-particle system. The model might also have some relevance for a
better understanding of crowd disasters. Our results suggest that these are
most likely caused by passive momentum transfers, and not by active pushing.
