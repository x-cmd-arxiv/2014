retrial queue and its easier relative; and (B) the multiserver M/M/infinity
Markov modulated queue.
  The linear rates imply that the stationary probabilities satisfy a recurrence
with linear coefficients; as known from previous work, they yield a
``minimal/non-dominant"" solution of this recurrence, which may be computed
numerically by matrix continued-fraction methods.
  Furthermore, the generating function of the stationary probabilities
satisfies a linear differential system with polynomial coefficients, which
calls for the venerable but still developing theory of holonomic (or D-finite)
linear differential systems.
  We provide a differential system for our generating function that unifies
problems (A) and (B), and we also include some additional features and observe
that in at least one particular case we get a special ``Okubo-type
hypergeometric system"", a family that recently spurred considerable interest.
  The differential system should allow further study of the Taylor coefficients
of the expansion of the generating function at three points of interest: 1) the
irregular singularity at 0; 2) the dominant regular singularity, which yields
asymptotic series via classic methods like the Frobenius vector expansion; and
3) the point 1, whose Taylor series coefficients are the factorial moments.

emission originating from primary and secondary electrons produced in dark

better fit to the spectrum of the excess than the pure b-bbar channel. We
conclude our work with a discussion on constraints on these leptophilic

Theatregoers enter the theatre along aisles and pick a row which they enter
along one of its two entrances so as to occupy a seat. Assume they select their
seats uniformly and independently at random among the empty ones. A row of
seats is narrow and an occupant who is already occupying a seat is blocking
passage to new incoming theatregoers. As a consequence, occupying a specific
seat depends on the courtesy of theatregoers and their willingness to get up so
as to create free space that will allow passage to others. Thus, courtesy
facilitates and may well increase the overall seat occupancy of the theatre. We
say a theatregoer is courteous if (s)he will get up to let others pass.
Otherwise, the theatregoer is selfish. A set of theatregoers is $p$-courteous
if each theatregoer in the set is courteous with probability $p$, randomly and
independently. It is assumed that the behaviour of a theatregoer does not
change during the occupancy of the row.
  In this paper, we are interested in the following question: what is the
expected number of occupied seats as a function of the total number of seats in
a theatre, $n$, and the probability that a theatregoer is courteous, $p$? We
study and analyze interesting variants of this problem reflecting behaviour of
the theatregoers as entirely selfish, and $p$-courteous for a row of seats with
one or two entrances and as a consequence for a theatre with $m$ rows of seats
with multiple aisles. We also consider the case where seats in a row are chosen
according to the geometric distribution and the Zipf distibrution (as opposed
to the uniform distribution) and provide bounds on the occupancy of a row (and
thus the theatre) in each case.

the form $a_{1}\prec\dots\prec a_{k}$, with $\{a_{1},\dots
a_{k}\}\subset\{1,\dots,n\}$ and $k < n$. Though they arise in many modern
applications, only a few methods have been introduced to manipulate them, most
of them consisting in representing any incomplete ranking by the set of all its
possible linear extensions on $\{1,\; \ldots,\; n\}$. It is the major purpose
of this paper to introduce a completely novel approach, which allows to treat
incomplete rankings directly, representing them as injective words over $\{1,\;
\ldots,\; n\}$. Unexpectedly, operations on incomplete rankings have very
simple equivalents in this setting and the topological structure of the complex
of injective words can be interpretated in a simple fashion from the
perspective of ranking. We exploit this connection here and use recent results
from algebraic topology to construct a multiresolution analysis and develop a
wavelet framework for incomplete rankings. Though purely combinatorial, this
construction relies on the same ideas underlying multiresolution analysis on a
Euclidean space, and permits to localize the information related to rankings on
each subset of items. It can be viewed as a crucial step toward nonlinear
approximation of distributions of incomplete rankings and paves the way for
many statistical applications, including preference data analysis and the
design of recommender systems.

eikonal approximation, which governs the high-energy evolution of the
scattering between a dilute projectile and a dense target with an arbitrary
longitudinal extent (a nucleus, or a slice of quark-gluon plasma). Different
physical regimes refer to the ratio $L/\tau$ between the longitudinal size $L$
of the target and the lifetime $\tau$ of the gluon fluctuations. When $L/\tau
\ll 1$, meaning that the target can be effectively treated as a shockwave, we
recover the JIMWLK Hamiltonian, as expected. When $L/\tau \gg 1$, meaning that
the fluctuations live inside the target, the new Hamiltonian governs phenomena
like the transverse momentum broadening and the radiative energy loss, which
accompany the propagation of an energetic parton through a dense QCD medium.
Using this Hamiltonian, we derive a non-linear equation for the dipole
amplitude (a generalization of the BK equation), which describes the
high-energy evolution of jet quenching. As compared to the original BK-JIMWLK
evolution, the new evolution is remarkably different: the plasma saturation
momentum evolves much faster with increasing energy (or decreasing Bjorken's
$x$) than the corresponding scale for a shockwave (nucleus). This widely opens
the transverse phase-space for the evolution and implies the existence of large
radiative corrections, enhanced by the double logarithm $\ln^2(LT)$, with $T$
the temperature of the medium. This confirms and explains from a physical
perspective a recent result by Liou, Mueller, and Wu (arXiv:1304.7677). The
dominant corrections are smooth enough to be absorbed into a renormalization of
the jet quenching parameter $\hat q$. This renormalization is controlled by a
linear equation supplemented with a saturation boundary, which emerges via
controlled approximations from the generalized BK equation alluded to above.

the different EEG channels. It is based on dipole fitting that is usually used
in order to find a solution to the classic problems in EEG analysis: inverse
and forward problems. The suggested compression system uses dipole fitting as a
first building block to provide an approximation of the recorded signals. Then,
(based on a smoothness factor,) appropriate coding techniques are suggested to
compress the residuals of the fitting process. Results show that this technique
works well for different types of recordings and is even able to provide near-
lossless compression for event-related potentials.

are the available time series analysis techniques for the stock market closing

dates are collected into a database and text mining is applied over the news,
the text mining part has been kept simple with only term frequency-inverse
document frequency method. For the time series analysis part, we have studied
10 different methods such as random walk, moving average, acceleration,
Bollinger band, price rate of change, periodic average, difference, momentum or
relative strength index and their variation. In this study we have also
explained these techniques in a comparative way and we have applied the methods
over Turkish Stock Market closing values for more than a 2 year period. On the
other hand, we have applied the term frequency-inverse document frequency

to make a fake identity of a real user in order to access to private

networks is proposed. In this method, first, the social network is shown in a
form of graph, then, according to similarities among users, this graph is
divided into smaller communities. Afterwards, all of the similar profiles to
the real profile are gathered (from the same community), then strength of
relationship (among all selected profiles and the real profile) is calculated,
and those which have the less strength of relationship will be verified by
mutual friend system. In this study, in order to evaluate the effectiveness of

sensors share their local noisy (and potentially spatially correlated)

pattern defined by an adjacency matrix. Each sensor connected to a central
entity, known as the fusion center (FC), forms a linear combination of the
observations to which it has access and sends the resulting signal to the FC
through an orthogonal fading channel. The FC combines these received signals to
find the best linear unbiased estimator of the vector of unknown signals
observed by individual sensors. The main novelty of this paper is the
derivation of an optimal power-allocation scheme in which the coefficients used
to form linear combinations of noisy observations at the sensors connected to
the FC are optimized. Through this optimization, the total estimation
distortion at the FC is minimized, given a constraint on the maximum cumulative
transmit power in the entire network. Numerical results show that even with a
moderate connectivity across the network, spatial collaboration among sensors
significantly reduces the estimation distortion at the FC.

to measure the system performance with respect to stochastic switching. In this
perspective, Wasserstein metric that assesses the distance between probability
density functions is applied to provide the performance and the robustness

prove that the convergence of this metric implies the mean square stability.

component size is equivalent to solving a matrix one-norm minimization problem
whose column vectors are orthogonal and sparse and they form a basis of the
null space of the associated graph Laplacian matrix. A greedy node removal
algorithm is then proposed based on the matrix one-norm minimization. In
comparison with other node centralities such as node degree and betweenness,
experimental results on US power grid dataset validate the effectiveness of the
proposed approach in terms of reduction of the largest component size with
relatively few node removals.

HST-identified proplyds and detected 21 of them. Eight of those disks were
detected for the first time at submillimeter wavelengths, including the most
prominent, well-known proplyd in the entire Orion Nebula, 114-426. Thermal dust
emission in excess of any free-free component was measured in all but one of
the detected disks, and ranged between 1-163 mJy, with resulting disk masses of
0.3-79 Mjup. An additional 26 stars with no prior evidence of associated disks
in HST observations were also imaged within the 5 fields, but only 2 were
detected. The disk mass upper limits for the undetected targets, which include
OB stars, theta1Ori C and theta1Ori F, range from 0.1-0.6 Mjup. Combining these
ALMA data with previous SMA observations, we find a lack of massive (>3 Mjup)
disks in the extreme-UV dominated region of Orion, within 0.03 pc of O-star
theta1Ori C. At larger separations from theta1Ori C, in the far-UV dominated
region, there is a wide range of disk masses, similar to what is found in
low-mass star forming regions. Taken together, these results suggest that a
rapid dissipation of disk masses likely inhibits potential planet formation in
the extreme-UV dominated regions of OB associations, but leaves disks in the

the expansion of the ""Fermi bubbles"". Our data implies an shock-expansion

shown an apparent tension with the present value of the Hubble parameter
inferred from local observations of supernovae, which look closer, i.e.
brighter, than what is expected in a homogeneous model with a value of $H_0$
equal to the one estimated from CMB observations. We examine the possibility
that such a discrepancy is the consequence of the presence of a local
inhomogeneity seeded by primordial curvature perturbations, finding that a
negative peak of the order of less than two standard deviations could allow to
fit low red-shift supernovae observations without the need of using a value of
the Hubble parameter different from $H_0^{CMB}$. The type of inhomogeneity we
consider does not modify the distance to the last scattering, making it
compatible with the constraints of the PLANCK mission data. Our calculation is
fully relativistic and non perturbative, and for this reason shows important
effects which were missed in the previous investigations using relativistic
perturbations or Newtonian approximations, because the structures seeded by
primordial curvature perturbations can be today highly non linear, and
relativist Doppler terms cannot be neglected.
  Comparison with studies of local structure based on galaxy surveys and
luminosity density analysis reveals that the density profile we find could in
fact be compatible with the one obtained for the same region of sky where is
located most of the Cepheids used to calibrate the luminosity distance of the
supernovae employed for the local $H_0$ estimation, suggesting a possible
directional dependence and calibration bias which could be partially attributed
to the presence of the Sloan Great Wall.

structure constant $\alpha$ we consider a theory where the electric charge, and
consequently $\alpha$, is not a constant but depends on the Ricci scalar $R$.
%We then show how this can be considered a particular case of the Bekenstein
theory in which there is no need to %introduce an additional kinetic term for
the scalar field associated to the electric charge, since the Einstein's%
%equations are sufficient to determine the geometry and, consequently the Ricci
scalar. We then study the cosmological implications of this theory, considering
in particular the effects of dark energy and of a cosmological constant on the
evolution of $\alpha$. Some low-red shift expressions for the variation of
$\alpha(z)$ are derived, showing the effects of the equation of state of dark
energy on $\alpha$ and observing how future measurements of the variation of
the fine structure constant could be used to determine indirectly the equation
of state of dark energy and test this theory. In the case of a $\Lambda CDM$
Universe, according to the current estimations of the cosmological parameters,
the present value of the Ricci scalar is $\approx 10%$ smaller than its future
asymptotic value determined by the value of the cosmological constant, setting
also a bound on the future asymptotic value of $\alpha$.

the presence of a carrying capacity depending on the population with delay. In
an earlier work, we presented an exhaustive classification of the logistic
equation where the carrying capacity is linearly dependent on the population
with a time delay, which we refer to as the ""linear delayed carrying capacity""
model. Here, we generalize it to the case of a nonlinear delayed carrying
capacity. The nonlinear functional form of the carrying capacity characterizes
the delayed feedback of the evolving population on the capacity of their
surrounding by either creating additional means for survival or destroying the
available resources. The previously studied linear approximation for the
capacity assumed weak feedback, while the nonlinear form is applicable to
arbitrarily strong feedback. The nonlinearity essentially changes the behavior
of solutions to the evolution equation, as compared to the linear case. All
admissible dynamical regimes are analyzed, which can be of the following types:
punctuated unbounded growth, punctuated increase or punctuated degradation to a
stationary state, convergence to a stationary state with sharp reversals of
plateaus, oscillatory attenuation, everlasting fluctuations, everlasting
up-down plateau reversals, and divergence in finite time. The theorem is proved
that, for the case characterizing the evolution under gain and competition,
solutions are always bounded, if the feedback is destructive. We find that even
a small noise level profoundly affects the position of the finite-time
singularities. Finally, we demonstrate the feasibility of predicting the
critical time of solutions having finite-time singularities from the knowledge
of a simple quadratic approximation of the early time dynamics.

interference between the top-Yukawa and the gauge-Higgs diagrams can be

auxiliary symmetry in a theory in such a way that the eigenvalue spectrum of
the fermion functional determinant is made up of complex conjugated pairs. The
method implies a particular way of introducing and integrating over auxiliary
fields related to a set of artificial shift symmetries. Gauge-fixing the
artificial continuous shift symmetries in the direct and dual sectors leads to
the implementation of direct and dual BRST-type global symmetries and of a
symplectic structure over the field space (as prescribed by the
Batalin-Vilkovisky method). A procedure similar to Kahler polarization in
geometric quantization guarantees the possibility to choose a Kahler structure
over the field space. This structure is generated by a special way of
performing gauge fixing over the direct and dual sectors. The desired discrete
symmetry appears to be induced by the Hodge-* operator. The particular
extension of the field space presented here makes the operators of the de-Rham
cohomology manifest. These become symmetries in the extended theory. This
method implies the identification of the (anti)-BRST and dual-(anti)-BRST
operators with the exterior derivative and its dual in the context of the
complex de-Rham cohomology.

quantum no-go-theorems have convinced many that there is no realistic framework

knowledge *about*. This paper develops the case that there is a plausible
underlying reality: one actual spacetime-based history, although with behavior
that appears strange when analyzed dynamically (one time-slice at a time). By
using a simple model with no dynamical laws, it becomes evident that this
behavior is actually quite natural when analyzed ""all-at-once"" (as in classical
action principles). From this perspective, traditional quantum states would
represent incomplete information about possible spacetime histories,
conditional on the future measurement geometry. Without dynamical laws imposing
additional restrictions, those histories can have a classical probability
distribution, where exactly one history can be said to represent an underlying
reality.

possible inconsistency in Laplace's principle of insufficient reason. In this
article we show that Bertrand's paradox contains two different problems: an
""easy"" problem and a ""hard"" problem. The easy problem can be solved by
formulating Bertrand's question in sufficiently precise terms, so allowing for
a non ambiguous modelization of the entity subjected to the randomization. We
then show that once the easy problem is settled, also the hard problem becomes
solvable, provided Laplace's principle of insufficient reason is applied not to
the outcomes of the experiment, but to the different possible ""ways of
selecting"" an interaction between the entity under investigation and that
producing the randomization. This consists in evaluating a huge average over
all possible ""ways of selecting"" an interaction, which we call a 'universal
average'. Following a strategy similar to that used in the definition of the
Wiener measure, we calculate such universal average and therefore solve the
hard problem of Bertrand's paradox. The link between Bertrand's problem of
probability theory and the measurement problem of quantum mechanics is also
briefly discussed.
