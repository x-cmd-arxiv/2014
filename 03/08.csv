partonic dijets in the quark-gluon plasma may affect the direct, elliptic and
triangular flow of low (and intermediate) $p_T$ hadrons in central Au+Au
collisions at RHIC. The dijets are modeled as external sources in the
energy-momentum conservation equations for hydrodynamics, which are solved on
an event-by-event basis within the ideal fluid approximation. We focus our
investigation at mid-rapidity and solve the hydrodynamic equations imposing
boost invariance. Differential anisotropic flow coefficients for $p_T \gtrsim
1$ GeV are found to be significantly enhanced if the dijets deposit on average
more than 12 GeV in the QGP (or more than 6 GeV per jet). Because this
jet-induced extra anisotropic flow is not related to the fluctuations of the
initial geometry of the collision, the correlation between the $v_2$ and $v_3$
coefficients and their corresponding eccentricities is considerably weakened.
In addition, we argue that the extra amount of direct flow induced by dijets
may be quantified by comparing the azimuthal dependence of dihadron
correlations in dijet events with the corresponding quantity obtained in events
without dijets. This comparison could be used to give a rough estimate of the
magnitude of the effective coupling between the jets and the medium.

environmental changes or through fitness interactions with other co-evolving
phenotypes. We analyze a model of trait evolution under mutations and genetic
drift in a single-peak fitness seascape. The fitness peak performs a
constrained random walk in the trait amplitude, which determines the
time-dependent trait optimum in a given population. We derive analytical
expressions for the distribution of the time-dependent trait divergence between
populations and of the trait diversity within populations. Based on this
solution, we develop a method to infer adaptive evolution of quantitative
traits. Specifically, we show that the ratio of the average trait divergence
and the diversity is a universal function of evolutionary time, which predicts
the stabilizing strength and the driving rate of the fitness seascape. From an
information-theoretic point of view, this function measures the
macro-evolutionary entropy in a population ensemble, which determines the
predictability of the evolutionary process. Our solution also quantifies two
key characteristics of adapting populations: the cumulative fitness flux, which
measures the total amount of adaptation, and the adaptive load, which is the
fitness cost due to a population's lag behind the fitness peak.

estimates the causal effects of a treatment by exploiting naturally occurring

or intervention is administered according to a pre-specified rule linked to a
continuous variable. Such thresholds are common in primary care drug
prescription where the RD design can be used to estimate the causal effect of
medication in the general population. Such results can then be contrasted to
those obtained from randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and inform prescription
policy and guidelines based on a more realistic and less expensive context. In
this paper we focus on statins, a class of cholesterol-lowering drugs, however,
the methodology can be applied to many other drugs provided these are
prescribed in accordance to pre-determined guidelines. NHS guidelines state
that statins should be prescribed to patients with 10 year cardiovascular
disease risk scores in excess of 20%. If we consider patients whose scores are
close to this threshold we find that there is an element of random variation in
both the risk score itself and its measurement. We can thus consider the
threshold a randomising device assigning the prescription to units just above
the threshold and withholds it from those just below. Thus we are effectively
replicating the conditions of an RCT in the area around the threshold, removing
or at least mitigating confounding. We frame the RD design in the language of
conditional independence which clarifies the assumptions necessary to apply it
to data, and which makes the links with instrumental variables clear. We also
have context specific knowledge about the expected sizes of the effects of
statin prescription and are thus able to incorporate this into Bayesian models

  formation by gravitationally unstable discs","Accepted to MNRAS. 13 pages",,"10.1093/mnras/stu473",,"astro-ph.EP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Giant planet formation in the core accretion (CA) paradigm is predicated by
the formation of a core, assembled by the coagulation of grains and later by
planetesimals within a protoplanetary disc. In contrast, in the disc
instability paradigm, giant planet formation is believed to be independent of
core formation: massive self-gravitating gas fragments cool radiatively and
collapse as a whole. We show that giant planet formation in the disc
instability model may be also enhanced by core formation for reasons physically
very similar to the CA paradigm. In the model explored here, efficient grain
sedimentation within an initial fragment (rather than the disc) leads to the
formation of a core composed of heavy elements. We find that massive
atmospheres form around cores and undergo collapse as a critical core mass is
exceeded, analogous to CA theory. The critical mass of the core to initiate
such a collapse depends on the fragment mass and metallicity, as well as core
luminosity, but ranges from less than 1 to as much as $\sim80$ Earth masses. We
therefore suggest that there are two channels for the collapse of a gaseous
fragment to planetary scales within the disc instability model: (i) H$_2$
dissociative collapse of the entire gaseous clump, and (ii) core-assisted gas
capture, as presented here. We suggest that the first of these two is favoured
in metal-poor environments and for fragments more massive than $\sim 5-10$
Jupiter masses, whereas the second is favored in metal-rich environments and
fragments of lower mass. [Abridged]

currently undergoing an intense starburst likely caused by a recent minor
interaction, using data from the PPAK Integral Field Spectroscopy (IFS) Nearby
Galaxies Survey (PINGS). With data from a large sample of about a hundred HII
regions identified throughout the disc and spiral arms we derive, using
strong-line metallicity indicators and direct derivations, a rather flat
gaseous abundance gradient. Thus, metal mixing processes occurred, as in
observed galaxy interactions. Spectra from PINGS data and additional
multiwavelength imaging were used to perform a spectral energy distribution
fitting to the stellar emission and a photoionization modelling of the nebulae.
The ionizing stellar population is characterized by single populations with a
narrow age range (2.5-5 Myr) and a broad range of masses ($10^4-6\times10^6
M_\odot$). The effect of dust grains in the nebulae is important, indicating
that 25-70% of the ultraviolet photons can be absorbed by dust. The ionizing
stellar population within the HII regions represents typically a few percent of
the total stellar mass. This ratio, a proxy to the specific star formation
rate, presents a flat or negative radial gradient. Therefore, minor
interactions may indeed play an important role in the mass build-up of the
bulge.

During the first about two days of the outburst, the source was observed by
MAXI to undergo a very rapid transition from a hard to a softer spectral state.
While the hard state was not efficiently monitored because the transition
occurred so rapidly, the evolution of the source outburst in the softer state
was covered quasi-simultaneously in a broad energy range (0.6-150 keV) by the
instruments on-board INTEGRAL and Swift. During these observations, the spectra
measured from the source displayed both a prominent thermal emission with
temperature kT 0.7 keV and a power-law hard component with a photon index gamma
2.2 extending to 200 keV. The properties of the source in the X-ray domain are
reminiscent of those displayed by black hole transients during the soft
intermediate state, which supports the association of MAXI J1828-249 with this

although there are theoretical reasons to think that at least some come from
active galactic nuclei (AGNs). One way to assess the different hypotheses is by
analysing the arrival directions of UHECRs, in particular their
self-clustering. We have developed a fully Bayesian approach to analyzing the
self-clustering of points on the sphere, which we apply to the UHECR arrival
directions. The analysis is based on a multi-step approach that enables the
application of Bayesian model comparison to cases with weak prior information.
We have applied this approach to the 69 highest energy events recorded by the
Pierre Auger Observatory (PAO), which is the largest current UHECR data set. We
do not detect self-clustering, but simulations show that this is consistent
with the AGN-sourced model for a data set of this size. Data sets of several
hundred UHECRs would be sufficient to detect clustering in the AGN model.
Samples of this magnitude are expected to be produced by future experiments,
such as the Japanese Experiment Module Extreme Universe Space Observatory
(JEM-EUSO).

distributed, it gives rise to a Zipf law for the number of customers. We
perform an exact calculation for the utilization fraction for the case when
choices are made independent of fitness. A variant of the model is also
introduced where the fitness can be treated as an ability to stay in the
business. When a restaurant loses customers, its fitness is replaced by a
random fitness. The steady state fitness distribution is characterized by a
power law, while the distribution of the number of customers still follows the
Zipf law, implying the robustness of the model. Our model serves as a paradigm
for the emergence of Zipf law in city size distribution.

effect of the non-centrosymmetric interaction on its phase behavior. Two
different phase transitions are identified for this model system. Upon
increasing the volume fraction, an abrupt liquid-to-crystal transition first
occurs at a significantly lower volume fraction in comparison to that of the
centro-charged system. This is due to the stronger effective inter-particle
repulsion caused by the additional charge anisotropy. Moreover, within the
crystal state at higher volume fraction, the system further undergoes a
continuous disorder-to-order transition with respect to the charge orientation.
Detailed analyses in this work disclose the nature of these transitions, and
orientation fluctuation may cause non-centrosymmetric unit cells. The
dependence of crystal formation and orientational ordering on temperature was
also examined. These findings indicate that the non-centrosymmetric interaction
in this work results in additional freedoms to fine-tune the phase diagram and
increase the functionalities of materials. Moreover, these model studies are
essential to advance our future understanding regarding the fundamental
physiochemical properties of novel Janus colloidal particles and protein
crystallization conditions.

of different kinds of multiferroic material: single-phase and composite

nanostructures have higher magnitude direct ME coupling values and clear
evidence of indirect ME coupling compared with bulk materials. Promising ME

investigate the link between the type III radio burst starting frequency and
hard X-ray spectral index. For a proportion of events the relation derived
between the starting height (frequency) of type III radio bursts and the
electron beam velocity spectral index (deduced from X-rays) is used to infer
the spatial properties (height and size) of the electron beam acceleration
region. Both quantities can be related to the distance travelled before an
electron beam becomes unstable to Langmuir waves. To obtain a list of suitable
events we considered the RHESSI catalogue of X-ray flares and the Phoenix 2
catalogue of type III radio bursts. From the 200 events that showed both type
III and X-ray signatures, we selected 30 events which had simultaneous emission
in both wavelengths, good signal to noise in the X-ray domain and > 20 seconds
duration. We find that > 50 % of the selected events show a good correlation
between the starting frequencies of the groups of type III bursts and the hard
X-ray spectral indices. A low-high-low trend for the starting frequency of type
III bursts is frequently observed. Assuming a background electron density model
and the thick target approximation for X-ray observations, this leads to a
correlation between starting heights of the type III emission and the beam
electron spectral index. Using this correlation we infer the altitude and
vertical extents of the flare acceleration regions. We find heights from 183 Mm
down to 25 Mm while the sizes range from 13 Mm to 2 Mm. These values agree with
previous work that places an extended flare acceleration region high in the
corona. We analyse the assumptions required and explore possible extensions to
our assumed model. We discuss these results with respect to the acceleration
heights and sizes derived from X-ray observations alone.

be formed from the photodissociation of CO in dense tori. In this work, using
VISIR/VLT, we spatially resolved the emission of the PAH bands and ionised
emission from the [SIV] line, confirming the presence of dense central tori in
all the observed O-rich objects. Furthermore, we show that for most of the
objects, PAHs are located at the outer edge of these dense/compact tori, while
the ionised material is mostly present in the inner parts of these tori,
consistent with our hypothesis for the formation of PAHs in these systems. The
presence of a dense torus has been strongly associated with the action of a
central binary star and, as such, the rich chemistry seen in these regions may

important objective of research in quantum science and technology. Since
photons do not interact directly, this goal requires, e.g., an optical medium
in which the light experiences a phase shift that depends nonlinearly on the
photon number. Once the additional phase shift for two photons reaches pi, such
an ultra-strong nonlinearity could even enable the direct implementation of
high-fidelity quantum logic operations. However, the nonlinear response of
standard optical media is many orders of magnitude too weak for this task.
Here, we demonstrate the realization of an optical fiber-based nonlinearity
that leads to an additional two-photon phase shift close to the ideal value of
pi. Our scheme employs a whispering-gallery-mode resonator, interfaced by an
optical nanofiber, where the presence of a single rubidium atom in the
resonator results in a strongly nonlinear response. We experimentally show that
this results in entanglement of initially independent incident photons. The
demonstration of this ultra-strong nonlinearity in a fiber-integrated system is
a decisive step towards scalable quantum logics with optical photons.

Assuming the existence of an astrophysical background described by the IC
best-fit, we also show that, for the decay of even heavier DM particles

walk-summability of the grid graph, the Markov graph of the voltage angles can
be determined by the power grid graph. Therefore, a discrepancy between
calculated Markov graph and learned structure should trigger the alarm. Local
grid topology is available online from the protection system and we exploit it
to check for mismatch. Should a mismatch be detected, we use correlation
anomaly score to detect the set of attacked nodes. Our method can detect the
most recent stealthy deception attack on the power grid that assumes knowledge
of bus-branch model of the system and is capable of deceiving the state

The control signals of the distributed resources are updated in response to a

exchanged via communication among neighboring resources. We show that such a

can stabilize the system. Moreover, since our control scheme takes advantage of
both the ACE signal and peer-to-peer communication, simulation results
demonstrate that our control scheme can stabilize the system significantly
faster than the AGC framework. Also, an important feature of our scheme is that
it performs $c\epsilon$-close to the centralized optimal economic dispatch,

the context of topological Majorana zero mode that represents a local half
degree of freedom carrying non-Abelian statistics.In this paper, we investigate
the topological nature of a Majorana fermion by assuming that it is made up of
four Majorana zero modes at cutoff energy scale. First, we show that a pair of
Majorana zero modes can realize a $T^4=-1$ time reversal symmetry, a $P^4=-1$
parity symmetry and even a nontrivial $\overline C^4=-1$ charge conjugation
symmetry. Next, we propose a $\overline CPT$ super algebra for the Majorana
fermion made up of four Majorana zero modes. Furthermore, the origin of three
generations of neutrinos(assuming they are Majorana fermions) can be naturally
explained as three distinguishable ways to form a pair of (local) complex
fermions out of four Majorana zero modes. Finally, we compute the neutrino mass
mixing matrix and mass ratios of the three mass eigenstates from a first
principle at leading order(in the absence of $CP$ violation and charged lepton
corrections). We obtain $\theta_{12} =31.7^\circ$, $\theta_{23}=45^\circ$,

inferred using asteroseismology. Cool stars with convective envelopes have
turbulent motions that can stochastically drive and damp pulsations. The
properties of the oscillation frequency power spectrum can be tied to mass and
radius through solar-scaled asteroseismic relations. Stellar properties derived
using these scaling relations need verification over a range of metallicities.
Because the age and mass of halo stars are well-constrained by astrophysical
priors, they provide an independent, empirical check on asteroseismic mass
estimates in the low-metallicity regime. We identify nine metal-poor red giants
(including six stars that are kinematically associated with the halo) from a
sample observed by both the Kepler space telescope and the Sloan Digital Sky
Survey-III APOGEE spectroscopic survey. We compare masses inferred using
asteroseismology to those expected for halo and thick-disk stars. Although our
sample is small, standard scaling relations, combined with asteroseismic
parameters from the APOKASC Catalog, produce masses that are systematically
higher (<{\Delta}M>=0.17+/-0.05 Msun) than astrophysical expectations. The
magnitude of the mass discrepancy is reduced by known theoretical corrections
to the measured large frequency separation scaling relationship. Using
alternative methods for measuring asteroseismic parameters induces systematic
shifts at the 0.04 Msun level. We also compare published asteroseismic analyses
with scaling relationship masses to examine the impact of using the frequency
of maximum power as a constraint. Upcoming APOKASC observations will provide a
larger sample of ~100 metal-poor stars, important for detailed asteroseismic
characterization of Galactic stellar populations.

radiation field is characterized by blackbodies with temperatures >~ 80 K, as
might be found in ultraluminous infrared galaxies. In agreement with previous
work, we find that Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities develop in radiation supported
atmospheres, leading to inhomogeneities that limit momentum exchange between
radiation and dusty gas, and eventually providing a near balance of the
radiation and gravitational forces. However, the evolution of the velocity and
spatial distributions of the gas differs significantly from previous work,
which utilized a less accurate flux-limited diffusion (FLD) method. Our VET
simulations show continuous net acceleration of the gas, with no steady-state
reached by the end of the simulation. In contrast, FLD results show little net
acceleration of the gas and settle in to a quasi-steady, turbulent state with
low velocity dispersion. The discrepancies result primarily from the inability
of FLD to properly model the variation of the radiation field around structures
that are less than a few optical depths across. We conclude that radiation
feedback remains a viable mechanism for driving high-Mach number turbulence. We
discuss implications for observed systems and global numerical simulations of

colors observed by SDSS, 2MASS, and WISE. Median colors are determined using
1,052,793 stars with r-band extinction less than 0.125. We use this locus to
measure the dust extinction curve relative to the r-band, which is consistent
with previous measurements in the SDSS and 2MASS bands. The WISE band
extinction coefficients are larger than predicted by standard extinction
models. Using 13 lines of sight, we find variations in the extinction curve in
H, Ks, and WISE bandpasses. Relative extinction decreases towards Galactic
anti-center, in agreement with prior studies. Relative extinction increases
with Galactic latitude, in contrast to previous observations. This indicates a
universal mid-IR extinction law does not exist due to variations in dust grain
size and chemistry with Galactocentric position. A preliminary search for
outliers due to warm circumstellar dust is also presented, using stars with
high signal-to-noise in the W3-band. We find 199 such outliers, identified by
excess emission in Ks-W3. Inspection of SDSS images for these outliers reveals
a large number of contaminants due to nearby galaxies. Six sources appear to be
genuine dust candidates, yielding a fraction of systems with infrared excess of
0.12$\pm$0.05%.

observed in tumor tissue. Recurrent aberrations, occurring in the same region
across multiple subjects, are of interest because they may highlight genes
associated with tumor development or progression. A number of tools have been
proposed to assess the statistical significance of recurrent DNA copy number
aberrations, but their statistical properties have not been carefully studied.
Cyclic shift testing, a permutation procedure using independent random shifts
of genomic marker observations on the genome, has been proposed to identify
recurrent aberrations, and is potentially useful for a wider variety of
purposes, including identifying regions with methylation aberrations or
overrepresented in disease association studies. For data following a
countable-state Markov model, we prove the asymptotic validity of cyclic shift
$p$-values under a fixed sample size regime as the number of observed markers
tends to infinity. We illustrate cyclic shift testing for a variety of data
types, producing biologically relevant findings for three publicly available

moduli plots as well as 3-D directivity patterns for an elastic PMMA sphere

embryos. While the debris released in the impact remains in a clump for only a
single orbit, there is a much longer lasting asymmetry caused by the fact that
all debris must pass through the collision-point. The resulting asymmetry is
stationary, it does not orbit the star. The debris is concentrated in a clump
at the collision-point, with a more diffuse structure on the opposite side. The
asymmetry lasts for typically around 1000 orbital periods of the progenitor,
which can be several Myr at distances of ~50 AU. We describe how the appearance
of the asymmetric disc depends on the mass and eccentricity of the progenitor,
as well as viewing orientation. The wavelength of observation, which determines
the grain sizes probed, is also important. Notably, the increased collision
rate of the debris at the collision-point makes this the dominant production
site for any secondary dust and gas created. For dust small enough to be
removed by radiation pressure, and gas with a short lifetime, this causes their
distribution to resemble a jet emanating from the (stationary) collision-point.
We suggest that the asymmetries seen at large separations in some debris discs,
like Beta Pictoris, could be the result of giant impacts. If so this would
indicate that planetary embryos are present and continuing to grow at several
tens of AU at ages of up to tens of Myr.

particularly challenging, when the metric is computed from user feedback such

case of Web search, any change to a component of the search engine may result
in a different search result page for the same query, but we normally cannot
infer reliably from search log how users would react to the new result page.
Consequently, it appears impossible to accurately estimate online metrics that
depend on user feedback, unless the new engine is run to serve users and
compared with a baseline in an A/B test. This approach, while valid and
successful, is unfortunately expensive and time-consuming. In this paper, we
propose to address this problem using causal inference techniques, under the
contextual-bandit framework. This approach effectively allows one to run
(potentially infinitely) many A/B tests offline from search log, making it
possible to estimate and optimize online metrics quickly and inexpensively.
Focusing on an important component in a commercial search engine, we show how
these ideas can be instantiated and applied, and obtain very promising results
that suggest the wide applicability of these techniques.

by a set of kinetic equations for a dense neutrino gas evolving both in space
and time. Solutions of these equations have been typically worked out assuming
that either the time (in the core-collapse supernova environment) or space (in
the early universe) homogeneity in the initial conditions is preserved through
the evolution. In these cases one can gauge away the homogeneous variable and
reduce the dimensionality of the problem. In this paper we investigate if small
deviations from an initial postulated homogeneity can be amplified by the
interacting neutrino gas, leading to a new flavor instability. To this end, we
consider a simple two flavor isotropic neutrino gas evolving in time, and
initially composed by only $\nu_e$ and $\bar\nu_e$ with equal densities. In the
homogeneous case, this system shows a bimodal instability in the inverted mass
hierarchy scheme, leading to the well studied flavor pendulum behavior. This
would lead to periodic pair conversions $\nu_e \bar\nu_e \leftrightarrow \nu_x
\bar\nu_x$. To break space homogeneity, we introduce small amplitude
space-dependent perturbations in the matter potential. By Fourier transforming
the equations of motion with respect to the space coordinate, we then
numerically solve a set of coupled equations for the different Fourier modes.
We find that even for arbitrarily tiny inhomogeneities, the system evolution
runs away from the stable pendulum behavior: the different modes are excited
and the space-averaged ensemble evolves towards flavor equilibrium. We finally
comment on the role of a time decaying neutrino background density in weakening
these results.

(and often is) detrimental to inducing a model of the data. Many current
approaches use a single, often biased, measurement to determine if an instance
is noisy. A biased measure may work well on certain data sets, but it can also
be less effective on a broader set of data sets. In this paper, we present
noise identification using classifier diversity (NICD) -- a method for deriving
a less biased noise measurement and integrating it into the learning process.
To lessen the bias of the noise measure, NICD selects a diverse set of
classifiers (based on their predictions of novel instances) to determine which
instances are noisy. We examine NICD as a technique for filtering, instance
weighting, and selecting the base classifiers of a voting ensemble. We compare
NICD with several other noise handling techniques that do not consider
classifier diversity on a set of 54 data sets and 5 learning algorithms. NICD
significantly increases the classification accuracy over the other considered
approaches and is effective across a broad set of data sets and learning
algorithms.

TTV applications often require the numerical integration of orbits for
computation of transit times (as well as impact parameters and durations);

created a fast code for transit timing computation, TTVFast, which uses a
symplectic integrator with a Keplerian interpolator for the calculation of
transit times (Nesvorny et al. 2013). The speed comes at the expense of
accuracy in the calculated times, but the accuracy lost is largely unnecessary,
as transit times do not need to be calculated to accuracies significantly
smaller than the measurement uncertainties on the times. The time step can be
tuned to give sufficient precision for any particular system. We find a
speed-up of at least an order of magnitude relative to dynamical integrations

X-ray flux. The neutron star shows very strong pulsations with a period of P ~
18.8 s. The 0.8-79 keV broad-band spectrum can be described by a power-law with
an exponential cutoff and a black-body component at low energies. During the
second observation we detect a cyclotron resonant scattering feature at 12.5
keV, which is absent in the phase-averaged spectra of observations 1 and 3.
Pulse phase-resolved spectroscopy reveals that the strength of the feature
changes strongly with pulse phase and is most prominent during the broad

an approximated version of the cost functional and the resulting solution is
not necessarily sparse at group levels. This paper reformulates the

are evaluated on three different applications - multiview face recognition,
multimodal face recognition, and target classification.

signal between an ensemble's mean field and its time delayed state, filtered
and fed back to the ensemble, can suppress the self-synchronization in the
ensemble. These individual units are decoupled and stabilized at the desired
desynchronized states while the stimulation signal reduces to the noise level.
The effectiveness of the method is illustrated by examples of two different
populations of globally coupled chaotic-bursting neurons. The proposed method
has potential for mild, effective and demand-controlled therapy of neurological
diseases characterized by pathological synchronization.

actions. To do so, we designed an interception task in which subjects had to
indicate the time when a moving object, whose trajectory was occluded, would
reach a target area. Subjects made their judgments based on a brief display of
the object's initial motion at a given starting point. Based on the known
illusion that slow contrast stimuli appear to move slower than high contrast
ones, we predict that if perception directly influences motion actions subjects
would show delayed interception times for low contrast objects. In order to
provide a more quantitative prediction, we developed a Bayesian model for the
complete sensory-motor interception task. Using fit parameters for the prior
and likelihood on visual speed from a previous study we were able to predict
not only the expected interception times but also the precise characteristics
of response variability. Psychophysical experiments confirm the model's
predictions. Individual differences in subjects' timing responses can be
accounted for by individual differences in the perceptual priors on visual
speed. Taken together, our behavioral and model results show that biases in
perception percolate downstream and cause action biases that are fully
predictable.

The previously identified source SSTB213 J041757 is a proto brown

  Aims. Studying molecular outflows from young brown dwarfs provides important
insight into brown dwarf formation mechanisms, particularly brown dwarfs at the
earliest stages such as class 0, I. We therefore conducted a search for
molecular outflows from SSTB213 J041757.
  Methods. We observed SSTB213 J041757 with the Submillimeter Array to search
for CO molecular outflow emission from the source.
  Results. Our CO maps do not show any outflow emission from the proto brown
dwarf candidate.
  Conclusions. The non-detection implies that the molecular outflows from the
source are weak; deeper observations are therefore needed to probe the outflows
from the source.

identify two stable topological phases in the ground state, which emerge from
spontaneous orbital current order. These currents are driven by electronic
correlations caused by inter-orbital Coulomb interactions. The first
topological phase is an anomalous orbital Hall phase, characterized by a
nonzero Chern number, while the second topological phase has a vanishing Chern

specifically, the interaction-induced novel phase of the quasi-two-dimensional

screened Poisson equation}. Despite being linear, it does not have a
closed-form solution for arbitrary forcing functions. We present two different
techniques to solve the screened Poisson equation. In the first approach we use
a standard perturbation analysis approach to derive a new algorithm which is
guaranteed to converge provided the forcing function is bounded and positive.
The perturbation technique requires a sequence of discrete convolutions which
can be performed in $O(N\log N)$ using the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) where
$N$ is the number of grid points. In the second method we discretize the linear
Laplacian operator by the finite difference method leading to a sparse linear
system of equations which can be solved using the plethora of sparse solvers.
The eikonal solution is recovered from the exponent of the resultant scalar
field. Our approach eliminates the need to explicitly construct viscosity
solutions as customary with direct solutions to the eikonal. Since the linear
equation is computed for a small but non-zero $\hbar$, the obtained solution is
an approximation. Though our solution framework is applicable to the general
class of eikonal problems, we detail specifics for the popular vision
applications of shape-from-shading, vessel segmentation, and path planning.

tool for two way data analysis. Co-clustering is more advantageous over
traditional one dimensional clustering in many ways such as, ability to find
highly correlated sub-groups of rows and columns. However, one of the
overlooked benefits of co-clustering is that, it can be used to extract
meaningful knowledge for various other knowledge extraction purposes. For
example, building predictive models with high dimensional data and
heterogeneous population is a non-trivial task. Co-clusters extracted from such
data, which shows similar pattern in both the dimension, can be used for a more
accurate predictive model building. Several applications such as finding
patient-disease cohorts in health care analysis, finding user-genre groups in
recommendation systems and community detection problems can benefit from
co-clustering technique that utilizes the predictive power of the data to
generate co-clusters for improved data analysis.
  In this paper, we present the novel idea of Predictive Overlapping
Co-Clustering (POCC) as an optimization problem for a more effective and
improved predictive analysis. Our algorithm generates optimal co-clusters by
maximizing predictive power of the co-clusters subject to the constraints on
the number of row and column clusters. In this paper precision, recall and

recent years. To this end, many algorithms have been developed to classify
multi-label data in an effective manner. However, they usually do not consider
the pairwise relations indicated by sample labels, which actually play
important roles in multi-label classification. Inspired by this, we naturally
extend the traditional pairwise constraints to the multi-label scenario via a
flexible thresholding scheme. Moreover, to improve the generalization ability
of the classifier, we adopt a boosting-like strategy to construct a multi-label
ensemble from a group of base classifiers. To achieve these goals, this paper
presents a novel multi-label classification framework named Variable Pairwise
Constraint projection for Multi-label Ensemble (VPCME). Specifically, we take
advantage of the variable pairwise constraint projection to learn a
lower-dimensional data representation, which preserves the correlations between
samples and labels. Thereafter, the base classifiers are trained in the new
data space. For the boosting-like strategy, we employ both the variable
pairwise constraints and the bootstrap steps to diversify the base classifiers.
Empirical studies have shown the superiority of the proposed method in
comparison with other approaches.

  process","42 pages, 13 figures",,,,"math.ST stat.ME stat.TH","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We consider the problem of multiple change-point estimation in the mean of a
Gaussian AR(1) process. Taking into account the dependence structure does not
allow us to use the dynamic programming algorithm, which is the only algorithm
giving the optimal solution in the independent case. We propose a robust
estimator of the autocorrelation parameter, which is consistent and satisfies a
central limit theorem. Then, we propose to follow the classical inference
approach, by plugging this estimator in the criteria used for change-points
estimation. We show that the asymptotic properties of these estimators are the
same as those of the classical estimators in the independent framework. The
same plug-in approach is then used to approximate the modified BIC and choose
the number of segments. This method is implemented in the R package AR1seg and
is available from the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN). This package is
used in the simulation section in which we show that for finite sample sizes
taking into account the dependence structure improves the statistical
performance of the change-point estimators and of the selection criterion.

manifold, if the cross product is definite, otherwise, if the cross product has
the other algebraic type, the manifold is in general stratified with nearly
K\""ahler and nearly para-K\""ahler parts separated by a hypersurface which
canonically carries a Cartan $(2,3,5)$-distribution. This hypersurface is a
projective infinity for the pseudo-Riemannian geometry elsewhere on the
manifold, and we establish how the Cartan distribution can be understood
explicitly, and also in terms of conformal geometry, as a limit of the ambient
nearly (para\nobreakdash-)K\""ahler structures. Any real-analytic
$(2,3,5)$-distribution is seen to arise as such a limit, because we can solve
the geometric Dirichlet problem of building a collar structure equipped with
the required holonomy-reduced projective structure.
  A model geometry for these structures is provided by the projectivization of
the imaginary (split) octonions. Our approach is to use Cartan/tractor theory
to provide a curved version of this geometry, this encodes a curved version of
the algebra of imaginary (split) octonions as a flat structure over its
projectivization. The perspective is used to establish detailed results
concerning the projective compactification of nearly
(para\nobreakdash-)K\""ahler manifolds, including how the almost
(para\nobreakdash-)complex structure and metric smoothly degenerate along the
singular hypersurface to give the distribution there.

has been found that the dynamical behaviour near equilibrium points is
completely determined by the structure of the submanifolds and subspaces. The
non-degenerate equilibrium points are classified into twelve cases. The
necessary and sufficient conditions for linearly stable, non resonant unstable
and resonant equilibrium points are established. Furthermore, the results show
that a resonant equilibrium point is a Hopf bifurcation point. In addition, if
the rotating speed changes, two non degenerate equilibria may collide and
annihilate each other. The theory developed here is lastly applied to two
particular cases, motions around a rotating, homogeneous cube and the asteroid
1620 Geographos. We found that the mutual annihilation of equilibrium points
occurs as the rotating speed increases, and then the first surface shedding
begins near the intersection point of the x axis and the surface. The results
can be applied to planetary science, including the birth and evolution of the
minor bodies in the Solar system, the rotational breakup and surface mass
shedding of asteroids, etc.

to the originating cell, but at distances far from the originating cell a
formula based on an asymptotic expansion has to be used. In this work, we
describe a method to calculate the demagnetizing field by numerical evaluation
of the multidimensional integral in the demagnetization tensor terms using a
sparse grid integration scheme. This method improves the accuracy of
computation at intermediate distances from the origin.
  We compute and report the accuracy of (i) the numerical evaluation of the
exact tensor expression which is best for short distances, (ii) the asymptotic
expansion best suited for large distances, and (iii) the new method based on
numerical integration, which is superior to methods (i) and (ii) for
intermediate distances. For all three methods, we show the measurements of
accuracy and execution time as a function of distance, for calculations using
single precision (4-byte) and double precision (8-byte) floating point
arithmetic. We make recommendations for the choice of scheme order and
integrating coefficients for the numerical integration method (iii).

elliptic equations can be recast as the study of nonlocal
(integro-differential) equations involving elliptic integro-differential
operators on the boundary. This is motivated by a new integro-differential
representation for nonlinear operators with a comparison principle which we
also introduce. In the simple case that the original domain is an infinite
strip with almost periodic Neumann data, this leads to an almost periodic
homogenization problem involving a fully nonlinear integro-differential
operator on the Neumann boundary. This method gives a new proof-- which was
left as an open question in the earlier work of Barles- Da Lio- Lions-
Souganidis (2008)- of the result obtained recently by Choi-Kim-Lee (2013), and
we anticipate that it will generalize to other contexts.

advantages of wrapper subset evaluation with a lower cost and improves the
performance of a group of classifiers. The method uses combination of sample
domain filtering and resampling to refine the sample domain and two feature
subset evaluation methods to select reliable features. This method utilizes
both feature space and sample domain in two phases. The first phase filters and
resamples the sample domain and the second phase adopts a hybrid procedure by
information gain, wrapper subset evaluation and genetic search to find the
optimal feature space. Experiments carried out on different types of datasets
from UCI Repository of Machine Learning databases and the results show a rise
in the average performance of five classifiers (Naive Bayes, Logistic,
Multilayer Perceptron, Best First Decision Tree and JRIP) simultaneously and
the classification error for these classifiers decreases considerably. The
experiments also show that this method outperforms other feature selection
methods with a lower cost.

one-particle states is the main subject of this work. As we know, the little
group which describes massive particle one-particle states' transformations
under the Lorentz transformation is SO(3), while the little group describing
massless states is ISO(2). In this paper, a method which is different from
Inonu-Wigner contraction is used to contract SO(3) group to ISO(2) group. We
use this contraction method to prove that the particle can only have two
helicity one-particle states from the perspective of kinematics, when the
particle mass tends to zero. Our proof is different from the dynamic
explanation in the existing theories.
