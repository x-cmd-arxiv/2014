positive operator-valued measures (POVMs) are of current interest as a useful
tool for operational approach to quantum thermodynamics. Here, two different
operations generating the same thermostatistical state are studied: one is
related to thermofield dynamics and the other is the one proposed in a recent
work [S. Abe, A. R. Usha Devi, A. K. Rajagopal, J. Phys. A: Math. Theor. 43
(2010) 045303]. A comparable study on them shows different behaviors of the von
Neumann entropy under repeated applications of these two operations. It is
shown that the entropy does not behave monotonically, in general, and can even
decrease under the thermofield-dynamical one, in contrast to monotonic increase
under the other.

four models of control strategies for epidemics among the prey. In particular
to contain the transmissible disease, safety niches are considered, assuming
they lessen the disease spread, but do not protect prey from predators. This
represents a novelty with respect to standard ecosystems where the refuge
prevents predators' attacks. The niche is assumed either to protect the healthy
individuals, or to hinder the infected ones to get in contact with the
susceptibles, or finally to reduce altogether contacts that might lead to new
cases of the infection. In addition a standard culling procedure is also
analysed. The effectiveness of the different strategies are compared. Probably
the environments providing a place where disease carriers cannot come in
contact with the healthy individuals, or where their contact rates are lowered,
seem to preferable for disease containment.

addition to their radial surface density and velocity dispersion profiles. Our
results are compared with a parallel, self-consistent, analysis of empirical
data from THINGS (The HI Nearby Galaxy Survey). Single power-law fits
(P~k^gamma) to the power spectra of the stronger-feedback (MaGICC) runs (over
spatial scales corresponding to 0.5 kpc to 20 kpc) result in slopes consistent
with those seen in the THINGS sample (gamma = -2.5). The weaker-feedback (MUGS)
runs exhibit shallower power law slopes (gamma = -1.2). The power spectra of
the MaGICC simulations are more consistent though with a two-component fit,
with a flatter distribution of power on larger scales (i.e., gamma = -1.4 for
scales in excess of 2 kpc) and a steeper slope on scales below 1 kpc (gamma =
-5), qualitatively consistent with empirical claims, as well as our earlier
work on dwarf discs. The radial HI surface density profiles of the MaGICC discs
show a clear exponential behaviour, while those of the MUGS suite are
essentially flat; both behaviours are encountered in nature, although the
THINGS sample is more consistent with our stronger (MaGICC) feedback runs.

HD164492D. These observations indicated a strong longitudinal magnetic field of
about 500-600G in the poorly studied component HD164492C. To confirm this
detection, we used HARPS in spectropolarimetric mode on two consecutive nights
in 2013 June.
  Our HARPS observations confirmed the longitudinal magnetic field in
HD164492C. Furthermore, the HARPS observations revealed that HD164492C cannot
be considered as a single star as it possesses one or two companions. The
spectral appearance indicates that the primary is most likely of spectral type
B1-B1.5V. Since in both observing nights most spectral lines appear blended, it
is currently unclear which components are magnetic. Long-term monitoring using
high-resolution spectropolarimetry is necessary to separate the contribution of
each component to the magnetic signal. Given the location of the system
HD164492C in one of the youngest star formation regions, this system can be
considered as a Rosetta Stone for our understanding of the origin of magnetic
fields in massive stars.

relationship between the pseudogap, pairing and Fermi arcs in cuprates. High
quality data measured over a wide range of dopings reveals a consistent picture
of Fermiology and pairing in these materials. The pseudogap is due to an
ordered state that competes with superconductivity rather then preformed pairs.
Pairing does occur below Tpair~150K and significantly above Tc, but well below
T* and the doping dependence of this temperature scale is distinct from that of
the pseudogap. The d-wave gap is present below Tpair, and its interplay with
strong scattering creates ""artificial"" Fermi arcs for Tc<T<Tpair. However,
above Tpair, the pseudogap exists only at the antipodal region. This leads to
presence of real, gapless Fermi arcs close to the node. The length of these
arcs remains constant up to T*, where the full Fermi surface is recovered. We
demonstrate that these findings resolve a number of seemingly contradictory
scenarios.

services of the quality which meets customers' requirements. A cloud service

  We propose to model the energy consumption of private Clouds, which provides
virtual computation services, by a variant of the Bin Packing problem. This
novel generalization is obtained by introducing such constraints as: variable
bin size, cost of packing and the possibility of splitting items.
  We analyze the packing problem generalization from a theoretical point of
view. We advance on-line and off-line approximation algorithms to solve our
problem to balance the load either on-the-fly or on the planning stage. In
addition to the computation of the approximation factors of these two
algorithms, we evaluate experimentally their performance.
  The quality of the results is encouraging. This conclusion makes a packing

require manual intervention if one or more computing cores on which they
execute fail. This places not only a cost on the maintenance of the job, but
also a cost on the time taken for reinstating the job and the risk of losing
data and execution accomplished by the job before it failed. Approaches which
can proactively detect computing core failures and take action to relocate the
computing core's job onto reliable cores can make a significant step towards
automating fault tolerance.
  Method: This paper describes an experimental investigation into the use of
multi-agent approaches for fault tolerance. Two approaches are studied, the
first at the job level and the second at the core level. The approaches are
investigated for single core failure scenarios that can occur in the execution
of parallel reduction algorithms on computer clusters. A third approach is
proposed that incorporates multi-agent technology both at the job and core
level. Experiments are pursued in the context of genome searching, a popular
computational biology application.
  Result: The key conclusion is that the approaches proposed are feasible for
automating fault tolerance in high-performance computing systems with minimal
human intervention. In a typical experiment in which the fault tolerance is
studied, centralised and decentralised checkpointing approaches on an average
add 90% to the actual time for executing the job. On the other hand, in the
same experiment the multi-agent approaches add only 10% to the overall
execution time.

other observational evidence suggest there is a significant variation of the
dust-to-metals ratio with metallicity. As we demonstrate in this paper, a
simple star-dust scenario is problematic also in the sense that it requires
that destruction of dust in the interstellar medium (e.g., due to passage of
supernova shocks) must be highly inefficient. We suggest a model where stellar
dust production is indeed efficient, but where interstellar dust growth is
equally important and acts as a replenishment mechanism which can counteract
the effects of dust destruction. This model appears to resolve the seemingly
contradictive observations, given that the ratio of the effective (stellar)
dust and metal yields is not universal and thus may change from one environment
to another, depending on metallicity.

to overcome the effect of outliers, a convex relaxation of the Huber loss
function is applied so that by using iterative optimization techniques, good

the original (non-relaxed) Huber cost function is further optimized to obtain
refined location estimates based on those obtained in the first stage. In both
stages, a simple gradient descent technique is used to carry out the
optimization. Through simulations and real data analysis, it is shown that the
proposed convex relaxation generally achieves a lower root mean squared error
(RMSE) compared to other convex relaxation techniques in the literature. Also
by doing the second stage, the position estimates are improved and we can
achieve an RMSE close to that of the other distributed algorithms which know
\textit{a priori} which links are in NLOS.

mistrustful parties wish to generate a fair coin-flip by communicating with
each other. Chailloux and Kerenidis (2009) designed quantum protocols that
guarantee coin-flips with near optimal bias. The probability of any outcome in
these protocols is provably at most $1/\sqrt{2} + \delta$ for any given $\delta
> 0$. However, no explicit description of these protocols is known, and the
number of rounds in the protocols tends to infinity as $\delta$ goes to 0. In
fact, the smallest bias achieved by known explicit protocols is $1/4$
(Ambainis, 2001).
  We take a computational optimization approach, based mostly on convex
optimization, to the search for simple and explicit quantum strong
coin-flipping protocols. We present a search algorithm to identify protocols
with low bias within a natural class, protocols based on bit-commitment (Nayak
and Shor, 2003) restricting to commitment states used by Mochon (2005). An
analysis of the resulting protocols via semidefinite programs (SDPs) unveils a
simple structure. For example, we show that the SDPs reduce to second-order
cone programs. We devise novel cheating strategies in the protocol by
restricting the semidefinite programs and use the strategies to prune the
search.
  The techniques we develop enable a computational search for protocols given
by a mesh over the parameter space. The protocols have up to six rounds of
communication, with messages of varying dimension and include the best known
explicit protocol (with bias 1/4). We conduct two kinds of search: one for
protocols with bias below 0.2499, and one for protocols in the neighbourhood of
protocols with bias 1/4. Neither of these searches yields better bias. Based on
the mathematical ideas behind the search algorithm, we prove a lower bound on
the bias of a class of four-round protocols.

udpda and straight-line programs over the binary alphabet (SLPs). We show that
the characteristic sequence of any udpda can be represented as a pair of
SLPs---one for the prefix, one for the lasso---that have size linear in the

problems on udpda are reduced to decision problems on SLPs. Conversely, any SLP
can be converted in logarithmic space into a udpda, and this forms the basis

of experiment, involving imaging at multiple values of the parameter that
controls the sub-surface depth from which information about the density
structure is carried, to result in the image. Real-life material density
functions are characterised by high density contrasts and typically are highly
discontinuous, implying that they exhibit correlation structures that do not
vary smoothly. In the absence of training data, modelling such correlation
structures of real material density functions is not possible. So we discretise
the material sample and treat values of the density function at chosen
locations inside it as independent and distribution-free parameters. Resolution
of the available image dictates the discretisation length of the model; three
models pertaining to distinct resolution classes are developed. We develop
priors on the material density, such that these priors adapt to the sparsity
inherent in the density function. The likelihood is defined in terms of the
distance between the convolution of the unknown functions and the image data.
The posterior probability density of the unknowns given the data is expressed

Phys. Cond. Matter {\bf
16}, 8025 (2004)] approaches to quantum transport for the average current, the
entanglement entropy and the semiclassical full-counting statistics (FCS). Our
focus is on the applicability of these approaches to isolated quantum systems
such as ultra-cold atoms in engineered optical potentials. For two lattices
connected by a junction, we find that the current and particle number
fluctuations from the microcanonical approach compare well with the values
predicted by the Landauer formalism and FCS assuming a binomial distribution.
However, we demonstrate that well-defined reservoirs (i.e., particles in
Fermi-Dirac distributions) are not present for a substantial duration of the
quasi-steady state. Thus, the Landauer assumption of reservoirs and/or
inelastic effects is not necessary for establishing a quasi-steady state.
Maintaining such a state indefinitely requires an infinite system, and in this
limit well-defined Fermi-Dirac distributions can occur. A Kubo approach -- in
the spirit of the microcanonical picture -- bridges the gap between the two
formalisms, giving explicit analytical expressions for the formation of the
steady state. The microcanonical formalism is designed for closed, finite-size
quantum systems and is thus more suitable for studying particle dynamics in
ultra-cold atoms. Our results highlight both the connection and differences
with more traditional approaches to calculating transport properties in
condensed matter systems, and will help guide the way to their simulations in
cold-atom systems.

hormones control the metabolism of the body. Abnormalities of thyroid function
are usually related to production of too little thyroid hormone
(hypothyroidism) or production of too much thyroid hormone (hyperthyroidism).
Therefore, the correct diagnosis of these diseases is very important topic. In
this study, Linguistic Hedges Neural-Fuzzy Classifier with Selected Features
(LHNFCSF) is presented for diagnosis of thyroid diseases. The performance
evaluation of this system is estimated by using classification accuracy and
k-fold cross-validation. The results indicated that the classification accuracy
without feature selection was 98.6047% and 97.6744% during training and testing

In this study, five methods for coefficient estimation are compared, each of

prediction based on (1) a localized harmonic analysis involving 29 days of data
immediately preceding the tsunami event, (2) 68 pre-existing harmonic
constituents specific to each buoy, and (3) an empirical orthogonal function
fit to the previous 25 hrs of data. Method (4) is a Kalman smoother that uses
method (1) as its input. These four methods estimate source coefficients after
detiding. Method (5) estimates the coefficients simultaneously with a
two-component harmonic model that accounts for the tides. The five methods are
evaluated using archived data from eleven DART buoys, to which selected
artificial tsunami signals are superimposed. These buoys represent a full range
of observed tidal conditions and background BP noise in the Pacific and
Atlantic, and the artificial signals have a variety of patterns and induce
varying signal-to-noise ratios. The root-mean-square errors (RMSEs) of least
squares estimates of sources coefficients using varying amounts of data are
used to compare the five detiding methods. The RMSE varies over two orders of
magnitude between detiding methods, generally decreasing in the order listed,
with method (5) yielding the most accurate estimate of source coefficient. The
RMSE is substantially reduced by waiting for the first full wave of the tsunami
signal to arrive. As a case study, the five method are compared using data

analyzed. Based on the analysis of word usage, word usage frequency
distributions, and word class usage, among other things, Talking is also the
most similar to Twitter and IRC Chat. This suggests that communicating using
Twitter and IRC Chat evolved from Talking rather than Writing. When we
communicate online, even though we are writing, we do not Tweet or Chat how we
write books; we Tweet and Chat how we Speak. Nonfiction and Fiction writing
were clearly differentiable from our analysis with Twitter and Chat being much
more similar to Fiction than Nonfiction writing. These hypotheses were then
tested using author and journalists Cory Doctorow. Mr. Doctorow$\text{'}$s
Writing, Twitter usage, and Talking were all found to have very similar
vocabulary usage patterns as the amalgamized populations, as long as the
writing was Fiction. However, Mr. Doctorow$\text{'}$s Nonfiction writing is
different from 1-grams and other collected Nonfiction writings. This data could
perhaps be used to create more entertaining works of Nonfiction.

processes. Diseases occur when normal functionality of these processes is
disrupted. Thus, understanding these biochemical processes and their
interrelationships is a primary task in biomedical research and a prerequisite
for diagnosing diseases, and drug development. Scientists studying these
processes have identified various pathways responsible for drug metabolism, and
signal transduction, etc.
  Newer techniques and speed improvements have resulted in deeper knowledge
about these pathways, resulting in refined models that tend to be large and
complex, making it difficult for a person to remember all aspects of it. Thus,
computer models are needed to analyze them. We want to build such a system that
allows modeling of biological systems and pathways in such a way that we can
answer questions about them.
  Many existing models focus on structural and/or factoid questions, using
surface-level knowledge that does not require understanding the underlying
model. We believe these are not the kind of questions that a biologist may ask
someone to test their understanding of the biological processes. We want our
system to answer the kind of questions a biologist may ask. Such questions
appear in early college level text books.
  Thus the main goal of our thesis is to develop a system that allows us to
encode knowledge about biological pathways and answer such questions about them
demonstrating understanding of the pathway. To that end, we develop a language
that will allow posing such questions and illustrate the utility of our
framework with various applications in the biological domain. We use some
existing tools with modifications to accomplish our goal.
  Finally, we apply our system to real world applications by extracting pathway
knowledge from text and answering questions related to drug development.

structure allows the atomic spin-orbit coupling which lifts the degeneracy
between two sets of on-site Kramers doublets $j_z=\pm\frac{3}{2}$ and
$j_z=\pm\frac{1}{2}$. Because of the orbital angular momentum structure of
Bloch-wave states at $\Gamma$ and $K(K^\prime)$ points, topological gaps are
equal to the atomic spin-orbit coupling strengths, which are much larger than
those based on the mechanism of the $s$-$p$ band inversion. In the weak and
intermediate regime of spin-orbit coupling strength, topological gaps are the
global gap. The energy spectra and eigen wave functions are solved analytically
based on Clifford algebra. The competition among spin-orbit coupling $\lambda$,
sublattice asymmetry $m$ and the N\'eel exchange field $n$ results in band
crossings at $\Gamma$ and $K (K^\prime)$ points, which leads to various
topological band structure transitions. The quantum anomalous Hall state is

difficult challenge. Turbulence is amenable to analysis with linear theory if
it is subject to rapid distortions, i.e., motions occurring on a time scale
that is short compared to the time scale for non-linear interactions. Such an
approach could prove useful for understanding aspects of astrophysical
turbulence, which is often subject to rapid distortions, such as supernova
explosions or the free-fall associated with gravitational instability. As a
proof of principle, a particularly simple problem is considered here: the
evolution of vorticity due to a planar rarefaction in an ideal gas. Vorticity
can either grow or decay in the wake of a rarefaction front, and there are two
competing effects that determine which outcome occurs: entropy fluctuations
couple to the mean pressure gradient to produce vorticity via baroclinic
effects, whereas vorticity is damped due to the conservation of angular
momentum as the fluid expands. In the limit of purely entropic fluctuations in
the ambient fluid, a strong rarefaction generates vorticity with a turbulent
Mach number on the order of the root-mean square of the ambient entropy
fluctuations. The analytical results are shown to compare well with results
from two- and three-dimensional numerical simulations. Analytical solutions are
also derived in the linear regime of Reynolds-averaged turbulence models. This
highlights an inconsistency in standard turbulence models that prevents them
from accurately capturing the physics of rarefaction-turbulence interaction.
Finally, dimensional analysis of the equations indicates that rapid distortion
of turbulence can give rise to two distinct regimes in the turbulent spectrum:
a distortion range at large scales where linear distortion effects dominate,
and an inertial range at small scales where non-linear effects dominate.

candidate for tunable photodetection from the visible to the infrared part of
the spectrum. We study the photoresponse of field-effect transistors (FETs)
made of few-layer black phosphorus (3 nm to 8 nm thick), as a function of
excitation wavelength, power and frequency. In the dark state, the black
phosphorus FETs can be tuned both in hole and electron doping regimes allowing
for ambipolar operation. We measure mobilities in the order of 100 cm2/V s and
current ON/OFF ratio larger than 103. Upon illumination, the black phosphorus
transistors show response to excitation wavelengths from the visible up to 940
nm and rise time of about 1 ms, demonstrating broadband and fast detection. The
responsivity reaches 4.8 mA/W and it could be drastically enhanced by
engineering a detector based on a PN junction. The ambipolar behavior coupled

model the 2 lenses in terms of singular isothermal sphere profiles and derive
robust effective velocity dispersions of (97 +/- 3) and (240 +/- 6) km/s. The
total mass distribution of the cluster is also well characterized by using only
the local information contained in this lensing system, that is located at a
projected distance of more than 300 kpc from the cluster luminosity center.
According to our best-fitting lensing and composite stellar population models,
the source is magnified by a total factor of 50 and has a luminous mass of
about (1.0 +/- 0.5) x 10^{9} M_{Sun}. By combining the total and luminous mass
estimates of the 2 lenses, we measure luminous over total mass fractions
projected within the effective radii of 0.51 +/- 0.21 and 0.80 +/- 0.32. With
these lenses we can extend the analysis of the mass properties of lens
early-type galaxies by factors that are about 2 and 3 times smaller than
previously done with regard to, respectively, velocity dispersion and luminous
mass. The comparison of the total and luminous quantities of our lenses with
those of astrophysical objects with different physical scales reveals the
potential of studies of this kind for investigating the internal structure of
galaxies. These studies, made possible thanks to the CLASH survey, will allow
us to go beyond the current limits posed by the available lens samples in the

shocks) and a radiation zone (the plasma downstream the shocks). The
acceleration in the shocks, which is an unavoidable consequence of the
efficient proton acceleration, requires efficient transport from the radiation
back to the acceleration zone. On the other hand, stochastic acceleration in
the radiation zone can enhance the secondary spectra of muons and kaons
significantly if there is a sufficiently large turbulent region. Overall, it is
plausible that neutrino spectra can be enhanced by up to a factor of two at the
peak by stochastic acceleration, that an additional spectral peaks appears from
shock acceleration of the secondary muons and pions, and that the neutrino
production from kaon decays is enhanced. Depending on the GRB parameters, the
general conclusions concerning the limits to the internal shock scenario
obtained by recent IceCube and ANTARES analyses may be affected by up to a
factor of two by secondary acceleration. Most of the changes occur at energies
above 10^7 GeV, so the effects for next-generation radio-detection experiments
will be more pronounced. In the future, however, if GRBs are detected as
high-energy neutrino sources, the detection of one or several pronounced peaks

quantum spin liquid in the kagome lattice spin-1/2 Heisenberg model. A special
feature of spin liquids is that symmetries can be fractionalized, and different
patterns of symmetry fractionalization imply distinct phases. The symmetry
fractionalization pattern for the kagome spin liquid remains to be determined.
A popular approach to studying spin liquids is to decompose the physical spin
into partons obeying either bose (Schwinger bosons) or fermi (Abrikosov
fermions) statstics, which are then treated within the mean-field theory. A
longstanding question has been whether these two approaches are truly distinct,
or describe the same phase in complementary ways. Here we show that all 8 $Z_2$
spin liquid phases in Schwinger-boson mean-field (SBMF) construction can also
be described in terms of Abrikosov fermions, unifying pairs of theories that
seem rather distinct. The key idea is that for $Z_2$ spin liquid states that
admit a SBMF description on kagome lattice, the symmetry fractionalization of
visions is uniquely fixed. Two promising candidate states for kagome Heisenberg
model, Sachdev's $Q_{1}=Q_{2}$ SBMF state and Lu-Ran-Lee's $Z_2[0,\pi]\beta$
Abrikosov fermion state, are found to describe the same symmetric spin liquid
phase. We expect these results to aid in a complete specification of the
numerically observed spin liquid phase. We also discuss a set of $Z_2$ spin
liquid phases in fermionic parton approach, where spin rotation and lattice
symmetries protect gapless edge states, that do not admit a SBMF description.

the sort that has potentially been observed. Such a disk is motivated by a
novel dark matter component with dissipative cooling that we considered in
earlier work. We show how to evaluate the statistical evidence for periodicity
by input of appropriate measured priors from the galactic model, justifying or
ruling out periodic cratering with more confidence than by evaluating the data
without an underlying model. We find that, marginalizing over astrophysical
uncertainties, the likelihood ratio for such a model relative to one with a
constant cratering rate is 3.0, which moderately favors the dark disk model.
Our analysis furthermore yields a posterior distribution that, based on current
crater data, singles out a dark matter disk surface density of approximately 10
solar masses per square parsec. The geological record thereby motivates a
particular model of dark matter that will be probed in the near future.

$\nu=1/2$ state very accurately, we compute the second R\'enyi entropy using
variational Monte-Carlo technique and an efficient parallel algorithm. We find
the entanglement entropy scales as $L\log L$ with the length of the boundary
$L$ as it does for free fermions, albeit with a pre-factor twice that of the
free fermion. We contrast the results against theoretical conjectures and
discuss the implications of the results.

Inside the ring, the spacetime is pure anti-de Sitter (AdS), whereas outside it

The first law of thermodynamics applied to the thin shell, plus one equation of
state for the shell's pressure and another for its temperature, leads to a
shell's entropy, which is a function of its gravitational radius alone. A
simple example for this gravitational entropy, namely, a power law in the
gravitational radius, is given. The equations of thermodynamic stability are
analyzed, resulting in certain allowed regions for the parameters entering the

pushed up to its own gravitational radius, there is a finite quantum
backreaction that does not destroy the shell. One then finds that the entropy
of the shell at the shell's gravitational radius is given by the
Bekenstein-Hawking entropy.

prestellar core formation in turbulent giant molecular clouds (GMCs), using
three-dimensional numerical simulations. Our simulations focus on the shocked
layer produced by a converging flow within a GMC, and survey varying ionization
and angle between the upstream flow and magnetic field. We also include ideal
magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) and hydrodynamic models. From our simulations, we
identify hundreds of self-gravitating cores that form within 1 Myr, with masses
M ~ 0.04 - 2.5 solar-mass and sizes L ~ 0.015 - 0.07 pc, consistent with
observations of the peak of the core mass function (CMF). Median values are M =
0.47 solar-mass and L = 0.03 pc. Core masses and sizes do not depend on either
the ionization or upstream magnetic field direction. In contrast, the
mass-to-magnetic flux ratio does increase with lower ionization, from twice to
four times the critical value. The higher mass-to-flux ratio for low ionization
is the result of enhanced transient ambipolar diffusion when the shocked layer
first forms. However, ambipolar diffusion is not necessary to form low-mass
supercritical cores. For ideal MHD, we find similar masses to other cases.
These masses are 1 - 2 orders of magnitude lower than the value that defines a
magnetically supercritical sphere under post-shock ambient conditions. This
discrepancy is the result of anisotropic contraction along field lines, which
is clearly evident in both ideal MHD and diffusive simulations. We interpret
our numerical findings using a simple scaling argument which suggests that
gravitationally critical core masses will depend on the sound speed and mean
turbulent pressure in a cloud, regardless of magnetic effects.

to a model in which the primary star's obliquity is $\approx65^{\circ}$, and
its spin axis precesses around the total angular momentum vector with a period

although a significant obliquity is also implicated by the observed time
variations in the $v \sin i_{\star}$. By integrating the secular tidal

brightness profile) or spectrally (by analyzing the spectrum at various
locations in the field). Both techniques have advantages and disadvantages, and
when the emission becomes particularly faint and/or extended, the two methods
can disagree. We argue that an ideal approach would be to model the events file
directly, and therefore to use both the spectral and spatial information which
are simultaneously available for each event. In this work we propose a first
step in this direction, introducing a method for spatial analysis which can be
extended to leverage spectral information simultaneously. We construct a model
for the entire X-ray image in a given energy band, and generate a likelihood
function to compare the model to the data. A critical goal of this modeling is
disentangling vignetted and unvignetted backgrounds through their different
spatial distributions. Employing either maximum likelihood or Markov Chain
Monte Carlo, we can derive probability distribution functions for the source
and background parameters together, or we can fit and subtract the background,
leaving the description of the source non-parametric. We calibrate and
demonstrate this method against a variety of simulated images, and then apply
it to Chandra observations of the hot gaseous halo around the elliptical galaxy
NGC 720. We are able to follow the X-ray emission below a tenth of the
background, and to infer a hot gas mass within 35 kpc of 4-5x10^9 Msun, with
some indication that the profile continues to at least 50 kpc and that it
steepens as the radius increases. We derive much stronger constraints on the
surface brightness profile than previous studies, which employed the spectral
method, and we show that the density profiles inferred from these studies are
in conflict with the observed surface brightness profile. (abridged)

and vertical velocities are expected to be zero everywhere. In recent years,
various large spectroscopic surveys have however shown that stars of the Milky

the Galactocentric radial and vertical velocity components. While radial
velocity structures are commonly assumed to be associated with non-axisymmetric
components of the potential such as spiral arms or bars, non-zero vertical

such as a passing satellite galaxy or a small dark matter substructure crossing
the Galactic disc. Here, we use a three-dimensional test-particle simulation to
show that the global stellar response to a spiral perturbation induces both a
radial velocity flow and non-zero vertical motions. The resulting structure of
the mean velocity field is qualitatively similar to what is observed across the
Milky Way disc. We show that such a pattern also naturally emerges from an
analytic toy model based on linearized Euler equations. We conclude that an
external perturbation of the disc might not be a requirement to explain all of
the observed structures in the vertical velocity of stars across the Galactic

luminosity is dominated by a very massive central galaxy. In the current cold
dark matter scenario, these objects formed hierarchically at an early epoch of
the Universe and then slowly evolved until present day. That is the reason why
they are called {\it fossils}. We started an extensive observational program to
characterize a sample of 34 fossil group candidates spanning a broad range of
physical properties. Deep $r-$band images were taken for each candidate and
optical spectroscopic observations were obtained for $\sim$ 1200 galaxies. This
new dataset was completed with SDSS DR7 archival data to obtain robust cluster
membership and global properties of each fossil group candidate. For each
system, we recomputed the magnitude gaps between the two brightest galaxies
($\Delta m_{12}$) and the first and fourth ranked galaxies ($\Delta m_{14}$)
within 0.5 $R_{{\rm 200}}$. We consider fossil systems those with $\Delta
m_{12} \ge 2$ mag or $\Delta m_{14} \ge 2.5$ mag within the errors. We find
that 15 candidates turned out to be fossil systems. Their observational
properties agree with those of non-fossil systems. Both follow the same
correlations, but fossils are always extreme cases. In particular, they host
the brightest central galaxies and the fraction of total galaxy light enclosed
in the central galaxy is larger in fossil than in non-fossil systems. Finally,
we confirm the existence of genuine fossil clusters. Combining our results with
others in the literature, we favor the merging scenario in which fossil systems
formed due to mergers of $L^\ast$ galaxies. The large magnitude gap is a
consequence of the extreme merger ratio within fossil systems and therefore it
is an evolutionary effect. Moreover, we suggest that at least one candidate in
our sample could represent a transitional fossil stage.

span the same redshift range 0<z<0.5 and have the same Lx distribution. For
each fossil system, the Lx in the 0.1-2.4 keV band is computed using data from
the ROSAT All Sky Survey. For each fossil and normal system we homogeneously
compute Lopt in the r-band within the characteristic cluster radius, using data
from the SDSS DR7. We sample the Lx-Lopt relation over two orders of magnitude

distinguishable from the normal systems both through the 2D KS test and the fit

strongly correlate with the X-ray luminosity of the hot gas component,

hard band (above 2.5 keV) power density spectra consist of band-limited noise
and quasi-periodic oscillations, corresponding to the power spectral shape seen
in the hard or intermediate state, while in the soft band the averaged power
density spectrum is consistent with a power-law noise, corresponding to the
power spectral shape usually seen in the soft state. The coexisting of two
different power spectral shapes in the soft and hard band, where the soft band
power spectrum is dominated by a power-law noise, is consistent with MAXI
J1659-152, and confirms the energy dependence of power spectral states. Our
additional spectral analysis shows that the disc component does contribute to
the soft band flux. These findings support that the observed black hole power
spectral state depends on which spectral component we are looking at, which
implies that power spectral analysis is probably a more sensitive method than

for the high order finite difference Runge-Kutta weighted essentially
non-oscillatory (WENO) scheme solving compressible Euler equations to maintain
positive density and pressure. Negative density and pressure, which often leads
to simulation blow-ups or nonphysical solutions, emerges from many high
resolution computations in some extreme cases. The methodology we propose in
this paper is a nontrivial generalization of the parametrized maximum principle
preserving flux limiters for high order finite difference schemes solving
scalar hyperbolic conservation laws [22, 10, 20]. To preserve the maximum
principle, the high order flux is limited towards a first order monotone flux,
where the limiting procedures are designed by decoupling linear maximum
principle constraints. High order schemes with such flux limiters are shown to
preserve the high order accuracy via local truncation error analysis and by
extensive numerical experiments with mild CFL constraints. The parametrized
flux limiting approach is generalized to the Euler system to preserve the
positivity of density and pressure of numerical solutions via decoupling some
nonlinear constraints. Compared with existing high order positivity preserving
approaches [24, 26, 25], our proposed algorithm is positivity preserving by the
design; it is computationally efficient and maintains high order spatial and
temporal accuracy in our extensive numerical tests. Numerical tests are
performed to demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed new

Y=0.252+-0.003 (sigma=0.021) for M30 and Y=0.241+-0.004 (sigma=0.023) NGC6397.
These values are fully compatible with the cosmological abundance, thus
suggesting that the horizontal branch stars are not strongly enriched in He.
The small spread of the Y distributions are compatible with those expected from
the observed main sequence splitting. Finally, we find an hint of a weak

contains normalized frequencies of occurrence of certain motifs or sub-graphs.
This vector representation can be used in a variety of applications, such as,
for computing similarity between graphs. The graphlet kernel of Shervashidze et
al. [32] uses induced sub-graphs of k nodes (christened as graphlets by Przulj
[28]) as motifs in the vector representation, and computes the kernel via a dot
product between these vectors. One can easily show that this is a valid kernel
between graphs. However, such a vector representation suffers from a few
drawbacks. As k becomes larger we encounter the sparsity problem; most higher
order graphlets will not occur in a given graph. This leads to diagonal
dominance, that is, a given graph is similar to itself but not to any other
graph in the dataset. On the other hand, since lower order graphlets tend to be
more numerous, using lower values of k does not provide enough discrimination
ability. We propose a smoothing technique to tackle the above problems. Our
method is based on a novel extension of Kneser-Ney and Pitman-Yor smoothing
techniques from natural language processing to graphs. We use the relationships
between lower order and higher order graphlets in order to derive our method.
Consequently, our smoothing algorithm not only respects the dependency between
sub-graphs but also tackles the diagonal dominance problem by distributing the
probability mass across graphlets. In our experiments, the smoothed graphlet
kernel outperforms graph kernels based on raw frequency counts.

conservative and non- conservative dislocation creation mechanisms in

mechanisms involving closed dislocation loops or grain boundaries as well as
Bardeen-Herring-type climb mechanisms involving precipitates, inclusions,

the atomistic level by PFC de- scriptions, with arbitrarily complex defect
configurations, types, and environments. An unexpected dipole-to-quadrupole
source transformation is identified, as well as various new and complex geomet-
rical features of loop nucleation via climb from spherical particles. Results
for the strain required to nucleate a dislocation loop from such a particle are
in agreement with analytic continuum theories. Other basic features of FCC and
BCC dislocation structure and dynamics are also outlined, and initial results
for dislocation-stacking fault tetrahedron interactions are presented. These
findings together highlight various capabilities of the PFC approach as a
coarse-grained atomistic tool for the study of three-dimensional crystal
plasticity.

local computations and then communicate in order to aggregate information and
synchronize their decision variables. Synchronization is accomplished through
the use of a distributed averaging protocol. When an exact distributed
averaging protocol is used, it is known that the optimal regret bound of
$\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{m})$ can be achieved using the distributed mini-batch
algorithm of Dekel et al. (2012), where $m$ is the total number of samples
processed across the network. We focus on methods using approximate distributed
averaging protocols and show that the optimal regret bound can also be achieved
in this setting. In particular, we propose a gossip-based optimization method
which achieves the optimal regret bound. The amount of communication required
depends on the network topology through the second largest eigenvalue of the
transition matrix of a random walk on the network. In the setting of stochastic
optimization, the proposed gossip-based approach achieves nearly-linear
scaling: the optimization error is guaranteed to be no more than $\epsilon$
after $\mathcal{O}(\frac{1}{n \epsilon^2})$ rounds, each of which involves
$\mathcal{O}(\log n)$ gossip iterations, when nodes communicate over a
well-connected graph. This scaling law is also observed in numerical

These equations contain unknown parameters, say $\theta$ of physical

closed form analytic solution of the equations and hence we cannot use the
usual non-linear least squares technique to estimate the unknown parameters.
There is a two step approach to solve this problem, where the first step
involves fitting the data nonparametrically. In the second step the parameter
is estimated by minimizing the distance between the nonparametrically estimated
derivative and the derivative suggested by the system of ODEs. The statistical
aspects of this approach have been studied under the frequentist framework. We
consider this two step estimation under the Bayesian framework. The response

that observations within two consecutive change points follow the same
distribution. We propose two different methods based on likelihood ratio test
and cluster analysis to detect multiple change points when observations follow
non-stationary Poisson process with diverse occurrence rates over time. Results
from a comprehensive Monte Carlo study indicate satisfactory performance for
the proposed methods. A well-known example is also considered to show the
application of our findings in real world cases.

representing part-whole and topological relations. It plays an important role
in qualitative spatial reasoning, geographical information science, and
ontology. The computational complexity of reasoning with RCC5 and RCC8 (two
fragments of RCC) as well as other qualitative spatial/temporal calculi has
been investigated in depth in the literature. Most of these works focus on the
consistency of qualitative constraint networks. In this paper, we consider the
important problem of redundant qualitative constraints. For a set $\Gamma$ of
qualitative constraints, we say a constraint $(x R y)$ in $\Gamma$ is redundant
if it is entailed by the rest of $\Gamma$. A prime subnetwork of $\Gamma$ is a
subset of $\Gamma$ which contains no redundant constraints and has the same
solution set as $\Gamma$. It is natural to ask how to compute such a prime
subnetwork, and when it is unique.
  In this paper, we show that this problem is in general intractable, but
becomes tractable if $\Gamma$ is over a tractable subalgebra $\mathcal{S}$ of a
qualitative calculus. Furthermore, if $\mathcal{S}$ is a subalgebra of RCC5 or
RCC8 in which weak composition distributes over nonempty intersections, then
$\Gamma$ has a unique prime subnetwork, which can be obtained in cubic time by
removing all redundant constraints simultaneously from $\Gamma$. As a
byproduct, we show that any path-consistent network over such a distributive
subalgebra is weakly globally consistent and minimal. A thorough empirical
analysis of the prime subnetwork upon real geographical data sets demonstrates
the approach is able to identify significantly more redundant constraints than
previously proposed algorithms, especially in constraint networks with larger
proportions of partial overlap relations.

optical and near-IR photometry. While we definitely find YSOs in the Bridge,
the most massive are $\sim10 M_\odot$, $\ll45 M_\odot$ found in the Large
Magellanic Cloud (LMC). The intensity of MSF in the Bridge also appears
decreasing, as the most massive YSOs are less massive than those formed in the
past. To investigate environmental effects on MSF, we have compared properties
of massive YSOs in the Bridge to those in the LMC. First, YSOs in the Bridge
are apparently less embedded than in the LMC: 81% of Bridge YSOs show optical
counterparts, compared to only 56% of LMC sources with the same range of mass,
circumstellar dust mass, and line-of-sight extinction. Circumstellar envelopes
are evidently more porous or clumpy in the Bridge's low-metallicity
environment. Second, we have used whole samples of YSOs in the LMC and the
Bridge to estimate the probability of finding YSOs at a given \hi\ column
density, N(HI). We found that the LMC has $\sim3\times$ higher probability than
the Bridge for N(HI) $>10\times10^{20}$ cm$^{-2}$, but the trend reverses at
lower N(HI). Investigating whether this lower efficiency relative to HI is due
to less efficient molecular cloud formation, or less efficient cloud collapse,

with neural networks which is essentially a black box modelling approach. This
additional flexibility is an advantage from the modelling perspective and helps
to discern the important variables which affect the prediction. Due to the
evolutionary nature of the algorithm, it is able to get out of local minima and
converge to a global optimum unlike the back-propagation (BP) algorithm used
for training neural networks. This results in a better percentage fit than the
ones obtained using neural networks by contemporary researchers. Also a
hold-out cross validation is done on the obtained genetic programming (GP)
results which show that the results generalize well to new data and do not
over-fit the training samples. The multi-gene GP results are compared with
those, obtained using its single-gene version and also the same with four

observes that the admissible range here for these tuples $(p_1,p_2,p)$ is a
proper subset contained in the admissible range of BHT.

range for the bilinear and multi-parameter Hilbert transforms with arbitrary

also establish the same $L^p$ estimates as BHT for certain modified bilinear

made within the ATLAS3D project, and follow-up spectroscopic observations with
the Gemini-North telescope, we have discovered old TDG candidates around
several early-type galaxies. At least one of them has an oxygen abundance close
to solar, as expected for a tidal origin. This confirmed pre-enriched object is
located within the gigantic, but very low surface brightness, tidal tail that
emanates from the elliptical galaxy, NGC 5557. An age of 4 Gyr estimated from
its SED fitting makes it the oldest securely identified TDG ever found so far.
We investigated the structural and gaseous properties of the TDG and of a
companion located in the same collisional debris, and thus most likely of tidal
origin as well. Despite several Gyr of evolution close to their parent
galaxies, they kept a large gas reservoir. Their central surface brightness is
low and their effective radius much larger than that of typical dwarf galaxies
of the same mass. This possibly provides us with criteria to identify tidal
objects which can be more easily checked than the traditional ones requiring
deep spectroscopic observations. In view of the above, we discuss the survival
time of TDGs and question the tidal origin of the DoSs.

indicated that the pathogen has adapted to WNS-afflicted habitats. Further,
this study supports the hypothesis that Pd is an introduced species. These

transportation systems, resulting in delays and poor levels of service.
Billions of spatiotemporal call detail records (CDRs) collected from mobile
devices create new opportunities to quantify and solve these problems. However,
there is a need for tools to map new data onto existing transportation
infrastructure. In this work, we propose a system that leverages this data to
identify patterns in road usage. First, we develop an algorithm to mine
billions of calls and learn location transition probabilities of callers. These
transition probabilities are then upscaled with demographic data to estimate
origin-destination (OD) flows of residents between any two intersections of a
city. Next, we implement a distributed incremental traffic assignment algorithm
to route these flows on road networks and estimate congestion and level of
service for each roadway. From this assignment, we construct a bipartite usage
network by connecting census tracts to the roads used by their inhabitants.
Comparing the topologies of the physical road network and bipartite usage
network allows us to classify each road's role in a city's transportation
network and detect causes of local bottlenecks. Finally, we demonstrate an
interactive, web-based visualization platform that allows researchers,
policymakers, and drivers to explore road congestion and usage in a new
dimension. To demonstrate the flexibility of this system, we perform these
analyses in multiple cities across the globe with diverse geographical and
sociodemographic qualities. This platform provides a foundation to build
congestion mitigation solutions and generate new insights into urban mobility.

ultradian oscillations in blood glucose concentration, an important element of
a healthy alimentary system. Building upon recent successes in mathematical
modeling of the human glucose-insulin system, we show that both food intake and
insulin therapy likely demand increasingly precise control over insulin
sensitivity if oscillations at a healthy average glucose concentration are to
be maintained. We then suggest guidelines and personalized treatment options
for diabetic patients that maintain these oscillations. We show that for a type
II diabetic, both blood glucose levels can be controlled and healthy
oscillations maintained when the patient gets an hour of daily exercise and is
placed on a combination of Metformin and sulfonylurea drugs. We note that
insulin therapy and an additional hour of exercise will reduce the patient's
need for sulfonylureas. Results of a modeling analysis suggest that a typical
type I diabetic's blood glucose levels can be properly controlled with a
constant insulin infusion between 0.45 and 0.7 microU/(ml*min). Lastly, we note
that all suggested strategies rely on existing clinical techniques and
established treatment measures, and so could potentially be of immediate use in

such a binding in physical systems typically relies on the microscopic details

s-wave scattering length and the spin-orbit coupling strength. We show that the
occurrence of this universal Borromean binding is facilitated by the symmetry
of the single-particle dispersion under spin-orbit coupling, and is therefore
{\it symmetry-selective} rather than interaction-selective. The state is robust
over a wide range of mass ratio between composing fermions, which are
accessible by Li-Li, K-K and K-Li mixtures in cold atoms experiments. Our
results reveal the importance of symmetry factor in few-body physics, and shed

frequency is identical to the SSA turnover frequency. As a first step, we
assume the radio core as a simple uniform sphere geometry. Using the observed
angular size of the radio core measured by the Very Long Baseline Array at 43
GHz, we estimate the energy densities of magnetic field ($U_{B}$) and
relativistic electrons ($U_{e}$) based on the standard SSA formula. Imposing
the condition that the Poynting power and relativistic electron one should be
smaller than the total power of the jet, we find that (i) the allowed range of
the magnetic field strength ($B_{tot}$) is from 1 G to 15 G, and that (ii) $1
times 10^{-5} < U_{e}/U_{B} < 6 times 10^{2}$ holds. The uncertainty of
$U_{e}/U_{B}$ comes from the strong dependence on the angular size of the radio
core and the minimum Lorentz factor of non-thermal electrons ($gamma_{e,min}$)
in the core. It is still open that the resultant energetics is consistent with

raised to a high value exceeding 10$^{8}$K immediately after outburst
commencement. The energetics of the outburst clearly surpass those of similar
symbiotic systems like RS Oph and V407 Cyg which have giant secondaries. The
shock does not show a free-expansion stage but rather shows a decelerative
Sedov-Taylor phase from the beginning. Such strong shockfronts are known to be

restricted to only symbiotic systems with a shocked red giant (RG) wind. The
lack of a free-expansion stage favors V745 Sco to have a density enhancement

their host star's equator. We discuss the mechanisms which could drive planets
into spin-orbit misalignment. The most commonly proposed being the Kozai
mechanism, which requires the presence of a distant, massive companion to the
star-planet system. We therefore describe a volume-limited direct-imaging
survey of Hot Jupiter systems with measured spin-orbit angles, to search for
the presence of stellar companions and test the Kozai hypothesis.

we study the mechanical and radiative feedback effects from the central AGN on
the cosmological evolution of an isolated elliptical galaxy. Physical processes
such as star formation and supernovae are considered. The inner boundary of the
simulation domain is carefully chosen so that the fiducial Bondi radius is
resolved and the accretion rate of the black hole is determined
self-consistently. In analogy to previous works, we assume that the specific
angular momentum of the galaxy is low. It is well-known that when the accretion
rates are high and low, the central AGNs will be in cold and hot accretion
modes, which correspond to the radiative and kinetic feedback modes,
respectively. The emitted spectrum from the hot accretion flows is harder than
that from the cold accretion flows, which could result in a higher Compton
temperature accompanied by a more efficient radiative heating, according to
previous theoretical works. Such a difference of the Compton temperature
between the two feedback modes, the focus of this study, has been neglected in
previous works. Significant differences in the kinetic feedback mode are found
as a result of the stronger Compton heating and accretion becomes more chaotic.
More importantly, if we constrain models to correctly predict black hole growth
and AGN duty cycle after cosmological evolution, we find that the favored model
parameters are constrained: mechanical feedback efficiency diminishes with
decreasing luminosity (the maximum efficiency being $\simeq 10^{-3.5}$) and
X-ray Compton temperature increases with decreasing luminosity, although models
with fixed mechanical efficiency and Compton temperature can be found that are
satisfactory as well. We conclude that radiative feedback in the kinetic mode
is much more important than previously thought.

  arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:1402.6666",,,,"stat.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Recently the patient centered medical home (PCMH) model has become a popular
approach to deliver better care to patients. Current research shows that the
most important key for succession of this method is to make balance between
healthcare supply and demand. Without such balance in clinical supply and
demand, issues such as excessive under and over utilization of physicians, long
waiting time for receiving the appropriate treatment, and non continuity of
care will eliminate many advantages of the medical home strategy. To reach this
end we need to have information about both supply and demand in healthcare
system. Healthcare supply can be calculated easily based on head counts and
available hours which is offered by professionals for a specific time period
while healthcare demand is not easy to calculate, and it is affected by some
healthcare, diagnostic and demographic attributes. In this paper, by extending
the hierarchical generalized linear model to include multivariate responses, we
develop a clinical workload prediction model for care portfolio demands in a
Bayesian framework. Our analyses of a recent data from Veteran Health
Administration indicate that our prediction model works for clinical data with
high performance.

extraordinarily powerful gravitational-wave sources, detectable to redshifts of

about the evolution of massive stars preclude definitive rate predictions for
mergers of these massive black holes. We show that rates as high as hundreds of
detections per year, or as low as no detections whatsoever, are both possible.
It was thought that the only way to produce these massive binaries was via
dynamical interactions in dense stellar systems. This view has been challenged
by the recent discovery of several stars with mass above 150 Msun in the R136
region of the Large Magellanic Cloud. Current models predict that when stars of
this mass leave the main sequence, their expansion is insufficient to allow
common envelope evolution to efficiently reduce the orbital separation. The
resulting black-hole--black-hole binary remains too wide to be able to coalesce
within a Hubble time. If this assessment is correct, isolated very massive
binaries do not evolve to be gravitational-wave sources. However, other
formation channels exist. For example, the high multiplicity of massive stars,
and their common formation in relatively dense stellar associations, opens up
dynamical channels for massive black hole mergers (e.g., via Kozai cycles or
repeated binary-single interactions). We identify key physical factors that
shape the population of very massive black-hole--black-hole binaries. Advanced
gravitational-wave detectors will provide important constraints on the
formation and evolution of very massive stars.

The MRoI maps and histograms inferred from the SDO/HMI magnetograms primarily
exhibit four scales: a scale of a few megameters that can be associated with

super-granulation, a scale of many hundreds to thousands of megameters that can

Quantum dot systems, which offer the sharpest density of states achievable,

displaying high power outputs, offer very low efficiencies. Here, we analyze
the use of a resonant tunneling diode structure that combines the best of both

confinement that aids the efficiency and a large number of current carrying
transverse modes that enhances the total power output. We show that this device
can achieve a high power output ($\sim 0.3$ MW$/m^2$) at efficiencies of $\sim
40\%$ of the Carnot efficiency due to the contribution from these transverse
momentum states at a finite bandwidth of $kT/2$. We then provide a detailed
analysis of the physics of charge and heat transport with insights on parasitic
currents that reduce the efficiency. Finally, a comparison between the resonant

a similar performance requires ultra-dense areal quantum dot densities of $\sim

confined to a box in two dimensions. For small rotational diffusion rates,
monodisperse disks spontaneously accumulate at the walls. At low densities,
interaction forces between particles are strongly inhomogeneous, and a simple
model predicts how these inhomogeneities alter the equation of state. At higher
densities, collective effects become important. We observe signatures of a
jamming transition at a packing fraction $\phi \sim 0.88$, which is also the
jamming point for non-active athermal monodisperse disks. At this $\phi$, the
system develops a critical finite active speed necessary for wall aggregation.
At packing fractions above $\phi \sim 0.6$, the pressure decreases with
increasing density, suggesting that strong interactions between particles are
affecting the equation of state well below the jamming transition. A mixture of
bidisperse disks segregates in the absence of any adhesion, identifying a new
mechanism that could contribute to cell sorting in embryonic development.

applications in image and video analysis are better modelled via non-Euclidean
manifold geometry. To this end, recent approaches represent images as
covariance matrices, and interpret such matrices as points on Riemannian
manifolds. As direct classification on such manifolds can be difficult, in this
paper we propose to represent each manifold point as a vector of similarities
to class representers, via a recently introduced form of Bregman matrix
divergence known as the Stein divergence. This is followed by using a
discriminative mapping of similarity vectors for final classification. The use
of similarity vectors is in contrast to the traditional approach of embedding
manifolds into tangent spaces, which can suffer from representing the manifold
structure inaccurately. Comparative evaluations on benchmark ETHZ and iLIDS

obtains better performance than recent techniques such as Histogram Plus
Epitome, Partial Least Squares, and Symmetry-Driven Accumulation of Local

into account manifold geometry is typically done via (1) embedding the
manifolds in tangent spaces, or (2) embedding into Reproducing Kernel Hilbert

Euclidean-based learning algorithms, manifold shape is only approximated which
can cause loss of discriminatory information. The RKHS approach retains more of
the manifold structure, but may require non-trivial effort to kernelise
Euclidean-based learning algorithms. In contrast to the above approaches, in
this paper we offer a novel solution that allows SPD matrices to be used with
unmodified Euclidean-based learning algorithms, with the true manifold shape
well-preserved. Specifically, we propose to project SPD matrices using a set of
random projection hyperplanes over RKHS into a random projection space, which
leads to representing each matrix as a vector of projection coefficients.
Experiments on face recognition, person re-identification and texture

are detected when the spacecraft is immersed in an ICME. The correlation of the
peak particle intensity with the projected speed of the SEP-associated coronal
mass ejection is similar in the two IMF categories of proton and electron
events, $\approx 0.6$. The SEP events within ICMEs show stronger correlation
between the peak proton intensity and the soft X-ray flux of the associated
solar flare, with correlation coefficient $r=\,$0.67$\pm$0.13, compared to the
SEP events propagating in the standard solar wind, $r=\,$0.36$\pm$0.13. The
difference is more pronounced for near-relativistic electrons. The main reason
for the different correlation behavior seems to be the larger spread of the
flare longitude in the SEP sample detected in the solar wind as compared to SEP
events within ICMEs. We discuss to which extent observational bias, different
physical processes (particle injection, transport, etc.), and the IMF

flows along helical threads, tracking out the twisted flux rope structure. The
length of the flux rope is about 75 Mm, the average width of its individual
threads is 1.11 Mm, and the estimated twist is 1$\pi$. The flux rope appears as
a dark structure in H$\alpha$ images, a partial dark and partial bright

the filament is confined within the flux rope and does not erupt successfully.

constraints on time consistency of efficiency for convex cone constrained
markets. More specifically, we derive the semi-analytical expressions for the
pre-committed efficient mean-variance policy and the minimum-variance signed
supermartingale measure (VSSM) and reveal their close relationship. Our
analysis shows that the pre-committed discrete-time efficient mean-variance
policy satisfies TCIE if and only if the conditional expectation of VSSM's
density (with respect to the original probability measure) is nonnegative, or
once the conditional expectation becomes negative, it remains at the same
negative value until the terminal time. Our findings indicate that the property
of time consistency in efficiency only depends on the basic market setting,
including portfolio constraints, and this fact motivates us to establish a
general solution framework in constructing TCIE dynamic portfolio selection
problem formulations by introducing suitable portfolio constraints.

the massive eclipsing binary Y Cyg represents one of the cornestones to

determination of the basic physical properties is less accurate than it could
be given the existing number of spectral and photometric observations. Our goal
is to analyze all these data simultaneously with the new dedicated series of
our own spectral and photometric observations from observatories widely
separated in longitude. We obtained new series of UBV observations at three
observatories separated in local time to obtain complete light curves of Y Cyg
for its orbital period close to 3 days. This new photometry was reduced and
carefully transformed to the standard UBV system using the HEC22 program. We
also obtained new series of red spectra secured at two observatories and
re-analyzed earlier obtained blue electronic spectra. Our analyses provide the
most accurate so far published value of the apsidal period of 47.805 +/- 0.030
yrs and the following physical elements: M1=17.72+/-0.35$ Msun, M2=17.73+/-0.30
Msun, R1=5.785+/-0.091 Rsun, and R2=5.816+/-0.063 Rsun. The disentangling thus
resulted in the masses, which are somewhat higher than all previous
determinations and virtually the same for both stars, while the light curve
implies a slighly higher radius and luminosity for star 2. The above empirical
values imply the logarithm of the internal structure constant log k2 = -1.937.
A comparison with Claret's stellar interior models implies an age close to 2
millions yrs for both stars. The claimed accuracy of modern element
determination of 1-2 per cent seems still a bit too optimistic and obtaining
new high-dispersion and high-resolution spectra is desirable.

Methods. To select our Lyman break galaxy (LBG) candidates, we adopted the well
established and widely used color-selection criterion (U-G vs. G-R). One of the
main advantages of our survey is that it has a wider dynamic color range for
U-dropout selection than in previous studies. This allows us to fully exploit
the depth of our R-band images, obtaining a robust sample with few interlopers.
In addition, for 2 of our fields we have spectroscopic redshift information
that is needed to better estimate the completeness of our sample and interloper
fraction. Results. Our limiting magnitudes reach 27.0(AB) in the R band
(5\sigma) and 28.6(AB) in the U band (1\sigma). This dataset was used to derive
LBG candidates at z~3. We obtained a catalog with a total of 12264 sources down
to the 50% completeness magnitude limit in the R band for each field. We find a
surface density of ~3 LBG candidates arcmin^2 down to R=25.5, where
completeness is >=95% for all 3 fields. This number is higher than the original
studies, but consistent with more recent samples.

and helicity. Free magnetic energy budgets of quiet-Sun regions represent a
rather continuous extension of respective active-region budgets towards lower
values, but the corresponding helicity transition is discontinuous due to the
incoherence of the helicity sense contrary to active regions. We further
estimate the instantaneous free magnetic-energy and relative magnetic-helicity
budgets of the entire quiet Sun, as well as the respective budgets over an
entire solar cycle. Derived instantaneous free magnetic energy budgets and, to
a lesser extent, relative magnetic helicity budgets over the entire quiet Sun
are comparable to the respective budgets of a sizeable active region, while
total budgets within a solar cycle are found higher than previously reported.
Free-energy budgets are comparable to the energy needed to power fine-scale

computationally intensive nature, we settle for parallel solutions in the
MapReduce framework, which has become in the last few years a {\em de facto}
standard for batch processing of massive data sets. We give both theoretical
and experimental contributions.
  On the theory side, we design the first exact scalable algorithm for counting
(and listing) $k$-cliques. Our algorithm uses $O(m^{3/2})$ total space and
$O(m^{k/2})$ work, where $m$ is the number of graph edges. This matches the
best-known bounds for triangle listing when $k=3$ and is work-optimal in the
worst case for any $k$, while keeping the communication cost independent of
$k$. We also design a sampling-based estimator that can dramatically reduce the
running time and space requirements of the exact approach, while providing very
accurate solutions with high probability.
  We then assess the effectiveness of different clique counting approaches

experimental results clearly highlight the algorithm of choice in different
scenarios and prove our exact approach to be the most effective when the number
of $k$-cliques is large, gracefully scaling to non-trivial values of $k$ even

extremely accurate estimates and large speedups, especially on the toughest

Here, we present two schemes for transformations of multipartite permutation
invariant Gaussian states by Gaussian local operations and classical

realization, making use of the fact, that in this picture, the whole N -
partite state can be described using two separable modes. Numerically, we study
entanglement transformations of tripartite states. Finally, we look at the

there is strong evidence that partial non-demolition measurement leads to a

synthesis models to the observed values, we determine best-fit physical
parameters under different assumptions about the star-formation history and
also consider the effect of nebular emission. For comparison we determine the
UV slope of the objects, and use it to estimate their SFR_UV99 by correcting
the UV luminosity following Meurer et al. (1999). A comparison between SFR
obtained through SED-fitting (SFR_fit) and the SFR_UV99 shows that the latter
are underestimated by a factor 2-10, regardless of the assumed SFH. Other SFR
indicators (radio, far-IR, X-ray, recombination lines) coherently indicate SFRs
a factor of 2-4 larger than SFR_UV99 and in closer agreement with SFR_fit. This
discrepancy is due to the solar metallicity implied by the usual beta-A1600
conversion factor. We propose a refined relation, appropriate for sub-solar
metallicity LBGs: A1600 = 5.32+1.99beta. This relation reconciles the
dust-corrected UV with the SED-fitting and the other SFR indicators. We show
that the fact that z~3 galaxies have sub-solar metallicity implies an upward
revision by a factor of ~1.5-2 of the global SFRD, depending on the assumptions
about the age of the stellar populations. We find very young best-fit ages
(10-500 Myrs) for all our objects. From a careful examination of the
uncertainties in the fit and the amplitude of the Balmer break we conclude that
there is little evidence of the presence of old stellar population in at least
half of the LBGs in our sample, suggesting that these objects are probably
caught during a huge star-formation burst, rather than being the result of a
smooth evolution.

invariance on the horizon and conveys momentum (and is ""rotating"" when

yielded 264 systems with available redshifts. The present redshift measurements
are consistent with the published values. The current cluster sample extends
the optically confirmed cluster sample from our cluster survey by 67 objects.
Moreover, it provides spectroscopic confirmation for 78 clusters among our
published cluster sample, which previously had only photometric redshifts. Of
the new cluster sample that comprises 67 systems, 55 objects are newly X-ray
discovered clusters and 52 systems are sources newly discovered as galaxy
clusters in optical and X-ray wavelengths. Based on the measured redshifts and
the fluxes given in the 2XMMi-DR3 catalogue, we estimated the X-ray
luminosities and masses of the cluster sample.

different languages, which would mean that human users that speak a different

subsequent emission of light from the outer region leads to compression and
rarefaction of the inner bodily mass so as to create nine celestial spheres,

describe the coupling of light and matter are solved numerically, subject to
initial conditions and critical criteria consistent with the text. Formation of
a universe with a non-infinite number of perfected spheres is extremely
sensitive to the initial conditions, the intensity of the light and the
transparency of these spheres. In this ""medieval multiverse"", only a small
range of opacity and initial density profiles lead to a stable universe with
nine perfected spheres. As in current cosmological thinking, the existence of

matter, which involves the violation of the null energy condition. In this
context, we investigate the possibility that wormholes could be supported by
quark matter at extreme densities. Theoretical and experimental investigations
of the structure of baryons show that strange quark matter, consisting of the
u, d and s quarks, is the most energetically favorable state of baryonic
matter. Moreover, at ultra-high densities, quark matter may exist in a variety
of superconducting states, namely, the Color-Flavor-Locked (CFL) phase.
Motivated by these theoretical models, we explore the conditions under which
wormhole geometries may be supported by the equations of state considered in
the theoretical investigations of quark-gluon interactions. For the description
of the normal quark matter we adopt the Massachusetts Institute of Technology
(MIT) bag model equation of state, while the color superconducting quark phases
are described by a first order approximation of the free energy. By assuming
specific forms for the bag and gap functions, several wormhole models are
obtained for both normal and superconducting quark matter. The effects of the
presence of an electrical charge are also taken into account.

be useful in games with imperfect information or uncertainty, where the whole

inequalities, turning the issue of quantum nonlocality from a matter of taste
into a matter of test. Years later, Hardy proposed a test for nonlocality
without inequality, which is a kind of ""something-versus-nothing"" argument.
Hardy's test for $n$ particles induces an $n$-partite Bell's inequality with
two dichotomic local measurements for each observer, which has been shown to be
violated by all entangled pure states. Our first result is to show that the
Bell-Hardy inequality arising form Hardy's nonlocality test is tight for an
arbitrary number of parties, i.e., it defines a facet of the Bell polytope in
the given scenario. On the other hand quantum theory is not that nonlocal since
it forbids signaling and even not as nonlocal as allowed by non-signaling
conditions, i.e., quantum mechanical predictions form a strict subset of the so
called non-signaling polytope. In the scenario of each observer measuring two
dichotomic observables, Fritz established a duality between the Bell polytope
and the non-signaling polytope: tight Bell's inequalities, the facets of the
Bell polytope, are in a one-to-one correspondence with extremal non-signaling
boxes, the vertices of the non-signaling polytope. Our second result is to
provide an alternative and more direct formula for this duality. As an example,
the tight Bell-Hardy inequality gives rise to an extremal non-signaling box
that serves as a natural multipartite generalization of Popescu-Rohrlich box.

account the mass-size and linewidth-size scaling relations observed in
molecular gas, originally discovered by Larson. We show that such relations can
have a strong impact on the size and mass of star-forming clumps, as well as on
the stability properties of the disc at all observable scales, making the
classical Toomre parameter a highly unreliable indicator of gravitational
instability. For instance, a disc with Q=1 can be far from marginal
instability, while a disc with Q<<1 can be marginally unstable. Our work raises
an important caveat: if clumpy discs at high redshift have scale-dependent
surface densities and velocity dispersions, as implied by the observed clump
scaling relations, then we cannot thoroughly understand their stability and
star formation properties unless we perform multi-scale observations. This will

  Processors: Evaluations on CPUs, GPUs and MICs","10 pages",,,,"cs.DB cs.DC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Geospatial Processing, such as queries based on point-to-polyline shortest
distance and point-in-polygon test, are fundamental to many scientific and
engineering applications, including post-processing large-scale environmental
and climate model outputs and analyzing traffic and travel patterns from
massive GPS collections in transportation engineering and urban studies.
Commodity parallel hardware, such as multi-core CPUs, many-core GPUs and Intel
MIC accelerators, provide enormous computing power which can potentially
achieve significant speedups on existing geospatial processing and open the
opportunities for new applications. However, the realizable potential for
geospatial processing on these new hardware devices is largely unknown due to
the complexity in porting serial algorithms to diverse parallel hardware
platforms. In this study, we aim at experimenting our data-parallel designs and
implementations of point-to-polyline shortest distance computation (P2P) and
point-in-polygon topological test (PIP) on different commodity hardware using
real large-scale geospatial data, comparing their performance and discussing
important factors that may significantly affect the performance. Our
experiments have shown that, while GPUs can be several times faster than
multi-core CPUs without utilizing the increasingly available SIMD computing
power on Vector Processing Units (VPUs) that come with multi-core CPUs and
MICs, multi-core CPUs and MICs can be several times faster than GPUs when VPUs
are utilized. By adopting a Domain Specific Language (DSL) approach to
exploiting the VPU computing power in geospatial processing, we are free from
programming SIMD intrinsic functions directly which makes the new approach more
effective, portable and scalable. Our designs, implementations and experiments
can serve as case studies for parallel geospatial computing on modern commodity
parallel hardware.

magma oceans during Earth's accretion. However, geochemical evidence requiring
a terrestrial magma ocean is scarce. Here we present evidence for at least two
separate magma ocean outgassing episodes on Earth based on the ratio of
primordial 3He to 22Ne in the present-day mantle. We demonstrate that the
depleted mantle 3He/22Ne ratio is at least 10 while a more primitive mantle
reservoir has a 3He/22Ne ratio of 2.3 to 3. The 3He/22Ne ratios of the mantle
reservoirs are higher than possible sources of terrestrial volatiles, including
the solar nebula ratio of 1.5. Therefore, a planetary process must have raised
the mantle's 3He/22Ne ratio. We show that long-term plate tectonic cycling is
incapable of raising the mantle 3He/22Ne ratio and may even lower it. However,
ingassing of a gravitationally accreted nebular atmosphere into a magma ocean
on the proto-Earth explains the 3He/22Ne and 20Ne/22Ne ratios of the primitive
mantle reservoir. Increasing the mantle 3He/22Ne ratio to a value of 10 in the
depleted mantle requires at least two episodes of atmospheric blow-off and
magma ocean outgassing associated with giant impacts during subsequent
terrestrial accretion. The preservation of a low 3He/22Ne ratio in a primitive
reservoir sampled by plumes suggests that the later giant impacts, including
the Moon-forming giant impact, did not generate a whole mantle magma ocean.
Atmospheric loss episodes associated with giant impacts provide an explanation
for Earth's subchondritic C/H, N/H, and Cl/F elemental ratios while preserving
chondritic isotopic ratios. If so, a significant proportion of terrestrial
water and potentially other major volatiles were accreted prior to the last
giant impact, otherwise the fractionated elemental ratios would have been
overprinted by the late veneer.

paradigm. In particular, we are interested in the contribution of rotation to
the problem of Cepheid masses, and explore testable predictions of quantities
that can be confronted with observations. Evolutionary models including a
homogeneous and self-consistent treatment of rotation are studied in detail
during the crossings of the classical instability strip (IS). The dependence of
several parameters on initial rotation is studied. These parameters include
mass, luminosity, temperature, lifetimes, equatorial velocity, surface
abundances, and rates of period change. Several key results are obtained: i)
mass-luminosity (M-L) relations depend on rotation, particularly during the
blue loop phase; ii) luminosity increases between crossings of the IS. Hence,
Cepheid M-L relations at fixed initial rotation rate depend on crossing number
(faster rotation yields greater luminosity difference between crossings); iii)
the Cepheid mass discrepancy problem vanishes when rotation and crossing number
are taken into account, without a need for high core overshooting values or
enhanced mass loss; iv) rotation creates dispersion around average parameters
predicted at fixed mass and metallicity. This is of particular importance for
the period-luminosity-relation, for which rotation is a source of intrinsic
dispersion; v) enhanced surface abundances do not unambiguously distinguish
Cepheids occupying the Hertzsprung gap from ones on blue loops (after
dredge-up), since rotational mixing can lead to significantly enhanced Main
Sequence (MS) abundances; vi) rotating models predict greater Cepheid ages than
non-rotating models due to longer MS lifetimes. Rotation has a significant
evolutionary impact on classical Cepheids and should no longer be neglected in
their study.

probable members, among which 4 have spectral type later than M6.0 and Teff

deviations from the standard paradigm of the early galactic nucleosynthesis. If
the r-process contamination is a common feature of halo stars, s-process
enhancements are found in a few Globular Clusters only. We show that the
combined pollution of AGB stars with mass ranging between 3 to 6 M$_\odot$ may
account for most of the features of the s-process overabundance in M4 and M22.
In these stars, the s process is a mixture of two different neutron-capture
nucleosynthesis episodes. The first is due to the 13C(a,n)16O reaction and
takes place during the interpulse periods. The second is due to the
22Ne(a,n)25Mg reaction and takes place in the convective zones generated by
thermal pulses. The production of the heaviest s elements (from Ba to Pb)
requires the first neutron burst, while the second produces large
overabundances of light s (Sr, Y, Zr). The first mainly operates in the
less-massive AGB stars, while the second dominates in the more-massive. From
the heavy-s/light-s ratio, we derive that the pollution phase should last for
$150\pm 50$ Myr, a period short enough compared to the formation timescale of
the Globular Cluster system, but long enough to explain why the s-process
pollution is observed in a few cases only. With few exceptions, our theoretical
prediction provides a reasonable reproduction of the observed s-process
abundances, from Sr to Hf. However, Ce is probably underproduced by our models,
while Rb and Pb are overproduced. Possible solutions are discussed.

several applications in the areas of human activity analysis, where there is a
need to perform fast search, and recognition in very high dimensional spaces.
The problem is made more challenging when representations such as landmarks,
contours, and human skeletons etc. are naturally studied in a non-Euclidean
setting where even simple operations are much more computationally intensive
than their Euclidean counterparts. We propose a geometry and data adaptive
symbolic framework that is shown to enable the deployment of fast and accurate
algorithms for activity recognition, dynamic texture recognition, motif
discovery. Toward this end, we present generalizations of key concepts of
piece-wise aggregation and symbolic approximation for the case of non-Euclidean
manifolds. We show that one can replace expensive geodesic computations with
much faster symbolic computations with little loss of accuracy in activity
recognition and discovery applications. The framework is general enough to work
across both Euclidean and non-Euclidean spaces, depending on appropriate
feature representations without compromising on the ultra-low bandwidth, high
speed and high accuracy. The proposed methods are ideally suited for real-time
systems and low complexity scenarios.

staggered fermions at nonzero temperature and quark density, by analytic
continuation from imaginary chemical potentials. Monte Carlo simulations are
performed adopting the HISQ/tree action discretization, as implemented in the
code by the MILC collaboration, suitably modified to include a nonzero
imaginary baryon chemical potential. We work on a line of constant physics, as
determined in Ref.\cite{Bazavov:2011nk}, adjusting the couplings so as to keep
the strange quark mass $m_s$ fixed at its physical value, with a light to
strange mass ratio $m_l/m_s=1/20$. In the present investigation we set the
chemical potential at the same value for the three quark species,
$\mu_l=\mu_s\equiv \mu$. We explore lattices of different spatial extensions,
$16^3\times 6$ and $24^3\times 6$, to check for finite size effects, and
present results on a $32^3 \times 8$ lattice, to check for finite cut-off
effects. We discuss our results for the curvature $\kappa$ of the critical line
at $\mu = 0$, which indicate $\kappa=0.018(4)$, and compare them with previous
lattice determinations by alternative methods and with experimental
determinations of the freeze-out curve.

  Astron",,,,"astro-ph.SR astro-ph.GA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Stars are born in dense cores of molecular clouds. The core mass function
(CMF), which is the mass distribution of dense cores, is important for
understanding the stellar initial mass function (IMF). We obtained 350 $\mu$m
dust continuum data using the SHARC-II camera at the Caltech Submillimeter
Observatory (CSO) telescope. A 350 $\mu$m map covering 0.25 ${deg}^{2}$ of the
Ophiuchus molecular cloud was created by mosaicing 56 separate scans. The CSO
telescope had an angular resolution of 9 $^{\prime\prime}$, corresponding to
$1.2\times {10}^{3}\ $AU at the distance of the Ophiuchus molecular cloud (131
pc). The data was reduced using the Comprehensive Reduction Utility for
SHARC-II (CRUSH). The flux density map was analyzed using the GaussClumps
algorithm, within which 75 cores has been identified. We used the Spitzer c2d
catalogs to separate the cores into 63 starless cores and 12 protostellar
cores. By locating Jeans instabilities, 55 prestellar cores (a subcategory of
starless cores) were also identified. The excitation temperatures, which were
derived from FCRAO ${}^{12}$CO data, help to improve the accuracy of the masses
of the cores. We adopted a Monte Carlo approach to analyze the CMF with two
types of functional forms; power law and log-normal. The whole and prestellar
CMF are both well fitted by a log-normal distribution, with $\mu
=-1.18\pm0.10,\ \sigma =0.58\pm0.05$ and $\mu =1.40\pm0.10,\ \sigma
=0.50\pm0.05$ respectively. This finding suggests that turbulence influences
the evolution of the Ophiuchus molecular cloud.

gravitational lensing techniques have facilitated the discovery of galaxies as
far back as z ~ 10-12, a truly remarkable achievement. However, this rapid
emergence of high-z galaxies, barely ~ 200 Myr after the transition from
Population III star formation to Population II, appears to be in conflict with
the standard view of how the early Universe evolved. This problem has much in
common with the better known (and probably related) premature appearance of
supermassive black holes at z ~ 6. It is difficult to understand how ~ 10^9
solar-mass black holes could have appeared so quickly after the big bang
without invoking non-standard accretion physics and the formation of massive
seeds, neither of which is seen in the local Universe. In earlier work, we
showed that the appearance of high-z quasars could instead be understood more
reasonably in the context of the R_h=ct Universe, which does not suffer from
the same time compression issues as LCDM does at early epochs. Here, we build
on that work by demonstrating that the evolutionary growth of primordial
galaxies was consistent with the current view of how the first stars formed,
but only with the timeline afforded by the R_h=ct cosmology. We also show that
the growth of high-z quasars was mutually consistent with that of the earliest
galaxies, though it is not yet clear whether the former grew from 5-20
solar-mass seeds created in Population III or Population II supernova
explosions.

  Network",,,,,"cs.NI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  RSS-based device-free localization (DFL) is a very promising technique which
allows localizing the target without attaching any electronic tags in wireless
environments. In cluttered indoor environments, the performance of DFL degrades
due to multipath interference. In this paper, we propose a multichannel
obstructed link detection method based on the RSS variation on difference
channels. Multichannel detection is proved to be very effective in multipath
environments compared to the single channel detection. We also propose a new
localization method termed as robust weighted least square (RWLS) method. RWLS
first use spatial property to eliminate the interference links and then employ
WLS method to localize the target. Since the spatial detection relies on the
unknown position of the target. A coarse position estimation of target is also
presented. RWLS is robust to interference links and has low computation
complexity. Results from real experiments verify the effectiveness of the
proposed method.

flexibility in sparse signal recovery. Specifically, recovery for the resulting
measurement matrix does not depend on any fixed algorithm but rather on the
recovery scheme of each ingredient matrix. In this paper, we investigate
certain trade-offs for signal recovery, considering the computational
investment required. Coping with noise in signal recovery requires additional
conditions, both on the pattern matrix and on the ingredient measurement
matrices.
