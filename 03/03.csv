initiation of coronal mass ejections. The Chen-Shibata (2000) model, which
addresses the connection between emerging flux and flux rope eruptions, can be
implemented numerically to study how emerging flux through the photosphere can
impact the eruption of a pre-existing coronal flux rope. The model's
sensitivity to the initial conditions and reconnection micro-physics is
investigated with a parameter study. In particular, we aim to understand the
stability of the coronal flux rope in the context of X-point collapse and the
effects of boundary driving in both unstratified and stratified atmospheres. In
the absence of driving, we assess the behavior of waves in the vicinity of the
X-point. With boundary driving applied, we study the effects of reconnection
micro-physics and atmospheric stratification on the eruption. We find that the
Chen-Shibata equilibrium can be unstable to an X-point collapse even in the
absence of driving due to wave accumulation at the X-point. However, the
equilibrium can be stabilized by reducing the compressibility of the plasma,
which allows small-amplitude waves to pass through the X-point without
accumulation. Simulations with the photospheric boundary driving evaluate the
impact of reconnection micro-physics and atmospheric stratification on the
resulting dynamics: we show the evolution of the system to be determined
primarily by the structure of the global magnetic fields with little
sensitivity to the micro-physics of magnetic reconnection; and in a stratified
atmosphere, we identify a novel mechanism for producing quasi-periodic behavior
at the reconnection site behind a rising flux rope as a possible explanation of
similar phenomena observed in solar and stellar flares.

simulations in Pt/Ti bilayer we characterize the superdiffusive nature of
interfacial atomic transport. In particular, the low-energy ($0.5$ keV)
ion-sputtering induced transient enhanced intermixing has been studied by MD
simulations. {\em Ab initio} density functional calculations have been used to
check and reparametrize the employed heteronuclear interatomic potential. We
find a robust intermixing in Pt/Ti driven by nanoscale mass-anisotropy . The
sum of the square of atomic displacements $\langle R^2 \rangle$ asymptotically
scales nonlinearly ($\langle R^2 \rangle \propto t^2$), where $t$ is the time
of ion-sputtering, respectively which is the fingerprint of superdiffusive
features. This anomalous behavior explains the high diffusity tail in the
concentration profile obtained by Auger electron spectroscopy depth profiling
(AES-DP) analysis in Pt/Ti bilayer (reported in ref.: P. S\""ule, et al., J.
Appl. Phys., 101, 043502 (2007)). In Ti/Pt bilayer a linear time scaling of
$\langle R^2 \rangle \propto t$ has been found at the Ti/Pt interface
indicating the suppression of superdiffusive features. These findings are
inconsistent with the standard ion-mixing models. Instead a simple accelerative
effect of the downward fluxes of energetic particles on the unidirectional
fluxes of preferential intermixing of Pt atoms seems to explain the enhancement
of interfacial broadening in Pt/Ti. Contrary to this in Ti/Pt the fluxes of
recoils are in counterflow with intermixing Pt atoms and hence slows down the
nanoscale mass-effect driven ballistic preferential mobility of Pt atoms.

Seebeck coefficient $S$. Nanostructuring is one of the promising ways to
achieve this goal as it can substantially suppress lattice contribution to
$\kappa$. However, it may also unfavorably influence the electronic transport
in an uncontrollable way. Here we theoretically demonstrate that this issue can
be ideally solved by fabricating graphene nanoribbons with heavy adatoms and
nanopores. These systems, acting as a two-dimensional topological insulator
with robust helical edge states carrying electrical current, yield a highly
optimized power factor $S^2G$ per helical conducting channel. Concurrently,
their array of nanopores impedes the lattice thermal conduction through the
bulk. Using quantum transport simulations coupled with first-principles
electronic and phononic band structure calculations, the thermoelectric figure

distributions and high levels of noise in the images. Bayesian inference
provides a principled way for regularizing the problem using prior knowledge. A
fundamental choice is how one measures ""distances"" between shapes in an image.
It has been shown that the straightforward geometric L2 distance is degenerate
and leads to pathological situations. This is avoided when using Sobolev
gradients, rendering the segmentation problem less ill-posed. The high
computational cost and implementation overhead of Sobolev gradients, however,
have hampered practical applications. We show how particle methods as applied
to image segmentation allow for a simple and computationally efficient
implementation of Sobolev gradients. We show that the evaluation of Sobolev
gradients amounts to particle-particle interactions along the contour in an
image. We extend an existing particle-based segmentation algorithm to using
Sobolev gradients. Using synthetic and real-world images, we benchmark the
results for both 2D and 3D images using piecewise smooth and piecewise constant
region models. The present particle approximation of Sobolev gradients is 2.8
to 10 times faster than the previous reference implementation, but retains the
known favorable properties of Sobolev gradients. This speedup is achieved by
using local particle-particle interactions instead of solving a global Poisson
equation at each iteration. The computational time per iteration is higher for
Sobolev gradients than for L2 gradients. Since Sobolev gradients precondition
the optimization problem, however, a smaller number of overall iterations may
be necessary for the algorithm to converge, which can in some cases amortize
the higher per-iteration cost.

laboratory, a privileged location to study TeV-scale cosmic rays. For the
analysis here presented, the detector was used to measure the atmospheric muon
charge ratio in the TeV region. OPERA collected charge-separated cosmic ray
data between 2008 and 2012. More than 3 million atmospheric muon events were
detected and reconstructed, among which about 110000 multiple muon bundles. The
charge ratio $R_{\mu} \equiv N_{\mu^+}/N_{\mu^-}$ was measured separately for
single and for multiple muon events. The analysis exploited the inversion of
the magnet polarity which was performed on purpose during the 2012 Run. The
combination of the two data sets with opposite magnet polarities allowed
minimizing systematic uncertainties and reaching an accurate determination of
the muon charge ratio. Data were fitted to obtain relevant parameters on the
composition of primary cosmic rays and the associated kaon production in the
forward fragmentation region. In the surface energy range 1-20 TeV investigated
by OPERA, $R_{\mu}$ is well described by a parametric model including only pion
and kaon contributions to the muon flux, showing no significant contribution of
the prompt component. The energy independence supports the validity of Feynman
scaling in the fragmentation region up to $200$ TeV/nucleon primary energy.

we are sensitive to colder and/or less luminous galaxies in the surroundings of

compressible version, both for the liquid and the gas phase so that the entropy
principle can be easily evaluated. This yields a full PDE system for a
compressible two-phase fluid with mass transfer of the gaseous species. Then
the passage to an incompressible solvent in the liquid phase is discussed,
where a carefully chosen equation of state for the liquid mixture pressure
allows for a limit in which the solvent density is constant. We finally provide
a simplification of the PDE system in case of a dilute solution.

different practicable argumentation schemes. The first solution consists of the
derivation of a sharp lower bound for the objective function and the solving of
an equation to find all vectors that yield the bound. The second is based on
extremal properties of the spectral radius of matrices and involves the

scattering measurements of the magnetic excitation spectrum in
$\mathrm{FeV_2O_4}$, a recent example of a ferrimagnetic spinel vanadate which
is available in single crystal form. We report the existence of two emergent
magnon modes at low temperatures, which draw strong parallels with the closely
related material, $\mathrm{MnV_2O_4}$. We were able to reproduce the essential
elements of both the magnetic ordering pattern and the dispersion of the
inelastic modes with semi- classical spin wave calculations, using a minimal
model that implies a sizeable single-ion anisotropy on the vanadium sublattice.
Taking into account the direction of ordered spins, we associate this
anisotropy with the large trigonal distortion of $\mathrm{VO_6}$ octahedra,
previously observed via neutron powder diffraction measurements. We further
report on the spin gap, which is an order-of-magnitude larger than that
observed in $\mathrm{MnV_2O_4}$. By looking at the overall temperature
dependence, we were able to show that the gap magnitude is largely associated
with the ferro-orbital order known to exist on the iron sublattice, but the
contribution to the gap from the vanadium sublattice is in fact comparable to

studied the magnetic anisotropy in the pressure-induced ferromagnetic state.
The effect of pressure on the magnetization with magnetic field along the

Such signal is sensitive to the growth of structure in the universe, and in
particular can be used as a measurement of $\sigma_8$ which is independent from
more traditional methods such as those based on the CMB, cosmic shear or
cluster abundance. We extend here that analysis to allow for intrinsic
non-Gaussianities in the supernova PDF, and discuss how this can be best
modelled using the Bayes Factor. Although it was shown that a precise
measurement of $\sigma_8$ requires ~$10^5$ supernovae, current data already
allows an important proof of principle. In particular we make use of the 732
supernovae with z < 1 of the recent JLA catalog and show that a simple
treatment of intrinsic non-Gaussianities with a couple of nuisance parameters
is enough for our method to yield the values $\sigma_8 = 0.84^{+0.28}_{-0.65}$
or $\sigma_8 < 1.45$ at a $2\sigma$ confidence level. This result is consistent
with mock simulations and it is also in agreement with independent measurements

restricted in a single rigid cavity, we show that the uncertainty bound
exhibits a periodic evolution w.r.t. the duration of acceleration. With
properly chosen cavity parameters, the uncertainty bounds could be protected.
Moreover, we find that uncertainty bound can be degraded for specific quantum

construct a single convex or affine hull model for classification. However,
strong artificial features and noisy data may be generated from combinations of
training samples when significant intra-class variations and/or noise occur in
the image set. Existing multi-model approaches extract local models by
clustering each image set individually only once, with fixed clusters used for
matching with various image sets. This may not be optimal for discrimination,
as undesirable environmental conditions (eg. illumination and pose variations)
may result in the two closest clusters representing different characteristics
of an object (eg. frontal face being compared to non-frontal face). To address
the above problem, we propose a novel approach to enhance nearest points based
methods by integrating affine/convex hull classification with an adapted
multi-model approach. We first extract multiple local convex hulls from a query
image set via maximum margin clustering to diminish the artificial variations
and constrain the noise in local convex hulls. We then propose adaptive
reference clustering (ARC) to constrain the clustering of each gallery image
set by forcing the clusters to have resemblance to the clusters in the query
image set. By applying ARC, noisy clusters in the query set can be discarded.
Experiments on Honda, MoBo and ETH-80 datasets show that the proposed method
outperforms single model approaches and other recent techniques, such as Sparse
Approximated Nearest Points, Mutual Subspace Method and Manifold Discriminant

a very important and challenging subject in modern astronomy. In order to probe
the IGMF from rotation measures (RMs) of extragalactic radio sources, we need
to separate RMs due to other origins such as the source, intervening galaxies,
and our Galaxy. In this paper, we discuss observational strategies for the
separation by means of Faraday tomography (Faraday RM Synthesis). We consider
an observation of a single radio source such as a radio galaxy or a quasar
viewed through the Galaxy and the cosmic web. We then compare the observation
with another observation of a neighbor source with a small angular separation.
Our simulations with simple models of the sources suggest that it would be not
easy to detect the RM due to the IGMF of order ~ 1 rad/m/m, an expected value
for the IGMF through a single filament. Contrary to it, we find that the RM of
at least ~10 rad/m/m could be detected with the SKA or its
pathfinders/precursors, if we achieve selections of ideal sources. These
results would be improved if we incorporate decomposition techniques such as
RMCLEAN and QU-fitting. We discuss feasibility of the strategies for cases with
complex Galactic emissions as well as with effects of observational noise and
radio frequency interferences.

azimuthal angles with respect to different orders of event planes. The ratio
$v_{n}^{jet}/\varepsilon_{n}$ increases from peripheral to noncentral

the $v_{n}^{jet}$ is produced by the strong interactions between jet and the

exactly-solvable test case, we choose the problem of enzyme catalysis. Link of
the total entropy production with the enzyme efficiency is also established,
offering a desirable connection with the inherent irreversibility of the
process. The chief outcomes are finally noted in a more general reaction

by generating a time-dependent manifold of revolution around a straight line.
In this simple model where layers of spherical shells of the universe
non-uniformly rotate, the Einstein field equations require this phenomenon to
be caused by a static mass-energy distribution with time-dependent
$T^{\phi\phi}$ (quadratic with time) and $T^{r\phi}=T^{\phi r}$ (linear with
time). This indicates that a time-dependent stress along a certain direction
results in a spacetime shift in that direction. For this model however, such
material violates the null energy condition. Incidentally, the various
coordinate systems describing the Schwarzschild solution can be viewed as
arising from the freedom in parametrising the straight line and the radial
function in the general method of constructing spacetime by generating
manifolds of revolution around a given curve.

investigate the existence of hyperonic matter in the central regions of massive
neutron stars using Relativistic Mean Field (RMF) theory with the recently
proposed IUFSU model. The IUFSU model is extended by including hyperons to
study the neutron star in $\beta$ equilibrium. The effect of different
hyperonic potentials, namely $\Sigma$ and $\Xi$ potentials, on the EoS and
hence the maximum mass of neutron stars has been studied. We have also
considered the effect of stellar rotation since the observed massive stars are
pulsars.
  It has been found that a maximum mass of $1.93M_{\odot}$, which is within the
3$\sigma$ limit of the observed mass of PSR J$0348+0432$, can be obtained for
rotating stars, with certain choices of the hyperonic potentials. The said star
  contains a fair amount of hyperons near the core.

help predict the magnitudes in the W1 and W2 bands, the two WISE bands most
affected by saturation, for calibration purpose, and to provide physical
parameters of the AGB sample stars for analysis. DUSTY is verified against the
ISO spectra to be a good tool to reproduce the spectral energy distributions of
these AGB stars. Systematic magnitude-dependent offsets have been identified in
WISE W1 and W2 magnitudes of the saturated AGB stars, and empirical calibration
formulas are obtained for them on the basis of 1877 (W1) and 1558 (W2) AGB
stars that are successfully fit with DUSTY. According to the calibration
formulae, the corrections for W1 at 5 mag and W2 at 4 mag are $-0.383$ and

source-destination (SD) pairs and one relay, where the relay schedules only m
user pairs for transmissions. For the special case of m = 1, the addressed
scheduling problem is equivalent to relay selection for the scenario with one
SD pair and M relays. In conventional cooperative networks, the max-min
selection criterion has been recognized as a diversity-optimal strategy for
relay selection and user scheduling. The main contribution of this paper is to
show that the use of the max-min criterion will result in loss of diversity
gains in energy harvesting cooperative networks. Particularly when only a
single user is scheduled, analytical results are developed to demonstrate that
the diversity gain achieved by the max-min criterion is only (M+1)/2, much less
than the maximal diversity gain M. The max-min criterion suffers this diversity
loss because it does not reflect the fact that the source-relay channels are
more important than the relay-destination channels in energy harvesting
networks. Motivated by this fact, a few user scheduling approaches tailored to
energy harvesting networks are developed and their performance is analyzed.
Simulation results are provided to demonstrate the accuracy of the developed
analytical results and facilitate the performance comparison.

spectrum band with a primary user (PU). An interference power constraint (IPC)
is imposed on the SN to protect the PU. Under such a constraint and the
individual transmit power constraint (TPC) imposed on each SU, we investigate
the power allocation strategies to maximize the ergodic sum-rate of a fading
C-MAC without successive interference cancellation (SIC). In particular, this
paper considers two types of constraints: (1) average TPC and average IPC, (2)
peak TPC and peak IPC. For the first case, it is proved that the optimal power
allocation is dynamic time-division multiple-access (D-TDMA), which is exactly
the same as the optimal power allocation to maximize the ergodic sum-rate of
the fading C-MAC with SIC under the same constraints. For the second case, it
is proved that the optimal solution must be at the extreme points of the
feasible region. It is shown that D-TDMA is optimal with high probability when
the number of SUs is large. Besides, we show that, when the SUs can be sorted

mission concept by the European Space Agency in the context of the M3 selection
process. Through direct measurement of the atmospheric chemical composition of
hundreds of exoplanets, EChO would address fundamental questions such as: What
are exoplanets made of? How do planets form and evolve? What is the origin of
exoplanet diversity?
  More specifically, EChO is a dedicated survey mission for transit and eclipse
spectroscopy capable of observing a large, diverse and well-defined planetary
sample within its four to six year mission lifetime.
  In this paper we use the end-to-end instrument simulator EChOSim to model the
currently discovered targets, to gauge which targets are observable and assess
the EChO performances obtainable for each observing tier and time. We show that
EChO would be capable of observing over 170 relativity diverse planets if it
were launched today, and the wealth of optimal targets for EChO expected to be
discovered in the next 10 years by space and ground-based facilities is simply
overwhelming.
  In addition, we build on previous molecular detectability studies to show
what molecules and abundances will be detectable by EChO for a selection of
real targets with various molecular compositions and abundances.
  EChO's unique contribution to exoplanetary science will be in identifying the
main constituents of hundreds of exoplanets in various mass/temperature
regimes, meaning that we will be looking no longer at individual cases but at
populations. Such a universal view is critical if we truly want to understand
the processes of planet formation and evolution in various environments.
  In this paper we present a selection of key results. The full results are
available online (http://www.ucl.ac.uk/exoplanets/echotargetlist/).

on-shell, in an inhomogeneous XXX chain in the Sutherland limit, where the
number of magnons is comparable with the length L of the chain and the magnon
rapidities arrange in a small number of macroscopically large Bethe strings.
The leading order in the large L limit is known to be expressed through a
contour integral of a dilogarithm. Here we derive the subleading term. Our
analysis is based on a new contour-integral representation of the inner product
in terms of a Fredholm determinant. We give two derivations of the sub-leading
term. Besides a direct derivation by solving a Riemann-Hilbert problem, we give
a less rigorous, but more intuitive derivation by field-theoretical methods.
For that we represent the Fredholm determinant as an expectation value in a
Fock space of chiral fermions and then bosonize. We construct a collective
field for the bosonized theory, the short wave-length part of which may be
evaluated exactly, while the long wave-length part is amenable to a $1/L$
expansion. Our treatment thus results in a systematic 1/L expansion of
structure factors within the Sutherland limit.

relativistic thermal quantum field theory by considering it in a moving
reference system. In this frame an observer can measure the entropy density of
the system directly from its average total momentum. In the Euclidean path
integral formalism, this amounts to compute the expectation value of the
off-diagonal components T_{0k} of the energy-momentum tensor in presence of
shifted boundary conditions. The entropy is thus easily measured from the
expectation value of a local observable computed at the target temperature T
only. At large T, the temperature itself is the only scale which drives the
systematic errors, and the lattice spacing can be tuned to perform a reliable
continuum limit extrapolation while keeping finite-size effects under control.
We test this strategy for the four-dimensional SU(3) Yang-Mills theory. We
present precise results for the entropy density and its step-scaling function
in the temperature range 0.9 T_c - 20 T_c. At each temperature, we consider
four lattice spacings in order to extrapolate the results to the continuum
limit. As a byproduct we also determine the ultraviolet finite renormalization
constant of T_{0k} by imposing suitable Ward identities. These findings
establish this strategy as a solid, simple and efficient method for an accurate
determination of the equation of state of a relativistic thermal field theory
over several orders of magnitude in T.

systems. These so-called cone kernels feature an explicit dependence on the
dynamical vector field operating in the phase-space manifold, estimated
empirically through finite-differences of time-ordered data samples. In
particular, cone kernels assign strong affinity to pairs of samples whose
relative displacement vector lies within a narrow cone aligned with the
dynamical vector field. As a result, in a suitable asymptotic limit, the
associated diffusion operator generates diffusions along the dynamical flow,
and is invariant under a weakly restrictive class of transformations of the
data, which includes conformal transformations. Moreover, the corresponding
Dirichlet form is governed by the directional derivative of functions along the
dynamical vector field. The latter feature is metric-independent. The diffusion
eigenfunctions obtained via cone kernels are therefore adapted to the dynamics
in that they vary predominantly in directions transverse to the flow. We
demonstrate the utility of cone kernels in nonlinear flows on the 2-torus and
North Pacific sea surface temperature data generated by a comprehensive climate

like--particle and neutron--proton tensor effects within a mean--field
description. By analyzing Ca isotopes, we show that the like--particle tensor
contribution induces shell effects that render these nuclei more magic than
they would be predicted by neglecting it. In particular, such induced shell
effects are stronger in the nucleus $^{52}$Ca and the single--particle gaps are
increased in both isotopes due to the tensor force. By studying $N=32$ and
$N=34$ isotones, neutron--proton tensor effects may be isolated and their role
analyzed. It is shown that neutron--proton tensor effects lead to increasing
$N=32$ and $N=34$ gaps, when going along isotonic chains, from $^{58}$Fe to
$^{52}$Ca, and from $^{60}$Fe to $^{54}$Ca, respectively.
  The mean--field calculations are perfomed by employing one Skyrme parameter
set, that was introduced in a previous work by fitting the tensor parameters
together with the spin--orbit strength. The signs and the values of the tensor
strengths are thus checked within this specific application. The obtained
results indicate that the employed parameter set, even if generated with a
partial adjustment of the parameters of the force, leads to the correct shell
behavior and provides, in particular, a description of the magicity of
$^{52}$Ca and $^{54}$Ca within a pure mean--field picture with the effective
two--body Skyrme interaction.

Langmuir turbulence expected to exist in high energy astrophysical objects by
using numerical method. The spectral shape is characterized by the spatial
scale {\lambda}, field strength {\sigma}, and frequency of the Langmuir waves,
and in term of frequency they are represented by {\omega}_0 =
2{\pi}c/{\lambda}, {\omega}_st = e{\sigma}/mc, and {\omega}_p, respectively. We
normalize {\omega}_st and {\omega}_p by {\omega}_0 as \a \equiv
{\omega}_st/{\omega}_0 and \b \equiv{\omega}_p/{\omega}_0, and examine the
spectral shape in the a-b plane. An earlier study based on Diffusive Radiation
in Langmuir turbulence (DRL) theory by Fleishman and Toptygin showed that the
typical frequency is {\gamma}^2{\omega}_p and that the low frequency spectrum
behaves as F_{\omega} pronto {\omega}^1 for b > 1 irrespective of a. Here, we
adopt the first principle numerical approach to obtain the radiation spectra in
more detail. We generate Langmuir turbulence by superposing Fourier
modes,inject monoenergetic electrons, solve the equation of motion, and
calculate the radiation spectra using Lienard-Wiechert potential. We find
different features from the DRL theory for a>b>1. The peak frequency turns out
to be {\gamma}^2{\omega}_st which is higher than {\gamma}^2{\omega}_p predicted
in the DRL theory, and the spectral index of low frequency region is not 1 but
1/3. It is because the typical deflection angle of electrons is larger than the
angle of the beaming cone sim 1/{\gamma}. We call the radiation for this case
""Wiggler Radiation in Langmuir turbulence"" (WRL).

uncharged black holes are described by the Kerr solution and are completely
specified by their mass $M$ and by their spin parameter $a$. In this paper, we
explore the possibility of distinguishing Kerr and Bardeen black holes from
their shadow. In Hioki & Maeda (2009), under the assumption that the background
geometry is described by the Kerr solution, the authors proposed an algorithm
to estimate the value of $a/M$ by measuring the distortion parameter $\delta$,
an observable quantity that characterizes the shape of the shadow. Here, we try
to extend their approach. Since the Hioki-Maeda distortion parameter is
degenerate with respect to the spin and possible deviations from the Kerr
solution, one has to measure another quantity to test the Kerr black hole
hypothesis. We study a few possibilities. We find that it is extremely
difficult to distinguish Kerr and Bardeen black holes from the sole observation
of the shadow, and out of reach for the near future. The combination of the
measurement of the shadow with possible accurate radio observations of a pulsar
in a compact orbit around SgrA$^*$ could be a more promising strategy to verify

article, a kinked double-elliptic solution is found for neutron transport to a
small sample from a small (virtual) source, as given e.g. for instruments using
a pinhole beam extraction with a focusing feeder. A guide consisting of two
elliptical parts connected by a linear kinked section is shown by VITESS
simulations to deliver a high brilliance transfer as well as a homogeneous
divergence distribution while avoiding direct line of sight to the source. It
performs better than a recently proposed ellipse-parabola hybrid when used in a
ballistic context with a kinked or curved central part. Another recently
proposed solution, an analytically determined non-linear focusing guide shape,
is applied here for the first time in a kinked and curved ballistic context.
The latter is shown to yield comparable results for long wavelength neutrons as
the guide design found here, with a larger inhomogeneity in the divergence but
higher transmission of thermal neutrons. It needs however a larger (virtual)
source and might be more difficult to build in a real instrument.

coincidence on m letter irreducible substitution has been introduced in Dekking

the property of pure discrete spectrum of the tiling dynamics. The relation

generalize strong coincidence to higher dimensions and show the implication
from overlap coincidence to the new strong coincidence when the associated
height group is trivial. Furthermore we introduce a new criterion simultaneous
coincidence and show the implication from overlap coincidence to the
simultaneous coincidence. The triviality of the height group is shown in Barge

(iii) infer the model parameters and interpret them in terms of structural

that it is possible to improve significantly along the second dimension by
going beyond the pair-wise Potts models from statistical physics, which have
hitherto been the focus of the field. These (simple) extensions are motivated
by multiple sequence alignments often containing long stretches of gaps which,

of an applied electric field, the gas is partially ionized by the electron
avalanche process. In order for the electron temperature to increase, the
remaining neutrals need to be fully ionized in the plasma burn-through phase,
as radiation is the main contribution to the electron power loss. The radiated
power loss can be significantly affected by impurities resulting from
interaction with the plasma facing components. The DYON code is a plasma
burn-through simulator developed at Joint European Torus (JET) [1] [2]. The
dynamic evolution of the plasma temperature and plasma densities including
impurity content is calculated in a self-consistent way, using plasma wall
interaction models. The recent installation of a beryllium wall at JET enabled
validation of the plasma burn-through model in the presence of new, metallic
plasma facing components. The simulation results of the plasma burn-through
phase show consistent good agreement against experiments at JET, and explain
differences observed during plasma initiation with the old carbon plasma facing
components. In the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER), the
allowable toroidal electric field is restricted to 0.35 [V/m], which is
significantly lower compared to the typical value (~ 1 [V/m]) used in the
present devices. The limitation on toroidal electric field also reduces the
range of other operation parameters during plasma formation in ITER. Thus,
predictive simulations of plasma burn-through in ITER using validated model is
of crucial importance. This paper provides an overview of the DYON code and the

longitudinal oscillations in a nearby filament. The triggering mechanism
appears to be episodic jets connecting the energetic event with the filament
threads. In the present work we analyze this periodic motion in a large
fraction of the filament to characterize the underlying physics of the
oscillation as well as the filament properties. The results support our
previous theoretical conclusions that the restoring force of large-amplitude
longitudinal oscillations is solar gravity, and the damping mechanism is the
ongoing accumulation of mass onto the oscillating threads. Based on our
previous work, we used the fitted parameters to determine the magnitude and
radius of curvature of the dipped magnetic field along the filament, as well as
the mass accretion rate onto the filament threads. These derived properties are
nearly uniform along the filament, indicating a remarkable degree of
cohesiveness throughout the filament channel. Moreover, the estimated mass
accretion rate implies that the footpoint heating responsible for the thread
formation, according to the thermal nonequilibrium model, agrees with previous
coronal heating estimates. We estimate the magnitude of the energy released in
the nearby event by studying the dynamic response of the filament threads, and
discuss the implications of our study for filament structure and heating.

corrections to the tree-level tachyon mass using the frame-work of SU(2)
Yang-Mills theory in (1 + 1)-dimensions. We show that the one-loop two-point
functions are ultraviolet finite due to cancellation of ultraviolet divergence
between the amplitudes containing bosons and fermions in the loop. The
amplitudes are found to be infrared divergent due to the presence of massless
fields in the loops. We compute the finite temperature mass correction to all
the massless fields and use these temperature dependent masses to compute the
tachyonic mass correction. We show numerically the existence of a transition
temperature at which the effective mass of the tree-level tachyons becomes
zero, thereby stabilizing the brane configuration.

coupled a 2D model of a protoplanetary disk around a T Tauri star with a
gas-grain chemical network including COMs. We compare compare synthesised line
intensities and calculated column densities with observations and determine
those COMs which may be observable in future. COMs are efficiently formed in
the disk midplane via grain-surface chemical reactions, reaching peak
grain-surface fractional abundances 1e-6 - 1e-4 that of the H nuclei number
density. COMs formed on grain surfaces are returned to the gas phase via
non-thermal desorption; however, gas-phase species reach lower fractional
abundances than their grain-surface equivalents, 1e-12 - 1e-7. Including the
irradiation of grain mantle material helps build further complexity in the ice
through the replenishment of grain-surface radicals which take part in further
grain-surface reactions. There is reasonable agreement with several line
transitions of H2CO observed towards several T Tauri star-disk systems. The
synthesised line intensities for CH3OH are consistent with upper limits
determined towards all sources. Our models suggest CH3OH should be readily
observable in nearby protoplanetary disks with ALMA; however, detection of more

consistent with those derived from cometary comae observations providing
additional evidence for the hypothesis that comets (and other planetesimals)

AGPS sources, especially those that emit primarily in hard X-rays (2-10 keV)
within the F_x ~ 10^-13 to 10^-11 erg cm^-2 s^-1 X-ray flux range. In ChIcAGO,
the subarcsecond localization capabilities of Chandra have been combined with a
detailed multi-wavelength follow-up program, with the ultimate goal of
classifying the >100 unidentified sources in the AGPS. Overall to date, 93
unidentified AGPS sources have been observed with Chandra as part of the
ChIcAGO survey. A total of 253 X-ray point sources have been detected in these
Chandra observations within 3' of the original ASCA positions. We have
identified infrared and optical counterparts to the majority of these sources,
using both new observations and catalogs from existing Galactic plane surveys.
X-ray and infrared population statistics for the X-ray point sources detected
in the Chandra observations reveal that the primary populations of Galactic
plane X-ray sources that emit in the F_x ~ 10^-13 to 10^-11 erg cm^-2 s^-1 flux
range are active stellar coronae, massive stars with strong stellar winds that
are possibly in colliding-wind binaries, X-ray binaries, and magnetars. There
is also a fifth population that is still unidentified but, based on its X-ray
and infrared properties, likely comprise partly of Galactic sources and partly
of active galactic nuclei.

to solve above problem numerically, it is beneficial to resolve these layers.
On properly layer-adapted meshes we can apply finite element methods and

the nonlinearity and the multiplicative complexity. We show that if one-way
functions exist, no algorithm can compute the multiplicative complexity in time
$2^{O(n)}$ given the truth table of length $2^n$, in fact under the same
assumption it is impossible to approximate the multiplicative complexity within
a factor of $(2-\epsilon)^{n/2}$. When given a circuit, the problem of
determining the multiplicative complexity is in the second level of the

studying quantum fluctuations in interacting spin systems. The echo control of
the photon polarization is realized by flipping the polarization with a
birefringence crystal. The FRES, similar to spin echo in magnetic resonance
spectroscopy, can suppress the effects of the static magnetic fluctuations and
therefore reveal dynamical magnetic fluctuations. We apply the scheme to a
rare-earth compound LiHoF4 and calculate the echo signal, which is related to
the quantum fluctuations of the system. We observe enhanced signals at the

a broad range of spin systems, including cold atoms, quantum dots, solid-state
impurities, and transparent magnetic materials.

localised particle rearrangements take place in the midst of a more or less
homogeneously deforming medium. Recently, experimental as well as numerical
work has revealed spatial correlations between these flow heterogeneities.
Here, we use molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to characterise the
rearrangements and systematically probe their correlations both in time and in
space. In particular, these correlations display a four-fold azimuthal symmetry
characteristic of shear stress redistribution in an elastic medium and we
unambiguously detect their increase in range with time. With increasing shear
rate, correlations become shorter-ranged and more isotropic. In addition, we
study a coarse-grained model motivated by the observed flow characteristics and
challenge its predictions directly with the MD simulations. While the model
captures both macroscopic and local properties rather satisfactorily, the
agreement with respect to the spatiotemporal correlations is at most
qualitative. The discrepancies provide important insight into relevant physics
that is missing in all related coarse-grained models that have been developed
for the flow of amorphous materials so far, namely the finite shear wave
velocity and the impact of elastic heterogeneities on stress redistribution.

naturalness, grand unification and dark matter candidate seems to possess one
more attractive feature: it may trigger, through its own spontaneous violation
in the visible sector, a dynamical generation of gauge fields as massless
Nambu-Goldstone modes during which physical Lorentz invariance itself is
ultimately preserved. We consider the supersymmetric QED model extended by an
arbitrary polynomial potential of massive vector superfield that breaks gauge
invariance in the SUSY invariant phase. However, the requirement of vacuum
stability in such class of models makes both supersymmetry and Lorentz
invariance to become spontaneously broken. As a consequence, massless photino
and photon appear as the corresponding Nambu-Goldstone zero modes in an
emergent SUSY QED, and also a special gauge invariance is simultaneously
generated. Due to this invariance all observable relativistically noninvariant
effects appear to be completely cancelled out among themselves and physical
Lorentz invariance is recovered. Nevertheless, such theories may have an
inevitable observational evidence in terms of the goldstino-photino like state
presented in the low-energy particle spectrum. Its study is of a special
interest for this class of SUSY models that, apart from some indication of an
emergence nature of QED and the Standard Model, may appreciably extend the
scope of SUSY breaking physics being actively studied in recent years.

of the procedure, based on robust statistical tools (Monte Carlo sampling for
error propagation, neural networks for PDF parametrization, genetic algorithm
for their minimization, and possibly reweighting for including new data samples

are obtained at next-to-leading order accuracy in perturbative quantum
chromodynamics, based on both fixed-target inclusive deeply-inelastic
scattering data and the most recent polarized collider data. A quantitative
appraisal on the potential role of future measurements at an Electron-Ion

variation of several theoretical and methodological assumptions and we present
a detailed investigation of the first moments of our polarized PDFs, compared

distribution from available data was substantially underestimated in previous
determinations; in particular, we emphasize that a large contribution to the
gluon may arise from the unmeasured small-x region, against the common belief
that this is actually rather small. We demonstrate that an Electron-Ion

decreasing tail at high mass surface densities. The first component is
attributed to the random distribution of gas which is modeled using a
log-normal function while the second component is attributed to condensed
structures modeled using a simple power-law. The aim of this paper is to
provide an analytical model of the PDF of condensed structures which can be

structures are considered to be either spheres or cylinders with a truncated
radial density profile at cloud radius r_cl. The assumed profile is of the form
rho(r)=rho_c/(1+(r/r_0)^2)^{n/2} for arbitrary power n where rho_c and r_0 are

obtained which either truncates (sphere) or has a pole (cylinder) at maximal
mass surface density. The PDF of spherical condensations and the asymptotic PDF
of cylinders in the limit of infinite overdensity rho_c/rho(r_cl) flattens for
steeper density profiles and has a power law asymptote at low and high mass
surface densities and a well defined maximum. The power index of the asymptote
Sigma^(-gamma) of the logarithmic PDF (Sigma x P(Sigma)) in the limit of high

related to the increase of noise intensity, but the actual condition for
failure can be cast in qualitative, rather than quantitative terms. We also
discuss how the fulfilment of the mean-field approximations affects the
statistics of the first return times for the local and global variables,
further exploring the link between the fulfilment of the quasi-independence
approximation and certain forms of synchronization between the individual
units.

We detect HCN, HNC, and CH3OH in both comets, together with the ion HCO+ in
comet ISON and a few weak unidentified lines in comet Lovejoy, one of which
might be assigned to methylamine (CH3NH2). The monitoring of the HCN J = 3-2
line showed a tenfold enhancement in comet ISON on November 14.4 UT due to an
outburst of activity whose exact origin is unknown, although it might be
related to some break-up of the nucleus. The set of CH3OH lines observed was
used to derive the kinetic temperature in the coma, 90 K in comet ISON and 60 K
in comet Lovejoy. The HNC/HCN ratios derived, 0.18 in ISON and 0.05 in Lovejoy,
are similar to those found in most previous comets and are consistent with an
enhancement of HNC as the comet approaches the Sun. Phosphine (PH3) was also
searched for unsuccessfully in both comets through its fundamental 1-0
transition, and 3 sigma upper limits corresponding to PH3/H2O ratios 4-10 times
above the solar P/O elemental ratio were derived.

neural circuits. In the excitatory case the instabilities of the system can be
completely captured by an usual linear stability (Lyapunov) analysis, on the
other hand the inhibitory networks can display the coexistence of linear and
nonlinear instabilities. The nonlinear effects are associated to finite
amplitude instabilities, which have been characterized in terms of suitable
indicators. For inhibitory coupling one observes a transition from chaotic to
non chaotic dynamics by decreasing the pulse width. For sufficiently fast
synapses the system, despite showing an erratic evolution, is linearly stable,
thus representing a prototypical example of Stable Chaos.

reduction of electron beam energy is under discussion since many years. Recent
successes in the dedicated R&D program allow to forecast a technical

is to provide sub-Angstrom FEL operation in CW and LP modes. In this paper we
perform a preliminary analysis of a possible operation of the European XFEL in
the hard X-ray regime in CW and LP modes with the energies of 7 GeV and 10 GeV,
respectively. We consider lasing in the baseline XFEL undulator as well as in a
new undulator with a reduced period. We show that, with reasonable requirements
on electron beam quality, lasing on the fundamental will be possible in

the anomalous dimension gamma_m =1, based on a holographic model which has a
naturally light technidilaton phi as a composite Higgs with mass m_phi simeq
125 GeV. The one-family model (with 4 weak-doublets) is taken as a concrete
example in such a framework, with the inputs being F_pi=v/2 simeq 123 GeV and
m_phi simeq 125 GeV as well as gamma_m=1. It is shown that technipion masses
are enhanced by the large anomalous dimension to typically O(1) TeV. We find a
correlation between the technipion masses and S^{(TC)}, the S parameter arising
only from the technicolor sector. The current LHC data on the technipion mass
limit thus constrains S^{(TC)} to be not as large as O(1), giving a direct
constraint on the technicolor model building. This is a new constraint on the
technicolor sector alone quite independent of other sector connected by the
extended-technicolor-type interactions, in sharp contrast to the conventional S
parameter constraint from the precision electroweak measurements.

manage the growing volume of multimedia data such as large scale video
classification and annotation, especially to organize those videos containing
human activities. Recently, manifold regularized semi-supervised learning
(SSL), which explores the intrinsic data probability distribution and then
improves the generalization ability with only a small number of labeled data,
has emerged as a promising paradigm for semiautomatic video classification. In
addition, human action videos often have multi-modal content and different
representations. To tackle the above problems, in this paper we propose
multiview Hessian regularized logistic regression (mHLR) for human action
recognition. Compared with existing work, the advantages of mHLR lie in three
folds: (1) mHLR combines multiple Hessian regularization, each of which
obtained from a particular representation of instance, to leverage the
exploring of local geometry; (2) mHLR naturally handle multi-view instances
with multiple representations; (3) mHLR employs a smooth loss function and then
can be effectively optimized. We carefully conduct extensive experiments on the
unstructured social activity attribute (USAA) dataset and the experimental
results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed multiview Hessian
regularized logistic regression for human action recognition.

edges connecting vertices. Graphs can be drawn on paper in various ways, but
until recently all published methods of drawing graphs have had undesirable
properties: (i) for graphs which are not plane embeddable, intersections
between the lines representing edges appear at points which are not vertices,
creating the appearance of vertices where none exist, (ii) vertex labels can be
placed inside vertex symbols, but there is no consistent, logical, and visually
clean place to put edge labels, and (iii) representations of large graphs are
visually dense and difficult to interpret. This paper describes a new
cartographic method of drawing graphs which solves all of these problems, and
has other advantages as well. Complements, comparisons and contrasts of graphs
are usually better shown cartographically than in node-link form.
