inflation as a phase transition from quantum gravity regime to the standard

question whether paths of minimal or extremal length can be found, for which
the Sagnac discrepancies are zero. This paper discusses the variational problem
of finding such ""isosynchronous"" paths on rotating discs and rotating spheres.
On a disc, the problem resembles the classical isoperimetric problem and the
paths turn out to be circular arcs. On a rotating sphere, however, between any

Nevertheless, the electronic structure of such species is a challenge for
ab-initio computational approaches because of the difficulties to correctly
describe the statical and dynamical correlation effects in presence of one or
more unpaired electrons. Only the highest-level quantum chemical approaches can
yield reliable characterizations of their molecular properties, such as binding
energies, equilibrium structures, molecular vibrations, charge distribution and
polarizabilities. In this work we use the variational Monte Carlo (VMC) and the
lattice regularized Monte Carlo (LRDMC) methods to investigate the equilibrium
geometries and molecular properties of oxygen and oxygen reactive species.
Quantum Monte Carlo methods are used in combination with the Jastrow
Antisymmetrized Geminal Power (JAGP) wave function ansatz, which has been
recently shown to effectively describe the statical and dynamical correlation
of different molecular systems. In particular we have studied the oxygen
molecule, the superoxide anion, the nitric oxide radical and anion, the
hydroxyl and hydroperoxyl radicals and their corresponding anions, and the
hydrotrioxyl radical. Overall, the methodology was able to correctly describe
the geometrical and electronic properties of these systems, through compact but
fully-optimised basis sets and with a computational cost which scales as
$N^3-N^4$, where $N$ is the number of electrons. This work is therefore opening
the way to the accurate study of the energetics and of the reactivity of large

$190~\textrm{GeV}$ pions scattering in the Coulomb field of a lead target,
$\pi^- \text{Pb} \rightarrow \pi^-\pi^-\pi^+ \text{Pb}$. Exchange of quasi-real
photons is selected by isolating the sharp Coulomb peak observed at momentum
transfer below $0.001~(\text{GeV}/c)^2$. Using a partial-wave analysis the
amplitudes and relative phases of the $a_2(1320)$ and $\pi_2(1670)$ mesons have
been extracted, and the Coulomb and the diffractive contributions have been
disentangled. Measuring absolute production cross sections we have determined
the radiative width of the $a_2(1320)$ to be $\Gamma_0(a_2(1320) \rightarrow
\pi\gamma) = (358 \pm 6_{\textrm{stat}} \pm 42_{\textrm{syst}})~\textrm{keV}$.

the radiative width of the $\pi_2(1670)$, where in this analysis the branching
ratio $\textrm{BR}^{\textrm{PDG}}_{f_2 \pi}=0.56$ has been used. We compare

Employing sampling theory, these deterministic finite-difference equations are
mapped reversibly on continuum equations describing a set of bandwidth limited
harmonic oscillators. They represent the Schroedinger equation. However,
modifications reflecting the bandwidth limit are incorporated, i.e., the
presence of a time (or length) scale. When this discreteness scale is taken to
zero, the usual results are obtained. Thus, the linearity of quantum mechanics
can be traced to the postulated action principle of such cellular automata and
its conservation laws to discrete ones. The cellular automaton conservation
laws are in one-to-one correspondence with those of the related quantum
mechanical model, while admissible symmetries are not.

problems, especially in computer graphics, are defined via quadrature over the

by Pillands and Cools (2005) and by Brandolini et al. (2013). This paper
presents two QMC constructions in the triangle with a vanishing discrepancy.
The first is a version of the van der Corput sequence customized to the unit
triangle. It is an extensible digital construction that attains a discrepancy
below 12/sqrt(N). The second construction rotates an integer lattice through an
angle whose tangent is a quadratic irrational number. It attains a discrepancy
of O(log(N)/N) which is the best possible rate. Previous work strongly
indicated that such a discrepancy was possible, but no constructions were

accuracy for integration of smooth functions. Both constructions also yield
convergent estimates for integrands that are Riemann integrable on the triangle

The objective of the present work was to generalize this model to the soil clay

that is, one without cracks; (ii) the superficial layer of aggregates, with
changed pore structure compared with the intraaggregate matrix; and (iii) soils
with sufficiently low clay content where there are large pores inside the
intraaggregate clay (so-called lacunar pores). The methodology is based on
detail accounting for different contributions to the soil volume and water
content during shrinkage. The key point is the calculation of the lacunar pore
volume variance at shrinkage. The reference shrinkage curve is determined by
eight physical soil parameters: (1) oven-dried specific volume; (2) maximum
swelling water content; (3) mean solid density; (4) soil clay content; (5)
oven-dried structural porosity; (6) the ratio of aggregate solid mass to solid
mass of intraaggregate matrix; (7) the lacunar factor that characterizes the
rate of the lacunar pore volume change with water content; and (8) oven-dried
lacunar pore volume. The model was validated using available data. The model
predicted value of the slope of the reference shrinkage curve in the basic
shrinkage area is equal to unity minus the lacunar factor value, and is between
unity and zero in the agreement with observations.

including the use of acoustic sensing devices, the over-reliance on the single

relatively little data. In contrast, we show that pseudo-acoustic optical
sensors can produce vastly superior data, that we can exploit additional
features, both intrinsic and extrinsic to the insect's flight behavior, and
that a Bayesian classification approach allows us to efficiently learn
classification models that are very robust to over-fitting. We demonstrate our
findings with large scale experiments that dwarf all previous works combined,
as measured by the number of insects and the number of species considered.

Computer technology has evolved in keeping with Moore's Law meeting those
desires; however those improvement have of late become both a boon and bane for
researchers. Computers are now capable of producing high speed data streams
containing terabytes of information; capabilities that evolved faster than
envisioned last century. Software to handle large scientific data sets has not
kept up. How much information might be lost through accidental mismanagement or
how many discoveries are missed through data overload are now vital questions.
An important new task in most scientific disciplines involves developing
methods to address those issues and to create software that can handle large

indexed, and searchable data from heterogeneous instrumentation for the
implementation of a strong data-driven materials development strategy. At the

aggregates grow by diffusive accretion of mass. Supersaturation is controlled
in such a way that the overall aggregate volume grows linearly in time.
Classical Ostwald ripening, which is recovered in the limit of vanishing
overall growth, constitutes an unstable solution of the dynamics. In the
presence of overall growth evaporation of aggregates always drives the dynamics
into a new, qualitatively different growth regime where ripening ceases, and
growth proceeds at a constant number density of aggregates. We provide a
comprehensive description of the evolution of the aggregate size distribution
in the constant density regime: the size distribution does not approach a
universal shape, and even for moderate overall growth rates the standard
deviation of the aggregate radius decays monotonically. The implications of
this theory for the focusing of aggregate size distributions are discussed for
a range of different settings including the growth of tiny rain droplets in
clouds, as long as they do not yet feel gravity, and the synthesis of

hitting the top of a beer bottle with a solid object, usually another bottle,
to trigger the foaming over of the former within a few seconds. Despite the
trick being known for long time, to the best of our knowledge, the phenomenon
still lacks scientific explanation. Although it seems natural to think that
shock-induced cavitation enhances the diffusion of CO$_2$ from the
supersaturated bulk liquid into the bubbles by breaking them up, the subtle
mechanism by which this happens remains unknown. Here we show that the overall
foaming-over process can be divided into three stages where different physical
phenomena take place in different time-scales, namely: bubble-collapse (or
cavitation) stage, diffusion-driven stage and buoyancy-driven stage. In the
bubble-collapse stage, the impact generates a train of expansion-compression
waves in the liquid that leads to the fragmentation of pre-existing gas
cavities. Upon bubble fragmentation, the sudden increase of the
interface-area-to-volume ratio enhances mass transfer significantly, which
makes the bubble volume grow by a large factor until CO$_2$ is locally
depleted. At that point buoyancy takes over, making the bubble clouds rise and
eventually form buoyant vortex rings whose volume grows fast due to the
feedback between the buoyancy-induced rising speed and the advection-enhanced
CO$_2$ transport from the bulk liquid to the bubble. The physics behind this
explosive process might also be connected to some geological phenomena.

are also unusual. We find that one dusty clump (size <2 pc) exhibits a strong
UV bump (extinction at 2175A), more than three standard deviation higher than

to rarefaction is >~ this energy. Compressive heating dominates during the
early phase of acceleration. The maximum energy injected into the corona by
type 2 spicules, defined as the energy flux in the upper chromosphere, may
largely balance total coronal energy losses in quiet regions, possibly also in
coronal holes, but not in active regions. It is proposed that magnetic flux
emergence in inter-granular regions drives type 2 spicules.

letting that the conditional density of $Y$ given $\mathbf{X}$ as a completely
unknown function and allowing its shape to change with the value of
$\mathbf{X}$. The number of predictors $p$ may be very large, possibly much
larger than the number of observations $n$, but the conditional density is
assumed to depend only on a much smaller number of predictors, which are
unknown. In addition to estimation, the goal is also to select the important
predictors which actually affect the true conditional density. We consider a
nonparametric Bayesian approach to density regression by constructing a random
series prior based on tensor products of spline functions. The proposed prior
also incorporates the issue of variable selection. We show that the posterior
distribution of the conditional density contracts adaptively at the truth
nearly at the optimal oracle rate, determined by the unknown sparsity and
smoothness levels, even in the ultra high-dimensional settings where $p$
increases exponentially with $n$. The result is also extended to the
anisotropic case where the degree of smoothness can vary in different
directions, and both random and deterministic predictors are considered. We
also propose a technique to calculate posterior moments of the conditional
density function without requiring Markov chain Monte Carlo methods.

and valleytronics devices. Due to spin splitting induced by spin-orbital
coupling (SOC), the non-equilibrium charge carrier imbalance between two
degenerate and inequivalent valleys to realize valley/spin polarization has
been successfully demonstrated theoretically and supported by optical
experiments. However, the generation of a valley/spin current by the valley
polarization in MX2 remains elusive and a great challenge. Here, within an
electric-double-layer transistor based on WSe2, we demonstrated a spin-coupled
valley photocurrent whose direction and magnitude depend on the degree of
circular polarization of the incident radiation and can be further greatly
modulated with an external electric field. Such room temperature generation and
electric control of valley/spin photocurrent provides a new property of
electrons in MX2 systems, thereby enabling new degrees of control for
quantum-confined spintronics devices.

hierarchy of all fermions, the second one is responsible for all mixings

subhalos near images of strongly lensed extended background galaxies.
Typically, only the most massive subhalos in the strong lensing region may be
detected this way. In this work, we show that strong lenses may also be used to
constrain the much more numerous population of lower mass subhalos that are too
small to be detected individually. In particular, we show that the power
spectrum of projected density fluctuations in galaxy halos can be measured
using strong gravitational lensing. We develop the mathematical framework of
power spectrum estimation, and test our method on mock observations. We use our
results to determine the types of observations required to measure the
substructure power spectrum with high significance. We predict that deep
observations ($\sim10$ hours on a single target) with current facilities can
measure this power spectrum at the $3\sigma$ level, with no apparent degeneracy
with unknown clumpiness in the background source structure or fluctuations from
detector noise. Upcoming ALMA measurements of strong lenses are capable of
placing strong constraints on the abundance of dark matter subhalos and the
underlying particle nature of dark matter.

the latter and compare to the conditions for having a confining Wilson line. We
demonstrate the relation in several examples. Superficially, it may seem that
certain confining field theories with a non-local high energy behaviour, like
the dual of D5 branes wrapping a two-cycle, do not admit the corresponding
phase transition. However, upon closer inspection we find that, through the
introduction of a regulating UV-cutoff, new eight-surface configurations
appear, that satisfy the correct concavity condition and recover the phase
transition in the entanglement entropy. We show that a local-UV-completion to
the confining non-local theories has a similar effect to that of the

clusters at hard X-ray energies has been undertaken with many instruments, with
most detections being either of low significance or controversial. Background
and contamination uncertainties present in the data of non-focusing
observatories result in lower sensitivity to IC emission and a greater chance
of false detection. We present 266ks NuSTAR observations of the Bullet cluster,
detected from 3-30 keV. NuSTAR's unprecedented hard X-ray focusing capability
largely eliminates confusion between diffuse IC and point sources; however, at
the highest energies the background still dominates and must be well
understood. To this end, we have developed a complete background model
constructed of physically inspired components constrained by extragalactic
survey field observations, the specific parameters of which are derived locally
from data in non-source regions of target observations. Applying the background
model to the Bullet cluster data, we find that the spectrum is well - but not
perfectly - described as an isothermal plasma with kT=14.2+/-0.2 keV. To
slightly improve the fit, a second temperature component is added, which
appears to account for lower temperature emission from the cool core, pushing
the primary component to kT~15.3 keV. We see no convincing need to invoke an IC
component to describe the spectrum of the Bullet cluster, and instead argue
that it is dominated at all energies by emission from purely thermal gas. The
conservatively derived 90% upper limit on the IC flux of 1.1e-12 erg/s/cm^2
(50-100 keV), implying a lower limit on B>0.2{\mu}G, is barely consistent with
detected fluxes previously reported. In addition to discussing the possible
origin of this discrepancy, we remark on the potential implications of this
analysis for the prospects for detecting IC in galaxy clusters in the future.

beta-Li2IrO3, where Ir^{4+} ions form a 3D network with each lattice site being
connected to three nearest neighbors. We focus on the influence of magnetic
frustration caused by the second-nearest neighbor spin interactions. Such
interactions are likely to be significant due to large extent of 5d orbitals in
iridates or other 5d transition metal oxides. In the classical limit, the
ground state manifold is given by line degeneracies of the spiral
magnetic-order wavevectors when J2/J1\gtrsim 0.17 while the collinear stripy
order is included in the degenerate manifold when J2/J1 = 0.5. Quantum
order-by-disorder effects are studied using both the semi-classical $1/S$
expansion in the spin wave theory and Schwinger boson approach. In general,
certain coplanar spiral orders are chosen from the classical degenerate
manifold for a large fraction of the phase diagram. Nonetheless quantum
fluctuations favor the collinear stripy order over the spiral orders in an
extended parameter region around J2/J1 = 0.5, despite the spin-rotation
invariance of the underlying Hamiltonian. This is in contrast to the emergence
of stripy order in the Heisenberg-Kitaev model studied earlier on the same
lattice, where the Kitaev-type Ising interactions are important for stabilizing
the stripy order. As quantum fluctuations become stronger, U(1) and Z2 quantum
spin liquid phases are shown to arise via quantum disordering of the Neel,
stripy and spiral magnetically-ordered phases. The effects of magnetic
anisotropy and their relevance to future experiments are also discussed.

We imaged a 950 arcmin$^2$ field down to a 1 sigma sensitivity of 0.7-1.3
mJy/beam to find 125 submillimeter galaxies (SMGs) with a signal to noise ratio
>= 3.5. Counterpart identification using radio and near/mid-infrared data was
performed and one or more counterpart candidates were found for 59 SMGs.
Photometric redshifts based on optical to near-infrared images were evaluated
for 45 SMGs of these SMGs with Spitzer/IRAC data, and the median value is found
to be z=2.4. By combining these estimation with estimates from the literature
we determined that 10 SMGs might lie within the large-scale structure at z=3.1.
The two-point angular cross-correlation function between LAEs and SMGs
indicates that the positions of the SMGs are correlated with the z=3.1

selectively in the high dense environment of the high redshift universe. This

merger trees, we show that spin swings are mainly driven by mergers along the
filamentary structure of the cosmic web, and that these events account for the
preferred perpendicular orientation of massive galaxies with respect to their
nearest filament. By contrast, low-mass galaxies (M_s<10^10 M_sun at redshift
1.5) undergoing very few mergers, if at all, tend to possess a spin well
aligned with their filament. Haloes follow the same trend as galaxies but
display a greater sensitivity to smooth anisotropic accretion. The relative
effect of mergers on spin magnitude is qualitatively different for minor and
major mergers: mergers (and diffuse accretion) generally increase the magnitude
of the angular momentum, but the most massive major mergers also give rise to a
population of objects with less spin left. Without mergers secular accretion
builds up the spin of galaxies but not that of haloes. It also (re)aligns
galaxies with their filament.

shortly before their explosion. The neutrino luminosities of the stellar core
of massive stars become larger as they get closer to the time of the core
collapse. As emitted neutrinos escape freely from the core, the core mass is
significantly reduced when the neutrino luminosity is large. If a star is near
the Eddington luminosity when the neutrino luminosity is large, the star can
exceed the Eddington luminosity because of the core neutrino mass loss. We
suggest that the stellar surface mass-loss rates due to the core neutrino
emission can be higher than 1e-4 Msun/yr from ~ 1 year before the core
collapse. The mass-loss rates can exceed 1e-2 Msun/yr in ~ 10 days before the
core collapse. This mass-loss mechanism may be able to explain the enhanced
mass loss observed in some supernova progenitors shortly before their
explosion. Even if the star is not close enough to the Eddington luminosity to
enhance mass loss, the star can still expand because of the reduced
gravitational force. This mechanism can be activated in Wolf-Rayet stars and it
can make hydrogen-poor, as well as hydrogen-rich, dense circumstellar media
observed in some supernovae.

characterized by steady rates of change, interrupted by sudden bursts.
Information diffusion in the form of cascades of post re-sharing often creates
such sudden bursts of new connections, which significantly change users' local
network structure. These bursts transform users' networks of followers to
become structurally more cohesive as well as more homogenous in terms of
follower interests. We also explore the effect of the information content on
the dynamics of the network and find evidence that the appearance of new topics

spreading through the network. The model can successfully predict which

attribute postulated or claimed for a long time.
  We prove that quantum indeterminism - formally modelled as value

measurements of value indefinite observables are unpredictable. The proof makes
essential use of a strengthened form of the Kochen-Specker theorem proven
previously to identify value indefinite observables. This form of quantum

compatibility with quantum mechanical predictions, non-contextuality, and the
value definiteness of observables corresponding to the preparation basis of a

that the unpredictability of individual measurements of a value indefinite

regions (MSFRs) is the absence of a reliable stellar chronometer to unravel
their complex star formation histories. We present a new estimation of stellar
ages using a new method that employs near-infrared (NIR) and X-ray photometry,
AgeJX. Stellar masses are derived from X-ray luminosities using the Lx - Mass
relation from the Taurus cloud. J-band luminosities are compared to
mass-dependent pre-main-sequence evolutionary models to estimate ages. AgeJX is
sensitive to a wide range of evolutionary stages, from disk-bearing stars
embedded in a cloud to widely dispersed older pre-main sequence stars. The
MYStIX (Massive Young Star-Forming Complex Study in Infrared and X-ray) project
characterizes 20 OB-dominated MSFRs using X-ray, mid-infrared, and NIR
catalogs. The AgeJX method has been applied to 5525 out of 31,784 MYStIX
Probable Complex Members. We provide a homogeneous set of median ages for over
a hundred subclusters in 15 MSFRs; median subcluster ages range between 0.5 Myr
and 5 Myr. The important science result is the discovery of age gradients
across MYStIX regions. The wide MSFR age distribution appears as spatially
segregated structures with different ages. The AgeJX ages are youngest in
obscured locations in molecular clouds, intermediate in revealed stellar
clusters, and oldest in distributed populations. The NIR color index J-H, a
surrogate measure of extinction, can serve as an approximate age predictor for
young embedded clusters.

estimator of pre-main sequence (PMS) stellar ages, AgeJX, derived from X-ray

individual ages and large spreads of age distributions for entire clusters, we
compute median ages and their confidence intervals of stellar samples within
annular subregions of the clusters. We find core-halo age gradients in both the
NGC 2024 cluster and ONC: PMS stars in cluster cores appear younger and thus
were formed later than PMS stars in cluster peripheries. These findings are
further supported by the spatial gradients in the disk fraction and K-band
excess frequency. Our age analysis is based on AgeJX estimates for PMS stars,
and is independent of any consideration of OB stars. The result has important
implications for the formation of young stellar clusters. One basic implication
is that clusters form slowly and the apparent age spreads in young stellar
clusters, which are often controversial, are (at least in part) real. The
result further implies that simple models where clusters form inside-out are
incorrect, and more complex models are needed. We provide several star
formation scenarios that alone or in combination may lead to the observed
core-halo age gradients.

strong interaction with light that can be exploited for building
phototransistors and ultrasensitive photodetectors. Here, we report on the
realization of light-emitting diodes based on vertical heterojunctions composed
of n-type monolayer MoS2 and p-type silicon. Careful interface engineering
allows us to realize diodes showing rectification and light emission from the

lowest approximation, two uncoupled harmonic oscillators are obtained that
govern the radial and vertical oscillations; the higher-order terms determine
non-linear phenomena and transition to chaotic motion through quasi-periodic
stages of the oscillatory motion. The radial profiles of frequencies of the
radial and vertical harmonic oscillations that are relevant also in the

tension of the string loops are determined. It is shown that the radial
profiles differ substantially from those corresponding to the radial and
vertical frequencies of the geodetical epicyclic motion; however, they have the
same mass-scaling and their magnitude is of the same order. Therefore, we are
able to demonstrate that assuming relevance of resonant phenomena of the radial

is to have a publicly accessible experimentation platform for the verification

  The choice of SMT is determined by the fact that it offers more expressive
logics than propositional logic, yet their solvers have been shown to perform
very well. The expressiveness of SMT logics allows us to implement symbolic
model checking thus avoiding the expansion of the complete state space of the
models during the verification.
  In order to reduce the complexity we transform the Scade programs into SMT
instances in two steps. First they are reduced to programs of a synchronous
data flow language Lama. This language has simpler semantics than Scade while
still preserving some of the programmer's abstractions. Next we interpret such
a Lama program as a system of quantifier free first-order formulas.
  The remaining abstractions in Lama can be used to simplify these systems.
This in turn could lead to speeding up the verification process and allowing
more properties to be verifiable.
  We implemented these transformations successfully in a software using
Haskell. This work is concluded by a comparison of this software to the

VOR-increase training, climbing fiber activity on one trial predicted changes

a motor memory. In contrast, during VOR-decrease training, there was no

Depending on the ratio of spin-orbit coupling and subband spacing,
electron-electron interactions can either increase or decrease anticrossing
gaps. When the anticrossings are closing due to a special combination of Rashba
and Dresselhaus spin-orbit couplings, their gap approaches zero as an
interaction dependent power law of the spin-orbit couplings, which is a
consequence of Luttinger liquid physics. Monitoring the closing of the
anticrossings allows to directly measure the related renormalization group
scaling dimension in an experiment. If a magnetic field is applied parallel to
the spin-orbit coupling direction, the anticrossings experience different
renormalizations. Since this difference is entirely rooted in electron-electron
interactions, unequally large anticrossings also serve as a direct signature of
Luttinger liquid physics. Electron-electron interactions furthermore increase

that various tungsten-nitride compounds WN$_x$ ($x$ > 1) will be
""ultra-compressible"" or ""superhard"", $i.e.$ as hard as or harder than diamond.
These compounds are predicted to have large bulk and shear moduli (> 200 GPa)
and to be elastically and vibrationally stable.
  Compounds with such desirable properties must be energetically stable against
decomposition into other compounds. This stability can only be found after the
determination of the convex hull for W$_x$N$_1$$_-$$_x$ lines which connect the
lowest enthalpy structures as a function of composition. The phase diagram of
the W-N structure is uncertain, both experimentally and computationally.
Complex van der Waals forces play a significant role in determining the
structure of solid N$_2$.
  Here we use high-throughput calculations to map out the convex hull and other
low energy structures for the W-N system. We find that the ground state of the
system is the NbO structure, and that the WN$_2$ structures found by Wang $et$
$al$. are also stable when the van der Waals forces are neglected. Other
proposed structures are above the convex hull of the W-N system. We show how
the choice of density functional influences the shape of the curve and the
structures that form the hull. In nitrogen-rich compounds, the choice of
functional can dramatically change the structural parameters and mechanical
behavior. Using any of the functionals, the bulk and shear moduli of the NbO
phase are comparable to the WN$_x$ compounds that have been claimed to be
ultra-compressible for superhard.

implemented as a simple O(n log n)-size sorting network, thereby providing a
solution to an open problem posed by Incerpi and Sedgewick in 1985. In
addition, Zig-zag Sort is a variant of Shellsort, and is, in fact, the first
deterministic Shellsort variant running in O(n log n) time. The existence of
such an algorithm was posed as an open problem by Plaxton et al. in 1992 and
also by Sedgewick in 1996. More relevant for today, however, is the fact that
the existence of a simple data-oblivious deterministic sorting algorithm
running in O(n log n) time simplifies the inner-loop computation in several
proposed oblivious-RAM simulation methods (which utilize AKS sorting networks),
and this, in turn, implies simplified mechanisms for privacy-preserving data
outsourcing in several cloud computing applications. We provide both
constructive and non-constructive implementations of Zig-zag Sort, based on the
existence of a circuit known as an epsilon-halver, such that the constant
factors in our constructive implementations are orders of magnitude smaller

residual uncertainties from the factorization/renormalization scale, PDFs and

universe from the first galaxies we can currently observe at z~6 down to
galaxies we see in the local universe. I further address how these changes
reveal galaxy formation processes that galaxy structural analyses can provide.
This review is pedagogical and begins with a detailed discussion of the major
methods in which galaxies are studied morphologically and structurally. This
includes the well-established visual method; Sersic fitting to measure galaxy
sizes and surface brightness profile shapes; non-parametric structural methods
including the concentration (C), asymmetry (A), clumpiness (S) (CAS) method, as
well as newer structural indices. Included is a discussion of how these
structural indices measure fundamental properties of galaxies such as their
scale, star formation rate, and ongoing merger activity. Extensive
observational results are shown demonstrating how broad galaxy morphologies and
structures change with time up to z~3, from small, compact and peculiar systems
in the distant universe to the formation of the Hubble sequence we find today.
This review further addresses how structural methods measure accurately the
merger history out to z~3. The properties and evolution of bulges, disks, bars,
and at z>1 large star forming clumps are also described, along with how
morphological galaxy quenching occurs. Furthermore, the role of environment in
producing structure in galaxies over cosmic time is treated. Alongside the
evolution of general structure, I also delineate how galaxy sizes change with
time, with measured sizes up to a factor of 2-5 smaller at high redshift at a
given stellar mass. This review concludes with a discussion of how galaxy
structure reveals the formation mechanisms behind galaxies, providing a new and
unique way to test theories of galaxy formation.

indicates the [O III]5007 equivalent width is 33.82 +- 0.39 Ang and the H beta
equivalent width is 0.32 +- 0.32 Ang , producing a formal [O III]5007/H beta
emission line ratio of 106 for a 3200 km/s measurement aperture covering the
full velocity width of the [O~III]5007 line. Within a narrower 600 \kms
aperture covering the highest luminosity velocity structure in the line
complex, we find O III]5007/H beta = 62. The measured O III]5007/H beta ratios
are significantly higher than can be produced in radiative models of the
emission line region with solar composition, and the confidence interval limits
exclude all but models which have gas masses much larger than those for a
single star. Therefore, we conclude that the region from which the [O~III]5007
emission originates is hydrogen-depleted relative to solar composition gas.
This finding is consistent with emission from an accretion-powered outflow
driven by a hydrogen-depleted donor star, such as a white dwarf, being accreted
onto a black hole.

teams have grown significantly in recent decades. We show that this is partly
due to the change in the character of team-size distribution. We explain these
changes with a comprehensive yet straightforward model of how teams of
different sizes emerge and grow. This model accurately reproduces the evolution
of empirical team-size distribution over the period of 50 years. The modeling
reveals that there are two modes of knowledge production. The first and more
fundamental mode employs relatively small, core teams. Core teams form by a
Poisson process and produce a Poisson distribution of team sizes in which
larger teams are exceedingly rare. The second mode employs extended teams,
which started as core teams, but subsequently accumulated new members
proportional to the past productivity of their members. Given time, this mode
gives rise to a power-law tail of large teams (10-1000 members), which features
in many fields today. Based on this model we construct an analytical functional
form that allows the contribution of different modes of authorship to be
determined directly from the data and is applicable to any field. The model
also offers a solid foundation for studying other social aspects of science,
such as productivity and collaboration.

argues that the only straightforward way to resolve the challenge is by
describing the absorbers as offer waves, and asserts that this is a previously
unnoticed aspect of the challenge for TI. This argument is refuted in two basic
ways: (i) it is noted that the Maudlin experiment cannot be meaningfully recast
with absorbers described by quantum states; instead the author replaces it with
an ordinary which-way experiment; and (ii) the extant rebuttals to the Maudlin
challenge in its original form are not in fact subject to the alleged flaws
that Lewis ascribes to them. This paper further seeks to clarify the issues
raised in Lewis' presentation concerning the distinction between quantum
systems and macroscopic objects in TI. It is noted that the latest, possibilist
version of TI (PTI) has no ambiguity concerning macroscopic absorbers. In
particular, macroscopic objects are not subject to indeterminate trajectories,
since they are continually undergoing collapse. It is concluded that the

antiferromagnetic order for samples in a compositional range from x=0.04-0.055,

increase in the particle-hole (Landau) damping. The latter effect is captured
by a simple itinerant model relating Co doping to changes in the hot spots of

First, the inconsistency versus uncertainty is reviewed with regard to the

are used to highlight the complexities especially with respect to energy and
water consumption. The need for specific representations and metric to
separately assess products and technologies is discussed. It is highlighted
that applying product-oriented approaches would result in abandoning or
disfavoring of new technologies that could otherwise help toward a better
world. Second, several believed-untouchable hot spots are highlighted to
emphasize on their importance and footprint. The list includes, but not limited
to, i) User Computer-Interfaces (UCIs), especially screens and displays, ii)
Network-Computer Interlaces (NCIs), such as electronic and optical ports, and
iii) electricity power interfaces. In addition, considering cross-regional
social and economic impacts, and also taking into account the marketing nature
of the need for many ICT's product and services in both forms of hardware and

technologies, and services is explored. Finally, the impact of smart management
and intelligence, and in general software, in ICT solutions and products is
highlighted. In particular, it is observed that, even using the same
technology, the significance of software could be highly variable depending on
the level of intelligence and awareness deployed. With examples from an
interconnected network of data centers managed using Dynamic Voltage and
Frequency Scaling (DVFS) technology and smart cooling systems, it is shown that
the unadjusted assessments could be highly uncertain, and even inconsistent, in
calculating the management component's significance on the ICT impacts.

that separates out network control functions from the underlying equipment and
is an increasingly trend to help enterprises build more manageable data centers
where big data processing emerges as an important part of applications. To
concurrently process large-scale data, MapReduce with an open source
implementation named Hadoop is proposed. In practical Hadoop systems one kind
of issue that vitally impacts the overall performance is know as the
NP-complete minimum make span problem. One main solution is to assign tasks on
data local nodes to avoid link occupation since network bandwidth is a scarce
resource. Many methodologies for enhancing data locality are proposed such as
the HDS and state-of-the-art scheduler BAR. However, all of them either ignore
allocating tasks in a global view or disregard available bandwidth as the basis
for scheduling. In this paper we propose a heuristic bandwidth-aware task
scheduler BASS to combine Hadoop with SDN. It is not only able to guarantee
data locality in a global view but also can efficiently assign tasks in an
optimized way. Both examples and experiments demonstrate that BASS has the best
performance in terms of job completion time. To our knowledge, BASS is the
first to exploit talent of SDN for big data processing and we believe it points
out a new trend for large-scale data processing.

representations have been proposed, considerable room for improvement is still
present. In this paper, we present a very easy-to-implement deep learning

greedy-filter-and-down-sample operation, which enables the training procedure
to be very fast and computation-efficient. In addition, the structure of
Pyramid CNN can naturally incorporate feature sharing across multi-scale face
representations, increasing the discriminative ability of resulting
representation. Our basic network is capable of achieving high recognition
accuracy ($85.8\%$ on LFW benchmark) with only 8 dimension representation. When
extended to feature-sharing Pyramid CNN, our system achieves the

and JSON objects to a named list. However, in practice a list is an awkward,
inefficient type to store and manipulate data. Most statistical applications
work with (homogeneous) vectors, matrices or data frames. Therefore JSON
packages in R typically define certain special cases of JSON structures which
map to simpler R types. Currently there exist no formal guidelines, or even
consensus between implementations on how R data should be represented in JSON.
Furthermore, upon closer inspection, even the most basic data structures in R
actually do not perfectly map to their JSON counterparts and leave some
ambiguity for edge cases. These problems have resulted in different behavior
between implementations and can lead to unexpected output. This paper
explicitly describes a mapping between R classes and JSON data, highlights
potential problems, and proposes conventions that generalize the mapping to
cover all common structures. We emphasize the importance of type consistency
when using JSON to exchange dynamic data, and illustrate using examples and
anecdotes. The jsonlite R package is used throughout the paper as a reference
implementation.

Theoretical parallels suggest the diversity of fishing fleets may have a

of fisheries, but this possibility has rarely been explored. Here I present
theoretical analyses showing that the diversity of m\'etiers - combinations of
technology, target species, and fishing grounds - and technical efficiencies in
a fishing fleet have important impacts on the productivity, profitability, and
ecological impacts of fisheries, particularly mixed-stock or multispecies

Diversification of technical efficiencies creates opportunities for larger

weak stocks in unmanaged fisheries. These results suggest that the potential

mission planning, reduction and analysis of the most precise astronomical
observations. The construction of such ephemerides is highly constrained by the
tracking observations, in particular range, of the space probes collected by
the tracking stations on the Earth. The present planetary ephemerides (DE,
INPOP, EPM) are mainly based on such observations. However, the data used by
the planetary ephemerides are not the direct raw tracking data, but
measurements deduced after the analysis of raw data made by the space agencies
and the access to such processed measurements remains difficult in terms of
availability.
  The first part of the study deals with the analysis of the Mars Global
Surveyor (MGS) tracking data. The tracking observations containing one-, two-,
and three-way Doppler and two-way range are then used to reconstruct MGS orbit
precisely. As a supplementary exploitation of MGS, we derived the solar corona
model and estimated the average electron density along the line of sight
separately for slow and fast wind regions. Fitting the planetary ephemerides,
including additional data which were corrected for the solar corona
perturbations, noticeably improves the extrapolation capability of the
planetary ephemerides and the estimation of the asteroid masses (Verma et al.,
2013). The second part of the thesis deals with the complete analysis of the
MESSENGER tracking data. This analysis improved the Mercury ephemeris up to two
order of magnitude compared to any latest ephemerides. Such high precision
ephemeris, INPOP13a, is then used to perform general relativity tests of
PPN-formalism. Our estimations of PPN parameters (? and ) are the most

Here, we used modeling and simulation to predict the crop phenotypic plasticity
resulting from the interaction of plant traits (G), climatic variability (E)
and management actions (M). We designed two in silico experiments that compared
existing and virtual sunflower cultivars (Helianthus annuus L.) in a target
population of cropping environments by simulating a range of indicators of crop
performance. Optimization methods were then used to search for GEM combinations
that matched desired crop specifications. Computational experiments showed that
the fit of particular cultivars in specific environments is gradually
increasing with the knowledge of pedo-climatic conditions. At the regional
scale, tuning the choice of cultivar impacted crop performance the same
magnitude as the effect of yearly genetic progress made by breeding. When
considering virtual genetic material, designed by recombining plant traits,
cultivar choice had a greater positive impact on crop performance and
stability. Results suggested that breeding for key traits conferring plant
plasticity improved cultivar global adaptation capacity whereas increasing
genetic diversity allowed to choose cultivars with distinctive traits that were
more adapted to specific conditions. Consequently, breeding genetic material
that is both plastic and diverse may improve yield stability of agricultural
systems exposed to climatic variability. We argue that process-based modeling
could help enhancing spatial management of cultivated genetic diversity and
could be integrated in functional breeding approaches.

in a uniform magnetic field and in thermal equilibrium, the magnetization of an
electron gas in the classical Drude-Lorentz model vanishes identically. This
stems from classical statistics which assign the canonical momenta all values
ranging from $-\infty$ to $\infty$ what makes the free energy density
magnetic-field-independent. When considering a classical (Maxwell-Boltzmann)
interacting electron gas, it is usually admitted that the BvL theorem holds
upon condition that the potentials modeling the interactions are
particle-velocities-independent and do not cause the system to rotate after
turning on the magnetic field. From a rigorous viewpoint, when treating large
macroscopic systems one expects the BvL theorem to hold provided the
thermodynamiclimit of the free energy density exists (and the equivalence of
ensemble holds). This requires suitable assumptions on the many-body
interactions potential and on the possible external potentials to prevent the
system from collapsing or flying apart. Starting from quantum statistical
mechanics, the purpose of this article is to give, within the linear-response
theory, a proof of the BvL theorem in the semiclassical limit when considering
a dilute electron gas in the canonical conditions subjected to a class of
translational invariant external potentials.

modelling: a Fokker-Planck-like filtered kinetic equation proposed by Zaichik
et al. 2009 and a Kinetic-Based Moment Method (KBMM) based on a Gaussian
closure for the NDF proposed by Vie et al. 2014. The resulting Euler-like
system of equations is able to reproduce the dynamics of particles for small to
moderate Stokes number flows, given a LES model for the gaseous phase, and is
representative of the generic difficulties of such models. Indeed, it
encounters strong constraints in terms of numerics in the small Stokes number
limit, which can lead to a degeneracy of the accuracy of standard numerical
methods. These constraints are: 1/as the resulting sound speed is inversely
proportional to the Stokes number, it is highly CFL-constraining, and 2/the
system tends to an advection-diffusion limit equation on the number density
that has to be properly approximated by the designed scheme used for the whole
range of Stokes numbers. Then, the present work proposes a numerical scheme
that is able to handle both. Relying on the ideas introduced in a different
context by Chalons et al. 2013: a Lagrange-Projection, a relaxation formulation
and a HLLC scheme with source terms, we extend the approach to a singular flux
as well as properly handle the energy equation. The final scheme is proven to
be Asymptotic-Preserving on 1D cases comparing to either converged or
analytical solutions and can easily be extended to multidimensional
configurations, thus setting the path for realistic applications.

several advantages that seem to well align with the demands of grid computing.
Security and efficiency are the main objectives of grid authentication

protocols rely on the bilinear pairing, that is extremely computational
expensive. In this paper, we analyze the recently secure certificateless key
agreement protocols without pairing. We then propose a novel grid pairing-free

that it is robust with respect to network topology. Thus, the social network
and the local interactions are a prerequisite for generating the pattern, but
not the network topology itself. We further extend the model with a parameter
$\delta$ that weights the relative fraction of an individual's neighbours
belonging to a given organization, representing a contextual aspect of social
influence. In the lower limit of this parameter, the fraction is irrelevant and
choice of organization is random. In the upper limit of the parameter, the
largest fraction quickly dominates, leading to a winner-takes-all situation. We
recover the real pattern as an intermediate case between these two extremes.

Earth orbit by the Interstellar Boundary Explorer (IBEX) has suggested that the
interstellar velocity (both direction and magnitude) is inconsistent with that
derived previously from Ulysses/GAS observations made in the period from 1990
to 2002 at 1.5-5.5 AU from the Sun. Both results are model-dependent and models
that were used in the analyses are different. In this paper, we perform an
analysis of the Uysses/GAS and IBEX-Lo data using our state-of-the-art 3D
time-dependent kinetic model of interstellar atoms in the heliosphere. For the
first time we analyze Ulysses/GAS data from year 2007, the closest available
Ulysses/GAS observations in time to the IBEX observations.
  We show that the interstellar velocity derived from the Ulysses 2007 data is
consistent with previous Ulysses results and does not agree with the velocity
derived from IBEX. This conclusion is very robust since, as is shown in the
paper, it does not depend on the ionization rates adopted in theoretical
models.
  We conclude that Ulysses data are not consistent with the new LISM velocity
vector from IBEX. In contrast, IBEX data, in principle, could be explained with
the LISM velocity vector derived from the Ulysses data. This is possible for
the models with the interstellar temperature increased from 6300 K to 9000 K.
There is a need to perform further study of possible reasons for the broadening
of the helium signal core measured by IBEX. This could be an instrumental
effect or due to unconsidered physical processes.

optimization has been the characterization of (weak) efficiency thorough Minty
and Stampacchia type variational inequalities. Several results have been proved
to extend those known for the scalar case. However, in order to introduce a
proper definition of variational inequality, some assumptions are usually made
that may eventually be questioned. We find two major drawbacks in the papers we
considered, that arise when defining generalized derivatives for vector-valued
functions. First, some authors introduce set-valued derivatives for
single-valued problems, thus completely changing the setting of the problem.
Second, when dealing with Dini-type derivatives, infinite elements may occurs.
The approach to handle this problem is not yet uniquely defined in the
literature, therefore, when considered, the definition proposed may seem
arbitrary. Indeed these problems are strictly related with the lack of a
complete order in the image space of a vector-valued function. We propose an
alternative approach to study vector optimization, by considering an set-valued
counterpart defined with values in a conlinear space. The structure of this
space allows to overcome the previous difficulties and to obtain variational
inequality characterization of weak efficiency as a straightforward application
of scalar arguments.

sense that they extend significantly beyond nearest neighbors---whose ground
states can be constructed analytically and have a simple matrix product state
representation. This enables the detailed study of ground state properties,
such as correlation functions and entanglement, in the thermodynamic limit. The
spin models presented here are closely related to lattice gases of strongly
interacting polar molecules or Rydberg atoms which feature an excluded volume
or blockade interaction. While entanglement is only present between spins that
are separated by no more than a blockade length, we show that non-classical
correlations can extend much further and analyze them through quantum discord.
We furthermore identify a set of seemingly critical points where the ground
state approaches a crystalline state with a filling fraction that is given by
the inverse of the blockade length. We analyze the scaling properties in the
vicinity of this parameter region and show that the correlation length
possesses a non-trivial dependence on the blockade length.

variational symmetries going back to Noether and in the theory of discrete
integrable systems. A $d$-dimensional pluri-Lagrangian problem can be described
as follows: given a $d$-form $L$ on an $m$-dimensional space, $m > d$, whose
coefficients depend on a function $u$ of $m$ independent variables (called
field), find those fields $u$ which deliver critical points to the action
functionals $S_\Sigma=\int_\Sigma L$ for any $d$-dimensional manifold $\Sigma$

is a discrete analogue of the Dirichlet energy, and solutions are called
discrete pluriharmonic functions. We classify linear pluri-Lagrangian systems

quantum optical experiments. However, the intrinsic multimode spectral-temporal
structure of pulsed PDC often poses a severe hindrance for the direct
implementation of the heralding of pure single-photon states or, for example,
continuous-variable entanglement distillation experiments. To get rid of
multimode effects narrowband frequency filtering is frequently applied to
achieve a single-mode behavior.
  A rigorous theoretical description to accurately describe the effects of
filtering on PDC, however, is still missing. To date, the theoretical models of
filtered PDC are rooted in the discrete-variable domain and only account for
filtering in the low gain regime, where only a few photon pairs are emitted at
any single point in time. In this paper we extend these theoretical
descriptions and put forward a simple model, which is able to accurately
describe the effects of filtering on PDC in the continuous-variable domain.
  This developed straightforward theoretical framework enables us to accurately
quantify the trade-off between suppression of higher-order modes, reduced
purity and lowered Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) entanglement, when narrowband
filters are applied to multimode type-II PDC.

the infrared response of cuprate superconductors in the superconducting-state

very similar to what has been observed for the cognate zigzag spin chain

spin gap upon Ca doping is independent of the interchain exchange coupling
$J'$. Our results therefore generally prove the appearance of a spin gap in an
antiferromagnetic Heisenberg spin chain induced by a local bond disorder of the
intrachain exchange coupling $J$. A low temperature upturn of 1/T$_1$ evidences
growing magnetic correlations. However, zero field muon spin rotation
measurements down to 1.5 K confirm the absence of magnetic order in this
compound which is most likely suppressed by the opening of the spin gap.

stellar wind whose driving mechanism is not understood well. Characterizing the
composition and thermal and dynamical structure of the outflow provides
constraints that are essential for understanding AGB evolution, including the
rate of mass loss and isotopic ratios.
  We modeled the CO emission from the wind of the low mass-loss rate
oxygen-rich AGB star W Hya using data obtained by the HIFI, PACS, and SPIRE
instruments onboard the Herschel Space Observatory and ground-based telescopes.
$^{12}$CO and $^{13}$CO lines are used to constrain the intrinsic
$^{12}$C/$^{13}$C ratio from resolved HIFI lines.
  The acceleration of the outflow up to about 5.5 km/s is quite slow and can be
represented by a beta-type velocity law with index 5. Beyond this point,
acceleration up the terminal velocity of 7 km/s is faster. Using the J=10-9,
9-8, and 6-5 transitions, we find an intrinsic $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C ratio of
$18\pm10$ for W Hya, where the error bar is mostly due to uncertainties in the
$^{12}$CO abundance and the stellar flux around 4.6 $\mu$m. To match the
low-excitation CO lines, these molecules need to be photo-dissociated at about
500 stellar radii. The radial dust emission intensity profile measured by PACS
images at 70 $\mu$m shows substantially stronger emission than our model
predicts beyond 20 arcsec.
  The initial slow acceleration of the wind implies inefficient wind driving in
the lower part of the envelope. The final injection of momentum in the wind
might be the result of an increase in the opacity thanks to the late
condensation of dust species. The derived intrinsic isotopologue ratio for W
Hya is consistent with values set by the first dredge-up and suggestive of an
initial mass of 2 M$_\odot$ or more. However, the uncertainty in the
main-sequence mass derived based on this isotopologic ratio is large.

bandwidth needed by the sensor, which becomes also an issue for the distributed
system TCP/IP communications. Since traffic volume is too high, 3D data has to
be compressed before it can be sent over the network. The solution consists in
selfcoding the Kinect data into RGB images and then using a standard multimedia
codec to compress color maps. Information from different sources is collected
into a central client computer, where point clouds are transformed to
reconstruct the scene in 3D. An algorithm is proposed to merge the skeletons
detected locally by each Kinect conveniently, so that monitoring of people is
robust to self and inter-user occlusions. Final skeletons are labeled and

attainment of the infimum as well as a minimality property. The main result is
a Minty type variational inequality for set optimization problems which
provides a sufficient optimality condition under lower semicontinuity

derivative for set-valued functions which is defined in terms of a ""lattice

scheme exploits the sparsity of the channel matrix for the effective selection
of a limited number of antennas. To this end, we compute a sparse channel
matrix by minimising the mean squared error. This optimisation problem is then
solved by the well-known orthogonal matching pursuit algorithm. Widely used
models for spatial correlation among the antennas and channel estimation errors

ultra-low-power sensors running on small batteries. BLE is described as a new
protocol in the official Bluetooth 4.0 specification. To design
energy-efficient devices, the protocol provides a number of parameters that
need to be optimized within an energy, latency and throughput design space. To
minimize power consumption, the protocol parameters have to be optimized for a
given application. Therefore, an energy-model that can predict the energy
consumption of a BLE-based wireless device for different parameter value
settings, is needed. As BLE differs from the original Bluetooth significantly,
models for Bluetooth cannot be easily applied to the BLE protocol. Since the
last one year, there have been a couple of proposals on energy models for BLE.
However, none of them can model all the operating modes of the protocol. This
paper presents a precise energy model of the BLE protocol, that allows the
computation of a device's power consumption in all possible operating modes. To
the best of our knowledge, our proposed model is not only one of the most
accurate ones known so far (because it accounts for all protocol parameters),
but it is also the only one that models all the operating modes of BLE.
Furthermore, we present a sensitivity analysis of the different parameters on
the energy consumption and evaluate the accuracy of the model using both
discrete event simulation and actual measurements. Based on this model,
guidelines for system designers are presented, that help choosing the right
parameters for optimizing the energy consumption for a given application.

skyrmions being mathematical objects - special types of topological solitons -
they can emerge in much broader contexts. Recently skyrmions were observed in
helimagnets, forming nanoscale spin-textures that hold promise as information
carriers. Extending over length-scales much larger than the inter-atomic
spacing, these skyrmions behave as large, classical objects, yet deep inside
they are of quantum origin. Penetrating into their microscopic roots requires a
multi-scale approach, spanning the full quantum to classical domain. By
exploiting a natural separation of exchange energy scales, we achieve this for
the first time in the skyrmionic Mott insulator Cu$_2$OSeO$_3$. Atomistic ab
initio calculations reveal that its magnetic building blocks are strongly
fluctuating Cu$_4$ tetrahedra. These spawn a continuum theory with a skyrmionic
texture that agrees well with reported experiments. It also brings to light a
decay of skyrmions into half-skyrmions in a specific temperature and magnetic
field range. The theoretical multiscale approach explains the strong
renormalization of the local moments and predicts further fingerprints of the
quantum origin of magnetic skyrmions that can be observed in Cu$_2$OSeO$_3$,
like weakly dispersive high-energy excitations associated with the Cu$_4$

Seyfert 1 galaxy PG1244+026 using all available spectral-timing information.
This object shows the standard switch between soft leading the hard band on
long timescales, to the opposite behaviour on short timescales. This is
interpreted as a combination of intrinsic fluctuations propagating down through
the accretion flow giving the soft lead, together with reflection of the hard
X-rays giving the soft lag. We build a full model of the spectral and time
variability including both propagation and reflection, and compare our model
with the observed power spectra, coherence, covariance, lag-frequency and
lag-energy spectra. We compare models based on a separate soft excess component
with those based on reflection dominated soft emission.
  Reflection dominated spectra have difficulty reproducing the soft lead at low
frequency since reflection will always lag. They also suffer from high
coherence and nearly identical hard and soft band power spectra in disagreement
with the observations. This is a direct result of the power law and reflection
components both contributing to the hard and soft energy bands, and the small
radii over which the relativistically smeared reflection is produced
transmitting too much high frequency power into the soft band.
  Conversely, we find the separate soft excess models (where the inner disc
radius is $>6R_g$) have difficulty reproducing the soft lag at high frequency,
as reflected flux does not contribute enough signal to overwhelm the soft lead.
However, reflection should also be accompanied by reprocessing and this should
add to the soft excess at low energies. This model can quantitatively reproduce
the switch from soft lead to soft lag seen in the data and reproduces well the
observed power spectra and other timing features which reflection dominated
models cannot.

  Method. We have carried out wide-field (0.4 deg$^2$) observations with an
angular resolution of 25.8 arcsec ($\sim$ 0.05 pc) in $^{13}$CO ($J$=1--0) and
C$^{18}$O ($J$=1--0) toward the Orion-A giant molecular cloud using the

  Results. Overall distributions and velocity structures of the $^{13}$CO and
C$^{18}$O emissions are similar to those of the $^{12}$CO ($J$=1--0) emission.
The optical depths of the $^{13}$CO and C18O emission lines are estimated to be
0.05 $<$ $\tau_{\rm ^{13}CO}$ $<$ 1.54 and 0.01 $<$ $\tau_{\rm C^{18}O}$ $<$

ratios between $^{13}$CO and C$^{18}$O, $X_{\rm ^{13}CO}$/$X_{\rm C^{18}O}$,

$\pm$ 0.10, which is a third larger than that the solar system value of 5.5.
The mean value of $X_{\rm ^{13}CO}$/$X_{\rm C^{18}O}$ in the other regions is
found to be 12.29 $\pm$ 0.02. The difference of the abundance ratio is most
likely due to the selective FUV photodissociation of C$^{18}$O.

use a detector with relatively poor (near 10-15%) energy resolution. A classic

measurements at ultrahigh count rate - up to 10$^6$ Hz. As a result an energy

collected in a month of live time measurements. Due to high statistics an upper

of multipartite quantum correlations in practical settings is limited by its
fragility under decoherence due to environmental interactions. Though there
exist protocols to protect bipartite entanglement under decoherence, the
implementation of such protocols for multipartite quantum correlations has not
been sufficiently explored. Here, we study the effect of local amplitude
damping channel on the generalized Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger state, and use a
protocol of optimal reversal quantum weak measurement to protect the
multipartite quantum correlations. We observe that the weak measurement
reversal protocol enhances the robustness of multipartite quantum correlations.
Further it increases the critical damping value that corresponds to
entanglement sudden death. To emphasize the efficacy of the technique in
protection of multipartite quantum correlation, we investigate two proximately
related quantum communication tasks, namely, quantum teleportation in a one
sender, many receivers setting and multiparty quantum information splitting,
through a local amplitude damping channel. We observe an increase in the
average fidelity of both the quantum communication tasks under the weak

of this work the traditional random sampling and stratified sampling techniques
have been used. At the next level the balanced stratified sampling with
variations as per the choice of the prognosis class labels have been tested.

using the breast cancer, respiratory cancer and mixed cancer data sets with
three traditional classifiers namely Decision Tree, Naive Bayes and K-Nearest

used as class labels for experimental comparisons. The results shows a steady
increase in the prediction accuracy of balanced stratified model as the sample

the practical application of cloaking devices. Here we report the design and
experimental demonstration of the first 3D broadband cloak capable of

to the knee ($E_{k}\sim 3\times 10^{15}$ eV) and on an extragalactic origin of
cosmic rays with energy above $\sim 10^{19}$ eV, the debate on the genesis of

mainly because of the ambiguity intrinsic in defining such a region. The energy
range between $10^{17}$ eV and $\sim 10^{19}$ eV is likely to be the place
where the transition from Galactic to extragalactic cosmic rays takes place.
Hence the origin of these particles, though being of the highest importance

using both exact diagonalization and self-consistent diagrammatic many-body
perturbation theory. The Hartree and self-consistent Born approximations used
in the present work are studied at different levels of self-consistency. The
governing equations are shown to exhibit multiple solutions when the
electron-phonon interaction is sufficiently strong whereas at smaller
interactions only a single solution is found. The additional solutions at
larger electron-phonon couplings correspond to symmetry-broken states with
inhomogeneous electron densities. A comparison to exact results indicates that
this symmetry breaking is strongly correlated with the formation of a bipolaron
state in which the two electrons prefer to reside on the same molecule. The
results further show that the Hartree and partially self-consistent Born
solutions obtained by enforcing symmetry do not compare well with exact
energetics, while the fully self-consistent Born approximation improves the
qualitative and quantitative agreement with exact results in the same symmetric
case. This together with a presented natural occupation number analysis
supports the conclusion that the fully self-consistent approximation describes
partially the bipolaron crossover. These results contribute to better
understanding how these approximations cope with the strong localizing effect
of the electron-phonon interaction.

luminosity, because with decreasing of luminosity, the source evolved from a
Cyg-like Z source, via a Sco-like Z source, to an atoll source. In the Cyg-like
interval, the positive correlations are mostly distributed on the HB, which is
not consistent with that of the Cyg-like Z source GX 5-1 and Cyg X-2 whose HBs
host ambiguous correlations and anti-correlations. From our spectral analyses,
it is found that the ratio of the hard emission to the soft emission basically
keeps unvaried from the HB to the hard vertex, which might result in the
positive correlation. Additionally, we compare the spectra in the third

electron tunneling is mainly affected by the change of the metal workfunction,

particular, since the position of the image charge plane for electrons leaving
the surface does not precisely coincide with the centroid of the induced
screening charge at the surface in response to the applied electric field, we
find an effective increase in the metal workfunction by $\Delta W \sim 0.01$

sufficiently large entropy is liftable. Our results extend those obtained in

Pixel-wise fit for Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes (ImPACT). The
reconstruction algorithm is based around the likelihood fitting of camera pixel
amplitudes to an expected image template. A maximum likelihood fit is performed
to find the best-fit shower parameters. A related reconstruction algorithm has
already been shown to provide significant improvements over traditional
reconstruction for both the CAT and H.E.S.S. experiments. We demonstrate a
significant improvement to the template generation step of the procedure, by
the use of a full Monte Carlo air shower simulation in combination with a
ray-tracing optics simulation to more accurately model the expected camera
images. This reconstruction step is combined with an MVA-based background
rejection.
  Examples are shown of the performance of the ImPACT analysis on both
simulated and measured (from a strong VHE source) gamma-ray data from the
H.E.S.S. array, demonstrating an improvement in sensitivity of more than a
factor two in observation time over traditional image moments-fitting methods,
with comparable performance to previous likelihood fitting analyses. ImPACT is
a particularly promising approach for future large arrays such as the Cherenkov
Telescope Array (CTA) due to its improved high-energy performance and
suitability for arrays of mixed telescope types.

curves defined over finite fields $K$, where $K$ can be a prime or a binary

curves which take in input two random points from two differents subgroups. In
other words, for a ginven elliptic curve $E$ defined over a finite field
$\mathbb{F}_q$ and two random points $P \in \mathcal{P}$ and $Q\in
\mathcal{Q}$, where $\mathcal{P}$ and $\mathcal{Q}$ are two subgroups of
$E(\mathbb{F}_q)$, our function extracts the least significant bits of the
abscissa of the point $P\oplus Q$ when $q$ is a large prime, and the $k$-first
$\mathbb{F}_p$ coefficients of the asbcissa of the point $P\oplus Q$ when $q =

are close to uniform.
  Our construction extends some interesting randomness extractors for elliptic
curves, namely those defined in \cite{op} and \cite{ciss1,ciss2}, when
$\mathcal{P} = \mathcal{Q}$. The proposed constructions can be used in any
