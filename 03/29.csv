presented. The central idea is the formation of a tree consisting of positive
odd numbers with number 1 as root. Functions for generating the tree from the
root are presented and paths from nodes to the root are given by modified
Collatz sequences (with the even numbers omitted). The Collatz problem is thus
reduced to showing that all positive odd numbers are present in the tree. The
main result is the proof of the boundedness of Collatz sequences. With the even
numbers omitted they either end up in the number 1 (convergence) or in a
repetitive cycle of numbers (divergence). The existence/non-existence of cycles
in Collatz sequences (with the even numbers omitted) is still an open question.

better. In galaxies, for instance, multiple-star systems are organised in a
hierarchical system. Then, governmental and company organisations are
structured using a hierarchy, while the Internet, which is used on a daily
basis, has a space of domain names arranged hierarchically. Since Artificial
Intelligence (AI) planning portrays information about the world and reasons to
solve some of world's problems, Hierarchical Task Network (HTN) planning has
been introduced almost 40 years ago to represent and deal with hierarchies. Its
requirement for rich domain knowledge to characterise the world enables HTN
planning to be very useful, but also to perform well. However, the history of
almost 40 years obfuscates the current understanding of HTN planning in terms
of accomplishments, planning models, similarities and differences among
hierarchical planners, and its current and objective image. On top of these
issues, attention attracts the ability of hierarchical planning to truly cope
with the requirements of applications from the real world. We propose a
framework-based approach to remedy this situation. First, we provide a basis
for defining different formal models of hierarchical planning, and define two
models that comprise a large portion of HTN planners. Second, we provide a set
of concepts that helps to interpret HTN planners from the aspect of their
search space. Then, we analyse and compare the planners based on a variety of
properties organised in five segments, namely domain authoring, expressiveness,
competence, performance and applicability. Furthermore, we select Web service
composition as a real-world and current application, and classify and compare
the approaches that employ HTN planning to solve the problem of service
composition. Finally, we conclude with our findings and present directions for
future work.

from time-series data of the nonlinear functional forms and associated
parameters of large-scale nonlinear networks. Recently, a nonlinear network
reconstruction problem was formulated as a nonconvex optimisation problem based
on the combination of a marginal likelihood maximisation procedure with
sparsity inducing priors. Using a convex-concave procedure (CCCP), an iterative
reweighted lasso algorithm was derived to solve the initial nonconvex
optimisation problem. By exploiting the structure of the objective function of
this reweighted lasso algorithm, a distributed algorithm can be designed. To
this end, we apply the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) to
decompose the original problem into several subproblems. To illustrate the
effectiveness of the proposed methods, we use our approach to identify a
network of interconnected Kuramoto oscillators with different network sizes
(500~100,000 nodes).

the field correlations in the more general case of an arbitrary pre-quench
Hamiltonian, while keeping the post-quench one noninteracting. We first show
that in the previously studied special case of a noninteracting pre-quench

We then show that it is also valid in the general case of an arbitrary
interacting pre-quench Hamiltonian, but this time as a consequence of the
cluster decomposition property of the initial state, which is a fundamental
principle for generic physical states. For arbitrary initial states that do not
satisfy the cluster decomposition property, the above conjecture is not
generally true. As a byproduct of our investigation we obtain an analytical
derivation of earlier numerical results for the large time evolution of
correlations after a quantum quench of the interaction in the Lieb-Liniger

thermal driving, must be several times its value at the linear onset of
convection; this corresponds to Reynolds numbers, based on the convective

the convective structures must be strong. This requires that the local Rossby

$\lesssim 0.15$. Simulations in which certain wavenumbers are artificially

source orientation, observed field type (magnetic or electric), (non-zero)
frequency, and (non-zero) source-observer separation geometry. The proposed
algorithm exhibits robustness despite unique challenges arising for the fast
evaluation of such two-dimensional integrals. Herein, we develop the
mathematical treatment to rigorously evaluate the tail integrals using CGLQ and
discuss and address the specific issues posed to the CGLQ method when
anisotropic, layered media are present. To empirically demonstrate the CGLQ
algorithm's computational efficiency, versatility, and accuracy, we perform a
convergence analysis along with two case studies related to modeling of
electromagnetic resistivity tools employed in geophysical prospection of
layered, anisotropic Earth media and validating the ability of isoimpedance
substrates to enhance the radiation performance of planar antennas placed in
close proximity to metallic ground planes.

of the scattered electromagnetic field excited by distributed sources embedded
in planar-layered environments, where each layer may exhibit arbitrary and
independent electrical and magnetic anisotropic response and loss profiles.
This stands in contrast to many standard spectral-domain algorithms that are
restricted to computing the fields radiated by Hertzian dipole sources in
planar-layered environments where the media possess azimuthal-symmetric
material tensors (i.e., isotropic, and certain classes of uniaxial, media).
Although computing the scattered field, particularly when due to distributed
sources, appears (from the analytical perspective, at least) relatively
straightforward, different procedures within the computation chain, if not
treated carefully, are inherently susceptible to numerical instabilities and
(or) accuracy limitations due to the potential manifestation of numerically
overflown and (or) numerically unbalanced terms entering the chain. Therefore,
primary emphasis herein is given to effecting these tasks in a numerically
stable and robust manner for all ranges of physical parameters. After
discussing the causes behind, and means to mitigate, these sources of numerical
instability, we validate the algorithm's performance against closed-form
solutions. Finally, we validate and illustrate the applicability of the
proposed algorithm in case studies concerning active remote sensing of marine
hydrocarbon reserves embedded deep within lossy, planar-layered media.

kpc observed in the first six months of the Gaia-ESO Survey. Located in the
inner Galactic disk, NGC 4815 is an important tracer of the abundance gradient,
where few intermediate age open clusters are found. We use the survey derived
radial velocities, stellar atmospheric parameters, metallicity, and elemental
abundances for stars targeted as potential members of this cluster to carry out
an analysis of cluster properties. The radial velocity distribution of stars in
the cluster field is used to define the cluster systemic velocity and derive
likely cluster membership for stars observed by the Gaia-ESO Survey. We
investigate the distributions of Fe and Fe-peak elements, alpha-elements, and
the light elements Na and Al and characterize the cluster's internal chemical
homogeneity comparing it to the properties of radial velocity non-member stars.
Utilizing these cluster properties, the cluster color-magnitude diagram is
analyzed and theoretical isochrones are fit to derive cluster reddening,
distance, and age. NGC 4815 is found to have a mean [Fe/H]=+0.03. Elemental
abundances of cluster members show typically small internal variation, with
internal dispersions of ~0.05 dex. [Ca/Fe] and [Si/Fe] show solar ratios, but
[Mg/Fe] is moderately enhanced, while [Ti/Fe] appears slightly deficient. As
with many open clusters, [Na/Fe] and [Al/Fe] are enhanced, [Na/Fe]
significantly so, although the role of internal mixing and the assumption of
LTE in the analysis remain to be investigated. From isochrone fits to
color-magnitude diagrams, we find a cluster age of 0.5 to 0.63 Gyr, a reddening
of E(B-V) = 0.59 to 0.65, and a true distance modulus (m-M) = 11.95 to 12.20,

  To be more illustrative we are often addressed to the two-component chiral

describing the phantom field with interaction to a canonical scalar field is
analyzed in details. New generalized model of quintom character is proposed and
exact solutions are founded out.
  In the review we represented the perturbation theory for chiral cosmological

achieved in the inflation theory. It was shown that cosmological perturbations
from chiral fields can be decomposed for inflaton and the dark sector
perturbations. The two-component model is investigated in details, the general
solution for shortwave approximation is obtained and analyzed for power law

  New issue for understanding the features of Universe evolution is proposed by
consideration of the dark sector fields on the inflaton background. The results
are illustrated for the solutions in the long-wave approximation.

reached a precision that is akin to that of the LEP precision measurements.
This level of precision calls for the evaluation of the annihilation cross
sections of dark matter that goes beyond tree-level calculations as currently
implemented in all codes for the computation of the relic density. In
supersymmetry radiative corrections are known to be large and thus must be
implemented. Full one-loop radiative corrections for many annihilation
processes have been performed. It is important to investigate whether the bulk
of these corrections can be parameterised through an improved Born
approximation that can be implemented as a selection of form factors to a
tree-level code. This paper is a second in a series that addresses this issue.
After having provided these form factors for the annihilation of the
neutralinos into fermions, which cover the case of a bino-like LSP (Lightest
Supersymmetric Particle), we turn our attention here to a higgsino-like dark
matter candidate through its annihilation into $ZZ$. We also investigate the
cases of a mixed LSP. In all cases we compare the performance of the form
factor approach with the result of a full one-loop correction. We also study
the issue of the renormalisation scheme dependence. An illustration of the
phenomenon of non decoupling of the heavy sfermions that takes place for the
annihilation of the lightest neutralino into $ZZ$ is also presented.

the gain features of dye-doped polymer thin films. In particular we introduce
the gain efficiency $K$, in order to facilitate comparison between different
materials and experimental conditions. The gain efficiency was measured with
various setups (pump-probe amplification, variable stripe length method, laser
thresholds) in order to study several factors which modify the actual gain of a
layer, namely the confinement factor, the pump polarization, the molecular
anisotropy, and the re-absorption. For instance, for a 600 nm thick 5 wt\% DCM
doped PMMA layer, the different experimental approaches give a consistent value
$K\simeq$ 80 cm.MW$^{-1}$. On the contrary, the usual model predicting the gain
from the characteristics of the material leads to an overestimation by two
orders of magnitude, which raises a serious problem in the design of actual
devices. In this context, we demonstrate the feasibility to infer the gain
efficiency from the laser threshold of well-calibrated devices. Besides,
temporal measurements at the picosecond scale were carried out to support the

kpc to 6 kpc. We also find a decrease in concentration of ~0.07 (1.9 <
$C_{3000}$ < 3.9). The lack of a strong relationship between $r_{50}$ and
wavelength is consistent with a model in which clumpy star formation is
distributed over length scales comparable to the galaxy's rest-frame optical
light. While the wavelength dependence of $r_{50}$ is independent of size at
all redshifts, concentration decreases more sharply in the far-UV (~1500 \AA)
for large galaxies at z ~ 1. This decrease in concentration is caused by a
flattening of the inner ~20% of the light profile in disk-like galaxies,
indicating that the central regions have different UV colors than the rest of
the galaxy. We interpret this as a bulge component with older stellar

photoinduced absorption measurements to compare nongeminate recombination
behavior in films of neat poly(3-hexyl thiophene) (P3HT) and P3HT blended with
[6,6]-phenyl-C61 butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM). Transient measurements show
that carrier recombination in the neat P3HT film exhibits second-order decay
with a recombination rate coefficient that is similar to that predicted by
Langevin theory. In addition, temperature dependent measurements indicate that
neat films exhibit recombination behavior consistent with the Gaussian disorder
model. In contrast, the P3HT:PCBM blend films are characterized by a strongly
reduced recombination rate and an apparent recombination order greater than
two. We then assess a number of previously proposed explanations for this
behavior, including phase separation, carrier concentration dependent mobility,
non-encounter limited recombination, and interfacial states. In the end, we
propose a model in which pure domains with a Gaussian density of states are
separated by a mixed phase with an exponential density of states. We find that
such a model can explain both the reduced magnitude of the recombination rate
and the high order recombination kinetics and, based on the current state of
knowledge, is the most consistent with experimental observations.

transmit their local posteriors to other agents in the network, and finally
each agent combines its set of received local posteriors. The key insight in
this work is that, for many Bayesian models, approximate inference schemes
destroy symmetry and dependencies in the model that are crucial to the correct
application of Bayes' rule when combining the local posteriors. The proposed
method addresses this issue by including an additional optimization step in the

several options can be good at the same time. We explore a more general model
of decision-making that instead estimates the probability that each option is

genomic data, and data volumes are growing rapidly. Bioinformatic analysis
pipelines are having trouble keeping pace. A common bottleneck in such
pipelines is the requirement to read, write, sort and compress large BAM files
multiple times.
  Results: We present SAMBLASTER, a tool that reduces the number of times such
costly operations are performed. SAMBLASTER is designed to mark duplicates in
read-sorted SAM files as a piped post-pass on DNA aligner output before it is
compressed to BAM. In addition, it can simultaneously output into separate
files the discordant read-pairs and/or split-read mappings used for structural
variant calling. As an alignment post-pass, its own runtime overhead is
negligible, while dramatically reducing overall pipeline complexity and
runtime. As a stand-alone duplicate marking tool, it performs significantly
better than PICARD or SAMBAMBA in terms of both speed and memory usage, while
achieving nearly identical results.

pressure thresholds leading to regime changes are particularly important
quantities in flute-like instruments. In this paper, a comparison of such
thresholds between an artificial mouth, an experienced flutist and a non player
is provided. It highlights the ability of the experienced player to
considerabily shift regime change thresholds, and thus to enlarge its control
in terms of nuances and spectrum. Based on recent works on other wind
instruments and on the theory of dynamic bifurcations, the hypothe- sis is
tested experimentally and numerically that the dynamics of the blowing pressure
influences regime change thresholds. The results highlight the strong influence
of this parameter on thresholds, suggesting its wide use by experienced
musicians. Starting from these observations and from an analysis of a physical
model of flute-like instruments, involving numerical continuation methods and
Floquet stability analysis, a phenomenological modelling of regime change is
proposed and validated. It allows to predict the regime change thresholds in
the dynamic case, in which time variations of the blowing pressure are taken

function depend on both types: each player is thus partially informed about the
differential game that is played. The existence of the value function and some
characterizations have been obtained under the assumption that the signals are
drawn independently. In this paper, we drop this assumption and extend these
two results to the general case of correlated types. This result is then

sources spinning at frequencies above a few hundred Hertz can be unstable to

amplitude is insensitive to the structural properties of individual sources. We
find that this refined bound limits the gravitational wave strain from
millisecond pulsars to values below the detection sensitivity of

on these Dirac fermions and creates pseudo-Landau orbitals without breaking
time-reversal symmetry. We predict the realization of this phenomenon in IV-VI
semiconductor heterostructures, due to a naturally occurring misfit dislocation
array at the interface that produces a periodically varying strain field.
Remarkably, the zero-energy Landau orbitals form a flat band in the vicinity of
the Dirac point, and coexist with a network of snake states at higher energy.
We propose that the high density of states of this flat band gives rise to
interface superconductivity observed in IV-VI semiconductor multilayers at
unusually high temperatures, with non-BCS behavior. Our work demonstrates a new
route to altering macroscopic electronic properties to achieve a partially flat
band, and paves the way for realizing novel correlated states of matter.

a group, HUDFJ0332.5-2747.3 at $z =1.90 \pm 0.01$. Assuming viralization, the
velocity dispersion of HUDFJ0332.4-2746.6 implies a mass of $M_{200}= (2.2 \pm
1.8) \times 10^{14} M_{\odot}$, consistent with the lack of extended X-ray
emission. Neither overdensity shows evidence of a red sequence. About $50\%$ of
their members show interactions and/or disturbed morphologies, which are
signatures of merger remnants or disk instability. Most of their ETGs have blue
colors and show recent star-formation. These observations reveal for the first
time large fractions of spectroscopically confirmed star-forming blue ETGs in
proto-clusters at $z\approx 2$. These star-forming ETGs are most likely among
the progenitors of the quiescent population in clusters at more recent epochs.
Their mass-size relation is consistent with that of passive ETGs in clusters at
$z\sim0.7-1.5$. If these galaxies are the progenitors of cluster ETGs at these
lower redshifts, their size would evolve according to a similar mass-size
relation. It is noteworthy that quiescent ETGs in clusters at $z=1.8-2$ also do
not show any significant size evolution over this redshift range, contrary to
field ETGs. The ETG fraction is $\lesssim 50\%$, compared to the typical
quiescent ETG fraction of $\approx 80\%$ in cluster cores at $z< 1$. The
fraction, masses, and colors of the newly discovered ETGs imply that other
cluster ETGs will be formed/accreted at a later time.

used to construct halo merger trees, we are able to trace individual voids back
to their initial appearance and record the merging and evolution of their
progenitors at high redshift. For the scales of void sizes captured in our
simulation, we find that the void formation rate peaks at scale factor 0.3,
which coincides with a growth in the void hierarchy and the emergence of dark
energy. Voids of all sizes appear at all scale factors, though the median
initial void size decreases with time. When voids become detectable they have
nearly their present-day volumes. Almost all voids have relatively stable
growth rates and suffer only infrequent minor mergers. Dissolution of a void
via merging is very rare. Instead, most voids maintain their distinct identity
as annexed subvoids of a larger parent. The smallest voids are collapsing at
the present epoch, but void destruction ceases after scale factor 0.3. In
addition, voids centers tend to move very little, less than 0.01 of their
effective radii per ln a, over their lifetimes. Overall, most voids exhibit

equal to an integer multiple of the orbital period of their close planet. We
expand this list by analyzing Kepler data of HAT-P-11 and finding a period
ratio of 6:1. In particular, we present evidence for a long-lived spot on the
stellar surface that is eclipsed by the planet in the same position four times,
every sixth transit. We also identify minima in the out-of-transit lightcurve
and confirm that their phase with respect to the stellar rotation is mostly
stationary for the 48-month timeframe of the observations, confirming the
proposed rotation period. For comparison, we apply our methods to Kepler-17 and
confirm the findings of Bonomo & Lanza (2012) that the period ratio is not
exactly 8:1 in that system. Finally, we provide a hypothesis on how
interactions between a star and its planet could possibly result in an observed
commensurability for systems where the stellar differential rotation profile
happens to include a period at some latitude which is commensurable to the
planetary orbit.

edge-on spiral galaxies, using detailed radiative transfer modeling of a
homogeneous sample of 12 galaxies selected from the CALIFA survey. Our
automated fitting routine, FitSKIRT, was first validated against artificial
data. This is done by simultaneously reproducing the SDSS $g$-, $r$-, $i$- and
$z$-band observations of a toy model in order to combine the information
present in the different bands. We show that this combined, oligochromatic
fitting, has clear advantages over standard monochromatic fitting especially
regarding constraints on the dust properties. We model all galaxies in our
sample using a three-component model, consisting of a double exponential disc
to describe the stellar and dust discs and using a S\'ersic profile to describe
the central bulge. The full model contains 19 free parameters, and we are able
to constrain all these parameters to a satisfactory level of accuracy without
human intervention or strong boundary conditions. Apart from two galaxies, the
entire sample can be accurately reproduced by our model. We find that the dust
disc is about 75% more extended but only half as high as the stellar disc. The
average face-on optical depth in the V-band is $0.76$ and the spread of $0.60$
within our sample is quite substantial, which indicates that some spiral
galaxies are relatively opaque even when seen face-on.

properties of gas in the simulated galaxies at $z=0$ for three different
phases: `cold', `hot' and HI, and compare our results with observations. The
amount of material in the hot halo ($M_{hot}\approx
4-5\times10^{10}\,$M$_{\odot}$), and the cold
($M_{cold}(r\lesssim10\,$kpc$)\approx10^{8}\,$M$_{\odot}$) and HI
($M_{HI}(r\lesssim50\,$kpc$)\approx 3-4\times10^8\,$M$_{\odot}$) components
display a reasonable agreement with observations. We also compute the
accretion/ejection rates together with the HI (radial and all-sky) covering
fractions. The integrated HI accretion rate within $r=50\,$kpc gives
$\sim$$0.2-0.3\,$M$_{\odot}\,$yr$^{-1}$, i.e. close to that obtained from
high-velocity clouds in the Milky Way. We find that the global accretion rate
is dominated by hot material, although ionized gas with $T\lesssim10^5\,$K can
contribute significantly too. The $net$ accretion rates of $all$ material at
the virial radii are $6-8\,$M$_{\odot}\,$yr$^{-1}$. At $z=0$, we find a
significant gas excess between the two galaxies, as compared to any other
direction, resulting from the overlap of their gaseous haloes. In our
simulation, the gas excess first occurs at $z\sim1$, as a consequence of the
kinematical evolution of the LG.

Cooper pairs have a nonzero center of mass momentum, inhomogeneous
superconducting states known as a pair-density-waves (PDW) states. We show that
in a system of spin-1/2 fermions in 2 dimensions in an electronic nematic spin
triplet phase where rotational symmetry is broken both in real and in spin
space PDW phases arise naturally in a theory that can be analyzed using
controlled approximations. We show that several superfluid phases that may
arise in this phase can be treated within a controlled BCS mean field theory,
with the strength of the spin-triplet nematic order parameter playing the role
of the small parameter of this theory. We find that in a spin-triplet nematic
phase, in addition of a triplet $p$-wave and spin-singlet $d$-wave (or $s$
depending on the nematic phase) uniform superconducting states, it is also
possible to have a $d$-wave (or $s$) PDW superconductor. The PDW phases found
here can be either unidirectional, bidirectional or tridirectional depending on
the spin-triplet nematic phase and which superconducting channel is dominant.
In addition, a triple-helix state is found in a particular channel. We show
that these PDW phases are present in the weak coupling limit, in contrast to
the usual Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov phases which require strong coupling
physics in addition to a large magnetic field (and often both).

potentially trigger nuclear activity. Since the inflowing material can obscure
the central regions of interacting galaxies, a potential limitation of previous
optical studies is that obscured Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs) can be missed at
various stages along the merger sequence. We present the first large
mid-infrared study of AGNs in mergers and galaxy pairs, in order to quantify
the incidence of obscured AGNs triggered by interactions. The sample consists
of galaxy pairs and post-mergers drawn from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey that
are matched to detections by the Wide Field Infrared Sky Explorer (WISE). We
find that the fraction of AGN in the pairs, relative to a mass-, redshift- and
environment-matched control sample, increases as a function of decreasing
projected separation. This enhancement is most dramatic in the post-merger
sample, where we find a factor of 10-20 excess in the AGN fraction compared
with the control. Although this trend is in qualitative agreement with results
based on optical AGN selection, the mid-infrared selected AGN excess increases
much more dramatically in the post-mergers than is seen for optical AGN. Our
results suggest that energetically dominant optically obscured AGNs become more
prevalent in the most advanced mergers, consistent with theoretical
predictions.

interference links, where both the secondary-to-primary and
primary-to-secondary channels have a Line-of-Sight (LoS) component. Based on a
Rician model for the LoS channels, we show, analytically and numerically, that
LoS interference hinders the achievable secondary user capacity. This is caused
by the poor dynamic range of the interference channels fluctuations when a
dominant LoS component exists. In order to improve the capacity of such system,
we propose the usage of an Electronically Steerable Parasitic Array Radiator
(ESPAR) antenna at the secondary terminals. An ESPAR antenna requires a single
RF chain and has a reconfigurable radiation pattern that is controlled by
assigning arbitrary weights to M orthonormal basis radiation patterns. By
viewing these orthonormal patterns as multiple virtual dumb antennas, we
randomly vary their weights over time creating artificial channel fluctuations
that can perfectly eliminate the undesired impact of LoS interference. Because
the proposed scheme uses a single RF chain, it is well suited for compact and
low cost mobile terminals.

gamma-ray emission from 4C +21.35 (PKS 1222+216) by MAGIC on 2010 June 17,
triggered by the high activity detected by the Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT)
in high energy (HE; E > 100 MeV) gamma-rays, poses intriguing questions on the
location of the gamma-ray emitting region in this flat spectrum radio quasar.
We present multifrequency data of 4C +21.35 collected from centimeter to VHE
during 2010 to investigate the properties of this source and discuss a possible
emission model. The first hint of detection at VHE was observed by MAGIC on
2010 May 3, soon after a gamma-ray flare detected by Fermi-LAT that peaked on
April 29. The same emission mechanism may therefore be responsible for both the
HE and VHE emission during the 2010 flaring episodes. Two optical peaks were
detected on 2010 April 20 and June 30, close in time but not simultaneous with
the two gamma-ray peaks, while no clear connection was observed between the
X-ray an gamma-ray emission. An increasing flux density was observed in radio
and mm bands from the beginning of 2009, in accordance with the increasing
gamma-ray activity observed by Fermi-LAT, and peaking on 2011 January 27 in the
mm regime (230 GHz). We model the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of 4C
+21.35 for the two periods of the VHE detection and a quiescent state, using a
one-zone model with the emission coming from a very compact region outside the
broad line region. The three SEDs can be fit with a combination of synchrotron
self-Compton and external Compton emission of seed photons from a dust torus,
changing only the electron distribution parameters between the epochs. The fit
of the optical/UV part of the spectrum for 2010 April 29 seems to favor an
inner disk radius of <6 gravitational radii, as one would expect from a
prograde-rotating Kerr black hole.

  discussion paper 663","cs.GT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Can noncooperative behaviour of merchants lead to a market split that prima
facie seems anticompetitive? We introduce a model in which service providers,
with ISPs being the main example, aim at optimizing the number of customers
using their services, while customers aim at choosing service providers with
low customer load (high bandwidth per subscriber, for ISPs). Each service
provider chooses between a variety of levels of service (latencies, for ISPs),
and as long as it does not lose customers, aims at minimizing its level of
service; the minimum level of service required to satisfy a customer varies
across customers. We consider a two-stage competition: in the first stage,
service providers select their levels of service; in the second stage,
customers choose between service providers. In the two-stage game, we show that
the competition among service providers possesses a unique Nash equilibrium,
which is moreover super-strong; we also show that sequential better-response
dynamics of service providers reach this equilibrium, with best-response
dynamics doing so surprisingly fast. If service providers choose their levels
of service according to this equilibrium, then the unique Nash equilibrium
among customers in the second phase is a split of the market between the
service providers, based on the customers' minimum acceptable quality of
service; moreover, each service provider's chosen level of service is the
lowest acceptable by the entirety of its market slice, seemingly making no
attempt to attract other customers. Our results show that this prima facie
market allocation (collusive split of the market) arises as the unique and
highly robust outcome of noncooperative, even myopic, service-provider
behaviour. These results are applicable to a wide variety of scenarios, from
explaining phenomena observable in food markets, to shedding a surprising light
on aspects of location theory.

pair-creation operator is a scalar product of vectors in the spin and spatial
degrees of freedom. While differing in the spatial part, most models have the
same spin part, which creates a qq* pair coupled to spin triplet, with the
spins of the initial quarks as spectators. This is a basic assumption of the
3P0 model, and is well-known to arise also in the flux tube model, starting
from the strong coupling expansion of lattice QCD. In this article the same
structure is shown to emerge in the Cornell model, in the dominant
contributions of a more general microscopic decay model, and in the
pseudoscalar-meson emission model. A solution is obtained for arbitrary matrix
elements in these ``non-flip, triplet'' models, expressed as a weighted sum
over spatial matrix elements. The coefficients in the expansion, which involve
the spin degrees of freedom and the associated angular momentum algebra, are
model-independent. Tables of the angular momentum coefficients are presented
which can be used in future calculations, avoiding tedious Clebsch-Gordan sums.
The symmetry and orthogonality properties of the coefficients are discussed, as
well as their application to transitions involving hybrid mesons and states of
mixed spin. New selection rules are derived, and existing ones generalised. The
coefficients lead to model-independent relations among decay amplitudes and
widths which can be tested in experiment and lattice QCD. They can also be used
to explain how mass shifts in the unquenched quark model do not spoil
successful predictions of the ordinary (quenched) quark model.

that the obtained film structure depends on both growth oxygen and temperature.
Thus, by finely controlling the deposition conditions, we could tune the strain

some debatable issues concerning the so-called Photometric Plane for bulges and
elliptical galaxies in different forms and various versions of the famous
Kormendy relation.
  We show that some of the correlations under discussion are artificial
(self-correlations), while others truly reveal some new essential details of
the structural properties of galaxies. Our main results are as follows:
  (1) At present, we can not conclude that faint stellar discs are, on average,
more thin than discs in high surface brightness galaxies. The ``central surface
brightness -- thickness'' correlation appears only as a consequence of the
transparent exponential disc model to describe real galaxy discs.
  (2) The Photometric Plane appears to have no independent physical sense.
Various forms of this plane are merely sophisticated versions of the Kormendy
relation or of the self-relation involving the central surface brightness of a
bulge/elliptical galaxy and the Sersic index n.
  (3) The Kormendy relation is a physical correlation presumably reflecting the
difference in the origin of bright and faint ellipticals and bulges.
  We present arguments that involve creating artificial samples to prove our
main idea.

transitions, in which formerly autonomous entities become parts of a novel
higher-level entity. One intriguing feature of the higher-level entity after
some major transitions is a division of reproductive labor among its
lower-level units. Although it can have clear benefits once established, it is
unknown how such reproductive division of labor originates. We consider a
recent evolution experiment on the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a unique
platform to address the issue of reproductive differentiation during an
evolutionary transition in individuality. In the experiment, independent yeast
lineages evolved a multicellular ""snowflake-like'' cluster form in response to
gravity selection. Shortly after the evolution of clusters, the yeast evolved
higher rates of cell death. While cell death enables clusters to split apart
and form new groups, it also reduces their performance in the face of gravity
selection. To understand the selective value of increased cell death, we create
a mathematical model of the cellular arrangement within snowflake yeast
clusters. The model reveals that the mechanism of cell death and the geometry
of the snowflake interact in complex, evolutionarily important ways. We find
that the organization of snowflake yeast imposes powerful limitations on the
available space for new cell growth. By dying more frequently, cells in
clusters avoid encountering space limitations, and, paradoxically, reach higher
numbers. In addition, selection for particular group sizes can explain the
increased rate of apoptosis both in terms of total cell number and total
numbers of collectives. Thus, by considering the geometry of a primitive
multicellular organism we can gain insight into the initial emergence of
reproductive division of labor during an evolutionary transition in
individuality.

denser than the fluid can remain trapped indefinitely in a bounded region of an
open fluid flow. Here, we investigate this counterintuitive phenomenon both
numerically and analytically to establish the conditions under which the
underlying particle-trapping attractors can form. We focus on a two-dimensional
open flow composed of a pair of vortices and its specular image, which is a
system we represent as a vortex pair plus a wall along the symmetry line.
Considering particles that are much denser than the fluid, we show that two
point attractors form in the neighborhood of the vortex pair provided that the
particle Stokes number is smaller than a critical value of order unity. In the
absence of the wall, the boundaries of the basins of the attracting points are
smooth. When the wall is present, the point attractors describe
counter-rotating ellipses in this frame, with a period equal to half the period
of one isolated vortex pair. However, their boundaries are shown to become
fractal if the distance to the wall is smaller than a critical distance that
scales with the inverse square root of the Stokes number. This transformation
is related to the breakdown of a separatrix that gives rise to a heteroclinic
tangle close to the vortices, which we describe using a Melnikov function. For
an even smaller distance to the wall, we demonstrate that a second separatrix
breaks down and a new heteroclinic tangle forms farther away from the vortices.
Particles released in the open part of the flow can approach the attractors and
be trapped permanently provided that they cross the two separatrices.
Furthermore, the trapping of heavy particles from the open flow is shown to be
robust to the presence of gravity, viscosity, and noise.

a fit of the differential asymmetry as a function of $q_{l}\eta_{l}$ (where
$q_{l}$ is the charge of the lepton from the cascade decay of the top quarks
and $\eta_{l}$ is the final pseudorapidity of the lepton in the detector frame)
to a hyperbolic tangent function can be used to extrapolate to the full
leptonic asymmetry. We find this empirical method to well reproduce the results
from current experiments, and present arguments as to why this is the case. We
also introduce two more models, based on Gaussian functions, that better model
the $q_{l}\eta_{l}$ distribution. With our better understanding, we find that
the asymmetry is mainly determined by the shift of the mean of the
$q_{l}\eta_{l}$ distribution, the main contribution to the inclusive asymmetry
comes from the region around $|q_{l}\eta_{l}| = 1$, and the extrapolation from
the detector-covered region to the inclusive asymmetry is stable via a
multiplicative scale factor, giving us confidence in the previously reported

distribution. The thick disc stars seem to lie in progressively thinner layers
above the Galactic plane, as metallicity increases and [alpha/Fe] decreases.
The thin disc population presents a constant value of the mean distance to the
plane at all metallicities. Our data confirm the already known correlations
between V_phi and [M/H] for the two discs. For the thick disc sequence, a study
of the possible contamination by thin disc stars suggests a gradient up to
64km/s/dex. The distributions of V_phi, V_Z, and orbital parameters are
analysed for the chemically separated samples. Concerning the gradients with
galactocentric radius, we find for the thin disc a flat behaviour of V_phi, a
[M/H] gradient of -0.058dex/kpc and a small positive [alpha/Fe] gradient. For
the thick disc, flat gradients in [M/H] and [alpha/Fe] are derived. Our
chemo-kinematical analysis suggests a picture in which the thick disc seems to
have experienced a settling process, during which its rotation increased
progressively, and, possibly, the V_phi dispersion decreased. At [M/H]-0.25dex
and [alpha/Fe]0.1dex, the mean characteristics of the thick disc in distance to
the Galactic plane, V_phi, V_phi dispersion and eccentricity agree with those
of the thin disc stars, suggesting a possible connection between these
populations at a certain epoch of the disc evolution.

thermodynamic and kinetic studies have been performed addressing the stability

field lag far behind. Although membrane proteins constitute about a third of
the proteins encoded in known genomes, stability studies on membrane proteins
have been impaired due to experimental limitations. Furthermore, no systematic
experimental strategies are available for folding these biomolecules in vitro.
Common denaturing agents such as chaotropes usually do not work on helical
membrane proteins, and ionic detergents have been successful denaturants only
in few cases. Refolding a membrane protein seems to be a craftsman work, which
is relatively straightforward for transmembrane {\beta}-barrel proteins but
challenging for {\alpha}-helical membrane proteins. Additional complexities
emerge in multidomain membrane proteins, data interpretation being one of the
most critical. In this review, we will describe some recent efforts in
understanding the folding mechanism of membrane proteins that have been
reversibly refolded allowing both thermodynamic and kinetic analysis. This

resolution to the Problem of Time that is Machian, which was previously
realized for relational triangle and minisuperspace models. This resolution has
three levels: classical, semiclassical and combined
semiclassical-histories-records. This article's specific model is a slightly
inhomogeneous cosmology considered for now at the classical level. This is
motivated by how the inhomogeneous fluctuations that underlie structure
formation - galaxies and CMB hotspots - might have been seeded by quantum
cosmological fluctuations, as magnified by some inflationary mechanism. In
particular, I consider the perturbations about $S^3$ case of this involving up
to second order, which has a number of parallels with the Halliwell-Hawking
model but has a number of conceptual differences and useful upgrades. The
article's main features are that the elimination part of the model's thin
sandwich is straightforward, but the modewise split of the constraints fail to
be first-class constraints. Thus the elimination part only arises as an
intermediate geometry between superspace and Riem. The reduced geometries have
surprising singularities influenced by the matter content of the universe,
though the N-body problem anticipates these with its collinear singularities. I
also give a `basis set' of Kuchar beables for this model arena.

directly adopt concept libraries not specifically designed for events. In this
paper, we propose to build Concept Bank, the largest concept library consisting
of 4,876 concepts specifically designed to cover 631 real-world events. To
construct the Concept Bank, we first gather a comprehensive event collection
from WikiHow, a collaborative writing project that aims to build the world's
largest manual for any possible How-To event. For each event, we then search
Flickr and discover relevant concepts from the tags of the returned images. We
train a Multiple Kernel Linear SVM for each discovered concept as a concept
detector in Concept Bank. We organize the concepts into a five-layer tree
structure, in which the higher-level nodes correspond to the event categories
while the leaf nodes are the event-specific concepts discovered for each event.
Based on such tree ontology, we develop a semantic matching method to select
relevant concepts for each textual event query, and then apply the
corresponding concept detectors to generate concept-based video
representations. We use TRECVID Multimedia Event Detection 2013 and Columbia
Consumer Video open source event definitions and videos as our test sets and
show very promising results on two video event detection tasks: event modeling
over concept space and zero-shot event retrieval. To the best of our knowledge,
this is the largest concept library covering the largest number of real-world
events.

remains elusive. To better elucidate the mechanism, a simulation study of

performed with GEANT4. It was found that unlike previously thought, a
$^3\mathrm{He}$ counter had a small sensitivity to high-energy gamma rays
because of inelastic interaction with its cathode-tube materials (Al or
stainless steel). A $^{3}\mathrm{He}$ counter with the intrinsic small
sensitivity, if surrounded by thick materials, would largely detect
thunderstorm-related gamma rays rather than those neutrons produced via
photonuclear reaction in the atmosphere. On the other hand, the counter, if
surrounded by thin materials and located away from a gamma-ray source, would
observe neutron signals with little gamma-ray contamination. Compared with the
Gurevich measurement, the present work allows us to deduce that the
enhancements are attributable to gamma rays, if their observatory was very
close to or inside a gamma-ray emitting region in thunderclouds.

star in a high mass X-ray binary. Our aim is to unveil a new principle
governing X-ray luminosities of X-ray binaries, with a simple analysis of fluid
equations simulating line-driven wind flow under influence of X-ray
irradiation. In this study, we solve equation of motion of the accretion flow
taking into account the line-driven acceleration and X-ray photo-ionization.
Under the influence of X-ray irradiation, we find the flow equations take two
types of solutions. The first solution is characterized by a slow wind velocity
which causes a large accretion rate. The second solution is a fast wind flow
which results in a small accretion rate. We find that only the solution with a
fast wind and faint X-ray luminosity is a steady solution. On the other hand,
slow wind solution with a large X-ray luminosity is not a realizable solution.
In bright X-ray binary systems, X-ray luminosity would increase until strong
X-ray reduces the line-driven acceleration and causes a stagnation of the wind.
This result implies an important consequence that the X-ray luminosity of the
wind-fed, X-ray emitting binary will be settled by the wind stagnation limit.
At the same time, the fast wind solution with small X-ray luminosity also can
be a steady state. Bright X-ray sources, such as Vela X-1, would have limiting
luminosities of wind stagnation, while faint systems such a quiescent Super
giant Fast X-ray Transients could be on the faint solutions.

shown recently [Phys. Rev. E 89, 010101(R) (2014)], the SSEP belongs to the
elliptic universality class. Here, for very large currents, the diffusion terms
of the MFT equations can be neglected compared with the terms coming from the
shot noise. Using the hodograph transformation and an additional change of

extreme-current problem for a flat deterministic initial density profile with
an arbitrary density 0<n<1. The solution yields the most probable density

consider an inflationary cosmology with a preceding nonsingular bounce which
gives rise to observable signatures on primordial perturbations. One
interesting phenomenon is that both the primordial scalar and tensor modes can

the stop mixing parameter $A_t$ can be larger and therefore, smaller stop mass
is sufficient for 125 GeV Higgs. When the mirage scale is around TeV scale, the

The surface of the TI is modulated by a perpendicular magnetic field and a
pulsed exchange field provided by an array of ferromagnetic insulating (FI)
stripes. The collective density and velocity oscillations in the
two-dimensional Dirac electron gas are simulated and analyzed. It is shown that
in spin plasmons, the collective electron density and momentum are modulated by
the spin state. Direct experimental observations of such oscillations are

sheet densities $0.5$-$30\times 10^{15}$ m$^{-2}$. The theoretical estimations
of $\mu_{ac}$ are in good agreement with the experiment without any adjustable

in relation to GaAs based heterostructures. The phonon-drag thermopower,
$S^{g}$, which according to Herring's expression is inversely proportional to
$\mu_{ac}$ is severely increased exceeding 200 mV/K at $T=5$ K depending on

mixed-valence-type correlations affecting the charge-transfer between the gold

magnesium ions on a gold surface which shows no evidence for a mixed-valence

type I and type II seesaw mechanisms. Type I seesaw contribution to neutrino
mass matrix is of tri-bimaximal (TBM) type which gives rise to vanishing
$\theta_{13}$ leaving the Dirac CP phase undetermined. If the Dirac neutrino
mass matrix is assumed to take the diagonal charged lepton type structure, such
a TBM type neutrino mass matrix originating from type I seesaw corresponds to
real values of Dirac Yukawa couplings in the terms $Y_{ij} \bar{L_i} H N_j$.
This makes the process of right handed heavy neutrino decay into a light
neutrino and Higgs $(N \rightarrow \nu H)$ CP preserving ruling out the
possibility of leptogenesis. Here we consider the type II seesaw term as the
common origin of non-zero $\theta_{13}$ and $\delta_{CP}$ by taking it as a
perturbation to the leading order TBM type neutrino mass matrix. First, we
numerically fit the type I seesaw term by taking oscillation as well as
cosmology data and then compute the predictions for neutrino parameters after
the type II seesaw term is introduced. We consider a minimal structure of the
type II seesaw term and check whether the predictions for neutrino parameters
lie in the $3\sigma$ range. We also compute the predictions for baryon
asymmetry of the Universe by considering type II seesaw term as the only source
of CP violation and compare it with the latest cosmology data.

properties of water molecules are investigated through classical molecular
dynamics simulations using two well known non-polarizable water models.
Simulations reveal that the presence of magnesium chloride (MgCl$_2$) induces
perturbations in the hydrogen bond network of water leading to the formation of
bulk-like domains with \textquoteleft defect sites\textquoteright~on boundaries
of such domains: water molecules at such defect sites have less number of
hydrogen bonds than those in bulk water. Reorientational autocorrelation
functions for dipole vectors of such defect water molecules are computed at
different concentrations of ions and compared with system of pure water.
Earlier experimental and simulation studies indicate significant differences in
reorientational dynamics for water molecules in the first hydration shell of
many dissolved ions. Results of this study suggest that defect water molecules,
which are beyond the first hydration shells of ions, also experience
significant slowing down of reorientation times as a function of concentration
in the case of MgCl$_2$. However, addition of cesium chloride(CsCl) to water
does not perturb the hydrogen bond network of water significantly even at
higher concentrations. This difference in behavior between MgCl$_2$ and CsCl is
consistent with the well-known Hofmeister series.

entropy current from the equilibrium partition function of the fluid system. In
this note, we have applied this algorithm for the charged fluid at second order
in derivative expansion. From the partition function we first constructed one
example of entropy current with non-negative divergence upto the required
order. Finally we extended it to its most general form, consistent with the
principle of local entropy production. As a by-product we got the constraints
on the second order transport coefficients for a parity even charged fluid, but
in some non-standard fluid frame.
