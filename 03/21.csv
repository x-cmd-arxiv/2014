diagram has been constructed. However, synaptic polarities in this diagram, and
thus, circuit functions are largely unknown. Here, we deciphered the likely
polarities of 7 pre-motor neurons implicated in the control of worm's
locomotion, using a combination of experimental and computational tools. We
performed single and multiple laser ablations in the locomotor interneuron
circuit and recorded times the worms spent in forward and backward locomotion.
We constructed a theoretical model of the locomotor circuit and searched its
all possible synaptic polarity combinations and sensory input patterns in order
to find the best match to the timing data. The optimal solution is when either
all or most of the interneurons are inhibitory and forward interneurons receive
the strongest input, which suggests that inhibition governs the dynamics of the
locomotor interneuron circuit. From the five pre-motor interneurons, only AVB
and AVD are equally likely to be excitatory, i.e. they have probably similar
number of inhibitory and excitatory connections to distant targets. The method
used here has a general character and thus can be also applied to other neural
systems consisting of small functional networks.

Has 11 figures",,,,"physics.atom-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The phase and amplitude (Ph-A) of a wave function vary slowly and
monotonically with distance, in contrast to the wave function that can be
highly oscillatory. Hence an attractive feature of the Ph-A representation is
that it requires far fewer meshpoints than for the wave function itself. In
1930 Milne developed an equation for the phase and the amplitude functions (W.
E. Milne, Phys. Rev. 35, 863 (1930)), and in 1962 Seaton andPeach (M. J. Seaton
and G. Peach, Proc. Phys. Soc. 79 1296 (1962)) developed an iterative method
for solving Milne's Ph-A equations. Since the zero'th order term of the
iteration is identical to the WKB approximation, there is a close relationship
between the Ph-A and the WKB representations of a wave function. The objective
of the present study is to show that a spectral Chebyshev expansion method to
solve Seaton and Peach's iteration scheme is feasible, and requires very few
meshpoints for the whole radial interval. Hence this method provides an
economical and accurate way to calculate wave functions out to large distances.
In a numerical example for which the potential decreased slowly with distance
as 1/r^3, the whole radial range of [0-2000] covered with 301 mesh points (and
Chbyshev basis functions). The first order iteration of the Ph-A wave function
was found to have an accuracy better than 1%, and was always more accurate than
the WKB wave function.

a space-based VLBI array working at sub-millimeter wavelengths and to gain
ultrahigh angular resolution. To achieve this ambitious goal, the mission plan
is divided into three stages. The first phase of the program is called Space
Millimeter-wavelength VLBI Array (SMVA) consisting of two satellites, each
carrying a 10-m diameter radio telescope into elliptical orbits with an apogee
height of 60000 km and a perigee height of 1200 km. The VLBI telescopes in
space will work at three frequency bands, 43, 22 and 8 GHz. The 43- and 22-GHz
bands will be equipped with cryogenic receivers. The space telescopes,
observing together with ground-based radio telescopes, enable the highest
angular resolution of 20 micro-arcsecond ($\mu$as) at 43 GHz. The SMVA is
expected to conduct a broad range of high-resolution observational research,
e.g. imaging the shadow (dark region) of the supermassive black hole in the
heart of the galaxy M87 for the first time, studying the kinematics of water
megamasers surrounding the SMBHs, and exploring the power source of active
galactic nuclei. Pre-research funding has been granted by the CAS in October
2012, to support scientific and technical feasibility studies. These studies
also include the manufacturing of a prototype of the deployable 10-m

that volatility and volume interact, particularly when the levels of both are
high. We find that the distribution of the volume-conditional volatility is
well fit by a power-law function with an exponential cutoff. We find that the
volume-conditional volatility distribution scales with volume, and collapses
these distributions to a single curve. We exploit the characteristics of the
volume-volatility scatter plot to find a strong correlation between logarithmic
volume and a quantity we define as local maximum volatility (LMV), which
indicates the largest volatility observed in a given range of trading volumes.
This finding supports our empirical analysis showing that volume is an
excellent predictor of the maximum value of volatility for both same-day and
near-future time periods. We also use a joint conditional probability that
includes both volatility and volume to demonstrate that invoking both allows us
to better predict the largest next-day volatility than invoking either one
alone.

equations are used in a wide variety of applications. For these systems, the
maximum a posteriori (MAP) state path can be defined as the curves around which
lie the infinitesimal tubes with greatest posterior probability, which can be
found by maximizing a merit function built upon the Onsager--Machlup
functional. A common approach used in the engineering literature to obtain the
MAP state path is to discretize the dynamics and obtain the MAP state path for
the discretized system. In this paper, we prove that if the trapezoidal scheme
is used for discretization, then the discretized MAP state path estimation
converges hypographically to the continuous-discrete MAP state path estimation
as the discretization gets finer. However, if the stochastic Euler scheme is
used instead, then the discretized estimation converges to the minimum energy
estimation. The minimum energy estimates are, in turn, proved to be the state
paths associated with the MAP noise paths, which in some cases differ from the
MAP state paths. Therefore, the discretized MAP state paths can have different
interpretations depending on the discretization scheme used.

reliable calibration, we must also specify its discrepancy: how, when
calibrated, it differs from reality. We propose a method for calibration that
combines a statistical emulator for the likelihood function with importance
sampling. The emulator provides an interim sample of inputs at which the
simulator is run, from which the likelihood is calculated. Importance sampling
is then used to re-weight the inputs and provide a final sample of calibrated

published in major press, there is not much scholar work so far. In this paper,
we provide some pioneer analysis on Tumblr from a variety of aspects. We study
the social network structure among Tumblr users, analyze its user generated
content, and describe reblogging patterns to analyze its user behavior. We aim
to provide a comprehensive statistical overview of Tumblr and compare it with
other popular social services, including blogosphere, Twitter and Facebook, in
answering a couple of key questions: What is Tumblr? How is Tumblr different
from other social media networks? In short, we find Tumblr has more rich
content than other microblogging platforms, and it contains hybrid
characteristics of social networking, traditional blogosphere, and social
media. This work serves as an early snapshot of Tumblr that later work can
leverage.

methodology that can update all the parameters as well as the number of
parameters simultaneously using simple deterministic transformations of some
low-dimensional (often one-dimensional) random variable. This methodology,
which has been inspired by the recent Transformation based MCMC (TMCMC) for
updating all the parameters simultaneously in general fixed-dimensional set-ups
using low-dimensional random variables, facilitates great speed in terms of
computation time and provides high acceptance rates, thanks to the
low-dimensional random variables which effectively reduce the dimension
dramatically. Quite importantly, our transformation based approach provides a
natural way to automate the move-types in the variable dimensional problems. We
refer to this methodology as Transdimensional Transformation based Markov Chain
Monte Carlo (TTMCMC).
  We develop the theory of TTMCMC, illustrating it with gamma and normal
mixtures with unknown number of components, for both simulated and real data
sets. Comparisons with RJMCMC demonstrates far superior performance of TTMCMC
in terms of mixing, acceptance rate, computational speed and automation.
Furthermore, we demonstrate good performance of TTMCMC in multivariate normal
mixtures, even for dimension as large as 20. To our knowledge, there exists no
application of RJMCMC for such high-dimensional mixtures.
  Further, we propose a novel methodology to summarize the posterior, providing
a way to obtain the mode of the posterior distribution of the densities and the
associated highest posterior density credible regions. Based on our method we
also propose a criterion to assess convergence of variable-dimensional
algorithms. These methods of summarization and convergence assessment are
applicable to general problems, not just to mixtures.

coexistent modes of operation, that can be described as: continuous wave (CW),
transform limited pulses (P1) and positive chirped pulses (P2). Optical rogue
waves, in the form of pulses of high energy appearing much often than expected
in a Gaussian distribution, are observed in the chaotic regime of the mode P2,
but not of P1. These high energy pulses appear in an unpredictable way, but it
is observed that their separation (if measured in number of round trips) can
take only some definite values, which received the name of ""magic numbers"". The
existence of optical rogue waves in P2 and not in P1, and also of the magic
numbers, are correctly reproduced by a numerical simulation based on a
five-variables iterative map. But, a successful numerical simulation provides
limited insight on the physical causes of the observed phenomena. We present
evidence that optical rogue waves in this laser follow a modulational
instability, and that an initial condition in P1 rapidly evolves into P2 if the
parameters' values are beyond that instability's threshold. The magic numbers
are residuals of the periodic orbits of the ""cold"" cavity when it is perturbed
by the opposite effects of a dissipative term, due to the presence of
transversal apertures, and an expansive term, due to the Kerr effect.

are using the radiation hydrodynamics code STELLA to describe the SN evolution
of both models over a time frame of about 500 days. We describe the
shock-breakout phases of both SNe which are characterized by a higher
luminosity, a longer duration and a lower effective temperature than those of
ordinary SNeIIP. We derive the bolometric as well as the U, B, V, R and I light
curves of our PISN models, which show a long-lasting plateau phase with maxima
at Mbol=-19.3 mag and -21.3 mag for our lower and higher mass model,
respectively. We also describe the photospheric composition and velocity as
function of time. We conclude that the light curve of the explosion of our
initially 150 Msun star resembles those of relatively bright SNeIIP, whereas
its photospheric velocity at early times is smaller. Its 56Ni mass of 0.04 Msun
also falls well into the range found in ordinary core collapse SNe. The light
curve and photospheric velocity of our 250 Msun models has a striking

greatly simplifies the estimation of the Hawkes branching ratio, recently
proposed as a proxy for market endogeneity and formerly estimated using
numerical likelihood maximisation. We employ our new method to support recent
theoretical and experimental results indicating that the best fitting Hawkes

  cosmological models and the effect of averaging","13 pages, 7 figures",,,,"astro-ph.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Since the advent of the accelerated expanding homogeneous universe model,
some other explanations for the supernova Ia dimming have been explored, among
which there are inhomogeneous models constructed with exact $\Lambda = 0$
solutions of Einstein's equations. They have been used either as one patch or
to build Swiss-cheese models. The most studied ones have been the
Lema\^itre-Tolman-Bondi (LTB) models. However, these models being spatially
spherical, they are not well designed to reproduce the large scale structures
which exhibit clusters, filaments and non spherical voids. This is the reason
why Szekeres models, which are devoid of any symmetry, have recently come into
play. In this paper, we give the equations and an algorithm to compute the
redshift-drift for the most general quasi-spherical Szekeres (QSS) models with
no dark energy. We apply it to a QSS model recently proposed by Bolejko and
Sussman (BSQSS model) who averaged their model to reproduce the density
distribution of the Alexander and collaborators' LTB model which is able to fit
a large set of cosmological data without dark energy. They concluded that their
model represents a significant improvement over the observed cosmic structure
description by spherical LTB models. We show here that this QSS model is ruled
out by a negative cosmological redshift, i.e. a blueshift, which is not
observed in the Universe. We also compute a positive redshift and the
redshift-drift for the Alexander et al.'s model and compare this redshift-drift
to that of the $\Lambda$CDM model. We conclude that the process of averaging an
unphysical QSS model can lead to obtain a physical model able to reproduce our
observed local Universe with no dark energy need and that the redshift-drift
can discriminate between this model and the $\Lambda$CDM model. For
completeness, we also compute the blueshift-drift of the BSQSS model.

polar-compensated interfaces. The asymmetry of general interface directions
poses known challenges for standard methods of calculation: a multiplicity of
interface distinctions, artificial electric fields, and indeterminacy of
orientation stability. By placing each distinct interface in a variety of
supercell environments, we demonstrate that the spread of both band offsets and
interface enthalpies is acceptably small for reasonable cell lengths, removing
the need for corrections involving inappropriate assumptions or computationally
expensive structures. Both the orientation and the ionic character of abrupt
(111) zinc blende interfaces are shown to affect band alignment and interface
enthalpy. We find that the band offsets for the compensated and abrupt (111)
and (100) interfaces lie on a strongly bimodal distribution of total width
greater than 1.2 eV, while the (110) band offset lies near the distribution
midpoint. The midpoint agrees with previous experiments on (100) interfaces,
but only one peak of the distribution agrees with (111) interface experiments,
indicating that the grown macroscopic (111) interfaces had significant
selectivity among the possible microscopic interfaces. The polar-compensated
interfaces are shown to be more stable than the corresponding abrupt interfaces
over most growth conditions.

excess in the temperature power spectrum which places a limit of
$r_{0.002}<0.11$ (95% CL) on such models. Single-field inflationary models that
reconcile these two observations, even those where the tilt runs substantially,
introduce a scale into the scalar power spectrum. To cancel the tensor excess,
and simultaneously explain the excess already present in $\Lambda$CDM, ideally
the model should introduce this scale as a relatively sharp transition in the
tensor-scalar ratio around the horizon at recombination. We consider models
which generate such a step in this quantity and find that they can improve the
joint fit to the temperature and polarization data by up to $2\Delta \ln{\cal

detailed analysis of a system of Riccati equations, for which we show existence

content of conscious awareness. However, such a contrast based on conscious
content alone would not only reveal brain activities directly contributing to
conscious perception, but also include brain activities that precede or follow
it. To address this issue, we devised a paradigm whereby we collected,
trial-by-trial, measures of objective performance, subjective awareness, and
the confidence level of subjective awareness. Using magnetoencephalography
recordings in healthy human volunteers, we dissociated brain activities
underlying these different cognitive phenomena. Our results provide strong
evidence that widely distributed slow cortical potentials (SCPs) correlate with
subjective awareness, even after the effects of objective performance and
confidence were both removed. The SCP correlate of conscious perception
manifests strongly in its waveform, phase, and power. In contrast, objective
performance and confidence were both contributed by relatively transient brain

about $10^{16}$ GeV, where primordial inflation could have started in a cold
metastable state. For each point of that band, the highness of the Higgs
potential at the false minimum is calculable, and there is an associated
prediction for the inflationary gravitational wave background, namely for the
tensor to scalar ratio $r$. We show that the recent measurement of $r$ by the
BICEP2 collaboration, $r=0.16 _{-0.05}^{+0.06}$ at $1\sigma$, combined with the
most up-to-date measurements of the top quark and Higgs boson masses, reveals
that the hypothesis that a Standard Model shallow false minimum was the source
of inflation in the early Universe is viable.

inflationary model building. We describe the standard formulation of starting
with an approximate shift symmetry for a scalar field, and then introducing
corrections systematically in order to maintain control over the inflationary
potential. We find that this leads to models in good agreement with recent
data. On the other hand, there are attempts in the literature to deviate from
this paradigm by invoking other symmetries and corrections. In particular: in a
suite of recent papers, several authors have made the claim that standard
Einstein gravity with a cosmological constant and a massless scalar carries
conformal symmetry. They further claim that such a theory carries another
hidden symmetry; a global SO(1,1) symmetry. By deforming around the global
SO(1,1) symmetry, they are able to produce a range of inflationary models with
asymptotically flat potentials, whose flatness is claimed to be protected by
these symmetries. These models tend to give rise to B-modes with small
amplitude. Here we explain that these authors are merely introducing a
redundancy into the description, not an actual conformal symmetry. Furthermore,
we explain that the only real (global) symmetry in these models is not at all
hidden, but is completely manifest when expressed in the Einstein frame; it is
in fact the shift symmetry of a scalar field. When analyzed systematically as
an effective field theory, deformations do not generally produce asymptotically
flat potentials and small B-modes, but other types of potentials with B-modes
of appreciable amplitude. Such simple models typically also produce the
observed red spectral index, Gaussian fluctuations, etc. In short: simple
models of inflation, organized by expanding around a shift symmetry, are in
excellent agreement with recent data.

demonstrate that some classes of SPTs (termed ""Type II"") trap fractional

symmetry-breaking domain walls; while some classes of SPTs (termed ""Type III"")
have degenerate zero energy modes (carrying the projective representation
protected by the unbroken part of the symmetry), either near the 0D kink of a
symmetry-breaking domain wall, or on a symmetry-preserving 1D system
dimensionally reduced from a thin 2D tube with a monodromy defect 1D line
embedded. More generally, the energy spectrum and conformal dimensions of
gapless edge modes under an external gauge flux insertion (or twisted by a
branch cut, i.e., a monodromy defect line) through the 1D ring can distinguish
many SPT classes. We provide a manifest correspondence from the physical
phenomena, the induced fractional quantum number and the zero energy mode
degeneracy, to the mathematical concept of cocycles that appears in the group
cohomology classification of SPTs, thus achieving a concrete physical
materialization of the cocycles. The aforementioned edge properties are
formulated in terms of a long wavelength continuum field theory involving
scalar chiral bosons, as well as in terms of Matrix Product Operators and

gravity is crucial for stellar classification, it is the mean stellar density
which is most useful when studying transiting exoplanets, due to its direct
impact on the transit light curve shape. Indeed, an accurate and independent
measure of the stellar density can be leveraged to infer subtle properties of a
transiting system, such as the companion's orbital eccentricity via
asterodensity profiling. We here calibrate flicker to the mean stellar density
of 439 Kepler targets with asteroseismology, allowing us to derive a new
empirical relation given by
$\log_{10}(\rho_{\star}\,[\mathrm{kg}\,\mathrm{m}^{-3}]) = 5.413 - 1.850
\log_{10}(F_8\,[\mathrm{ppm}])$. The calibration is valid for stars with
$4500$K$<T_{\mathrm{eff}}<6500$K, $K_P<14$ and flicker estimates corresponding
to stars with $3.25<\log g_{\star}<4.43$. Our relation has a model error in the
stellar density of 31.7% and so has $\sim8$ times lower precision than that
from asteroseismology but is applicable to a sample $\sim40$ times greater.
Flicker therefore provides an empirical method to enable asterodensity

large sample of galaxies obtained from a state-of-the-art cosmological
hydrodynamic simulation. This means that the temporal distribution of SF peaks
in galaxies as a population is fractal with a Hausdorff fractal dimension equal
to $\phi-1$. This finding reveals, for the first time, that the superficially
chaotic process of galaxy formation is underlined by a temporal
self-organization up to at least one gigayear. It is tempting to suggest that,
given the known existence of spatial fractals (such as the power-law two-point
function of galaxies), there is a joint spatio-temporal self-organization in
galaxy formation. From an observational perspective, it will be urgent to
devise diagnostics to probe SF histories of galaxies with good temporal
resolution to facilitate a test of this prediction. If confirmed, it would
provide unambiguous evidence for a new picture of galaxy formation that is
interaction driven, cooperative and coherent in and between time and space.
Unravelling its origin may hold the key to understanding galaxy formation.

molecular hydrogen depletion by dissociation of $H_2$ and $H^-$ from the

cooling haloes that have never formed stars in their past, have not been
polluted with heavy elements and are cooling predominantly via atomic hydrogen
lines. Amongst them we identified six haloes that could potentially harbour
massive seed black holes formed via direct collapse (with masses in the range
of $10^{4-6} M_{sun}$). These potential hosts of direct-collapse black holes
form as satellites and are found within 15 physical kpc of proto-galaxies, with
stellar masses in the range $10^{5-7} M_{sun}$ and maximal star formation rates
of 0.1 Msun/yr over the past 5 Myr, and are exposed to the highest flux of

proximity to these proto-galaxies that differentiates these haloes from rest of

has enough cross-sectional area to match observations of Fomalhaut b. However,
published numerical experiments of impacts between 100 km objects suggest this
outcome is unlikely. If collisional processes maintain a steep size
distribution over a broad range of particle sizes (300 microns to 10 km),
Earth-mass planets can capture enough material over 1-100 Myr to produce a
detectable cloud of dust. Otherwise, capture fails. When young planets are
surrounded by massive clouds or disks of satellites, a collisional cascade is
the simplest mechanism for dust production in Fomalhaut b. Several tests using

to this recent GIM2D photometric and stellar mass bulge + disk decompositions

with stellar mass, halo mass, and bulge mass, with a less steep dependence on
local galaxy density and bulge-to-total stellar mass ratio (B/T). At fixed
internal properties, we find that central and satellite galaxies have different
passive fraction relationships. For centrals, we conclude that there is less
variation in the passive fraction at a fixed bulge mass, than for any other

the quenching mechanism must be most tightly coupled to the bulge. We argue

polarization alone places stronger constraints on cosmological parameters than

than TT by up to a factor 2.8 when a multipole range of l=30-2500 is
considered. We expose the physical effects at play behind this remarkable
result and study how it depends on the multipole range included in the
analysis. In most relevant cases, TE or EE surpass the TT based cosmological
constraints. This result is important as the small scale astrophysical
foregrounds are expected to have a much reduced impact on polarization, thus
opening the possibility of building cleaner and more stringent constraints of
the LCDM model. This is relevant specially for proposed future CMB satellite
missions, such as CORE or PRISM, that are designed to be cosmic variance
limited in polarization till very large multipoles. We perform the same
analysis for a Planck-like experiment, and conclude that even in this case TE
alone should determine the constraint on $\Omega_ch^2$ better than TT by 15%,
while determining $\Omega_bh^2$, $n_s$ and $\theta$ with comparable accuracy.
Finally, we explore a few classical extensions of the LCDM model and show again
that CMB polarization alone provides more stringent constraints than CMB

accretion rate of gas during formation, thus the final bulk composition of
planets with primordial H/He is a function of it. Observationally, for
exoplanets with known mass and radius it is possible to estimate the bulk
composition via internal structure models. We first determine the reduction
factor of the ISM grain opacity f_opa that leads to gas accretion rates
consistent with grain evolution models. We then compare the bulk composition of
synthetic low-mass and giant planets at different f_opa with observations. For
f_opa=1 (full ISM opacity) the synthetic low-mass planets have too small radii,
i.e., too low envelope masses compared to observations. At f_opa=0.003, the
value calibrated with the grain evolution models, synthetic and actual planets
occupy similar mass-radius loci. The mean enrichment of giant planets relative
to the host star as a function of planet mass M can be approximated as
Z_p/Z_star = beta*(M/M_Jup)^alpha. We find alpha=-0.7 independent of f_opa in
synthetic populations in agreement with the observational result (-0.71+-0.10).
The absolute enrichment level decreases from beta=8.5 at f_opa=1 to 3.5 at
f_opa=0. At f_opa=0.003 one finds beta=7.2 which is similar to the
observational result (6.3+-1.0). We thus find observational hints that the
opacity in protoplanetary atmospheres is much smaller than in the ISM even if
the specific value of the grain opacity cannot be constrained here. The result
for the enrichment of giant planets helps to distinguish core accretion and
gravitational instability. In the simplest picture of core accretion where
first a critical core forms and afterwards only gas is added, alpha=-1. If a
core accretes all planetesimals inside the feeding zone, alpha=-2/3. The
observational result lies between these values, pointing to core accretion as
the formation mechanism.

edge of the N relic corresponds to a shock of Mach number 4.6+/-1.1, under the
assumptions of diffusive shock acceleration of thermal particles in the test
particle regime. Here, we present results from new Chandra observations of the
cluster. The Chandra surface brightness profile across the N relic only hints
to a surface brightness discontinuity (<2-sigma detection). Nevertheless, our
reanalysis of archival Suzaku data indicates a temperature discontinuity across
the relic that is consistent with a Mach number of 2.5+/-0.5, in agreement with
previously published results. This confirms that the Mach number at the shock
traced by the N relic is much weaker than predicted from the radio. Puzzlingly,
in the Chandra data we also identify additional inner small density
discontinuities both on and off the merger axis. Temperature measurements on
both sides of the discontinuities do not allow us to undoubtedly determine
their nature, although a shock front interpretation seems more likely. We
speculate that if the inner density discontinuities are indeed shock fronts,
then they are the consequence of violent relaxation of the dark matter cores of
the clusters involved in the merger.

a new picture emerging is that intrinsic alignment of galaxies would be a
balance between slow large-scale coherent torquing and fast spin reorientation

feeding galaxies with gas and stars along filaments or sheets, introduce
coherence for spin directions of galaxies along the respective structures.

Universe. The large angular scale CMB polarization experiment BICEP2 has
announced a major discovery, which can be explained as the gravitational wave
signature of inflation, at a level that matches predictions by natural
inflation models. The natural inflation (NI) potential is theoretically
exceptionally well motivated in that it is naturally flat due to shift
symmetries, and in the simplest version takes the form $V(\phi) = \Lambda^4 [1
\pm \cos(N\phi/f)]$. A tensor-to-scalar ratio $r>0.1 $ as seen by BICEP2
requires the height of any inflationary potential to be comparable to the scale
of grand unification and the width to be comparable to the Planck scale. The
Cosine Natural Inflation model agrees with all cosmic microwave background
measurements as long as $f \geq m_{\rm Pl}$ (where $m_{\rm Pl} = 1.22 \times
10^{19}\ {\rm GeV}$) and $\Lambda \sim m_{\rm GUT} \sim 10^{16}\ {\rm GeV}$.
This paper also discusses other variants of the natural inflation paradigm: we
show that axion monodromy with potential $V\propto \phi^{2/3}$ is inconsistent
with the BICEP2 limits at the 95\% confidence level, and low-scale inflation is
strongly ruled out. Linear potentials $V \propto \phi$ are inconsistent with
the BICEP2 limit at the 95\% confidence level, but are marginally consistent
with a joint Planck/BICEP2 limit at 95\%. We discuss the pseudo-Nambu Goldstone
model proposed by Kinney and Mahanthappa as a concrete realization of low-scale
inflation. While the low-scale limit of the model is inconsistent with the
data, the large-field limit of the model is marginally consistent with BICEP2.
All of the models considered predict negligible running of the scalar spectral
index, and would be ruled out by a detection of running.

mutually dual objects, like finite-dimensional Hopf algebras and their duals,
or quantisations of function algebras and of universal enveloping algebras of
Poisson-Lie groups. The same phenomenon was studied for quantum groupoids in
various settings. In the purely algebraic setup, the construction of a dual
object was given by Schauenburg and by Kadison and Szlach\'anyi, but required
the quantum groupoid to be finite with respect to the base. A sophisticated
duality for measured quantum groupoids was developed by Enock, Lesieur and
Vallin in the setting of von Neumann algebras.
  We propose a purely algebraic duality theory without any finiteness
assumptions, generalising Van Daele's duality theory of multiplier Hopf
algebras and borrowing ideas from the theory of measured quantum groupoids. Our
approach is based on the multiplier Hopf algebroids recently introduced by Van
Daele and the author, and on a new approach to integration on algebraic quantum
groupoids. The main concept are left and right integrals on regular multiplier
Hopf algebroids that are adapted to quasi-invariant weights on the basis. Given
such integrals, we show that they are unique up to rescaling, admit modular
automorphisms, and that left and right ones are related by modular elements.
Then, we construct, without any finiteness or Frobenius assumption, a dual
multiplier Hopf algebroid with integrals and prove biduality.

similar states of time variability. We apply this method to the Galactic
supermassive black hole, where 2.2 um flux is observed from a source associated
with SgrA*, and where two distinct states have recently been suggested. Our
approach is taken from mathematical finance and works with conditional flux
density distributions that depend on the previous flux value. The discrete,

transition probabilities are inferred from the flux density time series. Using
the most comprehensive data set to date, in which all Keck and a majority of

sufficiently described by a single intrinsic state. However the observed flux
densities exhibit two states: a noise-dominated and a source-dominated one. Our

sensitive to the non-Newtonian effects and may be used to constrain gravity
theories if measured accurately. Small value of the free eccentricity of the
inner binary $e_{i}^{free}\approx 2.6\times 10^{-5}$ and vanishing forced
eccentricity of the outer, relatively eccentric binary naturally result in
their apsidal near-alignment. In addition, this triple system provides a unique
opportunity to explore excitation of both eccentricity and inclination in
neutron star-WD binaries, e.g. due to random torques caused by convective
eddies in the WD progenitor. We show this process to be highly anisotropic and
more effective at driving eccentricity rather than inclination. The outer
binary eccentricity as well as $e_{i}^{free}$ exceed by more than an order of
magnitude the predictions of the eccentricity-period relation of Phinney
(1992), which is not uncommon. We also argue that the non-zero mutual

provide the first detection of the thermal emission from the symmetric, hot
dust envelope surrounding G0.120-0.048. Dust and gas composing the Pistol
nebula are primarily heated and ionized by the nearby Quintuplet Cluster stars.
The northern region of the Pistol nebula is decelerated due to the interaction
with the high-velocity (2000 km/s) winds from adjacent Wolf-Rayet Carbon (WC)
stars. With the DustEM code we determine that the Pistol nebula is composed of
a distribution of very small, transiently-heated grains (10-~35 {\AA}) and that
it exhibits a gradient of decreasing grain size from the south to the north due
to differential sputtering by the winds from the WC stars. Dust in the
G0.120-0.048 nebula is primarily heated by the central star; however, the
nebular gas is ionized externally by the Arches Cluster. Unlike the Pistol
nebula, the G0.120-0.048 nebula is freely expanding into the surrounding
medium. Given independent dust and gas mass estimates we find that the Pistol
and G0.120-0.048 nebulae exhibit similar gas-to-dust mass ratios of ~310 and
~290, respectively. Both nebulae share identical size scales (~ 0.7 pc) which
suggests that they have similar dynamical timescales of ~10^5 yrs, assuming a
shell expansion velocity of v_exp 60 km/s.

individuals posting and storing data about themselves and friends using online

(quantified-self movement). Across the sciences, researchers conduct studies
collecting data with an unprecedented resolution and scale. Using computational
power combined with mathematical models, such rich datasets can be mined to
infer underlying patterns, thereby providing insights into human nature. Much
of the data collected is sensitive. It is private in the sense that most
individuals would feel uncomfortable sharing their collected personal data
publicly. For this reason, the need for solutions to ensure the privacy of the
individuals generating data has grown alongside the data collection efforts.
Out of all the massive data collection efforts, this paper focuses on efforts
directly instrumenting human behavior, and notes that -- in many cases -- the
privacy of participants is not sufficiently addressed. For example, study
purposes are often not explicit, informed consent is ill-defined, and security
and sharing protocols are only partially disclosed. This paper provides a
survey of the work related to addressing privacy issues in research studies
that collect detailed sensor data on human behavior. Reflections on the key
problems and recommendations for future work are included. We hope the overview
of the privacy-related practices in massive data collection studies can be used
as a frame of reference for practitioners in the field. Although focused on

neutron star matter through gravitational waves emitted during the postmerger
phase of a binary neutron star system. The method relies on a small number of
detections of the peak frequency in the postmerger phase for binaries of
different (relatively low) masses, in the most likely range of expected
detections. From such observations, one can construct the derivative of the
peak frequency versus the binary mass, in this mass range. Through a detailed
study of binary neutron star mergers for a large sample of equations of state,
we show that one can extrapolate the above information to the highest possible
mass (the threshold mass for black hole formation in a binary neutron star
merger). In turn, this allows for an empirical determination of the maximum
mass of cold, nonrotating neutron stars to within 0.1 M_sun, while the
corresponding radius is determined to within a few percent. Combining this with
the determination of the radius of cold, nonrotating neutron stars of 1.6 M_sun
(to within a few percent, as was demonstrated in Bauswein et al., PRD, 86,
063001, 2012), allows for a clear distinction of a particular candidate
equation of state among a large set of other candidates. Our method is
particularly appealing because it reveals simultaneously the moderate and very
high-density parts of the equation of state, enabling the distinction of
mass-radius relations even if they are similar at typical neutron star masses.
Furthermore, our method also allows to deduce the maximum central energy
density and maximum central rest-mass density of cold, nonrotating neutron
stars with an accuracy of a few per cent.

Time dependent simulations showed that the maximum radiation power is larger
for flatter transverse distributions due to enhanced optical guiding in the
tapered section of the undulator. For a transversely Gaussian beam the maximum
output power was found to be $\text{P}_{max}$=$1.56$ TW compared to $2.26$ TW
for the parabolic case and $2.63$ TW for the uniform case. Spectral data also
showed a 30-70$\%$ reduction in energy deposited in the sidebands for the
uniform and parabolic beams compared with a Gaussian. An analysis of the
maximum power as a function of detuning from resonance shows that redshifting
the central wavelength by $\Delta \lambda / \lambda <\rho$ increases the power
for all three transverse electron distributions.

intermediate mass black holes (IMBH) in data collected by LIGO and Virgo
between 2005 and 2010. The search was sensitive to astrophysical sources that
produced damped sinusoid gravitational wave signals, also known as ringdowns,
with frequency $50\le f_{0}/\mathrm{Hz} \le 2000$ and decay timescale
$0.0001\lesssim \tau/\mathrm{s} \lesssim 0.1$ characteristic of those produced
in mergers of IMBH pairs. No significant gravitational wave candidate was
detected. We report upper limits on the astrophysical coalescence rates of
IMBHs with total binary mass $50 \le M/\mathrm{M}_\odot \le 450$ and component
mass ratios of either 1:1 or 4:1. For systems with total mass $100 \le
M/\mathrm{M}_\odot \le 150$, we report a 90%-confidence upper limit on the rate
of binary IMBH mergers with non-spinning and equal mass components of
$6.9\times10^{-8}\,$Mpc$^{-3}$yr$^{-1}$. We also report a rate upper limit for
ringdown waveforms from perturbed IMBHs, radiating 1% of their mass as
gravitational waves in the fundamental, $\ell=m=2$, oscillation mode, that is
nearly three orders of magnitude more stringent than previous results.

differential number counts for ATLAS components exhibit monotonic declines in
both total intensity and linear polarization from millijansky levels down to
the survey limit of ~100 uJy. We discuss the parameter space in which component
counts may suitably proxy source counts. We do not detect any components or
sources with fractional polarization levels greater than 24%. The ATLAS data
are consistent with a lognormal distribution of fractional polarization with
median level 4% that is independent of flux density down to total intensity ~10
mJy and perhaps even 1 mJy. Each of these findings are in contrast to previous
studies; we attribute these new results to improved data analysis procedures.
We find that polarized emission from 1.4 GHz millijansky sources originates
from the jets or lobes of extended sources that are powered by an active
galactic nucleus, consistent with previous findings in the literature. We
provide estimates for the sky density of linearly polarized components and
sources in 1.4 GHz surveys with ~10"" resolution.

candidates to improve the performance of graphene transistors that is usually
hindered by the gapless nature of graphene. Although the energy bandgap of
strained graphene still remains zero, the shift of Dirac points in the
\textbf{\emph{k}}-space due to strain-induced deformation of graphene lattice
can lead to the appearance of a finite conduction gap of several hundreds meV
in strained junctions with a strain of only a few percent. However, since it
depends essentially on the magnitude of Dirac point shift, this conduction gap
strongly depends on the direction of applied strain and the transport
direction. In this work, a systematic study of conduction gap properties with
respect to these quantities is presented and the results are carefully
analyzed. Our study provides useful information for further investigations to
exploit graphene strained junctions in electronic applications.

exchange theory in metal particles and it dependence of on particle size and
electron temperature. We obtained the expressions for the constants of the
electron-lattice energy exchange using the quantum-kinetic approach for
infinite metal, and compared it with the result of classical kinetic approach.
Both methods give the same result. But for the metal particles smaller than the
mean free path of electrons, as we show, a quantum-kinetic approach (in its
standard form) can not be applied, while the classical approach can be easily
generalized to the particle of such sizes. We found a new peculiarity of the
electron-lattice energy exchange - its temperature dependence around certain
size - ""magic size"" of metal nanoparticles. Our calculation shown, that this
changes of the electron-lattice energy exchange are associated with alteration
of acoustic subzones which takes part in energy transfer. The change of the
electron temperature can also lead to changes (around the ""magic size"") in the
acoustic subzones, which are involved in energy transfer. As a result, constant
of the electron-phonon interaction in nanoparticles can be either much higher
or much lower than the corresponding constant for infinite metal.

ideas of ``deterministic annealing"" - a powerful non-convex optimization
framework derived from information theoretic principles with analogies to
statistical physics. The key idea is to randomize the mappings and control the
Shannon entropy of the system during optimization. The entropy constraint is
gradually relaxed in a deterministic annealing process while tracking the
minimum, to obtain the ultimate deterministic mappings. Deterministic annealing
has been successfully employed in several problems including clustering, vector
quantization, regression, as well as the Witsenhausen's counterexample in our
recent work[1]. We extend our method to a more involved setting, a variation of
Witsenhausen's counterexample, where there is a side channel between the two
controllers. The problem can be viewed as a two stage cancellation problem. We
demonstrate that there exist complex strategies that can exploit the side
channel efficiently, obtaining significant gains over the best affine and known
non-linear strategies.

the structure of the source at high energies. At these energies, current

quadratically constrained problem (MIQCP) is still to construct strong but
computationally cheap convex relaxations, especially when dense quadratic
functions are present. We propose a cutting surface procedure based on multiple
diagonal perturbations to derive strong convex quadratic relaxations for
nonconvex quadratic problem with separable constraints. Our resulting
relaxation does not use significantly more variables than the original problem,
in contrast to many other relaxations based on lifting. The corresponding
separation problem is a highly structured semidefinite program (SDP) with
convex but non-smooth objective. We propose to solve this separation problem
with a specialized primal-barrier coordinate minimization algorithm.
Computational results show that our approach is very promising. First, our
separation algorithm is at least an order of magnitude faster than interior
point methods for SDPs on problems up to a few hundred variables. Secondly, on
nonconvex quadratic integer problems, our cutting surface procedure provides
lower bounds of almost the same strength with the diagonal SDP bounds used by
(Buchheim and Wiegele, 2013) in their branch-and-bound code Q-MIST, while our
procedure is at least an order of magnitude faster on problems with dimension
greater than 70. Finally, combined with (linear) projected RLT cutting planes
proposed by (Saxena, Bonami and Lee, 2011), our procedure provides slightly
weaker bounds than their projected SDP+RLT cutting surface procedure, but in
several order of magnitude shorter time. Finally we discuss various avenues to
extend our work to design more efficient branch-and-bound algorithms for
MIQCPs.

been proposed as a model of hair initiation in the epidermal cells of plant
roots. Specifically the model captures the kinetics of a small G-protein ROP,
which can occur in active and inactive forms, and whose activation is believed
to be mediated by a gradient of the plant hormone auxin. Here the model is made
more realistic with the inclusion of a transverse co-ordinate. Localised
stripe-like solutions of active ROP occur for high enough total auxin
concentration and lie on a complex bifurcation diagram of single and
multi-pulse solutions. Transverse stability computations, confirmed by
numerical simulation show that, apart from a boundary stripe, these 1D
solutions typically undergo a transverse instability into spots. The spots so
formed typically drift and undergo secondary instabilities such as spot
replication. A novel 2D numerical continuation analysis is performed that shows
the various stable hybrid spot-like states can coexist. The parameter values
studied lead to a natural singularly perturbed, so-called semi-strong
interaction regime. This scaling enables an analytical explanation of the
initial instability, by describing the dispersion relation of a certain
non-local eigenvalue problem. The analytical results are found to agree
favourably with the numerics. Possible biological implications of the results

stars with spectral types G or later the mean FUV-NUV color becomes much bluer,
contrary to expectation. we have found in two samples of mid-F through K type
stars that ~14-18% of them exhibit FUV-excesses relative to their NUV fluxes
and spectral types. Nearly the same fractions are also discovered among members
of the Kepler Eclipsing Binary Catalog and in the published list of Kepler
Objects of Interest. These UV-excess (""UVe"") colors are confirmed by the UV
continuum slopes in GALEX spectra. The SDSS spectra of some UVe stars exhibit
metallic line weakening especially in the blue. This suggests an enhanced
contribution of UV flux relative to photospheric flux of a solar-type single
star. We consider the possibility that the UV excesses originate from various
types of hot stars, including binaries, and strong chromosphere stars that. Our
model atmosphere-derived simulations of colors for binaries with main sequence
pairs with a hot secondary demonstrate that the color loci conflict with the
observed sequence. We are left with the active chromospheres explanation,
whether in active binaries or young stars, as a still tentative explanation for
the UVe stars. We also address the presence of an island of ""UV red"" stars in
the NUV-g, g-i color diagram. The subpopulation comprising this island are
mainly horizontal branch stars. These objects do not exhibit UV excesses and
therefore have UV colors typical for their spectral types. This subpopulation

by the kinetic phase evolution equation using the scalar order parameter,

structure and function for quantum behavior at biological length scales.
Orthodox type II endonucleases, the largest class of restriction enzymes,
recognize four-to-eight base pair sequences of palindromic DNA, cut both
strands symmetrically, and act without an external metabolite such as ATP.
While it is known that these enzymes induce strand breaks by attacking
phosphodiester bonds, what remains unclear is the mechanism by which cutting
occurs in concert at the catalytic centers. Previous studies indicate the
primacy of intimate DNA contacts made by the specifically bound enzyme in
coordinating the two synchronized cuts. We propose that collective electronic
behavior in the DNA helix generates coherent oscillations, quantized through
boundary conditions imposed by the endonuclease, that provide the energy
required to break two phosphodiester bonds. Such quanta may be preserved in the
presence of thermal noise and electromagnetic interference through decoherence
shielding, the specific complex's exclusion of water and ions surrounding the
helix. Clamping energy imparted by the enzyme decoherence shield is comparable
with zero-point modes of the dipole-dipole oscillations in the DNA recognition
sequence. The palindromic mirror symmetry of this sequence should conserve
parity during the process. Experimental data corroborate that symmetric
bond-breaking ceases when the symmetry of the endonuclease complex is violated,
or when environmental parameters are perturbed far from biological optima.
Persistent correlation between states in DNA sequence across spatial
separations of any length--a characteristic signature of quantum
entanglement--may be explained by such a physical mechanism.

that the change in spin evolution was likely coincident with a bright X-ray

discontinuity in the frequency. We find that the source 3-10 keV flux has
declined monotonically by a factor of ~2 over an 80-day period post-outburst
accompanied by a ~20% decrease in the source's blackbody temperature, although
there is evidence for both flux and kT having levelled off. We argue that the

methods are valid only for one-dimensional (1-D) localization of the ID
sources. By contrast, in the proposed approach the signal subspace is
constructed for estimating the nominal azimuth and elevation
direction-of-arrivals and the angular spreads. The proposed estimator enjoys
closed-form expressions and hence it bypasses the searching over the entire
feasible field. Therefore, it imposes significantly lower computational
complexity than the conventional 2-D estimation approaches. Our analysis shows
that the estimation performance of the proposed approach improves when the
large-scale/massive MIMO systems are employed. The approximate Cram\'{e}r-Rao

Numerical results demonstrate that albeit the proposed estimation method is
comparable with the traditional 2-D estimators in terms of performance, it
benefits from a remarkably lower computational complexity.

the beam dump, the beam power will be converted to thermal load and brought
away by the cooling water. Two measures are taken to deal with the huge power
density at the target. One is to enlarge the contact area between the beam and
the target, and this is to be accomplished by expanding the beam profile at the
target and using two copper plates each having a 20o inclination angle relative
to the beam direction. The other is to produce more homogenous beam profile at
the target to minimize the maximum power density. Here the beam dump line is
designed to meet the requirement of beam expansion and homogenization, and the
step-like field magnets are employed for the beam spot homogenization. The
simulations results including space charge effects and errors show that the
beam line can meet the requirements very well at the three different energies
(3.2 MeV, 5 MeV and 10 MeV). In the meantime, the alternative beam design using
standard multipole magnets is also presented.

6% Sr2+ substituted sample with x=0.550. Sound velocity measurements reveal a
phase transition at Tc~279K. The temperature dependence of FWHM of (h00)pc
peaks and the unit cell volume also show anomalies around 279K even though
there is no indication of any change of space group in the synchrotron X-ray
powder diffraction (SXRD) patterns. The neutron powder diffraction patterns
reveal appearance of superlattice peaks below Tc~279K confirming the existence
of an antiferrodistortive phase transition. The Rietveld analysis of the room
temperature and low temperature SXRD data below Tc shows that the structure
corresponds to single monoclinic phase in the Cm space group while the analysis
of neutron powder diffraction data reveals that the structure of the ground
state phase below Tc corresponds to the Cc space group. Our analysis shows that
the structural models for the ground state phase based on R3c space group with
or without the coexistence of the room temperature monoclinic phase in the Cm

systems and they fully characterize the analytic properties of the free energy
and hence thermodynamics of the systems. Determining the Lee-Yang zeros is not
only fundamentally important for conceptual completeness of thermodynamics and
statistical physics but also technically useful for studying many-body systems.
However, Lee-Yang zeros have never been observed in experiments, due to the
intrinsic difficulty that Lee-Yang zeros would occur only at complex values of

Lee-Yang zeros, by measuring quantum coherence of a probe spin coupled to an
Ising-type spin bath. As recently proposed, the quantum evolution of the probe
spin introduces a complex phase factor, and therefore effectively realizes an
imaginary magnetic field on the bath. From the measured Lee-Yang zeros, we
reconstructed the free energy of the spin bath and determined its phase
transition temperature. This experiment demonstrates quantum coherence probe as
a useful approach to studying thermodynamics in the complex plane, which may
reveal a broad range of new phenomena that would otherwise be inaccessible if
physical parameters are restricted to be real numbers.

affirmatively to that question. We present a new methodology, NUROA, to
numerically approximate the Canny's roadmap, which is a network of
one-dimensional algebraic curves. Our algorithm encloses the roadmap with a
chain of tiny boxes each of which contains a piece of the roadmap and whose
connectivity captures the roadmap connectivity. It starts by enclosing the
entire space with a box. In each iteration, remaining boxes are shrunk on all
sides and then split into smaller sized boxes. Those boxes that are empty are
detected in the shrink phase and removed. The algorithm terminates when all
remaining boxes are smaller than a resolution that can be either given as input
or automatically computed using root separation lower bounds. Shrink operation
is cast as a polynomial optimization with semialgebraic constraints, which is
in turn transformed into a (series of) semidefinite programs (SDP) using the
Lasserre's approach. NUROA's success is due to fast SDP solvers. NUROA
correctly captured the connectivity of multiple curves/skeletons whereas
competitors such as IBEX and Realpaver failed in some cases. Since boxes are
independent from one another, NUROA can be parallelized particularly on GPUs.
NUROA is available as an open source package at http://nuroa.sourceforge.net/.

stochastic differential equations (BSDEs) in a Markovian framework. The schemes
belonging to the class under consideration benefit from a certain stability
property. As a consequence, the overall rate of the convergence of these
schemes is controlled by their local truncation error. The schemes are
categorized by the number of intermediate stages implemented between
consecutive partition time instances. We show that the order of the schemes
matches the number $p$ of intermediate stages for $p\le3$. Moreover, we show
that the so-called order barrier occurs at $p=3$, that is, that it is not
possible to construct schemes of order $p$ with $p$ stages, when $p>3$. The
analysis is done under sufficient regularity on the final condition and on the
coefficients of the BSDE.

network which accounts for the scaling of the entanglement entropy in a system
at a finite temperature. In this construction, the ordinary entanglement
renormalization flow given by the class of tensor networks known as the Multi
Scale Entanglement Renormalization Ansatz (MERA), is supplemented by an
additional entanglement structure at the length scale fixed by the temperature.
The network comprises two copies of a MERA circuit with a fixed number of
layers and a pure matrix product state which joins both copies by entangling
the infrared degrees of freedom of both MERA networks. The entanglement
distribution within this bridge state defines reduced density operators on both
sides which cause analogous effects to the presence of a black hole horizon
when computing the entanglement entropy at finite temperature in the AdS/CFT
correspondence. The entanglement and correlations during the thermalization
process of a system after a quantum quench are also analyzed. To this end, a
full tensor network representation of the action of local unitary operations on
the bridge state is proposed. This amounts to a tensor network which grows in
size by adding succesive layers of bridge states. Finally, we discuss on the
holographic interpretation of the tensor network through a notion of distance
within the network which emerges from its entanglement distribution.

methods for image recovery problems. In this paper, we extend the NLTV-based
regularization to multicomponent images by taking advantage of the Structure
Tensor (ST) resulting from the gradient of a multicomponent image. The proposed
approach allows us to penalize the non-local variations, jointly for the
different components, through various $\ell_{1,p}$ matrix norms with $p \ge 1$.
To facilitate the choice of the hyper-parameters, we adopt a constrained convex
optimization approach in which we minimize the data fidelity term subject to a
constraint involving the ST-NLTV regularization. The resulting convex
optimization problem is solved with a novel epigraphical projection method.
This formulation can be efficiently implemented thanks to the flexibility
offered by recent primal-dual proximal algorithms. Experiments are carried out
for multispectral and hyperspectral images. The results demonstrate the
interest of introducing a non-local structure tensor regularization and show
that the proposed approach leads to significant improvements in terms of
convergence speed over current state-of-the-art methods.

Thorotrast presents a very long latency period between the injection and the
development of the related pathologies. It is an example of the more general
problem posed by a radioactive internal contaminant whose effects are not
noteworthy in the short term but become dramatic in the long period. A point
that is still to be explored is fluctuations (in space and time) in the
localized absorption of radiation by the tissues. Methods: A Monte Carlo
simulation code has been developed to study over a 30 year period the daily
absorption of alpha radiation by micrometer sized portions of tissue placed at
a distance of 0-100 micrometers from a model source, that approximates a
compact thorium dioxide source in liver or spleen whose size is larger or equal
to 20 micrometers. The biological depletion of the daughter nuclei of the
thorium series is taken into account. The initial condition assumes chemically
purified natural thorium. Results: Most of the absorbed dose is concentrated in
a 25 micrometer thick layer of tissue, adjacent to the source boundary.
Fluctuations where a target region with a volume of 1 cube micrometer is hit by
3-5 alpha particles in a day or in a shorter period of time are relevant in a
1-10 micrometer thick layer of tissue adjacent to the source boundary, where
their frequency is larger than the Poisson law prediction.

increase in the speed and sensitivity of protein identification and
characterization, even from complex samples. Indeed, what was a challenge
twenty years ago is now little more than a daily routine. Although not
completely over, the technological challenge now makes room to another
challenge, which is the best possible appraisal and exploitation of proteomic
data to draw the best possible conclusions from a biological point of view. The
point developed in this paper is that proteomic data are almost always
fragmentary. This means in turn that although better than an mRNA level, a
protein level is often insufficient to draw a valid conclusion from a
biological point of view, especially in a world where PTMs play such an
important role. This means in turn that transformation of proteomic data into
biological data requires an important intermediate layer of functional
validation, i.e. not merely the confirmation of protein abundance changes by

solutions to a class of physically relevant, strongly coupled parabolic systems

is that the diffusion matrix may be generally neither symmetric nor positive

variables, determined by the entropy density, which is defined by the
gradient-flow formulation. The transformation yields at the same time a
positive semi-definite diffusion matrix, suitable gradient estimates as well as
lower and/or upper bounds of the solutions. These bounds are a consequence of
the transformation of variables and are obtained without the use of a maximum

be solved by this technique. The systems are formally derived from
continuous-time random walks on a lattice modeling, for instance, the motion of

consider the deviation of the matter spectrum from $\Lambda$-CDM on nonlinear
scales where a halo model is utilized. We find that the discrepancy peaks

interest to humanity since thousands of years. Clearly, such a rich question
can not be answered in a single manner, and a plethora of approaches naturally
do exist. However, during the last two decades, a new standpoint, of
thermostatistical nature, has emerged. It is related to the proposal of
nonadditive entropies in 1988, in order to generalise the celebrated
Boltzmann-Gibbs additive functional, basis of standard statistical mechanics.
Such entropies have found deep fundamental interest and uncountable
applications in natural, artificial and social systems. In some sense, this
perspective represents an epistemological paradigm shift. These entropies
crucially concern complex systems, in particular those whose microscopic
dynamics violate ergodicity. Among those, living matter and other living-like
systems play a central role. We briefly review here this approach, and present
some of its predictions, verifications and applications.

on which of the qubits they occur. Furthermore, we apply combinations of the
entire set of logical single-qubit Clifford gates on the encoded qubit to
explore its computational capabilities. The implemented 7-qubit code is the
first realization of a complete Calderbank-Shor-Steane (CSS) code and
constitutes a central building block for FTQC schemes based on concatenated
elementary quantum codes. It also represents the smallest fully functional

(linear ranking or tournament). We denote by $\ell$ the length of the
chromosomes, by $m$ the population size, by $p_C$ the crossover probability and
by $p_M$ the mutation probability. We introduce a parameter $\sigma$, called
the selection drift, which measures the selection intensity of the fittest
chromosome. We show that the dynamics of the genetic algorithm depend in a
critical way on the parameter $$\pi \,=\,\sigma(1-p_C)(1-p_M)^\ell\,.$$ If
$\pi<1$, then the genetic algorithm operates in a disordered regime: an
advantageous mutant disappears with probability larger than $1-1/m^\beta$,
where $\beta$ is a positive exponent. If $\pi>1$, then the genetic algorithm
operates in a quasispecies regime: an advantageous mutant invades a positive
fraction of the population with probability larger than a constant $p^*$ (which
does not depend on $m$). We estimate next the probability of the occurrence of
a catastrophe (the whole population falls below a fitness level which was
previously reached by a positive fraction of the population). The asymptotic
results suggest the following rules: $\pi=\sigma(1-p_C)(1-p_M)^\ell$ should be
slightly larger than $1$; $p_M$ should be of order $1/\ell$; $m$ should be
larger than $\ell\ln\ell$; the running time should be of exponential order in
$m$. The first condition requires that $ \ell p_M +p_C< \ln\sigma$. These
conclusions must be taken with great care: they come from an asymptotic regime,
and it is a formidable task to understand the relevance of this regime for a
real-world problem. At least, we hope that these conclusions provide
interesting guidelines for the practical implementation of the simple genetic
algorithm.

spectrum is only asymptotically nondispersive (as contrasted with the pure AdS
case), putting a small standing wave solution on the top of AdS solution indeed
prevents the turbulent instability. Thus we support the idea advocated in
previous works that nondispersive character of the spectrum of linear
perturbations of AdS space is crucial for the conjectured turbulent
instability.

two-dimensional spatial dissipative solitons in models based on the complex
Ginzburg-Landau equations with the cubic-quintic combination of loss and gain
terms, which include imaginary, real, or complex spatially periodic potentials.
The imaginary potential represents periodic modulation of the local loss and
gain. It is shown that the effective gradient force, induced by the
inhomogeneous loss distribution, gives rise to three generic propagation
scenarios for one-dimensional (1D) dissipative solitons: transverse drift,
persistent swing motion, and damped oscillations. When the lattice-average
loss/gain value is zero, and the real potential has spatial parity opposite to
that of the imaginary component, the respective complex potential is a
realization of the parity-time symmetry. Under the action of lattice potentials
of the latter type, 1D solitons feature unique motion regimes in the form of
transverse drift and persistent swing. In the 2D geometry, three types of
axisymmetric radial lattices are considered, viz., ones based solely on the
refractive-index modulation, or solely on the linear-loss modulation, or on a
combination of both. The rotary motion of solitons in such axisymmetric
potentials can be effectively controlled by varying the strength of the initial
tangential kick.

metric, outside the body, admits an expansion in terms of Damour-Iyer moments.
A Poincare transformation then yields the corresponding metric tensor in the
global system in post-Minkowskian approximation.
  (ii) It will be argued why the global metric, exact to post-Minkowskian
order, can be obtained by means of an instantaneous Poincare transformation for

rotation. We discuss models with zero rotation velocity and with velocities of
40% of the break-up velocity on the zero-age main-sequence. These values are
expected to bracket realistic rotation velocity distributions in stellar
populations. The new rotating models for massive stars are more luminous and
hotter due to a larger convective core and enhanced surface abundances. This
results in pronounced changes in the integrated spectral energy distribution of
a population containing massive stars. The changes are most significant at the
shortest wavelengths where an increase of the ionizing luminosity by up to a
factor of 5 is predicted. We also show that high equivalent widths of
recombination lines may not necessarily indicate a very young age but can be
achieved at ages as late as 10 Myr. Comparison of these two boundary cases (0
and 40% of the break-up velocity) will allow users to evaluate the effects of
rotation and provide guidance for calibrating the stellar evolution models. We
also introduce a new theoretical ultraviolet spectral library built from the
Potsdam Wolf-Rayet (PoWR) atmospheres. Its purpose is to help identify
signatures of Wolf-Rayet stars in the ultraviolet whose strength is sensitive
to the particulars of the evolution models. The new models are available for

occupied $e_g$ orbitals ($e_g$ orbital model) we demonstrate that the orbital
excitations change qualitatively with increasing transverse field, and that the
excitation gap closes at the quantum phase transition to a polarized state.
This phase transition disappears in the quantum compass model with maximally
frustrated orbital interactions which resembles the Kitaev model. Here we find
that finite transverse field destabilizes the orbital-liquid ground state with
macroscopic degeneracy, and leads to peculiar behavior of the specific heat and
orbital susceptibility at finite temperature. We show that the entropy and the
cooling rate at finite temperature exhibit quite different behavior near the

century, this condition has played a relevant role in the theory of partial
differential equations, as a shape assumption aimed to ensure the existence of
a solution for the classical Dirichlet problem on $S$. In a completely
different setting, this paper is devoted to analyze some statistical
applications of the Poincar\'{e} cone property (when defined in a slightly
stronger version). First, we show that this condition can be seen as a sort of
generalized convexity: while it is considerably less restrictive than
convexity, it still retains some ``convex flavour.'' In particular, when
imposed to a probability support $S$, this property allows the estimation of
$S$ from a random sample of points, using the ``hull principle'' much in the
same way as a convex support is estimated using the convex hull of the sample
points. The statistical properties of such hull estimator (consistency,
convergence rates, boundary estimation) are considered in detail. Second, it is
shown that the class of sets fulfilling the Poincar\'{e} property is a
$P$-Glivenko-Cantelli class for any absolutely continuous distribution $P$ on
$\mathbb{R}^d$. This has some independent interest in the theory of empirical
processes, since it extends the classical analogous result, established for
convex sets, to a much larger class. Third, an algorithm to approximate the
cone-convex hull of a finite sample of points is proposed and some practical
illustrations are given.

Vlasov equation and QSS are mapped into stable stationary solutions of such

attracted considerable attention, the Hamiltonian Mean Field (HMF) model. For
such a model, stationary inhomogeneous and homogeneous states determine an
integrable dynamics in the mean-field effective potential and an action-angle
transformation allows one to derive an exact linear response formula. However,
such a result would be of limited interest if restricted to the integrable
case. In this paper, we show how to derive a general linear response formula
which does not use integrability as a requirement. The presence of conservation
laws (mass, energy, momentum, etc.) and of further Casimir invariants can be
imposed a-posteriori. We perform an analysis of the infinite time asymptotics
of the response formula for a specific observable, the magnetization in the HMF

stationary stable distributions: the Boltzmann-Gibbs equilibrium distribution

oscillations (kHz QPOs), observed at frequencies matching orbital frequencies

regions. In this paper, we follow the lower kHz QPOs, in response to Type I
X-ray bursts, in two prototypical QPO sources, namely 4U 1636-536 and 4U
1608-522, as observed by the Proportional Counter Array of the Rossi X-ray
Timing Explorer. We have selected a sample of 15 bursts for which the kHz QPO
frequency can be tracked on timescales commensurable with the burst durations
(tens of seconds). We find evidence that the QPOs are affected for over ~200 s
during one exceptionally long burst and ~100 s during two others (although at a
less significant level), while the burst emission has already decayed to a
level that would enable the pre-burst QPO to be detected. On the other hand,
for most of our burst-kHz QPO sample, we show that the QPO is detected as soon
as the statistics allow and in the best cases, we are able to set an upper
limit of ~20 s on the recovery time of the QPO. This diversity of behavior
cannot be related to differences in burst peak luminosity. We discuss these
results in the framework of recent findings that accretion onto the neutron
star may be enhanced during Type I X-ray bursts. The subsequent disk depletion
could explain the disappearance of the QPO for ~100 s, as possibly observed in
two events. However, alternative scenarios would have to be invoked for
explaining the short recovery timescales inferred from most bursts. Clearly the
combination of fast timing and spectral information of Type I X-ray bursts
holds great potential in the study of the dynamics of the inner accretion flow

momentum by spontaneous parametric down conversion (SPDC) using a Bessel-Gauss
pump beam. The angular and conditional angular spectra are calculated for an
uniaxial crystal optimized for type I SPDC with standard Gaussian pump beams.
It is shown that, as the mean value of the magnitude of the transverse wave
vector of the pump beam increases, the emission cone is deformed into two non
coaxial cones that touch each other along a line determined by the orientation
of the optical axis of the nonlinear crystal. At this location, the conditional
spectrum becomes maximal for a pair of photons, one of which is best described
by a Gaussian-like photon with a very small transverse wave vector, and the
othera Bessel-Gauss photon with a distribution of transverse wave vectors
similar in amplitude to that of the incident pump beam. A detailed analysis is
then performed of the angular momentum content of SPDC photons by the
evaluation of the corresponding transition amplitudes. As a result, we obtain
conditions for the generation of heralded single photons which are
approximately propagation invariant and have orbital angular momentum. A
discussion is given about the difficulties in the interpretation of the results

normal to the crystal surface. The angular spectra and the conditional angular

caches to cope with the ever-increasing traffic demand of users. Content,
however, is essentially versatile: once published at a given time, its
popularity vanishes over time. All requests for a given document are then
concentrated between the publishing time and an effective perishing time.
  In this paper, we propose a new model for the arrival of content requests,
which takes into account the dynamical nature of the content catalog. Based on
two large traffic traces collected on the Orange network, we use the
semi-experimental method and determine invariants of the content request
process. This allows us to define a simple mathematical model for content
requests; by extending the so-called ""Che approximation"", we then compute the
performance of a LRU cache fed with such a request process, expressed by its
hit ratio. We numerically validate the good accuracy of our model by comparison
to trace-based simulation.

meson-meson bremsstrahlung $m+m\to m+m+\gamma$, meson-baryon bremsstrahlung
$m+B\to m+B+\gamma$), the decays of $\phi$ and $a_1$ mesons and the photons
produced in the initial hard collisions ('pQCD'). Our calculations suggest that
the channel decomposition of the observed spectrum changes with centrality with
an increasing (dominant) contribution of hadronic sources for more peripheral
reactions. Furthermore, the 'thermal' photon yield is found to scale roughly
with the number of participant nucleons as $N_{part}^\alpha$ with $\alpha
\approx$ 1.5, whereas the partonic contribution scales with an exponent
$\alpha_p \approx1.75$. Additionally, we provide predictions for the centrality
dependence of the direct photon elliptic flow $v_2(p_T)$. The direct photon
$v_2$ is seen to be larger in peripheral collisions compared to the most
central ones since the photons from the hot deconfined matter in the early
stages of the collision carry a much smaller elliptic flow than those from the
final hadronic interactions.

one associated with a no-scale-type SU(2,1) / SU(2) x U(1)_R x Z_n Kahler
manifold and one more generic. In both cases, imposing a lower bound on the
parameter cR involved in the coupling between the inflaton and the Ricci scalar

can be attained even for subplanckian values of the inflaton while the
corresponding effective theory respects the perturbative unitarity. In the case
of no-scale SUGRA we show that, for every n, the inflationary observables
remain unchanged and in agreement with the current data while the inflaton mass
is predicted to be 3x10^13 GeV. Beyond no-scale SUGRA the inflationary
observables depend mildly on n and crucially on the coefficient involved in the
fourth order term of the Kahler potential which mixes the inflaton with the
accompanying non-inflaton field.

missing data in a dataset by using optimization algorithms to optimize the
network parameters after which prediction and classification tasks can be
performed. The optimization methods that are considered are genetic algorithm
(GA), simulated annealing (SA), particle swarm optimization (PSO), random
forest (RF) and negative selection (NS) and these methods are individually used
in combination with auto-associative neural networks (AANN) for missing data
estimation and the results obtained are compared. The methods suggested use the
optimization algorithms to minimize an error function derived from training the
auto-associative neural network during which the interrelationships between the
inputs and the outputs are obtained and stored in the weights connecting the
different layers of the network. The error function is expressed as the square
of the difference between the actual observations and predicted values from an
auto-associative neural network. In the event of missing data, all the values
of the actual observations are not known hence, the error function is
decomposed to depend on the known and unknown variable values. Multi-layer
perceptron (MLP) neural network is employed to train the neural networks using
the scaled conjugate gradient (SCG) method. Prediction accuracy is determined
by mean squared error (MSE), root mean squared error (RMSE), mean absolute
error (MAE), and correlation coefficient (r) computations. Accuracy in
classification is obtained by plotting ROC curves and calculating the areas
under these. Analysis of results depicts that the approach using RF with AANN
produces the most accurate predictions and classifications while on the other
end of the scale is the approach which entails using NS with AANN.

spectrum and modifies the corresponding order parameter distribution. These
effects result in effective, so-called critical Casimir forces (CCFs) acting on
the confining surfaces. These forces are attractive for like boundary
conditions of the order parameter at the opposing surfaces of the confinement.
For colloidal particles dissolved in a binary liquid mixture acting as a
solvent close to its critical point of demixing, one thus expects the emergence
of phase segregation into equilibrium colloidal liquid and gas phases. We
analyze how such phenomena occur asymmetrically in the whole thermodynamic
neighborhood of the consolute point of the binary solvent. By applying
field-theoretical methods within mean-field approximation and the
semi-empirical de Gennes-Fisher functional, we study the CCFs acting between
planar parallel walls as well as between two spherical colloids and their
dependence on temperature and on the composition of the near-critical binary
mixture. We find that for compositions slightly poor in the molecules
preferentially adsorbed at the surfaces, the CCFs are significantly stronger
than at the critical composition, thus leading to pronounced colloidal
segregation. The segregation phase diagram of the colloid solution following
from the calculated effective pair potential between the colloids agrees
surprisingly well with experiments and simulations.

boundary theory. Here, we analyze this expectation by computing the correlation
functions of the curvature perturbation $\zeta$ holographically. For this
purpose, we use a deformed conformal field theory at the boundary, with a
single deformation operator. In standard single field models of inflation,
$\zeta$ is known to be conserved at large scales under very general conditions.
However, we find that this is not generically the case in the dual description.
The requirement that higher correlators of $\zeta$ should be conserved severely
restricts the possibilities for the RG flow. With such restriction, the power
spectrum $P_\zeta$ must follow an exact power law, at least within the regime

cosmic voids, identified via the watershed technique in $\Lambda$CDM N-body
simulations. This function is universal across void size and redshift,
accurately describing a large radial range of scales around void centers with
only two free parameters. In analogy to halo density profiles, these parameters
describe the scale radius and the central density of voids. While we initially
start with a more general four-parameter model, we find two of its parameters
to be redundant, as they follow linear trends with the scale radius in two
distinct regimes of the void sample, separated by its compensation scale.
Assuming linear theory, we derive an analytic formula for the velocity profile
of voids and find an excellent agreement with the numerical data as well. In
our companion paper [Sutter et al., Mon. Not. R. Astron. Soc. 442, 462 (2014)]
the presented density profile is shown to be universal even across tracer type,
properly describing voids defined in halo and galaxy distributions of varying
sparsity, allowing us to relate various void populations by simple rescalings.
This provides a powerful framework to match theory and simulations with

partial analysis, we propose a few recommendations towards the improvement of
science education in Texas Schools, in general, and greater Houston area
schools in particular. Our results indicate that the quality of science
education can be improved significantly if we focus on the improvement of high
school education or even intermediate schools when students are first time
exposed to science in a little technical way. Simply organizing teacher
training programs at K-12 level as school education plays a pivotal role in the
decrease in physics enrollment at the higher level. Similar analysis can
actually be generalized to other states to find out the best way to increase
the physics enrollment.

optimization problems in which a decision-maker must balance between
exploration and exploitation while learning from partial feedback. Each action
is sampled in a manner that minimizes the ratio between squared expected
single-period regret and a measure of information gain: the mutual information
between the optimal action and the next observation. We establish an expected
regret bound for information-directed sampling that applies across a very
general class of models and scales with the entropy of the optimal action
distribution. We illustrate through simple analytic examples how
information-directed sampling accounts for kinds of information that
alternative approaches do not adequately address and that this can lead to
dramatic performance gains. For the widely studied Bernoulli, Gaussian, and
linear bandit problems, we demonstrate state-of-the-art simulation performance.

techniques that can be used. The variety of file systems encountered show what
an active area of research file system development is. The file systems may be
from one of the two fundamental categories. In one category, the file system is
developed in user space and runs as a user process. Another file system may be
developed in the kernel space and runs as a privileged process. Another one is
the mixed approach in which we can take the advantages of both aforesaid
approaches. Each development option has its own pros and cons. In this article,

Parsing is one of the very crucial tool in language analysis system which aims
to forecast the structural relationship among the words in a given sentence.
Many researchers have already developed so many language tools but the accuracy
is not meet out the human expectation level, thus the research is still exists.
Machine translation is one of the major application area under Natural Language
Processing. While translation between one language to another language, the
structure identification of a sentence play a key role. This paper introduces
the hybrid way to solve the identification of relationship among the given
words in a sentence. In existing system is implemented using rule based
approach, which is not suited in huge amount of data. The machine learning
approaches is suitable for handle larger amount of data and also to get better
accuracy via learning and training the system. The proposed approach takes a
Tamil sentence as an input and produce the result of a dependency relation as a
tree like structure using hybrid approach. This proposed tool is very helpful
for researchers and act as an odd-on improve the quality of existing
approaches.

are well suited to adopt phase shift keying techniques to embed the watermark.
In the proposed schemes, the phases of DFT and SCHT coefficients are modified
to convey watermark information using binary phase shift keying in cover video.
Low amplitude block selection (LABS) is used to improve transparency, amplitude
boost to improve the resistance of watermark from signal processing and
compression attacks and spread spectrum technique is used for encrypting

emerge as collective phenomena, without postulating them directly at the
