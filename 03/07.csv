interactions between third nearest neighbors. One model has hard core
exclusions between the nearest neighbor (1NN) particles (3NN1 model) and the
other - between 1NN and next-nearest-neighbor particles (3NN12 model).
Finite-size scaling analysis reveals that in these models, as in the 1NN AFM BC
model, the transition from paramagnetic to long-range order (LRO) AFM phase is
either of the first-order or goes through intermediate phase which might be
attributed to Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) type. We show that
properties of the low-temperature phase transition to the AFM phase of 1NN,
3NN1 and 3NN12 models are very similar in all interval of a normalized
single-ion anisotropy parameter, $\delta$, except where the first order phase
transitions occur. Due to different entropy of the 3NN12 and 3NN1 models, their
higher temperature behavior is different from that of the 1NN model. Three
phase transitions are observed for 3NN12 model: (i) from paramagnetic phase to
the phase with domains of the LRO AFM phase at $T_c$ ; (ii) from this structure
to diluted frustrated BKT-type phase at $T_2$ (high-temperature limit of the
critical line of the BKT-type phase transitions) and (iii) from this frustrated
phase to the AFM LRO phase at $T_1$ (low-temperature limit of this line). For

We show that the angle-energy distribution of Dirac muon neutrinos is sensitive
to the interference terms between the standard V-A coupling of left-chirality
muon neutrino and exotic V+A coupling of right-chirality one, which are
proportional to the transverse components of muon neutrino spin polarization.
The interferences do not vanish in a massless limit and include the relative
phases to test the CP violation (CPV). It allows to calculate a neutrino flux
for an assumed configuration of detector in the case of SM prediction, and the
upper limits on the neutrino flux for the left-right muon neutrino mixture. We
also demonstrate that the effects of neutrino mass and mixing are tiny
corrections and can be omitted. The most important conclusion is that even in
the massless limit, there are physical effects connected with the mixture of
left- and right-handed helicity components in a spin 1/2 quantum state, when
exotic interaction V+A is admitted contrary to the electron observables, where

investigated the fraction of clumpy galaxies and its evolution as a function of
stellar mass, star formation rate (SFR), and specific SFR (SSFR). The fraction
of clumpy galaxies in star-forming galaxies with Mstar > 10^9.5 Msun decreases
with time from ~0.35 at 0.8<z<1.0 to ~0.05 at 0.2<z<0.4 irrespective of the
stellar mass, although the fraction tends to be slightly lower for massive
galaxies with Mstar > 10^10.5 Msun at each redshift. On the other hand, the
fraction of clumpy galaxies increases with increasing both SFR and SSFR in all
the redshift ranges we investigated. In particular, we found that the SSFR
dependences of the fractions are similar among galaxies with different stellar
masses, and the fraction at a given SSFR does not depend on the stellar mass in
each redshift bin. The evolution of the fraction of clumpy galaxies from z~0.9
to z~0.3 seems to be explained by such SSFR dependence of the fraction and the
evolution of SSFRs of star-forming galaxies. The fraction at a given SSFR also
appears to decrease with time, but this can be due to the effect of the
morphological K-correction. We suggest that these results are understood by the
gravitational fragmentation model for the formation of giant clumps in disk
galaxies, where the gas mass fraction is a crucial parameter.

frequently have spreads and/or maturities that are not available on the current
market of CDSs, and are thus illiquid. This article introduces an
incomplete-market approach to valuing illiquid CDSs that, in contrast to the
risk-neutral approach of current market practice, allows a dealer who buys an
illiquid CDS from an investor to determine ask and bid prices (which differ) in
such a way as to guarantee a minimum positive expected rate of return on the
deal. An alternative procedure, which replaces the expected rate of return by
an analogue of the Sharpe ratio, is also discussed. The approach to pricing
just described belongs to the good-deal category of approaches, since the
dealer decides what it would take to make an appropriate expected rate of
return, and sets the bid and ask prices accordingly. A number of different
hedges are discussed and compared within the general framework developed in the
article. The approach is implemented numerically, and example plots of
important quantities are given. The paper also develops a useful result in
linear programming theory in the case that the cost vector is random.

interaction with nuclear spins is the main problem. One particular, neradicable
source of electron decoherence arises from decoherence of the nuclear spin
bath, driven by nuclear-nuclear dipolar interactions. Due to its many-body
nature nuclear decoherence is difficult to predict, especially for an important
class of strained nanostructures where nuclear quadrupolar effects have a
significant but largely unknown impact. Here we report direct measurement of
nuclear spin bath coherence in individual strained InGaAs/GaAs quantum dots:
nuclear spin-echo coherence times in the range T2~1.2 - 4.5 ms are found. Based
on these T2 values we demonstrate that quadrupolar interactions make nuclear
fluctuations in strained quantum dots much slower compared to lattice matched
GaAs/AlGaAs structures. Such fluctuation suppression is particularly strong for
arsenic nuclei due to the effect of atomic disorder of gallium and indium
alloying. Our findings demonstrate that quadrupolar effects can help to solve
the long-standing challenge of designing a scalable hardware for quantum

  LaTex",,,,"math-ph math.MP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this work, we derive the time-dependent Hartree(-Fock) equations as an
effective dynamics for fermionic many-particle systems. Our main results are
the first for a quantum mechanical mean-field dynamics for fermions; in
previous works, the mean-field limit is usually either coupled to a
semiclassical limit, or the interaction is scaled down so much, that the system
behaves freely for large particle number $N$. We consider the fermionic Hartree
equations (i.e., the Hartree-Fock equations without exchange term) in this
work, since the exchange term is subleading in our setting. The main result is
that the fermionic Hartree dynamics approximates the Schr\""odinger dynamics
well for large $N$. We give explicit values for the rates of convergence. We
prove two types of results. The first type is very general and concerns
arbitrary free Hamiltonians (e.g., relativistic, non-relativistic, with
external fields) and arbitrary interactions. The theorems give explicit
conditions on the solutions to the fermonic Hartree equations under which a
derivation of the mean-field dynamics succeeds. The second type of results
scrutinizes situations where the conditions are fulfilled. These results are
about non-relativistic free Hamiltonians with external fields, systems with
total kinetic energy bounded by $const \cdot N$ and with long-range
interactions of the form $|x|^{-s}$, with $0 < s < \frac{6}{5}$ (sometimes, for
technical reasons, with a weaker or cut off singularity). We prove our main
results by using a new method for deriving mean-field dynamics developed by
Pickl in [Lett. Math. Phys., 97(2):151-164, 2011]. This method has been applied
successfully in quantum mechanics for deriving the bosonic Hartree and
Gross-Pitaevskii equations. Its application to fermions in this work is new.
Finally, we show how also the recently treated semiclassical mean-field limits
can be derived with this method.

growing island early in its development, which maintains a coherent form as it
grows, in fact the island is seeded and its rotation frequency determined, by
nonlinear interaction. This process provides an initial structure that is of
the order of an ion gyro-radius wide, allowing the island to rapidly reach a
large size. A large degree of stochastisation around the seperatrix, and a
complete breakdown of the X-point is seen, which significantly reduces the
effective island width. A turbulent modification of the electrostatic field in
and around the island greatly affects the size of the resonant layer width, and
the island is seen to grow at the linear rate even though the island is
significantly wider than the singular layer width.

(AI), especially in the design of computerized opponents. Because of the
computational complexity involved in managing all aspects of these games, many
AI opponents are designed to optimize only a few areas of playing style. In
games like StarCraft 2, a very popular and recently released RTS, most AI
strategies revolve around economic and building efficiency: AI opponents try to
gather and spend all resources as quickly and effectively as possible while
ensuring that no units are idle. The aim of this work was to help address the
need for AI combat strategies that are not computationally intensive. Our goal
was to produce a computationally efficient model that is accurate at predicting
the results of complex battles between diverse armies, including which army
will win and how many units will remain. Our results suggest it may be possible
to develop a relatively simple approximation model of combat that can
accurately predict many battles that do not involve micromanagement. Future

binary indicator sequences and apply RFT on the indicator sequences to convert
them into frequency domain. The Euclidean distance of the complete RFT
coefficients of DNA sequences are used as similarity measure. To address the
different lengths in Euclidean space of RFT coefficients, we pad zeros to short
DNA binary sequences so that the binary sequences equal the longest length in
the comparison sequence data. Thus, the DNA sequences are compared in the same
dimensional frequency space without information loss. We demonstrate the
usefulness of the proposed method by presenting experimental results on
hierarchical clustering of genes and genomes. The proposed method opens a new

Microwave Background (CMB) temperature and polarisation fields, that probe
mixed bispectrum involving these fields, can help to determine the reionization
history of the Universe, beyond what can be achieved from cross-spectrum
analysis. Taking clues from recent studies for the detection of primordial
non-Gaussianity (Munshi & Heavens 2010), we develop a set of estimators that
can study reionization using a power spectrum associated with the bispectrum
(or skew-spectrum). We use the matched filtering inherent in this method to
investigate different reionization histories. We check to what extent they can
be used to rule out various models of reionization and study cross
contamination from different sources such as the lensing of the CMB. The
estimators can be fine-tuned to optimize study of a specific reionization
history. We consider three different types of tracers in our study, namely:
proto-galaxies; 21cm maps of neutral hydrogen; quasars. We also consider four
alternative models of reionization. We find that the cumulative signal-to-noise
(S/N) for detection at $\ell_{max}=2000$ can reach $\mathcal{O}(70)$ for cosmic
variance limited all-sky experiments. Combining 100GHz, 143GHz and 217GHz
channels of the Planck experiment, we find that the (S/N) lies in the range
$\mathcal{O}(5)-\mathcal{O}(35)$. The (S/N) depends on the specific choice of a
tracer field, and multiple tracers can be effectively used to map out the
entire reionization history with reasonable S/N. Contamination from weak
lensing is investigated and found to be negligible, and the effects of Thomson
scattering from patchy reionizationare also considered.

precise measurement of the neutrino mixing parameter theta_{23}. Using an
off-axis neutrino beam with a peak energy of 0.6 GeV and a data set
corresponding to 6.57 x 10^{20} protons on target, T2K has fit the
energy-dependent nu_mu oscillation probability to determine oscillation
parameters. Marginalizing over the values of other oscillation parameters
yields sin^2 (theta_{23}) = 0.514 +0.055/-0.056 (0.511 +- 0.055), assuming
normal (inverted) mass hierarchy. The best-fit mass-squared splitting for
normal hierarchy is Delta m^2_{32} = (2.51 +- 0.10) x 10^{-3} eV^2/c^4
(inverted hierarchy: Delta m^2_{13} = (2.48 +- 0.10) x 10^{-3} eV^2/c^4).
Adding a model of multinucleon interactions that affect neutrino energy
reconstruction is found to produce only small biases in neutrino oscillation

magnetic nanoparticles (SDMNPs) by alternating magnetic fields (AMFs) may offer
a useful tool for biomedical applications. The possibility of magnetothermal
multiplexing has not yet been realized, in part due to prevalent use of linear
response theory to model SDMNP heating in AMFs. Predictive successes of dynamic
hysteresis (DH), a more generalized model for heat dissipation by SDMNPs, are
observed experimentally with detailed calorimetry measurements performed at
varied AMF amplitudes and frequencies. The DH model suggests that specific
driving conditions play an underappreciated role in determining optimal
material selection strategies for high heat dissipation. Motivated by this
observation, magnetothermal multiplexing is theoretically predicted and
empirically demonstrated for the first time by selecting SDMNPs with properties
that suggest optimal hysteretic heat dissipation at dissimilar AMF driving
conditions. This form of multiplexing could effectively create multiple
channels for minimally invasive biological signaling applications.

open problem presented at ITA 2006) states that the DoF of a 2 user broadcast
channel, where the transmitter is equipped with 2 antennas and each user is
equipped with 1 antenna, must collapse under finite precision CSIT. In this
work we prove that the conjecture is true in all non-degenerate settings (e.g.,
where the probability density function of unknown channel coefficients exists
and is bounded). The DoF collapse even when perfect channel knowledge for one
user is available to the transmitter. This also settles a related recent
conjecture by Tandon et al. The key to our proof is a bound on the number of
codewords that can cast the same image (within noise distortion) at the
undesired receiver whose channel is subject to finite precision CSIT, while
remaining resolvable at the desired receiver whose channel is precisely known
by the transmitter. We are also able to generalize the result along two
directions. First, if the peak of the probability density function is allowed
to scale as O(P^(\alpha/2)), representing the concentration of probability
density (improving CSIT) due to, e.g., quantized feedback at rate
(\alpha/2)\log(P), then the DoF are bounded above by 1+\alpha, which is also
achievable under quantized feedback. Second, we generalize the result to the K
user broadcast channel with K antennas at the transmitter and a single antenna
at each receiver. Here also the DoF collapse under non-degenerate channel
uncertainty. The result directly implies a collapse of DoF to unity under
non-degenerate channel uncertainty for the general K-user interference and MxN
user X networks as well.

be qualitatively different. Such systems are therefore naturally described in
terms of multiplex or multi-layer networks, i.e. networks where each layer
stands for a different type of interaction between the same set of nodes. There
is today a growing interest in understanding when and why a description in
terms of a multiplex network is necessary and more informative than a
single-layer projection. Here, we contribute to this debate by presenting a
comprehensive study of correlations in multiplex networks. Correlations in node
properties, especially degree-degree correlations, have been thoroughly studied
in single-layer networks. Here we extend this idea to investigate and
characterize correlations between the different layers of a multiplex network.
Such correlations are intrinsically multiplex, and we first study them
empirically by constructing and analyzing several multiplex networks from the
real-world. In particular, we introduce various measures to characterize
correlations in the activity of the nodes and in their degree at the different
layers, and between activities and degrees. We show that real-world networks
exhibit indeed non-trivial multiplex correlations. For instance, we find cases
where two layers of the same multiplex network are positively correlated in
terms of node degrees, while other two layers are negatively correlated. We
then focus on constructing synthetic multiplex networks, proposing a series of
models to reproduce the correlations observed empirically and/or to assess
their relevance.

which economic preconditions is therefore a pressing and controversial issue of
vast political importance. In this work we employ an agent-based model to study
the economic and financial ramifications of three highly relevant crisis
resolution mechanisms. To establish the validity of the model we show that it
reproduces a series of key stylized facts if the financial and real economy.
The distressed institution can either be closed via a purchase & assumption
transaction, it can be bailed-out using taxpayer money, or it may be bailed-in
in a debt-to-equity conversion. We find that for an economy characterized by
low unemployment and high productivity the optimal crisis resolution with
respect to financial stability and economic productivity is to close the
distressed institution. For economies in recession with high unemployment the
bail-in tool provides the most efficient crisis resolution mechanism. Under no
circumstances do taxpayer-funded bail-out schemes outperform bail-ins with

simple DNA sequence measure, called Gmin, which is designed to identify genomic
regions experiencing introgression in a secondary contact model. Gmin is
defined as the ratio of the minimum between-population number of nucleotide
differences to the average number of between-population differences. One
advantage of Gmin is that it is computationally inexpensive relative to
model-based methods for detecting gene flow and it scales easily to the level
of whole-genome analysis. We compare the sensitivity and specificity of Gmin to
those of the widely used index of population differentiation, Fst, and suggest
a simple statistical test for identifying genomic outliers. Extensive computer
simulations demonstrate that Gmin has both greater sensitivity and specificity
for detecting recent introgression than does Fst. Furthermore, we find that the
sensitivity of Gmin is robust with respect to both the population mutation and
recombination rates. Finally, a scan of Gmin across the X chromosome of
Drosophila melanogaster identifies candidate regions of introgression between
sub-Saharan African and cosmopolitan populations that were previously missed by
other methods. These results show that Gmin is a biologically straightforward,
yet powerful, alternative to Fst, as well as to more computationally intensive
model-based methods for detecting gene flow.

point singularity within the topological surface state alone in the TCI
Pb$_{0.7}$Sn$_{0.3}$Se. Moreover, we show that the measured momentum-integrated
density of states exhibits pronounced peaks at the saddle point energies,
demonstrating the van Hove singularities (VHSs) in the topological surface
states, whose surface chemical potential, as we show, can be tuned via surface
chemical gating, providing access to the topological correlated physics on the
surface. Our experimental data reveal a delicate relationship among lattice
constant, band gap and spin-orbit coupling strength associated with the
topological phase transition in Pb$_{1-x}$Sn$_{x}$Se. Furthermore, we explore
the robustness of the TCI phase with VHS in Pb$_{1-x}$Sn$_{x}$Se, which shows a
variety of distinct topological phase transitions driven by either thermal
instability or broken crystalline symmetry, and thus revealing a rich
topological phase diagram connectivity in Pb$_{1-x}$Sn$_{x}$Se for the first
time.

quantitatively analyze the conversion of twist into writhe in the course of the

cylindrically symmetric Gold-Hoyle flux rope model and measure the writhe using
the formulae by Berger and Prior which express the quantity as a single

not simply scale with the initial flux rope twist, but depends mainly on the
growth rates of the instability eigenmodes of higher longitudinal order than
the basic mode. The saturation levels of the writhe, as well as the shapes of
the kinked flux ropes, are very similar for considerable ranges of initial flux
rope twists, which essentially precludes estimations of pre-eruptive twist from
measurements of writhe. However, our simulations suggest an upper twist limit

velocity precision achievable with the next generation of astronomical

both high stability of the observed line profiles and high signal to noise.
Many of these spectrographs plan to use highly coherent emission line
calibration sources like laser frequency combs and Fabry-Perot etalons to
achieve precision sufficient to detect terrestrial mass planets. These high
precision calibration sources often use single mode fibers or highly coherent
sources. Coupling light from single mode fibers to multi-mode fibers leads to
only a very low number of modes being excited, thereby exacerbating the modal
noise measured by the spectrograph. We present a commercial off-the-shelf

solution uses an integrating sphere in conjunction with a diffuser that is
moved rapidly using electrostrictive polymers, and is generally superior to
most tested forms of mechanical fiber agitation. We demonstrate a high level of

rate (SFR) of a galaxy of fixed stellar mass is determined by its dark matter
halo formation history, and as such, that more quiescent galaxies reside in
older halos. This simple model has been remarkably successful at predicting
color-based galaxy statistics at low redshift as measured in the Sloan Digital
Sky Survey (SDSS). To further test this method with observations, we present
new SDSS measurements of the galaxy two-point correlation function and
galaxy-galaxy lensing as a function of stellar mass and SFR, separated into
quenched and star-forming galaxy samples. We find that our age matching model
is in excellent agreement with these new measurements. We also employ a galaxy
group finder and show that our model is able to predict: (1) the relative SFRs
of central and satellite galaxies, (2) the SFR-dependence of the radial
distribution of satellite galaxy populations within galaxy groups, rich groups,
and clusters and their surrounding larger scale environments, and (3) the
interesting feature that the satellite quenched fraction as a function of
projected radial distance from the central galaxy exhibits an ~ r^-.15 slope,
independent of environment. The accurate prediction for the spatial
distribution of satellites is intriguing given the fact that we do not
explicitly model satellite-specific processes after infall, and that in our
model the virial radius does not mark a special transition region in the
evolution of a satellite, contrary to most galaxy evolution models. The success
of the model suggests that present-day galaxy SFR is strongly correlated with
halo mass assembly history.

nova outflow and a dense external shell (DES) and its associated thermal X-ray,
optical, and radio emission. The forward shock is radiative initially when the
density of shocked gas is highest, at which times radio emission originates
from the dense cooling layer immediately downstream of the shock. The radio
light curve is characterized by sharper rises to maximum and later peak times
at progressively lower frequencies, with a peak brightness temperature that is
approximately independent of frequency. We apply our model to the recent
gamma-ray classical nova V1324 Sco, obtaining an adequate fit to the early
radio maximum for reasonable assumptions about the fast nova outflow and
assuming the DES possesses a velocity ~1e3 km/s and mass ~ 2e-4 M_sun; the
former is consistent with the velocities of narrow line absorption systems
observed previously in nova spectra, while the total ejecta mass of the DES and
fast outflow is consistent with that inferred independently by modeling the
late radio peak. Rapid evolution of the early radio light curves require the
DES possess a steep outer density profile, which may indicate that the onset of
mass loss from the white dwarf was rapid, providing indirect evidence that the
DES was expelled by the thermonuclear runaway event. Reprocessed X-rays from
the shock absorbed by the DES at early times may contribute significantly to
the optical/UV emission, which we speculate is responsible for the previously
unexplained `plateaus' and secondary maxima in nova optical light curves.

41.5$ kpc) and R = 526"" ($\sim 45.5$ kpc) along the SE major axis. The second
moment for a non-parametric estimate of the full velocity distribution is $420

in the velocity profiles for two kinematically distinct stellar components at
the position of our pointing. Under this assumption we employ a two-Gaussian

$446 \pm 43$ km/s respectively. The asymmetry seen in the velocity profiles
suggests that the stellar halo of M87 is not in a relaxed state and confuses a
clean dynamical interpretation. That said, either measurement (full or two
component model) shows a rising velocity dispersion at large radii, consistent
with previous integrated light measurements, yet significantly higher than
globular cluster measurements at comparable radial positions. These integrated
light measurements at large radii, and the stark contrast they make to the
measurements of other kinematic tracers, highlight the rich kinematic
complexity of environments like the center of the Virgo Cluster and the need

is predicted by hierarchical galaxy formation models. We present a detailed
analysis of this problem by comparing predictions from the GALFORM
semi-analytic model with an extensive compilation of data on the average star
formation rates of star-forming galaxies. We also use this data to infer the
form of the stellar mass assembly histories of star forming galaxies. Our
analysis reveals that the currently available data favour a scenario where the
stellar mass assembly histories of star forming galaxies rise at early times
and then fall towards the present day. In contrast, our model predicts stellar
mass assembly histories that are almost flat below z = 2 for star forming
galaxies, such that the predicted star formation rates can be offset with
respect to the observational data by factors of up to 2-3. This disagreement
can be explained by the level of coevolution between stellar and halo mass
assembly that exists in contemporary galaxy formation models. In turn, this
arises because the standard implementations of star formation and supernova
feedback used in the models result in the efficiencies of these process
remaining approximately constant over the lifetime of a given star forming
galaxy. We demonstrate how a modification to the timescale for gas ejected by
feedback to be reincorporated into galaxy haloes can help to reconcile the
model predictions with the data.

radial-drift barrier, i.e. the accretion of dust particles onto the central
star by radial migration. The outcome of the dust radial migration is governed
by simple criteria between the dust-to-gas ratio and the exponents p and q of
the surface density and temperature power laws. The transfer of radiation
provides an additional constraint between these quantities because the disc
thermal structure is fixed by the dust spatial distribution. To assess which
discs are primarily affected by the radial-drift barrier, we used the radiative
transfer code MCFOST to compute the temperature structure of a wide range of
disc models, stressing the particular effects of grain size distributions and
vertical settling.
  We find that the outcome of the dust migration process is very sensitive to
the physical conditions within the disc. For high dust-to-gas ratios (> 0.01)
or flattened disc structures (H/R < 0.05), growing dust grains can efficiently
decouple from the gas, leading to a high concentration of grains at a critical
radius of a few AU. Decoupling of grains can occur at a large fraction (> 0.1)
of the initial radius, for a dust-to-gas ratio greater than ~ 0.05. The exact
value of the required dust-to-gas ratio for dust to stop its migration is
strongly dependent on the disc temperature structure. Non growing dust grains
are accreted for discs with flat surface density profiles (p<0.7) while they
always remain in the disc if the surface density is steep enough (p>1.2). Both
the presence of large grains and vertical settling tend to favour the accretion
of non growing dust grains onto the central object, but it slows down the
migration of growing dust grains. All the disc configurations are found to have
favourable temperature profiles over most of the disc to retain their
planetesimals.

to the classical problem 2-SAT, the counting problem #2-QSAT of determining the

However, if we consider random instances of #2-QSAT in which constraints are

entangled, which more readily give rise to long-range constraints.

efficiently solvable families of #2-QSAT instances. We consider #2-QSAT
involving only discrete distributions over tensor product operators, which

CO-H2 conversion factor. We find that in conditions akin to those in the local

fraction is almost insensitive to the CO integrated intensity threshold used to
discriminate between CO-bright and CO-dark gas, as long as this threshold is
less than 10 K km/s. The CO-dark molecular gas primarily resides in extremely
long (>100 pc) filaments that are stretched between spiral arms by galactic
shear. Only the centres of these filaments are bright in CO, suggesting that
filamentary molecular clouds observed in the Milky Way may only be small parts
of much larger structures. The CO-dark molecular gas mainly exists in a
partially molecular phase which accounts for a significant fraction of the
total disc mass budget. The dark gas fraction is higher in simulations with
higher ambient UV fields or lower surface densities, implying that external
galaxies with these conditions might have a greater proportion of dark gas.

called modified-PCP, that allows us to use this knowledge. We derive its
correctness result which shows that, when the available subspace knowledge is
accurate, modified-PCP indeed requires significantly weaker incoherence
assumptions than PCP. Extensive simulations are also used to illustrate this.
Comparisons with PCP and other existing work are shown for a stylized real
application as well. Finally, we explain how this problem naturally occurs in
many applications involving time series data, i.e. in what is called the online

terminate in big crunch singularities. It has been conjectured, however, that
the fundamental theory may resolve these singularities and replace them by
nonsingular bounces. This may have important implications for the beginning of
the multiverse. Geodesics in cosmological spacetimes are known to be
past-incomplete, as long as the average expansion rate along the geodesic is
positive, but it is not clear that the latter condition is satisfied if the
geodesic repeatedly passes through crunching AdS bubbles. We investigate this
issue in a simple multiverse model, where the spacetime consists of a patchwork
of FRW regions. The conclusion is that the spacetime is still past-incomplete,
even in the presence of AdS bounces.

recommender systems where some users of a website rate some items, such as
movies, and the goal is to recover the ratings of some or all of the unrated
items of each user. In particular, we consider both the clustering model, where
only users (or items) are clustered, and the co-clustering model, where both
users and items are clustered, and further, we assume that some users rate many
items (information-rich users) and some users rate only a few items
(information-sparse users). When users (or items) are clustered, our algorithm
can recover the rating matrix with $\omega(MK \log M)$ noisy entries while $MK$
entries are necessary, where $K$ is the number of clusters and $M$ is the
number of items. In the case of co-clustering, we prove that $K^2$ entries are
necessary for recovering the rating matrix, and our algorithm achieves this
lower bound within a logarithmic factor when $K$ is sufficiently large. We
compare our algorithms with a well-known algorithms called alternating
minimization (AM), and a similarity score-based algorithm known as the
popularity-among-friends (PAF) algorithm by applying all three to the MovieLens
and Netflix data sets. Our co-clustering algorithm and AM have similar overall
error rates when recovering the rating matrix, both of which are lower than the
error rate under PAF. But more importantly, the error rate of our co-clustering
algorithm is significantly lower than AM and PAF in the scenarios of interest
in recommender systems: when recommending a few items to each user or when
recommending items to users who only rated a few items (these users are the
majority of the total user population). The performance difference increases
even more when noise is added to the datasets.

Lagrangian of the formulated nonconvex multiwell variational problem is equal
to the energy of the best adapted to the loading microstructures plus the cost

collapsed gas in starless minihalos, whose mass function can be very sensitive
to the SSPS. As specific examples, we consider the effects of neutrino mass,
running spectral index (RSI) and warm dark matter (WDM) on the SSPS, and
evaluate the expected distribution in optical depth of 21 cm absorbers out to
different redshifts. Within the current constraints on quantities such as the
sum of neutrino masses $\sum m_\nu$, running of the primordial spectral index
$d n_s/d \ln k$ and WDM particle mass $m_{\rm WDM}$, the statistics of the 21

electrodynamics, is developed for three-dimensional open optical systems.
Results are presented using the analytically solvable homogeneous dielectric
sphere as unperturbed system. Since any perturbation which breaks the spherical
symmetry mixes transverse electric (TE) and transverse magnetic (TM) modes, the
RSE is extended here to include TM modes and a zero-frequency pole of the
Green's function. We demonstrate the validity of the RSE for TM modes by
verifying its convergence towards the exact result for a homogeneous
perturbation of the sphere. We then apply the RSE to calculate the modes for a
selection of perturbations sequentially reducing the remaining symmetry, given
by a change of the dielectric constant of half-sphere and quarter-sphere shape.
Since no exact solutions are known for these perturbations, we verify the RSE
results by comparing them with the results of state of the art finite element
method (FEM) and finite difference in time domain (FDTD) solvers. We find that
for the selected perturbations, the RSE provides a significantly higher
accuracy than the FEM and FDTD for a given computational effort, demonstrating
its potential to supersede presently used methods. We furthermore show that in
contrast to presently used methods, the RSE is able to determine the
perturbation of a selected group of modes by using a limited basis local to
these modes, which can further reduce the computational effort by orders of
magnitude.

to extract components responsible for the key dynamical features of the system.
Unfortunately, these approaches often require intuition to apply. In this
manuscript we propose a practical algorithm for the reduction of biochemical
reaction systems using fast-slow asymptotics. This method allows the ranking of
system variables according to how quickly they approach their momentary steady
state, thus selecting the fastest for a steady state approximation. We applied
this method to derive models of the Nuclear Factor kappa B network, a key
regulator of the immune response that exhibits oscillatory dynamics. Analyses
with respect to two specific solutions, which corresponded to different
experimental conditions identified different components of the system that were
responsible for the respective dynamics. This is an important demonstration of
how reduction methods that provide approximations around a specific steady
state, could be utilised in order to gain a better understanding of network
topology in a broader context.

(~24hr) rhythms autonomously. These self-sustained rhythms are coordinated and
entrained by a master circadian clock in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN).
Within the SCN, the individual rhythms of each neuron are synchronized through
intercellular signaling. One important feature of SCN is that the synchronized
period is close to the cell population mean of intrinsic periods. In this way,
the synchronized period of the SCN stays close to the periods of cells in
peripheral tissues. This is important for SCN to entrain cells throughout the
body. However, the mechanism that drives the period of the coupled SCN cells to
the population mean is not known. We use mathematical modeling and analysis to
show that the mechanism of transcription repression plays a pivotal role in
regulating the coupled period. Specifically, we use phase response curve
analysis to show that the coupled period within the SCN stays near the
population mean if transcriptional repression occurs via protein sequestration.
In contrast, the coupled period is far from the mean if repression occurs
through highly nonlinear Hill-type regulation (e.g. oligomer- or
phosphorylation-based repression). Furthermore, we find that the timescale of
intercellular coupling needs to be fast compared to that of intracellular
feedback to maintain the mean period. These findings reveal the important
relationship between the intracellular transcriptional feedback loop and
intercellular coupling. This relationship explains why transcriptional
repression appears to occur via protein sequestration in multicellular
organisms, mammals and Drosophila, in contrast with the phosphorylation-based
repression in unicellular organisms. That is, transition to protein
sequestration is essential for synchronizing multiple cells with a period close
to the population mean (~24hr).

proposed CFO compensation technique is applicable to all types of subcarrier

non-local, the extent of the nonlocality being governed by a single parameter
$\rho$. The prototypes of these operators arose in earlier work as averages of
matrix operators meant to describe the propagation of a scalar field in a
causal set. We generalize the original definitions to produce an infinite
family of ''Generalized Causet Box (GCB) operators'' parametrized by certain
coefficients $\{a,b_n\}$, and we derive the conditions on the latter needed for
the usual d'Alembertian to be recovered in the infrared limit. The continuum
average of a GCB operator is an integral operator, and it is these continuum
operators that we mainly study. To that end, we compute their action on plane
waves, or equivalently their Fourier transforms g(p) [p being the
momentum-vector]. For timelike p, g(p) has an imaginary part whose sign depends
on whether p is past or future-directed. For small p, g(p) is necessarily
proportional to p.p, but for large p it becomes constant, raising the
possibility of a genuinely Lorentzian perturbative regulator for quantum field
theory. We also address the question of whether or not the evolution defined by
the GCB operators is stable, finding evidence that the original 4D causal set
d'Alembertian is unstable, while its 2D counterpart is stable.

for sequences of independent random variables. If the growth condition on
$(n_k)_{k \geq 1}$ is relaxed then this almost-independent behavior generally
fails. Still, probabilistic constructions show that for \emph{some} very slowly
increasing sequences $(n_k)_{k \geq 1}$ this almost-independence property is
preserved. For example, there exists $(n_k)_{k \geq 1}$ having bounded gaps
such that the normalized sums $\sum \cos 2 \pi n_k x$ satisfy the central limit
theorem (CLT). However, due to a ``loss of mass'' phenomenon the variance in
the CLT for a sequence with bounded gaps is always smaller than $1/2$. In the
case of the law of the iterated logarithm (LIL) the situation is different; as
we proved in an earlier paper, there exists $(n_k)_{k \geq 1}$ with bounded
gaps such that $$ \limsup_{N \to \infty} \frac{\left| \sum_{k=1}^N \cos 2 \pi

prescribed limsup-behavior in the LIL is possible for sequences with bounded
gaps. More precisely, we show that for any real number $\Lambda \geq 0$ there
exists a sequence of integers $(n_k)_{k \geq 1}$ satisfying $n_{k+1} - n_{k}
\in \{1,2\}$ such that the limsup in the LIL equals $\Lambda$ for almost all

equilibrium prices to contract (in a manner given by a cusp catastrophe),
causing prices to plummet discontinuously and banks to become insolvent.
Successive positive and negative shocks of equal magnitude do not cancel;
rather, a banking catastrophe can occur even if beliefs simply return to their
initial state. Capital requirements can prevent crises by curtailing the
expansion of balance sheets when beliefs become more optimistic, but they can
also force larger price declines. Emergency asset price supports can be
understood as attempts by a central bank to coordinate expectations on an
equilibrium with solvency.

Orlicz $\phi$-mixed volume of $K$ and the polar body of $L$, where $L$ runs
over all star bodies and all convex bodies, respectively, with volume of $L$

algebraic multigrid preconditioning technique for the solution of large sparse

hierarchical coarse grids are constructed through aggregation of the fine grid
nodes. These aggregations are obtained using a set of maximal independent nodes

finding a maximal independent set from a graph of strong negative connections.
The aggregations are combined with a piece-wise constant (unsmooth)
interpolation from the coarse grid solution to the fine grid solution, ensuring
low setup and interpolation cost. The grid independent convergence is achieved
by using recursive Krylov iterations (K-cycles) in the solve stage. An
efficient combination of K-cycles and standard multigrid V-cycles is used as
the preconditioner for Krylov iterative solvers such as generalized minimal
residual and conjugate gradient. We compare the solver performance with other

integrate the equation to find solitary waves. It is found that these solutions
are well approximated by a truncated series of hyperbolic secants. The

reduction of the RSPE to the nonlinear Schr\""odinger equation, we are able to
construct (both standing and traveling) envelope wave breather type solutions
of the former, based on the solitary wave structures of the latter. Both the

mechanism considers the status (current energy level in terms of Joules) of
each node, link condition (number of transmissions that the Cluster Head

transition kernel can be evaluated directly from the increment distribution of
the associated random walk. This process is shown to approximate the
conditional process of interest in total variation. Then, by analyzing the

the overshoot on the target set. These types of joint conditional limit

shown to lead to enhanced scattering of carrier light by the ultrasonic
acoustic modes of the test mass mirrors. At high optical power, this can lead
to parametric instability (parametric gain R > 1) for a few acoustic modes with
strong spectral and spatial overlap. Numerous ?~10^3 acoustic modes of the test
masses are predicted to have R > 10^2. Experimental studies have shown that
such modes also strongly scatter the carrier light, enabling very sensitive
readout of the acoustic modes. The 3-mode scattering from the thermal
fluctuation of large population of ultrasonic modes would causes random changes
in occupation number of the carrier light and cavity transverse optical modes.
Because the thermal fluctuation time scale (set by the acoustic mode relaxation
times) is typically a few seconds, the noise spectrum from thermally induced
photon number fluctuations is strongly peaked at low frequency. The noise level
depends on the acoustic mode structure and acoustic losses of the test masses,
the transverse optical mode spectrum of the optical cavities and on the test
mass temperature. We theoretically investigate the possible effect of this
noise and show that in advanced detectors under construction three mode
interaction noise is below the standard quantum limit, but could set limits on
future low frequency detectors that aim to exceed the free mass standard
quantum limit.

lensing light curve. In this process, it is often confronted that solutions of
different lensing parameters result in similar light curves, causing
difficulties in uniquely interpreting the lens system, and thus understanding
the causes of different types of degeneracy is important. In this work, we show
that incomplete coverage of a planetary perturbation can result in degenerate
solutions even for events where the planetary signal is detected with a high
level of statistical significance. We demonstrate the degeneracy for an
actually observed event OGLE-2012-BLG-0455/MOA-2012-BLG-206. The peak of this
high-magnification event $(A_{\rm max}\sim400)$ exhibits very strong deviation
from a point-lens model with $\Delta\chi^{2}\gtrsim4000$ for data sets with a
total number of measurement 6963. From detailed modeling of the light curve, we
find that the deviation can be explained by four distinct solutions, i.e., two
very different sets of solutions, each with a two-fold degeneracy. While the
two-fold (so-called ""close/wide"") degeneracy is well-understood, the degeneracy
between the radically different solutions is not previously known. The model
light curves of this degeneracy differ substantially in the parts that were not
covered by observation, indicating that the degeneracy is caused by the
incomplete coverage of the perturbation. It is expected that the frequency of
the degeneracy introduced in this work will be greatly reduced with the
improvement of the current lensing survey and follow-up experiments and the
advent of new surveys.

apply to field stars, but also by large systematic uncertainties related to
circumstellar phenomena. In this paper, we analyze flux calibrated optical
spectra to measure accurate spectral types and extinctions of 283 nearby T
Tauri stars. The primary advances in this paper are (1) the incorporation of a
simplistic accretion continuum in optical spectral type and extinction
measurements calculated over the full optical wavelength range and (2) the
uniform analysis of a large sample of stars. Comparisons between the
non-accreting TTS photospheric templates and stellar photosphere models are
used to derive conversions from spectral type to temperature. Differences
between spectral types can be subtle and difficult to discern, especially when
accounting for accretion and extinction. The spectral types measured here are
mostly consistent with spectral types measured over the past decade. However,
our new spectral types are 1-2 subclasses later than literature spectral types
for the original members of the TWA and are discrepant with literature values
for some well known Taurus CTTSs. Our extinction measurements are consistent
with other optical extinction measurements but are typically 1 mag lower than
nIR measurements, likely the result of methodological differences and the
presence of nIR excesses in most CTTSs. As an illustration of the impact of
accretion, SpT, and extinction uncertainties on the HR diagrams of young
clusters, we find that the resulting luminosity spread of stars in the TWA is
15-30%. The luminosity spread in the TWA and previously measured for binary
stars in Taurus suggests that for a majority of stars, protostellar accretion
rates are not large enough to significantly alter the subsequent evolution.

directional information computable from the sample statistical moments of the
design variables within a Monte Carlo setup, is proposed. The search is aided
by imparting to a directional update term, which parallels the conventional
Gateaux derivative used in a local search for the extrema of smooth cost
functionals, additional layers of random perturbations referred to as
'coalescence' and 'scrambling'. A selection scheme, constituting yet another
avenue for random perturbation, completes the global search. The
direction-driven nature of the search is manifest in the local extremization
and coalescence components, which are posed as martingale problems that yield
gain-like update terms upon discretization. As anticipated and numerically
demonstrated, to a limited extent, against the problem of parameter recovery
given the chaotic response histories of a couple of nonlinear oscillators, the
proposed method apparently provides for a more rational, more accurate and
faster alternative to most available evolutionary schemes, prominently the
particle swarm optimization.

located inside a single-mode cavity with a movable mirror. The cavity mode is
driven by a short laser pulse, has a nonlinear parametric-type interaction with
the mirror and a linear beamsplitter-type interaction with the atomic ensemble.
There is no direct interaction of the mirror with the atomic ensemble. A
threshold effect for the dynamics of the system is found, above which the
system works as an amplifier and below which as an attenuator of the output
fields. The threshold is determined by the ratio of the coupling strengths of
the cavity mode to the mirror and to the atomic ensemble. It is shown that
above the threshold the system effectively behaves as a two-mode system in
which a perfect bipartite EPR state can be generated, while it is impossible
below the threshold. Furthermore, a fully inseparable tripartite entanglement
and even further a genuine tripartite entanglement can be produced above and
below the threshold. In addition, we consider quantum steering and examine the
monogamy relations that quantify the amount of bipartite steering that can be
shared between different modes. It is found that the mirror is more capable for
steering of entanglement than the cavity mode. The two way steering is found
between the mirror and the atomic ensemble despite the fact that they are not
directly coupled to each other, while it is impossible between the output of
cavity mode and the ensemble which are directly coupled to each other.

data set from intensive monitoring observations in optical and near-infrared
wavelength bands with the dedicated 2-m MAGNUM telescope to obtain the
distances to 17 AGNs in the redshift range z=0.0024 to z=0.0353. These distance
measurements are compared with distances measured using Cepheid variable stars,
and are used to infer that H_0= 73 +- 3 (random) km/s/Mpc. The systematic error
in H_0 is examined, and the uncertainty in the size distribution of dust grains
is the largest source of the systematic error, which is much reduced for a
sample of AGNs for which their parameter values in the model of dust
reverberation are individually measured. This AGN time-lag method can be used
beyond 30 Mpc, the farthest distance reached by extragalactic Cepheids, and can
be extended to high-redshift quasi-stellar objects.

nearby, low-mass, Fornax cluster, from which we derive spatially resolved
stellar kinematics. Based on the morphologies of their stellar velocity maps we
classify 2/10 galaxies as slow rotators, with the remaining 8 galaxies fast
rotators.
  Supplementing our integral field observations with morphological and
kinematic data from the literature, we analyse the `kinematic' type of all 30
galaxies in the Fornax cluster brighter than M_K = -21.5 mag (M_* ~ 6 x 10^9
M_sun). Our sample's slow rotator fraction within one virial radius is
7(^+4_-6) per cent. 13(^+8_-6} per cent of the early-type galaxies are slow
rotators, consistent with the observed fraction in other galaxy aggregates. The
fraction of slow rotators in Fornax varies with cluster-centric radius, rising
to 16(^+11_-8) per cent of all kinematic types within the central 0.2 virial
radii, from 0 per cent in the cluster outskirts.
  We find that, even in mass-matched samples of slow and fast rotators, slow
rotators are found preferentially at higher projected environmental density
than fast rotators. This demonstrates that dynamical friction alone cannot be
responsible for the differing distributions of slow and fast rotators. For
dynamical friction to play a significant role, slow rotators must reside in
higher mass sub-halos than fast rotators and/or form in the centres of groups
before being accreted on to the cluster.

the apparent dearth of these objects in cosmological simulation poses
challenging problem to the standard cold dark matter paradigm. Irrespective of
mergers or accretion that a galaxy might be going through, stars are heated as
they get older while they interact with the spirals and bars which are
ubiquitous in disc galaxies -- leading to a puffed up stellar disc. It remains
unclear how superthin galaxies maintain their thinness through the cosmic
evolution.
  We follow the internal evolution of a sample of 16 initially extremely thin
stellar discs using collisionless N-body simulation. All of these discs
eventually form a bar in their central region. Depending on the initial
condition, some of these stellar discs readily form strong bars while others
grow weak bars over secular evolution time scale. We show that galaxies with
strong bars heat the stars very efficiently, eventually making their stellar
discs thicker. On the other hand, stars are heated very slowly by weak bars --
as a result, galaxies hosting weak bars are able to maintain their thinness
over several billion years, if left isolated. We suggest that some of the
superthin galaxies might as well be forming weak bars and thereby prevent any
strong vertical heating which in turn helps maintaining their thinness during
the course of secular evolution.

shrink to the uniform steady state, or expand, depending on whether they are
smaller or larger, respectively, than a critical nucleus. This critical nucleus
for wave propagation is modified by the curvature acting like an effective
space-dependent local spatial coupling, similar to diffusion, thus extending
the regime of propagating excitation waves beyond the excitation threshold of
flat surfaces. In particular, a negative gradient of Gaussian curvature
$\Gamma$, as on the outside of a torus surface (positive $\Gamma$), when the
wave segment symmetrically extends into the inside (negative $\Gamma$), allows
for stable propagation of localized wave segments remaining unchanged in size

dense clusters is tidal disruption during the flyby of another cluster member.
The degree of mass loss in such an encounter depends, among other parameters,
on the distribution of the material within the disc. Previous work showed that
this is especially so in encounters that truncate large parts of the outer
disc. The expectation is that the number of completely destroyed discs in a
cluster depends also on the mass distribution within the discs. Here we test
this hypothesis by determining the influence of encounters on the disc fraction
and average disc mass in clusters of various stellar densities for different
mass distributions in the discs. This is done by performing Nbody6 simulation
of a variety of cluster environments, where we track the encounter dynamics and
determine the mass loss due to these encounters for different disc-mass
distributions. We find that although the disc mass distribution has a
significant impact on the disc losses for specific star-disc encounters, the
overall disc frequency generally remains rather unaffected. The reason is that
in single encounters the dependence on the mass distribution is strongest if
both stars have very different masses. Such encounters are rather infrequent in
sparse clusters. In dense clusters such encounters are more common, however,
here the disc frequency is largely determined by encounters between low-mass
stars such that the overall disc frequency does not change significantly. For
tidal disruption the disc destruction in clusters is fairly independent of the
actual distribution of the material in the disc. The all determining factor
remains the cluster density.

equations arises in several applications (e.g. signal and image processing,
compressive sensing, statistical inference). A standard tool for dealing with
sparse recovery is the $\ell_1$-regularized least-squares approach that has
been recently attracting the attention of many researchers. In this paper, we
describe an active set estimate (i.e. an estimate of the indices of the zero
variables in the optimal solution) for the considered problem that tries to
quickly identify as many active variables as possible at a given point, while
guaranteeing that some approximate optimality conditions are satisfied. A
relevant feature of the estimate is that it gives a significant reduction of
the objective function when setting to zero all those variables estimated
active. This enables to easily embed it into a given globally converging
algorithmic framework. In particular, we include our estimate into a block
coordinate descent algorithm for $\ell_1$-regularized least squares, analyze
the convergence properties of this new active set method, and prove that its
basic version converges with linear rate. Finally, we report some numerical
results showing the effectiveness of the approach.

atomic block protects a piece of code and ensures that it runs without
interruption from other threads. Our technique uses a verification tool as a
subroutine to find the smallest atomic regions that remove all bugs in a given
program. Keeping the atomic regions small allows for maximum concurrency. We
have implemented our approach in a tool called AtomicInf. A user of AtomicInf
can choose between strong and weak atomicity semantics for the inferred fix.
While the former is simpler to find, the latter provides more information about
the bugs that got fixed.
  We ran AtomicInf on several benchmarks and came up with the smallest and the
most precise atomic regions in all of them. We implemented an earlier technique
to our setting and observed that AtomicInf is 1.7 times faster on an average as

interesting case arises for conditional algorithmic mutual information. In this
case, the random Hilberg exponents are almost surely constant on ergodic
sources and are bounded by the expected Hilberg exponents. This property is a

underlying probability measure via Shannon-Fano coding and Barron inequality.
Moreover, the expected Hilberg exponents can be linked for different universal

are greater for the former than for the latter. The paper is concluded by an
evaluation of Hilberg exponents for certain sources such as the mixture

$\Delta(6n^2)$ flavour symmetry provides many examples of viable predictions

from residual flavour and CP symmetries where $\alpha_{21}$ can take several

in likelihood and Bayesian inference for diffusion processes. First a simple
method of simulating approximate diffusion bridges is proposed and studied.
Then these approximate bridges are used as proposal for an easily implemented
Metropolis-Hastings algorithm that produces exact diffusion bridges. The new
method utilizes time-reversibility properties of one-dimensional diffusions and
is applicable to all one-dimensional diffusion processes with finite
speed-measure. One advantage of the new approach is that simple simulation
methods like the Milstein scheme can be applied to bridge simulation. Another
advantage over previous bridge simulation methods is that the proposed method
works well for diffusion bridges in long intervals because the computational
complexity of the method is linear in the length of the interval. For
$\rho$-mixing diffusions the approximate method is shown to be particularly
accurate for long time intervals. In a simulation study, we investigate the
accuracy and efficiency of the approximate method and compare it to exact
simulation methods. In the study, our method provides a very good approximation
to the distribution of a diffusion bridge for bridges that are likely to occur
in applications to statistical inference. To illustrate the usefulness of the
new method, we present an EM-algorithm for a discretely observed diffusion

with L > 1 E+40 erg/s -- remain something of a mystery. Spectral roll-over in
the 5-10 keV band was originally detected in in the deepest XMM-Newton
observations of the brightest sources; this is confirmed in subsequent NuSTAR
spectra. This emission can be modeled via Comptonization, but with low electron
temperatures (kT_e ~ 2 keV) and high optical depths (tau ~ 10) that pose
numerous difficulties. Moreover, evidence of cooler thermal emission that can
be fit with thin disk models persists, even in fits to joint XMM-Newton and
NuSTAR observations. Using NGC 1313 X-1 as a test case, we show that a patchy
disk with a multiple temperature profile may provide an excellent description
of such spectra. In principle, a number of patches within a cool disk might
emit over a range of temperatures, but the data only require a two-temperature
profile plus standard Comptonization, or three distinct blackbody components. A
mechanism such as the photon bubble instability may naturally give rise to a
patchy disk profile, and could give rise to super-Eddington luminosities. It is
possible, then, that a patchy disk (rather than a disk with a standard
single-temperature profile) might be a hallmark of accretion disks close to or
above the Eddington limit. We discuss further tests of this picture, and
potential implications for sources such as narrow-line Seyfert-1 galaxies
(NLSy1s) and other low-mass active galactic nuclei (AGN).

interaction $J$ is interpreted as a mutual communication among individuals
forming a society. The thermal fluctuations introduce a noise $T$ into the
communication, which suppresses long-range correlations. Below a certain phase
transition point $T_t$, large-scale clusters of the individuals, who share a
specific dominant property, are formed. The measure of the cluster sizes is an
order parameter after spontaneous symmetry breaking. By means of the Corner
transfer matrix renormalization group algorithm, we treat our model in the
thermodynamic limit and classify the phase transitions with respect to inherent
degrees of freedom. Each individual is chosen to possess two independent
features $f=2$ and each feature can assume one of $q$ traits (e.g. interests).
Hence, each individual is described by $q^2$ degrees of freedom. A single first
order phase transition is detected in our model if $q>2$, whereas two distinct
continuous phase transitions are found if $q=2$ only. Evaluating the free
energy, order parameters, specific heat, and the entanglement von Neumann
entropy, we classify the phase transitions $T_t(q)$ in detail. The permanent
existence of the ordered phase (the large-scale cluster formation with a
non-zero order parameter) is conjectured below a non-zero transition point
$T_t(q)\approx0.5$ in the asymptotic regime $q\to\infty$.

dwarf galaxies is considered to depend on a random variable, the tidal index
theta, an environmental parameter defined by Karachentsev et al. (2004), such
that for theta less than zero, the formation of dwarf irregular galaxy is
assured whereas for theta greater than zero, the formation of dwarf ellipticals
is preferred. It is found that for particular ranges of the interactive
parameters the model predictions are in good agreement with the observed number
density of the different galaxy types as a function of space density in four
clusters of galaxies. This supports the fact that galaxy interactions do not
all necessarily give rise to the formation of either dwarf irregulars or dwarf
ellipticals. It is also shown that the formation of dwarf irregulars at high
densities is much lower than that of dwarf ellipticals, and that the formation
of the latter reaches a maximum at a particular space density, unlike the
former. This suggests that at high densities many dwarf irregulars are stripped
of their gaseous envelopes to become dwarf elliptical.

operator $\mathcal H^{-1}_e$ that arises when the interior problem is reduced
to a problem of inverting the Hilbert transform from incomplete data. The
asymptotics of the singular values and singular functions of $\mathcal
H^{-1}_e$, the latter being valid uniformly on compact subsets {of the interior

accurately measure the degree of ill-posedness of the analytic continuation as

$a_\mu^c = 14.42(39)\times 10^{-10}$. These are in good agreement with

clearly established, the detailed structure of the entire Higgs sector is yet
unclear. Besides the Standard Model interpretation, various possibilities for
extended Higgs sectors are being considered. The minimal supersymmetric
extension (MSSM) features two Higgs doublets resulting in five physical Higgs
bosons, which are subject to direct searches. Alternatively, more generic
Two-Higgs Doublet models (2HDM) are used for the interpretation of results. The
Next-to-Minimal Supersymmetric Model (NMSSM) has a more complex Higgs sector
with seven physical states. Also exotic Higgs bosons decaying to invisible
final states are considered. This article summarizes recent findings based on
results from collider experiments.

rather with generalized pseudo effect algebras where the greatest element is

Supplementary Information available upon request",,"10.1371/journal.pone.0101851",,"q-bio.PE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Social ecological systems are often difficult to investigate and manage
because of their inherent complexity1. Small variations in external drivers can
lead to abrupt changes associated with instabilities and bifurcations in the
underlying dynamics2-4. Anticipating critical transitions and divergence from
the present state of the system is particularly crucial to the prevention or
mitigation of the effects of unwanted and irreversible changes5-10. Recent
research in ecology has focused on leading indicators of regime shift in
ecosystems characterized by one state variable5,7,11,12. The case of systems
with several mutually interacting components, however, has remained poorly
investigated13, while the connection between network stability and research on
indicators for loss of resilience has been elusive14. Here we develop a
theoretical framework to analyze early warning signs of instability and regime
shift in social ecological networks. We provide analytical expressions for a
set of precursors of instability in social ecological systems with additive
noise for a variety of network structures. In particular, we show that the
covariance matrix of the dynamics can effectively anticipate the emergence of
instability. We also compare signals of early warning based on the dynamics of
suitably selected nodes, to indicators based on the integrated behavior of the
whole network. We find that the performances of these indicators are affected
by the network structure and the type of interaction among nodes. These results
provide new advances in multidimensional early warning analysis and offer a
framework to evaluate the resilience of social ecological networks.

(LRRSC) method for robust subspace clustering. Given a collection of data
points approximately drawn from multiple subspaces, the proposed technique can
simultaneously recover the dimension and members of each subspace. LRRSC
extends the original low-rank representation algorithm by integrating a
symmetric constraint into the low-rankness property of high-dimensional data
representation. The symmetric low-rank representation, which preserves the
subspace structures of high-dimensional data, guarantees weight consistency for
each pair of data points so that highly correlated data points of subspaces are
represented together. Moreover, it can be efficiently calculated by solving a
convex optimization problem. We provide a rigorous proof for minimizing the
nuclear-norm regularized least square problem with a symmetric constraint. The
affinity matrix for spectral clustering can be obtained by further exploiting
the angular information of the principal directions of the symmetric low-rank
representation. This is a critical step towards evaluating the memberships
between data points. Experimental results on benchmark databases demonstrate
the effectiveness and robustness of LRRSC compared with several
state-of-the-art subspace clustering algorithms.

indoor environments. The system uses off-the-shelf LED lamps as signal sources,
and uses light sensors as signal receivers. The design is inspired by the
observation that a light sensor has deterministic sensitivity to both distance
and incident angle of light signal, an under-utilized feature of photodiodes
now widely found on mobile devices. We develop a stable and accurate light
intensity model to capture the phenomenon, based on which a new positioning
principle, Multi-Face Light Positioning (MFLP), is established that uses three
collocated sensors to uniquely determine the receiver's position, assuming
merely a single source of light. We have implemented a prototype on both
dedicated embedded systems and smartphones. Experimental results show average
positioning accuracy within 0.4 meters across different environments, with high
stability against interferences from obstacles, ambient lights, temperature
variation, etc.

at different granularities, including city, state, time zone or geographic
region, using the content of users tweets and their tweeting behavior. Unlike
existing approaches, our algorithm uses an ensemble of statistical and
heuristic classifiers to predict locations and makes use of a geographic
gazetteer dictionary to identify place-name entities. We find that a
hierarchical classification approach, where time zone, state or geographic
region is predicted first and city is predicted next, can improve prediction
accuracy. We have also analyzed movement variations of Twitter users, built a
classifier to predict whether a user was travelling in a certain period of time
and use that to further improve the location detection accuracy. Experimental
evidence suggests that our algorithm works well in practice and outperforms the
best existing algorithms for predicting the home location of Twitter users.

  Networks with Explicit Power Setpoints","71 pages, 21 figures, 5 tables",,,,"cs.SY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The conventional approach for the control of distribution networks, in the
presence of active generation and/or controllable loads and storage, involves a
combination of both frequency and voltage regulation at different time scales.
With the increased penetration of stochastic resources, distributed generation
and demand response, this approach shows severe limitations in both the optimal
and feasible operation of these networks, as well as in the aggregation of the
network resources for upper-layer power systems. An alternative approach is to
directly control the targeted grid by defining explicit and real-time setpoints
for active/reactive power absorptions/injections defined by a solution of a
specific optimization problem; but this quickly becomes intractable when
systems get large or diverse. In this paper, we address this problem and
propose a method for the explicit control of the grid status, based on a common
abstract model characterized by the main property of being composable. That is
to say, subsystems can be aggregated into virtual devices that hide their
internal complexity. Thus the proposed method can easily cope with systems of
any size or complexity. The framework is presented in this Part I, whilst in
Part II we illustrate its application to a CIGR\'E low voltage benchmark
microgrid. In particular, we provide implementation examples with respect to
typical devices connected to distribution networks and evaluate of the
performance and benefits of the proposed control framework.
