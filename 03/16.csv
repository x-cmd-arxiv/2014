sometimes can dominate the X-ray afterglow. In most of the previous studies,
only Rayleigh-Gans (RG) approximation is employed for describing the scattering
process, which works accurately for the typical size of grains (with radius
$a\leq 0.1\,{\rm \mu m}$) in the diffuse interstellar medium. When the size of

the scattered X-ray emission more accurately with potentially larger dust

find that the X-ray scattering scenarios with either AD or RG approximation

occurs when the attachment of a new tile to a growing assembly requires it to
bind to more than one tile already in the assembly. Often referred to as
``temperature-2'' systems, those which employ cooperation are known to be quite
powerful (i.e. they are computationally universal and can build an enormous
variety of shapes and structures). Conversely, aTAM systems which do not
enforce cooperative behavior, a.k.a. ``temperature-1'' systems, are conjectured
to be relatively very weak, likely to be unable to perform complex computations
or algorithmically direct the process of self-assembly. Nonetheless, a variety
of models based on slight modifications to the aTAM have been developed in
which temperature-1 systems are in fact capable of Turing universal computation
through a restricted notion of cooperation. Despite that power, though, several
of those models have previously been proven to be unable to perform or simulate
the stronger form of cooperation exhibited by temperature-2 aTAM systems.
  In this paper, we first prove that another model in which temperature-1
systems are computationally universal, namely the restricted glue TAM (rgTAM)
in which tiles are allowed to have edges which exhibit repulsive forces, is
also unable to simulate the strongly cooperative behavior of the temperature-2

Dupled Tile Assembly Model (DTAM) and the rgTAM into the DrgTAM, we derive a
model which is actually more powerful at temperature-1 than the aTAM at

Fermi satellite has identified pulsed $\gamma$-ray emission from more than 80
young pulsars, providing light curves with high statistics. Fitting the
observations with geometrical models can provide estimates of the magnetic
obliquity $\alpha$ and aspect angle $\zeta$, yielding estimates of the
radiation beaming factor and luminosity. Using $\gamma$-ray emission geometries
(Polar Cap, Slot Gap, Outer Gap, One Pole Caustic) and radio emission geometry,
we fit $\gamma$-ray light curves for 76 young pulsars and we jointly fit their
$\gamma$-ray plus radio light curves when possible. We find that a joint radio
plus $\gamma$-ray fit strategy is important to obtain ($\alpha$, $\zeta$)
estimates that can explain simultaneous radio and $\gamma$-ray emission. The
intermediate-to-high altitude magnetosphere models, Slot Gap, Outer Gap, and
One pole Caustic, are favoured in explaining the observations. We find no
evolution of $\alpha$ on a time scale of a million years. For all emission
geometries our derived $\gamma$-ray beaming factors are generally less than one
and do not significantly evolve with the spin-down power. A more pronounced
beaming factor vs. spin-down power correlation is observed for Slot Gap model
and radio-quiet pulsars and for the Outer Gap model and radio-loud pulsars. For
all models, the correlation between $\gamma$-ray luminosity and spin-down power
is consistent with a square root dependence. The $\gamma$-ray luminosities
obtained by using our beaming factors not exceed the spin-down power. This
suggests that assuming a beaming factor of one for all objects, as done in
other studies, likely overestimates the real values. The data show a relation
between the pulsar spectral characteristics and the width of the accelerator
gap that is consistent with the theoretical prediction for the Slot Gap model.

NN interaction, in a microscopic CDCC (MCDCC) model [PRL 111, 082701 (2013)]
has been successfully applied to the 7Li+208Pb scattering.
  Purpose: The MCDCC method is applied to the low energy elastic scattering of
17F, 17O and 19F on 58Ni and 208Pb targets. The goal of the calculations is
twofold - to test the adequacy and the accuracy of the MCDCC model for the
heavier projectiles, and to study the contribution of various channels to the
elastic scattering cross sections.
  Methods: The elastic scattering cross sections are calculated using the MCDCC
method. The nucleon-target optical potential is folded with the projectile
densities resulting from an effective NN interaction, which includes central
nuclear, spin-orbit and Coulomb terms. Discretization of the continuum is
achieved via the pseudo state method. Coupled equations are solved using the
R-matrix method on a Lagrange mesh.
  Results: For the test case of 17F at 10 MeV/nucleon, the cross sections are
weakly sensitive to the choice of the effective NN interaction, three different
energy dependent optical nucleon-target potentials provide a similar reasonable
agreement with data. Just below the Coulomb barrier, the MCDCC significantly
underestimates the cross sections at larger angles. The coupling to continuum
is not significant in most of the assessed cases.
  Conclusions: The MCDCC is very satisfactory in the sense, that it includes
the microscopic properties of the projectile in a reaction model. Well above
the Coulomb barrier, the cross sections are in a good agreement with data. The
reasons for the discrepancy between the data and the calculated cross sections
at the lower energies, which is also observed in a traditional CDCC, are
unclear.

accreting onto a supermassive black hole (AGNs), transition objects, or
low-ionization nuclear emission regions (LINERs). Two-thirds of our galaxies
have nuclear X-ray sources with $Swift$/UVOT counterparts. Two nuclei have

multi-wavelength AGNs and follow the known $\alpha_{\rm OX}-\nu L_{\nu,\rm near

consistent with either a low-luminosity AGN or a nuclear X-ray binary
population, and fall in the ""non-AGN locus"" in $\alpha_{\rm OX}-\nu L_{\nu,\rm

that HCG X-ray nuclei in high specific star formation rate spiral galaxies are
likely dominated by star formation, while those with low specific star
formation rates in earlier types likely harbor a weak AGN. The AGN fraction in
HCG galaxies with $M_R \le -20$ and $L_{X,{\rm 0.5-8.0 keV}} \ge 10^{41}$ erg

that employing TMC effect are cumbersome, long and contains complicated
integrals. Some of these integrals can not be solved exactly and people are
forced to use approximate methods which seems not to give sufficient and
precise results. On the other hand on analysing the TMC effect we encounter
with the threshold problem for nucleon structure which results to have the
structure function in a regions which are physically forbidden. Here we render
a new solution way, based on the re-scaled parton densities to resolve the
difficultly, relating to the TMC effect. Our solution way can be employed
directly and easily to the parton distribution rather than to the nucleon
structure function. There are different options to amend the parton densities.
What we call as third re-scaling is the best one. Using it we are able to
discard the threshold problem for the nucleon structure function without
resorting to apply some auxiliary mathematical tools like the step function
which is plausible by people . On this way we obtain a better agreement for the
nucleon structure function with the available experimental data in comparison

gold, the wide-band limit (WBL) is a particularly efficient choice. In this
paper we investigate the performance of different WBL schemes relative to more
sophisticated approaches including the fully self-consistent non-equilibrium
Green's function (NEGF) method. We find reasonably good agreement between all
schemes for systems in which the molecule (and not the metal-molecule
interface) dominates the transport properties. Moreover, our implementation of
the WBL requires negligible computational effort compared to the ground state
DFT calculation of a molecular junction. We also present a new approximate but
efficient scheme for calculating transport with a finite bias. Provided the
voltage drop occurs primarily inside the molecule, this method provides results
in reasonable agreement with fully self-consistent calculations.

to the diffusion matrix and not to the drift. Notably, this information anatomy
changes discontinuously as any of the diffusion coefficients vanishes,

equal-size particles (Pan and Padoan, Paper I) to particles of arbitrarily
different sizes. The Pan and Padoan (PP10) model shows that the relative
velocity between different particles has two contributions, named the
generalized shear and acceleration terms, respectively. The generalized shear
term represents the particles' memory of the spatial flow velocity difference
across the particle distance in the past, while the acceleration term is
associated with the temporal flow velocity difference on individual particle
trajectories. Using the simulation of Paper I, we compute the root-mean-square
relative velocity, <w^2>^1/2, as a function of the friction times, tau_p1 and
tau_p2, of the two particles, and show that the PP10 prediction is in
satisfactory agreement with the data, confirming its physical picture. For a
given tau_p1 below the Lagrangian correlation time of the flow, T_L, <w^2>^1/2
as a function of tau_p2 shows a dip at tau_p2~tau_p1, indicating tighter
velocity correlation between similar particles. Defining a ratio
f=tau_pl/tau_ph, with tau_pl and tau_ph the friction times of the smaller and
larger particles, we find that <w^2>^1/2 increases with decreasing f due to the
generalized acceleration contribution, which dominates at f<1/4. At a fixed f,
our model predicts that <w^2>^1/2 scales as tau_ph^1/2 for tau_p,h in the
inertial range of the flow, stays roughly constant for T_L <tau_ph < T_L/f, and
finally decreases as tau_ph^-1/2 for tau_ph>>T_L/f. The acceleration term is
independent of the particle distance, r, and thus reduces the r-dependence of
<w^2>^1/2 in the bidisperse case.

\cite{G} Gustafson establishes a relation between the probability of
$a_{1},a_{2}\in G$ commuting and the number of conjugacy classes in $G$.
  In this work we define several other parameters, which depend only on a
certain interplay between the conjugacy classes of $G$, and compute the
probabilities of general permutation equalities in terms of these parameters.
It turns out that this probability, for a permutation $\pi$, depends only on
the number $c(Gr(\pi))$ of the alternating cycles in the cycle graph $Gr(\pi)$
of $\pi$. The cycle graph of a permutation was introduced by V. Bafna and P. A.
Pevzner in \cite{BP}.
  We describe the spectrum of the probabilities of permutation equalities in a
finite group as $\pi$ varies over all the elements of $S_{n}$. This spectrum
turns-out to be closely related to the partition of $n!$ into a sum of the
corresponding Hultman numbers.

with a characteristic energy of half the bulk band gap. The (001) cleaved
Sn-doped BTS crystals display high quality Shubnikov de Haas (SdH) quantum
oscillations due to the topological surface state electrons. Angle resolved
photoelectron spectroscopy (ARPES) characterization shows that the Fermi energy
(EF) for the Sn-doped crystals falls cleanly in the surface states with no
interference from the bulk bands, that the Dirac point for the surface states
lies approximately 60 meV below the top of the bulk valence band maximum, and
allows for a determination of the bulk and surface state carrier concentrations
as a function of Energy near EF. Electronic structure calculations that compare
Bi excess and Sn dopants in BTS demonstrate that Sn acts as a special impurity,
with a localized impurity band that acts as a charge buffer occurring inside
the bulk band gap. We propose that the special resonant level character of Sn

provide some necessary conditions for a given profile to be a Nash equilibrium.
Furthermore, we study players' utilities in the competitive diffusion game over
Erdos-Renyi random graphs and show that as the size of the network grows, the
utilities of the players are highly concentrated around their expectation, and
are bounded below by some threshold based on the parameters of the network.
Finally, we obtain a lower bound for the maximum social welfare of the game

agents? The golden standard typically is the behavior of learning dynamics in
potential games, where many evolutionary dynamics, e.g., replicator, are known
to converge to sets of equilibria. Even in such classic settings many critical
questions remain unanswered. We examine issues such as:
  Point-wise convergence: Does the system actually equilibrate even in the
presence of continuums of equilibria?
  Computing regions of attraction: Given point-wise convergence can we compute
the region of asymptotic stability of each equilibrium (e.g., estimate its
volume, geometry)?
  System invariants: Invariant functions remain constant along every system
trajectory. This notion is orthogonal to the game theoretic concept of a
potential function, which always strictly increases/decreases along system
trajectories. Do dynamics in potential games exhibit invariant functions? If
so, how many? How do these functions look like?
  Based on these geometric characterizations, we propose a novel quantitative
framework for analyzing the efficiency of potential games with many equilibria.
The predictions of different equilibria are weighted by their probability to
arise under evolutionary dynamics given uniformly random initial conditions.
This average case analysis is shown to offer novel insights in classic game
theoretic challenges, including quantifying the risk dominance in stag-hunt
games and allowing for more nuanced performance analysis in networked
coordination and congestion games with large gaps between price of stability
and price of anarchy.

increase. After 24 h of incubation large MNP-protein aggregates with
hydrodynamic sizes 1500 to 3000 nm (PAA-MNPs and PEI-MNPs respectively) were
observed. Each cluster contained an estimated number of magnetic cores between
450 and 1000, indicating the formation of large aggregates with a ""plum

charge irrespective of the MNP_core charge. We demonstrated that PEI-MNPs are
incorporated in much larger amounts than the PAA-MNPs units. Quantitative
analysis showed that SH-SY5Y cells can incorporate 100 per cent of the added
PEI-MNPs up to about 100 pg per cell, whereas for PAA-MNPs the uptake was less

squeezed reservoirs is investigated in the context of matching of the
correlations contained in the entangled states to those contained in the
squeezed reservoir. We illustrate our considerations by examining the time
evolution of entanglement of single and double excitation NOON and EPR states.
A comparison is made when each cavity is coupled to own reservoir or both
cavities are coupled to a common reservoir. It is shown that the evolution of
the initial entanglement and transfer of entanglement from the squeezed
reservoir to the cavity modes depend crucially on the matching of the initial
correlations to that contained in the squeezed reservoir. In particular, it is
found that initially entangled modes with correlations different from the
reservoir correlations prevent the transfer of the correlations from the
squeezed field to the modes. In addition, we find that the transient
entanglement exhibits several features unique to quantum nature of squeezing.
In particular, we show that in the case of separate squeezed reservoirs a
variation of the decay time of the initial entanglement with the squeezing
phase is unique to quantum squeezing. In the case of a common reservoir a
recurrence of entanglement occurs and we find that this feature also results
from the reservoir correlations unique to quantum squeezing. There is no
revival of entanglement when the modes interact with a classically squeezed
field.

begun to form a thick dust layer that caused a peak extinction of Delta(V)>5

Yukawa couplings between the messenger fields and Higgs fields, we find that
this mechanism can predict a neutralino dark matter with correct relic density

common features. Firstly, the Higgs sector falls into the decoupling limit. So
the properties of the light Higgs boson are similar to the predictions of the
Standard Model one. Secondly, the correct EWSB hints a relatively small
$\mu$-term, which makes the lightest neutralino lighter than the lightest stau.
So a bino-higgsino dark matter with correct relic density can be achieved. And
the relatively small $\mu$-term results in a small fine-tuning. Finally, this
bino-higgsino dark matter can pass all current bounds, including both
spin-independent and spin-dependent direct searches. The spin-independent cross
section of our points can be examined by further experiments.

efficiently estimate the graph properties by consulting a sample of the whole
population. A perfect sample is assumed to mirror every property of the whole
population. Unfortunately, such a perfect sample is hard to collect in complex
populations such as graphs (e.g. web graphs, social networks etc), where an
underlying network connects the units of the population. Therefore, a good
sample will be representative in the sense that graph properties of interest
can be estimated with a known degree of accuracy. While previous work focused
particularly on sampling schemes used to estimate certain graph properties
(e.g. triangle count), much less is known for the case when we need to estimate
various graph properties with the same sampling scheme. In this paper, we
propose a generic stream sampling framework for big-graph analytics, called
Graph Sample and Hold (gSH). To begin, the proposed framework samples from
massive graphs sequentially in a single pass, one edge at a time, while
maintaining a small state. We then show how to produce unbiased estimators for
various graph properties from the sample. Given that the graph analysis
algorithms will run on a sample instead of the whole population, the runtime
complexity of these algorithm is kept under control. Moreover, given that the
estimators of graph properties are unbiased, the approximation error is kept
under control. Finally, we show the performance of the proposed framework (gSH)
on various types of graphs, such as social graphs, among others.

variation. The objective of the work is to generalize this model to the
conditions of the deep layer of a clayey vadose zone with the overburden
pressure, multiple shrinkage-swelling, and variation of water content in a
small range. We aim to show that the scanning shrinkage and swelling curves,
and steady shrink-swell cycles existing in such conditions, inevitably lead to
the occurrence of cracks and a hysteretic crack volume. The generalization is
based on the transition to the increasingly complex soil medium from the
contributive clay, through the intra-aggregate matrix and aggregated soil with
no cracking, to the soil with cracks. The results indicate the single-valued
physical links between the scanning shrink-swell cycles and crack volume
variation of the four soil media on the one hand, and primary shrinkage and
swelling curves of the media on the other hand. The predicted cycles and crack
volume hysteresis can be expressed through the physical properties and
conditions of the soil at a given depth. The available observations of the

real molecules on the wall surface is calculated using the molecular variables
rather than the cell's macroscopic variables, is proposed to eliminate the
unphysical density drift, which was observed in the previous DSBGK simulation
of the lid-driven problem but disappears in the channel flow problem because of
the density constraint imposed at the open boundaries. Consequently, the
efficient time-average process is valid for sampling all quantities of interest
in closed as well as open problems. When the driven velocity of the lid-driven
problem is only one micrometer per second that is realistic in the
micro-electro-mechanical systems or pore-scale flows of the shale gas, we
suggest to use the original boundary condition because the density drift during
a very long time interval becomes unperceivable when the perturbation is tiny.
Thus, the original diffuse boundary condition, which contains much less
stochastic noise than the improved one, is still an advisable choice in closed
problems with tiny perturbation and in open problems unless the density drift
occurs and fails the goal of the simulations making the use of the improved
boundary condition necessary.

Using standard asymptotic analysis we prove that, on bounded domains, auxin
peaks are not formed via a Turing instability in the active transport
parameter, but via simple corrections to the homogeneous steady state. When the
active transport is small, the geometry of the tissue encodes the peaks'
amplitude and location: peaks arise where cells have fewer neighbours, that is,
at the boundary of the domain. We test our theory and perform numerical
bifurcation analysis on two models which are known to generate auxin patterns
for biologically plausible parameter values. In the same parameter regimes, we
find that realistic tissues are capable of generating a multitude of stationary
patterns, with a variable number of auxin peaks, that can be selected by
different initial conditions or by quasi-static changes in the active transport
parameter. The competition between active transport and production rate
determines whether peaks remain localised or cover the entire domain. We relate
the occurrence of localised patterns to a snaking bifurcation structure, which
is known to arise in a wide variety of nonlinear media but has not yet been
reported in plant models.

Engineering system development in practice. But one should be able to test its
characteristics by means of a no less generic theory matching the SEMAT kernel.
This paper claims that such a matching theory is attainable and describes its
main principles. The conceptual starting point is the robustness of the Kernel
alphas to variations in the nature of the software system, viz. to software
automation, distribution and self-evolution. From these and from observed
Kernel properties follows the proposed bootstrap principle: a software system
theory should itself be a runnable software. Thus, the kernel alphas can be
viewed as a top-level ontology, indeed the Essence of Software Engineering.
Among the interesting consequences of this bootstrap theory, the observable
system characteristics can now be formally tested. For instance, one can check
the system completeness, viz. that software system modules fulfill each one of
the system requirements.

specific $L^2$ metaplectic functions and for understanding these conjectures:
descent integrals. We study descent integrals which begin with theta functions
on covers of larger rank classical groups and use them to construct certain
$L^2$ metaplectic functions on covers related to $GL_2$. We then establish
information about the Fourier coefficients of these metaplectic automorphic
functions, properties which are consistent with the conjectures of Patterson
and Chinta-Friedberg-Hoffstein. In particular, we prove that Fourier
coefficients of the descent functions are arithmetic for infinitely many primes
$p$. We also show that they generate a representation with non-zero projection
to the space of theta. We conjecture that the descents may be used to realize
the quartic and sextic theta functions. Moreover, this framework suggests that
each of the conjectures of Patterson and Chinta-Friedberg-Hoffstein is the
first in a series of relations between certain Fourier coefficients of two

information in regulatory systems since their successful social organization is
essentially achieved by effective information transfer through complex
connectivity patterns among the colony members. Network representation of such
behavioural interactions offers a powerful tool for structural as well as
dynamical analysis of the underlying regulatory systems. In this paper, we
focus on the dominance interaction networks in the tropical social wasp
\textit{Ropalidia marginata} - a species where behavioural observations
indicate that such interactions are principally responsible for the transfer of
information between individuals about their colony needs, resulting in a
regulation of their own activities. Our research reveals that the dominance
networks of \textit{R. marginata} are structurally similar to a class of
naturally evolved information processing networks, a fact confirmed also by the
predominance of a specific substructure - the `feed-forward loop' - a key
functional component in many other information transfer networks. The dynamical
analysis through Boolean modeling confirms that the networks are sufficiently
stable under small fluctuations and yet capable of more efficient information
transfer compared to their randomized counterparts. Our results suggest the
involvement of a common structural design principle in different biological
regulatory systems and a possible similarity with respect to the effect of
selection on the organization levels of such systems. The findings are also
consistent with the hypothesis that dominance behaviour has been shaped by
natural selection to co-opt the information transfer process in such social
insect species, in addition to its primal function of mediation of reproductive
competition in the colony.
