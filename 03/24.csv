characterize the state and use it in quantum information, but also in
understanding complicated phenomena such as phase transitions. In this paper we
show that in many cases, it is possible to determine entanglement of a two
qubit state, as represented by concurrence, with a few observables, most of
which are local. In particular, rank 1 and rank 2 states need exclusively
measurement of local observables while rank 3 states need measurement of just
one correlation observable in addition to local observables. Only the rank 4
states are shown to require a more detailed tomography. The analysis also sheds
light on the other measure, non separability since it is a lower bound on
concurrence.

for a single advertiser, who invests at multiple sponsored search sites
simultaneously, with the objective of maximizing his average revenue subject to
the advertising budget constraint. A greedy online investment scheme is
developed to achieve an average revenue that can be pushed to within
$O(\epsilon)$ of the optimal, for any $\epsilon>0$, with a tradeoff that the
temporal budget violation is $O(1/\epsilon)$. Different from many existing
algorithms, our scheme allows the advertiser to \emph{asynchronously} update
his investments on each search engine site, hence applies to systems where the
timescales of action update intervals are heterogeneous for different sites. We
also quantify the impact of inaccurate estimation of the system dynamics and
show that the algorithm is robust against imperfect system knowledge.

higher than previous algorithms and is linked to the #clicks_i, the small

change in the result but in case of fraudulent clicks the number of clicks
increases or decreases rapidly which will add up with the normal clicks to
increase the denominator, thereby decreasing the CTR.

matter using a semi-classical nucleon interaction model. We show that, at
sub-saturation densities and low temperatures, the solutions are
non-homogeneous structures reminiscent of the ``nuclear pasta'' phases expected
in Neutron Star Matter simulations, but shaped by artificial aspects of the
simulations. We explore different geometries for the periodic boundary
conditions imposed on the simulation cell: cube, hexagonal prism and truncated
octahedron. We find that different cells may yield different solutions for the
same physical conditions (i.e. density and temperature). The particular shape
of the solution at a given density can be predicted analytically by energy
minimization. We also show that even if this behavior is due to finite size
effects, it does not mean that it vanishes for very large systems and it
actually is independent of the system size: The system size sets the only
characteristic length scale for the inhomogeneities.
  We then include a screened Coulomb interaction, as a model of Neutron Star
Matter, and perform simulations in the three cell geometries. In this case, the
competition between competing interactions of different range produces the well
known nuclear pasta, with (in most cases) several structures per cell. However,
we find that the results are affected by finite size in different ways
depending on the geometry of the cell. In particular, at the same physical
conditions and system size, the hexagonal prism yields a single structure per
cell while the cubic and truncated octahedron show consistent results with more
than one structure per cell. In this case, the results in every cell are
expected to converge for systems much larger than the characteristic length
scale that arises from the competing interactions.

to an anisotropic phase-fluctuation action that describes elliptic vortices and
antivortices, which become circular in the RO limit. This deformation
constitutes an important experimental signature for superfluidity in a 2D Fermi

to reach a stable state regardless of how the system is initialized. Game
dynamics are uncoupled if each player's behavior is independent of the other

distributed computational task. Self-stabilizing uncoupled dynamics, then, have
both resilience to arbitrary initial states and distribution of knowledge. We
study these dynamics by analyzing their behavior in a bounded-recall
synchronous environment. We determine, for every ""size"" of game, the minimum
number of periods of play that stochastic (randomized) players must recall in
order for uncoupled dynamics to be self-stabilizing. We also do this for the
special case when the game is guaranteed to have unique best replies. For
deterministic players, we demonstrate two self-stabilizing uncoupled protocols.
One applies to all games and uses three steps of recall. The other uses two
steps of recall and applies to games where each player has at least four
available actions. For uncoupled deterministic players, we prove that a single
step of recall is insufficient to achieve self-stabilization, regardless of the

surrounded by a nuclear cluster and a clumpy torus of gas and dust. Mutual
interactions can set some stars on a plunging trajectory towards the black
hole. We model the pericentre passage of a dust-enshrouded star during which
the dusty envelope becomes stretched by tidal forces and is affected by the
interaction with the surrounding medium. In particular, we explore under which
conditions these encounters can lead to periods of enhanced accretion activity.
We discuss different scenarios for such a dusty source. To this end, we
employed a modification of the Swift integration package. Elements of the cloud
were modelled as numerical particles that represent the dust component that
interacts with the optically thin gaseous environment. We determine the
fraction of the total mass of the dust component that is diverted from the
original path during the passages through the pericentre at $\sim 10^3$
Schwarzschild radii and find that the main part of the dust ($\gtrsim 90\%$ of
its mass) is significantly affected upon the first crossing. The fraction of
mass captured at the second passage generally decreases to very low values. As
an example, we show predictions for the dusty source evolution assuming the
current orbital parameters of the G2 cloud (also known as Dusty S-Cluster
Object, DSO) in our Galactic centre. Encounter of a core-less cloud with a
supermassive black hole is, most likely, a non-repeating event: the cloud is
destroyed. However, in the case of a dust-enshrouded star, part of the envelope
survives the pericentre passage. We discuss an offset of $\lesssim 0.3$ arcsec
between the centre of mass of the diverted part and the star along the
eccentric orbit. Finally, we examine an interesting possibility of a binary
star embedded within a common wind envelope that becomes dispersed at the
pericentre passage.

at 24 micron were also found to derive from the immediate vicinity of younger,
hot WDs, most of which are still central stars of planetary nebulae (CSPN). The
incidence of CSPN with this excess is 18%. The Helix CSPN, with a 24 micron
excess, has been suggested to have a disk formed from collisions of Kuiper
belt-like objects (KBOs). In this paper, we have analyzed an additional sample
of CSPN to look for similar infrared excesses. These CSPN are all members of
the PG 1159 class and were chosen because their immediate progenitors are known
to often have dusty environments consistent with large dusty disks. We find
that, overall, PG 1159 stars do not present such disks more often than other
CSPN, although the statistics (5 objects) are poor. We then consider the entire
sample of CSPN with infrared excesses, and compare it to the infrared
properties of old WDs, as well as cooler post-AGB stars. We conclude with the
suggestion that the infrared properties of CSPN more plausibly derive from
AGB-formed disks rather than disks formed via the collision of KBOs, although
the latter scenario cannot be ruled out. We finally remark that there seems to
be an association between CSPN with a 24 micron excess and confirmed or
possible binarity of the central star.

optical emission knots. The X-ray emitting component is sometimes linked to
optical clumps through shock induced mass ablation generating trailing material
leading to spatially offset X-ray/optical emissions. A range of ejecta
densities can also explain the observed X-ray/optical time delays since the
remnant's 5000 km/s reverse shock heats dense ejecta clumps to temperatures
around 3x10^4 K relatively quickly which then become optically bright while
more diffuse ejecta become X-ray bright on longer timescales. Highly
inhomogeneous ejecta as proposed here for Cas A may help explain some of the
X-ray/opticalfeatures seen in other young core collapse SN remnants.

This gives rise to two notions of biequidimensionality, and we show how these

trying to reproduce the relation between the SMBH mass and stellar velocity
dispersion of the galaxy bulge make broad assumptions about the physical
processes involved. These assumptions are needed due to the scarcity of
observational constraints on the relevant physical processes which occur when
the SMBH is being fed via mass accretion in Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN). In
search for these constraints, our group -- AGN Integral Field Spectroscopy
(AGNIFS) -- has been mapping the gas kinematics as well as the stellar
population properties of the inner few hundred parsecs of a sample of nearby
AGN hosts. In this contribution, I report results obtained so far which show
gas inflows along nuclear spirals and compact disks in the inner tens to
hundreds of pc in nearby AGN hosts which seem to be the sources of fuel to the
AGN. As the inflow rates are much larger than the AGN accretion rate, the
excess gas must be depleted via formation of new stars in the bulge. Indeed, in
many cases, we find ~100 pc circumnuclear rings of recent star formation (ages
~ 10 - 500 Myr) that can be interpreted as a signature of co-evolution of the
host galaxy and its AGN.

links in a wireless sensor network. Our application of interest is one in which
a number of low-powered sensors need to wirelessly communicate their
measurements to a communications sink, or destination node, for communication
to a central processor. We focus on one particular sensor source, and consider
the case where the distance to the destination is beyond the peak power of the
source. A relay node is required. Transmission energy of the sensor and the
relay can be adjusted to minimize the total energy for a given throughput of
the connection from sensor source to destination. We introduce a bounded random
walk model for movement of the relay between the sensor and destination nodes,
and characterize the total transmission energy and throughput performance using
Markov steady state analysis. Based on the trade-offs between total energy and
throughput we propose a new time-sharing protocol to exploit the movement of
the relay to reduce the total energy. We demonstrate the effectiveness of
time-sharing for minimizing the total energy consumption while achieving the
throughput requirement. We then show that the time-sharing scheme is more
energy efficient than the popular sleep mode scheme.

propose a spherical two-electron gedanken density in which the dimensionless

exchange-energy density is not an approximation to it. We further derive a
strongly and optimally tightened bound on the exchange enhancement factor of a
two-electron density, which is satisfied by the local density approximation but
is violated by all published GGA's or meta-GGA's. Finally, some consequences of

Stars in a cluster are thought to be formed coevally from the same interstellar
cloud of gas and dust. They are therefore expected to have common properties.
These common properties strengthen our ability to constrain theoretical models
and/or to determine fundamental parameters, such as stellar mass, metal
fraction, and distance when tested against an ensemble of cluster stars. Here
we derive a new relation based on solar-like oscillations, photometric
observations, and the theory of stellar structure and evolution of red giant
branch stars to determine cluster distance moduli through the global
oscillation parameters $\Delta\nu$ and $\nu_{\rm max}$, and photometric data
\textit{V}. The values of $\Delta\nu$ and $\nu_{\rm max}$ are derived from
\textit{kepler} observations. At the same time, it is used to interpret the
trends between \textit{V} and $\Delta\nu$. From the analyses of this newly
derived relation and observational data of NGC 6791 and NGC 6819 we devise a
method in which all stars in a cluster are regarded as one entity to determine
the cluster distance modulus. This approach fully reflects the characteristic
of member stars in a cluster as a natural sample. From this method we derive
true distance moduli of $13.09\pm0.10$ mag for NGC 6791 and $11.88\pm0.14$ mag
for NGC 6819. Additionally, we find that the distance modulus only slightly
depends on the metallicity [Fe/H] in the new relation. A change of 0.1 dex in
[Fe/H] will lead to a change of 0.06 mag in the distance modulus.

magnitude higher than the mass of any moon in the solar system. I here present
a new method sensitive to exomoons similar to the known moons. Due to the
projection of transiting exomoon orbits onto the celestial plane, satellites
appear more often at larger separations from their planet. After about a dozen
randomly sampled observations, a photometric orbital sampling effect (OSE)
starts to appear in the phase-folded transit light curve, indicative of the
moons' radii and planetary distances. Two additional outcomes of the OSE emerge
in the planet's transit timing variations (TTV-OSE) and transit duration
variations (TDV-OSE), both of which permit measurements of a moon's mass. The
OSE is the first effect that permits characterization of multi-satellite
systems. I derive and apply analytical OSE descriptions to simulated transit
observations of the Kepler space telescope assuming white noise only. Moons as
small as Ganymede may be detectable in the available data, with M stars being
their most promising hosts. Exomoons with the 10-fold mass of Ganymede and a
similar composition (about 0.86 Earth radii in radius) can most likely be found
in the available Kepler data of K stars, including moons in the stellar
habitable zone. A future survey with Kepler-class photometry, such as Plato

A
common feature of such networks is that they consist of several communities or
modules, the degree of which may quantified as the \emph{modularity}. However,
even a random uncorrelated network, which has no obvious modular structure, has
a finite modularity due to the quenched disorder. For this reason, the
modularity of a given network is meaningful only when it is compared with that
of a randomized network with the same degree distribution. In this context, it
is important to calculate the modularity of a random uncorrelated network with
an arbitrary degree distribution. The modularity of a random network has been
calculated [Phys. Rev. E \textbf{76}, 015102 (2007)]; however, this was limited
to the case whereby the network was assumed to have only two communities, and
it is evident that the modularity should be calculated in general with $q(\geq
2)$ communities. Here, we calculate the modularity for $q$ communities by
evaluating the ground state energy of the $q$-state Potts Hamiltonian, based on
replica symmetric solutions assuming that the mean degree is large. We found
that the modularity is proportional to $\langle \sqrt{k} \rangle / \langle k
\rangle$ regardless of $q$ and that only the coefficient depends on $q$. In
particular, when the degree distribution follows a power law, the modularity is
proportional to $\langle k \rangle^{-1/2}$. Our analytical results are
confirmed by comparison with numerical simulations. Therefore, our results can
be used as reference values for real-world networks.

that the flattened envelope is infalling with small rotation (i.e., spiraling)
into the central source, and thus can be identified as a pseudodisk in the
models of magnetized core collapse. Also, the HCO+ kinematics shows that the
disk is rotating and can be rotationally supported. In addition, to account for
the missing HCO+ emission at low-redshifted velocity, an extended infalling
envelope is required, with its material flowing roughly parallel to the jet

hourglass B-field morphology. We have modeled the continuum and HCO+ emission

jet is seen in HCO+ extending out to ~ 500 AU away from the central source,

quadratic transportation cost inequality. Further examples of illustrations
include multidimensional gamma distributions, beta distributions, as well as
families of log-concave densities. As a by-product, the new inequalities are
shown to be relevant towards convergence to equilibrium, concentration
inequalities and entropic convergence expressed in terms of the Stein kernel.
The tools rely on semigroup interpolation and bounds, in particular by means of
the iterated gradients of the Markov generator with invariant measure the
distribution under consideration. In a second part, motivated by the recent
investigation by Nourdin, Peccati and Swan on Wiener chaoses, we address the
issue of entropic bounds on multidimensional functionals $F$ with the Stein
kernel via a set of data on $F$ and its gradients rather than on the Fisher
information of the density. A natural framework for this investigation is given
by the Markov Triple structure $(E, \mu, \Gamma)$ in which abstract
Malliavin-type arguments may be developed and extend the Wiener chaos setting.

individual behavior and mass effect are interrelated via their state-average.
The mean-field game provides an efficient way to get the decentralized
strategies of large-population system when studying its dynamic optimizations.
Unlike other large-population literature, this current paper possesses the
following distinctive features. First, our setting includes the partial
information structure of large-population system which is practical from real
application standpoint. Specially, two cases of partial information structure
are considered here: the partial filtration case (see Section 2, 3) where the
available information to agents is the filtration generated by an observable
component of underlying Brownian motion; the noisy observation case (Section 4)
where the individual agent can access an additive white-noise observation on
its own state. Also, it is new in filtering modeling that our sensor function
may depend on the state-average. Second, in both cases, the limiting
state-averages become random and the filtering equations to individual state
should be formalized to get the decentralized strategies. Moreover, it is also
new that the limit average of state filters should be analyzed here. This makes
our analysis very different to the full information arguments of
large-population system. Third, the consistency conditions are equivalent to
the wellposedness of some Riccati equations, and do not involve the fixed-point
analysis as in other mean-field games. The $\epsilon$-Nash equilibrium
properties are also presented.

Existing approaches to identify urban areas normally based on mid-resolution

associate with low-resolution in space, e.g. cells with several square
kilometers or even larger towns/wards. Yet, few of them pay attention to
defining urban areas with micro data in a fine-scaled manner with large extend
scale by incorporating the morphological and functional characteristics. This
paper investigates an automated framework to delineate urban areas in the
parcel level, using increasingly available ordnance surveys for generating all
parcels (or geo-units) and ubiquitous points of interest (POIs) for inferring
density of each parcel. A vector cellular automata model was adopted for
identifying urban parcels from all generated parcels, taking into account
density, neighborhood condition, and other spatial variables of each parcel. We
applied this approach for mapping urban areas of all 654 Chinese cities and
compared them with those interpreted from mid-resolution remote sensing images
and inferred by population density and road intersections. Our proposed
framework is proved to be more straight-forward, time-saving and fine-scaled,
compared with other existing ones, and reclaim the need for consistency,
efficiency and availability in defining urban areas with well-consideration of
omnipresent spatial and functional factors across cities.

of forces driving cell shape changes and in determining the effective material
properties of cells and tissues. Drosophila dorsal closure (DC) has emerged as
a model system for studying the interplay between tissue mechanics and cellular
activity. Thereby, the amnioserosa (AS) generates one of the major forces that
drive DC through the apical contraction of its constituent cells. We combined
quantitation of live data, genetic and mechanical perturbation and cell
biology, to investigate how mechanical properties and contraction rate emerge
from cytoskeletal activity. We found that a decrease in Myosin phosphorylation
induces a fluidization of AS cells which become more compliant. Conversely, an
increase in Myosin phosphorylation and an increase in actin linear
polymerization induce a solidification of cells. Contrary to expectation, these
two perturbations have an opposite effect on the strain rate of cells during
DC. While an increase in actin polymerization increases the contraction rate of
AS cells, an increase in Myosin phosphorylation gives rise to cells that
contract very slowly. The quantification of how the perturbation induced by
laser ablation decays throughout the tissue revealed that the tissue in these
two mutant backgrounds reacts very differently. We suggest that the differences
in the strain rate of cells in situations where Myosin activity or actin
polymerization is increased arise from changes in how the contractile forces
are transmitted and coordinated across the tissue through ECadherin mediated
adhesion. Our results show that there is an optimal level of Myosin activity to
generate efficient contraction and suggest that the architecture of the actin
cytoskeleton and the dynamics of adhesion complexes are important parameters
for the emergence of coordinated activity throughout the tissue.

correspond to thermal ones. In particular, $S(\bq)$ does develop an analytical

non-analyticity corresponds to persisting power-law decaying density-density
correlations, whereas thermalization would predict only an exponential decay.
We next consider the case of a dilute gas, where one can obtain
non-perturbative results in the interaction strength but at lowest order in the
density. We find that in the steady-state the momentum distribution jump at the

we observe slow stochastic switching between two opposite magnetisation states,

with the field frequency and the interaction strengths reach the ultra-strong

of the spectra can be determined exactly in the homogeneous coupling case with
two identical qubits or with symmetric(asymmetric) detuning. By means of the

scales larger than the structural scale which significantly influence both the
crystallization kinetics and the final micro-structure. By careful analysis of
the SALS signal evolution and by comparing different suggestions for small
angle signal shapes to our data we can for most cases identify the processes
leading to the observed signals. These include phase contrast form factor
scattering from depletion zones during formation and overlap as well as during
gelation, amplitude contrast form factor scattering by more transparent
crystals, and structure factor scattering from late stage inter-crystallite
ordering. The large variety of different small angle signals thus in principle
contains valuable information complementary to that gained from Bragg
scattering or microscopy. Our comparison, however, also shows that further
refinement and adaptation of the theoretical expressions to the sample specific
boundary conditions is desired for a quantitative kinetic analysis of
micro-structural evolution.

very general forms of multipath, including interference with three or more

outline some basic steps to extend this theory to stochastic partial

scaling laws for linear SPDEs and comparing the results to numerical
simulations of fully nonlinear problems. In particular, we study stochastic

scaling law of the covariance operator in a regime where linearization is
expected to be a good approximation for the local fluctuations around
deterministic steady states. We compare these results to direct numerical
simulation, and study the influence of noise level, noise color, distance to
bifurcation and domain size on early-warning signs.

calculated at the generic value of the energy $E$ and separately at the

around TN J1338-1942, a powerful radio galaxy with a >100 kpc Ly$\alpha$ halo
at z=4.11. We used a sample of Ly$\alpha$ emitters (LAEs) down to $\log(L_{\rm
Ly\alpha} [erg\, s^{-1}])\sim 42.8$ to measure the galaxy density around
TNJ1338, compared to a control sample from a blank field taken with the same
instrument. We found that TNJ1338 resides in a region with a peak overdensity
of $\delta_{\rm LAE}=2.8\pm 0.5$ on scales of $8\, h^{-1}\rm Mpc$ (on the sky)
and $112\, h^{-1}\rm Mpc$ (line of sight) in comoving coordinates. Adjacent to
this overdensity, we found a strong underdensity where virtually no LAEs are
detected. We used a semi-analytical model of LAEs derived from the Millennium
Simulation to compare our results with theoretical predictions. While the
theoretical density distribution is consistent with the blank field, overdense
regions such as that around TNJ1338 are very rare, with a number density of
$6.4\times 10^{-8}\rm Mpc^{-3}$ (comoving), corresponding to the densest < 0.4
percentile at $z\simeq 4.1$. We also found that the Ly$\alpha$ luminosity
function in the TNJ1338 field differs from that in the blank field: the number
of bright LAEs ($\log(L_{\rm Ly\alpha}[erg\,s^{-1}]) \gtrsim 43.3$) is
enhanced, while the number of fainter LAEs is relatively suppressed. These
results suggest that some powerful radio galaxies associated with Ly$\alpha$
nebulae reside in extreme overdensities on $\sim 3$--$6\, \rm Mpc$ scales,
where star-formation and AGN activity may be enhanced via frequent galaxy
mergers or high rates of gas accretion from the surroundings.

criteria were the integrated strength of the absorption lines in the aliphatic
stretchings wavelength band, weak IR activity in the aromatic stretching band

branched, short and oxygen-bridged CH_{2} chains, and naphtenic chains.
Combinations of their absorption spectra deliver spectra comparable to those
observed in the sky. Absorption spectra were derived from Normal Mode Analysis.
Emission spectra of the same structures were computed by monitoring their
overall dipole moment as they vibrate freely in vacuum after excitation. These

aromatic structures, so as to simulate various typical near IR emission spectra

automated vehicles are controlled to optimise a cost function, assuming other
vehicles driving at stationary conditions over a prediction horizon. The
flexibility of the framework is demonstrated with controller design of Adaptive
Cruise Control (ACC) and Cooperative ACC (C-ACC) systems. The proposed ACC and
C-ACC model characteristics are investigated analytically, with focus on
equilibrium solutions and stability properties. The proposed ACC model produces
plausible human car-following behaviour and is unconditionally locally stable.
By careful tuning of parameters, the ACC model generates similar stability
characteristics as human driver models. The proposed C-ACC model results in
convective downstream and absolute string instability, but not convective
upstream string instability observed in human-driven traffic and in the ACC
model. The control framework and analytical results provide insights into the

Banach algebra A, the intersection of the Jacobson radical of A** with A is
precisely the radical of A (this is claimed for either of the Arens products on
A** - in itself a reasonable claim, because A is always contained in the
topological centre of A**, so a fixed a in A lies in the radical of A** with
the first Arens product, if and only if it lies in the radical of A** when that
Banach space is given the second Arens product, if and only if ab is

counterexample to that claim, in which A is a radical operator algebra, but not
every element of A lies in the radical of A**. We then develope a more
complicated example A which, once again, is a radical operator algebra, but A**
is semisimple. So rad A** $\cap$ A is zero, but rad A=A. We conclude by
examining the uses Gulick's paper has been put to since 1966 (at least 8

correct material from that paper, and avoided using the wrong result. We

prove that, when considered in composite quantum systems, it defines partition

that it is not possible to define extensive thermodynamical magnitudes such as

induces a triangle-free graph. In this paper we investigate the computational
complexity of deciding whether a graph is partitionable. The problem is known
to be $\NP$-complete on arbitrary graphs. Here it is proved that if a graph $G$
is bull-free, planar, perfect, $K_4$-free or does not contain certain holes
then deciding whether $G$ is partitionable is $\NP$-complete. This answers an
open question posed by Thomass{\'e}, Trotignon and Vu\v{s}kovi{\'c}. In
contrast a finite list of forbidden induced subgraphs is given for
partitionable cographs.

  In the same way as planar binary trees can be interpreted as sylvester
classes of permutations, we obtain (m+1)-ary trees as sylvester classes of what
we call m-permutations. These objects are no longer in bijection with
decreasing (m+1)-ary trees, and a finer congruence, called metasylvester,
allows us to build Hopf algebras based on these decreasing trees. At the
opposite, a coarser congruence, called hyposylvester, leads to Hopf algebras of
graded dimensions (m+1)^{n-1}, generalizing noncommutative symmetric functions
and quasi-symmetric functions in a natural way. Finally, the algebras of packed
words and parking functions also admit such m-analogues, and we present their
subalgebras and quotients induced by the various congruences.

involves redundancy in data representation. Mathematically this may be achieved
by redundancy through the use of frames. One way to measure the robustness of a
frame against erasures is to examine the worst case condition number of the
frame with a certain number of vectors erased from the frame. The term {\em
numerically erasure-robust frames (NERFs)} was introduced in \cite{FicMix12} to
give a more precise characterization of erasure robustness of frames. In the
paper the authors established that random frames whose entries are drawn
independently from the standard normal distribution can be robust against up to
approximately 15\% erasures, and asked whether there exist frames that are
robust against erasures of more than 50\%. In this paper we show that with very
high probability random frames are, independent of the dimension, robust
against any amount of erasures as long as the number of remaining vectors is at
least $1+\delta$ times the dimension for some $\delta_0>0$. This is the best
possible result, and it also implies that the proportion of erasures can
arbitrarily close to 1 while still maintaining robustness. Our result depends
crucially on a new estimate for the smallest singular value of a rectangular
random matrix with independent standard normal entries.

Projection-based methods are powerful tools, but the cost of their use is the
loss of physical interpretation of the nodes in the network. In order alleviate
this drawback, we employ structured projectors, which means that some nodes in
the network will keep their physical interpretation. For many models in
engineering, finding structured projectors is not always feasible; however, in
the context of biochemical networks it is much more likely as the networks are
often (almost) monotonic. To summarise, the method can serve as a trade-off
between approximation quality and physical interpretation, which is illustrated
on numerical examples.

complex conjugation C and time-reversal T, but we identify also other
significant symmetries. Borrowing the jargon of the classification theory of
topological insulators, we show that C is a particle-hole-type symmetry rather
than a time-reversal symmetry if one consider the Maxwell operator in the
first-order formalism where the dynamical Maxwell equations can be rewritten as
a Schr\""odinger equation; The symmetry which implements physical time-reversal
is a chiral-type symmetry. We justify by an analysis of the band structure why
the first-order formalism seems to be more advantageous than the second-order
formalism. Moreover, based on the Schr\""odinger formalism, we introduce a class
of effective (tight-binding) models called Maxwell-Harper operators. Some
considerations about the breaking of the particle-hole-type symmetry in the
case of gyrotropic crystals are added at the end of this paper.

unknown parameters in a sequential data assimilation framework. The state
augmentation technique, in which the state vector is augmented by the model
parameters, has been investigated in many previous studies and some success
with this technique has been reported in the case where model parameters are
additive. However, many geophysical or climate models contains non-additive
parameters such as those arising from physical parametrization of sub-grid
scale processes, in which case the state augmentation technique may become
ineffective since its inference about parameters from partially observed states
based on the cross covariance between states and parameters is inadequate if
states and parameters are not linearly correlated. In this paper, we propose a
two-stages filtering technique that runs particle filtering (PF) to estimate
parameters while updating the state estimate using Ensemble Kalman filter
(ENKF; these two ""sub-filters"" interact. The applicability of the proposed
method is demonstrated using the Lorenz-96 system, where the forcing is
parameterized and the amplitude and phase of the forcing are to be estimated
jointly with the states. The proposed method is shown to be capable of
estimating these model parameters with a high accuracy as well as reducing
uncertainty while the state augmentation technique fails.

size information on response time and fairness. Our intent is to revisit
previous results, which allude to performance degradation for even small errors
on job size estimates, thus limiting the applicability of size-based
schedulers.
  We show that scheduling performance is tightly connected to workload
characteristics: in the absence of large skew in the job size distribution,
even extremely imprecise estimates suffice to outperform size-oblivious
disciplines. Instead, when job sizes are heavily skewed, known size-based
disciplines suffer.
  In this context, we show -- for the first time -- the dichotomy of
over-estimation versus under-estimation. The former is, in general, less
problematic than the latter, as its effects are localized to individual jobs.
Instead, under-estimation leads to severe problems that may affect a large
number of jobs.
  We present an approach to mitigate these problems: our technique requires no
complex modifications to original scheduling policies and performs very well.
To support our claim, we proceed with a simulation-based evaluation that covers
an unprecedented large parameter space, which takes into account a variety of
synthetic and real workloads.
  As a consequence, we show that size-based scheduling is practical and
outperforms alternatives in a wide array of use-cases, even in presence of

technique transiently perturbs the profiles, driving the density profile hollow
and flattening the edge temperature profile. After the pellet perturbation, the
density and temperature profiles relax towards their quasi-steady-state shape.
Microinstabilities influence plasma confinement and will play a role in
determining the evolution of the profiles in pellet fuelled plasmas. In this
paper we present the microstability analysis of pellet fuelled H-mode MAST
plasmas. Taking advantage of the unique capabilities of the MAST Thomson
scattering system and the possibility of synchronizing the eight lasers with
the pellet injection, we were able to measure the evolution of the post-pellet
electron density and temperature profiles with high temporal and spatial
resolution. These profiles, together with ion temperature profiles measured
using a charge exchange diagnostic, were used to produce equilibria suitable
for microstability analysis of the equilibrium changes induced by pellet
injection. This analysis, carried out using the local gyrokinetic code GS2,
reveals that the microstability properties are extremely sensitive to the rapid
and large transient excursions of the density and temperature profiles, which
also change collisionality and beta e significantly in the region most strongly
affected by the pellet ablation.

various experimentally observed regimes of the nanomotor dynamic orientation
and propulsion and establish the dependence of these properties on polarization
and geometry of the propellers. Based on the proposed theory we introduce a
novel ""steerability"" parameter $\gamma$ that can be used to rank polarizable
nanomotors by their propulsive capability. The theoretical predictions of the
nanomotor orientation and propulsion speed are in excellent agreement with
available experimental results. Lastly, we apply slender-body approximation to
estimate polarization anisotropy and orientation of the easy-axis of
superparamagnetic helical propellers.

$\lambda_{ab}$ of Ba(Fe$_{1-x}$Ni$_x$)$_2$As$_2$ single crystals is determined
directly from the shielding magnetic susceptibility, measured in the Meissner
region with the field parallel to the ab layers. The doping levels studied
cover the underdoped, optimally-doped and overdoped regimes. At temperatures
below 0.5Tc a well-defined power-law behavior
$\lambda_{ab}(T)-\lambda_{ab}(0)=AT^n$ (with n approximately 2.5) is observed.
At lower temperatures (T<0.3Tc) the data are still consistent with n=2 and
$A\propto T_c^{-3}$, as predicted by the strong pair-breaking scenario proposed
by Gordon et al., Phys. Rev. B 81, 180501(R) (2010). The temperature dependence
of the superfluid density $\rho_s\propto\lambda_{ab}^{-2}$ presents a marked
positive curvature just below Tc which is a sign of two-gap superconductivity.
The analysis of $\rho_s(T)$ in terms of a two-gap model allowed to estimate
parameters like the in-band and inter-band couplings, the relative weight of
each band, and their dependence with the doping level. A comparison with
$\rho_s(T)$ data obtained by using other techniques in compounds with a similar

physical evolution. The physical components of such systems introduce safety
requirements, the achievement of which asks for the correct monitoring and
control from the discrete controllers. However, due to denial-of-service
security attack, the expected information from the controllers is not received

paper proposes a formal framework for expressing denial-of-service security
attack in hybrid systems. As a virtue, a physical system is able to plan for
reasonable behavior in case the ideal control fails due to unreliable
communication, in such a way that the safety of the system upon
denial-of-service is still guaranteed. In the context of the modeling language,
we develop an inference system for verifying safety of hybrid systems, without
putting any assumptions on how the environments behave. Based on the inference
system, we implement an interactive theorem prover and have applied it to check
an example taken from train control system.

  crypto-currencies","5 pages, 5 figures",,,,"physics.soc-ph cs.CY q-fin.GN","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Bitcoins have emerged as a possible competitor to usual currencies, but other
crypto-currencies have likewise appeared as competitors to the Bitcoin
currency. The expanding market of crypto-currencies now involves capital
equivalent to $10^{10}$ US Dollars, providing academia with an unusual
opportunity to study the emergence of value. Here we show that the Bitcoin
currency in itself is not special, but may rather be understood as the
contemporary dominating crypto-currency that may well be replaced by other
currencies. We suggest that perception of value in a social system is generated
by a voter-like dynamics, where fashions form and disperse even in the case
where information is only exchanged on a pairwise basis between agents.

antiferromagnets are theoretically studied using the non-equilibrium Green's
function method implemented on a tight-binding model. We focus our attention on
G-type and L-type antiferromagnets in both clean and disordered regimes. In
such structures, spin torques can either rotate the magnetic order parameter
coherently (coherent torque) or compete with the internal antiferromagnetic
exchange (exchange torque). We show that, depending on the symmetry of the
spin-valve, the coherent and exchange torques can be either in the plane,
{\alpha} n\times(q \times n) or out of the plane {\alpha} n \times q, where q
and n are the directions of the order parameter of the polarizer and the free
antiferromagnetic layers, respectively. Although disorder conserves the
symmetry of the torques, it strongly reduces the torque magnitude, pointing out
the need for momentum conservation to ensure strong spin torque in
antiferromagnetic spin-valves

  score fusion",,"10.1109/TBME.2014.2317881",,"q-bio.NC stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The use of EEG biometrics, for the purpose of automatic people recognition,
has received increasing attention in the recent years. Most of current analysis
rely on the extraction of features characterizing the activity of single brain
regions, like power-spectrum estimates, thus neglecting possible temporal
dependencies between the generated EEG signals. However, important
physiological information can be extracted from the way different brain regions
are functionally coupled. In this study, we propose a novel approach that fuses
spectral coherencebased connectivity between different brain regions as a
possibly viable biometric feature. The proposed approach is tested on a large
dataset of subjects (N=108) during eyes-closed (EC) and eyes-open (EO) resting
state conditions. The obtained recognition performances show that using brain
connectivity leads to higher distinctiveness with respect to power-spectrum
measurements, in both the experimental conditions. Notably, a 100% recognition
accuracy is obtained in EC and EO when integrating functional connectivity
between regions in the frontal lobe, while a lower 97.41% is obtained in EC
(96.26% in EO) when fusing power spectrum information from centro-parietal
regions. Taken together, these results suggest that functional connectivity
patterns represent effective features for improving EEG-based biometric
systems.

  Decompositions",,,,,"cs.SC","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/publicdomain/","  In this paper we introduce the notion of an Open Non-uniform Cylindrical
Algebraic Decomposition (NuCAD), and present an efficient model-based algorithm
for constructing an Open NuCAD from an input formula. A NuCAD is a
generalization of Cylindrical Algebraic Decomposition (CAD) as defined by
Collins in his seminal work from the early 1970s, and as extended in concepts
like Hong's partial CAD. A NuCAD, like a CAD, is a decomposition of
n-dimensional real space into cylindrical cells. But unlike a CAD, the cells in
a NuCAD need not be arranged cylindrically. It is in this sense that NuCADs are
not uniformly cylindrical. However, NuCADs--- like CADs --- carry a tree-like
structure that relates different cells. It is a very different tree but, as
with the CAD tree structure, it allows some operations to be performed
efficiently, for example locating the containing cell for an arbitrary input
point.

benchmarking of several known 2D and 3D image quality metrics using the MCL-3D
database is presented in this work. Nine image-plus-depth sources are first
selected, and a depth image-based rendering (DIBR) technique is used to render
stereoscopic image pairs. Distortions applied to either the texture image or
the depth image before stereoscopic image rendering include: Gaussian blur,
additive white noise, down-sampling blur, JPEG and JPEG-2000 (JP2K) compression
and transmission error. Furthermore, the distortion caused by imperfect
rendering is also examined. The MCL-3D database contains 693 stereoscopic image
pairs, where one third of them are of resolution 1024x728 and two thirds are of
resolution 1920x1080. The pair-wise comparison was adopted in the subjective
test for user friendliness, and the Mean Opinion Score (MOS) can be computed
accordingly. Finally, we evaluate the performance of several 2D and 3D image
quality metrics applied to MCL-3D. All texture images, depth images, rendered
image pairs in MCL-3D and their MOS values obtained in the subjective test are
available to the public (http://mcl.usc.edu/mcl-3d-database/) for future
research and development.
