comprehensive analysis on the diversity order of the linear zero-forcing (ZF)
and minimum mean squared error (MMSE) transceivers. Firstly, we obtain a
compact closed-form expression for the diversity-multiplexing tradeoff (DMT)
through tight upper and lower bounds. While our DMT analysis accurately
predicts the performance of the ZF transceivers, it is observed that the MMSE
transceivers exhibit a complicated rate dependent behavior, and thus are very
unpredictable via DMT for finite rate cases. Secondly, we highlight this
interesting behavior of the MMSE transceivers and characterize the diversity
order at all finite rates. This leads to a closed-form expression for the
diversity-rate tradeoff (DRT) which reveals the relationship between the
diversity, the rate, and the number of antennas at each node. Our DRT analysis
compliments our previous work on DMT, thereby providing a complete
understanding on the diversity order of linear transceiving schemes in MIMO AF

synchronization, particularly within the framework of the Kuramoto model. The
model comprises oscillators with distributed natural frequencies interacting
through a mean-field coupling, and serves as a paradigm to study
synchronization. In this review, we put forward a general framework in which we
discuss in a unified way known results with more recent developments obtained
for a generalized Kuramoto model that includes inertial effects and noise. We
describe the model from a different perspective, highlighting the long-range
nature of the interaction between the oscillators, and emphasizing the
equilibrium and out-of-equilibrium aspects of its dynamics from a statistical
physics point of view. In the first main section, we introduce the model and
discuss for the noiseless and noisy dynamics and unimodal frequency
distributions the synchronization transition that occurs in the stationary
state. In the second section, we introduce the generalized model, and discuss
its synchronization phase diagram for unimodal frequency distributions. In the
third section, we describe deviations from the mean-field setting of the
Kuramoto model by considering the generalized dynamics on a one-dimensional
periodic lattice on the sites of which the oscillators reside and interact with
a coupling that decays as an inverse power-law of their separation. For two
specific cases, namely, in the absence of noise and inertia, and in the case
when the natural frequencies are the same for all the oscillators, we discuss
how the long-time transition to synchrony is governed by the dynamics of the
mean-field mode (zero Fourier mode) of the spatial distribution of the
oscillator phases.

included cross-phase modulation with weak classical light in atomic ensembles

independent spontaneous parametric downconversion sources. The two heralded

models under possible model misspecification when both the number of
individuals, $n$, and the number of time periods, $T$, are large. We first
clarify the probability limit of the FE estimator and argue that this
probability limit can be regarded as a pseudo-true parameter. We then establish
the asymptotic distributional properties of the FE estimator around the
pseudo-true parameter when $n$ and $T$ jointly go to infinity. Notably, we show
that the FE estimator suffers from the incidental parameters bias of which the
top order is $O(T^{-1})$, and even after the incidental parameters bias is
completely removed, the rate of convergence of the FE estimator depends on the
degree of model misspecification and is either $(nT)^{-1/2}$ or $n^{-1/2}$.
Second, we establish asymptotically valid inference on the (pseudo-true)
parameter. Specifically, we derive the asymptotic properties of the clustered
covariance matrix (CCM) estimator and the cross section bootstrap, and show
that they are robust to model misspecification. This establishes a rigorous
theoretical ground for the use of the CCM estimator and the cross section
bootstrap when model misspecification and the incidental parameters bias (in
the coefficient estimate) are present. We conduct Monte Carlo simulations to
evaluate the finite sample performance of the estimators and inference methods,
together with a simple application to the unemployment dynamics in the U.S.

$3(5+\bar{5})$ representations of SU(5) and is called the NMSSM+; while the
third model comprises $4(5+\bar{5})$ and is called the NMSSM++. Naively, one
would expect the fine tuning in the plus-type models to be smaller than that in
the NMSSM since the presence of extra matter relaxes the perturbativity bound
on $\lambda$ at the low scale. This, in turn, allows larger tree-level Higgs
mass and smaller loop contribution from the stops. However we find that LHC

indirect, but vital, role in controlling the fine tuning. In particular,
working in a semi-constrained framework at the GUT scale, we find that the
masses of third generation stops are always larger in the plus-type models than
in the NMSSM without extra matter. This is an RGE effect which cannot be
avoided, and as a consequence the fine tuning in the NMSSM+ ($\Delta \sim 200$)

adapting the classical theory of thin elastic rods. Previously established
ribbon models are extended to handle geodesic curvature, natural out-of-plane
curvature, and a variable width. Both the case of a finite width (Wunderlich's
model) and the limit of small width (Sadowksky's model) are recovered. The
ribbon is assumed to remain developable as it deforms, and the direction of the
generatrices is used as an internal variable. Internal constraints expressing
inextensibility are identified. The equilibrium of the ribbon is found to be
governed by an equation of equilibrium for the internal variable involving its
second-gradient, by the classical Kirchhoff equations for thin rods, and by
specific, thin-rod-like constitutive laws; this extends the results of
Starostin and van der Heijden (2007) to a general ribbon model. Our equations
are applicable in particular to ribbons having geodesic curvature, such as an
annulus cut out in a piece of paper. Other examples of application are
discussed. By making use of a material frame rather than the Fr\'enet-Serret's

certain patents to exert a stronger influence on the subsequent technological
developments (inventions) than other ones. We investigated six key
determinants, as (i) the use of scientific knowledge, (ii) the breadth of the
technological base, (iii) the existence of collaboration in patent development,
(iv) the number of claims, (v) the scope, and (vi) the novelty, and how the
effect of these determinants varies when patent influence - as measured by the
number of forward citations the patent received - is distinguished as within
and across the industrial and organizational boundaries. We conducted an
empirical analysis on a sample of 5671 patents granted to 293 US biotechnology
firms from 1976 to 2003. Results reveal that the contribution of the
determinants to patent influence differs across the domains that are identified
by the industrial and organizational boundaries. Findings, for example, show
that the use of scientific knowledge negatively affects patent influence
outside the biotechnology industry, while it positively contributes to make a
patent more relevant for the assignee's subsequent technological developments.
In addition, the broader the scope of a patent the higher the number of
citations the patent receives from subsequent non-biotechnology patents. This
relationship is inverted-U shaped when considering the influence of a patent on
inventions granted to other organizations than the patent's assignee. Finally,
the novelty of a patent is inverted-U related with the influence the patent
exerts on the subsequent inventions granted across the industrial and

architecture that has all its buffers placed at the crosspoints of input and
output lines. Scheduling is also performed inside the switching core, and does
not rely on latency-limited communications with input or output line-cards.
Compared with other legacy switching architectures, the CQ switch has the
advantages of high throughput, minimal delay, low scheduling complexity, and no
speedup requirement. However, the crosspoint buffers are small and segregated,
thus how to efficiently use the buffers and avoid packet drops remains a major
problem that needs to be addressed. In this paper, we consider load balancing,
deflection routing, and buffer pooling for efficient buffer sharing in the CQ
switch. We also design scheduling algorithms to maintain the correct packet
order even while employing multi-path switching and resolve contentions caused
by multiplexing. All these techniques require modest hardware modifications and
memory speedup in the switching core, but can greatly boost the buffer
utilizations by up to 10 times and reduce the packet drop rates by one to three
orders of magnitude. Extensive simulations and analyses have been done to
demonstrate the advantages of the proposed buffering and scheduling techniques
in various aspects. By pushing the on-chip memory to the limit of current ASIC
technology, we show that a cell drop rate of 10e-8, which is low enough for
practical uses, can be achieved under real Internet traffic traces
corresponding to a load of 0.9.

the theory should incorporate the graviton, gravitinos, and the fermions and
gauge fields of the standard model, with boson--fermion balance. Gauge field
$SU(8)$ anomalies cancel between the gravitinos and spin $\frac {1}{2}$
fermions. The 56 of scalars breaks $SU(8)$ to $SU(3)_{family} \times
SU(5)\times U(1)/Z_5$, with the fermion representation content needed for
""flipped"" $SU(5)$ with three families, and with residual scalars in the $10$
and $\overline{10}$ representations that break flipped $SU(5)$ to the standard
model. Dynamical symmetry breaking can account for the generation of $5$
representation scalars needed to break the electroweak group. Yukawa couplings
of the 56 scalars to the fermions are forbidden by chiral and gauge symmetries,
so in the first stage of $SU(8)$ breaking fermions remain massless. In the
limit of vanishing gauge coupling, there are $N=1$ and $N=8$ supersymmetries
relating the scalars to the fermions, which restrict the form of scalar
self-couplings and should improve the convergence of perturbation theory, if
not making the theory finite and ""calculable"". In an Appendix we give an

are crucial to fundamental processes such as development, motility and sensing.
Despite significant experimental and theoretical progress, the underlying
physical mechanisms behind this striking coordination remain unclear. Here, we
present a novel series of experiments in which the flagellar dynamics of two
micropipette-held somatic cells of Volvox carteri, with measurably different
intrinsic beating frequencies, are studied by high-speed imaging as a function
of their mutual separation and orientation. From analysis of beating time
series we find that the interflagellar coupling, which is constrained by the
lack of chemical and mechanical connections between the cells to be purely
hydrodynamical, exhibits a spatial dependence that is consistent with
theoretical predictions. At close spacings it produces robust synchrony which
can prevail for thousands of flagellar beats, while at increasing separations
this synchrony is systematically degraded by stochastic processes. Manipulation
of the relative flagellar orientation reveals the existence of both in-phase
and antiphase synchronized states, which is consistent with dynamical theories.
Through dynamic flagellar tracking with exquisite spatio-temporal precision, we
quantify changes in beating waveforms that result from altered coupling
configuration and distance of separation. The experimental results of this
study prove unequivocally that flagella coupled solely through a fluid medium
can achieve robust synchrony despite significant differences in their intrinsic
properties.

superconducting gap in the topological surface states with sample temperature
down to 10 K (<<91 K) and with a confidence level of sub 5 meV, much smaller

imaging provides evidence for the coexistence of two crystalline phases in
Bi2Se3/Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+ samples, which we argue to be due to the strong mismatch
of lattice crystalline symmetries. Our data identify the major contributors in
reducing the proximity-induced superconducting gap below the meV range,
including the lack of momentum space overlap between the Bi2Se3 and
Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+ Fermi surfaces, the strong mismatch of lattice crystalline

superconducting coherence length in Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+. Our ARPES studies not only
provide critical momentum space insights into the Bi2Se3/Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+

realizing a Majorana fermion condition in this system, which may be further
destabilized by the d-wave nodes dominated in a cuprate superconductor.

bits are produced by exclusive-OR operations on the precoded bits, providing
extensive rate compatibility. Unlike Raptor codes, the structure of each
additional parity bit in the protograph is explicitly designed through density
evolution. The construction method provides low iterative decoding thresholds
and the lifted codes result in excellent error rate performance for
long-blocklength PBRL codes. For short-blocklength PBRL codes the protograph
design and lifting must avoid undesired graphical structures such as trapping
sets and absorbing sets while also seeking to minimize the density evolution
threshold. Simulation results are shown in information block sizes of $k=192$,
$16368$ and $16384$. Comparing at the same information block size of $k=16368$
bits, the PBRL codes outperform the best known standardized code, the AR4JA

In this paper we investigate their formation mechanism. Observations have
indicated that the activity of the supermassive black hole located at the
Galactic center, Sgr A*, was much stronger than the present time. Specifically,
one possibility is that while Sgr A* was also in the hot accretion regime, the
accretion rate should be $10^3-10^4$ times higher during the past $\sim 10^7$
yr. On the other hand, recent MHD numerical simulations of hot accretion flows
have unambiguously shown the existence of strong winds and obtained their
properties. Based on these knowledge, by performing three-dimensional
hydrodynamical simulations, we show in this paper that the Fermi bubbles could
be inflated by winds launched from the ``past' hot accretion flow in Sgr A*. In
our model, the active phase of Sgr A* is required to last for about 10 million
years and it was quenched no more than 0.2 million years ago. The Central
Molecular Zone (CMZ) is included and it collimates the wind orientation towards
the Galactic poles. Viscosity suppresses the Rayleigh-Taylor and
Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities and results in the smoothness of the bubble
edge. The main observational features of the bubbles can be well explained.
Specifically, the {\it ROSAT} X-ray features are interpreted by the shocked
interstellar medium and the interaction region between winds and CMZ gas. The
thermal pressure and temperature obtained in our model are in good consistency
with the recent {\it Suzaku} observations.

comparable accuracy to Smith-Waterman but with faster runtimes. Similar to most
programs MaxSSmap identifies a local region of the genome followed by exact
alignment. Instead of using hash tables or Burrows-Wheeler in the first part,
MaxSSmap calculates maximum scoring subsequence score between the read and
disjoint fragments of the genome in parallel on a GPU and selects the highest
scoring fragment for exact alignment. We evaluate MaxSSmap's accuracy and
runtime when mapping simulated Illumina E.coli and human chromosome one reads
of different lengths and 10\% to 30\% mismatches with gaps to the E.coli genome
and human chromosome one. We also demonstrate applications on real data by
mapping ancient horse DNA reads to modern genomes and unmapped paired reads
from NA12878 in 1000 genomes. We show that MaxSSmap attains comparable high
accuracy and low error to fast Smith-Waterman programs yet has much lower

On short read lengths of 36 and 51 both MaxSSmap and Smith-Waterman have lower
accuracy compared to at higher lengths. On real data MaxSSmap produces many
alignments with high score and mapping quality that are not given by NextGenMap

active atmospheric circulations. In this study we use a shallow-water model to
investigate the global atmospheric dynamics in the stratified layer overlying
the convective zone on these rapidly rotating objects. We show that the
existence and properties of the atmospheric circulation crucially depend on key
parameters including the energy injection rate and radiative timescale. Under
conditions of strong internal heat flux and weak radiative dissipation, a
banded flow pattern comprising east-west jet streams spontaneously emerges from
the interaction of atmospheric turbulence with the planetary rotation. In
contrast, when the internal heat flux is weak and/or radiative dissipation is
strong, turbulence injected into the atmosphere damps before it can
self-organize into jets, leading to a flow dominated by transient eddies and
isotropic turbulence instead. The simulation results are not very sensitive to
the form of the forcing. Based on the location of the transition between
jet-dominated and eddy-dominated regimes, we suggest that many brown dwarfs may
exhibit atmospheric circulations dominated by eddies and turbulence (rather
than jets) due to the strong radiative damping on these worlds, but a jet
structure is also possible under some realistic conditions. Our simulated light
curves capture important features from observed infrared lightcurves of brown
dwarfs, including amplitude variations of a few percent and shapes that
fluctuate between single-peak and multi-peak structures. More broadly, our work
shows that the shallow-water system provides a useful tool to illuminate
fundamental aspects of the dynamics on these worlds.

identification process. In other respect, the derivation of the adjoint model

studied, the excited singlet state, $S_1$ is at more than twice the energy of
the lowest triplet state and the second triplet is very close to $S_1$ state.
Thus donor-acceptor substituted tetracene could be a good candidate in
photo-voltaic device application as it satisfies energy criteria for singlet
fission. We have also obtained the model exact second harmonic generation (SHG)
coefficients using correction vector method and we find that the SHG responses
increase with the increase in D/A strength.

  Overlapping Variable Sets",,,,,"stat.ML cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Scientific practice typically involves repeatedly studying a system, each
time trying to unravel a different perspective. In each study, the scientist
may take measurements under different experimental conditions (interventions,
manipulations, perturbations) and measure different sets of quantities
(variables). The result is a collection of heterogeneous data sets coming from
different data distributions. In this work, we present algorithm COmbINE, which
accepts a collection of data sets over overlapping variable sets under
different experimental conditions; COmbINE then outputs a summary of all causal
models indicating the invariant and variant structural characteristics of all
models that simultaneously fit all of the input data sets. COmbINE converts
estimated dependencies and independencies in the data into path constraints on
the data-generating causal model and encodes them as a SAT instance. The
algorithm is sound and complete in the sample limit. To account for conflicting
constraints arising from statistical errors, we introduce a general method for
sorting constraints in order of confidence, computed as a function of their
corresponding p-values. In our empirical evaluation, COmbINE outperforms in
terms of efficiency the only pre-existing similar algorithm; the latter
additionally admits feedback cycles, but does not admit conflicting constraints
which hinders the applicability on real data. As a proof-of-concept, COmbINE is
employed to co-analyze 4 real, mass-cytometry data sets measuring
phosphorylated protein concentrations of overlapping protein sets under 3
different interventions.

kinematics of the semi-regular variable star RS Cnc on spatial scales ranging
from ~1"" (~150 AU) to ~6' (~0.25 pc). New modeling of CO1-0 and CO2-1 imaging
observations leads to a revised characterization of RS Cnc's previously
identified axisymmetric molecular outflow. Rather than a simple disk-outflow
picture, we find that a gradient in velocity as a function of latitude is
needed to fit the spatially resolved spectra, and in our preferred model, the
density and the velocity vary smoothly from the equatorial plane to the polar
axis. In terms of density, the source appears quasi-spherical, whereas in terms
of velocity the source is axi-symmetric with a low expansion velocity in the
equatorial plane and faster outflows in the polar directions. The flux of
matter is also larger in the polar directions than in the equatorial plane. An
implication of our model is that the stellar wind is still accelerated at radii
larger than a few hundred AU, well beyond the radius where the terminal
velocity is thought to be reached in an asymptotic giant branch star. The HI
data show the previously detected head-tail morphology, but also supply
additional detail about the atomic gas distribution and kinematics. We confirm
that the `head' seen in HI is elongated in a direction consistent with the
polar axis of the molecular outflow, suggesting that we are tracing an
extension of the molecular outflow well beyond the molecular dissociation
radius (up to ~0.05 pc). The 6'-long HI `tail' is oriented at a PA of
305{\deg}, consistent with the space motion of the star. We measure a total
mass of atomic hydrogen ~0.0055 solar mass and estimate a lower limit to the
timescale for the formation of the tail to be ~6.4x10^4 years. (abridged)

non-Gaussian states even when, e.g., the entropic criterion that also involves

Background-derived expansion history predictions. The motivation is to
investigate if the tension between the local (cosmology independent) Hubble
constant H0 value and the Planck-derived H0 is also present at other redshifts.
We conclude that there is no tension between Planck and cosmology
independent-measurements of the Hubble parameter H(z) at 0.1 < z < 1.2 for the
LCDM model (odds of tension are only 1:15, statistically not significant).
Considering extensions of the LCDM model does not improve these odds (actually
makes them worse), thus favouring the simpler model over its extensions. On the
other hand the H(z) data are also not in tension with the local H0 measurements
but the combination of all three data-sets shows a highly significant tension
(odds ~ 1:400). Thus the new data deepen the mystery of the mismatch between
Planck and local H0 measurements, and cannot univocally determine wether it is
an effect localised at a particular redshift. Having said this, we find that
assuming the NGC4258 maser distance as the correct anchor for H0, brings the
odds to comfortable values.
  Further, using only the expansion history measurements we constrain, within
the LCDM model, H0 = 68.5 +- 3.5 and Omega_m = 0.32 +- 0.05 without relying on
any CMB prior. We also address the question of how smooth the expansion history

variations with time in the value of the equation of state of dark energy.

of growing circular discs allowing only a `slight' overlapping among them just
before their growth stop. More specifically, each disc grows from a nucleation
center that is selected at a random location within the uncovered region. The
growth rate $\delta$ is a continuously tunable parameter of the problem which
assumes a specific value while a particular pattern of discs is generated. When
a growing disc overlaps for the first time with at least another disc, it's
growth is stopped and is said to be `frozen'. In this paper we study the
percolation properties of the set of frozen discs. Using numerical simulations
we present evidence for the following: (i) The Order Parameter appears to jump
discontinuously at a certain critical value of the area coverage; (ii) the
width of the window of the area coverage needed to observe a macroscopic jump
in the Order Parameter tends to vanish as $\delta \to 0$ and on the contrary
(iii) the cluster size distribution has a power law decaying functional form.
While the first two results are the signatures of a discontinuous transition,
the third result is indicative of a continuous transition. Therefore we refer
this transition as a sharp but continuous transition similar to what has been
observed in the recently introduced Achlioptas process of Explosive
Percolation. It is also observed that in the limit of $\delta \to 0$, the
critical area coverage at the transition point tends to unity, implying the
limiting pattern is space-filling. In this limit, the fractal dimension of the
pore space at the percolation point has been estimated to be $1.42(10)$ and the
contact network of the disc assembly is found to be a scale-free network.

of such polynomial sets allows us to improve the known upper bounds on the

bivariate settings, the polynomial masks of a tight wavelet frame can be
interpreted as the transfer function of a conservative multivariate linear
system. Recent advances in system theory enable us to develop a more effective

show that for dimension greater than 2 such transfer function representations

stars can be as conveniently compared to stellar evolution calculations in the

our ordinate is proportional to the stellar mass-to-luminosity ratio, which can
thus be directly determined. For intermediate- and low-mass star evolution at

neglected. Plastic rearrangements require an energy input, which can be either
provided by external sources, or made available through time evolution in the
coarsening dynamics, in which the total interfacial area decreases as a
consequence of the slow evolution of the dispersed phase from smaller to large
droplets/bubbles. We first demonstrate that our hydrodynamic model can
quantitatively reproduce such coarsening dynamics. Then, considering
periodically oscillating strains, we characterize the number of plastic
rearrangements as a function of the external energy-supply, and show that they
can be regarded as activated processes induced by a suitable ""noise"" effect.
Here we use the word noise in a broad sense, referring to the internal
non-equilibrium dynamics triggered by spatial random heterogeneities and
coarsening. Finally, by exploring the interplay between the internal
characteristic time-scale of the coarsening dynamics and the external
time-scale associated with the imposed oscillating strain, we show that the

\mathbb R$ and let $\mu$ be a probability measure on $I^X$. Then $\tau$ is a
solution of the Skorokhod embedding problem (SEP) for $\mu$ in $X$ if $\tau$ is
a stopping time and $X_\tau \sim \mu$.
  There are well-known conditions which determine whether there exists a
solution of the SEP for $\mu$ in $X$. We give necessary and sufficient
conditions for there to exist an integrable solution. Further, if there exists
a solution of the SEP then there exists a minimal solution. We show that every
minimal solution of the SEP has the same first moment.
  When $X$ is Brownian motion, every integrable embedding of $\mu$ is minimal.
However, for a general diffusion there may be integrable embeddings which are
not minimal.

of a GRB and demonstrate a clear rise in flux less than one day after the
gamma-ray trigger followed by a rapid decline. This early time radio emission
probably originates in the GRB reverse shock so our AMI light curve reveals the
first ever confirmed detection of a reverse shock peak in the radio domain. At
later times (about 3.2 days post-burst) the rate of decline decreases,
indicating that the forward shock component has begun to dominate the

variability, the question of the presence of a magnetic field cannot be
answered without proper modeling of the impact of such a variability on the
measurements of the magnetic field. Since the short-term periodicity does not
fit into the currently known domain of non-radially pulsating supergiants, its

present work studies the dynamical behaviours of a fast spinning tethered
binary system under central gravitational field, and derives principles of the
basic laws of orbital maneuver. Considering the characteristics of coupled
librational and orbital motions, an averaging method is introduced to deal with
the slow-fast system equation, thus a definite equivalent model is derived. The
general orbit motion is completely determined analytically, including the orbit
geometry, periodicity, conversations and moving region etc. Since the
possibility of orbit control using tether reaction has been proved by previous
studies, special attention is paid to the transportation mode of angular
momentum and mechanical energy between the orbit and libration. The effect of
tether length change on the orbit shape is verified both in the averaged model

efficiently verify security protocols with tamper-resistant global states. In
this paper, we address this problem by first proposing a protocol specification
framework, which explicitly represents protocol execution states and state
transformations. Secondly, we develop an algorithm for verifying security
properties by utilizing the key ingredients of the first-order reasoning for
reachability analysis, while tracking state transformation and checking the
validity of newly generated states. Our verification algorithm is proven to be
(partially) correct, if it terminates. We have implemented the proposed
framework and verification algorithms in a tool named SSPA, and evaluate it
using a number of stateful security protocols. The experimental results show
that our approach is not only feasible but also practically efficient. In
particular, we have found a security flaw on the digital envelope protocol,
which could not be detected by existing security protocol verifiers.

fundamental and harmonic frequencies is a familiar process known from solar
type II radio bursts. Current models assume the existence of counterstreaming
electron beam populations excited at shocks as sources for these emission
features, which limits the plasma parameters to reasonable heliospheric shock
conditions. However, situations in which counterstreaming electron beams are
present can also occur with different plasma parameters, such as higher
magnetisation, including but not limited to our Sun. Similar radio emissions
might also occur from these situations.
  Methods: We used particle-in-cell simulations, to compare plasma microphysics
of radio emission processes from counterstreaming beams in different plasma
environments that differed in density and magnetization.
  Results: Although large differences in wave populations are evident, the
emission process of type II bursts appears to be qualitatively unaffected and
shows the same behaviour in all environments.

LHS 6343 A with a period of 12.71 days. In addition, an out-of-eclipse light
modulation with the same period and a relative semi-amplitude of 2 x 10^-4 was
observed showing an almost constant phase lag to the eclipses produced by the
brown dwarf. In a previous work, we concluded that this was due to the light
modulation induced by photospheric active regions in LHS 6343 A. Aims. In the
present work, we prove that most of the out-of-eclipse light modulation is
caused by the Doppler-beaming induced by the orbital motion of the primary
star. Methods. We introduce a model of the Doppler-beaming for an eccentric
orbit and also considered the ellipsoidal effect. The data were fitted using a
Bayesian approach implemented through a Monte Carlo Markov chain method. Model
residuals were analysed by searching for periodicities using a Lomb-Scargle
periodogram. Results. For the first seven quarters of Kepler observations and
the orbit previously derived from the radial velocity measurements, we show
that the light modulation of the system outside eclipses is dominated by the
Doppler-beaming effect. A period search performed on the residuals shows a
significant periodicity of 42.5 +- 3.2 days with a false-alarm probability of 5

domain in $\mathbb{R}^d$ for $d \geq 3$ from the Dirichlet to Neumann map. This
problem is related to the inverse Calder\'on conductivity problem via the
Liouville transformation. It is known from the work of Haberman and Tataru [11]
and Nachman and Lavine [17] that uniqueness holds for the class of
conductivities of one derivative and the class of $W^{2,d/2}$ conductivities
respectively. The proof of Haberman and Tataru is based on the construction of
complex geometrical optics (CGO) solutions initially suggested by Sylvester and
Uhlmann [22], in functional spaces introduced by Bourgain [2]. The proof of the
second result, in the work of Ferreira et al. [10], is based on the
construction of CGO solutions via Carleman estimates. The main goal of the
paper is to understand whether or not an approach which is based on the
construction of CGO solutions in the spirit of Sylvester and Uhlmann and
involves only standard Sobolev spaces can be used to obtain these results. In
fact, we are able to obtain a new proof of uniqueness for the Calder\'on
problem for 1) a slightly different class as the one in [11], and for 2) the
class of $W^{2,d/2}$ conductivities. The proof of statement 1) is based on a
new estimate for CGO solutions and some averaging estimates in the same spirit
as in [11]. The proof of statement 2) is on the one hand based on a generalized
Sobolev inequality due to Kenig et al. [14] and on another hand, only involves
standard estimates for CGO solutions [22]. We are also able to prove the
uniqueness of a potential for 3) the class of $W^{s, 3/s}$ ($\supsetneqq W^{2,
3/2}$) conductivities with $3/2 < s < 2$ in three dimensions. As far as we

Thermal Rossby waves propagating in the azimuthal direction are found as
solutions. The analogy to the case of Boussinesq convection in the presence of
conical end surfaces of the annular region is emphasized. As in the latter case
the results can be applied as an approximation for the description of the onset
of anelastic convection in rotating spherical fluid shells. Reasonable
agreement with three-dimensional numerical results published by Jones et al.

As in those results the location of the onset of convection shifts outward from
the tangent cylinder with increasing number $N_\rho$ of density scale heights
until it reaches the equatorial boundary. A new result is that at a much higher
number $N_\rho$ the onset location returns to the interior of the fluid shell.

compared in detail with UV imaging and radio spectrography over a broad

the late relativistic proton release to interplanetary space was accompanied by
a distinct new episode of energy release and electron acceleration in the

proton acceleration to magnetic reconnection and possibly to turbulence in
large-scale coronal loops. While Type II radio emission was observed in the
high corona, no evidence of a temporal relationship with the relativistic

exceeding any expected galactic interstellar contribution, especially along the
moderate to high-galactic-latitude directions in which such events have been
most often observed. The dispersions have been therefore interpreted as
extragalactic, leading to the inference that the sources of the bursts are at
Gpc distances. This then implies that the bursts are extremely energetic
events, originating from quite small volumes (due to the millisecond burst
durations). To circumvent the energetic difficulties, Loeb, Shvartzvald, & Maoz
(2014) propose that the bursts are produced by flares near the surfaces of M
stars or contact binaries within a local volume of the galaxy. Most of the
dispersion would then occur in the overlying stellar coronae. With the
dispersion concentrated in a relatively high density region, the quadratic
dispersion approximation breaks down as the plasma frequency is comparable to
(although less than) the propagation frequency. The observed dispersion curves
are closely quadratic, however, consistent with a low density medium, ruling
out this model. Because any model invoking local galactic sources would require
a concentrated high density dispersing medium, it appears highly likely that
the dispersions occur in the intergalactic medium. This medium, probably
containing most of the baryon content of the universe, is expected to be highly
structured on large scales. Hot gas within clusters and especially groups of
galaxies may contribute significantly to the observed dispersion. Optical and
X-ray observations, including redshifts and combined with cosmological
dispersion measures, can probe the distribution of the IGM and determine how
much of it lies outside the X-ray luminous concentrations seen in clusters and
groups.

of stars hosting a habitable planet with respect to the ""classical"" model
results, in the region of maximum probability for this occurrence, relative to
the classical model results. These results are obtained by taking into account
the supernova destruction processes. In particular, we find that in the Milky

Galactic center, and the model with radial flows predicts a number which is 38%
larger than what predicted by the classical model. For Andromeda we find that
the maximum number of stars with habitable planets is at 16 kpc from the center

single-point vorticity statistics: first, they are defined from velocity
measurements only, so an accurate resolution of the Kolmogorov scale is not
required; second, they provide information on the scale-dependence of the

slamming wave acting on a rigid wall. In the present study the analytical
approach is pursued based on a technique proposed by the author. A nonlinear
theory in the context of potential flow is presented for determining accurately
the free-surface profiles immediately after an oblique breaking wave
impingement on the rigid vertical wall that suddenly starts from rest. The
small-time expansion is taken as far as necessary to include the accelerating
effect. The analytical solutions for the free-surface elevation are derived up
to the third order. The results derived in this paper are of particular
interest to the marine and offshore engineering industries, which will find the
information useful for the design of ships, coastal and offshore.

sense that the positive Jacobi sequence is replaced by a sequence of positive
Hermitean (square) matrices and the real Jacobi sequence by a sequence of
Hermitean matri ces of the same dimension. Moreover, in this identification,
the multidimensional extension of the compatibility condition for the positive
Jacobi sequence becomes the condition which guarantees the existence of the
creator in an interacting Fock space. The above result opens the way to the
program of a purely algebraic clas sification of probability measures on
$\mathbb{R}^d$ with finite moments of any order. In this classification the
usual Boson Fock space over $\mathbb{C}^d$ is characterized by the fact that
the positive Jacobi sequence is made up of identity matrices and the real
Jacobi sequences are identically zero. The quantum decomposition of classical
real valued random variables with all moments is one of the main ingredients in
the proof.

electric current in quantum collisionless plasma at any temperature are
deduced. It has appeared, that the nonlinearity account leads to occurrence of
the longitudinal electric current directed along a wave vector. This second
current is orthogonal to the known transversal classical current, received at
the classical linear analysis. The case of degenerate electronic plasma is
considered. The concept of longitudinal-transversal conductivity is entered.
The graphic analysis of the real and imaginary parts of dimensionless
coefficient of longitudinal-transversal conductivity is made. It is shown, that
for degenerate plasmas the electric current is calculated under the formula,
not containing quadratures. In this formula we have allocated known Kohn's
singularities (W. Kohn, 1959).

to approximate the so-called Steiner Problem, but also the average distance
problem, and finally a problem relying on the p-compliance energy. The proof of

Gamma-convergence relies on technical tools from geometric measure theory, as

formation, with the magnetorotational instability (MRI) in accretions disks as
the most prominent example. Considerable theoretical and computational progress
has been made in understanding both the dynamo effect as well as magnetically

  Various Compositions of Spatially Spread Polarized Antenna Arrays","40 pages, 18 figures, to appear in Signal Processing",,,,"physics.ins-det","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Various compositions of sparsely polarized antenna arrays are proposed in
this paper to estimate the direction-of-arrivals (DOAs) and polarizations of
multiple coherent sources. These polarized antenna arrays are composed of one
of the following five sparsely-spread sub-array geometries: 1) four
spatially-spread dipoles with three orthogonal orientations, 2) four
spatially-spread loops with three orthogonal orientations, 3) three
spatially-spread dipoles and three spatially-spread loops with orthogonal
orientations, 4) three collocated dipole-loop pairs with orthogonal
orientations, and 5) a collocated dipole-triad and a collocated loop-triad. All
the dipoles/loops/pairs/triads in each sub-array can also be sparsely spaced
with the inter-antenna spacing far larger than a half-wavelength. Only one
dimensional spatial-smoothing is used in the proposed algorithm to derive the
two-dimensional DOAs and polarizations of multiple cross-correlated signals.
From the simulation results, the sparse array composed of dipole-triads and
loop-triads is recommended to construct a large aperture array, while the
sparse arrays composed of only dipoles or only loops are recommended to
efficiently reduce the mutual coupling across the antennas. Practical
applications include distributed arrays and passive radar systems.
