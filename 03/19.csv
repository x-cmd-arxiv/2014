Sun-like stars -- those with surface convection zones and non-convective
interior regions. Previous models do not match the morphology of observed
(rotation period)-color diagrams, notably the existence of a relatively
long-lived ""C-sequence"" of fast rotators first identified by Barnes(2003). This
failure motivates the Metastable Dynamo Model (MDM) described here. The MDM
posits that stars are born with their magnetic dynamos operating in a mode that
couples very weakly to the stellar wind, so their (initially very short)
rotation periods at first change little with time. At some point, this mode
spontaneously and randomly changes to a strongly-coupled mode, the transition
occurring with a mass-dependent lifetime that is of order 100 MYr. I show that
with this assumption, one can obtain good fits to observations of young
clusters, particularly for ages of 150 MYr to 200 MYr. Previous models and the
MDM both give qualitative agreement with the morphology of the slower-rotating
""I-sequence"" stars, but none of them have been shown to accurately reproduce
the stellar-mass-dependent evolution of the I-sequence stars, especially for
clusters older than a few hundred MYr. I discuss observational experiments that
can test aspects of the MDM, and speculate that the physics underlying the MDM
may be related to other situations described in the literature, in which
stellar dynamos may have a multi-modal character.

growth rate, and the evolution of velocity, magnetic field vector and
thermodynamic parameters of turbulent drops. We perform 2.5D numerical
simulations of the instability initiated by a multi-mode perturbation at the
corona-prominence interface using a single-fluid MHD approach including a
generalized Ohm's law. The initial equilibrium configuration is purely
hydrostatic and contains a homogeneous horizontal magnetic field forming an
angle with the direction in which the plasma is perturbed. We analyze
simulations with two different orientations of the magnetic field. For each
field orientation we compare two simulations, one for the pure MHD case, and
one including the ambipolar diffusion in the Ohm's law (AD case). Other than
that, both simulations for each field orientation are identical. The numerical
results in the initial stage of the instability are compared with the
analytical linear calculations. We find that the configuration is always
unstable in the AD case. The growth rate of the small-scale modes in the
non-linear regime is up to 50% larger in the AD case than in the purely MHD
case and the average velocities of flows are a few percent larger. Significant
drift momenta are found at the interface between the coronal and the prominence
material at all stages of the instability, produced by the faster downward
motion of the neutral component with respect to the ionized component. The
differences in temperature of the bubbles between the ideal and non-ideal case
are also significant, reaching 30%. There is an asymmetry between large rising
bubbles and small-scale down flowing fingers, favoring the detection of upward
velocities in observations.

(which includes the static paramagnetic phase). In the paramagnetic phase,
conservation of PT -symmetry implies that all cumulants are sub-linear in time,

that can produce sparse estimators when the number of predictors (p) is large.
Oracle inequalities provide probability loss bounds for the Lasso estimator at
a deterministic choice of the regularization parameter. These bounds tend to
zero if p is appropriately controlled, and are thus commonly cited as
theoretical justification for the Lasso and its ability to handle
high-dimensional settings. Unfortunately, in practice the regularization
parameter is not selected to be a deterministic quantity, but is instead chosen
using a random, data-dependent procedure. To address this shortcoming of
previous theoretical work, we study the loss of the Lasso estimator when tuned
optimally for prediction. Assuming orthonormal predictors and a sparse true
model, we prove that the probability that the best possible predictive
performance of the Lasso deteriorates as p increases is positive and can be
arbitrarily close to one given a sufficiently high signal to noise ratio and
sufficiently large p. We further demonstrate empirically that the amount of
deterioration in performance can be far worse than the oracle inequalities
suggest and provide a real data example where deterioration is observed.

while a plasma is unstable to the Buneman instability in force-free current

effects generated by wave-particle interactions in Buneman instability can be
approximately described by a set of electron fluid equations. We show that both
energy dissipation and momentum transport along electric current in the current
layer are locally quasi-static, but globally dynamic and irreversible.
Turbulent drag dissipates both the streaming energy of the current sheet and
the associated magnetic energy. The net loss of streaming energy is converted
into the electron component heat conduction parallel to the magnetic field and
increases the electron Boltzmann entropy. The growth of self-sustained Buneman
waves satisfies a Bernoulli-like equation that relates the turbulence-induced
convective momentum transport and thermal momentum transport. Electron trapping
and de-trapping drive local momentum transports, while phase mixing converts
convective momentum into thermal momentum. The drag acts like a micro-macro
link in the anomalous heating processes. The decrease of magnetic field
maintains an inductive electric field that re-accelerates electrons, but most
of the magnetic energy is dissipated and converted into the component heat of
electrons perpendicular to the magnetic field. This heating process is
decoupled from the heating of Buneman instability in the current sheets. Ion
heating is weak but ions plays an important role in assisting energy exchanges
between waves and electrons. Cold ion fluid equations together with our
electron fluid equations form a complete set of equations that describes the
occurrence, growth, saturation and decay of the Buneman instability.

single weak element. In such a system, quantum phase tunnelling by $2\pi $
occurring at the weak element couples the states of the ring with supercurrents
circulating in opposite directions, while the rest of the ring provides an
intrinsic electromagnetic environment of the qubit. Taking into account the
capacitive coupling between nearest neighbors and the capacitance to the

electrodynamic modes which couple to the two levels of the flux qubit. In
particular, when the number of Josephson junctions is increased, several
low-energy modes can have frequencies lower than the qubit frequency. This
gives rise to a quasiperiodic dynamics, which manifests itself as a decay of
oscillations between the two counterpropagating current states at short times,
followed by oscillation-like revivals at later times. We analyze how the system
approaches such a dynamics as the ring's length is increased and discuss
possible experimental implications of this non-adiabatic regime.

decisive quantities such as halo mass, concentration, triaxiality, and
orientation with respect to the observer. Thus, the largest Einstein radii can
potentially be utilised to test the predictions of the LCDM model. Hitherto,
studies have focussed on the single largest observed ER. We extend those
studies by employing order statistics to formulate exclusion criteria based on
the n largest Einstein radii and apply these criteria to the strong lensing
analysis of 12 MACS clusters at z>0.5. We obtain the order statistics of
Einstein radii by a MC approach, based on the semi-analytic modelling of the
halo population on the past lightcone. After sampling the order statistics, we
fit a GEV distribution to the first-order distribution, which allows us to
derive analytic relations for the order statistics of the Einstein radii. We
find that the Einstein radii of the 12 MACS clusters are not in conflict with
the LCDM expectations. Our exclusion criteria indicate that, in order to
exhibit tension with the concordance model, one would need to observe
approximately twenty Einstein radii >30"", ten >35"" or five >42"" in the range of
0.5<z<1.0 on the full sky. Furthermore, we find that, with increasing order,
the haloes with the largest Einstein radii are on average less aligned along
the line-of-sight and less triaxial. In general, the cumulative distribution
functions steepen for higher orders, giving them better constraining power.

localized reproduction, induces spatial clustering and, in turn, focuses
ecological interactions at the neighborhood scale. In particular, most invasive
plants are clonal, cluster through vegetative propagation, and compete locally.
Dispersal limitation implies that invasive spread occurs as advance of an
ecological interface between invader and resident species. Interspecific
competition along the interface produces random variation in the extent of
invasive growth. Development of these random fluctuations, termed stochastic
roughening, will often structure the interface as a self-affine fractal; a
series of power-law scaling relationships follows as a result. For a diverse
array of local growth processes exhibiting both forward and lateral
propagation, the extent of invader advance becomes spatially correlated along
the interface, and the width of the interface (the area where invader and
resident compete directly) increases as a power function of time. Once
roughening equilibrates statistically, interface width and the location of the
most advanced invader (the ""front-runner"") beyond the mean incursion should
both increase as a power function of interface length. To test these
predictions, we let white clover (Trifolium repens) invade ryegrass (Lolium
perenne) experimentally. Spatial correlation developed as anticipated, and both
interface width and the front-runner's lead scaled as a power law of length.
However, the scaling exponents differed, likely a consequence of clover's
growth morphology. The theory of kinetic roughening offers a new framework for
understanding causes and consequences of spatial pattern in between-species
interaction, and indicates when interface measures at a local scale predict
properties of an invasive front at extended spatial scales.

zero-initial-Bondi-momentum frame) as proportional to the total gravitational
wave impulse imparted on the system. The kick velocity distributions are
obtained and analyzed for two distinct classes of initial data corresponding to
the early post-merger state of (i) non-head-on collisions and (ii) head-on

momentum fluxes and associated kicks are evaluated for a given domain of
parameters (incidence angle and mass ratio). Typically for the equal mass case
the net gravitational wave momentum flux carried is nonzero. This last result
indicates that these configurations are not connected with black hole binary
inspirals or head-on collisions. We suggest that these systems might be a
candidate to an approximate description of the post-merger phase of a

greater than the upper limit r < 0.11 obtained from the temperature
anisotropies under the assumption of a constant scalar spectral index n_s. This
discrepancy can be reduced once the statistical error and the contamination
from polarized dust are accounted for. If however a large value for r will be
confirmed, it will need to be reconciled with the temperature anisotropies
data. The most advocated explanation involves a variation of n_s with scales
(denoted as running) that has a magnitude significantly greater than the
generic slow roll predictions. We instead study the possibility that the large
scale temperature anisotropies are not enhanced because of a suppression of the
scalar power at large scales. Such a situation can be achieved for instance by
a sudden change of the speed of the inflaton (by about 14 %), and we show that
it fits the temperature anisotropies and polarization data considerably better
than a constant running (its chi^2 improves by ~ 7.5 over that of the constant
running, at the cost of one more parameter). We also consider the possibility
that the large scale temperature fluctuations are suppressed by an
anti-correlation between tensor and scalar modes. Unfortunately, while such
effect does affect the temperature fluctuations at large scales, it does not
affect the temperature power spectrum and cannot, therefore, help in
reconciling a large value of r with the limits from temperature fluctuations.

$\sum m_{\nu} = 0.36\pm0.14\,$eV ($68\%$ c.l.), which represents a $2.6\sigma$
preference for non-zero neutrino mass. The significance can be increased to
$3.3\sigma$ when including weak lensing results and other BAO constraints,
yielding $\sum m_{\nu} = 0.35\pm0.10\,$eV ($68\%$ c.l.). However, combining
CMASS with Planck data reduces the preference for neutrino mass to $\sim
2\sigma$. When removing the CMB lensing effect in the Planck temperature power
spectrum (by marginalising over $A_{\rm L}$), we see shifts of $\sim 1\sigma$
in $\sigma_8$ and $\Omega_m$, which have a significant effect on the neutrino
mass constraints. In case of CMASS plus Planck without the $A_{\rm L}$-lensing
signal, we find a preference for a neutrino mass of $\sum m_{\nu} = 0.34\pm

Codimension two objects carry non-Abelian charges which are elements of a
discrete U-duality group and they may not admit a simple space-time
description, in which case they are known as exotic branes. A complete
classification of consistent codimension two objects in string theory is
missing, even if we demand that they preserve some supersymmetry. As a step
toward such a classification, we study the supersymmetric solutions of 3D
maximal supergravity, which can be regarded as approximate description of the
geometry near codimension two objects. We present a complete classification of
the types of supersymmetric solutions that exist in this theory. We found that
this problem reduces to that of classifying nilpotent orbits associated with
the U-duality group, for which various mathematical results are known. We show
that the only allowed supersymmetric configurations are 1/2, 1/4, 1/8, and 1/16
BPS, and determine the nilpotent orbits that they correspond to. One example of
1/16 BPS configurations is a generalization of the MSW system, where momentum
runs along the intersection of seven M5-branes. On the other hand, it turns out
exceedingly difficult to translate this classification into a simple criterion
for supersymmetry in terms of the non-Abelian (monodromy) charges of the
objects. For example, it can happen that a supersymmetric solution exists
locally but cannot be extended all the way to the location of the object. To
illustrate the various issues that arise in constructing supersymmetric

high-energy, optical, and zone-boundary phonons contribute as much as acoustic
phonons to the intrinsic electrical resistivity even at room temperature and

filters that are sensitive to the presence of young stars, is often used to
infer the star formation rate (SFR) for that population. However, these
techniques rely on an assumption that star formation is a continuous process,
whereas in reality stars form in discrete spatially- and temporally-correlated
structures. This discreteness causes the light output to undergo significant
time-dependent fluctuations, which, if not accounted for, introduce systematic
errors in the inferred SFRs due to the intrinsic distribution of luminosities
at any fix SFR. We use SLUG, a code that Stochastically Lights Up Galaxies, to
simulate galaxies undergoing stochastic star formation. We then use these
simulations to present a quantitative analysis of these effects and provide
tools for calculating probability distribution functions of SFRs given a set of
observations. We show that, depending on the SFR tracer used, stochastic
fluctuations can produce non-trivial errors at SFRs as high as 1 M/yr, and
biases >0.5 dex at the lowest SFRs. We emphasize that due to the stochastic
behavior of blue SFR tracers, one cannot assign a deterministic single value to
the SFR of an individual galaxy, but we suggest methods by which future
analyses that rely on integrated-light indicators can properly account for
these stochastic effects.

or reposting functionality allows users to share others' content with their own
friends or followers. As content is reshared from user to user, large cascades
of reshares can form. While a growing body of research has focused on analyzing
and characterizing such cascades, a recent, parallel line of work has argued
that the future trajectory of a cascade may be inherently unpredictable. In
this work, we develop a framework for addressing cascade prediction problems.
On a large sample of photo reshare cascades on Facebook, we find strong
performance in predicting whether a cascade will continue to grow in the
future. We find that the relative growth of a cascade becomes more predictable
as we observe more of its reshares, that temporal and structural features are
key predictors of cascade size, and that initially, breadth, rather than depth
in a cascade is a better indicator of larger cascades. This prediction
performance is robust in the sense that multiple distinct classes of features
all achieve similar performance. We also discover that temporal features are
predictive of a cascade's eventual shape. Observing independent cascades of the
same content, we find that while these cascades differ greatly in size, we are
still able to predict which ends up the largest.

of star formation in IC 1613. We compare the SFH of IC 1613 with expectations
from cosmological models. Since most of the mass is in place at early times for
low mass halos, a naive expectation is that most of the star formation should
have taken place at early times. Models in which star formation follows mass
accretion result in too many stars formed early and gas mass fractions which
are too low today (the ""over-cooling problem""). The depth of the present

to test the performance of these cluster mass estimation techniques on a
diverse set of models that will increase in complexity. We begin by providing
participating methods with data from a simple model that delivers idealised
clusters, enabling us to quantify the underlying scatter intrinsic to these
mass estimation techniques. The mock catalogue is based on a Halo Occupation
Distribution (HOD) model that assumes spherical Navarro, Frenk and White (NFW)
haloes truncated at R_200, with no substructure nor colour segregation, and
with isotropic, isothermal Maxwellian velocities. We find that, above 10^14
M_solar, recovered cluster masses are correlated with the true underlying
cluster mass with an intrinsic scatter of typically a factor of two. Below
10^14 M_solar, the scatter rises as the number of member galaxies drops and
rapidly approaches an order of magnitude. We find that richness-based methods
deliver the lowest scatter, but it is not clear whether such accuracy may
simply be the result of using an over-simplistic model to populate the galaxies
in their haloes. Even when given the true cluster membership, large scatter is
observed for the majority non-richness-based approaches, suggesting that mass
reconstruction with a low number of dynamical tracers is inherently
problematic.

capillary force between the tip and substrate is calculated as a function of
their separation h. The force agrees with continuum predictions for h down to ~
5 to 10nm. At smaller h, the force tends to be less attractive than predicted
and has strong oscillations. This oscillatory component of the capillary force
is completely missed in the continuum theory, which only includes contributions
from the surface tension around the circumference of the meniscus and the
pressure difference over the cross section of the meniscus. The oscillation is
found to be due to molecular layering of the liquid confined in the narrow gap
between the tip and substrate. This effect is most pronounced for large tip
radii and/or smooth surfaces. The other two components considered by the
continuum theory are also identified. The surface tension term, as well as the
meniscus shape, is accurately described by the continuum prediction for h down
to ~ 1nm, but the capillary pressure term is always more positive than the
corresponding continuum result. This shift in the capillary pressure reduces
the average adhesion by a factor as large as 2 from its continuum value and is
found to be due to an anisotropy in the pressure tensor. The cross-sectional
component is consistent with the capillary pressure predicted by the continuum
theory (i.e., the Young-Laplace equation), but the normal pressure that

distinct populations. The Radiative-Mode AGN are associated with black holes
that produce radiant energy powered by accretion at rates in excess of ~1% of
the Eddington Limit. They are primarily associated with less massive black
holes growing in high-density pseudo-bulges at a rate sufficient to produce the
total mass budget in these black holes in ~10 Gyr. The circum-nuclear
environment contains high density cold gas and associated star-formation. Major
mergers are not the primary mechanism for transporting this gas inward; secular
processes appear dominant. Stellar feedback will be generic in these objects
and strong AGN feedback is seen only in the most powerful AGN. In Jet-Mode AGN
the bulk of energetic output takes the form of collimated outflows (jets).
These AGN are associated with the more massive black holes in more massive
(classical) bulges and elliptical galaxies. Neither the accretion onto these
black holes nor star-formation in their host bulge is significant today. These
AGN are probably fueled by the accretion of slowly cooling hot gas that is
limited by the feedback/heating provided by AGN radio sources. Surveys of the
high-redshift universe are painting a similar picture. (Abridged).

element of adaptation. Unless population are well-mixed (like bacteria in a
shaken test tube), the spreading dynamics not only depends on fitness
differences but also on the dispersal behavior of the species. Spreading at a
constant speed is generally predicted when dispersal is sufficiently
short-ranged. However, the case of long-range dispersal is unresolved: While it
is clear that even rare long-range jumps can lead to a drastic speedup, it has
been difficult to quantify the ensuing stochastic growth process. Yet such
knowledge is indispensable to reveal general laws for the spread of modern
human epidemics, which is greatly accelerated by aviation. We present a simple
iterative scaling approximation supported by simulations and rigorous bounds
that accurately predicts evolutionary spread for broad distributions of long
distance dispersal. In contrast to the exponential laws predicted by
deterministic ""mean-field"" approximations, we show that the asymptotic growth
is either according to a power-law or a stretched exponential, depending on the
tails of the dispersal kernel. More importantly, we provide a full
time-dependent description of the convergence to the asymptotic behavior which
can be anomalously slow and is needed even for long times. Our results also
apply to spreading dynamics on networks with a spectrum of long-range links
under certain conditions on the probabilities of long distance travel and are
thus relevant for the spread of epidemics.

Without imaging, a single BEC could be produced in 953 ms. The system uses an
atom chip to confine atoms in a dimple trap with frequencies exceeding 1 kHz.
With this tight trap, the duration of evaporative cooling was reduced to less

modifying the valley degrees of freedom associated with these quantum

quantum mechanical valley interference patterns associated with linear

the building's thermal properties, local weather predictions, and a self-tuning
stochastic occupancy model to reduce energy consumption while maintaining
occupant comfort. Contrasting with existing approaches, the occupancy model
requires no manual training and adapts to changes in occupancy patterns during
operation. A prediction-weighted cost function provides conditioning of thermal
zones before occupancy begins and reduces system output before occupancy ends.
Simulation results with real-world occupancy data demonstrate the algorithm's

microns) from the gas phase interstellar medium have long been attributed to
polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). A significant portion (10%-20%) of the
Milky Way's carbon reservoir is locked in PAH molecules, which makes their
characterization integral to our understanding of astrochemistry. In molecular
clouds and the dense envelopes and disks of young stellar objects (YSOs), PAHs
are expected to be frozen in the icy mantles of dust grains where they should
reveal themselves through infrared absorption. To facilitate the search for
frozen interstellar PAHs, laboratory experiments were conducted to determine
the positions and strengths of the bands of pyrene mixed with H2O and D2O ices.
The D2O mixtures are used to measure pyrene bands that are masked by the strong
bands of H2O, leading to the first laboratory determination of the band
strength for the CH stretching mode of pyrene in water ice near 3.25 microns.
Our infrared band strengths were normalized to experimentally determined
ultraviolet band strengths, and we find that they are generally ~50% larger
than those reported by Bouwman et al. based on theoretical strengths. These
improved band strengths were used to reexamine YSO spectra published by Boogert
et al. to estimate the contribution of frozen PAHs to absorption in the 5-8
micron spectral region, taking into account the strength of the 3.25 micron CH
stretching mode. It is found that frozen neutral PAHs contain 5%-9% of the
cosmic carbon budget, and account for 2%-9% of the unidentified absorption in
the 5-8 micron region.

bifurcations of piecewise-smooth maps, where a fixed point collides with a
surface at which the map is nonsmooth. For the border-collision normal form in
two dimensions, a codimension-three scenario was described in previous work at
which the map has a saddle-type periodic solution and an infinite sequence of
stable periodic solutions that limit to a homoclinic orbit of the saddle-type
solution. This paper introduces an alternate scenario of the same map at which
there is an infinite sequence of stable periodic solutions due to the presence
of a repeated unit eigenvalue in the linearization of some iterate of the map.
It is shown that this scenario is codimension-four and that the sequence of
periodic solutions is unbounded, aligning with eigenvectors corresponding to
the unit eigenvalue.
  Arbitrarily many attracting periodic solutions coexist near either scenario.
It is shown that if $K$ denotes the number of attracting periodic solutions,
and $\varepsilon$ denotes the distance in parameter space from one of the two
scenarios, then in the codimension-three case $\varepsilon$ scales with
$\lambda^{-K}$, where $\lambda > 1$ denotes the unstable stability multiplier
associated with the saddle-type periodic solution, and in the codimension-four
case $\varepsilon$ scales with $K^{-2}$. Since $K^{-2}$ decays significantly
slower than $\lambda^{-K}$, large numbers of attracting periodic solutions
coexist in open regions of parameter space extending substantially further from
the codimension-four scenarios than the codimension-three scenarios.

low-dimensional subspace of the parameter space. We present a dimension
reduction approach that defines and identifies such a subspace, called the
""likelihood-informed subspace"" (LIS), by characterizing the relative influences
of the prior and the likelihood over the support of the posterior distribution.
This identification enables new and more efficient computational methods for
Bayesian inference with nonlinear forward models and Gaussian priors. In
particular, we approximate the posterior distribution as the product of a
lower-dimensional posterior defined on the LIS and the prior distribution
marginalized onto the complementary subspace. Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling
can then proceed in lower dimensions, with significant gains in computational
efficiency. We also introduce a Rao-Blackwellization strategy that
de-randomizes Monte Carlo estimates of posterior expectations for additional
variance reduction. We demonstrate the efficiency of our methods using two

gravitational wave parameter estimation. Although a limitation of the FM has
been well known, it is still mainly used due to its very low computational cost
compared to the Monte Carlo simulations. Recently, Rodriguez et al. [Phys. Rev.
D 88, 084013 (2013)] performed Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulations for
nonspinning binary systems with total masses $M \leq 20 M_{\odot}$, they found
systematic differences between the predictions from FM and MCMC for $M>10
M_{\odot}$. On the other hand, an effective Fisher matrix (eFM) was recently
introduced by Cho et al. [Phys. Rev. D 87, 24004 (2013)]. The eFM is a
semi-analytic approach to the standard FM, in which the partial derivative is
taken by a quadratic fitting function to the local overlap surface. In this
work, we apply the eFM method to several nonspinning binary systems and find
that the error bounds in eFM are qualitatively in good agreement with the MCMC
results of Rodriguez et al. in all mass regions. In particular, we provide
concrete examples showing an importance of taking into account the
template-dependent frequency cutoff of the inspiral waveforms.

decades due to its ability of unveiling information latent in hyperspectral
data. Unfortunately, most existing methods fail to take advantage of the
spatial information in data. To overcome this limitation, we propose a
Structured Sparse regularized Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (SS-NMF) method
from the following two aspects. First, we incorporate a graph Laplacian to
encode the manifold structures embedded in the hyperspectral data space. In
this way, the highly similar neighboring pixels can be grouped together.
Second, the lasso penalty is employed in SS-NMF for the fact that pixels in the
same manifold structure are sparsely mixed by a common set of relevant bases.
These two factors act as a new structured sparse constraint. With this
constraint, our method can learn a compact space, where highly similar pixels
are grouped to share correlated sparse representations. Experiments on real
hyperspectral data sets with different noise levels demonstrate that our method
outperforms the state-of-the-art methods significantly.

been formulated quantitively as an inequality, e.g., by Englert and Jaeger,
Shimony, and Vaidman, which upper bounds the sum of the interference visibility
and the path distinguishability. Such wave-particle duality relations (WPDRs)
are often thought to be conceptually inequivalent to Heisenberg's uncertainty
principle, although this has been debated. Here we show that WPDRs correspond
precisely to a modern formulation of the uncertainty principle in terms of
entropies, namely the min- and max-entropies. This observation unifies two
fundamental concepts in quantum mechanics. Furthermore, it leads to a robust
framework for deriving novel WPDRs by applying entropic uncertainty relations
to interferometric models. As an illustration, we derive a novel relation that

since it is the main point of link between bulk power and consumers. A planned
and effective distribution network is the key to cope up with the ever
increasing demand for domestic, industrial and commercial load. The load-flow
study of radial distribution network is of prime importance for effective
planning of load transfers. Power companies are interested in finding the most
efficient configuration for minimization of real power loses and load balancing
among distribution feeders to save energy and enhance the over all performance
of distribution system.
  This thesis presents a fast and efficient method for load-flow analysis of
radial distribution networks. The proposed method is based on linear data
structure. The order of time and space complexity is reported here. There is
significant saving in no. of steps execution. Using graph theory concept and
exploiting multi-cores architecture, the proposed method for load flow can be
further investigated for obtaining more optimized solutions.

series by investigating their accompanying complex networks. In this work, we
investigate the fundamental topological and fractal properties of recurrence
networks constructed from fractional Brownian motions (FBMs). First, our
results indicate that the constructed recurrence networks have exponential
degree distributions; the relationship between $H$ and $<\lambda>$ can be
represented by a cubic polynomial function. We next focus on the motif rank
distribution of recurrence networks, so that we can better understand networks
at the local structure level. We find the interesting superfamily phenomenon,
i.e. the recurrence networks with the same motif rank pattern being grouped
into two superfamilies. Last, we numerically analyze the fractal and
multifractal properties of recurrence networks. We find that the average
fractal dimension $<d_{B}>$ of recurrence networks decreases with the Hurst
index $H$ of the associated FBMs, and their dependence approximately satisfies
the linear formula $<d_{B}> \approx 2 - H$. Moreover, our numerical results of
multifractal analysis show that the multifractality exists in these recurrence
networks, and the multifractality of these networks becomes stronger at first
and then weaker when the Hurst index of the associated time series becomes
larger from 0.4 to 0.95. In particular, the recurrence network with the Hurst
index $H=0.5$ possess the strongest multifractality. In addition, the
dependence relationships of the average information dimension $<D(1)>$ and the
average correlation dimension $<D(2)>$ on the Hurst index $H$ can also be
fitted well with linear functions. Our results strongly suggest that the
recurrence network inherits the basic characteristic and the fractal nature of
the associated FBM series.

events whose signature is the formation of circumstellar envelopes (CSE).
Planck multi-frequency measurements have provided relevant information on a
sample of Galactic planetary nebulae (PNe) in the important and relatively
unexplored observational band between 30 and 857GHz. Planck enables the
assembly of comprehensive PNe spectral energy distributions (SEDs) from radio
{\bf to} far-infrared frequencies. Modelling of the derived SEDs provides us
with information on physical properties of CSEs and the mass content of both
main components: ionised gas, traced by the free-free emission at cm--mm waves;
and thermal dust, traced by the millimetre and far-IR emission. In particular,
the amount of ionised gas and dust has been derived here. Such quantities have
also been estimated for the very young PN CRL618, where the strong variability
observed in its radio and millimetre emission has previously prevented the
construction of its SED. A morphological study of the Helix Nebula has also
been performed. Planck maps reveal, for the first time, the spatial
distribution of the dust inside the envelope, allowing us to identify different
components, the most interesting of which is a very extended component (up to
1pc) that may be related to a region where the slow expanding envelope is
interacting with the surrounding interstellar medium.

In lower vertebrates
such as frogs and turtles, due to the active mechanism in hair cells, hair
bundles(stereocilia) can be spontaneously oscillating or quiescent. Recently,
the amplitude death phenomenon has been proposed [K.-H. Ahn, J. R. Soc.
Interface, {\bf 10}, 20130525 (2013)] as a mechanism for auditory transduction
in frog hair-cell bundles, where sudden cessation of the oscillations arises
due to the coupling between non-identical hair bundles. The gating of the ion
channel is intrinsically stochastic due to the stochastic nature of the
configuration change of the channel. The strength of the noise due to the
channel gating can be comparable to the thermal Brownian noise of hair bundles.
Thus, we perform stochastic simulations of the elastically coupled hair
bundles. In spite of stray noisy fluctuations due to its stochastic dynamics,
our simulation shows the transition from collective oscillation to amplitude
death as inter-bundle coupling strength increases. In its stochastic dynamics,
the formation of the amplitude death state of coupled hair bundles can be seen
as a sudden suppression of the displacement fluctuation of the hair bundles as
the coupling strength increases. The enhancement of the signal-to-noise ratio
through the amplitude death phenomenon is clearly seen in the stochastic
dynamics. Our numerical results demonstrate that the multiple number of
transduction channels per hair bundle is an important factor to the amplitude
death phenomenon, because the phenomenon may disappear for a small number of
transduction channels due to strong gating noise.

However, a compound present in the sample typically produces several spectral

spectrometer device. In this work, we investigate the extent to which these
additional peaks can be used to increase the statistical strength of
differential analysis.
  We present a Bayesian approach for integrating data of multiple detected
peaks that come from one compound. We demonstrate the approach through a
simulated experiment and validate it on ultra performance liquid
chromatography-mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS) experiments for metabolomics and
lipidomics. Peaks that are likely to be associated with one compound can be
clustered by the similarity of their chromatographic shape. Changes of
concentration between sample groups can be inferred more accurately when
multiple peaks are available.
  When the sample-size is limited, the proposed multi-peak approach improves
the accuracy at inferring covariate effects. An R implementation, data and the

and the superconducting states. This is done using a dc Superconducting Quantum
Interference Device (dc SQUID) with two Josephson junctions in parallel with
the device under investigation and three contacts. As a demonstration we
measure the current-phase relation and $dI/dV$ of a small Josephson junction
and a carbon nanotube junction. In this latter case, in a regime where the
nanotube is well conducting, we show that the non-sinusoidal current phase
relation we find is consistent with the theory for a weak link, using the
transmission extracted from the differential conductance in the normal state.
This method holds great promise for future investigations of the current-phase
relation of more exotic junctions.

nanocrystalline anatase TiO2 with a majority (101) surface exposed. Generally
the sensitising dye employs a carboxylic anchoring moiety through which it
adheres to the TiO2 surface. Recent interest in exploiting the properties of
differing TiO2 electrode morphologies, such as rutile nanorods exposing the
(110) surface and anatase electrodes with high percentages of the (001) surface
exposed, begs the question of whether this anchoring strategy is best,
irrespective of the majority surface exposed. Here we address this question by
presenting density functional theory calculations contrasting the binding
properties of two promising anchoring groups, phosphonic acid and boronic acid,
to that of carboxylic acid. Anchor-electrode interactions are studied for the
pro- totypical anatase (101) surface, along with the anatase (001) and rutile
(110) surfaces. Finally the effect of using these alternative anchoring groups
to bind a typical coumarin dye (NKX- 2311) to these TiO2 substrates is
examined. Significant differences in the binding properties are found depending
on both the anchor and surface, illustrating that the choice of anchor is
necessarily dependent upon the surface exposed in the electrode. In particular
the boronic acid is found to show the potential to be an excellent anchor
choice for electrodes exposing the anatase (001) surface.

two orbital states are represented by two different (meta-)stable electronic

the two separate orbitals is mediated by the contact interaction between atoms,

find the system to be SU(N)-symmetric within our measurement precision and
characterize all relevant scattering channels for atom pairs in combinations of
the ground and the excited state. Elastic scattering between the orbitals is
dominated by the antisymmetric channel, which leads to the strong spin-exchange
coupling. The exchange process is directly observed, by characterizing the
dynamic equilibration of spin imbalances between two large ensembles in the two
orbital states, as well as indirectly in atom pairs via interaction shift
spectroscopy in a 3D lattice. The realization of a stable SU(N)-symmetric

projects were analysed. They have an overlapping time base of 1566 d and 2545
d, respectively. Six statistically significant peaks were identified (f1 =
1.410 116 c/d, f2 = 1.283 986 c/d, f3 = 1.293 210 c/d, f4 = 1.536 662 c/d, f5 =
1.157 22 c/d and f6 = 0.226 57 c/d). The spacing between f1 and f2, f1 and f4,
f5 and f2 is almost identical. Since the daily aliasing is very strong, the
interpretation of frequency spectra is somewhat ambiguous. From spectroscopic
data, we deduce a high rotational velocity (250+-25 km/s) and a metal
deficiency of about -0.8 to -1.1 dex compared to the Sun. A comparison with the
similar star, HR 8799, results in analogous pulsational characteristics but
widely different astrophysical parameters. Since both are lambda Bootis-type
stars, the main mechanism of this phenomenon, selective accretion, may severely
influence gamma Doradus-type pulsations.

research topic nowadays. Using subliminal information of speech, denominated as
prosody, it is possible to recognize the emotional state of the person. One of
the main problems in the design of automatic emotion recognition systems is the
small number of available patterns. This fact makes the learning process more
difficult, due to the generalization problems that arise under these
conditions. In this work we propose a solution to this problem consisting in
enlarging the training set through the creation the new virtual patterns. In
the case of emotional speech, most of the emotional information is included in
speed and pitch variations. So, a change in the average pitch that does not
modify neither the speed nor the pitch variations does not affect the expressed
emotion. Thus, we use this prior information in order to create new patterns
applying a gender dependent pitch shift modification in the feature extraction
process of the classification system. For this purpose, we propose a frequency
scaling modification of the Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients, used to
classify the emotion. For this purpose, we propose a gender dependent frequency
scaling modification. This proposed process allows us to synthetically increase
the number of available patterns in the training set, thus increasing the
generalization capability of the system and reducing the test error. Results
carried out with two different classifiers with different degree of
generalization capability demonstrate the suitability of the proposal.

fundamental idea behind the algorithm is to learn a sparse representation in

each small database. In the second phase, the dictionaries are merged to form a
global dictionary. We show that the proposed algorithm is efficient in its

which is temporally oscillating with the frequency equal to a frequency of
transition between gravitational states of antihydrogen. A corresponding
resonant change in the spatial density of antihydrogen atoms could be measured
as a function of the frequency of applied field. We estimate an accuracy of
measuring antihydrogen gravitational states spacing and show how a value of the

interactions (DFT+U) calculations are presented on Aluminium doping in bulk
TiO$_2$ and the anatase (101) surface. Particular attention is paid to the
mobility of oxygen vacancies throughout the doped TiO$_2$ lattice, as a means
by which charge compensation of trivalent dopants can occur. The effect that Al
doping of TiO$_2$ electrodes has in dye sensitised solar cells is explained as
a result of this mobility and charge compensation. Substitutional defects in
which one Al3+ replaces one Ti4+ are found to introduce valence band holes,
while intrinsic oxygen vacancies are found to introduce states in the band-gap.
Coupling two of these substitutional defects with an oxygen vacancy results in
exothermic defect formation which maintain charge neutrality. Nudged elastic
band calculations have been performed to investigate the formation of these
clustered defects in the (101) surface by oxygen vacancy diffusion, with the
resulting potential energy surface suggesting energetic gains with small
diffusion barriers. Efficiency in- creases observed in dye sensitised solar
cells as a result of aluminium doping of TiO$_2$ electrodes are investigated by
adsorbing the tetrahydroquinoline C2-1 chromophore on the defective surfaces.
Adsorption on the clustered extrinsic Al3+ and intrinsic oxygen vacancy defects
are found to behave as if adsorbed on a clean surface, with vacancy states not
present, while adsorption on the oxygen vacancy results in a down shift of the
dye localised states within the band-gap and defect states being present below
the conduction band edge. Aluminium doping therefore acts as a benign dopant
for 'cleaning' TiO$_2$ through oxygen vacancy diffusion.

as low as 300 ppt were detected with an ultimate detection limit of tens of

provided the mass-accretion rate is high enough to avoid nova eruptions. The
accretion regimes that allow growth of the WDs are usually calculated assuming
constant mass-transfer rates. However, it is possible that these systems are
influenced by effects that cause the rate to fluctuate on various timescales.
We investigate how long-term mass-transfer variability affects accreting WDs
systems. We show that, if such variability is present, it expands the parameter
space of binaries where the WD can effectively increase its mass. Furthermore,
we find that the supernova type Ia (SNIa) rate is enhanced by a factor 2-2.5 to
a rate that is comparable with the lower limit of the observed rates. The
changes in the delay-time distribution allow for more SNIae in stellar
populations with ages of a few Gyr. Thus, mass-transfer variability gives rise
to a new formation channel of SNIa events that can significantly contribute to
the SNIa rate. Mass-transfer variability is also likely to affect other binary
populations through enhanced WD growth. For example, it may explain why WDs in
cataclysmic variables are observed to be more massive than single WDs, on
average.

coherence rephasing in an inhomogeneously broadened ensemble of three-level

pulse are stored as spin coherences at an intermediate time interval, and are
rephased for echo emission when the ensemble is returned to the initial state.
Echo emission during a possible partial rephasing when the medium is inverted
can be suppressed with an appropriate choice of control pulse wavevectors. We
demonstrate that the scheme works in an optically dense ensemble, despite

result to the closest rank-deficient matrix. We propose a single-step method
that solves both steps of the eight-point algorithm. Using recent results from
polynomial global optimization, our method finds the rank-deficient matrix that
exactly minimizes the algebraic cost. In this special case, the optimization
method is reduced to the resolution of very short sequences of convex linear
problems which are computationally efficient and numerically stable. The
current gold standard is known to be extremely effective but is nonetheless
outperformed by our rank-constrained method for bootstrapping bundle
adjustment. This is here demonstrated on simulated and standard real datasets.
With our initialization, bundle adjustment consistently finds a better local
minimum (achieves a lower reprojection error) and takes less iterations to
converge.

bursting neurons in the frequency domain. Instantaneous population firing rate
(IPFR) $R(t)$, which is directly obtained from the raster plot of neural
spikes, is often used as a realistic collective quantity describing population
activities in both the computational and the experimental neuroscience. For the
case of spiking neurons, a realistic time-domain order parameter, based on
$R(t)$, was introduced in our recent work to characterize the spike
synchronization transition. Unlike the case of spiking neurons, the IPFR $R(t)$
of bursting neurons exhibits population behaviors with both the slow bursting
and the fast spiking timescales. For our aim, we decompose the IPFR $R(t)$ into
the instantaneous population bursting rate $R_b(t)$ (describing the bursting
behavior) and the instantaneous population spike rate $R_s(t)$ (describing the
spiking behavior) via frequency filtering, and extend the realistic order
parameter to the case of bursting neurons. Thus, we develop the
frequency-domain bursting and spiking order parameters which are just the
bursting and spiking ""coherence factors"" $\beta_b$ and $\beta_s$ of the
bursting and spiking peaks in the power spectral densities of $R_b$ and $R_s$
(i.e., ""signal to noise"" ratio of the spectral peak height and its relative
width). Through calculation of $\beta_b$ and $\beta_s$, we obtain the bursting
and spiking thresholds beyond which the burst and spike synchronizations break
up, respectively. Consequently, it is shown in explicit examples that the
frequency-domain bursting and spiking order parameters may be usefully used for
characterization of the bursting and the spiking transitions, respectively.

high-energy astroparticle detectors, with a view towards next-generation
facilities. The atmosphere is an integral component of many high-energy
astroparticle detectors. Imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes and
cosmic-ray extensive air shower detectors are the two instruments driving the
rapidly evolving fields of very-high- and ultra-high-energy astrophysics. In
these instruments, the atmosphere is used as a giant calorimeter where cosmic
rays and gamma rays deposit their energy and initiate EASs; it is also the
medium through which the resulting Cherenkov light propagates. Uncertainties in
real-time atmospheric conditions and in the fixed atmospheric models typically
dominate all other systematic errors. With the improved sensitivity of upgraded
IACTs such as H.E.S.S.-II and MAGIC-II and future facilities like the Cherenkov
Telescope Array (CTA) and JEM-EUSO, statistical uncertainties are expected to
be significantly reduced, leaving the atmosphere as the limiting factor in the
determination of astroparticle spectra. Varying weather conditions necessitate
the development of suitable atmospheric monitoring to be integrated in the
overall instrument calibration, including Monte Carlo simulations. With
expertise distributed across multiple collaborations and scientific domains, an
interdisciplinary workshop is being convened to advance progress on this
critical and timely topic.

define the direction of the corresponding Wilson line operators. The infinite
Wilson lines are first regularized to prove the correctness of the method. We
have implemented the method in a computer FORM program that can calculate
gluonic matrix elements of Wilson line operators automatically. In addition we
formulate the Feynman rules that are convenient in certain applications, e.g.
proving the Ward identities. Using both the program and the Feynman rules we
calculate a few examples, in particular the matrix elements corresponding to
gauge invariant $g^{*}g^{*}g^{*}g$ and $g^{*}g^{*}g^{*}g^{*}g$ processes. An
immediate application of the approach is in the high energy scattering, as in a
special kinematic setup our results reduce to the form directly related to
Lipatov's vertices. Thus the results we present can be directly transformed
into Lipatov's vertices, in particular into $RRRP$ and $RRRRP$ vertices with
arbitrary ""orientation"" of reggeized gluons. Since the formulation itself is
not restricted to high-energy scattering, we also apply the method to a
decomposition of an ordinary on-shell amplitude into a set of gauge invariant
objects.

the crucial ingredient for the dynamics. The wide spectrum of unstable

$\mu_{R}(G)$ shares a lot of properties with the group algebra $RG$ however,
there are some differences. For example, the group algebra is a symmetric
algebra and this is not always the case for the Mackey algebra. In this paper
we present a systematic approach to the question of the symmetricity of the
Mackey algebra, by producing symmetric associative bilinear forms for the
Mackey algebra. The category of Mackey functors is a closed symmetric monoidal
category, so using the formalism of J.P. May for these categories, S. Bouc has
defined the so-called Burnside trace. Using this Burnside trace we produce
trace maps for Mackey algebras which generalize the usual trace map the group
algebras. These trace maps factorise through Burnside algebras. We prove that
the Mackey algebra $\mu_{R}(G)$ is a symmetric algebra if and only if the
family of Burnside algebras $(RB(H))_{H\leqslant G}$ is a family of symmetric
algebras with a compatibility condition. As a corollary, we recover the well
known fact that over a field of characteristic zero, the Mackey algebra is
always symmetric. Over the ring of integers the Mackey algebra of $G$ is
symmetric if and only if the order of $G$ is square free. Finally, over a field
of characteristic $p>0$ we show that the Mackey algebra is symmetric if and
only if the Sylow $p$-subgroups of $G$ are of order $1$ or $p$.

complex system composed of interacting units is usually attempted by using
statistical similarity measures, such as Cross-Correlation (CC) and Mutual
Information (MI). The possible existence of a direct link between different
units is, however, hindered within the time-series measurements. Here we show
that, for the class of systems studied, when an abrupt change in the ordered
set of CC or MI values exists, it is possible to infer, without errors, the
underlying network topology from the time-series measurements, even in the
presence of observational noise, non-identical units, and coupling
heterogeneity. We find that a necessary condition for the discontinuity to
occur is that the dynamics of the coupled units is partially coherent, i.e.,
neither complete disorder nor globally synchronous patterns are present. We
critically compare the inference methods based on CC and MI, in terms of how
effective, robust, and reliable they are, and conclude that, in general, MI
outperforms CC in robustness and reliability. Our findings could be relevant
for the construction and interpretation of functional networks, such as those
constructed from brain or climate data.

properties of the connected odd-bipartite hypergraphs. We prove that the
Laplacian H-spectrum and signless Laplacian H-spectrum of a connected
$k$-uniform hypergraph $G$ are equal if and only if $k$ is even and $G$ is
odd-bipartite. We further give several spectral characterizations of the
connected odd-bipartite hypergraphs. We also give a characterization for a
connected $k$-uniform hypergraph whose Laplacian spectral radius and signless
Laplacian spectral radius are equal, thus provide an answer to a question
raised in [9]. By showing that the Cartesian product $G\Box H$ of two
odd-bipartite $k$-uniform hypergraphs is still odd-bipartite, we determine that
the Laplacian spectral radius of $G\Box H$ is the sum of the Laplacian spectral
radii of $G$ and $H$, when $G$ and $H$ are both connected odd-bipartite.

studied by the kinetic Monte Carlo simulation method. Change in the character
of step instability is analyzed for different rates of particle jumps towards
step. In the experiment effective value of jump rates can be controlled by
impurities or other growth conditions. An anisotropy of jump barriers at the
step influences the character of surface structure formed in the process of
crystal growth. Depending on the growth parameters different surface patterns
are found. We show phase diagrams of surface patterns as a function of
temperature and crystal growth rate for two different choices of step kinetics
anisotropy. Jump rates which effectively model high inverse Schwoebel barrier
(ISB) at steps lead either to regular, four-multistep or bunched structure. For
weak anisotropy at higher temperatures or for lower crystal growth rates
meanders and mounds are formed, but on coming towards lower temperatures and
higher rates we observe bunch and meander coexistence. These results show that
interplay between simple dynamical mechanisms induced by the asymmetry of the
step kinetics and step movement assisted by the step edge diffusion are
responsible for different types of surface morphology.

ETGs than previously available. We first recalibrate (based on WISE data) the
relation between old stellar populations (traced at Ks-band) and 22um
luminosity, allowing us to remove the contribution of 22um emission from
circumstellar dust. We then go on to investigate the position of ETGs on the
Kennicutt-Schmidt (KS) relation. Molecular gas-rich ETGs have comparable star
formation surface densities to normal spiral galaxy centres, but they lie
systematically offset from the KS relation, having lower star formation
efficiencies by a factor of ~2.5 (in agreement with other authors). This effect
is driven by galaxies where a substantial fraction of the molecular material is
in the rising part of the rotation curve, and shear is high. We show here for
the first time that although the number of stars formed per unit gas mass per
unit time is lower in ETGs, it seems that the amount of stars formed per
free-fall time is approximately constant. The scatter around this dynamical
relation still correlates with galaxy properties such as the shape of the
potential in the inner regions. This leads us to suggest that dynamical
properties (such as shear or the global stability of the gas) may be important
second parameters that regulate star formation and cause much of the scatter
around star-formation relations.

filter algorithm with various parameters applied on an image of RGB model. Oil
Paint image processing, being very performance hungry, current research tries
to find improvement using parallel pattern library. With increasing
kernel-size, the processing time of oil paint image filter algorithm increases
exponentially.
