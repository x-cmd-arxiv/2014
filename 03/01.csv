convex optimiza- tion problems using first-order information where the
underlying function includes high-dimensional data. The primary aim is to
develop an implementable algorithmic framework for solving problems with multi-
term composite objective functions involving linear mappings using the optimal
subgradient algorithm, OSGA, proposed by Neumaier in [49]. To this end, we
propose some prox-functions for which the cor- responding subproblem of OSGA is
solved in a closed form. Considering various inverse problems arising in signal
and image processing, machine learning, statistics, we report extensive
numerical and compar- isons with several state-of-the-art solvers proposing
favourably performance of our algorithm. We also compare with the most widely
used optimal first-order methods for some smooth and nonsmooth con- vex
problems. Surprisingly, when some Nesterov-type optimal methods originally
proposed for smooth problems are adapted for solving nonsmooth problems by
simply passing a subgradient instead of the gradient, the results of these
subgradient-based algorithms are competitive and totally interesting for
solving nonsmooth problems. Finally, the OSGA software package is available.

splitting of the common wireless cellular resources between uplink (UL) and
downlink (DL) users. In this paper, the UL/DL optimization problem is
formulated as a noncooperative game among the small cell base stations (SCBSs)
in which each base station aims at minimizing its total UL and DL flow delays.
To solve this game, a self-organizing UL/DL resource configuration scheme for
TDD-based small cell networks is proposed. Using the proposed scheme, an SCBS
is able to estimate and learn the UL and DL loads autonomously while optimizing
its UL/DL configuration accordingly. Simulations results show that the proposed
algorithm achieves significant gains in terms of packet throughput in case of
asymmetric UL and DL traffic loads. This gain increases as the traffic
asymmetry increases, reaching up to 97% and 200% gains relative to random and
fixed duplexing schemes respectively. Our results also show that the proposed
algorithm is well- adapted to dynamic traffic conditions and different network
sizes, and operates efficiently in case of severe cross-link interference in
which neighboring cells transmit in opposite directions.

  Edge-Congestion","30 pages, 8 figures",,,,"cs.DM math.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We study the problem of embedding a guest graph with minimum edge-congestion
into a multidimensional grid with the same size as that of the guest graph.
Based on a well-known notion of graph separators, we show that an embedding
with a smaller edge-congestion can be obtained if the guest graph has a smaller
separator, and if the host grid has a higher but constant dimension.
Specifically, we prove that any graph with $N$ nodes, maximum node degree
$\Delta$, and with a node-separator of size $O(n^\alpha)$ ($0\leq\alpha<1$) can
be embedded into a grid of a fixed dimension $d\geq 2$ with at least $N$ nodes,
with an edge-congestion of $O(\Delta)$ if $d>1/(1-\alpha)$, $O(\Delta\log N)$
if $d=1/(1-\alpha)$, and $O(\Delta N^{\alpha-1+\frac{1}{d}})$ if $d<
1/(1-\alpha)$. This edge-congestion achieves constant ratio approximation if
$d>1/(1-\alpha)$, and matches an existential lower bound within a constant
factor if $d\leq 1/(1-\alpha)$. Our result implies that if the guest graph has
an excluded minor of a fixed size, such as a planar graph, then we can obtain
an edge-congestion of $O(\Delta\log N)$ for $d=2$ and $O(\Delta)$ for any fixed
$d\geq 3$. Moreover, if the guest graph has a fixed treewidth, such as a tree,
an outerplanar graph, and a series-parallel graph, then we can obtain an
edge-congestion of $O(\Delta)$ for any fixed $d\geq 2$. To design our embedding
algorithm, we introduce edge-separators bounding expansion, such that in
partitioning a graph into isolated nodes using edge-separators recursively, the
number of outgoing edges from a subgraph to be partitioned in a recursive step
is bounded. We present an algorithm to construct an edge-separator with
expansion of $O(\Delta n^\alpha)$ from a node-separator of size $O(n^\alpha)$.

turns out that the bulk of H${}_{2}$O in a planet's interior may exist in
various states such as plasma, superionic, ionic, Ice VII, Ice X, etc.,

circle $S^1$, a $C^1$ function $A:S^1 \to \mathbb{R}$, and, the map $F(x,s) = (
T(x) , \lambda \, s + A(x))$, $(x,s)\in S^1 \times \mathbb{R}$. We denote
$\mathcal{B}= \mathcal{B}_\lambda$ the upper boundary of the attractor (known
as fat attractor). We are interested in the regularity of
$\mathcal{B}_\lambda$, and, also in what happens in the limit when $\lambda\to
1$. We also address the analysis of the following conjecture which were
proposed by R. Bam\'on, J. Kiwi, J. Rivera-Letelier and R. Urz\'ua: for any
fixed $\lambda$, $C^1$ generically on the potential $A$, the upper boundary
$\mathcal{B}_\lambda$ is formed by a finite number of pieces of smooth unstable
manifolds of periodic orbits for $F$. We show the proof of the conjecture for
the class of $C^2$ potentials $A(x)$ satisfying the twist condition (plus a
combinatorial condition). We do not need the generic hypothesis for this
result. We present explicit examples. On the other hand, when $\lambda$ is
close to $1$ and the potential $A$ is generic a more precise description can be
done. In this case the finite number of pieces of $C^1$ curves on the boundary
have some special properties. Having a finite number of pieces on this boundary
is an important issue in a problem related to semi-classical limits and
micro-support. This was consider in a recent published work by A. Lopes and J.
Mohr. Finally, we present the general analysis of the case where $A$ is
Lipschitz and its relation with Ergodic Transport

that the apparently separated inner and outer spirals can be interpreted as a

to classical interferometry. It can be used to observe gravitational lenses
that cannot be detected with standard techniques. It can be used to carry out
very long baseline interferometry. Although the original theoretical analysis,
that uses wave interaction effects, is rigorous, it is not easy to understand.
The present article therefore carries out a simpler analysis, using the
autocorrelation of intensity fluctuations, which is easier to understand. It is
based on published experiments that were carried out to validate the original
theory. The autocorrelation analysis also validates simple numerical
techniques, based on the autocorrelation, to model the angular intensity
distribution of a source. The autocorrelation technique also allows a much
simpler detection of the signal.
  In practice, the gravitational lens applications are the ones that can
readily be done with presently available telescopes. We describe a practical
example that shows that presently available VLBI radio-astronomical data can be
used to observe microlensisng and millilensing in macrolensed Quasars. They may

dynamical ejecta are appreciably shock-heated and neutrino-processed, resulting
in a wide range of Y_e (= 0.09-0.45). The mass-averaged abundance distribution
of calculated nucleosynthesis yields is in reasonable agreement with the
full-mass range (A = 90-240) of the solar r-process curve. This implies, if our
model is representative of such events, that the dynamical ejecta of NS-NS

shows that the radioactive heating after ~ 1 day from the merging, giving rise
to r-process-powered transient emission, is dominated by the beta-decays of
several species close to stability with precisely measured half-lives. This

correctly infer individual edges, possess a number of appealing features
including invariance to rank-preserving transformation. However, regulation in
biological systems occurs on multiple scales and existing metrics do not take

novel performance scores are presented that share the appealing properties of

algorithm depends crucially on the scale at which inferences are to be made; in
particular strong local performance does not guarantee accurate reconstruction
of higher-order topology. Applying these scores to a large corpus of data from

superior local performance in the DREAM5 challenge, is also among the best

modern polarizers, but the bandwidth of this polarizer can be at least twice as

scalar gauge field, $B (x)$, in addition to the usual vector gauge field,
$A_\mu (x)$. We study this variant of the usual gauge procedure in the context
of a complex scalar, matter field $\phi (x)$ with a U(1) symmetry. We will
focus most on the case when $\phi$ develops a vacuum expectation value via
spontaneous symmetry breaking. We find that under these conditions the scalar
gauge field mixes with the Goldstone boson that arises from the breaking of a
global symmetry. Some other interesting features of this scalar gauge model
are: (i) The new gauge procedure gives rise to terms which violate C and CP
symmetries. This may have have applications in cosmology or for CP violation in
particle physics; (ii) the existence of mass terms in the Lagrangian which
respect the new extended gauge symmetry. Thus one can have gauge field mass
terms even in the absence of the usual Higgs mechanism; (iii) the emergence of
a sine-Gordon potential for the scalar gauge field; (iv) a natural, axion-like
suppression of the interaction strength of the scalar gauge boson.

star (behaving as a radio pulsar) and a normal donor star, evolving either to
helium white dwarf (HeWD) or ultra short orbital period systems. We consider
X-ray irradiation feedback and evaporation due to radio pulsar irradiation. We
show that irradiation feedback leads to cyclic mass transfer episodes, allowing
CBSs to be observed in-between as binary radio pulsars under conditions in
which standard, non-irradiated models predict the occurrence of a low mass
X-ray binary. This behavior accounts for the existence of a family of eclipsing
binary systems known as redbacks. We predict that redback companions should
almost fill their Roche lobe, as observed in PSR J1723-2837. This state is also
possible for systems evolving with larger orbital periods. Therefore, binary
radio pulsars with companion star masses usually interpreted as larger than
expected to produce HeWDs may also result in such {\it quasi - Roche Lobe
Overflow} states, rather than hosting a carbon-oxygen WD.
  We found that CBSs with initial orbital periods $\mathrm{P_{i}<1}$ day evolve
into redbacks. Some of them produce low mass HeWDs, and a subgroup with shorter
$\mathrm{P_{i}}$ become black widows (BWs). Thus, BWs descent from redbacks,
although not all redbacks evolve into BWs.
  There is mounting observational evidence favoring that BW pulsars are very
massive ($\mathrm{\gtrsim 2\; M_{\odot}}$). As they should be redback
descendants, redback pulsars should also be very massive, since most of the
mass is transferred before this stage.

evolution. Here we measure the IMF mass normalization for a sample of 68 field
galaxies in the redshift range 0.7 to 0.9 within the Extended Groth Strip. To
do this we derive total (stellar + dark matter) mass-to-light [$(M/L)_{\rm
dyn}$] using axisymmetric dynamical models. Within the region where we have
kinematics (about one half-light radius), the models assume: (i) that
mass-follows-light, implying negligible differences between the stellar and
total density profiles; (ii) constant velocity anisotropy ($\beta_{\rm
z}\equiv1-\sigma_z^2/\sigma_R^2=0.2$); (iii) that galaxies are seen at the
average inclination for random orientations (i.e. $i=60^\circ$, where
$i=90^\circ$ represents edge-on). The dynamical models are based on anisotropic
Jeans equations, constrained by HST/ACS imaging and the central velocity
dispersion of the galaxies, extracted from good-quality spectra taken by the
DEEP2 survey. The population $(M/L)_{\rm pop}$ are derived from full-spectrum
fitting of the same spectra with a grid of simple stellar population models.
Recent dynamical modelling results by the $ATLAS^{3D}$ project and numerical
simulations of galaxy evolution indicate that the dark matter fraction within
the central regions of our galaxies should be small. This suggest that our
derived total $(M/L)_{\rm dyn}$ should closely approximate the stellar $M/L$.
Our comparison of $(M/L)_{\rm dyn}$ and $(M/L)_{\rm pop}$ then imply that for
galaxies with stellar mass $M_\odot \geq 10^{11}$ $M_{\odot}$, the $average$
normalization of the IMF is consistent with a Salpeter slope, with a
substantial scatter. This is similar to what is found within a similar mass
range for nearby galaxies.

the finite interchain couplings. In this phase, we observe that excitations
have a sharp, resolution-limited line shape at low energies and over most of
the dispersion bandwidth, as expected for spin-flip quasiparticles. We map the
full bandwidth along the strongly dispersive chain direction and resolve clear
modulations of the dispersions in the plane normal to the chains,
characteristic of frustrated interchain couplings in an antiferromagnetic
isosceles triangular lattice. The dispersions can be well parametrized using a
linear spin-wave model that includes interchain couplings and further neighbor
exchanges. The observed dispersion bandwidth along the chain direction is
smaller than that predicted by a linear spin-wave model using exchange values
determined at zero field, and this effect is attributed to quantum
renormalization of the dispersion beyond the spin-wave approximation in fields
slightly above the critical field, where quantum fluctuations are still

simulations with trapped ions, the direct preparation of the ground state by
adiabatically ramping the field of a transverse field Ising model becomes more
and more difficult as the number of particles increase. We propose a
spectroscopy protocol that intentionally creates excitations through diabatic
ramping of the transverse field and measures a low-noise observable as a
function of time for a constant field to reveal the structure of the coherent
dynamics of the resulting many-body states. To simulate the experimental data,
noise from counting statistics and decoherence error are added. Compressive
sensing is then applied to Fourier transform the simulated data into the
frequency domain and extract the the low-lying energy excitation spectrum. By
using compressive sensing, the amount of data in time needed to extract this
energy spectrum is sharply reduced making such experiments feasible with
current technology.

the large N limit produces string moving in one space dimension, with

no bosonic worldsheet field (d=0). We study this model at finite N to assess
the role of the large N limit in the emergence of the spatial dimension. Our
results suggest that string-like states with large bit number M may not exist

also be the (approximate) emergence of a new spatial dimension. In string bit
models designed to produce critical superstring at N=infinity, we can then
expect only approximate Lorentz invariance at finite N, with violations of

the number of operations over the space of plane-waves is independent of the

solution. For reduced dimensional systems, reductions in computational cost,
compared to the plane-wave calculations, exceed 5x. Performance on bulk systems
improves by 1.67x in molecular dynamics-like contexts. This robust technique is
well-suited to efficient study of systems with strin- gent requirements on

(SMBHBs) with circumbinary gas disks: a sharp drop in flux blueward of the
Lyman limit. A prominent edge is produced if the gas dominating the emission in
the Lyman continuum region of the spectrum is sufficiently cold (T < 20,000 K)
to contain significant neutral hydrogen. Circumbinary disks may be in this
regime if the binary torques open a central cavity in the disk and clear most
of the hot gas from the inner region, and if any residual UV emission from the
individual BHs is either dim or intermittent. We model the vertical structure
and spectra of circumbinary disks using the radiative transfer code TLUSTY, and
identify the range of BH masses and binary separations producing a Lyman edge.
We find that compact supermassive binaries with orbital periods of ~0.1 - 10
yr, whose gravitational waves (GWs) are expected to be detectable by pulsar
timing arrays (PTAs), could have prominent Lyman edges. Such strong spectral
edge features are not typically present in AGN spectra and could serve as
corroborating evidence for the presence of a SMBHB.

well as by environment type: field galaxies, cluster members and brightest
cluster galaxies (BCGs). Remarkably, we find that radio AGNs exhibit on average
a 50% excess (17{\sigma} significance) in the number of satellites within 100
kpc even though the cluster membership was controlled for (e.g., radio BCGs
have more satellites than radio-quiet BCGs, etc.). Satellite excess is not
confirmed for high-excitation sources, which are only 2% of radio AGN. Extra
satellites may be responsible for raising the probability for hot gas AGN
accretion via tidal effects or may otherwise enhance the intensity or duration
of the radio-emitting phase. Furthermore, we find that the incidence of radio
AGNs among potential hosts (massive ellipticals) is similar for field galaxies
and for non-BCG cluster members, suggesting that AGN fueling depends primarily
on conditions in the host halo rather than the parent, cluster halo. Regarding
feedback, we find that radio AGNs, either high or low excitation, have no
detectable effect on star formation in their satellites, as neither induced
star formation nor star formation quenching is present in more than ~1% of
radio AGN.

star-formation rate density peaked approximately 3.5 Gyr after the Big Bang, at
z~1.9, and declined exponentially at later times, with an e-folding timescale
of 3.9 Gyr. Half of the stellar mass observed today was formed before a
redshift z = 1.3. About 25% formed before the peak of the cosmic star-formation
rate density, and another 25% formed after z = 0.7. Less than ~1% of today's
stars formed during the epoch of reionization. Under the assumption of a
universal initial mass function, the global stellar mass density inferred at
any epoch matches reasonably well the time integral of all the preceding
star-formation activity. The comoving rates of star formation and central black
hole accretion follow a similar rise and fall, offering evidence for
co-evolution of black holes and their host galaxies. The rise of the mean
metallicity of the Universe to about 0.001 solar by z = 6, one Gyr after the

amplification as in classical communication is impossible for quantum states.
This calls for more advanced techniques in a future global quantum network,
e.g. for cloud quantum computing. A unique solution is the teleportation of an
entangled state, i.e. entanglement swapping, representing the central resource
to relay entanglement between distant nodes. Together with entanglement
purification and a quantum memory it constitutes a so-called quantum repeater.
Since the aforementioned building blocks have been individually demonstrated in
laboratory setups only, the applicability of the required technology in
real-world scenarios remained to be proven. Here we present a free-space
entanglement-swapping experiment between the Canary Islands of La Palma and
Tenerife, verifying the presence of quantum entanglement between two previously
independent photons separated by 143 km. We obtained an expectation value for
the entanglement-witness operator, more than 6 standard deviations beyond the
classical limit. By consecutive generation of the two required photon pairs and
space-like separation of the relevant measurement events, we also showed the
feasibility of the swapping protocol in a long-distance scenario, where the
independence of the nodes is highly demanded. Since our results already allow
for efficient implementation of entanglement purification, we anticipate our
assay to lay the ground for a fully-fledged quantum repeater over a realistic
high-loss and even turbulent quantum channel.

characteristic is supersingular if it is isogenous to a product of
supersingular elliptic curves and is superspecial if it is isomorphic to a
product of supersingular elliptic curves. In this paper, the superspecial
condition is generalized by defining the superspecial rank of an abelian
variety, which is an invariant of its p-torsion. The main results in this paper
are about the superspecial rank of supersingular abelian varieties and
Jacobians of curves. For example, it turns out that the superspecial rank
determines information about the decomposition of a supersingular abelian
variety up to isomorphism; namely it is a bound for the maximal number of
supersingular elliptic curves appearing in such a decomposition.

Einstein's field equations for extended bodies: many structure-dependent terms
appear in intermediate calculations that cancel exactly in virtue of the local
equations of motion or can be eliminated by appropriate gauge transformations.
For a single body at rest these problems are well understood for both the
post-Newtonian and the post-Minkowskian cases. However, the situation is still
unclear for approximations of higher orders. This paper discusses this problem
for a ""body"" of spherical symmetry to post-linear order. We explicitly
demonstrate how the usual Schwarzschild field can be derived directly from the
field equations in the post-linear approximation in the harmonic gauge and for
an arbitrary spherically symmetric matter distribution. Both external and
internal solutions are considered. The case of static incompressible fluid is
then compared to the well-known results from the literature. The results of
this paper can be applied to generalize the well-known post-Newtonian and
post-Minkowskian multipole expansions of the metric in the post-linear
approximation.

This transition was associated to the thiol group ordering and the

energy difference among two thiol configurations was found to be
$-J=\varepsilon_{A}-\varepsilon_{B}=-66.6$ cal/mole. Besides, we conducted a
study of phonon and rotor contributions to the specific heat and we proposed a
generalization of Debye model. It was possible to evaluate the exponent of the
$g(\omega)$, leading to the result that it corresponds to the Debye model for
L-cysteine, which implies that the boson peak in this system is due to a
maximum in the $C_{coup}(\omega)$ and also that the plane wave of wave-vector
$\vec{q}$ is a good approximation to describe the phonons. On the other hand
the origin of the boson peak for L-cystine correlates to a peak in $g(\omega)$

parameters for modeling its explosion and subsequent evolution. Low frequency
(<100 MHz) radio observations of sufficient angular resolution offer a unique
probe of unshocked ejecta revealed via free-free absorption against the
synchrotron emitting shell. We have used the Very Large Array plus Pie Town
Link extension to probe this cool, ionized absorber at 9 arcseconds and 18.5
arcseconds resolution at 74 MHz. Together with higher frequency data we
estimate an electron density of 4.2 electrons per cubic centimeters and a total
mass of 0.39 Solar masses with uncertainties of a factor of about 2. This is a
significant improvement over the 100 electrons per cubic centimeter upper limit
offered by infrared [S III] line ratios from the Spitzer Space Telescope. Our
estimates are sensitive to a number of factors including temperature and
geometry. However using reasonable values for each, our unshocked mass estimate
agrees with predictions from dynamical models. We also consider the presence,
or absence, of cold iron- and carbon-rich ejecta and how these affect our
calculations. Finally we reconcile the intrinsic absorption from unshocked
ejecta with the turnover in Cas A's integrated spectrum documented decades ago
at much lower frequencies. These and other recent observations below 100 MHz
confirm that spatially resolved thermal absorption, when extended to lower
frequencies and higher resolution, will offer a powerful new tool for low

line from three HAEs and discovered a close pair of red and blue CO-emitting
HAEs. Given their close proximity (~30 kpc), small velocity offset (~300 km/s),
and similar stellar masses, they could be in the early phase of a gas-rich

ratio is significantly enhanced compared to local spirals and high-redshift
disks with a similar CO luminosity, which is indicative of a starburst mode. We
find the gas depletion timescale is shorter than that of normal star-forming

one direction and has a local minimum. We derive and present equations
governing the evolution of the envelope of flexural-gravity wave packets
allowing the flexing material to have small variations in the transverse (to
propagation) direction. We show that the governing equation belongs to the
general family of Davey-Stewartson equations, but with an extra term in the
surface evolution equation that accounts for the variable thickness of the
elastic cover. We then use an iterative Newton-Raphson scheme, with a numerical
continuation procedure via Lagrange interpolation, in a search to find
fully-localized solutions of this system of equations. We show that if the
elastic sheet thickness has (at least) a local minimum, flexural-gravity lumps
can propagate near the minimum thickness, and in general have an asymmetric
bell-shape in the transverse to the propagation direction. In applied physics,
flexural-gravity waves describe for instance propagation of waves over the
ice-covered bodies of water. Ice is seldom uniform, nor is the seafloor, and in
fact near the boundaries (ice-edges, shorelines) they typically vary only in
one direction (toward to edge), and are uniform in the transverse direction.
This research suggests that fully localized waves are not restricted to
constant ice-thickness/water-depth areas and can exist under much broader
conditions. Presented results may have implications in experimental generation

present a novel and efficient Bayesian framework that combines the results from

maximizing the information from the photometric data. To demonstrate this we
use a supervised machine learning technique based on random forest, an
unsupervised method based on self-organizing maps, and a standard template
fitting method but can be easily extend to other existing techniques. We use
data from the DEEP2 and the SDSS surveys to explore different methods for
combining the predictions from these techniques. By using different performance
metrics, we demonstrate that we can improve the accuracy of our final photo-$z$
estimate over the best input technique, that the fraction of outliers is
reduced, and that the identification of outliers is significantly improved when
we apply a Na\""{\i}ve Bayes Classifier to this combined information. Our more
robust and accurate photo-$z$ PDFs will allow even more precise cosmological
constraints to be made by using current and future photometric surveys. These
improvements are crucial as we move to analyze photometric data that push to or

expanded census of Tuc-Hor increases the known population by a factor of ~3 in

population of Tuc-Hor is still markedly incomplete. The spatial distribution of
members appears to trace a 2D sheet, with a broad distribution in X and Y, but
a very narrow distribution (+/-5 pc) in Z. The corresponding velocity
distribution is very small, with a scatter of +/-1.1 km/s about the mean UVW
velocity. We also show that the isochronal age (20--30 Myr) and the lithium
depletion age (40 Myr) disagree, following a trend seen in other PMS
populations. The Halpha emission follows a trend of increasing EW with later
SpT, as seen for young clusters. We find that members have been depleted of
lithium for spectral types of K7.0-M4.5. Finally, our purely kinematic and
color-magnitude selection procedure allows us to test the efficiency and
completeness for activity-based selection of young stars. We find that 60% of

single-output secondary communication systems with multiple system design
objectives. We consider cognitive radio networks where the secondary receivers
are able to harvest energy from the radio frequency when they are idle. The
secondary system provides simultaneous wireless power and secure information
transfer to the secondary receivers. We propose a multi-objective optimization
framework for the design of a Pareto optimal resource allocation algorithm
based on the weighted Tchebycheff approach. In particular, the algorithm design
incorporates three important system objectives: total transmit power
minimization, energy harvesting efficiency maximization, and interference power
leakage-to-transmit power ratio minimization. The proposed framework takes into
account a quality of service requirement regarding communication secrecy in the
secondary system and the imperfection of the channel state information of
potential eavesdroppers (idle secondary receivers and primary receivers) at the
secondary transmitter. The adopted multi-objective optimization problem is
non-convex and is recast as a convex optimization problem via semidefinite
programming (SDP) relaxation. It is shown that the global optimal solution of
the original problem can be constructed by exploiting both the primal and the
dual optimal solutions of the SDP relaxed problem. Besides, two suboptimal
resource allocation schemes for the case when the solution of the dual problem
is unavailable for constructing the optimal solution are proposed. Numerical
results not only demonstrate the close-to-optimal performance of the proposed
suboptimal schemes, but also unveil an interesting trade-off between the
considered conflicting system design objectives.

(UV) luminosity function (LF) of high-z galaxies taking into account in a
self-consistent way their chemical evolution and the associated evolution of
dust extinction. The model yields good fits of the UV and Lyman-alpha LFs at
z>~2. The weak evolution of both LFs between z=2 and z=6 is explained as the
combined effect of the negative evolution of the halo mass function, of the
increase with redshift of the star formation efficiency, and of dust
extinction. The slope of the faint end of the UV LF is found to steepen with
increasing redshift, implying that low luminosity galaxies increasingly
dominate the contribution to the UV background at higher and higher redshifts.
The observed range of UV luminosities at high-z implies a minimum halo mass
capable of hosting active star formation M_crit <~ 10^9.8 M_odot, consistent
with the constraints from hydrodynamical simulations. From fits of Lyman-alpha
LFs plus data on the luminosity dependence of extinction and from the measured
ratios of non-ionizing UV to Lyman-continuum flux density for samples of z=~3
Lyman break galaxies and Lyman-alpha emitters, we derive a simple relationship
between the escape fraction of ionizing photons and the star formation rate,
impling larger escape fraction for less massive galaxies. Galaxies already
represented in the UV LF (M_UV <~ -18) can keep the universe fully ionized up
to z=~6, consistent with (uncertain) data pointing to a rapid drop of the
ionization degree above z~6. On the other side, the electron scattering optical
depth, tau_es, inferred from CMB experiments favor an ionization degree close
to unity up to z=~9-10. Consistency with CMB data can be achieved if M_crit =~
10^8.5 M_odot, implying that the UV LFs extend to M_UV =~ -13, although the
corresponding tau_es is still on the low side of CMB-based estimates.

relationship between returns and volatility of a specific asset, focusing on
energy commodities futures, namely Brent and WTI crude oils, natural gas and
heating oil. After estimating the volatility process without assuming any
specific form of its behavior, we find the volatility to be long-term dependent
with the Hurst exponent on a verge of stationarity and non-stationarity.
Bypassing this using by using the detrended cross-correlation and the
detrending moving-average cross-correlation coefficients, we find the standard
leverage effect for both crude oil. For heating oil, the effect is not
statistically significant, and for natural gas, we find the inverse leverage
effect. Finally, we also show that none of the effects between returns and

can be further utilized to enhance forecasting models and mainly in the risk

  distributions",,,,,"stat.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Multivariate extreme value statistical analysis is concerned with
observations on several variables which are thought to possess some degree of
tail-dependence. In areas such as the modeling of financial and insurance
risks, or as the modeling of spatial variables, extreme value models in high
dimensions (up to fifty or more) with their statistical inference procedures
are needed. In this paper, we consider max-stable models for which the spectral
random vectors have absolutely continuous distributions. For random samples
with max-stable distributions we provide quasi-explicit analytical expressions
of the full likelihoods. When the full likelihood becomes numerically
intractable because of a too large dimension, it is however necessary to split
the components into subgroups and to consider a composite likelihood approach.
For random samples in the max-domain of attraction of a max-stable
distribution, two approaches that use simpler likelihoods are possible: (i) a
threshold approach that is combined with a censoring scheme, (ii) a block
maxima approach that exploits the information on the occurrence times of the
componentwise maxima. The asymptotic properties of the estimators are given and
the utility of the methods is examined via simulation. The estimators are also
compared with those derived from the pairwise composite likelihood method which
has been previously proposed in the spatial extreme value literature.

convenient (a priori) tool for estimating the adiabaticity of quantum
evolutions. However, the range of the applicability of QAC is not well
understood. It has been shown that QAC can become insufficient for guaranteeing
the validity of the adiabatic approximation, but under what conditions the QAC
would become necessary has become controversial. Furthermore, it is believed
that the inability for the QAC to reveal quantum adiabaticity is due to induced
resonant transitions. However, it is not clear how to quantify these
transitions in general. Here we present a progress to this problem by finding
an exact relation that can reveal how transition amplitudes are related to QAC
directly. As a posteriori condition for quantum adiabaticity, our result is
universally applicable to any (nondegenerate) quantum system and gives a clear
picture on how QAC could become insufficient or unnecessary for the adiabatic
approximation, which is a problem that has gained considerable interest in the
literature in recent years.

blueshift of $\sim$ 400 km s$^{-1}$ and an outflow-mass rate similar to the
accretion rate. Many other X-ray sources exhibit warm absorption features, and
they all show periodic dipping behavior at the same time. Recently, a dipping
periodicity has also been determined for GX 13+1 using long-term X-ray folded
light-curves, leading to a clear identification of one of such periodic dips in
an archival Chandra observation. We give the first spectral characterization of
the periodic dip of GX 13+1 found in this archival Chandra observation
performed in 2010. We used Chandra/HETGS data (1.0-10 keV band) and
contemporaneous RXTE/PCA data (3.5-25 keV) to analyze the broadband X-ray
spectrum. We adopted different spectral models to describe the continuum
emission and used the XSTAR-derived warm absorber component to constrain the
highly ionized absorption features. The 1.0-25 keV continuum emission is
consistent with a model of soft accretion-disk emission and an optically thick,
harder Comptonized component. The dip event, lasting $\sim$ 450 s, is
spectrally resolved with an increase in the column density of the neutral
absorber, while we do not find significant variations in the column density and
ionization parameter of the warm absorber with respect to the out-of-dip
spectrum. We argue that the very low dipping duty-cycle with respect to other
sources of the same class can be ascribed to its long orbital period and the
mostly neutral bulge, that is relatively small compared with the dimensions of
the outer disk radius.

initial time, are completely localised within the left or the right side of the
box. In this concrete set-up we directly face the problems inherent to a notion
of local field excitations, usually thought of as elementary particles.
Specifically, by computing the Bogoliubov coefficients relating local and
standard (global) quantizations, we show that the local quantisation yields a
Fock space $\mathfrak F^L$ which is unitarily inequivalent to the standard one
$\mathfrak F^G$. In spite of this, we find that the local creators and
annihilators remain well defined in the global Fock space $\mathfrak F^G$, and
so do the local number operators associated to the left and right partitions of
the box. We end up with a useful mathematical toolbox to analyse and
characterise local features of quantum states in $\mathfrak F^G$. Specifically,
an analysis of the global vacuum state $|0_G\rangle\in\mathfrak F^G$ in terms
of local number operators shows, as expected, the existence of entanglement
between the left and right regions of the box. The local vacuum
$|0_L\rangle\in\mathfrak F^L$, on the contrary, has a very different character.
It is neither cyclic nor separating and displays no entanglement. Further
analysis shows that the global vacuum also exhibits a distribution of local
excitations reminiscent, in some respects, of a thermal bath. We discuss how
the mathematical tools developed herein may open new ways for the analysis of
fundamental problems in local quantum field theory.

partial success, midinfrared light modulation has been recently achieved
through gating patterned graphene. Here we show that atomically thin noble

about half their width, thus leading to a factor-of-two change in light

that between 3 AU and 2 AU pre-perihelion a significant extended source started

due to icy grains, disappeared quickly around perihelion. Water production by
