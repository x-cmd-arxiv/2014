long-range Coulomb interactions for the electronic properties of graphene. We
investigate the spontaneous breaking of sublattice symmetry corresponding to a
transition from the semimetal to an antiferromagnetic insulating phase. Our
short-range interactions thereby include the partial screening due to electrons
in higher energy states from ab initio calculations based on the constrained
random phase approximation [T.O.Wehling {\it et al.}, Phys.Rev.Lett.{\bf 106},
236805 (2011)]. In contrast to a similar previous Monte-Carlo study
[M.V.Ulybyshev {\it et al.}, Phys.Rev.Lett.{\bf 111}, 056801 (2013)] we also
include a phenomenological model which describes the transition to the
unscreened bare Coulomb interactions of graphene at half filling in the
long-wavelength limit. Our results show, however, that the critical coupling
for the antiferromagnetic Mott transition is largely insensitive to the
strength of these long-range Coulomb tails. They hence confirm the prediction
that suspended graphene remains in the semimetal phase when a realistic static
screening of the Coulomb interactions is included.

benefitting all members of the community at the producer's cost. They could
seem to be in contradiction with natural selection, as non-cooperators have an
increased fitness compared to cooperators. Understanding the emergence of
cooperation has necessitated the development of concepts and models (inclusive
fitness, multilevel selection, ...) attributing deterministic advantages to
this behavior. In contrast to these models, we show here that cooperative
behaviors can emerge by taking into account the stochastic nature of
evolutionary dynamics : when cooperative behaviors increase the carrying
capacity of the habitat, they also increase the genetic drift against
non-cooperators. Using the Wright-Fisher models of population genetics, we
compute exactly this increased genetic drift and its consequences on the
fixation probability of both types of individuals. This computation leads to a
simple criterion: cooperative behavior dominates when the relative increase in
carrying capacity of the habitat caused by cooperators is higher than the
selection pressure against them. This is a purely stochastic effect with no
deterministic interpretation.

It is better to prevent security threats before they enter into the systems and
there is no way how this can be prevented without knowing where they come from.
The issue of resource allocation and revenue maximization is also equally
important especially when it comes to cloud security. This brings about the
necessity of different modelling techniques including but not limited; security
threat, resource allocation and revenue maximization models. This survey paper

properties and in probing the large grain population of the ISM. We discuss the
implications of the coreshine detected from the molecular cloud core L1506C in
the Taurus filament for the history of the core and the existence of a
primitive ISM component of large grains becoming visible in cores. The
coreshine surface brightness of L1506C is determined from IRAC Spitzer images
at 3.6 micron. We perform grain growth calculations to estimate the grain size
distribution in model cores similar in gas density, radius, and turbulent
velocity to L1506C. Scattered light intensities at 3.6 micron are calculated
for a variety of MRN and grain growth distributions to compare with the
observed coreshine. For a core with the overall physical properties of L1506C,
no detectable coreshine is predicted for an MRN size distribution. Extending
the distribution to grain radii of about 0.65 $\mu$m allows to reproduce the
observed surface brightness level in scattered light. Assuming the properties
of L1506C to be preserved, models for the growth of grains in cores do not
yield sufficient scattered light to account for the coreshine within the
lifetime of the Taurus complex. Only increasing the core density and the
turbulence amplifies the scattered light intensity to a level consistent with
the observed coreshine brightness. The grains could be part of primitive
omni-present large grain population becoming visible in the densest part of the
ISM, could grow under the turbulent dense conditions of former cores, or in
L1506C itself. In the later case, L1506C must have passed through a period of
larger density and stronger turbulence. This would be consistent with the
surprisingly strong depletion usually attributed to high column densities, and
with the large-scale outward motion of the core envelope observed today.

robustness. We compare it to a different symmetry known to control the dynamics

in the Sheet sit on opposite sides of the Council, raising the possibility that
they have somehow shepherded the evolution of the Local Group. The position
vector of the Andromeda galaxy with respect to the Milky Way deviates only 11
degrees from the Sheet plane and only 11 degrees from the projected axis of the
ellipticals. The Local Group appears to be moving away from a ridge in the
potential surface of the Council on a path parallel to the elliptical axis.
Spin directions of the giants in the Council are distributed over the sky in a
pattern which is very different from that of giants beyond, possibly in
reaction to the central mass asymmetry that developed into the Local Group. By
matching matter densities of Group and Council giants, the edge of the volume
of space most likely to have contributed to the development of the Local Group
is shown to be very close to where gravitational forces from the Local Group
and the Council balance. The boundary specification reveals that the Local
Sheet formed out of a density perturbation of very low amplitude (~10%), but
that normal matter was incorporated into galaxies with relatively high
efficiency (~40%). It appears that the development of the giants of the Local
Sheet was guided by a pre-existing flattened framework of matter.

in particular to the theory of realizability toposes.
  While the tools of categorical logic have proven very successful in analyzing
and organizing proof theoretic realizability interpretations, it was remarked
by experts (notably Peter Johnstone) that the field of realizability toposes
itself was not clearly delineated, and lacked a powerful theory analogous to
that of Grothendieck toposes.
  The present work sets out to remedy this situation to a certain extent. We
argue that realizability toposes are best understood using Grothendieck
fibrations, and develop a framework of fibrational cocompletions, which allows
to view certain constructions from realizability in precise analogy to
constructions of presheaf and sheaf toposes. Using these techniques, and a
class of posetal fibrations that we call uniform preorders, we are able to give
an extensional characterization of partial combinatory algebras and of the
realizability toposes that are constructed from these algebras.
  Striving to develop the analogy to Grothendieck toposes further, we outline
how to apply our techniques on arbitrary base toposes, and give a decomposition
theorem for constant objects functors induced by triposes, analogous to the
known decompositions of geometric morphisms. Finally, we sketch an approach of
how to find a unified framework for Grothendieck toposes and realizability
toposes, based on the observation that uniform preorders can be identified with
preorders internal to a category of sheaves.

angle of the observed GRB, we estimate a 1$\sigma$ RMS sensitivity of 68, 65
and 70 Jy for 5 second integrations at 37.9, 52.0, and 74.0 MHz at zenith.
These limits are relevant for pulses $\geq$ 5 s and are limited by dispersion
smearing. For pulses of length 5 s we are limited to dispersion measures
($DM$s) $\leq$ 220, 570, and 1,600 pc cm$^{-3}$ for the frequencies above. For
pulses lasting longer than 5s, the $DM$ limits increase linearly with the
duration of the pulse. We also report two interesting transients, which are, as
of yet, of unknown origin, and are not coincident with any known GRBs. For
general transients, we give rate density limits of $\leq$ $7.5\times10^{-3}$,
$2.9\times10^{-2}$, and $1.4\times10^{-2}$ yr$^{-1}$ deg$^{-2}$ with pulse
energy densities $>1.3\times 10^{-22}$, $1.1\times 10^{-22}$, and $1.4\times
10^{-22}$ J m$^{-2}$ Hz$^{-1}$ and pulse widths of 5 s at the frequencies given
above.

to take into account a back reaction effect due to the particle creation

factor in the matter dominated era of the form $t^{\frac{2}{3}+\varepsilon}$.
Based on recent $H(z)$ data, the best fit values for the mass of dark matter

from decelerated to accelerated expansion and admits a positive creation rate

creation rate was phenomenologically derived, here we have used a quantum

a self consistent justification for the physical process. This method also

production provides essential tests of that theory. But event-wise jet
reconstruction can be complex and susceptible to measurement bias. And QCD
theory in the form of Monte Carlo models of elementary collisions can also be
complex and difficult to test. It may be beneficial to construct a simple
static model of jet production in p-p collisions to facilitate data comparisons
and model tests. QCD is a logarithmic theory featuring variations with energy
scale of the form $\log(s/s_0)$. Jet-related data such as parton fragmentation
functions plotted on logarithmic rapidities exhibit self-similar scaling
behavior which admits simple and accurate parametrization with only a few
parameters. In this study we extend that method to construct a parametrization
of jet (scattered parton) momentum spectra based on certain measured
logarithmic jet production trends. The parametrization is established with
Sp\=pS jet data and then extrapolated for comparison with Tevatron and LHC jet
data. In addition, the jet production model from the present study is combined
with a parametrization of p-\=p fragmentation functions to predict the
minimum-bias jet fragment contribution to hadron $p_t$ spectra. The prediction
is compared with published p-p spectrum data to test the self-consistency of

in the COSMOS field using the spectroscopic sample of the VIMOS Ultra-Deep

AGNs or radio galaxies, so it is an ideal laboratory to study galaxy formation
in dense environments. The structure comprises 12 galaxies with secure
spectroscopic redshift in an area of 7'x8', in a z bin of Dz=0.016. The
measured galaxy number overdensity is delta_g=12+/-2. This overdensity has
total mass of M~8.1x10^(14)M_sun in a volume of 13x15x17 Mpc^3. Simulations
indicate that such an overdensity at z~2.9 is a proto-cluster that will
collapse in a cluster of total mass M~2.5x10^(15)M_sun at z=0. We compare the
properties of the galaxies within the overdensity with a control sample at the
same z but outside the overdensity. We did not find any statistically
significant difference between the properties (stellar mass, SFR, sSFR, NUV-r,
r-K) of the galaxies inside and outside the overdensity. The stacked spectrum
of galaxies in the overdensity background shows a significant absorption
feature at the wavelength of Lya redshifted at z=2.895 (lambda=4736 A), with a
rest frame EW = 4+/- 1.4 A. Stacking only background galaxies without
intervening sources at z~2.9 along their line of sight, we find that this
absorption feature has a rest frame EW of 10.8+/-3.7 A, with a detection S/N of
~4. These EW values imply a high column density (N(HI)~3-20x10^(19)cm^(-2)),
consistent with a scenario where such absorption is due to intervening cold gas
streams, falling into the halo potential wells of the proto-cluster galaxies.
However, we cannot exclude the hypothesis that this absorption is due to the
diffuse gas within the overdensity.

sample and explore, for the first time, the very low stellar mass end (M* <
10^8 M$_{\odot}$) of the luminosity-metallicity (LZR) and mass-metallicity
(MZR) relations at z < 1. Characterized by their extreme compactness (R50 < 1
kpc), low stellar mass and enhanced specific star formation rates (SFR/M* ~
10^{-9} - 10^{-7} yr^{-1}), the VUDS EELGs are blue dwarf galaxies likely
experiencing the first stages of a vigorous galaxy-wide starburst. Using
T_e-sensitive direct and strong-line methods, we find that VUDS EELGs are
low-metallicity (7.5 < 12+log(O/H) < 8.3) galaxies with high ionization
conditions, including at least three EELGs showing HeII 4686A emission and four
EELGs of extremely metal-poor (<10% solar) galaxies. The LZR and MZR followed
by EELGs show relatively large scatter, being broadly consistent with the
extrapolation toward low luminosity and mass from previous studies at similar
redshift. However, we find evidences that galaxies with younger and more
vigorous star formation -- as characterized by their larger EWs, ionization and
sSFR -- tend to be more metal-poor at a given stellar mass.

Lya emitters among UV selected star forming galaxies at 2<z<6, and to measure
the stellar escape fraction of Lya photons over the same redshift range.
Methods. We exploit the ultradeep spectroscopic observations collected by the
VIMOS Ultra Deep Survey (VUDS) to build an unique, complete and unbiased sample
of 4000 spectroscopically confirmed star forming galaxies at 2<z<6. Our galaxy
sample UV luminosities brighter than M* at 2<z<6, and luminosities down to one
magnitude fainter than M* at 2<z<3.5. Results. We find that 80% of the star
forming galaxies in our sample have EW0(Lya)<10A, and correspondingly
fesc(Lya)<1%. By comparing these results with literature, we conclude that the
bulk of the Lya luminosity at 2<z<6 comes from galaxies that are fainter in the
UV than those we sample in this work. The strong Lya emitters constitute, at
each redshift, the tail of the distribution of the galaxies with extreme
EW0(Lya) and fesc(Lya) . This tail of large EW0 and fesc(Lya) becomes more
important as the redshift increases, and causes the fraction of Lya with EW0>
25A to increase from 5% at z=2 to 30% at z=6, with the increase being
relatively stronger beyond z=4. We observe no difference, for the narrow range
of UV luminosities explored in this work, between the fraction of strong Lya
emitters among galaxies fainter or brighter than M*, although the fraction for
the FUV faint galaxies evolves faster, at 2<z<3.5, than for the bright ones. We
do observe an anticorrelation between E(B-V) and fesc(Lya): generally galaxies
with high fesc(Lya) have also small amounts of dust (and viceversa). However,
when the dust content is low (E(B-V)<0.05) we observe a very broad range of
fesc(Lya), ranging from 10^-3 to 1. This implies that the dust alone is not the
only regulator of the amount of escaping Lya photons.

increases in their host stars' luminosity to become hospitable for surface

climate response of a planet to a range of instellations from an F-, G-, or M-
dwarf star. The range of instellation that permits both complete ice cover and
at least partially ice-free climate states is a measure of the climate
hysteresis that a planet can exhibit. An ice-covered planet with high climate
hysteresis would show a higher resistance to the initial loss of surface ice
coverage with increases in instellation, and abrupt, extreme ice loss once
deglaciation begins. Our simulations indicate that the climate hysteresis
depends sensitively on the host star spectral energy distribution. Under fixed
CO2 conditions, a planet orbiting an M-dwarf star exhibits a smaller climate
hysteresis, requiring a smaller instellation to initiate deglaciation than
planets orbiting hotter, brighter stars. This is due to the higher absorption
of near-IR radiation by ice on the surfaces and greenhouse gases and clouds in
the atmosphere of an M-dwarf planet. Increases in atmospheric CO2 further lower
the climate hysteresis, as M-dwarf snowball planets exhibit a larger radiative
response than G-dwarf snowball planets for the same increase in CO2. For a
smaller hysteresis, planets near the outer edge of the habitable zone will thaw
earlier in their evolutionary history, and will experience a less abrupt
transition out of global ice cover.

information science, from quantum computers and simulators of complex quantum
systems to metrology and secure communication. All of these applications
require the quantum control of large networks of quantum bits (qubits) to
realize gains and speedups over conventional devices. However, propagating
quantum entanglement generally becomes difficult or impossible as the system
grows in size, owing to the inevitable decoherence from the complexity of
connections between the qubits and increased couplings to the environment.
Here, we demonstrate the first step in a modular approach to scaling
entanglement by utilizing a hierarchy of quantum buses on a collection of three
atomic ion qubits stored in two remote ion trap modules. Entanglement within a
module is achieved with deterministic near-field interactions through phonons,
and remote entanglement between modules is achieved through a probabilistic
interaction through photons. This minimal system allows us to address generic
issues in synchronization and scalability of entanglement with multiple buses,
while pointing the way toward a modular large-scale quantum computer
architecture that promises less spectral crowding and less decoherence. We
generate this modular entanglement faster than the observed qubit decoherence
rate, thus the system can be scaled to much larger dimensions by adding more
modules.

connection between the representation theory of the monster group $M$, the
largest of the simple sporadic groups, and certain modular functions, called
Hauptmodln. In particular, the $n$-th Fourier coefficient of Klein's
$j$-function is the dimension of the grade $n$ part of a special infinite
dimensional representation $V$ of the monster group. More generally the
coefficients of Hauptmoduln are graded traces $T_g$ of $g \in M$ acting on $V$.
Similar phenomena have been shown to hold for the Matthieu group $M_{24}$, but
instead of modular functions, mock modular forms must be used. This has been
conjecturally generalized even further, to umbral moonshine, which associates
to each of the 23 Niemeier lattices a finite group, infinite dimensional
representation, and mock modular form. We use generalized Borcherds products to
relate monstrous moonshine and umbral moonshine. Namely, we use mock modular
forms from umbral moonshine to construct via generalized Borcherds products
rational functions of the Hauptmoduln $T_g$ from monstrous moonshine. This
allows us to associate to each pure $A$-type Niemeier lattice a conjugacy class
$g$ of the monster group, and gives rise to identities relating dimensions of
representations from umbral moonshine to values of $T_g$. We also show that the
logarithmic derivatives of the Borcherds products are $p$-adic modular forms
for certain primes $p$ and describe some of the resulting properties of their
coefficients modulo $p$.

obtain a comprehensive mapping of the neural pathways that underlie human brain
function; an enhanced understanding of the wiring diagram of the brain promises
to lead to new breakthroughs in diagnosing and treating neurological disorders.
Inferring brain structure from image data, such as that obtained via electron
microscopy (EM), entails solving the problem of identifying biological
structures in large data volumes. Synapses, which are a key communication
structure in the brain, are particularly difficult to detect due to their small
size and limited contrast. Prior work in automated synapse detection has relied
upon time-intensive biological preparations (post-staining, isotropic slice
thicknesses) in order to simplify the problem.
  This paper presents VESICLE, the first known approach designed for mammalian
synapse detection in anisotropic, non-post-stained data. Our methods explicitly
leverage biological context, and the results exceed existing synapse detection
methods in terms of accuracy and scalability. We provide two different
approaches - one a deep learning classifier (VESICLE-CNN) and one a lightweight
Random Forest approach (VESICLE-RF) to offer alternatives in the
performance-scalability space. Addressing this synapse detection challenge
enables the analysis of high-throughput imaging data soon expected to reach
petabytes of data, and provide tools for more rapid estimation of brain-graphs.
Finally, to facilitate community efforts, we developed tools for large-scale
object detection, and demonstrated this framework to find $\approx$ 50,000
synapses in 60,000 $\mu m ^3$ (220 GB on disk) of electron microscopy data.

the sky, to measure spatial variations in the total extragalactic light
emission and use these as a tracer of the clustering of matter. A main
challenge is that the observed intensity as a function of wavelength is a
convolution of the source luminosity density with the rest-frame spectral

deconvolution as a way to invert this convolution and extract the clustering
information. We show how one can use observations of the mean and angular
fluctuations of extragalactic light as a function of wavelength, assuming
statistical isotropy, to reconstruct jointly the rest-frame spectral energy
distribution of the sources and the source spatial density fluctuations. This

neutron star (NS) is often assumed a unique prediction of general relativity.
However, it has been argued that ISCO also appears around highly elliptic
bodies described by Newtonian theory. In this sense, the behaviour of an ISCO
around a rotating oblate neutron star is formed by the interplay between
relativistic and Newtonian effects. Here we briefly explore the consequences of
this interplay using a straightforward analytic approach as well as numerical
models that involve modern NS equations of state. We examine the ratio K
between the ISCO radius and the radius of the neutron star. We find that, with
growing NS spin, the ratio K first decreases, but then starts to increase. This
non-monotonic behaviour of K can give rise to a neutron star spin interval in
which ISCO appears for two very different ranges of NS mass. This may strongly
affect the distribution of neutron stars that have an ISCO (ISCO-NS). When
(all) neutron stars are distributed around a high mass M0, the ISCO-NS spin
distribution is roughly the same as the spin distribution corresponding to all
neutron stars. In contrast, if M0 is low, the ISCO-NS distribution can only
have a peak around a high value of spin. Finally, an intermediate value of M0
can imply an ISCO-NS distribution divided into two distinct groups of slow and
fast rotators. Our findings have immediate astrophysical applications. They can
be used for example to distinguish between different models of high-frequency
quasiperiodic oscillations observed in low-mass NS X-ray binaries.

protoplanetary discs are still unknown, although they could have important
consequences for the dynamics and evolution of the disc. Using a mean-field
approach in which we model the effects of turbulence through enhanced diffusion
coefficients, we study the time-evolution of the large-scale poloidal magnetic
field in a global model of a thin accretion disc, with particular attention to
protoplanetary discs. With the transport coefficients usually assumed, the
magnetic field strength does not significantly increase radially inwards,
leading to a relatively weak magnetic field in the inner part of the disc. We
show that with more realistic transport coefficients that take into account the
vertical structure of the disc and the back-reaction of the magnetic field on
the flow as obtained by Guilet & Ogilvie (2012), the magnetic field can
significantly increase radially inwards. The magnetic-field profile adjusts to
reach an equilibrium value of the plasma $\beta$ parameter (the ratio of
midplane thermal pressure to magnetic pressure) in the inner part of the disc.
This value of $\beta$ depends strongly on the aspect ratio of the disc and on
the turbulent magnetic Prandtl number, and lies in the range $10^4-10^7$ for
protoplanetary discs. Such a magnetic field is expected to affect significantly
the dynamics of protoplanetary discs by increasing the strength of MHD
turbulence and launching an outflow. We discuss the implications of our results
for the evolution of protoplanetary discs and for the formation of powerful

multiple disciplines including graph theory, computer science, statistical

the study of the general structure of differentiable graphon parameters $F$. We
derive consistency conditions among the higher G\^ateaux derivatives of $F$
when restricted to the subspace of edge weighted graphs $\mathcal{W}_{\bf p}$.
Surprisingly, these constraints are rigid enough to imply that the multilinear
functionals $\Lambda: \mathcal{W}_{\bf p}^n \to \mathbb{R}$ satisfying the
constraints are determined by a finite set of constants indexed by isomorphism
classes of multigraphs with $n$ edges and no isolated vertices. Using this
structure theory, we explain the central role that homomorphism densities play
in the analysis of graphons, by way of a new combinatorial interpretation of
their derivatives. In particular, homomorphism densities serve as the monomials
in a polynomial algebra that can be used to approximate differential graphon
parameters as Taylor polynomials. These ideas are summarized by our main
theorem, which asserts that homomorphism densities $t(H,-)$ where $H$ has at
most $N$ edges form a basis for the space of smooth graphon parameters whose
$(N+1)$st derivatives vanish. As a consequence of this theory, we also extend
and derive new proofs of linear independence of multigraph homomorphism
densities, and characterize homomorphism densities. In addition, we develop a
theory of series expansions, including Taylor's theorem for graph parameters
and a uniqueness principle for series. We use this theory to analyze questions
raised by Lov\'asz, including studying infinite quantum algebras and the
connection between right- and left-homomorphism densities.

optimal capacity scaling at high SNR in interference networks. However, most
existing IA designs require full channel state information (CSI) at the
transmitters, which would lead to significant CSI signaling overhead. There are
two techniques, namely CSI quantization and CSI feedback filtering, to reduce
the CSI feedback overhead. In this paper, we consider IA processing with CSI
feedback filtering in MIMO cellular networks. We introduce a novel metric,
namely the feedback dimension, to quantify the first order CSI feedback cost
associated with the CSI feedback filtering. The CSI feedback filtering poses
several important challenges in IA processing. First, there is a hidden partial
CSI knowledge constraint in IA precoder design which cannot be handled using
conventional IA design methodology. Furthermore, existing results on the
feasibility conditions of IA cannot be applied due to the partial CSI
knowledge. Finally, it is very challenging to find out how much CSI feedback is
actually needed to support IA processing. We shall address the above challenges
and propose a new IA feasibility condition under partial CSIT knowledge in MIMO
cellular networks. Based on this, we consider the CSI feedback profile design
subject to the degrees of freedom requirements, and we derive closed-form
trade-off results between the CSI feedback cost and IA performance in MIMO
cellular networks.

sign problem and is constructed to best reproduce broad features of the chiral
nuclear force. This is facilitated by choosing a lattice spacing of 1.5 fm,
corresponding to a momentum-space cutoff of Lambda = 414 MeV/c, a resolution
scale at which strongly repulsive features of nuclear two-body forces are
suppressed. Differences between the evolution potential and the full chiral
nuclear interaction (Entem and Machleidt Lambda = 414 MeV) are then treated
perturbatively. Our results for the equation of state are compared to previous
quantum Monte Carlo simulations which employed chiral two-body forces at
next-to-next-to-leading order (N2LO). In addition we include the effects of
three-body forces at N2LO, which provide important repulsion at densities
higher than 0.02 fm^-3, as well as two-body forces at N3LO.

important device applications such as lasers, light-emitting diodes, solar
cells and high-electron-mobility transistors. Analogous to traditional
heterostructures, layered transition metal dichalcogenide (TMDC)
heterostructures can be designed and built by assembling individual
single-layers into functional multilayer structures, but in principle with
atomically sharp interfaces, no interdiffusion of atoms, digitally controlled
layered components and no lattice parameter constraints. Nonetheless, the
optoelectronic behavior of this new type of van der Waals (vdW) semiconductor
heterostructure is unknown at the single-layer limit. Specifically, it is
experimentally unknown whether the optical transitions will be spatially direct
or indirect in such hetero-bilayers. Here, we investigate artificial
semiconductor heterostructures built from single layer WSe2 and MoS2 building
blocks. We observe a large Stokes-like shift of ~100 meV between the
photoluminescence peak and the lowest absorption peak that is consistent with a
type II band alignment with spatially direct absorption but spatially indirect
emission. Notably, the photoluminescence intensity of this spatially indirect
transition is strong, suggesting strong interlayer coupling of charge carriers.
The coupling at the hetero-interface can be readily tuned by inserting
hexagonal BN (h-BN) dielectric layers into the vdW gap. The generic nature of
this interlayer coupling consequently provides a new degree of freedom in band
engineering and is expected to yield a new family of semiconductor
heterostructures having tunable optoelectronic properties with customized
composite layers.

strain effect on the electronic band structure of phosphorene was studied using
first principles methods. It was found that phosphorene can withstand a surface
tension and tensile strain up to 10 N/m and 30%, respectively. The band gap of
phosphorene experiences a direct-indirect-direct transition when axial strain
is applied. A moderate -2% compression in the zigzag direction can trigger this
gap transition. With sufficient expansion (+11.3%) or compression (-10.2%
strains), the gap can be tuned from indirect to direct again. Five strain zones
with distinct electronic band structure were identified and the critical
strains for the zone boundaries were determined. The origin of the gap
transition was revealed and a general mechanism was developed to explain energy
shifts with strain according to the bond nature of near-band-edge electronic
orbitals. Effective masses of carriers in the armchair direction are an order
of magnitude smaller than that of the zigzag axis indicating the armchair
direction is favored for carrier transport. In addition, the effective masses
can be dramatically tuned by strain, in which its sharp jump/drop occurs at the
zone boundaries of the direct-indirect gap transition.

being to account for the dynamics of logical proofs. In Ludics, objects called
designs keep only what is relevant for the cut elimination process, hence the
dynamics of a proof: a design is an abstraction of a formal proof. The notion
of behaviour is the counterpart in Ludics of the notion of type or the logical
notion of formula. Formally a behaviour is a closed set of designs. Our aim is
to explore the constructions of behaviours and to analyse their properties. In
this paper a design is viewed as a set of coherent paths. We recall or give
variants of properties concerning visitable paths, where a visitable path is a
path in a design or a set of designs that may be traversed by interaction with
a design of the orthogonal of the set. We are then able to answer the following
question: which properties should satisfy a set of paths for being exactly the
set of visitable paths of a behaviour? Such a set and its dual should be
prefix-closed, daimon-closed and satisfy two saturation properties. This allows
us to have a means for defining the whole set of visitable paths of a given set
of designs without closing it explicitly, that is without computing the
orthogonal of this set of designs. We finally apply all these results for
making explicit the structure of a behaviour generated by constants and
multiplicative/additive connectives. We end by proposing an oriented tensor for
which we give basic properties.

necessary enzyme and membrane components from nutrients, the entropy production
per unit cell-volume growth is calculated analytically and numerically based on
the rate equation for chemical kinetics and linear non-equilibrium
thermodynamics. The minimal entropy production per unit cell growth is found to
be achieved at a non-zero nutrient uptake rate, rather than at a quasi-static
limit as in the standard Carnot engine. This difference appears because the
equilibration mediated by the enzyme exists only within cells that grow through
enzyme and membrane synthesis. Optimal nutrient uptake is also confirmed by
protocell models with many chemical components synthesized through a catalytic

optimal yield for cellular growth is also discussed.

rich molecular gas environment and an unusually high ratio of infrared to radio
luminosity (q-factor). The compact nucleus is powered by either a compact
starburst or an active galactic nucleus (AGN). The aim of this study is to
constrain the nature of the nuclear region (starburst or AGN) within NGC 4418
via very-high-resolution radio imaging. Archival data from radio observations
using the EVN and MERLIN interferometers are imaged. Sizes and flux densities
are obtained by fitting Gaussian intensity distributions to the image. The
average spectral index of the compact radio emission is estimated from
measurements at 1.4 GHz and 5.0 GHz. The nuclear structure of NGC 4418 visible
with EVN and MERLIN consists of eight compact (<49 mas i.e. <8 pc) features
spread within a region of 250 mas, i.e. 41 pc. We derive an inverted spectral
index $\alpha\ge0.7$ ($S_\nu\propto\nu^{\alpha}$) for the compact radio
emission. Brightness temperatures $>10^{4.8}$ K indicate that these compact
features cannot be HII-regions. The complex morphology and inverted spectrum of
the eight detected compact features is evidence against the hypothesis that an
AGN alone is powering the nucleus of NGC 4418. The compact features could be
super star clusters (SSCs) with intense star formation, and their associated
free-free absorption could then naturally explain both their inverted radio
spectrum and the low radio to IR ratio of the nucleus. The required star
formation area density is extreme, however, and close to the limit of what can
be observed in a well-mixed thermal/non-thermal plasma produced by
star-formation, and is also close to the limit of what can be physically

zero-forcing detection (ZF) is appealing because of its low complexity. Our
recent MIMO ZF performance analysis for Rician--Rayleigh fading, which is
relevant in heterogeneous networks, has yielded for the ZF outage probability
and ergodic capacity infinite-series expressions. Because they arose from
expanding the confluent hypergeometric function $ {_1\! F_1} (\cdot, \cdot,
\sigma) $ around 0, they do not converge numerically at realistically-high
Rician $ K $-factor values. Therefore, herein, we seek to take advantage of the
fact that $ {_1\! F_1} (\cdot, \cdot, \sigma) $ satisfies a differential
equation, i.e., it is a \textit{holonomic} function. Holonomic functions can be
computed by the \textit{holonomic gradient method} (HGM), i.e., by numerically
solving the satisfied differential equation. Thus, we first reveal that the
moment generating function (m.g.f.) and probability density function (p.d.f.)
of the ZF signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) are holonomic. Then, from the
differential equation for $ {_1\! F_1} (\cdot, \cdot, \sigma) $, we deduce
those satisfied by the SNR m.g.f. and p.d.f., and demonstrate that the HGM
helps compute the p.d.f. accurately at practically-relevant values of $ K $.
Finally, numerical integration of the SNR p.d.f. produced by HGM yields
accurate ZF outage probability and ergodic capacity results.

the Jacobian at the steady state has no eigenvalues with zero real parts. In
this case, the linearized system does qualitatively capture the dynamics in a
small neighborhood of the hyperbolic steady state. However, one is often forced
to consider non-hyperbolic steady states, for example in the context of
bifurcation theory. A geometric technique to desingularize non-hyperbolic
points is the blow-up method. The classical case of the method is motivated by
desingularization techniques arising in algebraic geometry. The idea is to blow
up the steady state to a sphere or a cylinder. In the blown-up space, one is
then often able to gain additional hyperbolicity at steady states. In this
paper, we discuss an explicit example where we replace the sphere in the
blow-up by hyperbolic space. It is shown that the calculations work in the
hyperbolic space case as for the spherical case. This approach may be even
slightly more convenient if one wants to work with directional charts. Hence,
it is demonstrated that the sphere should be viewed as an auxiliary object in
the blow-up construction. Other smooth manifolds are also natural candidates to
be inserted at steady states.

Biol. {\bf 317} (2013) 286) have shown the existence, on a square lattice, of
two distinct phases, with either four or three coexisting species. In both
phases, each agent is eventually replaced by one of its predators but these
strategy oscillations remain localized as long as the interactions are short
ranged. Distant regions may be either out of phase or cycling through different
food web subloops (if any). Here we show that upon replacing a minimum fraction
$Q_c$ of the short range interactions by long range ones, there is a Hopf
bifurcation and global oscillations become stable. Surprisingly, to build such
long distance, global synchronization, the four species coexistence phase
requires less long range interactions than the three species phase, while one
would naively expect the contrary. Moreover, deviations from highly homogeneous
conditions ($\chi=0$ or 1) increase $Q_c$ and the more heterogeneous is the
food web, the harder the synchronization is. By further increasing $Q$, while
the three species phase remains stable, the four species one has a transition
to an absorbing, single species state. The existence of a phase with global
oscillations for ${\cal S}>3$, when the interaction graph has multiple subloops
and several possible local cycles, lead to the conjecture that global
oscillations are a general characteristic, even for large, realistic food webs.

employ several different community-identification procedures (using
diffusion-based and geodesic-based dynamics) to investigate community quality
as a function of community size. Using several empirical and synthetic
networks, we identify several distinct scenarios for ``size-resolved community
structure'' that can arise in real (and realistic) networks. Depending on which
scenario holds, one may or may not be able to successfully identify ``good''
communities in a given network, the manner in which different small communities
fit together to form meso-scale network structures can be very different, and
processes such as viral propagation and information diffusion can exhibit very
different dynamics.In addition, our results suggest that, for many large
realistic networks, the output of locally-biased methods that focus on
communities that are centered around a given seed node might have better
conceptual grounding and greater practical utility than the output of global
community-detection methods. They also illustrate subtler structural properties
that are important to consider in the development of better benchmark networks
to test methods for community detection.

appropriate metrics that can be defined on them, in other words to study
""Infinite groups as geometric objects"", as Gromov writes it in the title of a
famous article. The theme has often been restricted to finitely generated
groups, but it can favorably be played for locally compact groups. The
development of the theory is illustrated by numerous examples, including matrix
groups with entries in the the field of real or complex numbers, or other
locally compact fields such as p-adic fields, isometry groups of various metric
spaces, and, last but not least, discrete group themselves. Word metrics for
compactly generated groups play a major role. In the particular case of
finitely generated groups, they were introduced by Dehn around 1910 in
connection with the Word Problem. Some of the results exposed concern general
locally compact groups, such as criteria for the existence of compatible
metrics on locally compact groups. Other results concern special classes of
groups, for example those mapping onto the group of integers (the Bieri-Strebel
splitting theorem for locally compact groups).
  Prior to their applications to groups, the basic notions of coarse and
large-scale geometry are developed in the general framework of metric spaces.
Coarse geometry is that part of geometry concerning properties of metric spaces
that can be formulated in terms of large distances only. In particular coarse
connectedness, coarse simple connectedness, metric coarse equivalences, and
quasi-isometries of metric spaces are given special attention. The final
chapters are devoted to the more restricted class of compactly presented
groups, generalizing finitely presented groups to the locally compact setting.
They can indeed be characterized as those compactly generated locally compact
groups that are coarsely simply connected.

agglomeration of the first massive stars in the universe. However, when the
masses of the stars approach $10^{6}$ M$_{\odot}$, the stars become unstable
and collapse, possibly forming the first generation of cosmological black
holes. Here we speculate that the claimed detection of an isotropic radio
background may constitute evidence of the formation of these first supermassive
black holes, since their data are compatible in spectrum and intensity with
synchrotron emission from the remnants. The model proposed fulfills all
observational conditions for the background, in terms of single-source
strength, number of sources, far-infrared and gamma-ray emission. The observed
high energy neutrino flux is consistent with our calculations in flux and

formation and growth of massive bulge-less disk galaxies as derived from the
massive, gaseous shell formed during the explosion prior to the formation of a
supermassive black hole.

for the multiplicity of the minimum eigenvalue of the ""optimal information

the corresponding optimality criterion is not differentiable at the optimal

The extremal polynomials which solve these Chebyshev problems are constructed
explicitly leading to a complete solution of the corresponding $E$-optimal

the delay, the intensity modulation in the signal resulting from the
differential detection of the Stokes and anti-Stokes radiations generated at
the sample. The Fourier transform of such time-domain signal reveals the

matter waves with the cubic self-attraction cannot produce stable solitons in
free space because of the occurrence of the collapse in the same setting. By
means of the numerical analysis and variational approximation, we demonstrate
that the two-component model of the Bose-Einstein condensate, with the
spin-orbit Rashba coupling and cubic attractive interactions, gives rise to
solitary-vortex complexes of two types: semi-vortices (SVs, with a vortex in
one component and a fundamental soliton in the other), and mixed modes (MMs,
with topological charges 0 and +1/-1 mixed in both components). These two-
dimensional composite modes can be created using the trapping
harmonic-oscillator (HO) potential, but remain stable in the free space, if the
trap is gradually removed. The SVs and MMs realize the ground state of the
system, provided that the self-attraction in the two components is,
respectively, stronger or weaker than the cross-attraction between them. The
SVs and MMs which are not the ground state are subject to a drift instability.
In the free space (in the absence of the HO trap), modes of both types
degenerate into unstable Townes solitons when their norms attain the respective
critical values, while there is no lower existence threshold for the stable
modes. Moving free-space stable solitons are also found in the present
non-Galilean-invariant system, up to a critical velocity. Collisions between
two moving solitons lead to their merger into a single one.

  Rhythmic Exercises",,,,,"q-bio.QM cs.SY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Physical exercise has significant benefits for humans in improving the health
and quality of their lives, by improving the functional performance of their
cardiovascular and respiratory systems. However, it is very important to
control the workload, e.g. the frequency of body movements, within the
capability of the individual to maximise the efficiency of the exercise. The
workload is generally represented in terms of heart rate (HR) and oxygen
consumption VO2. We focus particularly on the control of HR and VO2 using the
workload of an individual body movement, also known as the exercise rate (ER),
in this research. The first part of this report deals with the modelling and
control of HR during an unknown type of rhythmic exercise. A novel feature of
the developed system is to control HR via manipulating ER as a control input.
The relation between ER and HR is modelled using a simple autoregressive model
with unknown parameters. The parameters of the model are estimated using a
Kalman filter and an indirect adaptive H1 controller is designed. The
performance of the system is tested and validated on six subjects during rowing
and cycling exercise. The results demonstrate that the designed control system
can regulate HR to a predefined profile. The second part of this report deals
with the problem of estimating VO2 during rhythmic exercise, as the direct
measurement of VO2 is not realisable in these environments. Therefore,
non-invasive sensors are used to measure HR, RespR, and ER to estimate VO2. The
developed approach for cycling and rowing exercise predicts the percentage
change in maximum VO2 from the resting to the exercising phases, using a
Hammerstein model.. Results show that the average quality of fit in both
exercises is improved as the intensity of exercise is increased.

radio access scheme for next generation wireless communication systems because
of its inherent immunity to multipath interference due to a low symbol rate,
the use of a cyclic prefix, and its affinity to different transmission
bandwidth arrangements. OFDM has already been adopted as a radio access scheme
for several of the latest cellular system specifications such as the long-term
evolution (LTE) system in the 3GPP (3rd Generation Partnership Project).
Nevertheless, peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) of OFDM signal is a
significant drawback since it restricts the efficiency of the transmitter. A
number of promising approaches have been proposed & implemented to reduce PAPR
