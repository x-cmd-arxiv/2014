links, that share a common channel, and address the problem of emptying finite
traffic volume from the transmitters in minimum time. This, so called,
minimum-time scheduling problem has been proved to be NP-hard in general. In
this paper, we study a class of minimum-time scheduling problems in which the
link rates have a particular structure consistent with the assumed environment
and topology. We show that global optimality can be reached in polynomial time
and derive optimality conditions. Then we consider a more general case in which
we apply the same approach and thus obtain approximation as well as lower and
upper bounds to the optimal solution. Simulation results confirm and validate
our approach.

experiment by having absence of higher-order interference as a postulate, which
is currently the subject of experimental investigation. We give three
postulates -- no higher-order interference, classical decomposability of
states, and strong symmetry -- and prove that the only non-classical
operational probabilistic theories satisfying them are real, complex, and
quaternionic quantum theory, together with 3-level octonionic quantum theory
and ball state spaces of arbitrary dimension. Then we show that adding
observability of energy as a fourth postulate yields complex quantum theory as
the unique solution, relating the emergence of the complex numbers to the
possibility of Hamiltonian dynamics. We also show that there may be interesting
non-quantum theories satisfying only the first two of our postulates, which
would allow for higher-order interference in experiments while still respecting
the contextuality analogue of the local orthogonality principle.

quantizing the input of each node. The performance of the proposed method for
different information rate constraints, in a binary hypothesis test, is
compared to the optimum rate-one solution due to Swaszek and a method proposed

predicted in standard BBN model and those inferred from observations of
metal-poor stars. In this model 7Be is destroyed via the recombination with an
X- particle followed by radiative proton capture. We calculate precise rates
for the radiative recombinations of 7Be, 7Li, 9Be, and 4He with X-. In
nonresonant rates we take into account respective partial waves of scattering
states and respective bound states. The finite sizes of nuclear charge
distributions cause deviations in wave functions from those of point-charge
nuclei. For a heavy X- mass, m_X \gtrsim 100 GeV, the d-wave --> 2P transition
is most important for 7Li and 7,9Be, unlike recombination with electrons. Our
new nonresonant rate of the 7Be recombination for m_X=1000 GeV is more than 6
times larger than the existing rate. Moreover, we suggest a new important
reaction for 9Be production: the recombination of 7Li and X- followed by
deuteron capture. We derive binding energies of X-nuclei along with reaction
rates and Q-values. We then calculate BBN and find that the amount of 7Be
destruction depends significantly on the charge distribution of 7Be. Finally,
updated constraints on the initial abundance and the lifetime of the X- are
derived in the context of revised upper limits to the primordial 6Li abundance.
Parameter regions for the solution to the 7Li problem are revised, and the
primordial 9Be abundances is revised.

dielectric media has been widely studied during the last few decades. However,
several aspects of energy transfer and its relation to consistently defining
position-dependent ladder operators for the electromagnetic field in
nonequilibrium conditions have partly escaped the attention. In this work we
define the position-dependent ladder operators and an effective local
photon-number operator that are consistent with the canonical commutation
relations and use these concepts to describe the energy transfer and thermal
balance in layered geometries. This approach results in a position-dependent
photon-number concept that is simple and consistent with classical energy
conservation arguments. The operators are formed by first calculating the
vector potential operator using Green's function formalism and Langevin noise
source operators related to the medium and its temperature, and then defining
the corresponding position-dependent annihilation operator that is required to
satisfy the canonical commutation relations in arbitrary geometry. Our results
suggest that the effective photon number associated with the electric field is
generally position dependent and enables a straightforward method to calculate
the energy transfer rate between the field and the local medium. In particular,
our results predict that the effective photon number in a vacuum cavity formed
between two lossy material layers can oscillate as a function of the position
suggesting that also the local field temperature oscillates. These oscillations

experimental setups in which the field-matter interaction is dominated by the

operator in VI consists of the gradient of a smooth function, the rate of
convergence of the AMP method can be accelerated in terms of its dependence on
the Lipschitz constant of the smooth function. For VIs with bounded feasible
sets, the estimate of the rate of convergence of the AMP method depends on the
diameter of the feasible set. For unbounded VIs, we adopt the modified gap
function introduced by Monteiro and Svaiter for solving monotone inclusion, and
demonstrate that the rate of convergence of the AMP method depends on the
distance from the initial point to the set of strong solutions.

either on $R^n$ or a Riemannian manifold, under the assumption of Lipschitz
control on the coefficients $a^{ij}$. We focus our attention on the critical
set $Cr(u)\equiv\{x:|\nabla u|=0\}$ and the singular set
$S(u)\equiv\{x:u=|\nabla u|=0\}$, and more importantly on effective versions of
these. Currently, under the coefficient control we have assumed, the strongest
results in the literature say that the singular set is n-2-dimensional, however
at this point it has not even been shown that $H^{n-2}(S)<\infty$ unless the
coefficients are smooth. Fundamentally, this is due to the need of an
$\epsilon$-regularity theorem which requires higher coefficient control as the
frequency increases. We introduce new techniques for estimating the critical
and singular set, which avoids the need of any such $\epsilon$-regularity.
Consequently, we prove that if the frequency of u is bounded by $\Lambda$ then
we have the estimates $H^{n-2}(C(u))\leq C^{\Lambda^2}$, $H^{n-2}(S(u))\leq
C^{\Lambda^2}$, depending on whether the equation is critical or not. More
importantly, we prove corresponding estimates for the {\it effective} critical
and singular sets. Even under the assumption of analytic coefficients these
results are much sharper than those currently in the literature. We also give
applications of the technique to the nodal set of solutions, and to give
estimates on the corresponding eigenvalue problem.

to operate in different environments that require diverse behavioral skills.
Despite these geometric and behavioral diversities, the examination of cerebral
cortex across species reveals that it contains a substantial number of
conserved characteristics that are associated with neuroanatomy and metabolism,
i.e. with neuronal connectivity and function. Some of these cortical constants
or invariants have been known for a long time but not sufficiently appreciated,
and others were only recently discovered. The focus of this review is to
present the cortical invariants and discuss their role in the efficient
information processing. Global conservation in neuroanatomy and metabolism, as
well as their correlated regional and developmental variability suggest that
these two parallel systems are mutually coupled. It is argued that energetic
constraint on cortical organization can be strong if cerebral blood supplied is
either below or above a certain level, and it is rather soft otherwise.
Moreover, because maximization or minimization of parameters associated with
cortical connectivity, function and cost often leads to conflicts in design, it
is argued that the architecture of the cerebral cortex is a result of
structural and functional compromises.

sequential decision making problems. Given any MDP the aim is to find the
optimal action selection mechanism i.e., the optimal policy. Typically, the
optimal policy ($u^*$) is obtained by substituting the optimal value-function
($J^*$) in the Bellman equation. Alternately $u^*$ is also obtained by learning
the optimal state-action value function $Q^*$ known as the $Q$ value-function.
However, it is difficult to compute the exact values of $J^*$ or $Q^*$ for MDPs
with large number of states. Approximate Dynamic Programming (ADP) methods
address this difficulty by computing lower dimensional approximations of
$J^*$/$Q^*$. Most ADP methods employ linear function approximation (LFA), i.e.,
the approximate solution lies in a subspace spanned by a family of pre-selected
basis functions. The approximation is obtain via a linear least squares
projection of higher dimensional quantities and the $L_2$ norm plays an
important role in convergence and error analysis. In this paper, we discuss ADP
methods for MDPs based on LFAs in $(\min,+)$ algebra. Here the approximate
solution is a $(\min,+)$ linear combination of a set of basis functions whose
span constitutes a subsemimodule. Approximation is obtained via a projection
operator onto the subsemimodule which is different from linear least squares
projection used in ADP methods based on conventional LFAs. MDPs are not
$(\min,+)$ linear systems, nevertheless, we show that the monotonicity property
of the projection operator helps us to establish the convergence of our ADP
schemes. We also discuss future directions in ADP methods for MDPs based on the

Relatively small gaps and low transition temperatures of conventional s-wave
superconductors put the hard constraints on these experiments. Significantly
larger gaps and higher transition temperatures in cuprate superconductors might
be an attractive alternative to considerably relax these constraints, but it is
not clear whether the proximity effect would be effective in heterostructures
involving cuprates and topological insulators. Here, we present angle-resolved
photoemission studies of thin Bi2Se3 films grown in-situ on optimally doped

suggest that the superconducting proximity effect between a cuprate
superconductor and a topological insulator is strongly suppressed, likely due
to a very short coherence length along the c-axis, incompatible crystal and
pairing symmetries at the interface, small size of the topological surface

renormalization group technique and compare it with a mean-field approach. The
presence of the ferromagnetic Ising-like transition modifies the Mott lobes. In
the Mott insulating region the system maps to the ferromagnetic spin-1/2 XXZ

larger fraction corresponds to the u-quark that carries proton helicity, and
determine the value of the wave function at the origin in position space, which

rules. Higher-order moments are constrained by our data and are all compatible
with zero within our uncertainties. We also calculate the normalization
constants of the higher-twist DAs that are related to the distribution of quark
angular momentum. Furthermore, we use the variational method and customized
parity projection operators to study the states with negative parity. In this
way we are able to separate the contributions of the two lowest states that, as
we argue, possibly correspond to N*(1535) and a mixture of N*(1650) and the
pion-nucleon continuum, respectively. It turns out that the state that we
identify with N*(1535) has a very different DA as compared to both the second

forth by Strohmer and Vershynin iteratively projects onto a randomly chosen

exponentially in expectation to the solution of a consistent system. In this
paper we analyze two block versions of the method each with a randomized

inconsistent systems. Our approach utilizes a paving of the matrix A to
guarantee exponential convergence, and suggests that paving yields a
significant improvement in performance in certain regimes. The proposed method
is an extension of the block Kaczmarz method analyzed by Needell and Tropp and
the Randomized Extended Kaczmarz method of Zouzias and Freris. The contribution
is thus two-fold; unlike the standard Kaczmarz method, our methods converge to
the least-squares solution of inconsistent systems, and by using appropriate

spin-orbit coupling near the metal-insulator interfaces, even if spin-orbit
coupling is negligible in the bulk of the film. In this paper we study two
technologically important and deeply interconnected effects that arise from
interfacial spin-orbit coupling in metallic films. The first is the spin Hall
effect, whereby a charge current in the plane of the film is partially
converted into an orthogonal spin current in the same plane. The second is the
Edelstein effect, in which a charge current produces an in-plane, transverse
spin polarization. At variance with strictly two-dimensional Rashba systems, we
find that the spin Hall conductivity has a finite value even if spin-orbit
interaction with impurities is neglected and ""vertex corrections"" are properly
taken into account. Even more remarkably, such finite value becomes ""universal""
in a certain configuration. This is a direct consequence of the spatial
dependence of spin-orbit coupling on the third dimension, perpendicular to the
film plane. The non-vanishing spin Hall conductivity has a profound influence
on the Edelstein effect, which we show to consist of two terms, the first with
the standard form valid in a strictly two-dimensional Rashba system, and a
second arising from the presence of the third dimension. Whereas the standard
term is proportional to the momentum relaxation time, the new one scales with
the spin relaxation time. Our results, although derived in a specific model,
should be valid rather generally, whenever a spatially dependent Rashba
spin-orbit coupling is present and the electron motion is not strictly
two-dimensional.

degree of reservoir reduction needed for cure remains unknown. Here we use a
stochastic model of infection dynamics to estimate the efficacy of LRA needed
to prevent viral rebound after ART interruption. We incorporate clinical data
to estimate population-level parameter distributions and outcomes. Our findings
suggest that approximately 2,000-fold reductions are required to permit a

rebound may occur suddenly after multiple years. Greater than 10,000-fold
reductions may be required to prevent rebound altogether. Our results predict
large variation in rebound times following LRA therapy, which will complicate
clinical management. This model provides benchmarks for moving LRAs from the

manifolds (PMs) for the design of low-dimensional suboptimal controllers to
optimal control problems of nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs) of
parabolic type. Given a finite horizon $[0,T]$ and a low-mode truncation of the
PDE, a PM provides an approximate parameterization of the uncontrolled high
modes by the controlled low ones so that the unexplained high-mode energy is
reduced, in an $L^2$-sense, when this parameterization is applied. Analytic
formulas of such PMs are derived by application of the method of pullback
approximation of the high-modes (Chekroun, Liu, and Wang, 2013,
http://arxiv.org/pdf/1310.3896v1.pdf). These formulas allow for an effective
derivation of reduced ODE systems, aimed to model the evolution of the low-mode
truncation of the controlled state variable, where the high-mode part is
approximated by the PM function applied to the low modes. A priori error
estimates between the resulting PM-based low-dimensional suboptimal controller
$u_R^\ast$ and the optimal controller $u^*$ are derived. These estimates
demonstrate that the closeness of $u_R^\ast$ to $u^*$ is mainly conditioned on
two factors: (i) the parameterization defect of a given PM, associated
respectively with $u_R^\ast$ and $u^*$; and (ii) the energy kept in the high
modes of the PDE solution either driven by $u_R^\ast$ or $u^*$ itself. The
practical performances of such PM-based suboptimal controllers are numerically
assessed for various optimal control problems associated with a Burgers-type
equation. The numerical results show that a PM-based reduced system allows for
the design of suboptimal controllers with good performances provided that the
associated parameterization defects and energy kept in the high modes are small
enough, in agreement with the rigorous results.

new interesting mechanism for breaking scale symmetry in 4-D theories of

motion which lead to an integration constant the breaks the scale symmetry,
while introducing terms of the form $eG ln K$ , $e$ being the determinant of
the vierbein, $G$ being the Gauss Bonnet scalar and $K$ being scalar functions
of the fields transforming like $K \rightarrow cK $ (where c is a constant)

divergence and therefore leads to breaking of scale invariance due to
gravitational instantons. The topological density constructed out of gauge
field strengths $\varepsilon^{\mu\nu\alpha\beta}F^a_{\mu\nu}F^a_{\alpha\beta}$
can be coupled to the dilaton field linearly to produce a scale invariant term
up to a total divergence. The scale symmetry can be broken by Yang Mills
instantons which lead to a very small vacuum energy for our Universe.

one--dimensional hyperbolic conservation law subject to a point constraint. We
investigate how the regularity of the constraint operator impacts the
well--posedness of the problem, namely in the case, relevant for numerical
applications, of a discretized exit capacity. We devote particular attention to
the case in which the constraint is given by a non--local operator depending on
the solution itself. We provide several explicit examples. We also give the
detailed proof of some results announced in the paper [Andreainov, Donadello,

calculations so that it is readable to both specialists and nonspecialists in
this area of research. A brief derivation of the path integral formulation of
quantum mechanics in its original form using the orthonormal position and
momentum basis is reviewed. For spin systems such as single molecule magnets,
the formulation of path integral requires the use of non-orthonormal spin
coherent state in $(2s+1)$ dimensional Hilbert space, the coordinate
independent and the coordinate dependent form of the spin coherent state path
integral is derived. These two forms of spin coherent state path integral are
applied to the tunneling of single molecule magnets through its magnetic
anisotropy barrier. Most experimental and numerical results are presented. The
suppression of tunneling for half-odd integer spin (spin-parity effect) at zero
magnetic field is derived from both forms, which shows that this result
(spin-parity effect) is independent of the coordinate. At nonzero magnetic
field we present both the experimental and the theoretical results of the
oscillation of tunneling splitting as a function of the applied magnetic field
applied along the spin hard anisotropy axis direction. The experimental and the
theoretical results of the tunneling in antiferromagnetic exchange coupled
dimer model are also reviewed. As the spin coherent state path integral
formalism is a semi-classical method, an alternative exact mapping of a spin
system to a particle in a potential field (effective potential method) is
derived. This effective potential method allows for the investigation of phase
transition of the escape rate in spin systems.

sky over the celestial sphere. Since measurements are made over an irregularly
sampled Fourier plane, synthesising an intensity image from interferometric
measurements requires substantial processing. Furthermore there are distortions
that have to be corrected. In this thesis, a new high-performance image
synthesis tool (imaging tool) for radio interferometry is developed.
Implemented in C++ and CUDA, the imaging tool achieves unprecedented
performance by means of Graphics Processing Units (GPUs). The imaging tool is
divided into several components, and the back-end handling numerical
calculations is generalised in a new framework. A new feature termed
compression arbitrarily increases the performance of an already highly
efficient GPU-based implementation of the w-projection algorithm. Compression
takes advantage of the behaviour of oversampled convolution functions and the
baseline trajectories. A CPU-based component prepares data for the GPU which is
multi-threaded to ensure maximum use of modern multi-core CPUs. Best
performance can only be achieved if all hardware components in a system do work
in parallel. The imaging tool is designed such that disk I/O and work on CPU
and GPUs is done concurrently. Test cases show that the imaging tool performs
nearly 100$\times$ faster than another general CPU-based imaging tool.
Unfortunately, the tool is limited in use since deconvolution and A-projection
are not yet supported. It is also limited by GPU memory. Future work will
implement deconvolution and A-projection, whilst finding ways of overcoming the
memory limitation.

processes, and the amount of the water loss have been poorly constrained.
Recent technical developments of ion-microprobe analysis of martian meteorites
have provided accurate estimation of hydrogen isotope compositions (D/H) of
martian water reservoirs at the time when the meteorites formed. Based on the
D/H data from the meteorites, this study demonstrates that the water loss
during the pre-Noachian (>41-99 m global equivalent layers, GEL) was more
significant than in the rest of martian history (>10-53 m GEL). Combining our
results with geological and geomorphological evidence for ancient oceans, we
propose that undetected subsurface water/ice (~100-1000 m GEL) should have
existed, and it exceeds the observable present water inventory (~20-30 m GEL)

high resolution hydrodynamical cosmological simulation which includes stellar
and AGN feedback in a volume of $(100{h^{-1}\mathrm{Mpc}})^3$. We consider
redshift evolution from $z=1$ to $0.06$ and mass evolution within the range of
subhalo masses, $10^{10} -6.0 \times 10^{14.0}{h^{-1}M_{\odot}}$. The shapes of
the dark matter distributions are generally more round than the shapes defined
by stellar matter. The projected root-mean-square (RMS) ellipticity per
component for stellar matter is measured to be $e_\text{rms} = 0.28$ at $z=0.3$
for $M_{subhalo}> 10^{12.0}{h^{-1}M_{\odot}}$, which compares favourably with
observational measurements. We find that the shapes of stellar and dark matter
are more round for less massive subhalos and at lower redshifts. By directly
measuring the relative orientation of the stellar matter and dark matter of
subgroups, we find that, on average, the misalignment between the two
components is larger for less massive subhalos. The mean misalignment angle
varies from $\sim 30^{\circ}-10^{\circ}$ for $M \sim 10^{10} - 10^{14}
{h^{-1}M_{\odot}}$ and shows a weak dependence on redshift. We also compare the
misalignment angles in central and satellite subhalos at fixed subhalo mass,
and find that centrals are more misaligned than satellites. We present fitting
formulae for the shapes of dark and stellar matter in subhalos and also the
probability distributions of misalignment angles.

fact, and its implications considered, though further experimental verification
is required. In the simplest inflation models $r=0.2$ implies $H_I=1.1\times
10^{14}\text{ GeV}$. If the axion decay constant $f_a<H_I/2\pi$ constraints on
the dark matter (DM) abundance alone rule out the QCD axion as DM for $m_a

uncertainty). If $f_a>H_I/2\pi$ then vacuum fluctuations of the axion field
place conflicting demands on axion DM: isocurvature constraints require a DM
abundance which is too small to be reached when the back reaction of
fluctuations is included. High $f_a$ QCD axions are thus ruled out. Constraints
on axion-like particles, as a function of their mass and DM fraction, are also
considered. For heavy axions with $m_a\gtrsim 10^{-22}\text{ eV}$ we find
$\Omega_a/\Omega_d\lesssim 10^{-3}$, with stronger constraints on heavier
axions. Lighter axions, however, are allowed and (inflationary)
model-independent constraints from the CMB temperature power spectrum and large
scale structure are stronger than those implied by tensor modes.

volumes by coupling engineered optical transitions in semiconductor
heterostructures (e.g., quantum wells) to metasurface resonances via near
fields. It has also been shown that different resonator shapes may lead to
different Rabi splittings, though this has not yet been well explained. In this
paper, our aim is to understand the correlation between resonator shape and
Rabi splitting, and in particular determine and quantify the physical
parameters that affect strong coupling by developing an equivalent circuit
network model whose elements describe energy and dissipation. Because of the
subwavelength dimension of each metasurface element, we resort to the
quasi-static (electrostatic) description of the near-field and hence define an
equivalent capacitance associated to each dipolar element of a flat
metasurface, and we show that this is also able to accurately model the
phenomenology involved in strong coupling between the metasurface and the
intersubband transitions in quantum wells. We show that the spectral properties
and stored energy of a metasurface/quantum-well system obtained using our model
are in good agreement with both full-wave simulation and experimental results.
We then analyze metasurfaces made of three different resonator geometries and
observe that the magnitude of the Rabi splitting increases with the resonator
capacitance in agreement with our theory, providing a phenomenological
explanation for the resonator shape dependence of the strong coupling process.

Yule trees, but it remains mostly unknown how these properties affect sequence
and trait patterns observed at the tips of the phylogenetic tree. Understanding
the interplay between speciation and mutation under simple models of evolution
is essential for deriving valid phylogenetic inference methods and gives
insight into the optimal design of phylogenetic studies. In this work, we
derive the probability distribution of interspecies covariance under Brownian
motion and Ornstein-Uhlenbeck models of phenotypic change on a Yule tree. We
compute the probability distribution of the number of mutations shared between
two randomly chosen taxa in a Yule tree under discrete Markov mutation models.
Our results suggest summary measures of phylogenetic information content,
illuminate the correlation between site patterns in sequences or traits of
related organisms, and provide heuristics for experimental design and
reconstruction of phylogenetic trees.

the large overdensity of spectroscopically confirmed members,
$\delta_{gal}=10.5\pm2.8$, and a significant overdensity in photometric
redshift members. The halo mass of this protocluster is estimated, by a variety
of methods, to be roughly $3\times10^{14}$ $\mathcal{M}_{\odot}$ at $z\sim3.3$,
which, evolved to $z=0$ results in a halo mass rivaling or exceeding that of
the Coma cluster. The properties of 19 spectroscopically confirmed member
galaxies are compared with a large sample of VUDS/VVDS galaxies in lower
density field environments at similar redshifts. We find tentative evidence for
an excess of redder, brighter, and more massive galaxies within the confines of
the protocluster relative to the field population, which suggests that we may
be observing the beginning of environmentally-induced quenching. The properties
of these galaxies are investigated, including a discussion of the brightest
protocluster galaxy which appears to be undergoing vigorous coeval nuclear and
starburst activity. The remaining member galaxies appear to have
characteristics which are largely similar to the field population. Though we
find weaker evidence of the suppression of the median star formation rates
amongst and differences in stacked spectra of member galaxies with respect to
the field, we defer any conclusions of these trends to future work with the
ensemble of protostructures that are found in the full VUDS sample.

in visible and infrared pair of video sequences for multiple targets. In
multimodal image analysis like image fusion systems, color and IR sensors are
placed close to each other and capture a same scene simultaneously, but the
videos are not properly aligned by default because of different fields of view,
image capturing information, working principle and other camera specifications.
Because the scenes are usually not planar, alignment needs to be performed
continuously by extracting relevant common information. In this paper, we
approximate the shape of the targets by polygons and use affine transformation
for aligning the two video sequences. After background subtraction, keypoints
on the contour of the foreground blobs are detected using DCE (Discrete Curve
Evolution)technique. These keypoints are then described by the local shape at
each point of the obtained polygon. The keypoints are matched based on the
convexity of polygon's vertices and Euclidean distance between them. Only good
matches for each local shape polygon in a frame, are kept. To achieve a global
affine transformation that maximises the overlapping of infrared and visible
foreground pixels, the matched keypoints of each local shape polygon are stored
temporally in a buffer for a few number of frames. The matrix is evaluated at
each frame using the temporal buffer and the best matrix is selected, based on
an overlapping ratio criterion. Our experimental results demonstrate that this
method can provide highly accurate registered images and that we outperform a
previous related method.

show an oscillatory behavior, controlled by the scaling exponent of the

2012 explosion. During the initial 2012a phase, when the source spectrum
exhibits broad P-Cygni lines, we measure a V-band polarization of P~0.9% at a
position angle of ~166 deg, indicating substantial asphericity for the 2012a
outflow. Near the subsequent peak of the 2012b phase, when the spectrum shows
signs of intense interaction with circumstellar material (CSM), we measure
P~1.7% at a position angle of 72 deg, indicating a separate physical component
of polarization, which has a higher degree of asphericity than the 2012a
outflow and an orthogonal axis of symmetry on the sky. Around 30 days past
peak, which is coincident with a bump in the declining light curve, we measure
P~0.7% and significant variations in P across some broad lines, particularly
HeI/NaI. By 60 days past peak the source appears to be approaching a low value
of interstellar polarization (P<0.2%). The results are consistent with a
scenario in which a potentially bipolar explosion during 2012a impacts a
toroidal distribution of CSM, thereby causing the 2012b brightening.
Orthogonality between the 2012a and 2012b geometries is inconsistent with the
hypothesis that the 2012a event launched the CSM that was hit 40 days later by
material from the 2012b event. Rather, the aspherical CSM probably has a
separate origin associated with the outbursts of the stellar progenitor during
prior years. Previous calculations that assumed spherical symmetry for the CSM
have underestimated the required explosion energy, as the results suggest that
<10% of the fast SN ejecta participated in strong CSM interaction during the
2012b phase. In light of the spectropolarimetric results, a kinetic energy of
1e51 erg for the ejecta is difficult to avoid, supporting the interpretation
that the 2012 outburst was the result of a core-collapse supernova explosion

potential formalism. We discover new models of emergent cosmology which satisfy
the constraints posed by the cosmic microwave background (CMB). We demonstrate
that, within the framework of modified gravity, the emergent scenario can arise
in a universe which is spatially open/closed. By contrast, in general
relativity (GR) emergent cosmology arises from a spatially closed past-eternal
Einstein Static Universe (ESU). In GR the ESU is unstable, which creates fine
tuning problems for emergent cosmology. However, modified gravity models
including Braneworld models, Loop Quantum Cosmology (LQC) and Asymptotically
Free Gravity result in a stable ESU. Consequently, in these models emergent
cosmology arises from a larger class of initial conditions including those in
which the universe eternally oscillates about the ESU fixed point. We
demonstrate that such an oscillating universe is necessarily accompanied by
graviton production. For a large region in parameter space graviton production
is enhanced through a parametric resonance, casting serious doubts as to
whether this emergent scenario can be past-eternal.

disk sharply transitions from being radially transparent to opaque (the
'transition region'). Such conditions may exist at the inner edges of
transitional disks around T Tauri stars and accretion disks around AGNs. We
derive the criterion for this instability, which we term the 'irradiation
instability', or IRI. We also present the linear growth rate as a function of
beta, the ratio between radiation force and gravity, and c_s, the sound speed
of the disk, obtained using two methods: a semi-analytic analysis of the
linearized equations and a numerical simulation using the GPU-accelerated
hydrodynamical code PEnGUIn. In particular, we find that IRI occurs at beta~0.1
if the transition region extends as wide as ~0.05r, and at higher beta values
if it is wider. This threshold value applies to c_s ranging from 3% of the
Keplerian orbital speed to 5%, and becomes higher if c_s is lower. Furthermore,
in the nonlinear evolution of the instability, disks with a large beta and
small c_s exhibit 'clumping', extreme local surface density enhancements that
can reach over ten times the initial disk surface density.

heights of the different gas tracers, such as HI and CO, are a measure of these

important for understanding those ISM components not traced by CO or HI. We
determine the average distribution of [CII] perpendicular to the plane in the
inner Galactic disk and compare it to the distributions of other key gas
tracers, such as CO and HI. We calculated the vertical, z, distribution of
[CII] in the inner Galactic disk by adopting a model for the emission that
combines the latitudinal, b, spectrally unresolved BICE survey, with the
spectrally resolved $Herschel$ Galactic plane survey of [CII] at b = 0 deg. Our
model assumed a Gaussian emissivity distribution vertical to the plane, and
related the distribution in z to that of the latitude b using the spectrally
resolved [CII] Herschel survey as the boundary solution for the emissivity at
b=0 deg. We find that the distribution of [CII] perpendicular to the plane has
a full-width half-maximum of 172 pc, larger than that of CO, which averages
~110 pc in the inner Galaxy, but smaller than that of HI, ~230 pc, and is
offset by -28 pc. We explain the difference in distributions of [CII], CO, and
HI as due to [CII] tracing a mix of ISM components. Models of hydrostatic

velocity profile width of $\sim 130 ~\rm km~s^{-1}$ FWHM is too narrow for the
molecular cloud sto be supported in the galaxy by dynamic pressure. The gas may
instead be supported in a rotating, turbulent disk oriented nearly face-on.
Roughly $10^{10}~\rm M_\odot$ of molecular gas is projected $3-10 ~\rm kpc$ to
the north-west and to the east of the nucleus with line of sight velocities
lying between $-250 ~\rm km~s^{-1}$ to $+480 ~\rm km~s^{-1}$ with respect to
the systemic velocity. The high velocity gas may be either inflowing or
outflowing. However, the absence of high velocity gas toward the nucleus that
would be expected in a steady inflow, and its bipolar distribution on either
side of the nucleus, are more naturally explained as outflow. Star formation
and radiation from the AGN are both incapable of driving an outflow of this
magnitude. If so, the molecular outflow may be associated a hot outflow on
larger scales reported by Kirkpatrick and colleagues. The molecular gas flow
rate of approximately $200~\rm M_\odot ~yr^{-1}$ is comparable to the star
formation rate of $100-180~\rm M_\odot ~yr^{-1}$ in the central disk. How radio
bubbles would lift dense molecular gas in their updrafts, how much gas will be
lost to the BCG, and how much will return to fuel future star formation and AGN
activity are poorly understood. Our results imply that radio-mechanical (radio
mode) feedback not only heats hot atmospheres surrounding elliptical galaxies
and BCGs, it is able to sweep higher density molecular gas away from their

observations over a much longer timescale (6 years) and a much larger flux
range than is afforded by other observatories. At very low luminosities the
spectrum is very soft, becoming rapidly harder as the luminosity increases and
then, above a particular luminosity, softening again. At a given flux level,
the scatter in hardness ratio is not very large, meaning that the spectral
shape is largely determined by the luminosity. The spectra were therefore
summed in luminosity bins and fitted with a variety of models. The best fitting
model consists of two power laws, one unabsorbed and another, more luminous,
which is absorbed. In this model, we find a range of intrinsic 0.5-10.0 keV
luminosities of approximately 1.1-3.5 ergs/s, and a very large range of
absorbing columns, of approximately 10^22 - 10^24 cm^-2. Interestingly, we find
that the absorbing column decreases with increasing luminosity, but that this
result is not due to changes in ionisation. We suggest that these observations
might be interpreted in terms of a wind model in which the launch radius varies
as a function of ionising flux and disc temperature and therefore moves out
with increasing accretion rate, i.e. increasing X-ray luminosity. Thus,
depending on the inclination angle of the disc relative to the observer, the
absorbing column may decrease as the accretion rate goes up. The weaker,
unabsorbed, component may be a scattered component from the wind.

acceleration in clusters. We detect a puzzling, flat-spectrum, diffuse

explicitly demonstrating that the sample mobility is not necessarily a reliable

interest, mobility and quality may be controlled by different aspects of the
underlying disorder distribution, particularly since these systems are
dominated by long-range Coulomb disorder from both near and far random quenched

that there is no reason to expect a unique relationship between mobility and

deceptively simple question of whether the interaction-driven electronic
metal-insulator transition may be continuous remains enigmatic. Recent
experiments on two-dimensional materials suggest that when the insulator is a
quantum spin liquid, lack of magnetic long-range order on the insulating side
may cause the transition to be continuous, or only very weakly first order.
Motivated by this, we study a half-filled extended Hubbard model on a
triangular lattice strip geometry. We argue, through use of large-scale
numerical simulations and analytical bosonization, that this model harbors a
continuous (Kosterlitz-Thouless-like) quantum phase transition between a metal
and a gapless spin liquid characterized by a spinon Fermi surface, i.e., a
""spinon metal."" These results may provide a rare insight into the development
of Mott criticality in strongly interacting two-dimensional materials and
represent one of the first numerical demonstrations of a Mott insulating
quantum spin liquid phase in a genuinely electronic microscopic model.

redshift radio galaxy MRC 2104-242. We have selected Halpha emitters in a
7sq.arcmin field and compared the measured number density with that of a field
sample at similar redshift. We find that MRC 2104-242 lies in an overdensity of
galaxies that is 8.0 +/- 0.8 times the average density of a blank field,
suggesting it resides in a large-scale structure that may eventually collapse
to form a massive cluster. We find that there is more dust obscured star
formation in the protocluster galaxies than in similarly selected control field
galaxies and there is tentative evidence of a higher fraction of starbursting
galaxies in the denser environment. However, on average we do not find a
difference between the star formation rate (SFR)-mass relations of the
protocluster and field galaxies and so conclude that the SFR of these galaxies
at z~2.5 is governed predominantly by galaxy mass and not the host environment.
We also find that the stellar mass distribution of the protocluster galaxies is
skewed towards higher masses and there is a significant lack of galaxies at M <
10^10Msun within our small field of view. Based on the level of overdensity we
expect to find ~22 star forming galaxies below 10^10Msun in the protocluster
and do not detect any. This lack of low mass galaxies affects the level of
overdensity which we detect. If we only consider high mass (M > 10^10.5Msun)
galaxies, the density of the protocluster field increases to ~55 times the
control field density.

biology, we address mathematically the role of shear-dependent viscosities on
both the waving flagellar locomotion and ciliary transport by metachronal
waves. Using a two-dimensional waving sheet as model for the kinematics of a
flagellum or an array of cilia, and allowing for both normal and tangential
deformation of the sheet, we calculate the flow field induced by a
small-amplitude deformation of the sheet in a generalized Newtonian Carreau
fluid up to order four in the dimensionless waving amplitude. Shear-thinning
and shear-thickening fluids are seen to always induce opposite effects. When
the fluid is shear-thinning, the rate of working of the sheet against the fluid
is always smaller than in the Newtonian fluid, and the largest gain is obtained
for antiplectic metachronal waves. Considering a variety of deformation
kinematics for the sheet, we further show that in all cases transport by the
sheet is more efficiency in a shear-thinning fluid, and in most cases the
transport speed in the fluid is also increased. Comparing the order of
magnitude of the shear-thinning contributions with past work on elastic effects
as well as the magnitude of the Newtonian contributions, our theoretical
results suggest that the impact of shear-dependent viscosities on transport
could play a major biological role.

paper the influence of the rotation of the source - the pulsar - about its axis

is modeled by the spherical reflective screen and the compact source uniformly
rotating about its axis; the beam pattern (BP) of the source periodically runs
over the surface of the screen. Irradiation of the screen by the pulses

the speed of the BP passing over the companion surface. The possibility of
applying of the obtained results to the known X-ray accretion-powered pulsars

the galaxy's disk. A panchromatic spectral energy distribution was modelled for
each pixel and several dust scaling relations are investigated. We find, on a
sub-kpc scale, strong correlations between $M_d/M_\star$ and NUV-r, and between
$M_d/M_\star$ and $\mu_\star$ (the stellar mass surface density). Striking
similarities with corresponding relations based on integrated galaxies are
found. We decompose M31 in four macro-regions based on their FIR morphology;
the bulge, inner disk, star forming ring and the outer disk. All regions
closely follow the galaxy-scale average trends. The specific star formation
characteristics we derive for these macro-regions give strong hints of an
inside-out formation of the bulge-disk geometry, as well as an internal
downsizing process. However, within each macro-region, a great diversity in
individual micro-regions is found. Furthermore, we confirm that dust in the
bulge of M31 is heated only by the old stellar populations. In general, the
local dust scaling relations indicate that the dust content in M31 is
maintained by a subtle interplay of past and present star formation. The
similarity with galaxy-based relations strongly suggests that they are in situ
correlations, with underlying processes that must be local in nature. (Abriged)

our understanding of protein crystallization. But they have also left open
questions regarding the protein phase behavior and self-assembly kinetics, such
as why (nearly) identical crystallization conditions sometimes result in the
formation of different crystal forms. Here, we develop a patchy particle model
with competing sets of patches that provides a microscopic explanation of this
phenomenon. We identify different regimes in which one or two crystal forms can
coexist with a low-density fluid. Using analytical approximations, we extend
our findings to different crystal phases, providing a general framework for
treating protein crystallization when multiple crystal forms compete. Our
results also suggest different experimental routes for targeting a specific
crystal form, and for reducing the dynamical competition between the two forms,
thus facilitating protein crystal assembly.

frequency regimes where both radiation spectra are nearly identical, which for
Compton scattering relates to the process which preserves the electron spin.
Although the radiation spectra are nearly identical, the corresponding
probability amplitudes exhibit different global phases. This has pronounced
consequences, which we demonstrate by investigating temporal power
distributions in both cases. We show that, contrary to Thomson scattering, it
is not always possible to synthesize short laser pulses from Compton radiation.
This happens when the global phase of the Compton amplitude varies in a
nonlinear way with the frequency of emitted photons. We also demonstrate that
while the Compton process driven by a non-chirped laser pulse can generate
chirped bursts of radiation, this is not the case for the Thomson process. In
principle, both processes can lead to a generation of coherent frequency combs
when single or multiple driving laser pulses collide with electrons. Once we
synthesize these combs into short bursts of radiation, we can control them, for
instance, by changing the time delay between the driving pulses.

study for understanding accretion engines. Taking a step along this path, we
analyze simulations of the magnetorotational instability (MRI) by calculating
energy and stress power spectra in stratified isothermal shearing box
simulations in several new ways. We divide our boxes in two regions, disc and
corona where the disc is the MRI unstable region and corona is the magnetically
dominated region. We calculate the fractional power in different quantities,
including magnetic energy and Maxwell stresses and find that they are dominated
by contributions from the lowest wave numbers. This is even more dramatic for
the corona than the disc, suggesting that transport in the corona region is
dominated by larger structures than the disc. By calculating averaged power
spectra in one direction of $k$ space at a time, we also show that the MRI
turbulence is strongly anisotropic on large scales when analyzed by this
method, but isotropic on small scales. Although the shearing box itself is
meant to represent a local section of an accretion disc, the fact that the
stress and energy are dominated by the largest scales highlights that the
locality is not captured within the box. This helps to quantify the intuitive
importance of global simulations for addressing the question of locality of
transport, for which similar analyses can be performed.

The proposed technique has two distinctive features. First, the model reduction
strategy is tailored to inverse problems: the snapshots used to construct the
reduced-order model are computed adaptively from the posterior distribution.
Posterior exploration and model reduction are thus pursued simultaneously.
Second, to avoid repeated evaluations of the full-scale numerical model as in a
standard MCMC method, we couple the full-scale model and the reduced-order
model together in the MCMC algorithm. This maintains accurate inference while
reducing its overall computational cost. In numerical experiments considering
steady-state flow in a porous medium, the data-driven reduced-order model
achieves better accuracy than a reduced-order model constructed using the
classical approach. It also improves posterior sampling efficiency by several
orders of magnitude compared to a standard MCMC method.

primordial gravitational waves from cosmic inflation. Measuring B-modes
requires dramatic improvements in sensitivity combined with exquisite control
of systematics. The BICEP2 telescope observed from the South Pole with a 26~cm
aperture and cold, on-axis, refractive optics. BICEP2 also adopted a new
detector design in which beam-defining slot antenna arrays couple to
transition-edge sensor (TES) bolometers, all fabricated on a common substrate.
The antenna-coupled TES detectors supported scalable fabrication and
multiplexed readout that allowed BICEP2 to achieve a high detector count of 500
bolometers at 150 GHz, giving unprecedented sensitivity to B-modes at degree
angular scales. After optimization of detector and readout parameters, BICEP2
achieved an instrument noise-equivalent temperature of 15.8 $\mu$K sqrt(s). The
full data set reached Stokes Q and U map depths of 87.2 nK in square-degree
pixels (5.2 $\mu$K arcmin) over an effective area of 384 square degrees within
a 1000 square degree field. These are the deepest CMB polarization maps at
degree angular scales to date. The power spectrum analysis presented in a
companion paper has resulted in a significant detection of B-mode polarization
at degree scales.

by the isotropic form of Cazacu et al. (2006) criterion that accounts for SD

axisymmetric tensile loadings corresponding to fixed values of the stress
triaxiality for the two possible values of the Lode parameter, LP. For moderate
and high stress triaxialities, it is shown that for materials for which the
matrix tensile strength is larger than its compressive strength (k > 0), under
tensile loadings corresponding at LP=1 the void growth rate is much faster than
in the case of tensile loadings at LP=-1. The opposite holds true for materials
with matrix tensile strength lower than its compressive strength (k< 0). This
drastic difference in porosity evolution is explained by the distribution of
the local plastic strain and stresses, which are markedly different than in a
von Mises material (i.e. no SD effects of the matrix).

mechanism based on industry convergence and technology progress. Firstly, we
use self-organization method and Haken Model to establish synergetic evolution
equations, select technology progress and industry convergence as the key
variables of industry evolution system; then use patent licensing data of
china's listed ICT companies to measure industry convergence rate and apply DEA
Malmquist index method to calculate technology progress level; furthermore
apply simultaneous equation estimation method to investigate the synergetic
industry evolution process. From 2002 to 2012, China's ICT industry develops
rapidly; it has the most obvious convergence and powerful technology progress
compared with other industries. We choose china's listed ICT industry to make
empirical analysis. Our main findings are: a) technology progress is the order
parameter which dominates industry system evolution. Moreover, industry
convergence is the control parameter which is influenced by technology
progress; b) Development of technology progress is the core factor for causing
evolution of industry system, and industry convergence is the outcome of
technology progress; c) Especially, it is important that the dominated role of
technology progress will be sustained, even though in the environment of
convergence, companies also need focus on self-innovation, rather than only
adapt to the new industry evolution trend.

us humans as they do, i.e. as bounded entities occupying space and persisting
through time', starting from our knowledge of quantum theory, how it affects
the behavior of such customary macroscopic entities, and how it influences our
perception of them. For this purpose, we approach the question from three
perspectives. Firstly, we look at the situation from the standard quantum
angle, more specifically the de Broglie wavelength analysis of the behavior of
macroscopic entities, indicate how a problem with spin and identity arises, and
illustrate how both play a fundamental role in well-established experimental
quantum-macroscopical phenomena, such as Bose-Einstein condensates. Secondly,
we analyze how the question is influenced by our result in axiomatic quantum
theory, which proves that standard quantum theory is structurally incapable of
describing separated entities. Thirdly, we put forward our new 'conceptual
quantum interpretation', including a highly detailed reformulation of the
question to confront the new insights and views that arise with the foregoing
analysis. At the end of the final section, a nuanced answer is given that can
be summarized as follows. The specific and very classical perception of human
seeing -- light as a geometric theory -- and human touching -- only ruled by
Pauli's exclusion principle -- plays a role in our perception of macroscopic
entities as ontologically stable entities in space. To ascertain quantum
behavior in such macroscopic entities, we will need measuring apparatuses
capable of its detection. Future experimental research will have to show if
sharp quantum effects -- as they occur in smaller entities -- appear to be
ontological aspects of customary macroscopic entities.

systems, fails to capture the main physics: the multiple scattering of the
electromagnetic waves between the two LSPs, which significantly modifies the

Doping the half-filled Hubbard model results in a change of the

phase of incommensurate SDWs. Previous studies of this phase mainly rely on
static mean field calculations. In this paper, we will use large-scale iDMFT
calculations to study properties of SDWs in the Hubbard model. A great
advantage of iDMFT over static mean field approaches is the inclusion of local
screening effects and the easy access to dynamical correlation functions.
Furthermore, this technique is not restricted to the Hubbard model, but can be
easily used to study incommensurate phases in various strongly correlated
materials.

systems---represented by such standards as SNMP for network management, and
WSDM for systems based on service oriented computing (SOC)---relies on the
components of the managed system to cooperate in the management process, by
providing the managers with the means to monitor their state and activities,
and to control their behavior. Unfortunately, the trust thus placed in the
cooperation of the managed components is unwarranted for many types of
systems---such as systems based on SOA---making the conventional management of
such systems unreliable and insecure.
  This paper introduces a radically new approach to the management of
distributed systems, called governance-based management (GBM), which is based
on a middleware that can govern the exchange of messages between system
components. GBM has a substantial ability to manage distributed systems, in a
reliable and secure manner, even without any trustworthy cooperation of the
managed components.
  And it can fully incorporate the conventional management techniques wherever
such cooperation can be trusted. GBM also supports a reflexive mode of
management, which manages the management process itself, making it safer.
However, GBM is still a work in progress, as it raises several open problems
that needs to be addressed before this management technique can be put to
practice.

In contrast to engineered bulk auxetics, this behavior is intrinsic for single

where the pucker can be regarded as a re-entrant structure that is comprised of
two coupled orthogonal hinges. As a result of this atomic structure, a negative
Poisson's ratio is observed in the out-of-plane direction under uniaxial
deformation in the direction parallel to the pucker, with the Poisson's ratio
becoming increasingly negative with both increased tension and compression. The
puckered structure also results in highly anisotropic in-plane Poisson's

by the uniaxial tension, and is completely closed at epsilon=0.145; while the
biaxial tension only has limited effect on the phonon bandgap. We also
demonstrate the compression induced buckling for the monolayer MoS2. The
critical strain for buckling is extracted from the band structure analysis of
the flexure mode in the monolayer MoS2 and is further verified by molecular

very useful when the initial values of the dynamical variables are not far away

local analysis can not provide the informations that which one the system will

compromises the integrity of the cell because of tunnel oxide degradation.
While degradation is commonly measured in the number of program/erase cycles

process. By managing the amount of charge written to the floating gate to
maintain a constant read-channel mutual information, Flash lifetime can be
extended. This paper proposes an overall system approach based on information

We then exploit these divergences for classification purposes. Our experiments

rather distributed over the entire galaxy, including the inner region. The CC
SNR candidates are brighter in H$\alpha$ and [SII] than the Type Ia SNR
candidates. We derive a cumulative size distribution of the SNR candidates,
finding that the distribution of the candidates with 17 $< D <$ 50 pc is fitted
well by a power law with the power law index $\alpha = 2.53\pm0.04$. This
indicates that most of the SNR candidates identified in this study appear to be
in the Sedov-Taylor phase. The [SII]:H$\alpha$ distribution of the SNR
candidates is bimodal, with peaks at [SII]:H$\alpha$ $\sim$ 0.4 and $\sim$ 0.9.
The properties of these SNR candidates vary little with the galactocentric
distance. The H$\alpha$ and [SII] surface brightnesses show a good correlation
with the X-ray luminosity of the SNR candidates that are center-bright. The SNR
candidates with X-ray counterparts have higher surface brightnesses in
H$\alpha$ and [SII] and smaller sizes than those without such counterparts.

Strong depletions in $\delta$($^{138}$Ba/$^{136}$Ba) values are found, down to

the $^{13}$C pocket than is normally used. The dependence of

In addition, we provide constraints on the $^{22}$Ne$(\alpha,n)^{25}$Mg rate in
the stellar temperature regime relevant to AGB stars, based on
$\delta$($^{134}$Ba/$^{136}$Ba) values of mainstream grains. We found two
nominally mainstream grains with strongly negative
$\delta$($^{134}$Ba/$^{136}$Ba) values that cannot be explained by any of the
current AGB model calculations. Instead, such negative values are consistent
with the intermediate neutron capture process ($i$-process), which is activated
by the Very Late Thermal Pulse (VLTP) during the post-AGB phase and
characterized by a neutron density much higher than the $s$-process. These two
grains may have condensed around post-AGB stars. Finally, we report abundances
of two $p$-process isotopes, $^{130}$Ba and $^{132}$Ba, in single SiC grains.
These isotopes are destroyed in the $s$-process in AGB stars. By comparing
their abundances with respect to that of $^{135}$Ba, we conclude that there is
no measurable decay of $^{135}$Cs ($t_{1/2}$= 2.3 Ma) to $^{135}$Ba in
individual SiC grains, indicating condensation of barium, but not cesium into
SiC grains before $^{135}$Cs decayed.

not by in situ star formation, with which Z ~ N_{HI}^{0.4} is expected from the

metals observed in absorbers being deposited dominantly from nearby galaxies by

that language exactly. Pattern avoidance in permutations was used historically

deactivation of these under-utilized BSs is regarded as the key to reducing
network power consumption; however, the remaining active BSs should increase
their transmit power in order to fill network coverage holes that result from
BS switching off. This paper investigates the optimal balance between such
beneficial and harmful effects of BS switching off in terms of minimizing the
network power consumption, through comprehensively considering the spatial BS
distribution, BS transmit power, BS power consumption behaviors, radio
propagation environments, and frequency reuse. When BSs are deployed according
to a homogeneous Poisson point process, the suboptimal and approximated design

phase transition phenomena occurring in black holes defined in an
Anti-de-Sitter (AdS) space. Based on the fundamental principles of
thermodynamics and considering a grand canonical framework we examine various
aspects of the phase transition phenomena occurring in AdS black holes. We
analytically check that this phase transition between the smaller and larger
mass black holes obey Ehrenfest relations defined at the critical point and
hence confirm a second order phase transition. This include both the rotating
and charged black holes in Einstein gravity. Apart from studying these issues,
based on a canonical framework, we also investigate the critical behavior in
charged AdS black holes. The scaling laws for these black holes are found to be
compatible with the static scaling hypothesis. Finally, based on the usual
framework of AdS/CFT duality, we investigate the phase transition phenomena
occurring in charged hairy black holes defined in an asymptotically AdS space.
Based on analytic calculations, and using the AdS/CFT dictionary, we explicitly
compute the order-parameter for the dual CFT close to the critical point of the
phase transition and found that the critical exponent associated with the
condensation is $\frac{1}{2}$, which is the universal result of the mean field
theory. Moreover, we also find that in the presence of an external magnetic
field, the dual CFT exhibit a perfect diamagnetism at low temperatures, which
may be regarded as the reminiscent of the so called Meissner effect.

recent years. Different from traditional cellular communication, its high
mobility makes it essential to implement power allocation along the time. In
the HSR case, the transmission rate depends greatly on the distance between the
base station (BS) and the train. As a result, the train receives a time varying
data rate service when passing by a BS. It is clear that the most efficient
power allocation will spend all the power when the train is nearest from the
BS, which will cause great unfairness along the time. On the other hand, the
channel inversion allocation achieves the best fairness in terms of constant
rate transmission. However, its power efficiency is much lower. Therefore, the
power efficiency and the fairness along time are two incompatible objects. For
the HSR cellular system considered in this paper, a trade-off between the two
is achieved by proposing a temporal proportional fair power allocation scheme.
Besides, near optimal closed form solution and one algorithm finding the
$\epsilon$-optimal allocation are presented.

parts of the data are excluded up front for efficiency. Our design enables
searches to focus on specific areas on the sky to further speed up the process.
Another important advantage of the new method over traditional techniques is
its ability to quickly detect dropouts, i.e., the missing components that are
in the observed regions of the celestial sphere but did not reach the detection
limit in some observations. These often provide invaluable insight into the
spectral energy distribution of the matched sources but rarely available in

synthetic likelihood parameters. Our numerical experiments demonstrate that the
precomputed binding function dramatically improves the scalability of ABC,
reducing the average runtime required for model fitting from 71 hours to only 7

both for spherical and deformed cases, on the level density parameter was
investigated by examining the local success of the global parameterizations of
eight different combinations of these terms. Among these combinations, the sum
of the central, spin-orbit, harmonic oscillator and Coulomb potentials, gives
the most accurate predictions compared with experimental data. The local
selections of the global parameterizations show that the single-particle
models, which are based on Woods-Saxon potential as the main term, are more
suitable candidates than the models based on harmonic oscillator potential to
extrapolate away far from stability. Also it can be concluded that the
contribution of the Coulomb interaction, both around the closed and open shells
is not neglectable.

Malliavin calculus is employed to derive a maximum principle for the optimal

also investigate the mean-field type optimal control problems for systems
driven by mean-field type stochastic differential equations (SDEs in short)
with jump processes, in which the coefficients contain not only the state

intervening dust are investigated via spectropolarimetry. The spectra of
SN2008fp reveal a complex of diffuse atomic clouds at radial velocities in line
with the systematic velocities of the host galaxy (~1700 km/s). A translucent
(A_V ~ 1.5 mag) cloud is detected at a heliocentric velocity of 1770 km/s This
cold dense cloud is rich in dense atomic gas tracers, molecules, as well as
diffuse interstellar bands. We have detected both C2 and C3 for the first time
in a galaxy beyond the Local Group. The CN (0,0) band line ratios are used to
derive an in-situ measurement of the cosmic background radiation temperature in
an external galaxy; this gives an excitation temperature of T = 2.9 +- 0.3 K.
The interstellar polarization law deviates significantly from what is observed
in the Galaxy, indicating substantial differences in the composition or size
distribution of dust grains in the SN2008fp host galaxy. C2 is used to probe
the cold diffuse ISM density and temperature. The lack of variability in the
extra-galactic absorption line profiles over a period of one month implies that
the absorbing material is not circumstellar and thus not affected directly by
the SN event. Also it shows that there are no significant density variation in
the small-scale structure of the molecular cloud down to 100 AU.

spherically symmetric spacetimes (general covariance is in the $t-r$ plane)
belonging to the class where the spherically symmetric Einstein-Hilbert theory
is modified by the presence of $g_{\theta\theta}$ dependent functions. In $3+1$
dimensional vacuum spacetimes there is three-fold infinity of freedom in
constructing such theories as revealed by the presence of three arbitrary
$g_{\theta\theta}$ dependent functions in the Hamiltonian (matter Hamiltonian
also has the corresponding freedom). This result is not a contradiction to the
theorem of Hojman et. al. [1] which is applicable to the full theory whereas
the above conclusion is for symmetry reduced sector of the theory (which has a
much reduced phase space). In the full theory where there are no special
symmetries, the result of Hojman et. al. will continue to hold. In the process
we also show that theories where the constraint algebra is deformed by the
presence of $g_{\theta\theta}$ dependent functions - as is the case in the
presence of inverse triad corrections in loop quantum gravity - can always be
brought to the form where they obey the standard (undeformed) constraint
algebra by performing a suitable canonical transformation. We prove that
theories obtained after performing canonical transformation are inequivalent to
the symmetry reduced general relativity and that the resulting theories fall
within the purview of the theories mentioned above.

technologies, and sources based on colour centres in diamonds are among the

several limitations, thus few other defects have recently been considered. In
the present work, we characterize in detail native efficient single colour
centres emitting in the near infra-red in both standard IIa single-crystal and
electronic-grade polycrystalline commercial CVD diamond samples. In the former
case, a high-temperature annealing process in vacuum is necessary to induce the
formation/activation of luminescent centres with good emission properties,
while in the latter case the annealing process has marginal beneficial effects
on the number and performances of native centres in commercially available
samples. Although displaying significant variability in several photo physical
properties (emission wavelength, emission rate instabilities, saturation
behaviours), these centres generally display appealing photophysical properties
for applications as single photon sources: short lifetimes, high emission rates
and strongly polarized light. The native centres are tentatively attributed to
impurities incorporated in the diamond crystal during the CVD growth of
high-quality type IIa samples, and offer promising perspectives in
diamond-based photonics.

relative twist between field lines. Depending on the assumed length of coronal
magnetic field lines, the higher bound is found to be reasonably tight compared
with a Poynting flux estimate using an available vector magnetogram. It is also
close to the energy input required to explain conductive and radiative losses
in the active region corona. Based on similar analysis of a numerical
convection simulation, we suggest that observations with higher spatial
resolution are likely to bring the bound based on relative twist closer to the
first bound, but not to increase the first bound substantially. Finally, we put
an approximate upper bound on the magnetic energy by constructing a
hypothetical ``unrelaxed'' magnetic field with the correct field line
connectivity.

Initially, a spinor version of the Frenet equation is introduced in order to
describe the differential geometry of static three dimensional string-like
structures. Then its relation to the structure of the su(2) Lie algebra valued
Maurer-Cartan one-form is presented; while by introducing time evolution of the
string a Lax pair is obtained, as an integrability condition. In addition, it
is show how the Lax pair of the integrable nonlinear Schroedinger equation
becomes embedded into the Lax pair of the time extended spinor Frenet equation
and it is described how a spinor based projection operator formalism can be
used to construct the conserved quantities, in the case of the nonlinear
Schroedinger equation. Then the Lax pair structure of the time extended spinor
Frenet equation is related to properties of flat connections in a two

between the decomposed Yang-Mills and the Gauss-Godazzi equation that describes
surfaces in three dimensional ambient space is presented. In that context the
relation between isothermic surfaces and integrable models is discussed.

our approach DecLiNe (an acronym for DECay of LInks in NEtworks) aims to
predict link decay in networks, based on structural analysis of corresponding

predicting link decay. Our methods are independent of the underlying network
type, and can be applied to such diverse networks as the Web, social networks

and ice abundances in a protoplanetary disk, as function of time and position,
and the resulting chemical composition and cloud properties in the atmosphere
when young gas giant planets form. Large deviations between the abundances of
the host star and its gas giants seem likely to occur if the planet formation
follows the core-accretion scenario. These deviations stem from the separate
evolution of gas and dust in the disk, where the dust forms the planet cores,
followed by the final run-away accretion of the left-over gas. ProDiMo
protoplanetary disk models are used to predict the chemical evolution of gas
and ice in the midplane. We find that cosmic rays play a crucial role in slowly
un-blocking the CO, where the liberated oxygen forms water, which then freezes
out quickly. Therefore, the C/O ratio in the gas phase is found to gradually
increase with time, in a region bracketed by the water and CO ice-lines. In
this regions, C/O is found to approach unity after about 5 Myrs, scaling with
the cosmic ray ionisation rate. We then explore how the atmospheric chemistry
and cloud properties in young gas giants are affected when the non-solar C/O
ratios predicted by the disk models are assumed. The DRIFT cloud formation
model is applied to study the formation of atmospheric clouds under the
influence of varying primordial element abundances and its feedback onto the
local gas. We demonstrate that element depletion by cloud formation plays a
crucial role in converting an oxygen-rich atmosphere gas into carbon-rich gas
when non-solar, primordial element abundances are considered as suggested by
disk model.

attributed to non-equilibrium electro-osmosis related to the extended space

polarization at a charge-selective interface. This attribution had a double
basis. Firstly, it has been recognized that equilibrium electro-osmosis cannot
yield instability for a perfectly charge-selective solid. Secondly, it has been
shown that non-equilibrium electro-osmosis can. First theoretical studies in
which electro-osmotic instability was predicted and analyzed employed the
assumption of perfect charge-selectivity for the sake of simplicity and so did
the subsequent numerical studies of various time-dependent and nonlinear
features of electro-osmotic instability. In this letter, we show that relaxing
the assumption of perfect charge-selectivity (tantamount to fixing the

planets. FG planets were born together with the parent stars, while SG planets
form later from a SG proto-planetary disk formed by mass-loss from the evolved
primary star during its red giant branch (RGB) phase or asymptotic giant branch
(AGB) phase. We find that in some systems the SG scenario requires that more
than twenty percent of the SG proto-planetary disk mass ends in planets.
Although we cannot rule out SG planet formation in these systems, this fraction
of mass that ends in planets is much higher than the value commonly used in
planet formation theories. On the other hand, we find that for each of the
systems we can build a progenitor system composed of a main-sequence binary
system orbited by the appropriate planets. This can be done if the secondary
star was in a resonance with the inner planet. To account for the progenitor
properties we suggest that in cases where the secondary star has a mass of ~
0.1-0.2Msun, it was formed in the same way planets are formed, i.e., from a

fixed timesteps for solving fractional diffusion equations is usually very
large because the number of operations required to find the solution scales as
the square of the number of timesteps. Besides, the solutions of these problems
usually involve markedly different time scales, which leads to quite
inhomogeneous numerical errors. A natural way to address these difficulties is
by resorting to adaptive numerical methods where the size of the timesteps is
chosen according to the behaviour of the solution. A key feature of these
methods is then the efficiency of the adaptive algorithm employed to
dynamically set the size of every timestep. Here we discuss two adaptive
methods based on the step-doubling technique. These methods are, in many cases,
immensely faster than the corresponding standard method with fixed timesteps
and they allow a tolerance level to be set for the numerical errors that turns
out to be a good indicator of the actual errors.

a power law suggesting thermal Comptonization occuring in the system.
Cross-correlations between the simultaneous UV and X-ray light curves
(XMM-Newton) of five DNe in quiescence show time lags in the X-rays of 96-181
sec consistent with travel time of matter from a truncated inner disk to the
white dwarf surface. All this suggests that dwarf novae and other plausible
nonmagnetic systems have truncated accretion disks indicating that the disks
may be partially evaporated and the accretion may occur through hot (coronal)
flows in the disk.

time is linear assuming that the alphabet Sigma of the input string can be
identified with numbers from 1,ldots, N^c for some constant c. Algorithms with
such an approximation guarantee and running time are known, however all of them
were non-trivial and their analyses were involved. The here presented algorithm
computes the LZ77 factorisation and transforms it in phases to a grammar. In
each phase it maintains an LZ77-like factorisation of the word with at most l
factors as well as additional O(l) letters, where l was the size of the
original LZ77 factorisation. In one phase in a greedy way (by a left-to-right
sweep and a help of the factorisation) we choose a set of pairs of consecutive
letters to be replaced with new symbols, i.e. nonterminals of the constructed
grammar. We choose at least 2/3 of the letters in the word and there are O(l)
many different pairs among them. Hence there are O(log N) phases, each of them
introduces O(l) nonterminals to a grammar. A more precise analysis yields a
bound O(l log(N/l)). As l \leq g, this yields the desired bound O(g log(N/g)).

Constantin [Phys. Rev. B \textbf{75},155109 (2007)]), as well as two newly
designed Laplacian-level kinetic energy functionals (named L0.4 and L0.6).
First, a general assessment of the different functionals is performed, testing
them for model systems (one-electron densities, Hooke's atom and different
jellium systems), atomic and molecular kinetic energies as well as for their
behavior with respect to density-scaling transformations. Finally, we assess,
for the first time, the performance of the different functionals for Subsystem
Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations on non-covalently interacting
systems. We find that the different Laplacian-level meta-GGA kinetic
functionals may improve the description of different properties of electronic
systems but no clear overall advantage is found over the best GGA functionals.
Concerning Subsystem DFT calculations, the here proposed L0.4 kinetic energy
functional is competitive with state-of-the-art GGAs, whereas all other
Laplacian-level functionals fail badly. The performance of the Laplacian-level
functionals is rationalized thanks to a two-dimensional reduced-gradient and

economic network is in a state of (quasi)stationary equilibrium, i.e.
characterized by smooth structural changes rather than abrupt transitions.
While in the former case the behaviour of the system can be reasonably
controlled and predicted, in the latter case this is generally impossible.
Here, we propose a method to assess whether a real economic network is in a
quasi-stationary state by checking the consistency of its structural evolution
with appropriate quasi-equilibrium maximum-entropy ensembles of graphs. As
illustrative examples, we consider the International Trade Network (ITN) and
the Dutch Interbank Network (DIN). We find that the ITN is an almost perfect
example of quasi-equilibrium network, while the DIN is clearly
out-of-equilibrium. In the latter, the entity of the deviation from
quasi-stationarity contains precious information that allows us to identify
remarkable early warning signals of the interbank crisis of 2008. These early
warning signals involve certain dyadic and triadic topological properties,
including dangerous 'debt loops' with different levels of interbank
reciprocity.

with the phosphorus model we obtain results about existence and uniqueness of
their solutions. Actually, by assuming a generalized setting the theorems
establish the basis for the mathematical analysis of the whole model class to
which the investigated phosphorus model belongs.

states of neutrino distribution functions by our Boltzmann solver. Taking
advantage of the multi-angle and multi-energy feature realized by the S$_n$
method in our code, we reveal the genuine characteristics of spatially three
dimensional (3D) neutrino transfer such as non-radial fluxes and non-diagonal
Eddington tensors. In addition, we assess the ray-by-ray approximation, turning
off the lateral-transport terms in our code. We demonstrate that the ray-by-ray
approximation tends to propagate fluctuations in thermodynamical states around
the neutrino-sphere along each radial ray and overestimate the variations
between the neutrino distributions on different radial rays. We find that the
difference in the densities and fluxes of neutrinos between the ray-by-ray
approximation and the full Boltzmann transport becomes ~20%, which is also the
case for the local heating rate, whereas the volume-integrated heating rate in
the Boltzmann transport is found to be only slightly larger (~2%) than the
counterpart in the ray-by-ray approximation due to cancellation among different
rays. These results suggest that we had better assess carefully the possible
influences of various approximations in the neutrino transfer employed in the
current simulations on supernova dynamics. Detailed information on the angle

limited in obtaining high critical currents densities (JC) by the internal gas
pressure generated during the heat treatment, which expands the wire diameter

to increase the density of the superconducting filaments and therefore
decreasing the bubble density: much higher critical currents have been reached
always acting on the final as-drawn wires. We here try to pursue the same goal
of having a denser wire by acting on the deformation technique, through a
partial use of the groove-rolling at different wire processing stages. Such
technique has a larger powders compaction power, is straightforwardly adaptable
to long length samples, and allows the fabrication of samples with round,
square or rectangular shape depending on the application requirements. In this
paper we demonstrate the capability of this technique to increase the density

evaluate its performance by replaying traces of online social activities
collected from a mainstream OSN. Our results show that, with only mild resource

yet its nature is still unresolved. It could be made of neutral and massive
elementary particles which are their own antimatter partners. These dark matter
species undergo mutual annihilations whose effects are briefly reviewed in this
article. Dark matter annihilation plays a key role at early times as it sets
the relic abundance of the particles once they have decoupled from the
primordial plasma. A weak annihilation cross section naturally leads to a
cosmological abundance in agreement with observations. Dark matter species
subsequently annihilate - or decay - during Big Bang nucleosynthesis and could
play havoc with the light element abundances unless they offer a possible
solution to the $^{7}$Li problem. They could also reionize the intergalactic
medium after recombination and leave visible imprints in the cosmic microwave
background. But one of the most exciting aspects of the question lies in the
possibility to indirectly detect the dark matter species through the rare
antimatter particles - antiprotons, positrons and anti-deuterons - which they
produce as they currently annihilate inside the galactic halo. Finally, the
effects of dark matter annihilation on stars is discussed.

p_b, q_1, q_2 are the momenta of b-quark and two photons. We introduce a
nonzero mass m_s for the strange quark to regulate configurations where the
gluon or one of the photons become collinear with the strange quark and retain
terms which are logarithmic in m_s, while discarding terms which go to zero in
the limit m_s -> 0. When combining virtual- and bremsstrahlung corrections, the
infrared and collinear singularities induced by soft and/or collinear gluons
drop out. By our cuts the photons do not become soft, but one of them can
become collinear with the strange quark. This implies that in the final result
a single logarithms of m_s survives. In principle the configurations with
collinear photon emission could be treated using fragmentation functions. In a
related work we found that similar results can be obtained when simply
interpreting m_s appearing in the final result as a constituent mass. We do so
in the present paper and vary m_s between 400 MeV and 600 MeV in the numerics.

  measures","final version, to appear in Analysis and Geometry in Metric Spaces",,,,"math.DG math.MG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Let $\Omega$ be an open half-space or slab in $\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ endowed with
a perturbation of the Gaussian measure of the form
$f(p):=\exp(\omega(p)-c|p|^2)$, where $c>0$ and $\omega$ is a smooth concave
function depending only on the signed distance from the linear hyperplane
parallel to $\partial\Omega$. In this work we follow a variational approach to
show that half-spaces perpendicular to $\partial\Omega$ uniquely minimize the
weighted perimeter in $\Omega$ among sets enclosing the same weighted volume.
The main ingredient of the proof is the characterization of half-spaces
parallel or perpendicular to $\partial\Omega$ as the unique stable sets with
small singular set and null weighted capacity. Our methods also apply for
$\Omega=\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$, which produces in particular the classification of
stable sets in Gauss space and a new proof of the Gaussian isoperimetric
inequality. Finally, we use optimal transport to study the weighted minimizers
when the perturbation term $\omega$ is concave and possibly non-smooth.

modified in the presence of a gravitational field, so does the mass associated
to a bit of information. Some consequences ensuing these facts, as well as the

  Spectroscopy (HADRON 2013), Nara, Japan, November 4-8, 2013",,,,"hep-ph nucl-ex nucl-th","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We study baryon resonances with heavy flavor in a molecular approach, thus as
dynamically generated by meson-baryon scattering. This is accomplished by using
a unitary coupled-channel model taking, as bare interaction, the extension to
four flavors and spin symmetry of the Weinberg-Tomozawa interaction potential.
A special attention is paid to the inclusion of heavy-quark spin symmetry and
to the studies of the generated baryon resonances which complete the
heavy-quark spin multiplets. We reproduce few charmed and strange baryon
resonances found experimentally, that is, \Lambda_c(2595), \Lambda_c(2625),
\Xi_c(2790), \Xi_c(2815), and make predictions for more states. The
bottom-flavored \Lambda_b(5912) and \Lambda_b(5920) states, found by the LHCb
collaboration, are also obtained by our model, thus these resonances can be
interpreted as molecular states. We also study \Xi_b resonances, which belong
to the same SU(3) x HQSS multiplets as the observed \Lambda_b particles.
Finally we analyze hidden-charm baryon resonances. In this sector, we predict
seven N-like and five \Delta-like states with masses around 4 GeV, most of them
as bound states, and compare them with predictions from other models. The
predicted states can be searched for in future experiments that involve studies
of heavy-flavor physics, e.g. PANDA/FAIR, where charm physics will be analyzed.

regarding the onset of turbulence in shear flows. The absence of a clear cut
instability mechanism, the spatio-temporal intermittent character and extremely
long lived transients are some of the major difficulties encountered in these
flows and have hindered progress towards understanding the transition process.
We will show for the case of pipe flow that concepts from nonlinear dynamics
and statistical physics can help to explain the onset of turbulence. In
particular the turbulent structures ('puffs') observed close to onset are
spatially localized chaotic transients and their lifetimes increase super
exponentially with Reynolds number. At the same time fluctuations of individual
turbulent puffs can (although very rarely) lead to the nucleation of new puffs.
The competition between these two stochastic processes gives rise to a
non-equilibrium phase transition where turbulence changes from a
super-transient to a sustained state.

  Arrivals under Non-Ideal Circuit Power Consumption","30 pages, 7 figures",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper develops a novel approach to obtaining energy-efficient
transmission schedules for delay-limited bursty data arrivals under non-ideal
circuit power consumption. Assuming a-prior knowledge of packet arrivals,
deadlines and channel realizations, we show that the problem can be formulated
as a convex program. For both time-invariant and time-varying fading channels,
it is revealed that the optimal transmission between any two consecutive
channel or data state changing instants, termed epoch, can only take one of the
three strategies: (i) no transmission, (ii) transmission with an
energy-efficiency (EE) maximizing rate over part of the epoch, or (iii)
transmission with a rate greater than the EE-maximizing rate over the whole
epoch. Based on this specific structure, efficient algorithms are then
developed to find the optimal policies that minimize the total energy
consumption with a low computational complexity. The proposed approach can
provide the optimal benchmarks for practical schemes designed for transmissions
of delay-limited data arrivals, and can be employed to develop efficient online
scheduling schemes which require only causal knowledge of data arrivals and
deadline requirements.

a discrete group of isometries which contains two elements projecting to a pair
of independent rank one isometries in each factor. In [arXiv:1308.5584] we gave
a precise description of the structure of the geometric limit set of $\Gamma$;
our aim in this paper is to describe this set from a measure theoretical point
of view, using as a basic tool the properties of the exponent of growth of
$\Gamma$ established in the aforementioned article. We first show that the
conformal density obtained from the classical Patterson-Sullivan construction
is supported in a unique $\Gamma$-invariant subset of the geometric limit set;
generalizing this classical construction we then obtain measures supported in
each $\Gamma$-invariant subset of the regular limit set and investigate their
properties.
  We remark that apart from Kac-Moody groups over finite fields acting on the
Davis complex of their associated twin building, the probably most interesting
examples to which our results apply are isometry groups of reducible
CAT(0)-cube complexes without Euclidean factors.

developed on the basis of the electrodynamic effects of the Lorentz force

moving in Low Earth Orbit (LEO) in the geomagnetic field which is considered as
a dipole model. Our model of the torque due to the Lorentz force is developed
for a general shape of artificial satellite, and the nonlinear differential
equations of Euler are used to describe its attitude orientation. All
equilibrium positions are determined and {their} existence conditions are
obtained. The numerical results show that the charge $q$ and radius $\rho_0$ of
the charged center of satellite provide a certain type of semi passive control
for the attitude of satellite. The technique for such kind of control would be
to increase or decrease the electrostatic radiation screening of the satellite.
The results {obtained} confirm that the change in charge can effect the
magnitude of the Lorentz torque, which may affect the satellite's control.
Moreover, the relation between the magnitude of the Lorentz torque and
inclination of the orbits is investigated.
