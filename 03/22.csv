in time (FIT) and backward in time (BIT) dispersion of fluid and inertial
particle pairs in isotropic turbulence. Fluid particles are known to separate
faster BIT than FIT in three-dimensional turbulence, and we find that inertial
particles do the same. However, we find that the irreversibility in the
inertial particle dispersion is in general much stronger than that for fluid
particles. For example, the ratio of the BIT to FIT mean-square separation can
be up to an order of magnitude larger for inertial particles than for the fluid
particles. We also find that for both the inertial and fluid particles the
irreversibility becomes stronger as the scale of their separation decreases.
Regarding the physical mechanism for the irreversibility, we argue that whereas
the irreversibility of fluid particle-pair dispersion can be understood in
terms of a directional bias arising from the energy transfer process in
turbulence, inertial particles experience an additional source of
irreversibility arising from the non-local contribution to their velocity
dynamics, a contribution which vanishes in the limit ${St\to0}$, where $St$ is
the particle Stokes number. For each given initial (final, in the backward in
time case) separation $\bm{r}^0$ there is an optimum value of $St$ for which
the dispersion irreversibility is strongest, as such particles are optimally
affected by both sources of irreversibility. We derive analytical expressions
for the BIT, mean-square separation of inertial particles and compare the
predictions with...

afterglow emission from the external forward shock and presents examples of
some of its applications. One interesting research topic discussed in the paper
is the high-energy radiation produced by Compton scattering of the prompt GRB
photons against the shock-accelerated electrons. The difference between the
forward shock emission in a wind-type and a constant-density medium is also
studied, and the emission due to Maxwellian electron injection is compared to
the case with pure power-law electrons. The code calculates the time-evolving
photon and electron distributions in the emission region by solving the
relativistic kinetic equations for each particle species. For the first time,
the full relativistic equations for synchrotron emission/absorption, Compton
scattering, and pair production/annihilation were applied to model the forward
shock emission. The synchrotron self-absorption thermalization mechanism, which
shapes the low-energy end of the electron distribution, was also included in
the electron equation. The simulation results indicate that inverse Compton
scattering of the prompt GRB photons can produce a luminous TeV emission
component, even when pair production in the emission region is taken into
account. This very high-energy radiation may be observable in low-redshift
GRBs. The test simulations also show that the low-energy end of a pure
power-law distribution of electrons can thermalize owing to synchrotron
self-absorption in a wind-type environment, but without an observable impact on
the radiation spectrum. Moreover, a flattening in the forward shock X-ray light
curve may be expected when the electron injection function is assumed to be
purely Maxwellian instead of a power law.

decoration, give vortex lattice images in a variety of systems. However, strong
type II superconductors allow penetration of the magnetic field over large
distances, of order of the magnetic penetration depth \lambda.
Superconductivity survives up to magnetic fields where, for imaging purposes,
there is nearly no magnetic contrast. Static and dynamic properties of vortices
are largely unknown at such high magnetic fields. Reciprocal space studies
using neutron scattering give insight into the collective behavior. But the
microscopic details of vortex arrangements and their motion remain difficult to
obtain. Direct real space visualization can be made using scanning tunneling
microscopy and spectroscopy (STM/S). Instead of using magnetic contrast, the
electronic density of states describes spatial variations of the quasiparticle
and pair wavefunction properties. These are of order of the superconducting
coherence length \xi, which is much smaller than \lambda. In principle,
individual vortices can be imaged using STM up to the upper critical field
where vortex cores, of size \xi, overlap. In this review, we describe recent
advances in vortex imaging made with scanning tunneling microscopy and

the influence of the Fermi surface distribution of the superconducting gap on
the internal structure of vortices, the collective behavior of the lattice in

  Decision and Control (2014)",,"10.1109/CDC.2014.7039820",,"cs.SY math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, we introduce a significant extension, called scenario with
certificates (SwC), of the so-called scenario approach for uncertain
optimization problems. This extension is motivated by the observation that in
many control problems only some of the optimization variables are used in the
design phase, while the other variables play the role of certificates. Examples
are all those control problems that can be reformulated in terms of linear
matrix inequalities involving parameter-dependent Lyapunov functions. These
control problems include static anti-windup compensator design for uncertain
linear systems with input saturation, where the goal is the minimization of the
nonlinear gain from an exogenous input to a performance output. The main
contribution of this paper is to show that randomization is a useful tool,
specifically for anti-windup design, to make the overall approach less
conservative compared to its robust counterpart. In particular, we demonstrate
that the scenario with certificates reformulation is appealing because it
provides a way to implicitly design the parameter-dependent Lyapunov functions.
Finally, to further reduce the computational cost of this one-shot approach, we
present a sequential randomized algorithm for iteratively solving this problem.

how the evolution of a system described by quantum electrodynamics in Coulomb
gauge is uniquely determined by its initial state and two reduced quantities.
These two fundamental observables, the polarization of the Dirac field and the
vector potential of the photon field, can be calculated by solving two coupled,
non-linear evolution equations without the need to explicitly determine the
(numerically infeasible) many-body wave function of the coupled quantum system.
To find reliable approximations to the implicit functionals we present the
according Kohn-Sham construction. In the non-relativistic limit this
density-functional-type theory of quantum electrodynamics reduces to the
density-functional reformulation of the Pauli-Fierz Hamiltonian, which is based
on the current density of the electrons and the vector potential of the photon
field. By making further approximations, e.g. restricting the allowed modes of
the photon field, we derive further density functional-type theories of coupled
matter-photon systems for the corresponding approximate Hamiltonians. In the
limit of only two sites and one mode we deduce the according effective theory
for the two-site Hubbard model coupled to one photonic mode. This model system
is used to illustrate the basic ideas of a density-functional reformulation in

reach an optimal result. One of the novelty of this work resides in the
proposed method for the addition of vertices. We use a determinantal point

with other vertices addition methods, and the whole disaster recovery algorithm
to the greedy algorithm for the set cover problem.

density and temperatures for several HII regions in M81. Gradient analysis is
based on oxygen abundances.Together with a set of HII region abundances
determined similarly by us with Multi-Mirror Telescope (MMT) spectra, the new
data yield to a radial oxygen gradient of -0.088$\pm$0.013 dex kpc$^{-1}$,
which is steeper than the metallicity gradient obtained for planetary nebulae
(-0.044$\pm$0.007 dex kpc$^{-1}$). This result could be interpreted as gradient
evolution with time: Models of galactic evolution with inside-out disk
formation associated to pre-enriched gas infall would produce such difference
of gradients, although stellar migration effects would also induce a difference
in the metallicity gradients between the old and young populations. By
comparing the M81 metallicity gradients with those of other spiral galaxies,
all consistently derived from weak-line analysis, we can infer that similar
gradient difference is common among spirals. The metallicity gradient slopes
for HII regions and PNe seem to be steeper in M81 than in other galactic disks,
which is likely due to the fact that M81 belongs to a galaxy group. We also
found that M81 has experienced an average oxygen enrichment of 0.14$\pm$0.08
dex in the spatial domain defined by the observations. Our data are compatible
with a break in the radial oxygen gradient slope around R$_{25}$ as inferred by

detecting baryonic acoustic oscillations (BAO). Though AGN selection in X-ray
band is very clean and efficient, it does not provide redshift information, and
thus needs to be complemented with an optical follow-up. The main focus of this
study is (i) to find the requirements needed for the quality of the optical
follow-up and (ii) to formulate the optimal strategy of the X-ray survey, in
order to detect the BAO. We demonstrate that redshift accuracy of
$\sigma_0=10^{-2}$ at $z=1$ and the catastrophic failure rate of $f_{\rm
fail}\lesssim 30\%$ are sufficient for a reliable detection of BAO in future
X-ray surveys. Spectroscopic quality redshifts ($\sigma_0=10^{-3}$ and $f_{\rm
fail}\sim 0$) will boost the confidence level of the BAO detection by a factor
of $\sim 2$. For meaningful detection of BAO, X-ray surveys of moderate depth
of $F_{\rm lim}\sim {\rm few~} 10^{-15}$ erg/s/cm$^2$ covering sky area from a
few hundred to $\sim$ten thousand square degrees are required. The optimal
strategy for the BAO detection does not necessarily require full sky coverage.
For example, in a 1000-day long survey by an eROSITA type telescope, an optimal
strategy would be to survey a sky area of $\sim 9000$ deg$^2$, yielding a $\sim
16\sigma$ BAO detection. A similar detection will be achieved by ATHENA+ or
WFXT class telescopes in a survey with a duration of 100 days, covering a
similar sky area. XMM-Newton can achieve a marginal BAO detection in a 100-day
survey covering $\sim 400$ deg$^2$. These surveys would demand a
moderate-to-high cost in terms the optical follow-ups, requiring determination
of redshifts of $\sim 10^5$ (XMM-Newton) to $\sim 3\times 10^6$ objects

no systematic trends with spectral type, metallicity, or the method used to

long-slit spectroscopic observations of a sample of 21 S0s from the Virgo
Cluster to produce one-dimensional spectra representing purely the bulge and
disc light for each galaxy. Analysis of the Lick indices within these spectra
reveals that the bulges contain consistently younger and more metal-rich
stellar populations than their surrounding discs, implying that the final
episode of star formation within S0s occurs in their central regions. Analysis
of the $\alpha$-element abundances in these components further presents a
picture in which the final episode of star formation in the bulge is fueled
using gas that has previously been chemically enriched in the disc, indicating
the sequence of events in the transformation of these galaxies. Systems in
which star formation in the disk was spread over a longer period contain bulges
in which the final episode of star formation occurred more recently, as one
might expect for an approximately coeval population in which the transformation
from spiral to S0 occurred at different times. With data of this quality and
the new analysis method deployed here, we can begin to describe this process in

modulation with respect to $\varphi_R$ is new. Finally, we employ a modified
version of the $\tt{LEPTO}$ Monte Carlo event generator that includes the
Sivers effect to estimate the size of single spin asymmetries corresponding to
these modulations. We show that $\sin(\varphi_R-\varphi_S)$ modulations can be
significant, especially if we impose asymmetric cuts on the momenta of the

galaxies identified in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) depends on whether
the host galaxy is in a filament or not. Isolated primary galaxies are
identified in the SDSS spectroscopic sample while potential satellites (that
are up to 4 magnitudes fainter than their hosts) are searched for in the much
deeper photometric sample. Filaments are constructed from the galaxy
distribution by the ""Bisous"" process. Isolated primary galaxies are divided
into two subsamples: those in filaments and those not in filaments. We examine
the stacked mean satellite LF of both the filament and non-filament sample and
find that, on average, the satellite LFs of galaxies in filaments is
significantly higher than those of galaxies not in filaments. The filamentary
environment can increases the abundance of the brightest satellites
($M_\mathrm{sat.} < M_\mathrm{prim.} + 2.0$), by a factor of $\sim 2$ compared
with non-filament isolated galaxies. This result is independent of primary
galaxy magnitude although the satellite LF of galaxies in the faintest
magnitude bin, is too noisy to determine if such a dependence exists. Since our
filaments are extracted from a spectroscopic flux-limited sample, we consider
the possibility that the difference in satellite LF is due to a redshift,
colour or environmental bias, finding these to be insufficient to explain our
result. The dependence of the satellite LF on the cosmic web suggests that the
filamentary environment may have a strong effect on the efficiency of galaxy
formation.

demands solving the full Vlasov hierarchy for the moments of the phase space
distribution function. In the presence of long-range interaction no consistent
truncation of the hierarchy is known apart from the pressure- less fluid (dust)
model which is incapable of describing virialization due to the occurrence of
shell-crossing singularities and the inability to generate vorticity and higher
cumulants like velocity dispersion. Our goal is to find a simple ansatz for the
phase space distribution function that approximates the full Vlasov
distribution function without pathologies in a controlled way and therefore can
serve as theoretical N-body double and as a replacement for the dust model. We
argue that the coarse-grained Wigner probability distribution obtained from a
wave function fulfilling the Schr\""odinger-Poisson equation (SPE) is the
sought-after function. We show that its evolution equation approximates the
Vlasov equation and therefore also the dust equations before shell-crossing,
but cures the shell-crossing singularities and is able to describe regions of
multi-streaming and virialization. This feature was already employed in
simulations by Widrow & Kaiser (1993). The coarse-grained Wigner ansatz allows
to calculate all higher moments from density and velocity analytically, thereby
incorporating nonzero higher cumulants in a self-consistent manner. On this
basis we are able to show that the Schr\""odinger method (ScM) automatically
closes the corresponding hierarchy such that it suffices to solve the SPE in

important two-dimensional semiconductor with promising potentials for

semiconductor, exhibiting a number of intriguing optical phenomena such as
valley selective circular dichroism, doping dependent charged excitons, and
strong photocurrent responses. However, the fundamental mechanism underlying
such a strong light-matter interaction is still under intensive investigation.
The observed optical resonance was initially considered to be band-to-band
transitions. In contrast, first-principle calculations predicted a much larger
quasiparticle band gap size and an optical response that is dominated by
excitonic effects. Here, we report experimental evidence of the exciton
dominance mechanism by discovering a series of excitonic dark states in
single-layer WS2 using two-photon excitation spectroscopy. In combination with
GW-BSE theory, we find the excitons are Wannier excitons in nature but possess
extraordinarily large binding energy (~0.7 eV), leading to a quasiparticle band
gap of 2.7 eV. These strongly bound exciton states are observed stable even at
room temperature. We reveal an exciton series in significant deviation from
hydrogen models, with a novel inverse energy dependence on the orbital angular
momentum. These excitonic energy levels are experimentally found robust against
environmental perturbations. The discovery of excitonic dark states and
exceptionally large binding energy not only sheds light on the importance of
many-electron effects in this two-dimensional gapped system, but also holds
exciting potentials for the device application of TMDC monolayers and their
heterostructures.

thought that Rop increases the bend angle of the R1inv-R2inv complex upon

increase in FRET upon the addition of Rop that is shown via modeling to be
consistent with a decrease in the bend angle of the complex of
$-15^{\circ}\pm7^{\circ}$. The model predicts FRET from dye trajectories
generated using molecular dynamics simulations of Cy3 and Cy5 attached to $5'$
terminal cytosine or guanosine on RNA. While FRET is commonly used to observe
global changes in molecular structure attributed to changes in the distance
between dyes, it is rarely, if ever, used to elucidate angular changes. Subtle
global changes in molecular structure upon binding are generally difficult to
discern using NMR or crystallography, but FRET is well suited to observe these
changes because of its sensitivity at interdye distance around the F\""orster
radius, $R_F\approx5$ nm. While FRET is often referred to and used as a
""molecular ruler"" for distances around $R_F$, for dye pairs that have minimal
rotational freedom, FRET can also be used to observe changes in structure for
which there is no significant change in distance between the dyes. This is the
case for the R1inv-R2inv kissing complex studied here. This complex is derived
from the RNA I - RNA II complex in E. coli. RNA II is a primer for replication
of the ColE1 plasmid, its function is modulated by interaction with RNA II. Rop
is known to stabilize the complex, and it is also known to bind kissing
complexes in a structure, but not sequence, dependent fashion.

(LSP) can be stable over cosmologically time-scales and still account for the
dark matter relic density. We examine the possibility of generating detectable
X-ray lines from R-parity violating decays of keV-scale LSP dark matter to
neutrino-photon pairs. Specifically, we consider scenarios in which the LSP is
a light gravitino, bino, or hidden sector photino. Potential signals are
discussed in the context of recent claims of an unidentified 3.5 keV X-ray line
in studies of stacked galaxy clusters. We comment on the difficulties in
obtaining the observed relic density for keV scale bino or hidden photino dark

neglect storm size. These models may be inadequate in accurately predicting the
losses of super-sized storms, such as Hurricane Sandy in 2012. In this study,
we examined the dependencies of normalized U.S. hurricane loss on both wind
speed and storm size for 73 tropical cyclones that made landfall in the U.S.
from 1988 to 2012. A multi-variate least squares regression is used to
construct a hurricane loss model using both wind speed and size as predictors.
Using maximum wind speed and size together captures more variance of losses
than using wind speed or size alone. It is found that normalized hurricane loss
(L) approximately follows a power law relation with maximum wind speed (Vmax)
and size (R). Assuming L=10^c Vmax^a R^b, c being a scaling factor, the
coefficients, a and b, generally range between 4-12 and 2-4, respectively. Both
a and b tend to increase with stronger wind speed. For large losses, a weighted
regression model, with a being 4.28 and b being 2.52, produces a reasonable
fitting to the actual losses. Hurricane Sandy's size was about 3.4 times of the
average size of the 73 storms analyzed. Based on the weighted regression model,
Hurricane Sandy's loss would be 21 times smaller if its size were of the
average size with maximum wind speed unchanged. It is important to revise
conventional empirical hurricane loss models to include both maximum wind speed
and size as predictors.

in a two-terminal quantum conductor whose temperature is probed by a third

cumulant-generating function obeys the fluctuation theorem in the presence of a
constant magnetic field. The analysis is based on the scattering matrix of the
three-terminal junction (comprising of the two electronic terminals and the
probe electrode), and a separation of time scales: it is assumed that the rapid
charge transfer across the conductor and the rapid relaxation of the electrons
inside the probe electrode give rise to much slower energy fluctuations in the
latter. This separation allows for a stochastic treatment of the probe
dynamics, and the reduction of the three-terminal setup to an effective
two-terminal one. Expressions for the lowest nonlinear transport coefficients,
e.g., the linear-response heat-current noise and the second nonlinear thermal
conductance, are obtained and explicitly shown to preserve the symmetry of the
fluctuation theorem for the two-terminal conductor. The derivation of our
expressions which is based on the transport coefficients of the three-terminal

monotone over a compact convex set. We present two robust variants of
stochastic extragradient algorithms for solving such problems. Of these, the
first scheme employs an iterative averaging technique where we consider a
generalized choice for the weights in the averaged sequence. Our first
contribution is to show that using an appropriate choice for these weights, a
suitably defined gap function attains the optimal rate of convergence ${\cal
O}\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{k}}\right)$. In the second part of the paper, under an
additional assumption of weak-sharpness, we update the stepsize sequence using
a recursive rule that leverages problem parameters. The second contribution
lies in showing that employing such a sequence, the extragradient algorithm
possesses almost-sure convergence to the solution as well as convergence in a
mean-squared sense to the solution of the problem at the rate ${\cal
O}\left(\frac{1}{k}\right)$. Motivated by the absence of a Lipschitzian
parameter, in both schemes we utilize a locally randomized smoothing scheme.
Importantly, by approximating a smooth mapping, this scheme enables us to
estimate the Lipschitzian parameter. The smoothing parameter is updated per
iteration and we show convergence to the solution of the original problem in
both algorithms.

demographic history, including a recent epoch of rapid population growth that
led to an excess in the proportion of rare genetic variants in humans today.
This excess can impact the burden of private mutations for each individual,
defined here as the proportion of heterozygous variants in each newly sequenced
individual that are novel compared to another large sample of sequenced
individuals. We calculated the burden of private mutations predicted by
different demographic models, and compared with empirical estimates based on
data from the NHLBI Exome Sequencing Project and data from the Neutral Regions
(NR) dataset. We observed a significant excess in the proportion of private
mutations in the empirical data compared with models of demographic history
without a recent epoch of population growth. Incorporating recent growth into
the model provides a much improved fit to empirical observations. This
phenomenon becomes more marked for larger sample sizes. The proportion of
private mutations is additionally increased by purifying selection, which
differentially affect mutations of different functional annotations. These
results have important implications to the design and analysis of

  Study","Accepted with no Changes for Wiley Expert Systems",,,,"cs.AI cs.CY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Little knowledge exists on the impact and results associated with
e-government projects in many specific use domains. Therefore it is necessary
to evaluate the efficiency and effectiveness of e-government systems. Since the
development of e-government is a continuous process of improvement, it requires
continuous evaluation of the overall e-government system as well as evaluation
of its various dimensions such as determinants, characteristics and results.
E-government development is often complex with multiple stakeholders, large
user bases and complex goals. Consequently, even experts have difficulties in
evaluating these systems, especially in an integrated and comprehensive way as
well as on an aggregate level. Expert systems are a candidate solution to
evaluate such complex e-government systems. However, it is difficult for expert
systems to cope with uncertain evaluation data that are vague, inconsistent,
highly subjective or in other ways challenging to formalize. This paper
presents an approach that can handle uncertainty in e-government evaluation:
The combination of Belief Rule Base (BRB) knowledge representation and
Evidential Reasoning (ES). This approach is illustrated with a concrete
prototype, known as Belief Rule Based Expert System (BRBES) and put to use in
the local e-government of Bangladesh. The results have been compared with a
recently developed method of evaluating e-Government, and it is shown that the
results of BRBES are more accurate and reliable. BRBES can be used to identify
the factors that need to be improved to achieve the overall aim of an
e-government project. In addition, various ""what if"" scenarios can be generated
and developers and managers can get a forecast of the outcomes. In this way,
the system can be used to facilitate decision making processes under
uncertainty.

achieved by tuning the frequency of the input laser field (driving field).

the quasiparticle excitations, a gapless superfluid state can be formed over a
certain range of superflow velocity above the pair-breaking onset. In addition
to the usual quasiparticle-pair continuum and the Anderson-Bogoliubov

has a quasiparticle-quasihole continuum and a second collective mode. We find
that the long-wavelength excitations of the second collective mode eventually

continuously from the second Lagrangian point (L2) between August 2009 and
January 2012. It operates with 52 high impedance bolometers cooled at 100mK in
a range of frequency between 100 GHz and 1THz with unprecedented sensivity, but
strong coupling with cosmic radiation. At L2, the particle flux is about 5
$cm^{-2} s^{-1}$ and is dominated by protons incident on the spacecraft.
Protons with an energy above 40MeV can penetrate the focal plane unit box
causing two different effects: glitches in the raw data from direct interaction
of cosmic rays with detectors (producing a data loss of about 15% at the end of
the mission) and thermal drifts in the bolometer plate at 100mK adding
non-gaussian noise at frequencies below 0.1Hz. The HFI consortium has made
strong efforts in order to correct for this effect on the time ordered data and
final Planck maps. This work intends to give a view of the physical explanation
of the glitches observed in the HFI instrument in-flight. To reach this goal,
we performed several ground-based experiments using protons and $\alpha$
particles to test the impact of particles on the HFI spare bolometers with a
better control of the environmental conditions with respect to the in-flight
data. We have shown that the dominant part of glitches observed in the data
comes from the impact of cosmic rays in the silicon die frame supporting the
micro-machinced bolometric detectors propagating energy mainly by ballistic
phonons and by thermal diffusion. The implications of these results for future
satellite missions will be discussed.

observation consisted of a time series in sit-and-stare mode of 36 minutes of

the time evolution of individual vertical threads. Eventually, we observed the
development of a dark Rayleigh-Taylor plume that propagated upward with a
velocity, projected onto the plane of the sky, of 17 km/s. Interestingly, the
plume apex collided with the prominence threads pushing them aside. We inferred
Doppler shifts, Doppler widths, and magnetic field strength variations by
interpreting the He I Stokes profiles with the HAZEL code. The Doppler shifts
show that clusters of threads move coherently while individual threads have
oscillatory patterns. Regarding the plume we found strong redshifts (9-12 km/s)
and large Doppler widths (10 km/s) at the plume apex when it passed through the
prominence body and before it disintegrated. We associate the redshifts with
perspective effects while the Doppler widths are more likely due to an increase
in the local temperature. No local variations of the magnetic field strength
associated with the passage of the plume were found; this leads us to conclude
that the plumes are no more magnetized than the surroundings. Finally, we found
that some of the threads oscillations are locally damped, what allowed us to
apply prominence seismology techniques to infer additional prominence physical
parameters.

complete isolation in a branch of the database; when conflicts occur, we detect

This frees users from the complications and performance hazards of locks, and

spectrum efficiency in cognitive radio networks. The key idea is that the
secondary system helps to boost the primary system's performance by relaying
and in return the primary system provides more opportunities for the secondary
system to access the spectrum. In contrast to most of existing works that only
consider information cooperation, this paper studies joint information and
energy cooperation between the two systems, i.e., the primary transmitter sends
information for relaying and feeds the secondary system with energy as well.
This is particularly useful when the secondary transmitter has good channel
quality to the primary receiver but is energy constrained. We propose and study
three schemes that enable this cooperation. Firstly, we assume there exists an
ideal backhaul between the two systems for information and energy transfer. We
then consider two wireless information and energy transfer schemes from the
primary transmitter to the secondary transmitter using power splitting and time
splitting energy harvesting techniques, respectively. For each scheme, the
optimal and zero-forcing solutions are derived. Simulation results demonstrate
promising performance gain for both systems due to the additional energy
cooperation. It is also revealed that the power splitting scheme can achieve
larger rate region than the time splitting scheme when the efficiency of the
energy transfer is sufficiently large.

additional matter fluctuations induced by magnetic fields. We analyse both
these effects and show that the latter is potentially observable because the
number of haloes along of line of sight can increase by many orders of
magnitude. While this effect is not strongly dependent on the magnetic field
strength in the range $0.3\hbox{--}0.6$ nG, it is extremely sensitive to the
magnetic field power spectral index for the near scale-free models. Therefore
the detection of such absorption features could be a sensitive probe of the
primordial magnetic field and its power spectrum. We discuss the detectability

The dynamics is
analyzed using a geometric decomposition based upon multiple time scales. The
Olsen model is four-dimensional, not in a standard form required by geometric
singular perturbation theory and contains multiple small parameters. These
three obstacles are the main challenges we resolve by our analysis. Scaling and
the blow-up method are used to identify several subsystems. The results
presented here provide a rigorous analysis for two oscillatory modes. In
particular, we prove the existence of non-classical relaxation oscillations in
two cases. The analysis is based upon desingularization of lines of
transcritical and submanifolds of fold singularities in combination with an
integrable relaxation phase. In this context our analysis also explains an
assumption that has been utilized, based purely on numerical reasoning, in a
previous bifurcation analysis by Desroches, Krauskopf and Osinga

mixed-mode and chaotic oscillations in the Olsen model, which will be discussed
in more detail in future work.

adding an arbitrary 1-form to the Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) line
element, a privileged axis in the universe is picked out. The distance-redshift
relation is modified to be direction-dependent. We wish that the anisotropic
cosmological model may be tested crossly by independent observations. Type-Ia
supernovae (SNe Ia) calibrated from four different light curve fitters are used
to constrain possible anisotropy of the universe. The magnitudes of anisotropy
are all between 2% --- 5%, but the systematic uncertainty cannot be excluded.
The directions of privileged axis seem to differ from each other. The
statistical significance is not high enough to make a convincing conclusion.
Nevertheless, the $1\sigma$ contours in the $(l,b)$ plane obtained from four
groups of SNe Ia have an overlap, centering at $(l,b)\approx
(170^{\circ},0^{\circ})$. Monte Carlo simulation shows that the anisotropy is
unlikely to be caused by selection effect.

imminent detection of gravitational waves from merging neutron star binaries

numerical-relativity simulations of binaries with nuclear equations of state,
we find that the postmerger emission is characterized by two distinct and

associated with the oscillations of the hypermassive neutron star produced by
the merger and depends on the equation of state, a new correlation emerges
between the low-frequency peak, related to the merger process, and the total
compactness of the stars in the binary. More importantly, such a correlation is
essentially universal, thus providing a powerful tool to set tight constraints
on the equation of state. If the mass of the binary is known from the inspiral
signal, the combined use of the two frequency peaks sets four simultaneous
constraints to be satisfied. Ideally, even a single detection would be
sufficient to select one equation of state over the others. We test our
approach with simulated data and verify it works well for all the equations of
state considered.

down-conversion (PDC), focusing on the spatio-temporal spectral properties of
the sum-frequency generated (SFG) radiation. We demonstrate that the incoherent
component of the SFG spectrum is characterized by a skewed geometry in
space-time, which originates from a compensation between the group-velocity
mismatch and the spatial walk-off of the fundamental and the SFG fields. The
results are illustrated both by a theoretical modeling of the optical system
and by experimental measurements.

"1403.7421","Paolo Simonetto","Bahador Saket, Paolo Simonetto and Stephen Kobourov","Group-Level Graph Visualization Taxonomy",,,,,"cs.HC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Task taxonomies for graph and network visualizations focus on tasks commonly
encountered when analyzing graph connectivity and topology. However, in many
application fields such as the social sciences (social networks), biology
(protein interaction models), software engineering (program call graphs),
connectivity and topology information is intertwined with group, clustering,
and hierarchical information. Several recent visualization techniques, such as
BubbleSets, LineSets and GMap, make explicit use of grouping and clustering,
but evaluating such visualization has been difficult due to the lack of
standardized group-level tasks. With this in mind, our goal is to define a new
set of tasks that assess group-level comprehension. We propose several types of
group-level tasks and provide several examples of each type. Finally, we
characterize some of the proposed tasks using the multi-level typology of
abstract visualization tasks. We believe that adding group-level tasks to the
task taxonomy for graph visualization would make the taxonomy more useful for
the recent graph visualization techniques. It would help evaluators define and
categorize new tasks, and it would help generalize individual results collected
in controlled experiments.

to the nonlinear Born-Infeld electrodynamics is presented. The strategy for
obtaining these solutions is to start from Myers-Perry solutions, and then
considering the effects of the dilaton field, Born-Infeld parameter as well as
the electric charge as a perturbative parameter. We perform the perturbations
up to 4th order in the extremal black holes of Einstein-Born-Infeld-dilaton
gravity with equal angular momentum and arbitrary dilaton coupling constant. We
discuss the physical properties of these black holes and study their dependence
on the perturbative parameter $q$, the dilaton coupling constant $\alpha$ and
the Born-Infeld parameter $\beta$. One can see these black holes solutions
satisfy a generalized Smarr relation.

Bayesian nonparametric mixed membership model. The HDSP generalizes the
hierarchical Dirichlet process (HDP) to model the correlation structure between
metadata in the corpus and mixture components. We construct the HDSP based on
the normalized gamma representation of the Dirichlet process, and this
construction allows incorporating a scaling function that controls the
membership probabilities of the mixture components. We develop two scaling
methods to demonstrate that different modeling assumptions can be expressed in
the HDSP. We also derive the corresponding approximate posterior inference
algorithms using variational Bayes. Through experiments on datasets of
newswire, medical journal articles, conference proceedings, and product
reviews, we show that the HDSP results in a better predictive performance than
labeled LDA, partially labeled LDA, and author topic model and a better
negative review classification performance than the supervised topic model and
SVM.
