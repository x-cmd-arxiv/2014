system of $N$ sensors, which receive continuous sequential observations from
the environment. It is assumed that the signals, which are modeled by general
It\^{o} processes, are coupled across sensors, but that their onset times may
differ from sensor to sensor. Two main cases are considered; in the first one
signal strengths are the same across sensors while in the second one they
differ by a constant. The objective is the optimal detection of the first time
at which any sensor in the system receives a signal. The problem is formulated
as a stochastic optimization problem in which an extended minimal
Kullback-Leibler divergence criterion is used as a measure of detection delay,
with a constraint on the mean time to the first false alarm. The case in which
the sensors employ cumulative sum (CUSUM) strategies is considered, and it is
proved that the minimum of $N$ CUSUMs is asymptotically optimal as the mean
time to the first false alarm increases without bound. In particular, in the
case of equal signal strengths across sensors, it is seen that the difference
in detection delay of the $N$-CUSUM stopping rule and the unknown optimal
stopping scheme tends to a constant related to the number of sensors as the
mean time to the first false alarm increases without bound. Alternatively, in
the case of unequal signal strengths, it is seen that this difference tends to
zero.

Accepted for publication in MNRAS",,"10.1093/mnras/stu431",,"astro-ph.GA astro-ph.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  It is usually assumed that outflows from luminous AGN are either in the
energy-conserving (non-radiative) or in the momentum-conserving (radiative)
regime. We show that in a non-spherical geometry the effects of both regimes
may manifest at the same time, and that it is the momentum of the outflow that
sets the $M_{\rm BH}-\sigma$ relation. Considering an initially elliptical
distribution of gas in the host galaxy, we show that a non-radiative outflow
opens up a wide ``escape route'' over the paths of least resistance. Most of
the outflow energy escapes in that direction. At the same time, in the
directions of higher resistance, the ambient gas is affected mainly by the
incident momentum from the outflow. Quenching SMBH growth requires quenching
gas delivery along the paths of highest resistance, and therefore, it is the
momentum of the outflow that limits the black hole growth. We present an
analytical argument showing that such energy-conserving feedback bubbles
driving leaky ambient shells will terminate SMBH growth once its mass reaches
roughly the $M_\sigma$ mass derived earlier by King (2003) for
momentum-conserving AGN outflows. Our simulations also have potentially
important implications for observations of AGN jet feedback and starburst
galaxy feedback. The collimation of the wide angle AGN outflow away from the
symmetry plane, as found in our simulations, indicates that credit for work
done by such outflows may sometimes be mistakenly given to AGN jets or star
formation feedback since wide angle $v \sim 0.1 c$ outflows are harder to
observe and the phase when they are present may be short.

the orientation of the wire, and that the nature of this anisotropy depends
strongly on the electron density and the relative strengths of the Rashba and
Dresselhaus spin-orbit coupling. In particular, at low densities when only one
subband of the quantum wire is occupied, the spin Hall effect is strongest for
electron momentum along the $[\bar{1}10]$ axis, which is opposite than what is
expected for the purely 2D case. In addition, when more than one subband is
occupied, the strength and anisotropy of the spin Hall effect can vary greatly
over relatively small changes in electron density, which makes it difficult to
predict which wire orientation will maximize the strength of the spin Hall
effect. These results help to illuminate the role of quantum confinement in
spin-orbit-coupled systems, and can serve as a guide for future experimental
work on the use of quantum wires for spin-Hall-based spintronic applications.

considering the dispersion relation of the electrons in the wire, which is
characterized by the anticrossing of adjacent subbands. These results lead to a
simple estimate of the optimal wire width for spin Hall transport experiments,

The anticrossing of adjacent subbands is related to a quantum phase transition

operator of multiplication by a function (distribution) $\sigma(\lambda)$,
$\lambda\in {\Bbb R}$. We find a scale of spaces of test functions where ${\sf

corresponding spaces of distributions. We show that $h= {\sf L}^* \sigma$ which
yields a one-to-one correspondence between kernels $h(t)$ and sigma-functions
$\sigma(\lambda)$ of Hankel operators. The sigma-function of a self-adjoint
Hankel operator $H$ contains substantial information about its spectral
properties. Thus we show that the operators $H$ and $\Sigma$ have the same
numbers of positive and negatives eigenvalues. In particular, we find necessary
and sufficient conditions for sign-definiteness of Hankel operators. These
results are illustrated at examples of quasi-Carleman operators generalizing
the classical Carleman operator with kernel $h(t)=t^{-1}$ in various
directions. The concept of the sigma-function directly leads to a criterion
(equivalent of course to the classical Nehari theorem) for boundedness of
Hankel operators. Our construction also shows that every Hankel operator is
unitarily equivalent by the Mellin transform to a pseudo-differential operator
with amplitude which is a product of functions of one variable only (of
$x\in{\Bbb R}$ and of its dual variable).

top layer and large Schottky barriers for current injection in the deeper
layers. As a consequence, the majority of the current flows through the top
layer of the array. Our simulations show that doping of the CNT array can
alleviate this problem, even without direct contact to each tube in the array;
however, we find that the charge transfer length is unusually long in arrays

that a bottom gate can modulate the contact resistance, but only very weakly.

opposite surfaces, while elastic strain can further modulate the hybridization

universe, in particular the reionization era. Systems of globular clusters in
galaxy clusters are particularly interesting as it is in the progenitors of
galaxy clusters that the earliest reionizing sources first formed. Although the
exact physical origin of globular clusters is still debated, it is generally
admitted that globular clusters form in early, rare dark matter peaks (Moore et
al. 2006; Boley et al. 2009). We provide a fully numerical analysis of the
Virgo cluster globular cluster system by identifying the present day globular
cluster system with exactly such early, rare dark matter peaks. A popular
hypothesis is that that the observed truncation of blue metal poor globular
cluster formation is due to reionization (Spitler et al. 2012; Boley et al.
2009; Brodie & Strader 2006); adopting this view, constraining the formation
epoch of MPGCs provides a complementary constraint on the epoch of
reionization. By analyzing both the line of sight velocity dispersion and the
surface density distribution of the present day distribution we are able to
constrain the redshift and mass of the dark matter peaks. We find and quantify
a dependence on the chosen line of sight of these quantities, whose strength
varies with redshift, and coupled with star formation efficiency arguments find
a best fitting formation mass and redshift of $\simeq 5 \times 10^8
\rm{M}_\odot$ and $z\simeq 9$. We predict $\simeq 300$ intracluster MPGCs in
the Virgo cluster. Our results confirm the techniques pioneered by Moore et al.

intracellular delay. The model examines a viral-therapy for controlling
infections through recombining HIV-1 virus with a genetically modified virus.
For this model, the basic reproduction number $\mathcal{R}_0$ are identified
and its threshold properties are discussed. When $\mathcal{R}_0 < 1$, the
infection-free equilibrium $E_0$ is globally asymptotically stable. When
$\mathcal{R}_0 > 1$, $E_0$ becomes unstable and there occurs the
single-infection equilibrium $E_s$, and $E_0$ and $E_s$ exchange their
stability at the transcritical point $\mathcal{R}_0 =1$. If $1< \mathcal{R}_0 <
R_1$, where $R_1$ is a positive constant explicitly depending on the model
parameters, $E_s$ is globally asymptotically stable, while when $\mathcal{R}_0
> R_1$, $E_s$ loses its stability to the double-infection equilibrium $E_d$.
There exist a constant $R_2$ such that $E_d$ is asymptotically stable if
$R_1<\mathcal R_0 < R_2$, and $E_s$ and $E_d$ exchange their stability at the
transcritical point $\mathcal{R}_0 =R_1$. We use one numerical example to
determine the largest range of $\mathcal R_0$ for the local stability of $E_d$
and existence of Hopf bifurcation. Some simulations are performed to support
the theoretical results. These results show that the delay plays an important
role in determining the dynamic behaviour of the system. In the normal range of
values, the delay may change the dynamic behaviour quantitatively, such as
greatly reducing the amplitudes of oscillations, or even qualitatively changes
the dynamical behaviour such as revoking oscillating solutions to equilibrium
solutions. This suggests that the delay is a very important fact which should
not be missed in HIV-1 modelling.

hydrodynamically-correlated and uncorrelated walkers. This leads to striking
differences in the behavior of the fluctuations around Fick's law, even in the

toward the central regions of the nearby starburst galaxy NGC253 and the
prototypical ultraluminous infrared galaxy Mrk231. In NGC253, the 12C/13C ratio
is 40+-10. Assuming that the ratio also holds for the CO emitting gas, this
yields 16O/18O = 145+-36 and 16O/17O = 1290+-365 and a 32S/34S ratio close to
that measured for the local interstellar medium (20-25). No indication for
vibrationally excited CN is found. Peak line intensity ratios between NGC253
and Mrk231 are ~100 for 12C16O and 12C18O J=1-0, while the ratio for 13C16O
J=1-0 is ~250. This and similar 13CO and C18O line intensities in the J=1-0 and
2-1 transitions of Mrk231 suggest 12C/13C ~ 100 and 16O/18O ~ 100, in agreement
with values obtained for the less evolved ultraluminous merger Arp220. Also
accounting for other extragalactic data, 12C/13C ratios appear to vary over a
full order of magnitude, from >100 in ultraluminous high redshift galaxies to
~100 in more local such galaxies to ~40 in weaker starbursts not undergoing a
large scale merger to 25 in the Central Molecular Zone of the Milky Way. With
12C being predominantly synthesized in massive stars, while 13C is mostly
ejected by longer lived lower mass stars at later times, this is qualitatively
consistent with our results of decreasing carbon isotope ratios with time and
rising metallicity. It is emphasized, however, that both infall of poorly
processed material, initiating a nuclear starburst, as well as the ejecta from
newly formed massive stars (in particular in case of a top-heavy stellar
initial mass function) can raise the carbon isotope ratio for a limited amount

optical system equipped with a focal plane of 512 antenna coupled transition
edge sensor 150 GHz bolometers each with temperature sensitivity of
$\approx300\mu\mathrm{K}_\mathrm{CMB}\sqrt{s}$. BICEP2 observed from the South
Pole for three seasons from 2010 to 2012. A low-foreground region of sky with
an effective area of 380 square deg was observed to a depth of 87 nK deg in
Stokes $Q$ and $U$. We find an excess of $B$-mode power over the base
lensed-LCDM expectation in the range $30< \ell< 150$, inconsistent with the
null hypothesis at a significance of $> 5\sigma$. Through jackknife tests and
simulations we show that systematic contamination is much smaller than the
observed excess. We also examine a number of available models of polarized dust
emission and find that at their default parameter values they predict power
$\sim(5-10)\times$ smaller than the observed excess signal. However, these
models are not sufficiently constrained to exclude the possibility of dust
emission bright enough to explain the entire excess signal. Cross correlating
BICEP2 against 100 GHz maps from the BICEP1 experiment, the excess signal is
confirmed and its spectral index is found to be consistent with that of the
CMB, disfavoring dust at $1.7\sigma$. The observed $B$-mode power spectrum is
well fit by a lensed-LCDM + tensor theoretical model with tensor-to-scalar
ratio $r=0.20^{+0.07}_{-0.05}$, with $r=0$ disfavored at $7.0\sigma$.
Accounting for the contribution of foreground dust will shift this value
downward by an amount which will be better constrained with upcoming data sets.

uncharged rotating black holes evaporating under the maximum mutual information
optimization, their scale invariant rotation parameter $a_*=a/M$ is almost
constant at the early stage but rapidly increase at the very last stage of the
evaluation process. The value of rotation parameter at the final state of
evaporation depends on the initial condition of the black hole. We also found
that the presence of electric charge can cause the black holes lose their
angular momentum more rapidly than they lose mass. The charged-rotating black
holes asymptotically approach a state which is described by $a_*= 0$ and $Q/M =

subject to spin-orbit interactions (SOI). The energy correction originates in
the spin-conserving and the spin-flip transitions. The former are represented
by the orbital angular momentum (OAM) acquired via the SOI. The latter come
from the quantum fluctuation effect. By using our formula, we examine the
relativistic electronic structures of a d orbital chain and L1_0 alloys. The
appearance of OAM in the chain is understood by using a parabolic-bands model
and the exact expressions of the single-particle states. The total energy is
found to be accurately reproduced by the formula. The self-consistent fully
relativistic first-principles calculations based on the density functional
theory are performed for five L1_0 alloys. It is found that the formula
reproduces qualitatively the behavior of their exact magnetocrystalline
anisotropy (MCA) energies. While the MCA of FePt, CoPt, and FePd originates in
the spin-conserving transitions, that in MnAl and MnGa originates in the
spin-flip contributions. For FePt, CoPt, and FePd, the tendency of the MCA
energy with the variation in the lattice constant obeys basically that of the

H-AP utilizes the channel estimates just obtained to transfer wireless energy
to all users in the downlink via energy beamforming. Finally, the users use a

uplink (reserving some harvested energy for sending pilots in the next frame).
To optimize the throughput and ensure rate fairness, we consider the problem of
maximizing the minimum rate among all users. In the large-$M$ regime, we obtain
the asymptotically optimal solutions and some interesting insights for the
optimal design of WET-MM system. We define a metric, namely, the massive MIMO
degree-of-rate-gain (MM-DoRG), as the asymptotic UL rate normalized by
$\log(M)$. We show that the proposed WET-MM system is optimal in terms of
MM-DoRG, i.e., it achieves the same MM-DoRG as the case with ideal CE.

the anisotropic fluctuations. The effect of the background part has been be
studied in the previous work (Zhao & Li, arXiv:1402.4324). In this paper, we
focus on the influence of the anisotropies of the rotation angle. We first
assume that the cosmic scalar field is massless, consistent with other works,

the potential CMB observations. However, if the scalar field is identified as
the quintessence field, by detailed discussing both the entropy and adiabatic
perturbation modes for the first time, we find that the anisotropies of the
rotation angle are always too small to be detectable.In addition, as the main
goal of this paper, we investigate the effect of rotated polarization power
spectrum on the detection of relic gravitational waves. we find that, the
rotated B-mode polarization could be fairly large, and comparable with those
generated by the gravitational waves. This forms a new contamination for the
detection of relic gravitational waves in the CMB. In particular, we also
propose the method to reconstruct and subtract the rotated B-mode polarization,
by which the residuals become negligible for the gravitational-wave detection.

The obtained average ages of the stellar populations in bulges and discs covers

variations of the BMW-algebra originating from the quantum
orthogonal/symplectic duality, which are responsible for the so-called
`Dubrovnik' variation of the Kauffman polynomial. For generic values of the
defining parameters of the BMW algebra, this cover is isomorphic to the BMW
algebra itself, and this fact provides a shorter defining relation for it, in
the generic case. For a certain 1-dimensional family of special values however,
it is a non-trivial central extension of the BMW-algebra which induces a
central extension of the Temperley-Lieb algebra. Inside this 1-dimensional
family, exactly two values provide possibly additional Q-valued Markov traces.
We describe both of these potential traces on the (extended) Temperley-Lieb
subalgebra. While we only conjecture the existence of one of them, we prove the
existence of the other by introducing a central extension of the Iwahori-Hecke
algebra at q=-1 for an arbitrary Coxeter system, and by proving that this

several natural non-vanishing Hochschild cohomology classes on these classical

we use SDO/Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) magnetograms to investigate
the photospheric evolution and Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) data to
analyze the relevant coronal structures. Key features of this quadrupolar
region are a long sheared polarity inversion line (PIL) in the central
delta-sunspots and a coronal arcade above the PIL. We find that these features
are responsible for the production of intense flares, including an X2.2-class
event. Based on the observations, we then propose two possible models for the
creation of AR 11158 and conduct flux-emergence simulations of the two cases to
reproduce this AR. Case 1 is the emergence of a single flux tube, which is
split into two in the convection zone and emerges at two locations, while Case
2 is the emergence of two isolated but neighboring tubes. We find that, in Case
1, a sheared PIL and a coronal arcade are created in the middle of the region,
which agrees with the AR 11158 observation. However, Case 2 never builds a
clear PIL, which deviates from the observation. Therefore, we conclude that the
flare-productive AR 11158 is, between the two cases, more likely to be created
from a single split emerging flux than from two independent flux bundles.

Second, the state variables of the continuum and numerical model are linked via
discontinuous stress constraints on the one hand and spring stiffness, hinge
eccentricities on the other hand. An efficient optimization algorithm that
fully couples both sets of variables is presented. The performance of the
proposed approach is demonstrated with the help of an examples.

dynamics of the state process, $X(t)$, is a controlled stochastic differential
equation with jumps, delay and \emph{noisy memory}. The term noisy memory is,
to the best of our knowledge, new. By this we mean that the dynamics of $X(t)$
depend on $\int_{t-\delta}^t X(s) dB(s)$ (where $B(t)$ is a Brownian motion).
Hence, the dependence is noisy because of the Brownian motion, and it involves
memory due to the influence from the previous values of the state process.
  We derive necessary and sufficient maximum principles for this stochastic
control problem in two different ways, resulting in two sets of maximum
principles. The first set of maximum principles is derived using Malliavin
calculus techniques, while the second set comes from reduction to a discrete
delay optimal control problem, and application of previously known results by
{\O}ksendal, Sulem and Zhang. The maximum principles also apply to the case
where the controller only has partial information, in the sense that the
admissible controls are adapted to a sub-$\sigma$-algebra of the natural
filtration.

this paper, several open questions concerning the commissioning of radiochromic

system in reflection mode; b) if so, can the methods used in transmission mode
also be used in reflection mode; c) is it possible to obtain accurate absolute

  Conclusions: Reflection mode with Gafchromic EBT2 radiochromic film was found
to be a viable alternative to transmission mode. The same methods that are used

stationary pmf is a polytope, allowing it to be expressed as a convex
combination of its extreme points. The extreme points in the feasible set of
pmf's can be computed using graph theory. Therefore, the final information
matrix can be approximated as a convex combination of the information matrices
associated with each extreme point. For nonlinear systems, the information
matrices for each extreme point can be computed by using particle methods.
Numerical examples show that the proposed technique can be successfully
employed for experiment design in nonlinear systems.

wide, non-magnetic, double-degenerate pairings. This is broadly similar in form
to that of the isolated field population with a substantial peak around M~0.6

the primordial separation distribution of their progenitor systems peaking at
relatively larger values and the greater expansion of their binary orbits
during the final stages of stellar evolution. We exploit this mass distribution
to probe the origins of unusual types of degenerates, confirming a mild
preference for the progenitor systems of high-field-magnetic white dwarfs, at
least within these binaries, to be associated with early-type stars.

suffer from random channel gains besides the additive Gaussian noise. As a
result, the instantaneous channel capacity varies randomly along time, which
makes it insufficient to characterize the transmission capability of a fading
channel using data rate only. In this paper, the transmission capability of a
buffer-aided block Rayleigh fading channel is examined by a constant rate input
data stream, and reflected by several parameters such as the average queue
length, stationary queue length distribution, packet delay and overflow
probability. Both infinite-buffer model and finite-buffer model are considered.
Taking advantage of the memoryless property of the service provided by the
channel in each block in the the low SNR (signal-to-noise ratio) regime, the
information transmission over the channel is formulated as a \textit{discrete
time discrete state} $D/G/1$ queueing problem. The obtained results show that
block fading channels are unable to support a data rate close to their ergodic
capacity, no matter how long the buffer is, even seen from the application
layer. For the finite-buffer model, the overflow probability is derived with
explicit expression, and is shown to decrease exponentially when buffer size is
increased, even when the buffer size is very small.

  Directional Scaling to process massive similarity matrices","30 pages, 5 figures",,,,"stat.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  As datasets grow it becomes infeasible to process them completely with a
desired model. For giant datasets, we frame the order in which computation is
performed as a decision problem. The order is designed so that partial
computations are of value and early stopping yields useful results. Our
approach comprises two related tools: a decision framework to choose the order
to perform computations, and an emulation framework to enable estimation of the
unevaluated computations. The approach is applied to the problem of computing
similarity matrices, for which the cost of computation grows quadratically with
the number of objects. Reasoning about similarities before they are observed
introduces difficulties as there is no natural space and hence comparisons are
difficult. We solve this by introducing a computationally convenient form of
multidimensional scaling we call `data directional scaling'. High quality
estimation is possible with massively reduced computation from the naive
approach, and can be scaled to very large matrices. The approach is applied to
the practical problem of assessing genetic similarity in population genetics.
The use of statistical reasoning in decision making for large scale problems
promises to be an important tool in applying statistical methodology to Big
Data.

generally, we investigate a range of smaller molecules by means of exact diag-

are shown to be at odds with simpler mean-field treatments. For molecules with

parallel server systems, where the service rate achieved by a user at a server
depends on both the user and the server. Such heterogeneity typically arises in
wireless networks (e.g., servers may represent frequency bands, and the service
rate of a user varies across bands). Users select servers in a distributed
manner. They initially attach to an arbitrary server. However, at random
instants of time, they may probe the load at a new server and migrate there to
improve their service rate. We analyze the system dynamics under the natural
Random Local Search (RLS) migration scheme, introduced in \cite{sig10}. Under
this scheme, when a user has the opportunity to switch servers, she does it
only if this improves her service rate. The dynamics under RLS may be
interpreted as those generated by strategic players updating their strategy in
a load balancing game. In closed systems, where the user population is fixed,
we show that this game has pure Nash Equilibriums (NEs), and we analyze their
efficiency. We further prove that when the user population grows large, pure
NEs get closer to a Proportionally Fair (PF) allocation of users to servers,
and we characterize the gap between equilibriums and this ideal allocation
depending on user population. Under the RLS algorithm, the system converges to
pure NEs: we study the time it takes for the system to reach the PF allocation
within a certain margin. In open systems, where users randomly enter the system
and leave upon service completion, we establish that the RLS algorithm
stabilizes the system whenever this it at all possible, i.e., it is
throughput-optimal.

GPa) and high- temperature (1500 K) conditions was obtained in two different
polymorphs, antipolar Pnma and polar Ima2, through an irreversible behaviour
under a heating/cooling thermal cycling. The Ima2 phase represents an original
type of a canted ferroelectric structure where Bi3+ cations exhibit both polar
and antipolar displacements along the orthogonal [110]p and [1-10]p pseudocubic
directions, respectively, and are combined with antiphase octahedral tilting
about the polar axis. Both the Pnma and Ima2 structural modifications exhibit a
long-range antiferromagnetic ordering with a weak-ferromagnetic component below
TN ~ 220 K. Analysis of the coupling between the dipole, magnetic and elastic
order parameters based on a general phenomenological approach revealed that the
weak-ferromagnetism in both phases is mainly caused by the presence of the
antiphase octahe- dral tilting whose axial nature directly represents the
relevant part of Dzyaloshinskii vector. The magnetoelectric contribution to the
spontaneous magnetization allowed in the polar Ima2 phase is described by a
fifth-degree free-energy invariant and is expected to be small.

high-energy emission spanning $\sim$20 ks, making it a member of the proposed
category of `ultra-long' bursts. It was also unusual in that its late-time
X-ray emission observed by Swift was very soft, and showed a strong
hard-to-soft spectral evolution with time. This evolution, rarely seen in GRB
afterglows, can be well modelled as the dust-scattered echo of the prompt
emission, with stringent limits on the contribution from the normal afterglow
(i.e. external shock) emission. We consider and reject the possibility that GRB
130925A was some form of tidal disruption event, and instead show that if the
circumburst density around GRB 130925A is low, the long duration of the burst
and faint external shock emission are naturally explained. Indeed, we suggest
that the ultra-long GRBs as a class can be explained as those with low
circumburst densities, such that the deceleration time (at which point the
material ejected from the nascent black hole is decelerated by the circumburst
medium) is $\sim$20 ks, as opposed to a few hundred seconds for the normal long
GRBs. The increased deceleration radius means that more of the ejected shells
can interact before reaching the external shock, naturally explaining both the
increased duration of GRB 130925A, the duration of its prompt pulses, and the
fainter-than-normal afterglow.

structure (cuspy versus core central luminosity profiles), and figure of
rotation (fast (FR) vs. slow (SR) rotators), are determined by whether they
formed by ""wet"" or ""dry"" mergers. We consider whether the mid infrared (MIR)
properties of ETGs, with their sensitivity to accretion processes in particular
in the last few Gyr (on average z < 0.2), can put further constraints on this
picture. We investigate a sample of 49 ETGs for which nuclear MIR properties
and detailed photometrical and kinematical classifications are available from
the recent literature. In the stellar light cuspy/core ETGs show a dichotomy
that is mainly driven by their luminosity. However in the MIR, the brightest
core ETGs show evidence that accretions have triggered both AGN and star
formation activity in the recent past, challenging a ""dry"" merger scenario. In
contrast, we do find, in the Virgo and Fornax clusters, that cuspy ETGs,
fainter than M$_{K_s}=-24$, are predominantly passively evolving in the same
epoch, while, in low density environments, they tend to be more active. A
significant and statistically similar fraction of both FR (38$^{+18}_{-11}$\%)
and SR (50$^{+34}_{-21}$\%) shows PAH features in their MIR spectra. Ionized
and molecular gas are also frequently detected. Recent star formation episodes
are then a common phenomenon in both kinematical classes, even in those
dominated by AGN activity, suggesting a similar evolutionary path in the last
few Gyr. MIR spectra suggest that the photometric segregation between cuspy and

originated before z~0.2.

possible to monitor genomes in great detail. New experiments not only use HTS
to measure genomic features at one time point but to monitor them changing over
time with the aim of identifying significant changes in their abundance. In
population genetics, for example, allele frequencies are monitored over time to
detect significant frequency changes that indicate selection pressures.
Previous attempts at analysing data from HTS experiments have been limited as
they could not simultaneously include data at intermediate time points,
replicate experiments and sources of uncertainty specific to HTS such as
sequencing depth.
  Results: We present the beta-binomial Gaussian process (BBGP) model for
ranking features with significant non-random variation in abundance over time.
The features are assumed to represent proportions, such as proportion of an
alternative allele in a population. We use the beta-binomial model to capture
the uncertainty arising from finite sequencing depth and combine it with a
Gaussian process model over the time series. In simulations that mimic the
features of experimental evolution data, the proposed method clearly
outperforms classical testing in average precision of finding selected alleles.
We also present simulations exploring different experimental design choices and
results on real data from Drosophila experimental evolution experiment in
temperature adaptation.

present a study of H{\alpha} variability in 15 T Tauri and Herbig Ae stars
(K7-B2) over a wide range of time windows, from minutes, to hours, to days, and
years. We assess the variability using linewidth measurements and the time
series of line profiles. All objects show gradual, slow profile changes on
time-scales of days. In addition, in three cases there is evidence for rapid
variations in H{\alpha} with typical time-scales of 10 min, which occurs in 10%
of the total covered observing time. The mean accretion-rate changes, inferred
from the line fluxes,are 0.01-0.07 dex for time-scales of < 1 hour, 0.04-0.4
dex for time-scales of days, and 0.13-0.52 dex for time-scales of years.
  In Costigan et al. 2012 we derived an upper limit finding that the
intermediate (days) variability dominated over longer (years) variability. Here
our new results, based on much higher cadence observations, also provide a
lower limit to accretion-rate variability on similar time-scales (days),
thereby constraining the accretion rate variability physics in a much more
definitive way. A plausible explanation for the gradual variations over days is
an asymmetric accretion flow resulting in a rotational modulation of the
accretion-related emission, although other interpretations are possible as
well. In conjunction with our previous work, we find that the time-scales and
the extent of the variability is similar for objects ranging in mass from ~ 0.1
to ~ 5 Msol. This confirms that a single mode of accretion is at work from T
Tauri to Herbig Ae stars - across a wide range of stellar masses.

is dominated by quasar-hosted blazars, in particular, flat spectrum radio
quasars, and that PeV-EeV neutrino production due to photohadronic interactions
with broadline and dust radiation is unavoidable if the AGN inner jets are
ultrahigh-energy cosmic-ray (UHECR) sources. Their neutrino spectrum has a
cutoff feature around PeV energies since target photons are due to Ly$\alpha$
emission. Because of infrared photons provided by the dust torus, neutrino
spectra above PeV energies are too hard to be consistent with the IceCube data
unless the proton spectral index is steeper than 2.5, or the maximum proton
energy is $\lesssim100$ PeV. Thus, the simple model has difficulty in
explaining the IceCube data. For the cumulative neutrino intensity from blazars
to exceed $\sim{10}^{-8}~{\rm GeV}~{\rm cm}^{-2}~{\rm s}^{-1}~{\rm sr}^{-1}$,
their local cosmic-ray energy generation rate would be $\sim10-100$ times
larger than the local UHECR emissivity, but is comparable to the averaged
gamma-ray blazar emissivity. Interestingly, future detectors such as the
Askaryan Radio Array can detect $\sim0.1-1$ EeV neutrinos even in more
conservative cases, allowing us to indirectly test the hypothesis that UHECRs
are produced in the inner jets. We find that the diffuse neutrino intensity
from radio-loud AGN is dominated by blazars with gamma-ray luminosity of
$\gtrsim10^{48}~{\rm erg}~{\rm s}^{-1}$, and the arrival directions of their
$\sim1-100$ PeV neutrinos correlate with the luminous blazars detected by

determine the sky-projected angle between the normal of the planetary orbit and

orbits and are consistent with alignment with measured sky-projected angles of
$\lambda={8^{\circ}}^{+13}_{-12}$ and $\lambda={-2^{\circ}}^{+17}_{-19}$,
respectively.
  Both WASP-13 and WASP-32 have $T_{\mathrm{eff}}<6250$K and therefore these
systems support the general trend that aligned planetary systems are
preferentially found orbiting cool host stars. A Lomb-Scargle periodogram
analysis was carried out on archival SuperWASP data for both systems. A
statistically significant stellar rotation period detection (above 99.9\%
confidence) was identified for the WASP-32 system with $P_{\mathrm{rot}}=11.6
\pm 1.0 $ days. This rotation period is in agreement with the predicted stellar
rotation period calculated from the stellar radius, $R_{\star}$, and $v \sin i$
if a stellar inclination of $i_{\star}=90^{\circ}$ is assumed. With the
determined rotation period, the true 3D angle between the stellar rotation axis
and the planetary orbit, $\psi$, was found to be $\psi=11^{\circ} \pm 14$. We
conclude with a discussion on the alignment of systems around cool host stars
with $T_{\mathrm{eff}}<6150$K by calculating the tidal dissipation timescale.
We find that systems with short tidal dissipation timescales are preferentially
aligned and systems with long tidal dissipation timescales have a broad range
of obliquities.

for Population II stars in first and second ascent red giant branches. We used
the Spitzer InfraRed Array Camera (IRAC) photometry obtained in the 3.6-8
micron range of a carefully chosen sample of 15 Galactic globular clusters
spanning the entire metallicity range and sampling the vast zoology of
horizontal branch (HB) morphologies. We complemented the IRAC photometry with
near-infrared data to build suitable color-magnitude and color-color diagrams
and identify mass-losing giant stars. We find that while the majority of stars
show colors typical of cool giants, some stars show an excess of mid-infrared
light that is larger than expected from their photospheric emission and that is
plausibly due to dust formation in mass flowing from them. For these stars, we
estimate dust and total (gas + dust) ML rates and timescales. We finally
calibrate an empirical ML law for Population II red and asymptotic giant branch
stars with varying metallicity. We find that at a given red giant branch
luminosity only a fraction of the stars are losing mass. From this, we conclude
that ML is episodic and is active only a fraction of the time, which we define
as the duty cycle. The fraction of mass-losing stars increases by increasing
the stellar luminosity and metallicity. The ML rate, as estimated from
reasonable assumptions for the gas-to-dust ratio and expansion velocity,
depends on metallicity and slowly increases with decreasing metallicity. In
contrast, the duty cycle increases with increasing metallicity, with the net
result that total ML increases moderately with increasing metallicity, about
0.1 Msun every dex in [Fe/H]. For Population II asymptotic giant branch stars,
we estimate a total ML of <0.1 Msun, nearly constant with varying metallicity.

mass loss is one of the dominant processes determining the evolution of massive
stars, and it may provide clues on the evolutionary properties of blue
supergiants. As the H$\alpha$ line is the most oft-used mass-loss tracer in the
OB-star regime, we provide a detailed analysis of the H$\alpha$ line for OB
supergiant models over an $T_{\rm eff}$ range between 30000 and 12500K. We find
a maximum in the H$\alpha$ equivalent width at 22500 K - at the location of the
bi-stability jump. The H$\alpha$ line-profile behaviour is characterised by two
branches of $T_{\rm eff}$: (i) a ""hot"" branch between 30000 and 22500 K, where
H$\alpha$ emission becomes stronger with decreasing $T_{\rm eff}$, and (ii) a
""cool"" branch between 22500 and 12500 K, where the line becomes weaker. Our
models show that this non-monotonic H$\alpha$ behaviour is related to the
optical depth of Ly$\alpha$, finding that at the ""cool"" branch the population
of the 2nd level of hydrogen is enhanced in comparison to the 3rd level. This
is expected to increase line absorption, leading to weaker H$\alpha$ flux when
$T_{\rm eff}$ drops from 22500 K downwards. We also show that for late B
supergiants (at $T_{\rm eff}$ below ~15000 K), the differences in the H$\alpha$
line between homogeneous and clumpy winds becomes insignificant. Moreover, we
show that at the bi-stability jump H$\alpha$ changes its character completely,
from an optically thin to an optically thick line, implying that macro-clumping
should play an important role at temperatures below the bi-stability jump. This
would not only have consequences for the character of observed H$\alpha$ line
profiles, but also for the reported discrepancies between theoretical and
empirical mass-loss rates.

point and uncharacterised sources (down to a few 10^{-15} erg s^{-1} cm^{-2} in
the [0.5-2] keV band). A stacking analysis was performed for the remaining
undetected optical clusters. Main results show that neither of the wavebands
misses any massive cluster (as coded by X-ray luminosity or optical richness).
After correcting for obvious pipeline short-comings (about 10% of the cases
both in optical and X-ray), ~50% of the redMaPPer (down to a richness of 20)
are found to coincide with an X-CLASS cluster; when considering X-ray sources
of any type, this fraction increases to ~ 80%; for the remaining objects, the
stacking analysis finds a weak signal within 0.5 Mpc around the cluster optical
centers. The fraction of clusters totally dominated by AGN-type emission
appears to be of the order of a few percent. Conversely ~ 40% of the X-CLASS
clusters are identified with a redMaPPer (down to a richness of 20) - part of
the non-matches being due to the fact that the X-CLASS sample extends further

results are obtained. The paper first provides a tight expression for the
expected convergence time of the unbiased quantized consensus over general but
fixed networks. It is shown that the maximum expected convergence time lies
within a constant factor of the maximum hitting time of an appropriate lazy
random walk, using the theory of harmonic functions for reversible Markov
chains. Following this, and using electric resistance analogy of the reversible
Markov chains, the paper provides a tight upper bound for the expected
convergence time to consensus based on the parameters of the network. Moreover,
the paper identifies a precise order of the maximum expected convergence time
for some simple graphs such as line graph and cycle. Finally, the results are
extended to bound the expected convergence time of the underlying dynamics in
time-varying networks. Modeling such dynamics as the evolution of a time
inhomogeneous Markov chain, the paper derives a tight upper bound for expected
convergence time of the dynamics using the spectral representation of the

as a sum of certain stationary processes. These results link the possibly
infinite dimensional forward dynamics to classical commodity spot models. We
continue with a detailed analysis of multiplication and integral operators on
the Hilbert spaces and show that Hilbert-Schmidt operators are essentially
integral operators. The covariance operator of the L\'evy process driving the
forward dynamics and the diffusion term can both be specified in terms of such
operators, and we analyse in several examples the consequences on model
dynamics and their probabilistic properties. Also, we represent the forward
price for contracts delivering over a period in terms of an integral operator,
a case being relevant for power and gas markets. In several examples we reduce
our general model to existing commodity spot and forward dynamics.

well-balancing on non uniform grids for the shallow water equations, which can
be extended similarly to other cases, obtaining schemes up to fourth order of

show the expected convergence rates, the correct propagation of shocks across

locally refined non-uniform grid.
  The error indicator based on the numerical entropy production, previously
introduced for the case of systems of conservation laws, is extended to balance

on several tests. The schemes proposed in this work naturally can also be
applied to systems of conservation laws.

~1/20th solar, similar to the mean metallicity of the overall DLA population.
The relatively small velocity extent of the low-ionisation lines suggests that
ESDLAs do not arise from large-scale flows of neutral gas. The high column
densities involved are in turn more similar to what is seen in DLAs associated
with gamma-ray burst afterglows (GRB-DLAs), which are known to occur close to
star forming regions. This indicates that ESDLAs arise from lines of sight
passing at very small impact parameters from the host galaxy, as observed in
nearby galaxies. This is also supported by simple theoretical considerations

Newtonian Dynamics (MOND) because they are observable satellite galactic
systems with low internal accelerations and low, but periodically varying,
external acceleration. This varying external gravitational field is not
commonly found acting on systems with low internal acceleration. Using Jeans
modelling, Carina in particular has been demonstrated to require a V-band
mass-to-light ratio greater than 5, which is the nominal upper limit for an
ancient stellar population. We run MOND N-body simulations of a Carina-like
dSph orbiting the Milky Way to test if dSphs in MOND are stable to tidal forces
over the Hubble time and if those same tidal forces artificially inflate their
velocity dispersions and therefore their apparent mass-to-light ratio. We run
many simulations with various initial total masses for Carina, and
Galactocentric orbits (consistent with proper motions), and compare the
simulation line of sight velocity dispersions (losVDs) with the observed losVDs
of Walker et al. (2007). We find that the dSphs are stable, but that the tidal
forces are not conducive to artificially inflating the losVDs. Furthermore, the
range of mass-to-light ratios that best reproduces the observed line of sight
velocity dispersions of Carina is 5.3 to 5.7 and circular orbits are preferred
to plunging orbits. Therefore, some tension still exists between the required
mass-to-light ratio for the Carina dSph in MOND and those expected from stellar
population synthesis models. It remains to be seen whether a careful treatment
of the binary population or triaxiality might reduce this tension.

simulation of flows where anisotropy or very fine boundary layers are present.
The mean idea is to take advantage of the fact that such structures are
dissipative and that their presence should reduce the number of degrees of
freedom of the flow, when paradoxically, their fine resolution incurs extra
computational cost in most current methods. The principle of this method is to
use a functional basis with elements that already include these fine structure
so as to avoid these extra costs. This leads us to develop an algorithm to
implement a spectral method for arbitrary functional bases, and in particular,
non-orthogonal ones. We construct a basic implementation of this algorithm to
simulate Magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) channel flows with an externally imposed,
transverse magnetic field, where very thin boundary layers are known to develop
along the channel walls. In this case, the sought functional basis can be built
out of the eigenfunctions of the dissipation operator, which incorporate these
boundary layers, and it turns out to be non-orthogonal. We validate this new
scheme against numerical simulations of freely decaying MHD turbulence based on
a Finite Volume code and it is found to provide accurate results. Its ability
to fully resolve wall-bounded turbulence with a number of modes close to that
required by the dynamics is demonstrated on a simple example. This opens the
way to full blown simulations of MHD turbulence under very high magnetic
fields, which were until now too computationally expensive, as the
computational cost of the proposed method, in contrast to traditional methods,
does not depend on the intensity of the magnetic field.

inflation, if the kinetic term is significantly modified at large field values.
This is a simple realization of the so-called running kinetic inflation. The
point is that the Higgs field respects an approximate shift symmetry at high
energy scale. The tensor-to-scalar ratio is predicted to be $r \simeq 0.13 -
0.16$, which nicely explains the primordial B-mode polarization,
$r=0.20^{+0.07}_{-0.05}$, recently discovered by the BICEP2 experiment. In
particular, allowing small modulations induced by the shift symmetry breaking,
the negative running spectral index can also be induced. The reheating
temperature is expected to be so high that successful thermal leptogenesis is
possible. The suppressed quartic coupling of the Higgs field at high energy
scales may be related to the Higgs chaotic inflation.

binary mixtures (species A and species B) of patchy colloids where each species
has a single patch which can bond a maximum of twice (divalent). Colloids are
treated as hard spheres with a directional conical asssociation site. We
restrict the system such that only patches between unlike species share
attractions; meaning there are AB attractions but no AA or BB attractions. The
theory is derived in Wertheim's two density formalism for one site associating
fluids. Since the patches are doubly bondable, associated chains, of all chain
lengths, as well as 4-mer rings consisting of two species A and two species B
colloids are accounted for. With the restriction of only AB attractions,
triatomic rings of doubly bonded colloids, which dominate the corresponding
pure component case, cannot form. The theory is shown to be in good agreement
with Monte Carlo simulaion data for the structure and thermodynamics of these
patchy colloid mixtures as a function of temperature, density, patch size and
composition. It is shown that 4-mer rings dominate at low temperatures,
inhibiting the polymerization of the mixture into long chains. Mixtures of this
type have been recently synthesized by researchers. This work provides the
first theory capable of accurately modelling these mixtures.

spectra of some low-mass X-ray binaries(LMXB) containing a black hole. The two
major groups of QPOs -- low-frequency and high-frequency -- have rather
different properties. That is why they are usually studied separately. In the
literature one can find a large number of models for the high-frequency QPOs
but not so many for the low-frequency ones. HF QPOs have attracted significant
research efforts due to their potential to provide indispensable information
for the properties of the black hole, for its accretion disc and for strong
field gravity in general. However, in order to interpret the data for the HF
QPOs of the observed objects we have to fix a model. Here we propose a simple
test which could allow us to sift the models. The test is based on five rather
general assumptions concerning the nature of the central object in black-hole
binaries and the mechanism for the generation of the LF QPOs observed in the
PDS of such objects. In other words we combine facts that we know about the LF
and the HF QPOs of several objects and search for conflicts. As a result we
single out a model for the HF QPOs -- the 3:2 nolinear resonance model. As a
byproduct of this study we propose loose constraints on the mass of the LMXB H

proves that very strong light confinement can be achieved. Furthermore, this
system enables us to move the nanocavity anywhere along the waveguide. This
configuration provides a significant degree of flexibility in integrated

that higher-order tensors (i.e., multiway arrays) enable such a fundamental
paradigm shift towards models that are essentially polynomial and whose
uniqueness, unlike the matrix methods, is guaranteed under verymild and natural
conditions. Benefiting fromthe power ofmultilinear algebra as theirmathematical
backbone, data analysis techniques using tensor decompositions are shown to
have great flexibility in the choice of constraints that match data properties,
and to find more general latent components in the data than matrix-based
methods. A comprehensive introduction to tensor decompositions is provided from
a signal processing perspective, starting from the algebraic foundations, via
basic Canonical Polyadic and Tucker models, through to advanced cause-effect
and multi-view data analysis schemes. We show that tensor decompositions enable
natural generalizations of some commonly used signal processing paradigms, such
as canonical correlation and subspace techniques, signal separation, linear
regression, feature extraction and classification. We also cover computational
aspects, and point out how ideas from compressed sensing and scientific
computing may be used for addressing the otherwise unmanageable storage and
manipulation problems associated with big datasets. The concepts are supported
by illustrative real world case studies illuminating the benefits of the tensor
framework, as efficient and promising tools for modern signal processing, data

challenging question, which is of wide concern in different disciplines, a

asymmetric between the two parties and, particularly, if the process underlying

equivalently, a watermark value within a software to prove owner's authenticity
and thus to prevent or discourage copyright infringement. Towards the embedding
process, several graph theoretic watermarking algorithmic techniques encode the
watermark values as graph structures and embed them in application programs.
Recently, we presented an efficient codec system for encoding a watermark
number $w$ as a reducible permutation graph $F[\pi^*]$ through the use of
self-inverting permutations $\pi^*$. In this paper, we propose a dynamic
watermarking model, which we call WaterRPG, for embedding the watermark graph
$F[\pi^*]$ into an application program $P$. The main idea behind the proposed
watermarking model is a systematic use of appropriate calls of specific
functions of the program $P$. More precisely, for a specific input $I_{key}$ of
the program $P$, our model takes the dynamic call-graph $G(P, I_{key})$ of $P$
and the watermark graph $F[\pi^*]$, and produces the watermarked program $P^*$
having the following key property: its dynamic call-graph $G(P^*, I_{key})$ is
isomorphic to the watermark graph $F[\pi^*]$. Within this idea the program
$P^*$ is produced by only altering appropriate calls of specific functions of
the input application program $P$. We have implemented our watermarking model
WaterRPG in real application programs and evaluated its functionality under
various and broadly used watermarking assessment criteria. The evaluation
results show that our model efficiently watermarks Java application programs
with respect to several watermarking metrics like data-rate, bytecode
instructions overhead, resiliency, time and space efficiency. Moreover, the
embedded watermarks withstand several software obfuscation and optimization
attacks.
