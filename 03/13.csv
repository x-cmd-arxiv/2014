selected sample of massive, dusty galaxies from $0<z<5.3$. Our sample comprises
29 high-redshift submillimetre galaxies (SMGs) from the literature, and 843
dusty galaxies at $z<0.5$ from the Herschel-ATLAS, selected to have a similar
stellar mass to the SMGs. The $z>1$ SMGs have an average SFR of
$390^{+80}_{-70}\,$M$_\odot$yr$^{-1}$ which is 120 times that of the
low-redshift sample matched in stellar mass to the SMGs (SFR$=3.3\pm{0.2}$
M$_\odot$yr$^{-1}$). The SMGs harbour a substantial mass of dust
($1.2^{+0.3}_{-0.2}\times{10}^9\,$M$_\odot$), compared to
$(1.6\pm0.1)\times{10}^8\,$M$_\odot$ for low-redshift dusty galaxies. At low
redshifts the dust luminosity is dominated by the diffuse ISM, whereas a large
fraction of the dust luminosity in SMGs originates from star-forming regions.
At the same dust mass SMGs are offset towards a higher SFR compared to the
low-redshift H-ATLAS galaxies. This is not only due to the higher gas fraction
in SMGs but also because they are undergoing a more efficient mode of star
formation, which is consistent with their bursty star-formation histories. The
offset in SFR between SMGs and low-redshift galaxies is similar to that found
in CO studies, suggesting that dust mass is as good a tracer of molecular gas
as CO.

falls a factor 240 short of the observed dust masses of SMGs, the well-known
`dust-budget crisis'. Adding an extra source of dust from supernovae can
account for the dust mass in 19 per cent of the SMG sample. Even after
accounting for dust produced by supernovae the remaining deficit in the dust
mass budget provides support for higher supernova yields, substantial grain
growth in the interstellar medium or a top-heavy IMF. Including efficient
destruction of dust by supernova shocks increases the tension between our model
and observed SMG dust masses. The models which best reproduce the physical
properties of SMGs have a rapid build-up of dust from both stellar and
interstellar sources and minimal dust destruction. Alternatively, invoking a
top-heavy IMF or significant changes in the dust grain properties can solve the
dust budget crisis only if dust is produced by both low mass stars and
supernovae and is not efficiently destroyed by supernova shocks.

observables in the context of molecular cloud- and star-formation (SF) studies.
With the Herschel satellite it is now possible to determine the column density
from dust emission. We use observations and simulations to demonstrate how LOS
contamination affects the column density probability distribution function
(PDF). We apply a first-order approximation (removing a constant level) to the
molecular clouds of Auriga, Maddalena, Carina and NGC3603. In perfect agreement
with the simulations, we find that the PDFs become broader, the peak shifts to
lower column densities, and the power-law tail of the PDF flattens after
correction. All PDFs have a lognormal part for low column densities with a peak
at Av~2, a deviation point (DP) from the lognormal at Av(DP)~4-5, and a
power-law tail for higher column densities. Assuming a density distribution
rho~r^-alpha, the slopes of the power-law tails correspond to alpha(PDF)=1.8,
1.75, and 2.5 for Auriga, Carina, and NGC3603 (alpha~1.5-2 is consistent
gravitational collapse). We find that low-mass and high-mass SF clouds display
differences in the overall column density structure. Massive clouds assemble
more gas in smaller cloud volumes than low-mass SF ones. However, for both
cloud types, the transition of the PDF from lognormal shape into power-law tail
is found at the same column density (at Av~4-5 mag). Low-mass and high-mass SF
clouds then have the same low column density distribution, most likely
dominated by supersonic turbulence. At higher column densities, collapse and
external pressure can form the power-law tail. The relative importance of the
two processes can vary between clouds and thus lead to the observed differences
in PDF and column density structure.

  To do this we use an (ideal) triangulation to obtain a coordinate system on
the set of multicurves on $S$. The result then follows from the fact that the
action of the mapping class group of $S$ is piecewise-linear with respect to
such a coordinate system and so we are able so show that: if a mapping class
$h$ fixes a multicurve then it fixes one whose size is at most exponential in
the word length of $h$.
  We go on to show how to repeat this construction on invariant subsurfaces.
This allows us to show that a similar bound holds for the size of the canonical
curve system of a mapping class and so give an alternate, elementary proof of a
result of Koberda and Mangahas.

gyroradius, although particles that have a stronger adiabatic motion (smaller

of stellar interiors and evolution. Hereby, we present the results of the study
of CoRoT 105906206, an eclipsing binary system with a pulsating component
located in the CoRoT LRc02 field. The analysis of the CoRoT light curve was
complemented by high-resolution spectra from the Sandiford at McDonald
Observatory and FEROS at ESO spectrographs, which revealed a double-lined
spectroscopic binary. We used an iterative procedure to separate the
pulsation-induced photometric variations from the eclipse signals. First, a
Fourier analysis was used to identify the significant frequencies and
amplitudes due to pulsations. Second, after removing the contribution of the
pulsations from the light curve we applied the PIKAIA genetic-algorithm
approach to derive the best parameters that describe the orbital properties of
the system. The light curve cleaned for pulsations contains the partial eclipse
of the primary and the total eclipse of the secondary. The system has an
orbital period of about 3.694 days and is formed by a primary star with mass M1
= 2.25 +/- 0.04 solar masses, radius R1 = 4.24 +/- 0.02 solar radii, and
effective temperature Teff1 = 6750 +/- 150 K, and a secondary with M2 = 1.29
+/- 0.03 solar masses, R2 = 1.34 +/- 0.01 solar radii, and Teff2 = 6152 +/- 162

asymmetric modulation observed in the light curve, known as the O'Connell
effect, presumably caused by Doppler beaming. The analysis of the Fourier
spectrum revealed that the primary component has p-mode pulsations in the range
5-13 c/d, which are typical of Delta Scuti type stars.

assist in the routing process, and has been a widely studied subject in sensor
networks. One of the outstanding challenges facing geographic routing has been
its applicability. Authors either make some broad assumptions on an idealized
version of wireless networks which are often unverifiable, or they use costly
methods to planarize the communication graph.
  The overarching questions that drive us are the following. When, and how
should we use geographic routing? Is there a criterion to tell whether a
communication network is fit for geographic routing? When exactly does
geographic routing make sense?
  In this paper we formulate the four principles that define geographic routing
and explore their topological consequences. Given a localized communication
network, we then define and compute its geographic eccentricity, which measures
its fitness for geographic routing. Finally we propose a distributed algorithm
that either enables geographic routing on the network or proves that its
geographic eccentricity is too high.

broad-band Herschel PACS imaging (70, 100, and 160 $\mu$m), we identify
characteristic dust spectra, associated with ejecta layers that underwent
distinct nuclear burning histories. The most luminous spectrum exhibits strong
emission features at $\sim9$ and 21 $\mu$m and is closely associated with
ejecta knots with strong Ar emission lines. The dust features can be reproduced
by magnesium silicate grains with relatively low Mg to Si ratios. Another dust
spectrum is associated with ejecta having strong Ne emission lines. It has no
indication of any silicate features, and is best fit by Al$_2$O$_3$ dust. A
third characteristic dust spectrum shows features that are best matched by
magnesium silicates with a relatively high Mg to Si ratio. This dust is
primarily associated with the X-ray emitting shocked ejecta, but it is also
evident in regions where shocked interstellar or circumstellar material is
expected. However, the identification of dust composition is not unique, and
each spectrum includes an additional featureless dust component of unknown
composition. Colder dust of indeterminate composition is associated with
emission from the interior of the SNR, where the reverse shock has not yet
swept up and heated the ejecta. Most of the dust mass in Cas A is associated
with this unidentified cold component, which is $\lesssim0.1$ $M_{\odot}$. The
mass of warmer dust is only $\sim 0.04$ $M_{\odot}$.

computation to determine the properties of mineralised collagen fibril. The
mechanical and geometrical properties of bone constituents (mineral, collagen
and cross-links) as well as the porosity were taken in consideration. This
paper aims to predict analytically the effective elastic constants of cortical
bone by modelling its elastic response at these different scales, ranging from
the nanostructural to mesostructural levels. Our findings of the lowest scale's
output were well integrated with the other higher levels and serve as inputs
for the next higher scale modelling. Good agreement was obtained between our

They are
capable of accelerating particles to very high energies, so are strong
candidates as sources of detectable astrophysical neutrinos. We study the
effects of particle acceleration and escape by implementing a two-zone model in
order to assess the production of high-energy neutrinos in GRBs associated with
their prompt emission. Both primary relativistic electrons and protons are
injected in a zone where an acceleration mechanism operates and dominates over
the losses. The escaping particles are re-injected in a cooling zone that
propagates downstream. The synchrotron photons emitted by the accelerated
electrons are taken as targets for $p\gamma$ interactions, which generate pions
along with the $pp$ collisions with cold protons in the flow. The distribution
of these secondary pions and the decaying muons are also computed in both
zones, from which the neutrino output is obtained. We find that for escape
rates lower than the acceleration rate, the synchrotron emission from electrons
in the acceleration zone can account for the GRB emission, and the production
of neutrinos via $p\gamma$ interactions in this zone becomes dominant for
$E_\nu>10^5$ GeV. For illustration, we compute the corresponding diffuse
neutrino flux under different assumptions and show that it can reach the level
of the signal recently detected by IceCube.

recent efforts have been devoted to the reduction of computational complexity.
Nevertheless, the existing algorithms are mainly focused on binary images. We
propose here a new fast method for computing the Legendre moments, which is not
only suitable for binary images but also for grey levels. We first set up the
recurrence formula of one-dimensional (1D) Legendre moments by using the
recursive property of Legendre polynomials. As a result, the 1D Legendre
moments of order p, Lp = Lp(0), can be expressed as a linear combination of
Lp-1(1) and Lp-2(0). Based on this relationship, the 1D Legendre moments Lp(0)
is thus obtained from the array of L1(a) and L0(a) where a is an integer number
less than p. To further decrease the computation complexity, an algorithm, in
which no multiplication is required, is used to compute these quantities. The
method is then extended to the calculation of the two-dimensional Legendre
moments Lpq. We show that the proposed method is more efficient than the direct
method.

the basis of a phenomenological connection between Eulerian space-fluctuations
and the Lagrangian time-fluctuations, it is possible to rephrase the Kolmogorov
$4/5$-law into a relation predicting the linear (in time) scaling for the
second order Lagrangian structure function. When such a function is directly
observed on current experimental or numerical data, it does not clearly display
a scaling regime. A parameterization of the Lagrangian structure functions
based on Batchelor model is introduced and tested on data for $3d$ turbulence,
and for $2d$ turbulence in the inverse cascade regime. Such parameterization
supports the idea, previously suggested, that both Eulerian and Lagrangian data
are consistent with a linear scaling plus finite-Reynolds number effects
affecting the small- and large-time scales. When large-time saturation effects
are properly accounted for, compensated plots show a detectable plateau already
at the available Reynolds number. Furthermore, this parameterization allows us
to make quantitative predictions on the Reynolds number value for which
Lagrangian structure functions are expected to display a scaling region.
Finally, we show that this is also sufficient to predict the anomalous
dependency of the normalized root mean squared acceleration as a function of
the Reynolds number, without fitting parameters.

cooperate remains a conundrum. The issue, known as network reciprocity, of
whether population structure can foster cooperative behavior in social dilemmas
has been addressed by many, but theoretical studies have yielded contradictory
results so far---as the problem is very sensitive to how players adapt their
strategy. However, recent experiments with the prisoner's dilemma game played
on different networks have shown that humans do not consider neighbors' payoffs
when making their decisions, and that the network structure does not influence
the final outcome. In this work we carry out an extensive analysis of different
evolutionary dynamics for players' strategies, showing that the absence of
network reciprocity is a general feature of those dynamics that do not take
neighbors' payoffs into account. Our results, together with experimental
evidence, hint at how to properly model real people's behavior.

we calculate between the HCO+ outflow driving force and the Menv and Lbol of
the driving source are comparable to those obtained from similar outflow
analyses using 12CO, indicating that the two molecules give reliable estimates
of outflow properties. We also compare the HCO+ and the HCN in the outflows,
and find that the HCN traces only the most energetic outflows, the majority of
which are driven by young Class 0 sources. We analyse the abundances of HCN and
HCO+ in the particular case of the IRAS 2A outflows, and find that the HCN is
much more enhanced than the HCO+ in the outflow lobes. We suggest that this is
indicative of shock-enhancement of HCN along the length of the outflow; this
process is not so evident for HCO+, which is largely confined to the outflow
base.

orbital periods $P \le 10$ days. Although they lie close to the star, several
have finite eccentricities and significant misalignment angle with respect to
the stellar equator.
  Two mechanisms have been proposed to explain the excited and misaligned
sub-population of HJs: Lidov-Kozai migration and planet-planet scattering.
Although both are based on completely different dynamical phenomena, they
appear to be equally effective in generating hot planets. Nevertheless, there
has been no detailed analysis comparing the predictions of both mechanisms.
  In this paper we present numerical simulations of Lidov-Kozai trapping of
single planets in compact binary systems. Both the planet and the binary are
initially placed in coplanar orbits, although the inclination of the impactor
is assumed random. After the passage of the third star, we follow the orbital
and spin evolution of the planet using analytical models based on the octupole
expansion of the secular Hamiltonian.
  The present work aims at the comparison of the two mechanisms, as an
explanation for the excited and inclined HJs in binary systems. We compare the
results obtained through this paper with results in Beaug\'e & Nesvorn\'y 2012,
where the authors analyze how the planet-planet scattering mechanisms works.
  Several of the orbital characteristics of the simulated HJs are caused by
tidal trapping from quasi-parabolic orbits, independent of the driving
mechanism. These include both the 3-day pile-up and the distribution in the
eccentricity vs semimajor axis plane. However, the distribution of the
inclinations shows significant differences. While Lidov-Kozai trapping favors a
more random distribution, planet-planet scattering shows a large portion of
bodies nearly aligned with the equator of the central star.

dominate the interaction between the small guest molecules and the walls of the

remarkable agreement with experiment. From the experimental point of view, we
show examples in which IR adsorption and Raman spectroscopy are essential to

review that a combination of theory and experiment is crucial to effectively
gain further understanding. In particular, we review such combined studies for
the adsorption mechanism of small molecules in MOFs, the chemical stability of
MOFs under humid conditions, water cluster formation inside MOFs, and the
diffusion of small molecules into MOFs. The understanding of these phenomena is
critical for the rational design of new MOFs with desired properties.

the junction occurs by diffusion and drift processes defined by the spatial
extent of this region. With the advent of atomically thin van der Waals (vdW)
materials and their heterostructures, we are now able to realize a p-n junction
at the ultimate quantum limit. In particular, vdW junctions composed of p- and
n-type semiconductors each just one unit cell thick are predicted to exhibit
completely different charge transport characteristics than bulk junctions. Here
we report the electronic and optoelectronic characterization of atomically thin
p-n heterojunctions fabricated using vdW assembly of transition metal
dichalcogenides (TMDCs). Across the p-n interface, we observe gate-tuneable
diode-like current rectification and photovoltaic response. We find that the
tunnelling-assisted interlayer recombination of the majority carriers is
responsible for the tunability of the electronic and optoelectronic processes.
Sandwiching an atomic p-n junction between graphene layers enhances collection
of the photoexcited carriers. The atomically scaled vdW p-n heterostructures

treatment of galaxy formation, we study the formation and evolution of the
galaxy and cluster population in a comoving volume (100 Mpc)^3 in a LCDM
universe. At z = 0, our computational volume contains 1788 clusters with mass
M_cl > 1.1x10^12 Msun, including 18 massive clusters with M_cl > 10^14 Msun. It
also contains 1 088 797 galaxies with mass M_gal > 2x10^9 Msun and luminosity L
> 9.5x10^5 Lsun. For each cluster, we identified the brightest cluster galaxy
(BCG). We then computed the fraction f_BNC of clusters in which the BCG is not
the closest galaxy to the center of the cluster in projection, and the ratio
Dv/s, where Dv is the difference in radial velocity between the BCG and the
whole cluster, and s is the radial velocity dispersion of the cluster. f_BNC
increases from 0.05 for low-mass clusters (M_cl ~ 10^12 Msun) to 0.5 for
high-mass ones (M_cl > 10^14 Msun), with no dependence on cluster redshift. The
values of Dv/s vary from 0 to 1.8. These results are consistent with previous
observational studies, and indicate that the central galaxy paradigm, which
states that the BCG should be at rest at the center of the cluster, is usually
valid, but exceptions are too common to be ignored. Analysis of the merger
trees for the 18 most massive clusters in the simulation reveals that 16 of
these clusters have experienced major mergers in the past. These mergers leave
each cluster in a non-equilibrium state, but eventually the cluster settles
into an equilibrium configuration, unless it is disturbed by another major
merger. We found evidence that these mergers are responsible for the off-center
positions and peculiar velocities of some BCGs. Our results thus support the
merging-group scenario, in which some clusters form by the merger of smaller
groups in which the galaxies have already formed.

mapping of the averaged planar restricted three-body problem based on the
symplectic mapping of Hadjidemetriou (1993), adding the secular variations of
the orbit of Jupiter and non-symplectic terms to simulate the migration. We
found that, for fast migration rates, the captures occur at discrete windows of
initial eccentricities whose specific locations depend on the initial resonant
angles, indicating that the capture phenomenon is not probabilistic. For slow
migration rates, these windows become narrower and start to accumulate at low
eccentricities, generating a region of mutual overlap where the capture
probability tends to 100%, in agreement with the theoretical predictions for
the adiabatic regime. Our simulations allow to predict the capture
probabilities in both the adiabatic and non-adiabatic cases, in good agreement
with results of Gomes (1995) and Quillen (2006). We apply our model to the case
of the Vesta asteroid family in the same context as Roig et al. (2008), and

three extremely luminous, heavily obscured WISE-selected AGN at z~2 in a broad
X-ray band (0.1 - 79 keV). The parent sample, selected to be faint or
undetected in the WISE 3.4um (W1) and 4.6um (W2) bands but bright at 12um (W3)
and 22um (W4), are extremely rare, with only ~1000 so-called W1W2-dropouts
across the extragalactic sky. Optical spectroscopy reveals typical redshifts of
z~2 for this population, implying rest-frame mid-IR luminosities of L(6um)~6e46
erg/s and bolometric luminosities that can exceed L(bol)~1e14 L(sun). The
corresponding intrinsic, unobscured hard X-ray luminosities are L(2-10)~4e45
erg/s for typical quasar templates. These are amongst the most luminous AGN
known, though the optical spectra rarely show evidence of a broad-line region
and the selection criteria imply heavy obscuration even at rest-frame 1.5um. We
designed our X-ray observations to obtain robust detections for gas column
densities N(H)<1e24 /cm2. In fact, the sources prove to be fainter than these
predictions. Two of the sources were observed by both NuSTAR and XMM-Newton,
with neither being detected by NuSTAR and one being faintly detected by
XMM-Newton. A third source was observed only with XMM-Newton, yielding a faint
detection. The X-ray data require gas column densities N(H)>1e24 /cm2, implying
the sources are extremely obscured, consistent with Compton-thick, luminous
quasars. The discovery of a significant population of heavily obscured,
extremely luminous AGN does not conform to the standard paradigm of a receding
torus, in which more luminous quasars are less likely to be obscured. If a
larger sample conforms with this finding, then this suggests an additional
source of obscuration for these extreme sources.

  Labeling","39 pages",,,,"cs.LG math.OC stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In crowd labeling, a large amount of unlabeled data instances are outsourced
to a crowd of workers. Workers will be paid for each label they provide, but
the labeling requester usually has only a limited amount of the budget. Since
data instances have different levels of labeling difficulty and workers have
different reliability, it is desirable to have an optimal policy to allocate
the budget among all instance-worker pairs such that the overall labeling
accuracy is maximized. We consider categorical labeling tasks and formulate the
budget allocation problem as a Bayesian Markov decision process (MDP), which
simultaneously conducts learning and decision making. Using the dynamic
programming (DP) recurrence, one can obtain the optimal allocation policy.
However, DP quickly becomes computationally intractable when the size of the
problem increases. To solve this challenge, we propose a computationally
efficient approximate policy, called optimistic knowledge gradient policy. Our
MDP is a quite general framework, which applies to both pull crowdsourcing
marketplaces with homogeneous workers and push marketplaces with heterogeneous
workers. It can also incorporate the contextual information of instances when
they are available. The experiments on both simulated and real data show that
the proposed policy achieves a higher labeling accuracy than other existing
policies at the same budget level.

follow similar correlations where the MEC are an extrapolation of the LEC. The
mean separation between MEC members is smaller compared to the cluster Jeans
length than for LEC members. These results are in agreement with a scenario
where stars are formed in hierarchically distributed dusty filaments where
fragmentation is mainly driven by turbulence for the more massive clusters. We
find several young OB-type stars having IR-excess emission which may be due to

about a single talk given at the meeting, recording the gender of the speaker

analyze basic statistical properties of this sample. We find that the gender
ratio of the speakers closely matched the gender ratio of the conference

by women had a slightly higher number of questions asked (3.2$\pm$0.2) than
talks given by men (2.6$\pm$0.1). The most significant result from this study
is that while the gender ratio of speakers very closely mirrors that of
conference attendees, women are under-represented in the question-asker
category. We interpret this to be an age-effect, as senior scientists may be
more likely to ask questions, and are more commonly men. A strong dependence on
the gender of session chairs is found, whereby women ask disproportionately
fewer questions in sessions chaired by men. While our results point to laudable
progress in gender-balanced speaker selection, we believe future surveys of

constrained by measuring the relative lens-source proper motion and lens flux.
The flux of the lens can be separated from that of the source, companions to
the source, and unrelated nearby stars with high-resolution images taken when
the lens and source are spatially resolved. For typical ground-based adaptive
optics (AO) or space-based observations, this requires either inordinately long
time baselines or high relative proper motions. We provide a list of
microlensing events toward the Galactic Bulge with high relative lens-source
proper motion that are therefore good candidates for constraining the lens mass
with future high-resolution imaging. We investigate all events from 2004 --
2013 that display detectable finite-source effects, a feature that allows us to
measure the proper motion. In total, we present 20 events with mu >~ 8 mas/yr.

the lens system. Furthermore, for the most recent events, comparison of the
lens flux estimates from images taken immediately to those estimated from

check the robustness of the single-epoch method currently being used to
estimate lens masses for many events.

power-law cusp (instead of the central core that forms in their absence), but
with a shallower slope. The relaxation rate of the NSC is accelerated due to
the presence of IMBHs, which act as massive-perturbers. This in turn fills the
loss-cone and boosts the tidal disruption rate of stars both by the MBH and the
IMBHs to a value excluded by rate estimates based on current observations. Rate
estimates of tidal disruptions can therefore provide a cumulative constraint on
the existence of IMBHs in NSCs.

generalization of the coset construction valid for internal ones. The physical
equivalence of different representations for spacetime symmetries is not
obvious, since their relation involves not only a redefinition of the fields
but also a field-dependent change of coordinates. A simple and relevant
spacetime symmetry is obtained by the contraction of the 4D conformal group
that leads to the Galileon group. We analyze two non-linear realizations of
this group, focusing in particular on the propagation of signals around
non-trivial backgrounds. The aperture of the lightcone is in general different
in the two representations and in particular a free (luminal) massless scalar
is mapped in a Galileon theory which admits superluminal propagation. We show
that in this theory, if we consider backgrounds that vanish at infinity, there
is no asymptotic effect: the displacement of the trajectory integrates to zero,
as can be expected since the S-matrix is trivial. Regarding local measurements,
we show that the puzzle is solved taking into account that a local coupling
with fixed sources in one theory is mapped into a non-local coupling and we
show that this effect compensates the different lightcone. Therefore the two
theories have a different notion of locality. The same applies to the different
non-linear realizations of the conformal group and we study the particular case
of a cosmologically interesting background: the Galilean Genesis scenarios.

turbulent dynamo and greatly enhances the time-averaged value of the stress to
thermal pressure ratio $\alpha$, possibly by generating vertical magnetic field
that may seed the axisymmetric magnetorotational instability, and by increasing
cooling so that the pressure does not rise in proportion to the turbulent

of magnitude discrepancy between the $\alpha$-values observationally inferred

has an internal origin, this is likely stripped as the galaxies get closer to
the cluster centre. If the gas instead comes from an external source, then our
results suggest that this is more likely acquired outside the cluster

analyse the Tully-Fisher relation of the ETGs with gas disks, and compare them
to EDisCS spirals. Taking a matched range of redshifts, $M_{B}<-20$, and
excluding galaxies with large velocity uncertainties, we find that, at fixed
rotational velocity, ETGs are 1.7 mag fainter in $M_{B}$ than spirals. At fixed

increases, the final amount of mixing increases for Reynolds that are too low

sufficiently high Reynolds number KH flows that can overcome viscous effects,
and develop significant three-dimensional instabilities. While the mixing
generated in the two-dimensional flows, uniform in the span-wise direction, is

Using TNS as trial wavefunctions provides a route to systematically improve the

Carlo with matrix product states (MPS-AFQMC). MPS-AFQMC improves significantly

The computational cost of MPS-AFQMC is then quadratic in the bond dimension of
the trial wavefunction, which is lower than the cubic scaling of DMRG. The
error due to the constrained-path bias is proportional to the variational error
of the trial wavefunction. We show that for the J1-J2 model on two-dimensional

computational framework by providing reductions in variance for different Monte
Carlo estimators, thereby allowing for significantly more accurate results for
a fixed amount of computational time. Common applications of the couplings
include the estimation of parametric sensitivities via finite difference
methods and the estimation of expectations via multi-level Monte Carlo
algorithms. While a number of coupling strategies have been proposed for the
models considered here, and a number of articles have experimentally compared
the different strategies, to date there has been no mathematical analysis
describing the connections between them. Such analyses are critical in order to
determine the best use for each. In the current paper, we show a connection
between the common reaction path (CRP) method and the split coupling (SC)
method, which is termed coupled finite differences (CFD) in the parametric
sensitivities literature. In particular, we show that the two couplings are
both limits of a third coupling strategy we call the ""local-CRP"" coupling, with
the split coupling method arising as a key parameter goes to infinity, and the
common reaction path coupling arising as the same parameter goes to zero. The
analysis helps explain why the split coupling method often provides a lower

the sum of all simple roots and denote it $\tilde{\alpha}$. We formally use
Kostant's weight multiplicity formula to compute the ""dimension"" of the
zero-weight space. In type $A_r$, $\tilde{\alpha}$ is the highest root, and
therefore this dimension is the rank of the Lie algebra. In type $B_r$, this is
the defining representation, with dimension equal to 1. In the remaining cases,
the weight $\tilde{\alpha}$ is not dominant and is not the highest weight of an
irreducible finite-dimensional representation. Kostant's weight multiplicity
formula, in these cases, is assigning a value to a virtual representation. The
point, however, is that this number is nonzero if and only if the Lie algebra
is classical. This gives rise to a new characterization of the exceptional Lie
algebras as the only Lie algebras for which this value is zero.

T2K beam window and with well-reconstructed vertices in the fiducial volume,
the large background rate from natural radioactivity is dramatically reduced.
We observe 43 events in the $4-30$ MeV reconstructed energy window, compared
with an expectation of 51.0, which includes an estimated 16.2 background
events. The background is primarily nonquasielastic neutral-current
interactions and has only 1.2 events from natural radioactivity. The
flux-averaged NCQE cross section we measure is $1.55 \times 10^{-38}$ cm$^2$

of the extragalactic distance ladder. Yet, the galaxy's distance modulus has
long been an issue of contention, in particular in view of claims that most
newly determined distance moduli cluster tightly - and with a small spread -
around the ""canonical"" distance modulus, (m-M)_0 = 18.50 mag. We compiled 233
separate LMC distance determinations published between 1990 and 2013. Our
analysis of the individual distance moduli, as well as of their two-year means
and standard deviations resulting from this largest data set of LMC distance
moduli available to date, focuses specifically on Cepheid and RR Lyrae
variable-star tracer populations, as well as on distance estimates based on
features in the observational Hertzsprung-Russell diagram. We conclude that
strong publication bias is unlikely to have been the main driver of the
majority of published LMC distance moduli. However, for a given distance
tracer, the body of publications leading to the tightly clustered distances is
based on highly non-independent tracer samples and analysis methods, hence
leading to significant correlations among the LMC distances reported in
subsequent articles. Based on a careful, weighted combination, in a statistical
sense, of the main stellar population tracers, we recommend that a slightly
adjusted canonical distance modulus of (m-M)_0 = 18.49 +- 0.09 mag be used for
all practical purposes that require a general distance scale without the need
for accuracies of better than a few percent.

band-theory calculations. Both compounds show a strong monotonic lattice
softening on cooling, where the Debye temperature decreases by a factor of two
from \Theta_D=650K at T=300K to \Theta_D=300K at T=2K. The \chi(T) data for
BiMn2PO6 above 150K follow a Curie-Weiss law with a Curie constant consistent
with a S=5/2 with g=2 and an antiferromagnetic (AFM) Weiss temperature
\theta_CW= -78K. The \chi data indicate long-range AFM ordering below TN=30K,
confirmed by a sharp lambda-type peak in Cp(T) at 28.8K. The band-theory
calculations indicate that BiMn2PO6 is an AFM compound with dominant
interactions J1/kB= 6.7K and J3/kB= 5.6K along the legs and rungs of a two-leg
spin-ladder, respectively. In addition to the long-range AFM ordering at
TN=30K, a second transition at 10 K is observed from the \chi and NMR
measurements but is not evident in the Cp data. The Cp data at low T suggest a
significant contribution from AFM spin waves moving in three dimensions and the
absence of a spin-wave gap. A detailed analysis of the NMR spectra indicates
commensurate magnetic order between 10K and 30K and a possible incommensurate
modulation and/or spin canting below 10K. The commensurate order is consistent
with microscopic simulations that yield a collinear Neel-type AFM spin
arrangement both within and between the ladders, despite the presence of
multiple weak interactions frustrating this magnetic structure. Frustration for
AFM ordering and 1D spatial anisotropy of the 3D spin interactions are
manifested in the frustration ratio f=|{\theta}CW|/TN=2.6, indicating a
suppression of TN from 68K in the absence of these effects to 30K in BiMn2PO6.

bases and their corresponding composite percentages at each pixel, is an
important task for hyperspectral analysis, visualization and understanding.
From an unsupervised learning perspective, this problem is very
challenging---both the spectral bases and their composite percentages are
unknown, making the solution space too large. To reduce the solution space,
many approaches have been proposed by exploiting various priors. In practice,
these priors would easily lead to some unsuitable solution. This is because
they are achieved by applying an identical strength of constraints to all the
factors, which does not hold in practice. To overcome this limitation, we
propose a novel sparsity based method by learning a data-guided map to describe
the individual mixed level of each pixel. Through this data-guided map, the
$\ell_{p}(0<p<1)$ constraint is applied in an adaptive manner. Such
implementation not only meets the practical situation, but also guides the
spectral bases toward the pixels under highly sparse constraint. What's more,
an elegant optimization scheme as well as its convergence proof have been
provided in this paper. Extensive experiments on several datasets also
demonstrate that the data-guided map is feasible, and high quality unmixing
results could be obtained by our method.

outflow velocity and strength with hot dust indicator (beta_NIR) and other
quasar physical parameters, such as Eddington ratio, luminosity and UV
continuum slope, are explored in order to figure out which parameters drive
outflows. Here beta_NIR is the near-infrared continuum slope, a good indicator
of the amount of hot dust emission relative to accretion disk emission. We
confirm previous findings that outflow properties moderately or weakly depends
on Eddington ratio, UV slope and luminosity. For the first time, we report
moderate and significant correlations of outflow strength and velocity with
beta_NIR in BAL quasars. It is consistent with the behavior of blueshifted
broad emission lines in non-BAL quasars. The statistical analysis and composite
spectra study both reveal that outflow strength and velocity are more strongly
correlated with beta_NIR than Eddington ratio, luminosity and UV slope. In
particular, the composites show that the entire C IV absorption profile shifts
blueward and broadens as beta_NIR increases, while Eddington ratio and UV slope
only affect the high and low velocity part of outflows, respectively. We
discuss several potential processes and suggest that dusty outflow scenario,
i.e. dust is intrinsic to outflows and may contribute to the outflow
acceleration, is most likely. The BAL quasar catalog is available from the

X-ray morphology (Spearman rho = -0.79), consistent with an interpretation that
BCGs tend to be off-centered inside dynamically unsettled clusters. 3)

(TiX2, ZrX2, HfX2), the bandgap increases with the tensile strain, but for ZrX2
and HfX2 (X=S, Se), the bandgap starts to decrease at strain 6% to 8%. For the
group-VB TMDCs (TaX2), the tensile strain can either induce the ferromagnetism
or enhance the existing ferromagnetism. For the group-VIB TMDCs (CrX2) the
direct-to-indirect bandgap transition is seen upon application of the tensile
strain, except CrTe2 whose bandgap decreases with the tensile strain even
though the direct character of its bandgap is retained. Lastly, for the

properties of van der Waals (vdW) trilayers via intercalating a two-dimensional
(2D) monolayer (ML = BN, MoSe2, WS2, or WSe2) between MoS2 bilayer to form
various MoS2/ML/MoS2 sandwich trilayers. We find that the BN monolayer is the
most effective sheet to decouple the interlayer vdW coupling of the MoS2
bilayer, and the resulting sandwich trilayer can recover the electronic
structures of the MoS2 monolayer, particularly the direct-gap character.
Further study of the MoS2/BN superlattices confirms the effectiveness of the BN
monolayer for the decoupling of the MoS2-MoS2 interaction. In addition, the
intercalation of transition-metal dichalcogenide (TMDC) MoSe2 or WSe2 sheet
renders the sandwich trilayer undergoing an indirect-gap to direct-gap
transition due to the newly formed heterogeneous S/Se interfaces. In contrast,
the MoS2/WS2/MoS2 sandwich trilayer still retains the indirect-gap character of
the MoS2 bilayer due to the lack of the heterogeneous S/Se interfaces.
Moreover, the 3D superlattice of the MoS2/TMDC heterostructures also exhibits
similar electronic band characters as the MoS2/TMDC/MoS2 trilayer
heterostructures, albeit slight decrease of the bandgap than the trilayers.
Compared to the bulk MoS2, the 3D MoS2/TMDC superlattice can give rise to new
and distinctive properties. Our study offers not only new insights into
electronic properties of the vdW multilayer heterostructures but also guidance
in designing new heterostructures to modify electronic structures of 2D TMDC
crystals.

state in the time domain. We show how this simultaneous suppression of time and
energy uncertainties can be described by a separation of scales and compare
this with the suppression of uncertainties in the two particle correlations of
an entangled state. To illustrate the sensitivity of the frequency comb states
to small shifts in time and frequency, we consider the Hong-Ou-Mandel dips
observed in two-photon interference when both time- and frequency shifts
between the input photons are varied. It is shown that the interference of two
photons in equivalent frequency comb states results in a two dimensional
Hong-Ou-Mandel dip that is narrow in both time and frequency, while the
corresponding entangled photon pairs are only sensitive to temporal shifts.
Frequency comb states thus represent a unique and different approach towards
quantum operations beyond the uncertainty limit.

degeneration of the metric on $M$ where one or more collars are pinched. In
this paper we show that finite-time degeneration cannot happen in the case that
the target has nonpositive sectional curvature, and indeed more generally in
the case that the target supports no bubbles. In particular, when combined with
[16,18,9], this shows that the flow will decompose an arbitrary such map into a
collection of branched minimal immersions.

where a multi-antenna transmitter transmits information and energy
simultaneously to a multi-antenna information receiver and a dual-functional
multi-antenna energy receiver which is also capable of decoding information.
Due to the open nature of wireless medium and the dual purpose of information
and energy transmission, secure information transmission while ensuring
efficient energy harvesting is a critical issue for such a broadcast system.
Assuming that physical layer security techniques are applied to the system to
ensure secure transmission from the transmitter to the information receiver, we
study beamforming design to maximize the achievable secrecy rate subject to a
total power constraint and an energy harvesting constraint. First, based on
semidefinite relaxation, we propose global optimal solutions to the secrecy
rate maximization (SRM) problem in the single-stream case and a specific
full-stream case where the difference of Gram matrices of the channel matrices
is positive semidefinite. Then, we propose a simple iterative algorithm named
inexact block coordinate descent (IBCD) algorithm to tackle the SRM problem of
general case with arbitrary number of streams. We proves that the IBCD
algorithm can monotonically converge to a Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) solution to
the SRM problem. Furthermore, we extend the IBCD algorithm to the joint
beamforming and artificial noise design problem. Finally, simulations are
performed to validate the performance of the proposed beamforming algorithms.

axisymmetric buckled shape, we find a compressive hoop stress with parabolic

value for this hoop stress, where it becomes favorable for the membrane to
buckle out of its axisymmetric shape, thus releasing the compression. The
instability mechanism is analogous to the formation of wrinkles under
compressive stress. A simplified stability analysis allows us to quantify the
critical stress for secondary buckling. Applying this secondary buckling
criterion to the axisymmetric shapes, we can determine the critical volume for

VLT/CRIRES instrument in 2008 (2 spectra) and 2012 (5 spectra), are analyzed to
constrain the spatial and vertical distribution of methane in Pluto's
atmosphere and to search for mid-term (4 year) variability. A sensitivity study
to model assumptions (temperature structure, surface pressure, Pluto's radius)
is performed. Results indicate that (i) no variation of the CH4 atmospheric
content (column-density or mixing ratio) with Pluto rotational phase is present
in excess of 20 % (ii) CH4 column densities show at most marginal variations
between 2008 and 2012, with a best guess estimate of a ~20 % decrease over this
time frame. As stellar occultations indicate that Pluto's surface pressure has
continued to increase over this period, this implies a concomitant decrease of
the methane mixing ratio (iii) the data do not show evidence for an
altitude-varying methane distribution; in particular, they imply a roughly
uniform mixing ratio in at least the first 22-27 km of the atmosphere, and high
concentrations of low-temperature methane near the surface can be ruled out.
Our results are also best consistent with a relatively large (> 1180 km) Pluto
radius. Comparison with predictions from a recently developed global climate
model GCM indicates that these features are best explained if the source of
methane occurs in regional-scale CH4 ice deposits, including both low latitudes
and high Northern latitudes, evidence for which is present from the rotational
and secular evolution of the near-IR features due to CH4 ice. Our ""best guess""
predictions for the New Horizons encounter in 2015 are: a 1184 km radius, a 17
ubar surface pressure, and a 0.44 % CH4 mixing ratio with negligible
longitudinal variations.

mass and the effective weak mixing angle. In this article, we establish a
framework for the calculation of the mixed QCD-electroweak O(\alpha_s\alpha)
corrections to Drell-Yan processes in the resonance region, which are one of
the main remaining theoretical uncertainties. We describe how the Standard
Model prediction can be successfully performed in terms of a consistent
expansion about the resonance poles, which classifies the corrections in terms
of factorizable and non-factorizable contributions. The former can be
attributed to the W/Z production and decay subprocesses individually, while the
latter link production and decay by soft-photon exchange. At next-to-leading
order we compare the full electroweak corrections with the pole-expanded
approximations, confirming the validity of the approximation. At
O(\alpha_s\alpha), we describe the concept of the expansion and explicitly give
results on the non-factorizable contributions, which turn out to be
phenomenologically negligible. Our results, thus, demonstrate that for
phenomenological purposes the O(\alpha_s\alpha) corrections can be factorized
into terms associated with initial-state and/or final-state corrections.
Moreover, we argue that the factorization properties of the non-factorizable

systematically determine the impact of soil grain diameter and surface wetting
property on water channelization phenomenon. The model sandy soils we use are
random closely-packed glass beads with varied diameters and surface treatments.
For hydrophilic sandy soils, our experiments show that rain water infiltrates
into a shallow top layer of soil and creates a horizontal water wetting front
that grows downward homogeneously until instabilities occur to form fingered
flows. For hydrophobic sandy soils, in contrast, we observe that rain water
ponds on the top of soil surface until the hydraulic pressure is strong enough
to overcome the capillary repellency of soil and create narrow water channels
that penetrate the soil packing. Varying the raindrop impinging speed has
little influence on water channel formation. However, varying the rain rate
causes significant changes in water infiltration depth, water channel width,
and water channel separation. At a fixed raining condition, we combine the
effects of grain diameter and surface hydrophobicity into a single parameter
and determine its influence on water infiltration depth, water channel width,
and water channel separation. We also demonstrate the efficiency of several
soil water improvement methods that relate to rain water channelization
phenomenon, including pre-wetting sandy soils at different level before
rainfall, modifying soil surface flatness, and applying superabsorbent hydrogel
particles as soil modifiers.

groups, tribes, linguistic groups and so on. Recently, combining data on human
grouping patterns in a comprehensive and systematic study, Zhou et al.
identified a quantitative discrete hierarchy of group sizes with a preferred
scaling ratio close to $3$, which was later confirmed for hunter-gatherer
groups and for other mammalian societies. Using high precision large scale
Internet-based social network data, we extend these early findings on a very
large data set. We analyse the organisational structure of a complete,
multi-relational, large social multiplex network of a human society consisting
of about 400,000 odd players of a massive multiplayer online game for which we
know all about the group memberships of every player. Remarkably, the online
players exhibit the same type of structured hierarchical layers as the
societies studied by anthropologists, where each of these layers is three to
four times the size of the lower layer. Our findings suggest that the
hierarchical organisation of human society is deeply nested in human
psychology.

Hz^-1) and large radioloudness parameter (R1.4=600+/-100). The radio source is
compact with a linear size below ~1.4 kpc but, contrary to most of the RL NLS1
discovered so far with such a high R1.4, its radio spectrum is very steep
(alpha=0.93) and not supporting a 'blazar-like' nature. Both the small mass of
the central super-massive black-hole and the high accretion rate relative to
the Eddington limit estimated for this object (3.2x10^7 Msun and 0.27,
respectively, with a formal error of ~0.4 dex on both quantities) are typical
of the class of NLS1. Through a modeling of the spectral energy distribution of
the source we have found that the galaxy hosting SDSSJ143244.91+301435.3 is
undergoing a quite intense star-formation (SFR=50 Msun y^-1) which, however, is
expected to contribute only marginally (~1 per cent) to the observed radio
emission. The radio properties of SDSSJ143244.91+301435.3 are remarkably
similar to those of compact steep spectrum (CSS) radio sources, a class of AGN
mostly composed by young radio galaxies. This may suggest a direct link between
these two classes of AGN, with the CSS sources possibly representing the
misaligned version (the so-called parent population) of RL NLS1 showing blazar
characteristics.

include flux tables of identified emission lines, information on the

are investigated while the \para jet is much more symmetric. The density,
temperature, and therefore origin of the gas traced by the Balmer lines are
investigated from the Balmer decrements and results suggest an origin in a jet
for \eso while for \para the temperature and density are consistent with an
accretion flow. $\dot{M}_{acc}$ is estimated from the luminosity of various
accretion tracers. For both targets, new luminosity relationships and a
re-evaluation of the effect of reddening and grey extinction (due to the
edge-on disks) allows for substantial improvements on previous estimates of
$\dot{M}_{acc}$. It is found that log($\dot{M}_{acc}$) = -9.15 $\pm$ 0.45~\Msun

temperature, and ionisation) are probed using various line ratios and compared

signatures of the rigidly rotating magnetospheres (RRM) common to this class of
highly-magnetized ($B \sim 10$ kiloGauss) stars, increasing the number of known
RRM stars by $\sim 10 \%$. One (HD 345439) is a main-sequence B star with
unusually strong He absorption (similar to $\sigma$ Ori E), while the other (HD
23478) fits a ""He-normal"" B3IV classification. We combine the APOGEE discovery
spectra with other optical and near-infrared spectra of these two stars, and of
$\sigma$ Ori E itself, to show how near-infrared spectroscopy can be a uniquely
powerful tool for discovering more of these rare objects, which may show
little/no RRM signatures in their optical spectra. We discuss the potential for
further discovery of $\sigma$ Ori E type stars, as well as the implications of
our discoveries for the population of these objects and insights into their

singular point in the band structure where the connectivity of the Fermi
surface changes. Bilayer graphene is a unique system where both Fermi energy
and the low-energy electron dispersion can be tuned using the interplay between
trigonal warping and a band gap opened by a transverse electric field. Here, we
drive the Lifshitz transition to experimentally controllable carrier densities

Landau levels. These degeneracies are revealed by filling factor -3 and -6
quantum Hall effect states of holes at low magnetic fields reflecting the
existence of three maxima on the top of the valence band dispersion. At high
magnetic fields all integer quantum Hall states are observed, indicating that
deeper in the valence band the constant energy contours are singly-connected.
The fact that we observe ferromagnetic quantum Hall states at odd-integer
filling factors testifies to the high quality of our sample, and this enables
us to identify several phase transitions between correlated quantum Hall states
at intermediate magnetic fields, in agreement with the calculated evolution of

We compute the X-ray and optical luminosities accounting for any possible
source of absorption (Galactic and intrinsic) that could affect the observed
fluxes in these two bands. We compare the behaviour observed in the X-ray and
in the optical bands to assess the relative contribution of the emission during
the prompt and afterglow phases. We unarguably demonstrate that the GRBs
rest-frame optical luminosity distribution is not bimodal, being rather
clustered around the mean value Log(L$_{R}$) = 29.9 $\pm$ 0.8 when estimated at
a rest frame time of 12 hr. This is in contrast with what found in previous
works and confirms that the GRB population has an intrinsic unimodal luminosity
distribution. For more than 70% of the events the rest-frame light curves in
the X-ray and optical bands have a different evolution, indicating distinct
emitting regions and/or mechanisms. The X-ray light curves normalised to the
GRB isotropic energy (E$_{\rm iso}$), provide evidence for X-ray emission still
powered by the prompt emission until late times ($\sim$ hours after the burst
event). On the other hand, the same test performed for the E$_{\rm

better proxy of the afterglow emission from early to late times.

images must have the right size and resolution. Insufficient care in these
choices can lead to wrong results. We present a new general-purpose scheme for
the computation of visibilities of radiative transfer images. Our method
requires a model image that is a list of intensities at arbitrarily placed
positions on the image-plane. It creates a triangulated grid from these
vertices, and assumes that the intensity inside each triangle of the grid is a
linear function. The Fourier integral over each triangle is then evaluated with
an analytic expression and the complex visibility of the entire image is then
the sum of all triangles. The result is a robust Fourier trans- form that does
not suffer from aliasing effects due to grid regularities. The method
automatically ensures that all structure contained in the model gets reflected

of the essential dynamics observed in nature. Different outcomes are observed
depending on the predator strength. For a ""weak"" predator, the swarm is able to
escape the predator completely. As the strength is increased, the predator is
able to catch up with the swarm as a whole, but the individual prey are able to
escape by ""confusing"" the predator: the prey forms a ring with the predator at
the center. For higher predator strength, complex chasing dynamics are observed
which can become chaotic. For even higher strength, the predator is able to
successfully capture the prey. Our model is simple enough to be amenable to a
full mathematical analysis which is used to predict the shape of the swarm as
well as the resulting predator-prey dynamics as a function of model parameters.
We show that as the predator strength is increased, there is a transition (due
to a Hopf bifurcation) from confusion state to chasing dynamics, and we compute
the threshold analytically. Our analysis indicates that the swarming behaviour
is not helpful in avoiding the predator, suggesting that there are other
reasons why the species may swarm. The complex shape of the swarm in our model
during the chasing dynamics is similar to the shape of a flock of sheep
avoiding a shepherd.

linear models, with the first linking the latent temperature series to three
main external forcings (solar irradiance, greenhouse gas concentration and
volcanism), and the second linking the observed temperature proxy data (tree
rings, sediment record, ice cores, etc.) to the unobserved temperature series.
Uncertainty is captured with additive noise, and a rigorous statistical
investigation of the correlation structure in the regression errors is
conducted through systematic comparisons between reconstructions that assume no
memory, short-memory autoregressive models, and long-memory fractional Gaussian
noise models. We use Bayesian estimation to fit the model parameters and to
perform separate reconstructions of land-only and combined land-and-marine
temperature anomalies. For model formulations that include forcings, both
exploratory and Bayesian data analysis provide evidence against models with no
memory. Model assessments indicate that models with no memory underestimate
uncertainty. However, no single line of evidence is sufficient to favor
short-memory models over long-memory ones, or to favor the opposite choice.
When forcings are not included, the long-memory models appear to be necessary.
While including external climate forcings substantially improves the
reconstruction, accurate reconstructions that exclude these forcings are vital
for testing the fidelity of climate models used for future projections.

study the propagation of ionising photons, photoionisation heating and the
resulting distribution of ionised and neutral gas within snapshots of
magnetohydrodynamic simulations of a supernova driven turbulent interstellar
medium. We also investigate the impact of non-photoionisation heating on
observed optical emission line ratios. Inclusion of a heating term which scales
less steeply with electron density than photoionisation is required to produce
diagnostic emission line ratios similar to those observed with the Wisconsin
H{\alpha} Mapper. Once such heating terms have been included, we are also able
to produce temperatures similar to those inferred from observations of the DIG,
with temperatures increasing to above 15000 K at heights |z| > 1 kpc. We find
that ionising photons travel through low density regions close to the midplane
of the simulations, while travelling through diffuse low density regions at
large heights. The majority of photons travel small distances (< 100pc);
however some travel kiloparsecs and ionise the DIG.

the electronic nonadiabaticity in collision processes involving electron-ion
rearrangements. We investigate the state-to-state transition probability for
electron-ion rearrangements with two comparable approaches. In the first
approach the information of the electron is only contained in the ground-state
Born-Oppenheimer potential-energy surface, which is the starting point of
common reactive-scattering calculations. In the second approach, the electron
is explicitly taken into account and included in the calculations at the same
level as the ions. Hence, the deviation in the results between the two
approaches directly reflects the electronic nonadiabaticity during the
collision process. To illustrate the method, we apply it to the well-known
proton-transfer model of Shin and Metiu (one electron and three ions),
generalized by us in order to allow for reactive scattering channels. It is
shown that our explicit electron approach is able to capture electronic
nonadiabaticity and the renormalization of the reaction barrier near the
classical turning points of the potential in nuclear configuration space. In
contrast, system properties near the equilibrium geometry of the asymptotic
scattering channels are hardly affected by electronic nonadiabatic effects. We
also present an analytical expression for the transition amplitude of the
asymmetric proton-transfer model based on the direct evaluation of integrals
over the involved Airy functions.

find hints of a positive correlation between positions of VHE sources and
regions rich in molecular material, which in the best of cases reaches the

be needed in order to firmly establish the correlation.

  in plane strain",,,,,"cond-mat.soft","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The performances of energy harvesting generators based on dielectric
elastomers are investigated. The configuration is of a thin dielectric film
coated by stretchable electrodes at both sides. The film is first stretched,
then charged and subsequently, afterwards it is released, and finally the
charge is harvested at a higher electric potential. The amount of energy
extracted by this cycle is bounded by the electric breakdown and the ultimate
stretch ratio of the film as well as by structural instabilities due to loss of
tension. To identify the optimal cycle that complies with these limits we
formulate a constraint optimization problem and solve it with a dedicated
solver for two typical classes of elastic dielectrics. As anticipated, we find
that the performance of the generator depends critically on the ultimate
stretch ratio of the film. However, more surprising is our finding of a
universal limit on the dielectric strength of the film beyond which the optimal
cycle is independent of this parameter. Thus, we reveal that, regardless of how
large the dielectric strength of the material is, there is an upper bound on
the amount of harvested energy that depends only on the ultimate stretch ratio.
We conclude the work with detailed calculations of the optimal cycles for two
commercially available elastic dielectrics.

first principles quantum mechanics, is fundamental to realistic prediction of
the properties that govern plasticity, fracture or crack propagation in metals.
However, the computational complexity associated with modern schemes explicitly
based on quantum mechanics limits their applications to systems of a few
hundreds of atoms at most.
  This thesis investigates the application of the Gaussian Approximation
Potential (GAP) scheme to atomistic modelling of tungsten - a bcc transition
metal which exhibits a brittle-to-ductile transition and whose plasticity
behaviour is controlled by the properties of $\frac{1}{2} \langle 111 \rangle$
screw dislocations. We apply Gaussian process regression to interpolate the
quantum-mechanical (QM) potential energy surface from a set of points in atomic
configuration space. Our training data is based on QM information that is
computed directly using density functional theory (DFT). To perform the
fitting, we represent atomic environments using a set of rotationally,
permutationally and reflection invariant parameters which act as the
independent variables in our equations of non-parametric, non-linear
regression.
  We develop a protocol for generating GAP models capable of describing lattice
defects in metals by building a series of interatomic potentials for tungsten.
We then demonstrate that a GAP potential based on a Smooth Overlap of Atomic
Positions (SOAP) covariance function provides a description of the $\frac{1}{2}
\langle 111 \rangle$ screw dislocation that is in agreement with the DFT model.
We use this potential to simulate the mobility of $\frac{1}{2} \langle 111
\rangle$ screw dislocations by computing the Peierls barrier and model
dislocation-vacancy interactions to QM accuracy in a system containing more
than 100,000 atoms.

ellipticity is most effective at introducing up-down asymmetry throughout the

self-consistently calculates momentum transport, to permit up-down asymmetric

gradient, $(\partial u_{\zeta i} / \partial \rho) / v_{th i}$, of 5% of the
temperature gradient, $(\partial T_{i} / \partial \rho) / T_{i}$, is
sustainable. Here $v_{th i}$ is the ion thermal speed, $u_{\zeta i}$ is the ion
toroidal mean flow, $\rho$ is the minor radial coordinate normalized to the
tokamak minor radius, and $T_{i}$ is the ion temperature. Since other intrinsic
momentum transport mechanisms scale poorly to larger machines, these results
indicate that up-down asymmetry is the most feasible method to generate the
current experimentally-measured rotation levels in reactor-sized devices.

Systems as they allow users to model continuous movements of entities in the
databases and perform spatio-temporal analysis. For representing and querying
moving objects, and algebra with a comprehensive framework of User Defined
Types together with a set of functions on those types is needed. Moreover,
concerning real world applications, moving objects move along constrained
environments like transportation networks so that an extra algebra for modeling
networks is demanded, too. These algebras can be inserted in any data model if
their designs are based on available standards such as Open Geospatial
Consortium that provides a common model for existing DBMS's. In this paper, we
focus on extending a spatial data model for constrained moving objects. Static
and moving geometries in our model are based on Open Geospatial Consortium
standards. We also extend Structured Query Language for retrieving, querying,
and manipulating spatio-temporal data related to moving objects as a simple and
expressive query language. Finally as a proof of concept, we implement a
generator to generate data for moving objects constrained by a transportation
network. Such a generator primarily aims at traffic planning applications.

and graph-based inference algorithms have allowed reliable learning and recall
of an exponential number of patterns. Although these designs correct external
errors in recall, they assume neurons that compute noiselessly, in contrast to
the highly variable neurons in brain regions thought to operate associatively
such as hippocampus and olfactory cortex.
  Here we consider associative memories with noisy internal computations and
analytically characterize performance. As long as the internal noise level is
below a specified threshold, the error probability in the recall phase can be
made exceedingly small. More surprisingly, we show that internal noise actually
improves the performance of the recall phase while the pattern retrieval
capacity remains intact, i.e., the number of stored patterns does not reduce
with noise (up to a threshold). Computational experiments lend additional
support to our theoretical analysis. This work suggests a functional benefit to
noisy neurons in biological neuronal networks.

interface, given weighted averages of the mixing ratio in a vertical
atmospheric column. In particular we examine the dependence of the posterior
covariance on the weighting function used in taking observations, motivated by
the fact that this function is instrument-dependent, hence one needs the
ability to compare different weights. The estimation problem is considered
using a variational data assimilation method, which is shown to admit an
equivalent infinite-dimensional Bayesian formulation.
  The main tool in our investigation is an explicit formula for the posterior
covariance in terms of the prior covariance and observation operator. Using
this formula, we compare weighting functions concentrated near the surface of
the earth with those concentrated near the top of the atmosphere, in terms of
the resulting covariance operators.
  We also consider the problem of observational targeting, and ask if it is
possible to reduce the covariance in a prescribed direction through an
appropriate choice of weighting function. We find that this is not the
case---there exist directions in which one can never gain information,
regardless of the choice of weight.

As a result, third generation partnership project (3GPP) has implemented next

designed to increase the capacity and speed of existing mobile telephone & data
networks. LTE has adopted a multicarrier transmission technique known as
orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM). OFDM meets the LTE
requirement for spectrum flexibility and enables cost-efficient solutions for
very wide carriers. One major generic problem of OFDM technique is high peak to
average power ratio (PAPR) which is defined as the ratio of the peak power to
the average power of the OFDM signal. A trade-off is necessary for reducing
PAPR with increasing bit error rate (BER), computational complexity or data
rate loss etc. In this paper, two clipping based filtering methods have been
implemented & also analyzed their modulation effects on reducing PAPR.

  Regular Article in Physical Review A",,"10.1103/PhysRevA.89.033851",,"cond-mat.mtrl-sci","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/publicdomain/","  The primary purpose of this investigation is to determine the effective
coherent extent of the neutron wave packet transverse to its mean propagation
vector k, when it is prepared in a typical instrument used to study the
structure of materials in thin film form via specular reflection. There are two
principal reasons for doing so. One has to do with the fundamental physical
interest in the characteristics of a free neutron as a quantum object while the
other is of a more practical nature, relating to the understanding of how to
interpret elastic scattering data when the neutron is employed as a probe of
condensed matter structure on an atomic or nanometer scale. Knowing such a
basic physical characteristic as the neutron's effective transverse coherence
can dictate how to properly analyze specular reflectivity data obtained for
material film structures possessing some amount of in-plane inhomogeneity. In
this study we describe a means of measuring the effective transverse coherence
length of the neutron wave packet by specular reflection from a series of
diffraction gratings of different spacings. Complementary non-specular
measurements of the widths of grating reflections were also performed which
corroborate the specular results. (Part I principally describes measurements
interpreted according to the theoretical picture presented in Part II.) Each
grating was fabricated by lift-off photo-lithography patterning of a nickel
film (approximately 1000 Angstroms thick) formed by physical vapor deposition
on a flat silicon crystal surface. The grating periods ranged from 10 microns
(5 microns Ni stripe, 5 microns intervening space) to several hundred microns.
The transverse coherence length, modeled as the width of the wave packet, was
determined from an analysis of the specular reflectivity curves of the set of
gratings.

outside physics, including in cognitive science. We analyze the applicability
of QM to two basic properties in opinion polling. The first property (response
replicability) is that, for a large class of questions, a response to a given
question is expected to be repeated if the question is posed again,
irrespective of whether another question is asked and answered in between. The
second property (question order effect) is that the response probabilities
frequently depend on the order in which the questions are asked. Whenever these
two properties occur together, it poses a problem for QM. The conventional QM
with Hermitian operators can handle response replicability, but only in the way
incompatible with the question order effect. In the generalization of QM known
as theory of positive-operator-valued measures (POVMs), in order to account for
response replicability, the POVMs involved must be conventional operators.
Although these problems are not unique to QM and also challenge conventional
cognitive theories, they stand out as important unresolved problems for the
application of QM to cognition . Either some new principles are needed to
determine the bounds of applicability of QM to cognition, or quantum formalisms
more general than POVMs are needed.

execution can be mapped to global memory states in a consistent way. While CCM

Nevertheless, it supports assertional, state-based program reasoning using
generalized Owicki-Gries proof outlines (where assertions can be attached to

much more efficiently implemented. As an illustration, we describe a simple
