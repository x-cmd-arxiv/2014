hydrogen-rich type II supernovae. Analyzing a sample of 116 supernovae, several
magnitude measurements are defined, together with decline rates at different
epochs, and time durations of different phases. It is found that magnitudes
measured at maximum light correlate more strongly with decline rates than those
measured at other epochs: brighter supernovae at maximum generally have faster
declining light-curves at all epochs. We find a relation between the decline
rate during the 'plateau' phase and peak magnitudes, which has a dispersion of
0.56 magnitudes, offering the prospect of using type II supernovae as purely
photometric distance indicators. Our analysis suggests that the type II
population spans a continuum from low-luminosity events which have flat
light-curves during the 'plateau' stage, through to the brightest events which
decline much faster. A large range in optically thick phase durations is
observed, implying a range in progenitor envelope masses at the epoch of
explosion. During the radioactive tails, we find many supernovae with faster
declining light-curves than expected from full trapping of radioactive
emission, implying low mass ejecta. It is suggested that the main driver of
light-curve diversity is the extent of hydrogen envelopes retained before
explosion. Finally, a new classification scheme is introduced where
hydrogen-rich events are typed as simply 'SNII' with an s2 value giving the
decline rate during the 'plateau' phase, indicating its morphological type.

the average algebraic rank of elliptic curves in families of quadratic twists

algebraic rank $0$, and the remaining half $1$. We also prove an analogous
result in the family of all elliptic curves. A way to interpret our results is
to say that nonreal zeros of elliptic curve $L$-functions in a family have a
direct influence on the average rank in this family. Results of Katz-Sarnak and
of Young constitute a major ingredient in the proofs.

the assumption of bimodal lognormal, bimodal Grady, bimodal sequential and
bimodal Weibull fragmentation distributions, we suggest that, prior to further
extensive fragmentation in the lower atmosphere, the Ko\v{s}ice meteoroid was
initially represented by two independent pieces with cumulative residual masses
of approximately 2 kg and 9 kg respectively. The smaller piece produced about 2
kg of multiple lightweight meteorite fragments with the mean around 12 g. The
larger one resulted in 9 kg of meteorite fragments, recovered on the ground,
including the two heaviest pieces of 2.374 kg and 2.167 kg with the mean around

into account, in addition to up-to-date phenomenological data, the
contributions related to the renormalization of the flavor-changing neutral
Higgs tree-level amplitude. These contributions were neglected in recent
discussions, albeit formally needed in order to obtain a gauge independent
result. Their impact on the minimal LR model is crucial and twofold. First, the
effects are relevant in $B$ meson oscillations, for both CP conserving and CP
violating observables, so that for the first time these imply constraints on
the LR scenario which compete with those of the $K$ sector (plagued by
long-distance uncertainties). Second, they sizably contribute to the indirect
kaon CP violation parameter $\varepsilon$. We discuss the bounds from $B$ and
$K$ mesons in both cases of LR symmetry: generalized parity ($\mathcal P$) and
charge conjugation ($\mathcal C$). In the case of $\mathcal P$, the interplay
between the CP-violation parameters $\varepsilon$ and $\varepsilon'$ leads us
to rule out the regime of very hierarchical bidoublet vacuum expectation values
$v_2/v_1<m_b/m_t\simeq 0.02$. In general, by minimizing the scalar field
contribution up to the limit of the perturbative regime and by definite values
of the relevant CP phases in the charged right-handed currents, we find that a
right-handed gauge boson $W_R$ as light as 3 TeV is allowed at the 95% CL. This
is well within the reach of direct detection at the next LHC run. If not
discovered, within a decade the upgraded LHCb and Super B factories may reach
an indirect sensitivity to a Left-Right scale of 8 TeV.

by 5"" (0.8 kpc) on the sky have a compact concentration of molecular gas, i.e.,
nuclear disks with Sigma_mol > 10^3 Msun pc^-2. The one at the northern nucleus
is face-on while the southern nuclear disk is almost edge-on. The northern
nucleus is more massive and has molecular arcs and spiral arms around. The
high-velocity molecular gas previously found in the system is resolved to two
molecular outflows associated with each of the two nuclei. The molecular
outflow from the northern nuclear disk is part of a starburst-driven superwind
seen nearly pole on. Its maximum velocity is >750 km/s and its mass outflow
rate is estimated to be > 60 Msun/yr for a conversion factor
N_{H_2}/I_{CO(1-0)}=1x10^20 cm^-2/(K km/s). The outflow from the southern
nucleus is a highly collimated bipolar molecular jet seen nearly edge-on. Its
line-of-sight velocity increases with distance out to 300 pc from the southern
nucleus. Its maximum de-projected velocity is ~2000 km/s for the estimated
inclination and should exceed 1000 km/s even allowing for its uncertainty. The
mass outflow rate is estimated to be >50 Msun/yr for this outflow. There are
possible signs that this southern outflow has been driven by a bipolar radio
jet from an AGN that became inactive very recently. The sum of these outflow
rates, although subject to the uncertainty in the molecular mass estimate,
either exceeds or compares to the total star formation rate in NGC 3256. The
feedback from nuclear activities in the form of molecular outflows is therefore
significant in the gas consumption budget, and hence evolution, of this
luminous infrared galaxy. (abridged)

to the quantization of the $\textrm{SU}(2)$ BF theory discretized on a lattice.
At the classical level, this discrete model characterizes discrete flat
geometries and its phase space is built from $T^\ast \textrm{SU}(2)$. In a
recent paper \cite{HyperbolicPhaseSpace}, this discrete model was deformed
using the Poisson-Lie group formalism and was shown to characterize discrete
hyperbolic geometries while being still topological. Hence, it is a good
candidate to describe the discretization of $\textrm{SU}(2)$ BF theory with a
(negative) cosmological constant. We proceed here to the quantization of this
model. At the kinematical level, the Hilbert space is spanned by spin networks
built on $\mathcal{U}_{q}(\mathfrak{su}(2))$ (with $q$ real). In particular,
the quantization of the discretized Gauss constraint leads naturally to
$\mathcal{U}_{q}(\mathfrak{su}(2))$ intertwiners. We also quantize the
Hamiltonian constraint on a face of degree 3 and show that physical states are
proportional to the quantum 6j-symbol. This suggests that the Turaev-Viro
amplitude with $q$ real is a solution of the quantum Hamiltonian. This model is
therefore a natural candidate to describe 3D loop quantum gravity with a
(negative) cosmological constant.

  Applying the Piatetski-Shapiro $11/12$ Theorem we are able to show that, for
$0<\kappa<6/5$, the mean value $\frac1N\sum_{n\le N}\exp(2\pi i \kappa x_n)$
tends to zero. The case $\kappa=1$ is especially interesting. In this case the
Prime Number Theorem is sufficient to prove that the mean value is $0$, but the
rate of convergence is slower than for other values of $\kappa$. Also the case
$\kappa=1$ seems to contradict the behavior of the first two million zeros of
$\zeta(s)$.
  We make an effort not to use the RH. So our Theorems are absolute. We also
put forward the interesting question: will the uniform distribution of the
normalized zeros be compatible with the GUE hypothesis?
  Let $\rho=\frac12+i\alpha$ run through the complex zeros of zeta. We do not
assume the RH so that $\alpha$ may be complex. For $0<\kappa<\frac65$ we prove
that \[\lim_{T\to\infty}\frac{1}{N(T)}\sum_{0<\Re\alpha\le
T}e^{2i\kappa\vartheta(\alpha)}=0\] where $\vartheta(t)$ is the phase of
$\zeta(\frac12+it)=e^{-i\vartheta(t)}Z(t)$.

radius. Such extremely rare event offers a precious opportunity for the
spacecrafts on Mars to closely study a dynamically new comet itself as well as
the planet-comet interaction. Meanwhile, the high speed meteoroids released
from C/Siding Spring also pose a threat to physically damage the spacecrafts.
Here we present our observations and modeling results of C/Siding Spring to
characterize the comet and assess the risk posed to the spacecrafts on Mars. We
find that the optical tail of C/Siding Spring is dominated by larger particles
at the time of the observation. Synchrone simulation suggests that the comet
was already active in late 2012 when it was more than 7 AU from the Sun. By
parameterizing the dust activity with a semi-analytic model, we find that the
ejection speed of C/Siding Spring is comparable to comets such as the target of
the Rosetta mission, 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko. Under nominal situation, the
simulated dust cone will miss the planet by about 20 Martian radius. At the
extreme ends of uncertainties, the simulated dust cone will engulf Mars, but
the meteoric influx at Mars is still comparable to the nominal sporadic influx,
seemly indicating that intense and enduring meteoroid bombardment due to
C/Siding Spring is unlikely. Further simulation also suggests that
gravitational disruption of the dust tail may be significant enough to be
observable at Earth.

response of a Josephson junction to a perturbation to decide if the
perturbation contains a coherent oscillation embedded in the background noise.
When a Josephson Junction is irradiated by an external noisy source, it
eventually leaves the static state and reaches a steady voltage state. The
appearance of a voltage step allows to measure the time spent in the metastable
state before the transition to the running state, thus defining an escape time.
The distribution of the escape times depends upon the characteristics of the
noise and the Josephson junction. Moreover, the properties of the distribution
depends on the features of the signal (amplitude, frequency and phase), which
can be therefore inferred through the appropriate signal processing methods.
Signal detection with JJ is interesting for practical purposes, inasmuch as the
superconductive elements can be (in principle) cooled to the absolute zero and
therefore can add (in practice) as little intrinsic noise as refrigeration
allows. It is relevant that the escape times bear a hallmark of the noise
itself. The spectrum of the fluctuations due to the intrinsic classical (owed
to thermal or environmental disturbances) or quantum (due to the tunnel across
the barrier) sources are different. Therefore, a careful analysis of the escape
times could also assist to discriminate the nature of the noise.

explicit link between star formation and the local H2 abundance, and perform an
additional simulation in which star formation is linked directly to the density
of cold gas. In better agreement with observations, we find that the simulated
galaxy produces less stars and harbors a larger gas reservoir when star
formation is regulated by molecular hydrogen. In this case, the galaxy is
composed of a younger stellar population as early star formation is inhibited
in small, metal poor dark-matter haloes which cannot efficiently produce H2.
The number of luminous satellites orbiting within the virial radius of the
galaxy at z=2 is reduced by 10-30 per cent in models with H2-regulated star
formation.

to estimate the state of a dynamical system such as the atmosphere. The
Ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) is a family of ensemble-based data assimilation
approaches that has gained wide popularity due its simple formulation, ease of
implementation, and good practical results. Most EnKF algorithms assume that
the underlying probability distributions are Gaussian. Although this assumption
is well accepted, it is too restrictive when applied to large nonlinear models,
nonlinear observation operators, and large levels of uncertainty. Several
approaches have been proposed in order to avoid the Gaussianity assumption. One
of the most successful strategies is the maximum likelihood ensemble filter
(MLEF) which computes a maximum a posteriori estimate of the state assuming the
posterior distribution is Gaussian. MLEF is designed to work with nonlinear and
even non-differentiable observation operators, and shows good practical
performance. However, there are limits to the degree of nonlinearity that MLEF
can handle. This paper proposes a new ensemble-based data assimilation method,
named the ""sampling filter"", which obtains the analysis by sampling directly
from the posterior distribution. The sampling strategy is based on a Hybrid
Monte Carlo (HMC) approach that can handle non-Gaussian probability
distributions. Numerical experiments are carried out using the Lorenz-96 model
and observation operators with different levels of non-linearity and
differentiability. The proposed filter is also tested with shallow water model
on a sphere with linear observation operator. The results show that the
sampling filter can perform well even in highly nonlinear situations were EnKF
and MLEF filters diverge.

silicates and some form of carbonaceous materials, it remains debated regarding
what exact chemical and physical form the carbonaceous component takes.
Contemporary grain models assume that the silicate and carbon components are
either physically separated, or they form a core-mantle structure, or they
agglomerate to form porous composites. The core-mantle model posits that the
mantle is made of some sort of aliphatic hydrocarbon materials and is
responsible for the 3.4 micrometer absorption feature ubiquitously seen in the
diffuse interstellar medium (ISM) of the Milky Way and external galaxies. This
model is challenged by the nondetection of polarization in the 3.4 micrometer
absorption feature as the 9.7 micrometer silicate feature is observed to be
polarized.
  To alleviate this challenge, we calculate the degree of polarization of the
3.4 micrometer feature for spheroidal silicate dust coated by a layer of
spherical aliphatic hydrocarbon. It is found that the 3.4 micrometer feature
polarization still exceeds the observational upper limit, even though spherical
aliphatic hydrocarbon mantles are expected to cause much less polarization than
nonspherical (e.g., spheroidal) mantles.
  We have also shown that the composite grain model which consists of amorphous
silicate, aliphatic hydrocarbon, and vacuum also predicts the 3.4 micrometer
feature polarization to well exceed what is observed. These results support the
earlier arguments that the aliphatic hydrocarbon component is physically
separated from the silicate component unless the 3.4 micrometer absorption
feature is just a minor carbon sink in the ISM.

sufficiently massive binary stars, precessional dynamics may align their spins
$\mathbf S_1$ and $\mathbf S_2$ and the orbital angular momentum $\mathbf L$
into a plane in which they jointly precess about the total angular momentum
$\mathbf J$. These spin orientations are known as spin-orbit resonances since
$\mathbf S_1$, $\mathbf S_2$, and $\mathbf L$ all precess at the same frequency
to maintain their planar configuration. Two families of such spin-orbit
resonances exist, alike in dignity but differentiated by whether the components
of the two spins in the orbital plane are either aligned or antialigned. The
fraction of binary black holes in each family is determined by the stellar
evolution of their progenitors, so if gravitational-wave detectors could
measure this fraction they could provide important insights into astrophysical
formation scenarios for binary black holes. In this paper, we show that even
under the conservative assumption that binary black holes are observed along
the direction of $\mathbf J$ (where precession-induced modulations to the
gravitational waveforms are minimized), the waveforms of many members of each
resonant family can be distinguished from all members of the opposing family in
events with signal-to-noise ratios $\rho \simeq 10$, typical of those expected
for the first detections with Advanced LIGO/Virgo. We hope that our preliminary
findings inspire a greater appreciation of the capability of gravitational-wave
detectors to constrain stellar astrophysics and stimulate further studies of
the distinguishability of spin-orbit resonant families in more expanded regions
of binary black-hole parameter space.

question necessitates characterizing the mapping between structure and
function. The aim of this paper is to discuss broad issues surrounding the link
between structure and function in the brain that will motivate a network
perspective to understanding this question. As others in the past, I argue that
a network perspective should supplant the common strategy of understanding the
brain in terms of individual regions. Whereas this perspective is needed for a
fuller characterization of the mind-brain, it should not be viewed as panacea.
For one, the challenges posed by the many-to-many mapping between regions and
functions is not dissolved by the network perspective. Although the problem is
ameliorated, one should not anticipate a one-to-one mapping when the network
approach is adopted. Furthermore, decomposition of the brain network in terms
of meaningful clusters of regions, such as the ones generated by
community-finding algorithms, does not by itself reveal 'true' subnetworks.
Given the hierarchical and multi-relational relationship between regions,
multiple decompositions will offer different 'slices' of a broader landscape of
networks within the brain. Finally, I described how the function of brain
regions can be characterized in a multidimensional manner via the idea of
diversity profiles. The concept can also be used to describe the way different
brain regions participate in networks.

provides a unique dataset in which surface rotation and variability can be
studied for thousands of stars. Because many of these old field stars also have
independently measured asteroseismic ages, measurements of rotation and
activity are particularly interesting in the context of age-rotation-activity
relations. In particular, age-rotation relations generally lack good
calibrators at old ages, a problem that this Kepler sample of old-field stars
is uniquely suited to address. We study the surface rotation and photometric
magnetic activity of a subset of 540 solar-like stars on the main- sequence and
the subgiant branch for which stellar pulsations have been measured. The
rotation period was determined by comparing the results from two different
analysis methods: i) the projection onto the frequency domain of the
time-period analysis, and ii) the autocorrelation function (ACF) of the light
curves. Reliable surface rotation rates were then extracted by comparing the
results from two different sets of calibrated data and from the two
complementary analyses. We report rotation periods for 310 out of 540 targets
(excluding known binaries and candidate planet-host stars); our measurements
span a range of 1 to 100 days. The photometric magnetic activity levels of
these stars were computed, and for 61.5% of the dwarfs, this level is similar
to the range, from minimum to maximum, of the solar magnetic activity. We
demonstrate that hot dwarfs, cool dwarfs, and subgiants have very different
rotation-age relationships, highlighting the importance of separating out
distinct populations when interpreting stellar rotation periods. Our sample of
cool dwarf stars with age and metallicity data of the highest quality is
consistent with gyrochronology relations reported in the literature.

maximal dimension of the singular loci of forms in the linear system of the

Birch. We say that a system of forms is a Hardy-Littlewood system if the number
of integer points on the corresponding variety restricted to a box satisfies
the asymptotic behaviour predicted by the classical circle method. As a second
application, we improve on a theorem of W. M. Schmidt which states that a
system of homogeneous forms of same degree is a Hardy-Littlewood system as soon
as the so called $h$-invariant of the system is sufficiently large. In this
direction we generalise previous improvements of R. Dietmann on systems of
quadratic and cubic forms to systems of forms of general degree.

holes ($10^{3}$ to $10^{5}$ solar masses) in their cores. Estimates of
~$10^{3}$ neutron stars in the central parsec of the Galaxy and similar numbers
in small elliptical galaxies and globular clusters along with an estimated high
probability of ms-pulsar formation in those environments has led many workers
to propose the use of ms-pulsar timing to measure the mass and spin of
intermediate mass black holes. Models of pulsar motion around a rotating black
hole generally assume geodesic motion of a ""test"" particle in the Kerr metric.
These approaches account for well-known effects like de Sitter precession and
the Lense-Thirring effect but they do not account for the non-linear effect of
the pulsar's stress-energy tensor on the space-time metric. Here we model the
motion of a pulsar near a black hole with the Mathisson-Papapetrou-Dixon (MPD)
equations. Numerical integration of the MPD equations for black holes of mass 2
X $10^{6}$, $10^{5}$ and $10^{3}$ solar masses shows that the pulsar will not
remain in an orbital plane with motion vertical to the plane being largest
relative to the orbit's radial dimensions for the lower mass black holes. The
pulsar's out of plane motion will lead to timing variations that are up to ~10
microseconds different from those predicted by planar orbit models. Such
variations might be detectable in long term observations of millisecond
pulsars. If pulsar signals are used to measure the mass and spin of
intermediate mass black holes on the basis of dynamical models of the received
pulsar signal then the out of plane motion of the pulsar should be part of that
model.

several thousand km. Thus the effect has some similarity with volcanic activity

dependencies between events modelling behavioural relations like causality and
conflict. Since the introduction of prime event structures, many variants of
event structures have been proposed with different behavioural relations and,
hence, with differences in their expressive power. One of the possible benefits
of using a more expressive event structure is that of having a more compact
representation for the same behaviour when considering the number of events
used in a prime event structure. Therefore, this article addresses the problem
of reducing the size of an event structure while preserving behaviour under a
well-known notion of equivalence, namely history preserving bisimulation. In
particular, we investigate this problem on two generalisations of the prime
event structures. The first one, known as asymmetric event structure, relies on
a asymmetric form of the conflict relation. The second one, known as flow event
structure, supports a form of disjunctive causality. More specifically, we
describe the conditions under which a set of events in an event structure can
be folded into a single event while preserving the original behaviour. The
successive application of this folding operation leads to a minimal size event
structure. However, the order on which the folding operation is applied may
lead to different minimal size event structures. The latter has a negative
implication on the potential use of a minimal size event structure as a
canonical representation for behaviour.

by flow past an obstruction such as a surface-piercing ship. In the low speed
or low Froude limit, the resultant water waves are exponentially small, and
their formation is attributed to the singularities in the geometry of the
obstruction. However, in cases where the singularities are closely spaced, the
usual asymptotic theory fails. We present both a general asymptotic framework
for handling such problems of coalescing singularities, and provide numerical

observed that for CR networks using an Aloha-type access to the control
channel, a buffering MAC protocol, where in case of interruption the CR user
waits for the primary user to vacate the channel before resuming the
transmission, outperforms a switching MAC protocol, where the CR user vacates
the channel in case of appearance of primary users and then compete again to
gain access to a new channel. The reason is that the delay bottleneck for both
protocols is the time required to successfully access the control channel,

user clustering approach, where users are divided into clusters with a separate
control channel per cluster, and observe that it can significantly improve the

largely inaccessible at current accelerators -- has become increasingly
plausible given the absence of new physics at the LHC, the success of gauge
coupling unification, and the observed Higgs mass. Indirect probes of split
SUSY such as electric dipole moments (EDMs) and flavor violation offer hope for
further evidence but are ultimately limited in their reach. Inflation offers an
alternate window into SUSY through the direct production of superpartners
during inflation. These particles are capable of leaving imprints in future
cosmological probes of primordial non-gaussianity. Given the recent
observations of BICEP2, the scale of inflation is likely high enough to probe
the full range of split SUSY scenarios and therefore offers a unique advantage
over low energy probes. The key observable for future experiments is
equilateral non-gaussianity, which will be probed by both cosmic microwave
background (CMB) and large scale structure (LSS) surveys. In the event of a
detection, we forecast our ability to find evidence for superpartners through
the scaling behavior in the squeezed limit of the bispectrum.

correctness of originally published ACRIM1 results during the SMM spin mode

that the planet's projected separation is currently decreasing. With
unsaturated data of the entire beta Pic system (primary star, planet, and disk)

demonstrate that there are nontrivial constraints on squark and gluino masses
with baryonic RPV (UDD operators) and show that in fact leptonic RPV can allow
comparable or even lighter superpartners. The constraints from many searches
are weakened if the LSP is significantly lighter than the colored
superpartners, such that it is produced with high boost. The LSP decay products
will then be collimated, leading to the miscounting of leptons or jets and
causing such models to be missed even with large production cross-sections.
Other leptonic RPV scenarios that evade current searches include the highly
motivated case of a higgsino LSP decaying to a tau and two quarks, and the case
of a long-lived LSP with a displaced decay to electrons and jets. The least
constrained models can have SUSY production cross-sections of ~pb or larger,
implying tens of thousands of SUSY events in the 8 TeV data. We suggest novel
searches for these signatures of RPV, which would also improve the search for

emergence of coherence in higher dimensions where no classical simulations are

the focus of a telescope, will increase the sensitivity of orders of magnitude.
Moreover, since it can measure the energy, the position, the arrival time and
the polarization angle of every single photon, allows to perform polarimetry of
subsets of data singled out from the spectrum, the light curve or the image of
source. The GPD has an intrinsic very fine imaging capability and in this work

disentangle the thermal free-free and non-thermal synchrotron radio emission,
from which we obtained the intrinsic synchrotron power-law for each individual
region within the central kpc of NGC1614. The radio ring surrounds a relatively
faint, steep-spectrum source at the very center of the galaxy, suggesting that
the central source is not powered by an AGN, but rather by a compact (r < 90

dominated by starburst activity, without requiring the existence of an AGN. We
also used publicly available infrared data to model-fit the spectral energy
distribution of both the starburst ring and a putative AGN in NGC1614. In
summary, we conclude that there is no need to invoke an AGN to explain the

G-type stellar spectrum at peak, but a few months after peak the lines of the

evolution in time resemble those observed in the spectra of some Type IIn

ejecta are strongly Nitrogen enhanced, as it is observed in modern

strong CN, we are likely seeing ejecta that contributes directly to the

the relative contributions of these components to the B-band rest-frame
luminosity density at different epochs. We present the first estimate of the
evolution of the fraction of rest-frame B-band light in galactic bulges and
discs since redshift z~0.8. We performed a bulge-to-disc decomposition of
HST/ACS images of 3266 galaxies in the zCOSMOS-bright survey with spectroscopic
redshifts in the range 0.7 < z < 0.9. We find that the fraction of B-band light
in bulges and discs is $(26 \pm 4)%$ and $(74 \pm 4)%$, respectively. When
compared with rest-frame B-band measurements of galaxies in the local Universe
in the same mass range ($10^{9} M_{\odot}\lessapprox M \lessapprox 10^{11.5}
M_{\odot}$), we find that the B-band light in discs decreases by ~30% from
z~0.7-0.9 to z~0, while the light from the bulge increases by ~30% over the

formation and mass assembly processes, as well as morphological transformation,

disappeared for one year and is now observable again---an effect possibly
caused by geodetic precession. The LMXB AC211 shows a double lobed structure in

the properties of convection zones in rotating stars and planets. We first
derive mixing-length theory for rapidly-rotating convection, arriving at the

the properties of convection as a function of the imposed heat flux and
rotation rate, independent of microscopic diffusivities. In particular, it
predicts the mean temperature gradient; the rms velocity and temperature
fluctuations; and the size of the eddies that dominate heat transport. We test
all of these predictions with high resolution three-dimensional hydrodynamical
simulations of Boussinesq convection in a Cartesian box. The results agree
remarkably well with the theory across more than two orders of magnitude in
rotation rate. For example, the temperature gradient is predicted to scale as
the rotation rate to the 4/5th power at fixed flux, and the simulations yield
$0.75\pm 0.06$. We conclude that the mixing length theory is a solid foundation

mesodynamics, the mass points, rather than being atoms, are mesoscopic in size,
for instance representing the centers of mass of polycrystalline grains or
molecules. In order to reproduce many of the overall features of fully
atomistic MD, which is inherently more expensive, the equations of motion in
mesodynamics must be derivable from an interaction potential that is faithful
to the compressive equation of state, as well as to tensile de-cohesion that
occurs along the boundaries of the mesoscale units. Moreover, mesodynamics
diffrers from Newton's equations of motion in that dissipation -- the exchange
of energy between mesoparticles and their internal degrees of freedom (DoFs) --
must be described, and so should the transfer of energy between the internal
modes of neighboring mesoparticles. We present a formulation where energy
transfer between the internal modes of a mesoparticle and its external
center-of-mass DoFs occurs in the phase space of mesoparticle coordinates,
rather than momenta, resulting in a Galilean invariant formulation that
conserves total linear momentum and energy (including the energy internal to
the mesoparticles). We show that this approach can be used to describe, in
addition to mesoscale problems, conduction electrons in atomic-level
simulations of metals, and we demonstrate applications of mesodynamics to
shockwave propagation and thermal transport.

distance determinations for the 209 likely and 87 possible catalogued PAGB

meaningful physical characteristics for these sources and this has been
difficult to determine for most objects previously. The distances were
determined by modelling their spectral energy distributions (SED) with multiple
black-body curves, and integrating under the overall fit to determine the total
distance-dependent flux. This method works because the luminosity of these
central stars is very nearly constant from the tip of the AGB phase to the
beginning of the white-dwarf cooling track. This then enables us to use a
standard-candle luminosity to estimate the SED distances. For Galactic thin
disk PAGB objects, we use three luminosity bins based on typical observational
characteristics, ranging between 3500 and 12000 L_sun. We further adopt a
default luminosity of 1700 L_sun for all halo PAGB objects. We have also
applied the above technique to a further sample of 69 related nebulae not in

with supporting different connection profiles, including real-time traffic and

the need to better understand the fundamental limits of forward error
correction in non-asymptotic regimes. This article characterizes the
performance of random block codes over finite-state channels and evaluates
their queueing performance under maximum-likelihood decoding. In particular,
classical results from information theory are revisited in the context of
channels with rare transitions, and bounds on the probabilities of decoding
failure are derived for random codes. This creates an analysis framework where
channel dependencies within and across codewords are preserved. Such results
are subsequently integrated into a queueing problem formulation. For instance,
it is shown that, for random coding on the Gilbert-Elliott channel, the
performance analysis based on upper bounds on error probability provides very
good estimates of system performance and optimum code parameters. Overall, this
study offers new insights about the impact of channel correlation on the
performance of delay-aware, point-to-point communication links. It also
provides novel guidelines on how to select code rates and block lengths for
real-time traffic over wireless communication infrastructures.

pessimistic calculation of the extra power that needs to be removed by the
cryosystem. Finally, we also estimate---under the assumption that all the wake
power ends up in the SRF walls---the wall heating and the extent of Cooper pair
breaking in L3, where the bunch is most intense. Note that all calculations

remarkable improvement relative to ""standard"" PT (SPT) at similar order. In
this brief note I show that the same final equation can be derived cleanly from
the point of view not of flowing with time but with non-linear coupling
strength, i.e., gradually dialing the coupling from the trivial value zero to
the physical one. This understanding makes it clear how to extend the approach
to higher order and other statistics. While I do not necessarily think this
approach is best among the many, it may be interesting in that it contains a
unique way of suppressing UV sensitivity. In passing I remind the reader of
references demonstrating that SPT works remarkably well without improvement
(except near redshift zero, where, fortunately for SPT, there is very little

solar metallicity, with the goal of understanding whether radial pulsations set
a physical upper limit to stellar mass. Models of up to 938 solar masses are
constructed with the Mesa code, and their linear stability in the fundamental
mode, assumed to be the most dangerous, is analysed with a fully nonadiabatic
method. Models above 100 MSun have extended tenuous atmospheres (""shelves"")
that affect the stability of the fundamental. Even when positive, this growth
rate is small, in agreement with previous results. We argue that small growth
rates lead to saturation at small amplitudes that are not dangerous to the
star. A mechanism for saturation is demonstrated involving nonlinear parametric
coupling to short-wavelength g modes and the damping of the latter by radiative
diffusion. The shelves are subject to much more rapidly growing strange modes.
This also agrees with previous results but is extended here to higher masses.
The strange modes probably saturate via shocks rather than mode coupling but
have very small amplitudes in the core, where almost all of the stellar mass
resides. Although our stellar models are hydrostatic, the structure of their
outer parts suggests that optically thick winds, driven by some combination of
radiation pressure, transsonic convection, and strange modes, are more likely
than pulsation in the fundamental mode to limit the main-sequence lifetime.

Specifically, we ask whether they arise from mathematical properties of the

the median. We propose a strong form of network paradoxes, based on utilizing
the median, and validate it empirically using data from two online social
networks. Specifically, we show that for any user the majority of user's
friends and followers have more friends, followers, etc. than the user, and
that this cannot be explained by statistical properties of sampling. Next, we
explore the behavioral origins of the paradoxes by using the shuffle test to
remove correlations between node degrees and attributes. We find that paradoxes
for the mean persist in the shuffled network, but not for the median. We
demonstrate that strong paradoxes arise due to the assortativity of user
attributes, including degree, and correlation between degree and attribute.

renormalisation group method, increasingly large scales are studied in a
progressive manner, with an interaction parametrised by a field polynomial
which evolves with the scale under the renormalisation group map. In our
context, the progressive analysis is performed via a finite-range covariance
decomposition. Perturbative calculations are used to track the flow of the
coupling constants of the evolving polynomial, but on their own perturbative
calculations are insufficient to control error terms and to obtain
mathematically rigorous results. In this paper, we define an additional
non-perturbative coordinate, which together with the flow of coupling constants
defines the complete evolution of the renormalisation group map. We specify
conditions under which the non-perturbative coordinate is contractive under a
single renormalisation group step. Our framework is essentially combinatorial,
but its implementation relies on analytic results developed earlier in the
series of papers. The results of this paper are applied elsewhere to analyse
the critical behaviour of the 4-dimensional continuous-time weakly
self-avoiding walk and of the 4-dimensional $n$-component $|\varphi|^4$ model.
In particular, the existence of a logarithmic correction to mean-field scaling
for the susceptibility can be proved for both models, together with other facts
about critical exponents and critical behaviour.

two closely related 2-dimensional driven systems described by Floquet operators

the following. Firstly, the CS is associated with the existence of the
anomalous counter-propagating (ACP) modes reported recently. Specifically, we
show that a particular form of CS protects the ACP modes occurring at
quasienergies of $\pm \pi$. We also find that these modes are only present
along selected boundaries, suggesting that they are a weak topological effect.
Secondly, we find that CS can give rise to protected $0$ and $\pi$ quasienergy
modes, and that the number of these modes may increase without bound as we tune
up certain system parameters. Like the ACP modes, these $0$ and $\pi$ modes
also appear only along selected boundaries and thus appear to be a weak
topological effect. To our knowledge, this work represents the first detailed
study of weak topological effects in periodically driven systems. Our findings

contains important clues about the size and composition of interstellar dust.
While the ultraviolet (UV) and visible interstellar extinction is well studied
and can be closely fitted in terms of various dust mixtures (e.g., the
silicategraphite mixture), the infrared (IR) extinction is not well understood,
particularly, the mid-IR extinction in the 3-8 micron wavelength range is
rather flat (or ""gray"") and is inconsistent with the standard Mathis, Rumpl, &
Nordsieck (MRN) silicate-graphite dust model. We attempt to reproduce the flat
IR extinction by exploring various dust sizes and species, including amorphous
silicate, graphite, amorphous carbon and iron. We find that the flat IR
extinction is best explained in terms of micrometer-sized amorphous carbon dust
which consumes ~ 60 carbon atoms per million hydrogen atoms (i.e., C/H ~ 60
ppm). To account for the observed UV/visible and near-IR extinction, the
silicate-graphite model requires Si/H ~ 34 ppm and C/H ~ 292 ppm. We conclude
that the extinction from the UV to the mid-IR could be closely reproduced by a
mixture of submicrometer-sized amorphous silicate dust, submicrometer-sized
graphitic dust, and micrometer-sized amorphous carbon dust, at the expense of
excess C available in the ISM (i.e., this model requires a solid-phase C
abundance of C/H ~ 352 ppm, considerably exceeding what could be available in

corresponding ensembles of ensembles. In the final part after measuring the

maximizing an objective of the quantile function of the decision variable. This
quantile optimization problem is known as the quantile formulation of the

schemes to solve such quantile optimization problems have been proposed in the
literature. In this paper, we propose a change-of-variable and relaxation
method to solve the quantile optimization problems without using the calculus
of variations or making any monotonicity assumptions. The method is
demonstrated through a portfolio choice problem under rank-dependent utility
theory (RDUT). We show that this problem is equivalent to a classical Merton's
portfolio choice problem under expected utility theory with the same utility
function but a different pricing kernel explicitly determined by the given
pricing kernel and probability weighting function. With this result, the
feasibility, well-posedness, attainability and uniqueness issues for the
portfolio choice problem under RDUT are solved. It is also shown that solving
functional optimization problems may reduce to solving probabilistic
optimization problems. The method is applicable to general models with
law-invariant preference measures including portfolio choice models under

method pools presence-only and presence-absence data for many species and
maximizes a joint likelihood, simultaneously estimating and adjusting for the

efficiently estimate the bias and improve our inference from presence-only

  We evaluate our model's performance on data for 36 eucalypt species in

$c$-causet $x$ enables us to uniquely specify $x$ by a sequence
$\brac{s_j(x)}$, $j=0,1,2,\ldots$, of positive integers called a shell sequence
of $x$. A $c$-causet $x$ describes the microscopic structure of a possible
universe at a particular time step. In general, $x$ represents one of many
universes in a multiverse and $x$ grows by a single element at each time step.
Since early stages of a universe were probably composed of elementary
particles, we propose that elementary particles can be described by simple
$c$-causets. Although we do not have a rigorous theory for such a description,
we present our guess as to how it might appear. The shell sequence can be
applied to find theoretical masses of particles and these seem to approximately
agree with known masses. We point out that the causal order provides a
unification of the strong and weak forces for elementary particles and also
determines the geometry of $c$-causets which describes gravity. Moreover, it
appears that some particles correspond to dark matter-energy.

$L^{-2D+3}$, $L^{-2D+1}$ and $L^{-2D-1}$ respectively for Dirichlet-Dirichlet,
Dirichlet-Neumann and Neumann-Neumann boundary conditions, where $L$ is the
center-to-center distance of the two spheres. In the small separation regime,
we confirm that the leading term of the Casimir interaction agrees with the
proximity force approximation, which is of order $d^{-\frac{D+1}{2}}$, where
$d$ is the distance between the two spheres. Another main result of this work
is the analytic computations of the next-to-leading order term in the small

extremely low currents needed to move them. In particular, skyrmion-based
racetrack memory is attractive for information technology, where skyrmions are
used to store information as data bits instead of traditional domain walls.
Here we numerically demonstrate the impacts of skyrmion-skyrmion and
skyrmion-edge repulsions on the feasibility of skyrmion-based racetrack memory.
The reliable and practicable spacing between consecutive skyrmionic bits on the
racetrack as well as the ability to adjust it are investigated. Clogging of
skyrmionic bits is found at the end of the racetrack, leading to the reduction
of skyrmion size. Further, we demonstrate an effective and simple method to
avoid the clogging of skyrmionic bits, which ensures the elimination of
skyrmionic bits beyond the reading element. Our results give guidance for the
design and development of future skyrmion-based racetrack memory.

to trigger explosions and a three-flavor neutrino leakage scheme to treat
deleptonization effects and neutrino losses from proto-neutron star interior.
Using a 15 solar mass progenitor, we compute thirty models in 3D with a wide
variety of initial angular momentum and light-bulb neutrino luminosity. We find
that the rotation can help onset of neutrino-driven explosions for the models
in which the initial angular momentum is matched to that obtained in recent
stellar evolutionary calculations (0.3-3 rad/s at the center). For the models
with larger initial angular momentum, the shock surface deforms to be more
oblate due to larger centrifugal force. This makes not only a gain region more
concentrated around the equatorial plane, but also the mass in the gain region
bigger. As a result, buoyant bubbles tend to be coherently formed and rise in
the equatorial region, which pushes the revived shock ever larger radii until a
global explosion is triggered. We find that these are the main reasons that the
preferred direction of explosion in 3D rotating models is often perpendicular
to the spin axis, which is in sharp contrast to the polar explosions around the
axis that was obtained in previous 2D simulations.

nearby GRB event ~500 parsecs away, which should occur about once per 5 Gy,
might have triggered the Cambrian explosion. Due to a relatively lower cross
section and the conservation of photon number in Compton scattering, a
substantial fraction of the GRB photons can reach the sea level and would
induce DNA mutations in organisms protected by a shallow layer of water or
soil, thus expediting the bio-diversification. This possibility of inducing
genetic mutations is unique among all candidate sources for major incidents in
the history of bio-evolution. A possible evidence would be the anomalous

First, we show, using the L\'evy-Khintchine formula, that any shift-invariant

function (pdf) of an infinitely divisible distribution on $\mathbb{R}^d$ is
characteristic. We also present some closure property of such characteristic

developing various kernel mean algorithms, it is fundamental to compute the
following values: (i) kernel mean values $m_P(x)$, $x \in \mathcal{X}$, and
(ii) kernel mean RKHS inner products ${\left\langle m_P, m_Q

pdfs that is tractable. We generalize this Gaussian combination to more general
cases in the class of infinitely divisible distributions. We then introduce a

representable actions of finite groups on C*-algebras satisfying a certain
UHF-absorption condition. We show that given any finite group $G$ and a
separable, unital C*-algebra $A$ that absorbs $M_{|G|^\infty}$ tensorially, one
can lift any group homomorphism $G\to\operatorname{Aut}(A)/{\approx_u}$ to an
honest Rokhlin action $\gamma$ of $G$ on $A$. Unitality may be dropped in
favour of stable rank one or being stable. If $A$ belongs to a certain class of
C*-algebras that is classifiable by a suitable invariant (e.g. $K$-theory),
then in fact every $G$-action on the invariant lifts to a Rokhlin action of $G$
on $A$. For the crossed product C*-algebra $A\rtimes_\gamma G$ of a Rokhlin
action on a UHF-absorbing C*-algebra, an inductive limit decomposition is
obtained in terms of $A$ and $\gamma$. If $G$ is assumed to be abelian, then
the dual action $\hat{\gamma}$ is locally representable in a very strong sense.
We then show how some well-known constructions of finite group actions with
certain predescribed properties can be recovered and extended by the main
results of this paper, when paired with known classification theorems. Among
these is Blackadar's famous construction of symmetries on the CAR algebra whose
fixed point algebras have non-trivial $K_1$-groups. Lastly, we use the results
of this paper to reduce the UCT problem for separable, nuclear C*-algebras to a
question about certain finite group actions on $\mathcal{O}_2$.

has been widely questioned. In the widely described picture, irrespective of
what initial state a black hole starts with before collapsing, it eventually
evolves into a thermal state of Hawking radiations after the black hole is
exhausted. This scenario violates the principle of unitarity as required for
quantum mechanics and leads to the acclaimed ""information loss paradox"". This
paradox has become an obstacle or a reversed touchstone for any possible theory
to unify the gravity and quantum mechanics. Based on the results from Hawking
radiation as tunneling, we recently show that Hawking radiations can carry off
all information about the collapsed matter in a black hole. After discovering
the existence of information-carrying correlation, we show in great detail that
entropy is conserved for Hawking radiation based on standard probability theory
and statistics. We claim that information previously considered lost remains
hidden inside Hawking radiation. More specifically, it is encoded into
correlations between Hawking radiations. Our study thus establishes harmony
between Harking radiation and the unitarity of quantum mechanics, which
establishes the basis for a significant milestone towards resolving the
long-standing information loss paradox. The paper provides a brief review of
the exciting development on Hawking raidation. In addition to summarize our own
work on this subject, we compare and address other related studies.

number of interesting data mining tasks have been exploited in this kind of
networks, such as similarity measure, clustering, and classification. Although
evaluating the importance of objects has been well studied in homogeneous
networks, it is not yet exploited in heterogeneous networks. In this paper, we
study the ranking problem in heterogeneous networks and propose the HRank
framework to evaluate the importance of multiple types of objects and meta
paths. Since the importance of objects depends upon the meta paths in
heterogeneous networks, HRank develops a path based random walk process.
Moreover, a constrained meta path is proposed to subtly capture the rich
semantics in heterogeneous networks. Furthermore, HRank can simultaneously
determine the importance of objects and meta paths through applying the tensor
analysis. Extensive experiments on three real datasets show that HRank can
effectively evaluate the importance of objects and paths together. Moreover,
the constrained meta path shows its potential on mining subtle semantics by
obtaining more accurate ranking results.

cooperative schemes, namely, decode-and-forward (DF) and compress-and-forward

develop upper bounds which are tight in typical operating conditions. Also, we
find the correlation coefficient between source and relay signals which
minimizes the OP when the density of interferers is small. For CF, the
achievable rates are determined by the spatial correlation of the
interferences, and a straightforward analysis isn't possible. To handle this
issue, we show the rate with correlated noises is at most one bit worse than

CF. These results are useful to evaluate the performance and to optimize

  Communications","submitted to IEEE Globecom 2014",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In High Speed Train Communications (HSTC), the most challenging issue is
coping with the extremely fast fading channel. Compared with its static
counterpart, channel estimation on the move consumes excessive energy and
spectrum to achieve similar performance. To address this issue, we exploit the
delay correlation inherent in the linear spatial-temporal structure of
multi-antenna array, based on which the rapid fading channel may be
approximated by a virtual slow-fading channel. Subsequently, error probability
and spectral efficiency are re-examined for this staticized channel. In
particular, we formulate the quantitative tradeoff between the two metrics of
interest, by adjusting the pilot percentage in each frame. Numerical results
verify the good performance of the proposed scheme and elucidate the tradeoff.

parameter $H\simeq 1.0\times 10^{14}\GeV$ during inflation.
  This has two implications for the (single-field) slow-roll inflation
hypothesis. First, the inflaton perturbation must account for much more than
$10\%$ of the curvature perturbation $\zeta$, which barring fine-tuning means
that it accounts for practically all of it. It follows that a curvaton-like
mechanism for generating $\zeta$ requires an alternative to slow roll such as
k-inflation. Second, accepting slow-roll inflation, the excursion of the
inflaton field is at least of order Planck scale. As a result, the flatness of
the inflaton presumably requires a shift symmetry.
  I point out that if such is the case, the resulting potential is likely to
have at least approximately the quadratic form suggested in 1983 by Linde,
which is known to be compatible with the observed $r$ as well as the observed
spectral index $\ns$. The shift symmetry does not require supersymmetry. Also,
the big $H$ may rule out a GUT by restoring the symmetry and producing fatal
cosmic strings. The absence of a GUT would correspond to the absence of
superpartners for the Standard Model particles, which indeed have yet to be
found at the LHC.
  It therefore seems quite possible that the quantum field theory chosen by
Nature is not supersymmetric.

analysis is based on the tip-enhanced Raman scheme, in which a sharp metal tip
located near the sample surface acts as a broadband optical antenna that
transfers the information contained in the spatially-correlated (but
non-propagating) near-field to the far-field. The dependence of the scattered
signal on the tip-sample separation is explored, and the theory predicts that
the signal enhancement depends on the particular symmetry of a vibrational
mode. The model can be applied to extract of the correlation length $L_{\rm c}$
of optical phonons from experimentally recorded near-field Raman measurements.
Although the coherence properties of optical phonons have been broadly explored

ASIP development, integrating application analysis, custom instruction
generation and selection with user-defined compiler intermediate

traditional ASIP design are confronted efficiently; the exploration
infrastructure is liberated from compiler and simulator idiosyncrasies, since
the ASIP designer is empowered with the freedom of specifying the target
architectures of choice and adding new implementations of analyses and custom
instruction generation/selection methods. To illustrate the capabilities of the
YARDstick approach, we present interesting exploration scenarios: quantifying
the effect of machine-dependent compiler optimizations and the selection of the
target architecture in terms of operation set and memory model on custom

demonstrate that because the drift velocity is no longer divergence free, small
variations to the total velocity field drastically affect the evolution of
colloid variance $\sigma^2=\langle C^2 \rangle - \langle C \rangle^2$. A
consequence is that mixing strongly depends on the mutual coherence between
colloid and salt concentration fields, the short time evolution of scalar
variance being governed by a new variance production term $P=- \langle C^2
\nabla \cdot \mathbf{V}_{\rm dp} \rangle/2$ when scalar gradients are not
developed yet so that dissipation is weak. Depending on initial conditions,
mixing is then delayed or enhanced, and it is possible to find examples for
which the two regimes (fast mixing followed by slow mixing) are observed
consecutively when the variance source term reverses its sign. This is indeed
the case for localized patches modeled as gaussian concentration profiles.

the second law of thermodynamics, which is a macroscopic physical
representation of the world, is able to describe irreversible processes in an
isolated system through the change of entropy S larger than 0. It is the
attempt of the present manuscript to bridge the microscopic physical world with
its macrosocpic one with an alternative approach than the statistical mechanics
theory of Gibbs and Boltzmann. It is proposed that time is discrete with
constant step size. Its consequence is the presence of time irreversibility at
the microscopic level if the present force is of complex nature (i.e. not
const). In order to compare this discrete time irreversible mechamics (for
simplicity a classical, single particle in a one dimensional space is selected)
with its classical Newton analog, time reversibility is reintroduced by scaling
the time steps for any given time step n by the variable sn leading to the
Nose-Hoover Lagrangian. The corresponding Nose-Hoover Hamiltonian comprises a
term Ndf *kB*T*ln(sn) (with kB the Boltzmann constant, T the temperature, and
Ndf the number of degrees of freedom) which is defined as the microscopic
entropy Sn at time point n multiplied by T. Upon ensemble averaging this
microscopic entropy Sn in equilibrium for a system which does not have fast
changing forces approximates its macroscopic counterpart known from
thermodynamics. The presented derivation with the resulting analogy between the
ensemble averaged microscopic entropy and its thermodynamic analog suggests
that the original description of the entropy by Boltzmann and Gibbs is just an
ensemble averaging of the time scaling variable sn which is in equilibrium
close to 1, but that the entropy term itself has its root not in statistical
mechanics but rather in the discreteness of time.

Smoluchowski's seminal thought experiment also known as Feynman's ratchet and
pawl system. Our analysis rests on the notion of useful flux, which for a
thermoelectric system is the electrical current and for Feynman's ratchet is
the effective jump frequency. Our approach yields original insight into the
derivation and analysis of the system's properties. In particular we define an
entropy per tooth in analogy with the entropy per carrier or Seebeck
coefficient, and we derive the analogue to Kelvin's second relation for
Feynman's ratchet. Owing to the formal similarity between the heat fluxes
balance equations for a thermoelectric generator (TEG) and those for Feynman's
ratchet, we introduce a distribution parameter that quantifies the amount of
heat that flows through the cold and hot sides of both heat engines. While it
is well established that $\gamma$ = 1/2 for a TEG, it is equal to 1 for
Feynman's ratchet. This implies that no heat may be rejected in the cold
reservoir for the latter case. Further, the analysis of the efficiency at
maximum power shows that the so-called Feynman efficiency corresponds to that
of an exoreversible engine, with $\gamma$ = 1. Then, turning to the nonlinear
regime, we generalize the approach based on the convection picture and
introduce two different types of resistance to distinguish the dynamical
behavior of the considered system from its ability to dissipate energy. We
finally put forth the strong similarity between the original Feynman ratchet

covering the u-jump that indicates the onset of diffusion. It is therefore well
suited to study the effects of diffusion in blue horizontal branch (HB) stars.
We compare observed abundances with predictions from stellar evolution models
calculated with diffusion and from stratified atmospheric models. We verify the
effect of using stratified model spectra to derive atmospheric parameters. In
addition, we investigate the nature of the overluminous blue HB stars around
the u-jump. We defined a new photometric index sz from uvby measurements that
is gravity-sensitive between 8000K and 12000K. Using medium-resolution spectra
and Stroemgren photometry, we determined atmospheric parameters (T_eff, log g)
and abundances for the blue HB stars. We used both homogeneous and stratified
model spectra for our spectroscopic analyses. The atmospheric parameters and
masses of the hot HB stars in NGC288 show a behaviour seen also in other
clusters for temperatures between 9000K and 14000K. Outside this temperature
range, however, they instead follow the results found for such stars in omega
Cen. The abundances derived from our observations are for most elements (except
He and P) within the abundance range expected from evolutionary models that
include the effects of atomic diffusion and assume a surface mixed mass of
10^-7 M0. The abundances predicted by stratified model atmospheres are
generally significantly more extreme than observed, except for Mg. When
effective temperatures, surface gravities, and masses are determined with
stratified model spectra, the hotter stars agree better with canonical
evolutionary predictions. Our results show definite promise towards solving the
long-standing problem of surface gravity and mass discrepancies for hot HB

and astrophysical plasmas. To solve these equations, massively parallel codes
have been developed and run on present-day supercomputers. This paper describes
measures to improve the efficiency of such computations, thereby making them
more realistic. Explicit Runge-Kutta schemes are considered to be well suited
for time-stepping. Although the numerical algorithms are often highly
optimized, performance can still be improved by a suitable choice of the
time-stepping scheme, based on spectral analysis of the underlying operator.
Here, an operator splitting technique is introduced to combine first-order
Runge-Kutta-Chebychev schemes for the collision term with fourth-order schemes
for the remaining terms. In the nonlinear regime, based on the observation of
eigenvalue shifts due to the (generalized) $E\times B$ advection term, an
accurate and robust estimate for the nonlinear timestep is developed. The
presented techniques can reduce simulation times by factors of up to three in
realistic cases. This substantial speedup encourages the use of similar
timestep optimized explicit schemes not only for the gyrokinetic equation, but
also for other applications with comparable properties.

surface or a more complex structure, is intrinsic to a number of systems - from
artificial supported bilayers and vesicles to cellular membranes. In principle,
these interactions can be either discrete and protein mediated, or continuous.
In the latter case, they emerge from ubiquitous intrinsic surface interaction
potentials as well as nature-designed steric contributions of the fluctuating
membrane or from the polymers of the glycocalyx. Despite the fact that these
nonspecific potentials are omnipresent, their description has been a major
challenge from experimental and theoretical points of view. Here we show that a
full understanding of the implications of the continuous interactions can be
achieved only by expanding the standard superposition models commonly used to
treat these types of systems, beyond the usual harmonic level of description.
Supported by this expanded theoretical framework, we present three independent,
yet mutually consistent, experimental approaches to measure the interaction
potential strength and the membrane tension. Upon explicitly taking into
account the nature of shot noise as well as of finite experimental resolution,
excellent agreement with the augmented theory is obtained, which finally
provides a coherent view of the behavior of the membrane in a vicinity of a

temperature. Two related settings are considered. In the first setting the
impurity is injected in the fluid with some initial velocity ${\mathbf v}_0$,
and we are interested in its velocity at infinite time, ${\mathbf v}_\infty$.
We derive a rigorous upper bound on $|{\mathbf v}_0-{\mathbf v}_\infty|$ for
initial velocities smaller than the generalized critical velocity. In the limit
of vanishing impurity-fluid coupling this bound amounts to ${\mathbf
v}_\infty={\mathbf v}_0$ which can be regarded as a rigorous proof of the
Landau criterion of superfluidity. In the case of a finite coupling the
velocity of the impurity can drop, but not to zero; the bound quantifies the
maximal possible drop. In the second setting a small constant force is exerted
upon the impurity. We argue that two distinct dynamical regimes exist --
backscattering oscillations of the impurity velocity and saturation of the
velocity without oscillations. For fluids with $v_{c {\rm L}}=v_s$ (where $v_{c
{\rm L}}$ and $v_s$ are the Landau critical velocity and sound velocity,
respectively) the latter regime is realized. For fluids with $v_{c {\rm L}} <

on the mass of the impurity, a nonequilibrium quantum phase transition
occurring at some critical mass. Our results are equally valid in one, two and
three dimensions.

simulations that minor ions can be nearly fully picked up by intrinsic
Alfv\'en-cyclotron waves observed in the solar wind based on the observed wave
energy density. Both high frequency ion-cyclotron waves and low frequency
Alfv\'en waves play crucial roles in the pickup process. A minor ion can first
gain a high magnetic moment through the resonant wave-particle interaction with
ion-cyclotron waves, and then this ion with a large magnetic moment can be
trapped by magnetic mirror-like field structures in the presence of the
lower-frequency Alfv\'en waves. As a result, the ion is picked up by these
Alfv\'en-cyclotron waves. However, minor ions can only be partially picked up
in the corona due to low wave energy density and low plasma beta. During the
pickup process, minor ions are stochastically heated and accelerated by
Alfv\'en-cyclotron waves so that they are hotter and flow faster than protons.
The compound effect of Alfv\'en waves and ion-cyclotron waves is important on
the heating and acceleration of minor ions. The kinetic properties of minor
ions from simulation results are generally consistent with in situ and remote
features observed in the solar wind and solar corona.

the field of systems biology. This approach needs many realizations for
establishing statistical results on the system under study. It is very
computationnally demanding, and with the advent of large models this burden is
increasing. Hence parallel implementation of SSA are needed to address these
needs.
  At the very heart of the SSA is the selection of the next reaction to occur
at each time step, and to the best of our knowledge all implementations are
based on an inverse transformation method. However, this method involves a
random number of steps to select this next reaction and is poorly amenable to a
parallel implementation.
  Results: Here, we introduce a parallel acceptance-rejection algorithm to
select the K next reactions to occur. This algorithm uses a deterministic
number of steps, a property well suited to a parallel implementation. It is
simple and small, accurate and scalable. We propose a Graphics Processing Unit
(GPU) implementation and validate our algorithm with simulated propensity
distributions and the propensity distribution of a large model of yeast iron
metabolism. We show that our algorithm can handle thousands of selections of
next reaction to occur in parallel on the GPU, paving the way to massive SSA.
  Availability: We present our GPU-AR algorithm that focuses on the very heart
of the SSA. We do not embed our algorithm within a full implementation in order
to stay pedagogical and allows its rapid implementation in existing software.
We hope that it will enable stochastic modelers to implement our algorithm with
the benefits of their own optimizations.

velocity. However, supernova spectra exhibit emission that is generally blue
shifted. While this characteristic has been reported in many supernovae, it is
rarely discussed in any detail. Here we present an analysis of H-alpha
emission-peaks using a dataset of 95 type II supernovae, quantifying their
strength and time evolution. Using a post-explosion time of 30d, we observe a
systematic blueshift of H-alpha emission, with a mean value of -2000 kms-1.
This offset is greatest at early times but vanishes as supernovae become
nebular. Simulations of Dessart et al. (2013) match the observed behaviour,
reproducing both its strength and evolution in time. Such blueshifts are a
fundamental feature of supernova spectra as they are intimately tied to the
density distribution of ejecta, which falls more rapidly than in stellar winds.
This steeper density structure causes line emission/absorption to be much more
confined; it also exacerbates the occultation of the receding part of the
ejecta, biasing line emission to the blue for a distant observer. We conclude
that blue-shifted emission-peak offsets of several thousand kms-1 are a generic
property of observations, confirmed by models, of photospheric-phase type II
supernovae.

pairs. Types 0, I, and II SC/SF are deduced from such triples as: thermally
dressed, relativistic fermionic vortices; spin coupled, dressed, fermionic
vortical pairs (diamagnetic bosons); and spinrevorbitally coupled, dressed
fermionic, vortical pairs (ferromagnetic bosons). All known SC, SF and trends
in critical temperatures (Tc) are thereby explained. The recently observed
SC/SF in nano-graphene systems is explained. The above room temperature SC/SF
is predicted and modeled by transformations of intense thermal boson
populations of heat reservoirs to relativistic mass, weight, spin and magnetism
for further reasoning over compression to electricity, weak phenomena and
strong phenomena for connecting general relativism and quantum mechanics.
