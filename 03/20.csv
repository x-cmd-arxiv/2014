Landau-Zener (LZ) formulas for the probability of nonadiabatic transitions. One
of the formulas requires a diabatic representation of the potential matrix
while the other one depends only on the adiabatic potential energy surfaces.
For each classical trajectory, the nonadiabatic transitions take place only
when the surface gap attains a local minimum. Numerical experiments are
performed with deterministically branching trajectories and with probabilistic
surface hopping. The deterministic and the probabilistic approach confirm the
good agreement of both the LZ probabilities as well the good approximation of
the reference solution computed solving the Schroedinger equation via a grid
based pseudo-spectral method. Visualizations of position expectations and
superimposed surface hopping trajectories with reference position densities
illustrate the effective dynamics of the investigated algorithms.

derive radial velocities and fundamental parameters of about 10^5 Milky Way
stars in the field and in clusters. Observations are carried out with the
multi-object optical spectrograph FLAMES, using simultaneously the medium
resolution (R~20,000) GIRAFFE spectrograph and the high resolution (R~47,000)
UVES spectrograph. In this paper, we describe the methods and the software used
for the data reduction, the derivation of the radial velocities, and the
quality control of the FLAMES-UVES spectra. Data reduction has been performed
using a workflow specifically developed for this project. This workflow runs
the ESO public pipeline optimizing the data reduction for the Gaia-ESO Survey,
performs automatically sky subtraction, barycentric correction and
normalisation, and calculates radial velocities and a first guess of the
rotational velocities. The quality control is performed using the output
parameters from the ESO pipeline, by a visual inspection of the spectra and by
the analysis of the signal-to-noise ratio of the spectra.
  Using the observations of the first 18 months, specifically targets observed
multiple times at different epochs, stars observed with both GIRAFFE and UVES,
and observations of radial velocity standards, we estimated the precision and
the accuracy of the radial velocities. The statistical error on the radial
velocities is sigma~0.4 km s^-1 and is mainly due to uncertainties in the zero
point of the wavelength calibration. However, we found a systematic bias with
respect to the GIRAFFE spectra (~0.9 km s^-1) and to the radial velocities of
the standard stars (~0.5 kms^-1) retrieved from the literature. This bias will
be corrected in the future data releases, when a common zero point for all the
setups and instruments used for the survey will be established.

This effect, present both for a heavy-quark-antiquark or a heavy-quark-gluon

the Dirac gap are of fundamental and practical interest in the field of
topological materials. In topological crystalline insulators (TCIs), a
spontaneously generated Dirac gap was recently observed, which was ascribed to
broken cubic crystal symmetry. However, this structural distortion has not been
directly observed so far, and the microscopic mechanism of Dirac gap opening
via crystal symmetry breaking remains elusive. In this work, we present
scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) measurements of a TCI Pb$_{1-x}$Sn$_x$Se
for a wide range of alloy compositions spanning the topological and
non-topological regimes. STM topographies directly reveal a symmetry-breaking
distortion on the surface, which imparts mass to the otherwise massless Dirac
electrons - a mechanism analogous to the long sought-after Higgs mechanism in
particle physics. Remarkably, our measurements show that the Dirac gap scales
with alloy composition, while the magnitude of the distortion remains nearly
constant. Based on theoretical calculations, we find the Dirac mass is
controlled by the composition-dependent SS penetration depth, which determines
the weight of SS in the distorted region that is confined to the surface.
Finally, we discover the existence of SS in the non-topological regime, which
have the characteristics of gapped, double-branched Dirac fermions.

climate response at decadal time scales are still major factors of uncertainty
for the assessment of the long and short term effects of anthropogenic climate
change. While the relative slow progress on these issues is partly due to the
inherent inaccuracies of numerical climate models, this also hints at the need
for stronger theoretical foundations to the problem of studying climate
sensitivity and performing climate change predictions with numerical models.
Here we demonstrate that it is possible to use Ruelle's response theory to
predict the impact of an arbitrary CO2 forcing scenario on the global surface
temperature of a general circulation model. Response theory puts the concept of
climate sensitivity on firm theoretical grounds, and addresses rigorously the
problem of predictability at different time scales. Conceptually, our results
show that performing climate change experiments with general circulation models
is a well defined problem from a physical and mathematical point of view.
Practically, our results show that considering one single CO2 forcing scenario
is enough to construct operators able to predict the response of climatic
observables to any other CO2 forcing scenario, without the need to perform
additional numerical simulations. We also introduce a general relationship
between climate sensitivity and climate response at different time scales, thus
providing an explicit definition of the inertia of the system at different time
scales. While what we report here refers to the linear response, the general
theory allows for treating nonlinear effects as well. Our results pave the way
for redesigning and interpreting climate change experiments from a radically
new perspective.

of literature employing heap abstractions. Although most studies have addressed
similar concerns, their formulations and formalisms often seem dissimilar and
some times even unrelated. Thus, the insights gained in one description of heap
abstraction may not directly carry over to some other description. This survey
is a result of our quest for a unifying theme in the existing descriptions of
heap abstractions. In particular, our interest lies in the abstractions and not
in the algorithms that construct them.
  In our search of a unified theme, we view a heap abstraction as consisting of
two features: a heap model to represent the heap memory and a summarization
technique for bounding the heap representation. We classify the models as
storeless, store based, and hybrid. We describe various summarization
techniques based on k-limiting, allocation sites, patterns, variables, other
generic instrumentation predicates, and higher-order logics. This approach
allows us to compare the insights of a large number of seemingly dissimilar
heap abstractions and also paves way for creating new abstractions by
mix-and-match of models and summarization techniques.

numerical simulations of molecular clouds. To test this assumption we calculate
the $^{12}$CO/$^{13}$CO ratio self-consistently, taking the isotope selective
photodissociation and the chemical fractionation of CO into account. We model
the coupled chemical, thermal and dynamical evolution and the emergent
$^{13}$CO emission of isolated, starless molecular clouds in various

$\leq$60 per cent error in $^{12}$CO column densities derived from $^{13}$CO.

an important role in alternative quantum theories (AQT), macroscopic quantum
mechanics and gravity-induced decoherence. We show that NSEs for individual
particles do not follow from general relativity (GR) plus quantum field theory
(QFT). Contrary to what is commonly assumed, the NSEs are not the weak-field
(WF), non-relativistic (NR) limit of the semi-classical Einstein equation (SCE)
(this nomenclature is preferred over the `M\/oller-Rosenfeld equation') based
on GR+QFT. The wave-function in the NSEs makes sense only as that for a mean
field describing a system of $N$ particles as $N \rightarrow \infty$, not that
of a single or finite many particles. From GR+QFT the gravitational
self-interaction leads to mass renormalization, not to a non-linear term in the
evolution equations of some AQTs. The WF-NR limit of the gravitational
interaction in GR+QFT involves no dynamics. To see the contrast, we give a
derivation of the equation (i) governing the many-body wave function from
GR+QFT and (ii) for the non-relativistic limit of quantum electrodynamics
(QED). They have the same structure, being linear, and very different from
NSEs. Adding to this our earlier consideration that for gravitational
decoherence the master equations based on GR+QFT lead to decoherence in the
energy basis and not in the position basis, despite some AQTs desiring it for
the `collapse of the wave function', we conclude that the origins and
consequences of NSEs are very different, and should be clearly demarcated from
those of the SCE equation, the only legitimate representative of semiclassical
gravity, based on GR+QFT.

measure the shape of the asteroid, with reaching a space resolution below the

limitating the accuracy of video recorded data. The asteroid profile scans the

stellar ages and abundance patterns of galaxies evolve over time as a function
of stellar mass from 10^{9.6}-10^{11.8} Msun. Galaxy spectra are stacked in
bins of mass and redshift, and modeled over a wavelength range from 4000 A to
5500 A. Full spectrum stellar population synthesis modeling provides estimates
of the age and the abundances of the elements Fe, Mg, C, N, and Ca. We find
negligible evolution in elemental abundances at fixed stellar mass over roughly
7 Gyr of cosmic time. In addition, the increase in stellar ages with time for
massive galaxies is consistent with passive evolution since z = 0.7. Taken
together, these results favor a scenario in which the inner ~ 0.3-3 R_e of
massive quiescent galaxies have been passively evolving over the last half of
cosmic time. Interestingly, the derived stellar ages are considerably younger
than the age of the universe at all epochs, consistent with an equivalent
single-burst star formation epoch of z < 1.5. These young stellar population
ages coupled with the existence of massive quiescent galaxies at z > 1 indicate
the inhomogeneous nature of the z < 0.7 quiescent population. The data also
permit the addition of newly-quenched galaxies at masses below ~10^{10.5} Msun
at z < 0.7. Additionally, we analyze very deep Keck DEIMOS spectra of the two
brightest quiescent galaxies in a cluster at z = 0.83. There is tentative
evidence that these galaxies are older than their counterparts in low-density

significantly influence the morphology of the circum-galactic medium and induce
bipolar features in the distribution of heavy elements. They also affect the

the heavy elements are transferred from the central galaxy to the halo, and
even beyond the virial radius, enough metals are retained by stars to yield a
peak in their metallicity distributions at about $Z_{\odot}$. All our default

that high-magnification events and massive planets are favored by planet

that extremely high-magnification events are less sensitive to planets, which
is possibly because the 10 min sampling of KMTNet is not intensive enough to
capture the subtle anomalies that occur near the peak. This suggests that while
KMTNet observations can be systematically analyzed without reference to any
follow-up data, follow-up observations will be essential in extracting the full
science potential of very high-magnification events. The uniformly high-cadence

accreted onto neutron stars, i.e. Type I X-ray bursts, may affect the accretion
disk. We investigate this by performing a detailed time-resolved spectral
analysis of the superburst from 4U 1636-536 observed in 2001 with the Rossi
X-ray Timing Explorer. Superbursts are attributed to the thermonuclear burning
of carbon, and are approximately 1000 times more energetic than the regular
short Type I bursts. This allows us to study detailed spectra for over 11 ks,
compared to at most 100 s for regular bursts. A feature is present in the
superburst spectra around 6.4 keV that is well fit with an emission line and an
absorption edge, suggestive of reflection of the superburst off the accretion
disk. The line and edge parameters evolve over time: the edge energy decreases
from 9.4 keV at the peak to 8.1 keV in the tail, and both features become
weaker in the tail. This is only the second superburst for which this has been
detected, and shows that this behavior is present even without strong radius
expansion. Furthermore, we find the persistent flux to almost double during the
superburst, and return to the pre-superburst level in the tail. The combination
of reflection features and increased persistent emission indicates that the
superburst had a strong impact on the inner accretion disk, and it emphasizes
that X-ray bursts provide a unique probe of accretion physics.

the geometric model (49 +- 5deg in the K band and 50 +- 11deg in the H band).

163 +- 9deg (K band; 179 +- 17deg in the H band) and 169.3^{+4.2}_{-6.7}deg,

gap might be an indication for a puffed-up inner rim shadowing outer parts of
the disk. The intermediate inclination of ~50deg is consistent with models of

neutron stars is strongly dependent on the mass accretion rate. The burning
behavior is observed to change from Type I X-ray bursts to stable burning, with
oscillatory burning occurring at the transition. Simulations predict the
transition at a ten times higher mass accretion rate than observed. Using
numerical models we investigate how the transition depends on the hydrogen,
helium, and CNO mass fractions of the accreted material, as well as on the
nuclear reaction rates of triple alpha and the hot-CNO breakout reactions
15O(a,g)19Ne and 18Ne(a,p)21Na. For a lower hydrogen content the transition is
at higher accretion rates. Furthermore, most experimentally allowed reaction
rate variations change the transition accretion rate by at most 10%. A factor
ten decrease of the 15O(a,g)19Ne rate, however, produces an increase of the
transition accretion rate of 35%. None of our models reproduce the transition
at the observed rate, and depending on the true 15O(a,g)19Ne reaction rate, the
actual discrepancy may be substantially larger. We find that the width of the
interval of accretion rates with marginally stable burning depends strongly on
both composition and reaction rates. Furthermore, close to the stability
transition, our models predict that X-ray bursts have extended tails where
freshly accreted fuel prolongs nuclear burning.

heliocentric range of ~5 to 30 kpc. Some of these are known (the Monoceros
Ring, the Pisces/Triangulum globular cluster stream), but we also uncover three
well-defined stellar structures that could be, at least partly, responsible for
the so-called Triangulum/Andromeda and Triangulum/Andromeda 2 features. In
particular, we trace a new faint stellar stream located at a heliocentric
distance of ~17 kpc. With a surface brightness of \Sigma_V ~ 32-32.5
mag/arcsec^2, it follows an orbit that is almost parallel to the Galactic plane
north of M31 and has so far eluded surveys of the Milky Way halo as these tend
to steer away from regions dominated by the Galactic disk. Investigating our
follow-up spectroscopic observations of PAndAS, we serendipitously uncover a
radial velocity signature from stars that have colors and magnitudes compatible
with the stream. From the velocity of eight likely member stars, we show that
this stellar structure is dynamically cold, with an unresolved velocity
dispersion that is lower than 7.1 km/s at the 90-percent confidence level.
Along with the width of the stream (300-650 pc), its dynamics points to a
dwarf-galaxy-accretion origin. The numerous stellar structures we can map in
the Milky Way stellar halo between 5 and 30 kpc and their varying morphology is
a testament to the complex nature of the stellar halo at these intermediate
distances.

them. Orbit integration is based on the self-consistent field method in
combination with a time-transformed leapfrog scheme, allowing us to handle
velocity-dependent forces like triaxial dynamical friction. In a first
application, the erosion of globular cluster systems (GCSs) in elliptical
galaxies is investigated. Observations show that massive ellipticals have rich,
radially extended GCSs, while some compact dwarf ellipticals contain no GCs at
all. For several representative examples, spanning the full mass scale of
observed elliptical galaxies, we quantify the influence of radial anisotropy,
galactic density profiles, SMBHs, and dynamical friction on the GC erosion
rate. We find that GC number density profiles are centrally flattened in less
than a Hubble time, naturally explaining observed cored GC distributions. The
erosion rate depends primarily on a galaxy's mass, half-mass radius and radial
anisotropy. The fraction of eroded GCs is nearly 100% in compact, M 32 like
galaxies and lowest in extended and massive galaxies. Finally, we uncover the
existence of a violent tidal disruption dominated phase which is important for
the rapid build-up of halo stars.

post-Friedmann formalism, a post-Newtonian type framework for cosmology, to
derive the full weak-lensing deflection angle valid on non-linear scales for
any metric theory of gravity. We show that the only contributing term that is
quadratic in the first order deflection is the expected Born correction and
lens-lens coupling term. We use this deflection angle to analyse the vector and
tensor contributions to the E- and B- mode cosmic shear power spectra. In our
approach, once the gravitational theory has been specified, the metric
components are related to the matter content in a well-defined manner.
Specifying General Relativity, we write down a complete set of equations for a
GR$+\Lambda$CDM universe for computing all of the possible lensing terms from
Newtonian N-body simulations. We illustrate this with the vector potential and
show that, in a GR$+\Lambda$CDM universe, its contribution to the E-mode is
negligible with respect to that of the conventional Newtonian scalar potential,
even on non-linear scales. Thus, under the standard assumption that Newtonian
N-body simulations give a good approximation of the matter dynamics, we show
that the standard ray tracing approach gives a good description for a

(SGA) with a given number of grooves that are symmetrically distributed with
respect to a central slit. The SGA is nano-patterned on an opaque metallic
film. It is found that a total transmittance of 80% is achieved even for a
single slit when (i) Fabry-Perot like modes are excited inside the slit and
(ii) the effective cross section of the aperture becomes of the order of the
full width at half maximum of the incident beam. A further enhancement of 8% is
produced by the groove array. The optimal geometry for the groove array
consists of a moderate number of grooves ($ \geq 4$) at either side of the
slit, separated by a distance of half the incident wavelength $\lambda$.
Grooves should be deeper (with depth $\geq \lambda/4$) than those typically
reported for plane wave illumination in order to increase their individual
scattering cross section.

detection of B-modes in the polarization of the cosmic microwave background
radiation by the BICEP2 collaboration. In order for the primordial B-mode
signal to be observable by BICEP2, the energy scale of inflation must be high,
$V_{\rm inf} \approx 2 \times 10^{16} \GeV$. Higgs Inflation generally predicts
a small amplitude of tensor perturbations, and therefore it is natural to ask
if Higgs Inflation might accommodate this new measurement. We find the answer
is essentially no, unless one considers either extreme fine tuning, or possibly
adding new beyond the standard model fields, which remove some of the more
attractive features of the original idea. We also explore the possible
importance of a factor that has not previously been explicitly incorporated,
namely the gauge dependence of the effective potential used in calculating
inflationary observables, e.g. $n_S$ and $r$, to see if this might provide
additional wiggle room. Such gauge effects are comparable to effects of Higgs
mass uncertainties and other observables already considered in the analysis,
and therefore they are relevant for constraining models. But, they are
therefore too small to remove the apparent incompatibility between the BICEP2
observation and the predictions of Higgs Inflation.

dependence of this observable is expected to be sensitive to changes in the

cosmic time is encoded in its spin. At $z>2$, supermassive black holes are
thought to grow mostly by merger-driven accretion leading to high spin.
However, it is unknown whether below $z\sim1$ these black holes continue to
grow via coherent accretion or in a chaotic manner, though clear differences
are predicted in their spin evolution. An established method to measure the
spin of black holes is via the study of relativistic reflection features from
the inner accretion disk. Owing to their greater distances, there has hitherto
been no significant detection of relativistic reflection features in a
moderate-redshift quasar. Here, we use archival data together with a new, deep
observation of a gravitationally-lensed quasar at $z=0.658$ to rigorously
detect and study reflection in this moderate-redshift quasar. The level of
relativistic distortion present in this reflection spectrum enables us to
constrain the emission to originate within $\lesssim3$ gravitational radii from
the black hole, implying a spin parameter $a=0.87^{+0.08}_{-0.15} $ at the
$3\sigma$ level of confidence and $a>0.66$ at the $5\sigma$ level. The high
spin found here is indicative of growth via coherent accretion for this black
hole, and suggests that black hole growth between $0.5\lesssim z \lesssim 1$
occurs principally by coherent rather than chaotic accretion episodes.

to Naples in 1938. His fate has never been fully resolved and several articles
have been written that explore the mystery itself. His demise intrigues us
still today because of his seminal work, published the previous year, that
established symmetric solutions to the Dirac equation that describe a fermionic
particle that is its own anti-particle. This work has long had a significant
impact in neutrino physics, where this fundamental question regarding the
particle remains unanswered. But the formalism he developed has found many uses
as there are now a number of candidate spin-1/2 neutral particles that may be
truly neutral with no quantum number to distinguish them from their
anti-particles. If such particles exist, they will influence many areas of
nuclear and particle physics. Most notably the process of neutrinoless double
beta decay can only exist if neutrinos are massive Majorana particles. Hence,
many efforts to search for this process are underway. Majorana's influence
doesn't stop with particle physics, however, even though that was his original
consideration. The equations he derived also arise in solid state physics where
they describe electronic states in materials with superconducting order. Of
special interest here is the class of solutions of the Majorana equation in one
and two spatial dimensions at exactly zero energy. These Majorana zero modes
are endowed with some remarkable physical properties that may lead to advances
in quantum computing and, in fact, there is evidence that they have been
experimentally observed. This review first summarizes the basics of Majorana's
theory and its implications. It then provides an overview of the rich
experimental programs trying to find a fermion that is its own anti-particle in
nuclear, particle, and solid state physics.

explosions, but the form it takes differs significantly among models. The
spatial distribution of radioactive 44Ti, synthesized in an exploding star near
the boundary between material falling back onto the collapsing core and that
ejected into the surrounding medium, directly probes the explosion asymmetries.
CassiopeiaA is a young, nearby, core-collapse remnant from which 44Ti emission
has previously been detected but not imaged. Asymmetries in the explosion have
been indirectly inferred from a high ratio of observed 44Ti emission to
estimated 56Ni emission, from optical light echoes, and from jet-like features
seen in the X-ray and optical ejecta. Here we report spatial maps and spectral
properties of the 44Ti in Cassiopeia A. This may explain the unexpected lack of
correlation between the 44Ti and iron X-ray emission, the latter being visible
only in shock-heated material. The observed spatial distribution rules out
symmetric explosions even with a high level of convective mixing, as well as
highly asymmetric bipolar explosions resulting from a fast-rotating progenitor.
Instead, these observations provide strong evidence for the development of
low-mode convective instabilities in core-collapse supernovae.

cluster light (ICL) properties, estimating its contribution to the fraction of
baryons in stars, f*, and understanding possible systematics/bias using
different ICL detection techniques. We developed an automated method, GALtoICL,
based on the software GALAPAGOS to obtain a refined version of typical BCG+ICL
maps. We applied this method to our test case MACS J1206.2-0847, a massive
cluster located at z=0.44, that is part of the CLASH sample. Using deep
multi-band SUBARU images, we extracted the surface brightness (SB) profile of
the BCG+ICL and we studied the ICL morphology, color, and contribution to f*
out to R500. We repeated the same analysis using a different definition of the
ICL, SBlimit method, i.e. a SB cut-off level, to compare the results. The most
peculiar feature of the ICL in MACS1206 is its asymmetric radial distribution,
with an excess in the SE direction and extending towards the 2nd brightest
cluster galaxy which is a Post Starburst galaxy. This suggests an interaction
between the BCG and this galaxy that dates back to t <= 1.5 Gyr. The BCG+ICL
stellar content is 8% of M_(*,500) and the (de-) projected baryon fraction in
stars is f*=0.0177 (0.0116), in excellent agreement with recent results. The
SBlimit method provides systematically higher ICL fractions and this effect is
larger at lower SB limits. This is due to the light from the outer envelopes of
member galaxies that contaminate the ICL. Though more time consuming, the
GALtoICL method provides safer ICL detections that are almost free of this
contamination. This is one of the few ICL study at redshift z > 0.3. At
completion, the CLASH/VLT program will allow us to extend this analysis to a
statistically significant cluster sample spanning a wide redshift range:
0.2<z<0.6.

ranging from nuclear magnetic resonance to chemical synthesis. A detailed
understanding of this stochastic evolution is essential for the development of

continuous weak measurement and driven unitary evolution. By tracking
individual trajectories that evolve between an arbitrary choice of initial and

damping coefficient which varies until reaching a finite final value. The sizes
of the corresponding basins of attraction are found to depend strongly on the
full evolution of the dissipation. In order to predict the behaviour of the
system, it is essential to understand how the sizes of the basins of attraction
for constant dissipation depend on the damping coefficient. For values of the
parameters in the perturbation regime, we characterise analytically the
conditions under which the attractors exist and study numerically how the sizes
of their basins of attraction depend on the damping coefficient. Away from the
perturbation regime, a numerical study of the attractors and the corresponding
basins of attraction for different constant values of the damping coefficient
produces a much more involved scenario: changing the magnitude of the
dissipation causes some attractors to disappear either leaving no trace or
producing new attractors by bifurcation, such as period doubling and
saddle-node bifurcation. For an initially non-constant damping coefficient,
both increasing and decreasing to some finite final value, we numerically
observe that, when the damping coefficient varies slowly from a finite initial
value to a different final value, without changing the set of attractors, the
slower the variation the closer the sizes of the basins of attraction are to
those they have for constant damping coefficient fixed at the initial value. If
during the variation of the damping coefficient attractors appear or disappear,
remarkable additional phenomena may occur. For instance, a fixed point
asymptotically may attract the entire phase space, up to a zero measure set,
even though no attractor with such a property exists for any value of the
damping coefficient between the extreme values.

of the Self-Feeding Process (SFP) to generate inter-event times between

at most two parameters and is able to generate inter-event times with all the
universal properties we observed in the data. We show the potential application

generalizations of the two-party zero-error channel-coding problem, where a
sender and a receiver want to perfectly communicate messages through a one-way
classical noisy channel. If the two parties are allowed to share entanglement,
there are several positive results that show the existence of channels for
which they can communicate strictly more than what they could do with classical
resources. In the first task, one sender wants to communicate a common message
to multiple receivers. We show that if the number of receivers is greater than
a certain threshold then entanglement does not allow for an improvement in the
communication for any finite number of uses of the channel. On the other hand,
when the number of receivers is fixed, we exhibit a class of channels for which
entanglement gives an advantage. The second problem we consider features
multiple collaborating senders and one receiver. Classically, cooperation among
the senders might allow them to communicate on average more messages than the
sum of their individual possibilities. We show that whenever a channel allows
single-sender entanglement-assisted advantage, then the gain extends also to
the multi-sender case. Furthermore, we show that entanglement allows for a
peculiar amplification of information which cannot happen classically, for a
fixed number of uses of a channel with multiple senders.

chunks) in speeding the I/O performance of storage clouds. However, a
comprehensive approach that considers all three dimensions together to achieve
the best throughput-delay trade-off curve had been lacking. This paper presents
the first set of solutions that can pick the best combination of coding rate
and object chunking/slicing options as the load dynamically changes. Our
specific contributions are as follows: (1) We establish via measurement that
combining variable coding rate and chunking is mostly feasible over a popular
public cloud. (2) We relate the delay optimal values for chunking level and
code rate to the queue backlogs via an approximate queueing analysis. (3) Based
on this analysis, we propose TOFEC that adapts the chunking level and coding
rate against the queue backlogs. Our trace-driven simulation results show that
TOFEC's adaptation mechanism converges to an appropriate code that provides the
optimal throughput-delay trade-off without reducing system capacity. Compared
to a non-adaptive strategy optimized for throughput, TOFEC delivers $2.5\times$
lower latency under light workloads; compared to a non-adaptive strategy
optimized for latency, TOFEC can scale to support over $3\times$ as many
requests. (4) We propose a simpler greedy solution that performs on a par with
TOFEC in average delay performance, but exhibits significantly more performance

In addition, this kernel implements a run-time over-the-air updating mechanism
and provides a security policy to avoid the attacks and ensure the reliable

results show this kernel is task-oriented and resource-aware and can be used

find that clump mass and column density show no significant population
difference, and that kinetic temperature is the best parameter to distinguish
between the gravitationally bound state of each clump. The kinetic temperature
was the only parameter found to have a significantly low probability of being
drawn from the same population. This suggests that clump radii does not have a
large effect on the temperature of a clump, so clumps of similar radii may have
different internal heating mechanisms. We also find that while the IR-bright
clumps have a higher median virial mass, both samples have a similar range for
both virial mass and FWHM. There are 87 per cent (40 of 46) of the clumps with

methodology for problems involving well-spaced targets, but it is rarely

addresses these difficulties using random finite sets (RFSs) and variational
inference, deriving a highly tractable, approximate method for obtaining the
multi-Bernoulli distribution that minimises the set Kullback-Leibler (KL)
divergence from the true posterior, working within the RFS framework to
incorporate uncertainty in target existence. The derivation is interpreted as
an application of expectation-maximisation (EM), where the missing data is the
correspondence of Bernoulli components (i.e., tracks) under each data
association hypothesis. The missing data is shown to play an identical role to
the selection of an ordered distribution in the same ordered family in the set
JPDA algorithm. Subsequently, a special case of the proposed method is utilised
to provide an efficient approximation of the minimum mean optimal sub-pattern
assignment estimator. The performance of the proposed methods is demonstrated
in challenging scenarios in which up to twenty targets come into close

role in solar dynamics on decadal timescales. In particular, quantifying
meridional motions is a critical ingredient for understanding the solar cycle
and the transport of magnetic flux. Because the signal of such features can be
quite small in deep solar layers and be buried in systematics or noise, the
true meridional velocity profile has remained elusive. We perform time-distance
helioseismology measurements on several years worth of GONG Doppler data. A
spherical harmonic decomposition technique is applied to a subset of acoustic
modes to measure travel-time differences to try to obtain signatures of
meridional flows throughout the solar convection zone. Center-to-limb
systematics are taken into account in an intuitive, yet ad hoc manner.
Travel-time differences near the surface that are consistent with a poleward
flow in each hemisphere and are similar to previous work are measured.
Additionally, measurements in deep layers near the base of the convection zone
suggest a possible equatorward flow, as well as partial evidence of a sign
change in the travel-time differences at mid-convection zone depths. This
analysis on an independent data set using different measurement techniques
strengthens recent conclusions that the convection zone may have multiple
""cells"" of meridional flow. The results may challenge the common understanding
of one large conveyor belt operating in the solar convection zone. Further work
with helioseismic inversions and a careful study of systematic effects are
needed before firm conclusions of these large-scale flow structures can be

for scalar dark matter the viable options are one scalar-type coupling to

prior knowledge for integrative analysis with RNA-seq data. We introduce a
Network-based method for RNA-Seq-based Transcript Quantification (Net-RSTQ) to
integrate protein domain-domain interaction network with short read alignments
for transcript abundance estimation. Based on our observation that the
abundances of the neighboring isoforms by domain-domain interactions in the
network are positively correlated, Net-RSTQ models the expression of the
neighboring transcripts as Dirichlet priors on the likelihood of the observed
read alignments against the transcripts in one gene. The transcript abundances
of all the genes are then jointly estimated with alternating optimization of
multiple EM problems. In simulation Net-RSTQ effectively improved isoform
transcript quantifications when isoform co-expressions correlate with their
interactions. qRT-PCR results on 25 multi-isoform genes in a stem cell line, an
ovarian cancer cell line, and a breast cancer cell line also showed that
Net-RSTQ estimated more consistent isoform proportions with RNA-Seq data. In
the experiments on the RNA-Seq data in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), the
transcript abundances estimated by Net-RSTQ are more informative for patient
sample classification of ovarian cancer, breast cancer and lung cancer. All

continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC) and work well for small state spaces. The
computations slow down considerably for larger state spaces (e.g. space of
codons), because current methodology relies on exponentiating CTMC
infinitesimal rate matrices -- an operation whose computational complexity
grows as the size of the CTMC state space cubed. In this work, we introduce a
new approach, based on a CTMC technique called uniformization, that does not
use matrix exponentiation for phylogenetic stochastic mapping. Our method is
based on a new Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm that targets the
distribution of trait histories conditional on the trait data observed at the
tips of the tree. The computational complexity of our MCMC method grows as the
size of the CTMC state space squared. Moreover, in contrast to competing matrix
exponentiation methods, if the rate matrix is sparse, we can leverage this
sparsity and increase the computational efficiency of our algorithm further.
Using simulated data, we illustrate advantages of our MCMC algorithm and
investigate how large the state space needs to be for our method to outperform
matrix exponentiation approaches. We show that even on the moderately large
state space of codons our MCMC method can be significantly faster than
currently used matrix exponentiation methods.

network virtualization is how to map multiple virtual networks onto specific
nodes and links in the shared substrate network, known as virtual network
embedding problem. Due to its NPhardness, many heuristic approaches have been
proposed. In this thesis, we propose hybrid VN embedding algorithms that map
multiple VN requests with node and link constraints with K-core decomposition
using path splitting. Based on network pruning, a virtual network is decomposed
to core network and edge network. The mapping process is divided into two
phases: core network mapping and edge network mapping. Path splitting enables
better resource utilization by allowing the substrate to accept more VN
requests. It splits the available bandwidth of the path into small bandwidth to
satisfy the resource constraints. The proposed algorithm improves the
performance of the algorithm by splitting the path into small bandwidth. Due to
path splitting proposed algorithm will accept many virtual network requests
that will increase the revenue and acceptance ratio of the algorithm.

electronic transport can stay very low, with the longitudinal resistivity lower

function. Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging (dMRI) is the only noninvasive
technique which can detect in vivo anisotropies in the 3-dimensional diffusion
of water molecules, which correspond to nervous fibers in the living brain. In
this process, spectral data from the displacement distribution of water
molecules is collected by a magnetic resonance scanner. From the statistical
point of view, inverting the Fourier transform from such sparse and noisy
spectral measurements leads to a non-linear regression problem. Diffusion
tensor imaging (DTI) is the simplest modeling approach postulating a Gaussian
displacement distribution at each volume element (voxel). Typically the
inference is based on a linearized log-normal regression model that can fit the
spectral data at low frequencies. However such approximation fails to fit the
high frequency measurements which contain information about the details of the
displacement distribution but have a low signal to noise ratio. In this paper,
we directly work with the Rice noise model and cover the full range of
$b$-values. Using data augmentation to represent the likelihood, we reduce the
non-linear regression problem to the framework of generalized linear models.
Then we construct a Bayesian hierarchical model in order to perform
simultaneously estimation and regularization of the tensor field. Finally the
Bayesian paradigm is implemented by using Markov chain Monte Carlo.

posterior for the primordial non-Gaussianity parameters $f_\text{NL}$ and
$g_\text{NL}$, which in general depend on specific parameters of inflation and
reheating models, and enables to discriminate among the still viable inflation
models. To keep analyticity as far as possible to dispense with numerically
expensive sampling techniques a saddle-point approximation is introduced, whose
precision is validated for a numerical toy example. The mathematical
formulation is done in a generic way so that the approach remains applicable to
cosmic microwave background data as well as to large scale structure data.
Additionally, we review a few currently interesting inflation models and
present numerical toy examples thereof in two and three dimensions to
demonstrate the efficiency of the higher-order statistics method. A second
quantity of interest is the primordial power spectrum. Here, we present two
Bayesian methods to infer it from observational data, the so called critical
filter and an extension thereof with smoothness prior, both allowing for a
non-parametric spectrum reconstruction. These methods are able to reconstruct
the spectra of the observed perturbations and the primordial ones of curvature
perturbation even in case of non-Gaussianity and partial sky coverage. We argue
that observables like $T-$ and $B-$modes permit to measure both spectra. This
also allows to infer the level of non-Gaussianity generated since inflation.

entrenched with violent forms of competition and are bound to stagnation.
Nonetheless, few are the attempts to uncover the patterns followed by criminal
organisations in their business ventures. The reason lays mostly in the poor
availability of data on criminal activity, or in the highly risky task of
gather it.
  This paper partially fills this gap thanks to access to information about the

extent of criminal infiltration into the legitimate private economy of the
case-study using network techniques. The research demonstrates that sectors
with a high degree of centrality and comprising fewer firms are the most

the study of BALDA solutions close to a Mott phase or in the Coulomb blockade
regime. Here we propose a numerical approach which, differently from previous
works, does not introduce ad hoc parameters to smear out the singularity. Our
results are relevant for all lattice models where BALDA is applied ranging from
Kondo systems to harmonically trapped Hubbard fermions. As an example we apply
the method to the study of a one-dimensional lattice model with Hubbard
interaction and a staggered potential which can be driven from an ionic to a
Mott insulating state. In the Mott regime the presence of a ""vacuum"" allows us
to calculate the different contribution to the gap and to highlight an
ultranonlocality of BALDA.

Two initial disk models are examined with the same mass distribution and total
initial water content, but with different distributions of water content. We
compare the accretion rates and final water mass fraction of the planets that

giant planets were water-rich, showing that giant planet companions are not
required to deliver volatiles to terrestrial planets in the habitable zone. In
contrast, an outer planet at least several times the mass of Earth may be
needed to clear distant regions from debris truncating the epoch of frequent
large impacts. Observations of exoplanets from radial velocity surveys suggest
that outer Jupiter-like planets may be scarce, therefore the results presented

general multiuser X channel, is studied. In the Gaussian many-to-one X channel,
communication links exist between all transmitters and one of the receivers,
along with a communication link between each transmitter and its corresponding
receiver. As per the X channel assumption, transmission of messages is allowed
on all the links of the channel. This communication model is different from the
corresponding many-to-one interference channel (IC). Transmission strategies
which involve using Gaussian codebooks and treating interference from a subset
of transmitters as noise are formulated for the above channel. Sum-rate is used
as the criterion of optimality for evaluating the strategies. Initially, a $3
\times 3$ many-to-one X channel is considered and three transmission strategies
are analyzed. The first two strategies are shown to achieve sum-rate capacity
under certain channel conditions. For the third strategy, a sum-rate outer
bound is derived and the gap between the outer bound and the achieved rate is
characterized. These results are later extended to the $K \times K$ case. Next,
a region in which the many-to-one X channel can be operated as a many-to-one IC
without loss of sum-rate is identified. Further, in the above region, it is
shown that using Gaussian codebooks and treating interference as noise achieves
a rate point that is within $K/2 -1$ bits from the sum-rate capacity.
Subsequently, some implications of the above results to the Gaussian
many-to-one IC are discussed. Transmission strategies for the many-to-one IC
are formulated and channel conditions under which the strategies achieve
sum-rate capacity are obtained. A region where the sum-rate capacity can be
characterized to within $K/2-1$ bits is also identified.

Bibliometric data of scientific publications showed a continuous bipolar

of the underlying dictionary for a given set of training samples. While ideally
this would be achieved by optimizing the expectation of the factors over the
underlying distribution of the training data, in practice the necessary
information about the distribution is not available. Therefore, in real world
applications it is achieved by minimizing an empirical average over the
available samples. The main goal of this paper is to provide a sample
complexity estimate that controls to what extent the empirical average deviates
from the cost function. This estimate then provides a suitable estimate to the
accuracy of the representation of the learned dictionary. The presented
approach exemplifies the general results proposed by the authors in Sample
Complexity of Dictionary Learning and other Matrix Factorizations, Gribonval et

and transport characteristics. As these are generally modelled based on the
free-electron classical theory, the free-electron number is a key parameter.
However, this parameter remains unclearly defined and dependencies on the
electronic temperature are not considered. Here, from first-principles
calculations, density of states are obtained with respect to electronic
temperatures varying from 10^-2 to 10^5 K within a cold lattice. Based on the
concept of localized or delocalized electronic states, temperature dependent
free-electron numbers are evaluated for a series of metals covering a large
range of electronic configurations. With the increase of the electronic
temperature we observe strong adjustments of the electronic structures of
transition metals. These are related to variations of electronic occupation in
localized d bands, via change in electronic screening and electron-ion
effective potential. The electronic temperature dependence of nonequilibrium
density of states has consequences on electronic chemical potentials,
free-electron numbers, electronic heat capacities, and electronic pressures.
Thus electronic thermodynamic properties are computed and discussed, serving as
a base to derive energetic and transport properties allowing the description of
excitation and relaxation phenomena caused by rapid laser action.

Comparison between model output and tweet information allowed the calibration
of model parameters to optimize the fit between flows to museums inferred from

conclude that volunteered geographic information from social media sites have
great potential for informing geographical models of behavior, especially if

physics of multiferroicity which has not yet well understood, noting that
multiferroicity is receiving attentions for promising application potentials.
DyMn2O5 is a representative member of this family. The ferroelectric
polarization in DyMn2O5 is claimed to have two anti-parallel components: one
(PDM) from the symmetric exchange striction between the Dy3+-Mn4+ interactions
and the other (PMM) from the symmetric exchange striction between the Mn3+-Mn4+
interactions. We investigate the evolutions of the two components upon a
partial substitution of Mn3+ by nonmagnetic Al3+ in order to tailor the Mn-Mn
interactions and then to modulate component PMM in DyMn2-x/2Alx/2O5. It is
revealed that the ferroelectric polarization can be successfully reversed by
the Al-substitution via substantially suppressing the Mn3+-Mn4+ interactions
and thus the PMM. The Dy3+-Mn4+ interactions and the polarization component PDM
can sustain against the substitution until a level as high as x=0.2. In
addition, the independent Dy spin ordering is shifted remarkably down to an
extremely low temperature due to the Al3+ substitution. The present work not
only confirms the existence of the two anti-parallel polarization components
but also unveils the possibility of tailoring them independently.

many-body interactions among electrons and is expected to play a critical role
in nanoelectronics. One of many tantalizing recent physical revelations about
quantum capacitance is that it can posses a negative value, hence allowing for
the possibility of enhancing the overall capacitance in some particular
material systems beyond the scaling predicted by classical electrostatics.
Using detailed quantum mechanical simulations, we find an intriguing result
that mechanical strains can tune both signs and values of quantum capacitance.
We use a small coaxially-gated carbon nanotube as a paradigmatical capacitor
system and show that, for the range of mechanical strain considered, quantum
capacitance can be adjusted from very large positive to very large negative
values (in the order of plus/minus hundreds of attofarads), compared to the
corresponding classical geometric value (0.31035 aF). We elucidate the
mechanisms underpinning the switching of the sign of quantum capacitance due to
strain. This finding opens novel avenues in designing quantum capacitance for
applications in nanosensors, energy storage, and nanoelectronics.

the dimensional reduction of biomedical data, interpretation of PCA results
remains daunting. Most existing methods attempt to explain each principal
component (PC) in terms of a small number of variables by generating
approximate PCs with few non-zero loadings. Although useful when just a few
variables dominate the population PCs, these methods are often inadequate for
characterizing the PCs of high-dimensional genomic data. For genomic data,
reproducible and biologically meaningful PC interpretation requires methods
based on the combined signal of functionally related sets of genes. While gene
set testing methods have been widely used in supervised settings to quantify
the association of groups of genes with clinical outcomes, these methods have
seen only limited application for testing the enrichment of gene sets relative
to sample PCs. Results: We describe a novel approach, principal component gene
set enrichment (PCGSE), for computing the statistical association between gene
sets and the PCs of genomic data. The PCGSE method performs a two-stage
competitive gene set test using the correlation between each gene and each PC
as the gene-level test statistic with flexible choice of both the gene set test
statistic and the method used to compute the null distribution of the gene set
statistic. Using simulated data with simulated gene sets and real gene
expression data with curated gene sets, we demonstrate that biologically
meaningful and computationally efficient results can be obtained from a simple
parametric version of the PCGSE method that performs a correlation-adjusted
two-sample t-test between the gene-level test statistics for gene set members
and genes not in the set. Availability:

jittering jets launched by an intermittent accretion disk formed by accreted

explosion and circumstellar material left behind by their progenitor. However,
the complexity of the interaction between supernova ejecta and ambient medium
often blurs this information, and it is not uncommon for the basic progenitor
type (Ia or core-collapse) of well-studied remnants to remain uncertain. Here
we present a powerful new observational diagnostic to discriminate between
progenitor types and constrain the ambient medium density of SNRs solely using
Fe K-shell X-ray emission. We analyze all extant Suzaku observations of SNRs
and detect Fe K alpha emission from 23 young or middle-aged remnants, including
five first detections (IC 443, G292.0+1.8, G337.2-0.7, N49, and N63A). The Fe K
alpha centroids clearly separate progenitor types, with the Fe-rich ejecta in
Type Ia remnants being significantly less ionized than in core-collapse SNRs.
Within each progenitor group, the Fe K alpha luminosity and centroid are well
correlated, with more luminous objects having more highly ionized Fe. Our
results indicate that there is a strong connection between explosion type and
ambient medium density, and suggest that Type Ia supernova progenitors do not
substantially modify their surroundings at radii of up to several parsecs. We
also detect a K-shell radiative recombination continuum of Fe in W49B and IC
443, implying a strong circumstellar interaction in the early evolutionary
phases of these core-collapse remnants.

evidence synergetic effects.
  In cases when the number of samples is low, thus making the fully conditioned
approach unfeasible, we show that partially conditioned Granger causality is an
effective approach if the set of conditioning variables is properly chosen. We
consider here two different strategies (based either on informational content
for the candidate driver or on selecting the variables with highest pairwise
influences) for partially conditioned Granger causality and show that depending
on the data structure either one or the other might be valid. On the other
hand, we observe that fully conditioned approaches do not work well in presence
of redundancy, thus suggesting the strategy of separating the pairwise links in
two subsets: those corresponding to indirect connections of the fully
conditioned Granger causality (which should thus be excluded) and links that
can be ascribed to redundancy effects and, together with the results from the
fully connected approach, provide a better description of the causality pattern
in presence of redundancy. We finally apply these methods to two different real
datasets. First, analyzing electrophysiological data from an epileptic brain,
we show that synergetic effects are dominant just before seizure occurrences.
Second, our analysis applied to gene expression time series from HeLa culture
shows that the underlying regulatory networks are characterized by both

on the relation between the angular momentum quantum number, $\ell$, and $D$.
When $\ell$ is a (non-negative) integer multiple of $D-3$, i.e $\ell=p(D-3)$,
we find an analytical quasinormal frequency formula adding a purely imaginary
correction to the AdS normal frequencies. This is the case for all $\ell$ modes
in $D=4$. For general $D$ there are two more cases: i) when $\ell$ obeys
$\ell=(p+\frac{1}{2})(D-3)$, which can occur for odd $D$, we observe that the
matching method fails, since the near and far region solutions have different
functional dependences; ii) for all other cases, the analytical quasinormal
frequency formula gives a complex correction to the AdS normal frequencies.
Secondly, we perform a numerical calculation which confirms the analytical
formulas obtained with the matching method and allows us to explore the case
where that method failed. In the latter case, as in the former, we verify that
all $\ell$ modes for all $D$ may become superradiant, which contradicts a

density perturbations in the CMB reported by the BICEP2 Collaboration, if
confirmed, provides strong evidence for Inflation at the GUT scale. While the
Inflationary signal remains the best motivated source, a large value of $r$
alone would still allow for the possibility that a comparable gravitational
wave background might result from a self ordering scalar field (SOSF)
transition that takes place later at somewhat lower energy. We find that even
without detailed considerations of the predicted BICEP signature of such a
transition, simple existing limits on the isocurvature contribution to CMB
anisotropies would definitively rule out a contribution of more than $5\%$ to
$r \approx 0.2$,. We also present a general relation for the allowed fractional
SOSF contribution to $r$ as a function of the ultimate measured value of $r$.
These results point strongly not only to an inflationary origin of the BICEP2
signal, if confirmed, but also to the fact that if the GUT scale is of order
$10^{16} GeV$ then either the GUT transition happens before Inflation or the
Inflationary transition and the GUT transition must be one and the same.

diameter $D$. We study the time complexity of approximating {\em weighted}
(undirected) shortest paths on distributed networks with a $O(\log n)$ {\em
bandwidth restriction} on edges (the standard synchronous \congest model). The
question whether approximation algorithms help speed up the shortest paths
(more precisely distance computation) was raised since at least 2004 by Elkin
(SIGACT News 2004). The unweighted case of this problem is well-understood
while its weighted counterpart is fundamental problem in the area of
distributed approximation algorithms and remains widely open. We present new
algorithms for computing both single-source shortest paths (\sssp) and
all-pairs shortest paths (\apsp) in the weighted case.
  Our main result is an algorithm for \sssp. Previous results are the classic
$O(n)$-time Bellman-Ford algorithm and an $\tilde O(n^{1/2+1/2k}+D)$-time
$(8k\lceil \log (k+1) \rceil -1)$-approximation algorithm, for any integer
$k\geq 1$, which follows from the result of Lenzen and Patt-Shamir (STOC 2013).
(Note that Lenzen and Patt-Shamir in fact solve a harder problem, and we use
$\tilde O(\cdot)$ to hide the $O(\poly\log n)$ term.) We present an $\tilde
O(n^{1/2}D^{1/4}+D)$-time $(1+o(1))$-approximation algorithm for \sssp. This
algorithm is {\em sublinear-time} as long as $D$ is sublinear, thus yielding a
sublinear-time algorithm with almost optimal solution. When $D$ is small, our
running time matches the lower bound of $\tilde \Omega(n^{1/2}+D)$ by Das Sarma
et al. (SICOMP 2012), which holds even when $D=\Theta(\log n)$, up to a
$\poly\log n$ factor.

Majorana fermions, in which all environmental degrees of freedom (leads and
electromagnetic modes) are encapsulated in a single fermionic bath. General
transport equations for this system are then derived in terms of the Majorana
T-matrix. Perturbative treatment of the Majorana interaction term yields the
appearance of a marginal, linear dependence of the conductance on temperature
when the system is tuned to its quantum critical point, in agreement with
recent experimental observations. We investigate in detail the different
crossovers involved in the problem, and analyze the role of the interaction
terms in the transport scaling functions. In particular, we show that single

crucial for portfolio management (portfolio composition, hedging, alternative
definition of risk, etc.). This lack of any characteristic scale and such
elaborated behaviours find their origin in the theory of complex systems. There
are several mechanisms which generate scale invariance but maximum entropy
models are able to explain both scale invariance and collective behaviours. The
study of the structure and collective modes of financial markets attracts more
and more attention. It has been shown that some agent based models are able to
reproduce some stylized facts. Despite their partial success, there is still
the problem of rules design. In this work, we used a statistical inverse
approach to model the structure and co-movements in financial markets. Inverse
models restrict the number of assumptions. We found that a pairwise maximum
entropy model is consistent with the data and is able to describe the complex
structure of financial systems. We considered the existence of a critical state
which is linked to how the market processes information, how it responds to
exogenous inputs and how its structure changes. The considered data sets did
not reveal a persistent critical state but rather oscillations between order
and disorder. In this framework, we also showed that the collective modes are
mostly dominated by pairwise co-movements and that univariate models are not
good candidates to model crashes. The analysis also suggests a genuine adaptive
process since both the maximum variance of the log-likelihood and the accuracy
of the predictive scheme vary through time. This approach may provide some clue
to crash precursors and may provide highlights on how a shock spreads in a
financial network and if it will lead to a crash. The natural continuation of
the present work could be the study of such a mechanism.

are ideal laboratories to study the distribution of the most abundant chemical
elements heavier than hydrogen and helium and the history of their production.
The cluster environment allows us to study the element abundances not only
inside the galaxies, but also in the intergalactic space, the intracluster
medium. Since the intracluster medium is heated to temperatures of several ten
Million degrees, we can study the chemical composition of this medium through
X-ray spectroscopy. Up to 13 heavy elements have been detected by X-ray
spectroscopy so far. The element most easily detected in the X-ray spectra is
iron. In massive galaxy clusters we find a larger mass of heavy elements in the
intracluster medium than in the galaxies. The consideration of the intracluster
medium is therefore vital for an understanding of the complete history of
nucleosynthesis of the heavy elements. The observed abundances for all elements
heavier than nitrogen can roughly be modeled by using two types of sources:
core collapse supernovae and supernovae type Ia. So called cool-core galaxy
clusters show a larger heavy element abundance in the cluster center which
seems to be enriched primarily by products of supernovae of type Ia. The
evidence for observations of an evolution of the heavy element abundance with
redshift has still a moderate significance.

some theory for them. Recall that the codomain of a
$(\sigma,\varepsilon)$-quadratic form is the group $\overline{K} :=
K/K_{\sigma,\varepsilon}$, where $K$ is the underlying division ring of the
vector space on which the form is defined and $K_{\sigma,\varepsilon} :=
\{t-t^\sigma\varepsilon\}_{t\in K}$. Generalized pseudo-quadratic forms are
defined in the same way as $(\sigma,\varepsilon)$-quadratic forms but for
replacing $\overline{K}$ with a quotient $\overline{K}/\overline{R}$ for a
subgroup $\overline{R}$ of $\overline{K}$ such that
$\lambda^\sigma\overline{R}\lambda = \overline{R}$ for any $\lambda\in K$. In
particular, every non-trivial generalized pseudo-quadratic form admits a unique
sesquilinearization, characterized by the same property as the
sesquilinearization of a pseudo-quadratic form. Moreover, if $q:V\rightarrow
\overline{K}/\overline{R}$ is a non-trivial generalized pseudo-quadratic form
and $f:V\times V\rightarrow K$ is its sesquilinarization, the points and the
lines of $\mathrm{PG}(V)$ where $q$ vanishes form a subspace $S_q$ of the polar
space $S_f$ associated to $f$. After a discussion of quotients and covers of
generalized pseudo-quadratic forms we prove the following: let $e:S\rightarrow
\mathrm{PG}(V)$ be a projective embedding of a non-degenerate polar space $S$
of rank at least $2$; then $e(S)$ is either the polar space $S_q$ associated to
a generalized pseudo-quadratic form $q$ or the polar space $S_f$ associated to
an alternating form $f$. By exploiting this theorem we also obtain an
elementary proof of the following well known fact: an embedding $e$ as above is
dominant if and only if either $e(S) = S_q$ for a pseudo-quadratic form $q$ or
$\mathrm{char}(K)\neq 2$ and $e(S) = S_f$ for an alternating form $f$.

theory. However the clinical course following SCT appears to demonstrate many
characteristics of dynamical systems, especially when outcomes are considered
in the context of immune reconstitution. Dynamical systems tend to evolve over
time according to mathematically determined rules. Characteristically, the
future states of the system are predicated on the states preceding them, and
there is sensitivity to initial conditions. In SCT, the interaction between
donor T cells and the recipient may be considered as such a system in which,
graft source, conditioning and early immunosuppression profoundly influence
immune reconstitution over time. This eventually determines clinical outcomes,
either the emergence of tolerance or the development of graft versus host
disease. In this paper parallels between SCT and dynamical systems are explored
and a conceptual framework for developing mathematical models to understand
disparate transplant outcomes is proposed.

Cretaceous to Paleogene, a large impactor collided with Earth being the cause
of the mass extinction occurred at the limit K / Pg. In 1980 there was no known
impact structure, which could be responsible for this extinction. It was not
until 1991 that an international group of researchers proposed that a circular
structure between 180 and 200 km, buried under Tertiary deposits in the Yucatan
Peninsula in Mexico, was the crater formed by the impact proposed by the group
of Alvarez (Hildebrand et al., 1991). It is very probable that an impact of
this magnitude have had large effects on the surface and in the environment. To
study these effects, it is necessary to estimate the characteristics that the
impactor had. The literature often mentions the nature of the impactor, and has
been proposed both an asteroid and a comet, and even a comet shower that
produced periodic extinctions. However, the physical parameters of the impactor
are not limited, so the aim of this study is to estimate the most relevant
features of this one such as the size, mass and kinetic energy. We found that
the kinetic energy of the impactor is in the range from 1.3e24 J to 5.8e25 J.
The mass is in the range of 1.0e15 kg to 4.6e17 kg. Finally, the diameter of
the object is in the range of 10.6 km to 80.9 km. Based on the mass of the
impactor and iridium abundance in different types of meteorites, we calculate
the concentration of iridium, which should be observed in the K/Pg layer. When
compared with the measurements, we concluded that the best estimation is that
the impactor was a comet.

  activity of Twitter users",,,,,"cs.SI cs.CY physics.soc-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Online social networks have emerged as a significant platform for political
discourse. In this paper we investigate what affects the level of participation
of users in the political discussion. Specifically, are users more likely to be
active when they are surrounded by like-minded individuals, or, alternatively,
when their environment is heterogeneous, and so their messages might be carried
to people with differing views. To answer this question, we analyzed the
activity of about 200K Twitter users who expressed explicit support for one of
the candidates of the 2012 US presidential election. We quantified the level of
political activity (PA) of users by the fraction of political tweets in their
posts, and analyzed the relationship between PA and measures of the users'
political environment. These measures were designed to assess the
likemindedness, e.g., the fraction of users with similar political views, of
their virtual and geographic environments. Our results showed that high PA is
usually obtained by users in politically balanced virtual environment. This is
in line with the disagreement theory of political science that states that a
user's PA is invigorated by the disagreement with their peers. Our results also
show that users surrounded by politically like-minded virtual peers tend to
have low PA. This observation contradicts the echo chamber amplification theory
that states that a person tends to be more politically active when surrounded
by like-minded people. Finally, we observe that the likemindedness of the
geographical environment does not affect PA. We thus conclude that PA of users
is independent of the likemindedness of their geographical environment and is
correlated with likemindedness of their virtual environment. The exact form of
correlation manifests the phenomenon of disagreement and, in a majority of
settings, contradicts the echo chamber amplification theory.
