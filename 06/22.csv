Anderson on the flow of superfluid helium, $^4$He at that time. Some of his
""Considerations"" -- the role of the quantum phase as a dynamical variable, the
interplay between the motion of quantised vortices and potential superflow, its
incidence on dissipation in the superfluid and the appearance of critical
velocities, the quest for the hydrodynamic analogues of the Josephson effects
in helium -- and the way they have evolved over the past half-century are
recounted below. But it is due to key advances on the experimental front that
phase slippage could be harnessed in the laboratory, leading to a deeper
understanding of superflow, vortex nucleation, the various intrinsic and
extrinsic dissipation mechanisms in superfluids, macroscopic quantum effects
and the superfluid analogue of both {\it ac} and {\it dc} Josephson effects --
pivotal concepts in superfluid physics -- have been performed. Some of the
experiments that have shed light on the more intimate effect of quantum
mechanics on the hydrodynamics of the dense heliums are surveyed, including the
nucleation of quantised vortices both by Arrhenius processes and by macroscopic
quantum tunnelling, the setting up of vortex mills, and superfluid
interferometry.

profiles of forbidden emission lines of low ionization species. At least two
separate kinematic components have been identified, one characterised by
velocity shifts of tens to hundreds km/s (HVC) and one with much lower velocity
of few km/s (LVC). The HVC are convincingly associated to the emission of jets,
but the origin of the LVC is still unknown. In this paper we analyze the
forbidden line spectrum of a sample of 44 mostly low mass young stars in Lupus
and $\sigma$-Ori observed with the X-Shooter ESO spectrometer. We detect
forbidden line emission of [OI], [OII], [SII], [NI], and [NII], and
characterize the line profiles as LVC, blue-shifted HVC and red-shifted HVC. We
focus our study on the LVC. We show that there is a good correlation between
line luminosity and both L$_{star}$ and the accretion luminosity (or the
mass-accretion rate) over a large interval of values (L$_{star}$ $\sim 10^{-2}
- 1$ L$_\odot$; L$_{acc}$ $\sim 10^{-5} - 10^{-1}$ L$_\odot$; $\dot M_{acc}$
$\sim 10^{-11} - 10^{-7}$ M$_\odot$/yr). The lines show the presence of a slow
wind ($V_{peak}<20$ km/s), dense ($n_H>10^8$ cm$^{-3}$), warm (T$\sim
5000-10000$ K), mostly neutral. We estimate the mass of the emitting gas and
provide a value for the maximum volume it occupies. Both quantities increase
steeply with the stellar mass, from $\sim 10^{-12}$ M$_\odot$ and $\sim 0.01$
AU$^3$ for M$_{star}$$\sim 0.1$ M$_\odot$, to $\sim 3 \times 10^{-10}$
M$_\odot$ and $\sim 1$ AU$^3$ for M$_{star}$$\sim 1$ M$_\odot$, respectively.
These results provide quite stringent constraints to wind models in low mass
young stars, that need to be explored further.

to optimally assign items to users for ranking and how many item assignments
are needed to achieve a target estimation error. For a given assignment of
items to users, we first derive an oracle lower bound of the estimation error
that holds even for the more general Thurstone models. Then we show that the
Cram\'er-Rao lower bound and our upper bounds inversely depend on the spectral
gap of the Laplacian of an appropriately defined comparison graph. When the
system is allowed to choose the item assignment, we propose a random assignment
scheme. Our oracle lower bound and upper bounds imply that it is
minimax-optimal up to a logarithmic factor among all assignment schemes and the
lower bound can be achieved by the maximum likelihood estimator as well as
popular rank-breaking schemes that decompose partial rankings into pairwise

without any uncertainty. Furthermore, when dielectric properties are shown with

networks, but fitting it by maximum likelihood (MLE) involves a computationally
infeasible optimization problem. We propose a new semidefinite programming
(SDP) solution to the problem of fitting the SBM, derived as a relaxation of
the MLE. We put ours and previously proposed SDPs in a unified framework, as
relaxations of the MLE over various sub-classes of the SBM, revealing a
connection to sparse PCA. Our main relaxation, which we call SDP-1, is tighter
than other recently proposed SDP relaxations, and thus previously established
theoretical guarantees carry over. However, we show that SDP-1 exactly recovers
true communities over a wider class of SBMs than those covered by current
results. In particular, the assumption of strong assortativity of the SBM,
implicit in consistency conditions for previously proposed SDPs, can be relaxed
to weak assortativity for our approach, thus significantly broadening the class
of SBMs covered by the consistency results. We also show that strong
assortativity is indeed a necessary condition for exact recovery for previously
proposed SDP approaches and not an artifact of the proofs. Our analysis of SDPs
is based on primal-dual witness constructions, which provides some insight into
the nature of the solutions of various SDPs. We show how to combine features
from SDP-1 and already available SDPs to achieve the most flexibility in terms
of both assortativity and block-size constraints, as our relaxation has the
tendency to produce communities of similar sizes. This tendency makes it the
ideal tool for fitting network histograms, a method gaining popularity in the
graphon estimation literature, as we illustrate on an example of a social
networks of dolphins. We also provide empirical evidence that SDPs outperform
spectral methods for fitting SBMs with a large number of blocks.

Knudsen numbers. In this work, a discrete unified gas-kinetic scheme (DUGKS)
for compressible flows with the consideration of heat transfer and shock
discontinuity is developed based on the Shakhov model with an adjustable
Prandtl number. The method is an explicit finite-volume scheme where the
transport and collision processes are coupled in the evaluation of the fluxes
at cell interfaces, so that the nice asymptotic preserving (AP) property is
retained, such that the time step is limited only by the CFL number, the
distribution function at cell interface recovers to the Chapman-Enskog one in
the continuum limit while reduces to that of free-transport for free-molecular
flow, and the time and spatial accuracy is of second-order accuracy in smooth
region. These features make the DUGKS an ideal method for multiscale
compressible flow simulations. A number of numerical tests, including the shock
structure problem, the Sod tube problem with different degree of
non-equilibrium, and the two-dimensional Riemann problem in continuum and
rarefied regimes, are performed to validate the scheme. The comparisons with
the results of DSMC and other benchmark data demonstrate that the DUGKS is a

With the recent availability of inexpensive 2.5D depth sensors (e.g. Microsoft

representation in the loop. Apart from category recognition, recovering full 3D
shapes from view-based 2.5D depth maps is also a critical part of visual
understanding. To this end, we propose to represent a geometric 3D shape as a
probability distribution of binary variables on a 3D voxel grid, using a
Convolutional Deep Belief Network. Our model, 3D ShapeNets, learns the
distribution of complex 3D shapes across different object categories and
arbitrary poses from raw CAD data, and discovers hierarchical compositional

recognition and shape completion from 2.5D depth maps, and it enables active
object recognition through view planning. To train our 3D deep learning model,
we construct ModelNet -- a large-scale 3D CAD model dataset. Extensive

problem with applications in kernel methods. However, existing SPSD matrix
approximation methods such as the Nystr\""om method only have weak error bounds.
In this paper we conduct in-depth studies of an SPSD matrix approximation model
and establish strong relative-error bounds. We call it the prototype model for
it has more efficient and effective extensions, and some of its extensions have
high scalability. Though the prototype model itself is not suitable for
large-scale data, it is still useful to study its properties, on which the
analysis of its extensions relies.
  This paper offers novel theoretical analysis, efficient algorithms, and a
highly accurate extension. First, we establish a lower error bound for the
prototype model and improve the error bound of an existing column selection
algorithm to match the lower bound. In this way, we obtain the first optimal
column selection algorithm for the prototype model. We also prove that the
prototype model is exact under certain conditions. Second, we develop a simple
column selection algorithm with a provable error bound. Third, we propose a
so-called spectral shifting model to make the approximation more accurate when
the eigenvalues of the matrix decay slowly, and the improvement is
theoretically quantified. The spectral shifting method can also be applied to
improve other SPSD matrix approximation models.

also show that the proposed algorithm can find the optimal solution effectively

stellar-mass and supermassive black hole candidates is produced by the
illumination of a cold accretion disk by a hot corona. In this framework, the
activation of a new flaring region in the hot corona imprints a time variation
on the iron line spectrum. Future X-ray facilities with high time resolution
and large effective areas may be able to measure the so-called 2-dimensional
transfer function; that is, the iron line profile detected by a distant
observer as a function of time in response to an instantaneous flare from the
X-ray primary source. This work is a preliminary study to determine if and how
such a technique can provide more information about the spacetime geometry
around the compact object than the already possible measurements of the
time-integrated iron line profile. Within our simplified model, we find that a
measurement of iron line reverberation can improve constraints appreciably
given a sufficiently strong signal, though that most of the information is
present in the time-integrated spectrum. Our aim is to test the Kerr metric. We
find that current X-ray facilities and data are unable to provide strong tests
of the Kerr nature of supermassive black hole candidates. We consider an
optimistic case of $10^5$ iron line photons from a next-generation data set.

analysis of complex networks. The number of triangles also has important
applications in data mining. Existing distributed memory parallel algorithms
for counting triangles are either Map-Reduce based or message passing interface
(MPI) based and work with overlapping partitions of the given network. These
algorithms are designed for very sparse networks and do not work well when the
degrees of the nodes are relatively larger. For networks with larger degrees,
Map-Reduce based algorithm generates prohibitively large intermediate data, and
in MPI based algorithms with overlapping partitions, each partition can grow as
large as the original network, wiping out the benefit of partitioning the
network.
  In this paper, we present two efficient MPI-based parallel algorithms for
counting triangles in massive networks with large degrees. The first algorithm
is a space-efficient algorithm for networks that do not fit in the main memory
of a single compute node. This algorithm divides the network into
non-overlapping partitions. The second algorithm is for the case where the main
memory of each node is large enough to contain the entire network. We observe
that for such a case, computation load can be balanced dynamically and present
a dynamic load balancing scheme which improves the performance significantly.
Both of our algorithms scale well to large networks and to a large number of
processors.

layers are distinguished: variations in the communications, historical
organization at each moment of time, and evolutionary self-organization of the
codes of communication over time. Furthermore, the codes of communication can
functionally be different and then the system is both horizontally and
vertically differentiated. All these subdynamics operate in parallel and
necessarily generate uncertainty. However, meaningful information can be
considered as the specific selection of a signal from the noise; the codes of
communication are social constructs that can generate redundancy by giving
different meanings to the same information. Reflexively, one can translate
among codes in more elaborate discourses. The second (instantiating) layer can
be operationalized in terms of semantic maps using the vector space model; the
third in terms of mutual redundancy among the latent dimensions of the vector

transfer calculations considering the thermal X-ray emission and the

observations, our initial mass-loss rate estimates require a down-shift by a
factor of roughly 7.7 to $6.5\times10^{-7}$ and $7.5\times10^{-7}$ solar mass
per year for the primary and secondary star, respectively. Furthermore, the low
gas densities and high shock velocities in Cyg OB2#9 are suggestive of unequal
electron and ion temperatures, and the X-ray analysis indicates that an
(immediately post-shock) electron-ion temperature ratio of $\simeq 0.1$ is also
required. The radio emission is dominated by (non-thermal) synchrotron
emission. A parameter space exploration provides evidence against models
assuming equipartition between magnetic and relativistic energy densities.
However, fits of comparable quality can be attained with models having stark
contrasts in the ratio of magnetic-to-relativistic energy densities. The radio
models also reveal a subtle effect whereby inverse Compton cooling leads to an
increase in emissivity as a result of the synchrotron characteristic frequency
being significantly reduced. Finally, using the results of the radio analysis,
we estimate the surface magnetic field strengths to be $\approx 0.3-52\;$G.

contacts between single-band and three-band superconductors is investigated.
The general expression for the Josephson current, which is valid for arbitrary
temperatures, is obtained. We calculate current-phase relations for very low
temperature and in the vicinity of the critical temperature. For three-band
superconductors with broken time-reversal symmetry (BTRS) point contacts
undergo frustration phenomena with different current-phase relations,
corresponding to {\phi}-contacts. For three-band superconductors without BTRS
we have close to sinusoidal current-phase relations and absence of the
frustration, excepting the case of very low temperature, where under certain
conditions two ground states of the point contact are realized. Our results can
be used as the potential probe for the detection of the possible BTRS state in
three-band superconducting systems.

Similar shapes of the line profiles are observed for the CaII IR line at 8542

located in lower solar atmosphere. However, it is still not clear where exactly
the emission of EBs is formed in the solar atmosphere. High-resolution
spectrophotometric observations of EBs were used for determining of their
physical parameters and construction of semi-empirical models. In our analysis
we used observations of EBs obtained in the H-alpha and CaII H lines. We also
used NLTE numerical codes for the construction of grids of 243 semi-empirical
models simulating EBs structures. In this way, the observed emission could be
compared with the calculated line spectra. For a specific model we found
reasonable agreement between the observed and theoretical emission and thus we
consider such model as a good approximation of the EBs atmospheres. This model
is characterized by an enhanced temperature in the lower chromosphere and can
be considered as a compact structure (hot spot). For the first time the set of
two lines H-alpha and CaII H was used to construct semi-empirical models of
EBs. Our analysis shows that EBs can be described by a ""hot spot"" model, with
the temperature and/or density increase through a few hundred km atmospheric

significantly strengthen the constraints on a realistic model.

some fundamental parameters, such as the stellar mass, the metallicity and the

MASSIV sample. We study the cosmic evolution of the mass-metallicty relation

this relation. We then focus on the so-called fundamental metallicity relation
(FMR) proposed by Mannucci et al. (2010) and other relations between stellar
mass, SFR and metallicity as studied by Lara-L\'opez et al. (2010). We
investigate if these relations are really fundamental, i.e. if they do not
evolve with redshift. Results. The MASSIV galaxies follow the expected
mass-metallicity relation for their median redshift. We find however a
significant difference between isolated and interacting galaxies as found for
local galaxies: interacting galaxies tend to have a lower metallicity. The
study of the relation between stellar mass, SFR and metallicity gives such
large scattering for our sample, even combined with zCOSMOS, that it is
diffcult to confirm or deny the existence of a fundamental relation.

validation technique aiming to ensure the correct runtime behavior (w.r.t. a
formal specification) of systems using a so-called enforcement monitor. In this
paper we introduce runtime enforcement of specifications on component-based
systems (CBS) modeled in the BIP (Behavior, Interaction and Priority)
framework. BIP is a powerful and expressive component-based framework for
formal construction of heterogeneous systems. However, because of BIP
expressiveness, it remains difficult to enforce at design-time complex
behavioral properties.
  First we propose a theoretical runtime enforcement framework for CBS where we
delineate a hierarchy of sets of enforceable properties (i.e., properties that
can be enforced) according to the number of observational steps a system is
allowed to deviate from the property (i.e., the notion of k-step
enforceability). To ensure the observational equivalence between the correct
executions of the initial system and the monitored system, we show that i) only
stutter-invariant properties should be enforced on CBS with our monitors, ii)
safety properties are 1-step enforceable. Given an abstract enforcement monitor
(as a finite-state machine) for some 1-step enforceable specification, we
formally instrument (at relevant locations) a given BIP system to integrate the
monitor. At runtime, the monitor observes and automatically avoids any error in
the behavior of the system w.r.t. the specification. Our approach is fully
implemented in an available tool that we used to i) avoid deadlock occurrences
on a dining philosophers benchmark, and ii) ensure the correct placement of
robots on a map.

that irrespectively of the uniaxial mechanical constraint applied, the system

along the constraint direction ($FE_z$ phase) or along one of the pseudo-cubic
axis perpendicular to it ($FE_x$ phase). This contrasts with the cases of
isotropic or biaxial mechanical constraints for which novel phases combining
ferroelectic and antiferrodistortive motions have been previously reported.
Under uniaxial strain, PbTiO$_3$ switched from a $FE_x$ ground state under
compressive strain to $FE_z$ ground-state under tensile strain, beyond a
critical strain $\eta_{zz}^c \approx +1$\%. Under uniaxial stress, PbTiO$_3$
exhibits either a $FE_x$ ground state under compression ($\sigma_{zz} < 0$) or
a $FE_z$ ground state under tension ($\sigma_{zz} > 0$). Here, however, an
abrupt jump of the structural parameters is also predicted under both

negative isotropic pressure and might reveal practically useful to enhance the

enhancement is achieved by down sampling the value component of HSV color space
converted image into three scales (normal, medium and fine) following the
contrast stretching operation. These down sampled value components are enhanced
using the MSR algorithm. The value component is reconstructed by averaging each
pixels of the lower scale image with that of the upper scale image subsequent
to up sampling the lower scale image. This process replaces dark pixel by the
average pixels of both the lower scale and upper scale, while retaining the
bright pixels. The quality of the reconstructed images in the proposed method
is found to be good and far better then the other researchers method. The
performance of the proposed scheme is evaluated using new wavelet domain based

  Technical Report)",,,,,"cs.PL","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Monotonicity in concurrent systems stipulates that, in any global state,
extant system actions remain executable when new processes are added to the
state. This concept is not only natural and common in multi-threaded software,
but also useful: if every thread's memory is finite, monotonicity often
guarantees the decidability of safety property verification even when the
number of running threads is unknown. In this paper, we show that the act of
obtaining finite-data thread abstractions for model checking can be at odds
with monotonicity: Predicate-abstracting certain widely used monotone software
results in non-monotone multi-threaded Boolean programs - the monotonicity is
lost in the abstraction. As a result, well-established sound and complete
safety checking algorithms become inapplicable; in fact, safety checking turns
out to be undecidable for the obtained class of unbounded-thread Boolean
programs. We demonstrate how the abstract programs can be modified into
monotone ones, without affecting safety properties of the non-monotone
abstraction. This significantly improves earlier approaches of enforcing
monotonicity via overapproximations.

the best-fit magnetic field configuration at each of four radial rings spanning
$2.4 - 7.2$ kpc in $1.2$ kpc increments. We find that a two-layer modeling

where the near and far sides of the halo are taken to be identical, although
the resulting best-fit magnetic field strengths are comparable. This implies
that all of the signal from the far halo is depolarized at these wavelengths.
We find a total magnetic field in the disk of approximately $18~\mu$G and a
total magnetic field strength in the halo of $\sim 4-6~\mu$G. Both turbulent

factor of a few. About half of the turbulent magnetic field in the disk is

single-label image classification tasks. However, how CNN best copes with
multi-label images still remains an open problem, mainly due to the complex
underlying object layouts and insufficient multi-label training images. In this
work, we propose a flexible deep CNN infrastructure, called
Hypotheses-CNN-Pooling (HCP), where an arbitrary number of object segment
hypotheses are taken as the inputs, then a shared CNN is connected with each
hypothesis, and finally the CNN output results from different hypotheses are
aggregated with max pooling to produce the ultimate multi-label predictions.
Some unique characteristics of this flexible deep CNN infrastructure include:
1) no ground truth bounding box information is required for training; 2) the
whole HCP infrastructure is robust to possibly noisy and/or redundant
hypotheses; 3) no explicit hypothesis label is required; 4) the shared CNN may
be well pre-trained with a large-scale single-label image dataset, e.g.
ImageNet; and 5) it may naturally output multi-label prediction results.
Experimental results on Pascal VOC2007 and VOC2012 multi-label image datasets
well demonstrate the superiority of the proposed HCP infrastructure over other
state-of-the-arts. In particular, the mAP reaches 84.2% by HCP only and 90.3%

features on the VOC2012 dataset, which significantly outperforms the

show that the models can be exactly solved using elementary techniques, and

crucial for a deeper understanding of the formation of our solar system and the
dynamical process that govern it. In this paper, we investigate the effect of
collisions on the evolution of the spin distribution of asteroids and KBO's.
  We find that the power law nature of the impactors' size distribution leads
to a L\'evy distribution of the spin rates. This results in a power law tail of
the spin distribution, in stark contrast to the usually quoted Maxwellian
distribution. We show that for bodies larger than 10 km, collisions alone lead
to spin rates peaking at 0.15-0.5 revolutions per day. Comparing that to the
observed spin rates of large asteroids ($R>50$ km), we find that the spins of
large asteroids, peaking at $\sim1-2$ revolutions per day, are dominated by a
primordial component that reflects the formation mechanism of the asteroids.
Similarly, the Kuiper Belt has undergone virtually no collisional spin
evolution, assuming current day density. Collisions contribute a spin rate of
$\sim0.01$ revolutions per day, thus the observed fast spin rates of KBOs are
also primordial in nature.

independently in intercepting the CUs-CBS transmissions, which are called the

CUs available, we propose the round-robin scheduling as well as the optimal and
suboptimal user scheduling schemes for improving the security of CUs-CBS
transmissions against eavesdropping attacks. Specifically, the optimal user
scheduling is designed by assuming that the channel state information (CSI) of
all links from CUs to CBS, to primary user (PU) and to eavesdroppers are
available. By contrast, the suboptimal user scheduling only requires the CSI of
CUs-CBS links without the PU's and eavesdroppers' CSI. We derive closed-form

carry out the secrecy diversity analysis and show that the round-robin

whether the eavesdroppers collaborate or not. In addition, numerical secrecy
outage results demonstrate that for both the coordinated and uncoordinated
eavesdroppers, the optimal user scheduling achieves the best security

increasing the number of CUs, the secrecy outage probabilities of the optimal
and suboptimal user scheduling schemes both improve significantly.

  ranges of transverse momenta at LHC","41pages, 13 figures, 1 tables, an updated version for 1406.5733,
  extensive discussions added",,,,"nucl-th nucl-ex","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The production of all identified hadrons at the CERN Large Hadron Collider
(LHC) is studied with emphasis on the $p_T$ distributions up to 20 GeV/c in
central collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=2.76$ TeV. The parton recombination model
is used to determine the hadronic \ppt\ spectra from the quark \dis s. From the
heavy hyperon spectra it is known from earlier studies that the $u, d, s$
thermal \dis s in \ppt\ are exponential with large inverse slopes that cannot
be identified with any temperature in conventional fluid models. They are used
as inputs in our model together with shower partons determined from our
treatment of momentum degradation that uses high-\ppt\ pion data as input.
Those thermal and shower partons are used to calculate the $p_T$ \dis s of all
observed hadrons ($\pi, K, p, \Lambda$, $\Xi$, $\Omega$ and $\phi$) over wide
ranges of \ppt, so the system is highly constrained. We show how well the LHC
data can be reproduced with only a few parameters to adjust. Centrality
dependence has not been studied. What is learned is that minijets are
important, not only in giving rise to abundant shower partons, but also in the
conversion of semihard partons in the medium to soft partons that enhance the
thermal partons. Since the conversion process can occur throughout the
expansion phase of the high-density medium, this work provides the basis for
questioning the validity of the assumption of rapid equilibration.

astrophysical interest can be obtained by extrapolating direct data to the
lower energies, or by indirect methods. The indirect Trojan Horse method, as
well as various R-matrix and polynomial fits to direct data, estimate the
electron screening energies much larger than the adiabatic limit. Calculations
that include the subthreshold resonance estimate smaller screening energies.
  Purpose: Obtain the 6Li(d,a)4He reaction R-matrix parameters and the
astrophysical S factor for the energies relevant to the stellar plasmas by
fitting the R-matrix formulas for the subthreshold resonances to the S factor
data above 60 keV.
  Methods: The bare S factor is calculated using the single and the two-level
R-matrix formulas for the closest to the threshold 0+ and 2+ subthreshold
states at 22.2, 20.2 and 20.1 MeV. The electron screening potential Ue is then
obtained by fitting it as a single parameter to the low energy data.
  Results: The low energy S factor is dominated by the 2+ subthreshold
resonance at 22.2 MeV. The influence of the other two subthreshold states is
small. R-matrix fits result in the electron screening that is smaller than the
adiabatic value. Neglecting the electron screening above 60 keV reduces the
electron screening potential significantly. Calculations show a large ambiguity
associated with a choice of the initial channel radius.
  Conclusions: The R matrix fits do not show a significantly larger Ue than
predicted by the atomic physics models. The R-matrix best fit produces Ue=149.5
eV and Sb(0)=21.7 MeV b.

  Representations in Nonlinear Dimensionality Reduction","44 pages, 10 figures, 1 table",,,,"stat.ML cs.LG math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Classical multidimensional scaling only works well when the noisy distances
observed in a high dimensional space can be faithfully represented by Euclidean
distances in a low dimensional space. Advanced models such as Maximum Variance
Unfolding (MVU) and Minimum Volume Embedding (MVE) use Semi-Definite
Programming (SDP) to reconstruct such faithful representations. While those SDP
models are capable of producing high quality configuration numerically, they
suffer two major drawbacks. One is that there exist no theoretically guaranteed
bounds on the quality of the configuration. The other is that they are slow in
computation when the data points are beyond moderate size. In this paper, we
propose a convex optimization model of Euclidean distance matrices. We
establish a non-asymptotic error bound for the random graph model with
sub-Gaussian noise, and prove that our model produces a matrix estimator of
high accuracy when the order of the uniform sample size is roughly the degree
of freedom of a low-rank matrix up to a logarithmic factor. Our results
partially explain why MVU and MVE often work well. Moreover, we develop a fast
inexact accelerated proximal gradient method. Numerical experiments show that
the model can produce configurations of high quality on large data points that
the SDP approach would struggle to cope with.

driven by the urgent need for public security and safety (due to the growing
threats of terrorism, vandalism, and anti-social behavior). Traditionally,
surveillance systems are comprised of two components - video cameras
distributed over the guarded area and human observer watching and analyzing the
incoming video. Explosive growth of installed cameras and limited human
operator's ability to process the delivered video content raise an urgent
demand for developing surveillance systems with human like cognitive
capabilities, that is - Cognitive surveillance systems. The growing interest in
this issue is testified by the tens of workshops, symposiums and conferences
held over the world each year. The IEEE International Conference on Advanced
Video and Signal-Based Surveillance (AVSS) is certainly one of them. However,
for unknown reasons, the term Cognitive Surveillance does never appear among
its topics. As to me, the explanation for this is simple - the complexity and
the indefinable nature of the term ""Cognition"". In this paper, I am trying to
resolve the problem providing a novel definition of cognition equally suitable
for biological as well as technological applications. I hope my humble efforts
will be helpful.

electric power grid. Here, we perform a statistical analysis of 11,242
insurance claims from 2000 through 2010 for equipment losses and related
business interruptions in North-American commercial organizations that are
associated with damage to, or malfunction of, electrical and electronic
equipment. We find that claims rates are elevated on days with elevated
geomagnetic activity by approximately 20% for the top 5%, and by about 10% for
the top third of most active days ranked by daily maximum variability of the
geomagnetic field. When focusing on the claims explicitly attributed to
electrical surges (amounting to more than half the total sample), we find that
the dependence of claims rates on geomagnetic activity mirrors that of major
disturbances in the U.S. high-voltage electric power grid. The claims
statistics thus reveal that large-scale geomagnetic variability couples into
the low-voltage power distribution network and that related power-quality
variations can cause malfunctions and failures in electrical and electronic
devices that, in turn, lead to an estimated 500 claims per average year within
North America. We discuss the possible magnitude of the full economic impact
associated with quality variations in electrical power associated with space
weather.
