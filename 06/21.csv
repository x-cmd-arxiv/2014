two neutron stars. Recent numerical simulations with microphysical equation of
state suggest the outcome of such events depends on the mass of the neutron
stars. For less massive systems, simulations favor the formation of a
hypermassive, quasi-stable neutron star, whose oscillations produce a short,
high frequency burst of gravitational radiation. Its dominant frequency content
is tightly correlated with the radius of the neutron star, and its measurement
can be used to constrain the supranuclear equation of state. In contrast, the
merger of higher mass systems results in prompt gravitational collapse to a
black hole. We have developed an algorithm which combines waveform
reconstruction from a morphology-independent search for gravitational wave
transients with Bayesian model selection, to discriminate between post-merger
scenarios and accurately measure the dominant oscillation frequency. We
demonstrate the efficacy of the method using a catalogue of simulated binary
merger signals in data from LIGO and Virgo, and we discuss the prospects for
this analysis in advanced ground-based gravitational wave detectors. From the
waveforms considered in this work and assuming an optimally oriented source, we
find that the post-merger neutron star signal may be detectable by this
technique to $\sim 10\text{--}25$\,Mpc. We also find that we successfully
discriminate between the post-merger scenarios with $\sim 95\%$ accuracy and
determine the dominant oscillation frequency of surviving post-merger neutron
stars to within $\sim 10$\,Hz, averaged over all detected signals. This leads
to an uncertainty in the estimated radius of a non-rotating 1.6\,M$_{\odot}$

solving the full Vlasov equation in one region while the remaining area is
treated by a 5-moment two-fluid code. In such a treatment, the main challenge
of coupling kinetic and fluid descriptions is the interchange of physically
correct boundary conditions between the different plasma models. In contrast to
other treatments, we do not rely on any specific form of the distribution
function, e.g. a Maxwellian type. Instead, we combine an extrapolation of the
distribution function and a correction of the moments based on the fluid data.
Thus, throughout the simulation both codes provide the necessary boundary
conditions for each other. A speed-up factor of around 20 is achieved by using
GPUs for the computationally expensive solution of the Vlasov equation and an
overall factor of at least 60 using the coupling strategy combined with the GPU
computation. The coupled codes were then tested on the GEM reconnection

is investigated in a general curved space-time, and then the equations are
particularized to the flat case. Unlike traditional approaches of NGT, in which
the gravitational field is responsible for breaking the symmetry of the flat
Minkowski metric, we find more natural to consider that, in general, the metric
of the space-time could be nonsymmetric even in the flat case. The physical
consequences of this assumption are explored in detail. Interestingly enough,
it is found that the metric tensor splits into a bosonic and a fermionic; the
antisymmetric part of the metric is very sensitive to the spin and turns out to
be undetectable for spinless scalar particles. However, fermions couple to it
in a non-trivial way (only when there are interactions). In addition, the Pauli

the function $N(T,\beta)$ defined to be the number of pairs $\gamma$ and
$\gamma'$ of ordinates of nontrivial zeros of the Riemann zeta-function
satisfying $0<\gamma,\gamma'\leq T$ and $0 < \gamma'-\gamma \leq 2\pi
\beta/\log T$ as $T\to \infty$. In this paper, assuming the Riemann hypothesis,
we prove upper and lower bounds for $N(T,\beta)$, for all $\beta >0$, using
Montgomery's formula and some extremal functions of exponential type. These
functions are optimal in the sense that they majorize and minorize the
characteristic function of the interval $[-\beta, \beta]$ in a way to minimize
the $L^1\big(\mathbb{R}, \big\{1 - \big(\frac{\sin \pi x}{\pi x}\big)^2
\big\}\,dx\big)$-error. We give a complete solution for this extremal problem
using the framework of reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces of entire functions.
This extends previous work by P. X. Gallagher in 1985, where the case $\beta
\in \frac12 \mathbb{N}$ was considered using non-extremal majorants and

nucleon-nucleon centre-of-mass energy of 5.02 TeV. The transverse-momentum
range 0.7 $ < p_{\rm{T}, assoc} < p_{\rm{T}, trig} <$ 5.0 GeV/$c$ is examined,
to include correlations induced by jets originating from low
momen\-tum-transfer scatterings (minijets). The correlations expressed as
associated yield per trigger particle are obtained in the pseudorapidity range
$|\eta|<0.9$. The near-side long-range pseudorapidity correlations observed in
high-multiplicity p-Pb collisions are subtracted from both near-side
short-range and away-side correlations in order to remove the non-jet-like
components. The yields in the jet-like peaks are found to be invariant with
event multiplicity with the exception of events with low multiplicity. This
invariance is consistent with the particles being produced via the incoherent
fragmentation of multiple parton--parton scatterings, while the yield related
to the previously observed ridge structures is not jet-related. The number of
uncorrelated sources of particle production is found to increase linearly with
multiplicity, suggesting no saturation of the number of multi-parton
interactions even in the highest multiplicity p-Pb collisions. Further, the
number scales in the intermediate multiplicity region with the number of binary
nucleon-nucleon collisions estimated with a Glauber Monte-Carlo simulation.

the scales corresponding to those leaving the horizon during the transition. In

long as the variation of the Planck mass is below the percent level. Otherwise,
the tensor power spectra exhibit damped oscillations over the same scales. Due
to significant features in the scalar power spectra, the tensor-to-scalar ratio

to a shift of the entire spectrum to higher frequencies, or in the dispersive

introducing the so-called Hesse potential, which is defined in terms of duality

This paper presents a method to construct a basis of the probability space of

quantum and classical dissipative evolution lead to a stationary state with the

our ideas we use spin systems whose dynamics becomes correlated and complex due
to dynamical constraints, inspired by kinetically constrained models (KCMs) of
classical glasses. We show that in the quantum case the relaxation can be
orders of magnitude slower than the classical one due to the presence of
quantum coherences. Aspects of these idealized quantum KCMs become manifest in
a strongly interacting Rydberg gas under electromagnetically induced

between this Rydberg gas and the rather abstract dissipative KCMs of quantum
glassy systems, our study sheds light on the limitations of the use of
classical rate equations for capturing the non-equilibrium behavior of this

  functional characterisation for ultra-high frequency cross-sectional LOB data",,,,,"q-fin.ST","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We present a large-scale study of commonality in liquidity and resilience
across assets in an ultra high-frequency (millisecond-timestamped) Limit Order
Book (LOB) dataset from a pan-European electronic equity trading facility. We
first show that extant work in quantifying liquidity commonality through the
degree of explanatory power of the dominant modes of variation of liquidity
(extracted through Principal Component Analysis) fails to account for heavy
tailed features in the data, thus producing potentially misleading results. We
employ Independent Component Analysis, which both decorrelates the liquidity
measures in the asset cross-section, but also reduces higher-order statistical
dependencies.
  To measure commonality in liquidity resilience, we utilise a novel
characterisation as the time required for return to a threshold liquidity
level. This reflects a dimension of liquidity that is not captured by the
majority of liquidity measures and has important ramifications for
understanding supply and demand pressures for market makers in electronic
exchanges, as well as regulators and HFTs. When the metric is mapped out across
a range of thresholds, it produces the daily Liquidity Resilience Profile (LRP)
for a given asset. This daily summary of liquidity resilience behaviour from
the vast LOB dataset is then amenable to a functional data representation. This
enables the comparison of liquidity resilience in the asset cross-section via
functional linear sub-space decompositions and functional regression. The
functional regression results presented here suggest that market factors for
liquidity resilience (as extracted through functional principal components
analysis) can explain between 10 and 40% of the variation in liquidity
resilience at low liquidity thresholds, but are less explanatory at more
extreme levels, where individual asset factors take effect.

of a new spectral component with fluxes increasing for larger frequencies,
separated from the well-known microwave emission that maximizes in the GHz
range. Suggested interpretations explain the THz spectral component, but do not
account for the simultaneous microwave component. We present a mechanism for
producing the observed double-spectra. Based on coherent enhancement of
synchrotron emission at long wavelengths in laboratory accelerators, we
consider how similar processes may occur within a solar flare. The instability
known as microbunching arises from perturbations that produce electron beam
density modulations, giving rise to broadband coherent synchrotron emission at
wavelengths comparable to the characteristic size of the microbunch structure.
The spectral intensity of this coherent synchrotron radiation (CSR) can far
exceed that of the incoherent synchrotron radiation (ISR), which peaks at
higher frequency, thus producing a double-peaked spectrum. Successful CSR
simulations are shown to fit actual burst spectral observations, using typical
flaring physical parameters and power-law energy distributions for the
accelerated electrons. The simulations consider an energy threshold below which
microbunching is not possible because of Coulomb repulsion. Only a small
fraction of the radiating charges accelerated to energies above the threshold
is required to produce the microwave component observed for several events. The
ISR-CSR mechanism can occur together with other emission processes producing
the microwave component. It may bring an important contribution at microwaves
at least for certain events where physical conditions for the occurrence of the
ISR-CSR microbunching mechanism are possible.

to be 1.341$\pm$0.007 M$_\odot$, and a low neutron star (NS) companion mass of
1.230$\pm$0.007 M$_\odot$. We also determined an upper limit to the spin-orbit
misalignment angle of 34{\deg} (95%) based on a system geometry fit to
long-term profile width measurements. These and other observed properties have
led us to hypothesize an evolution involving a low mass loss, symmetric
supernova progenitor to the second-formed NS companion, as is thought to be the
case for the double pulsar system PSR J0737$-$3039A/B. This would make PSR
J1756$-$2251 the second compact binary system providing concrete evidence for
this type of NS formation channel.

light. It is possible to estimate the amount of such scattered light, and even
correct for it, with a radially extended point spread function (PSF). The outer
parts of the PSF have only rarely been determined, since they are faint and
therefore difficult to measure. A mostly complete overview of existing
properties and measurements of radially extended PSFs is presented, to both
show their similarities and to indicate how bright extended objects can be used
to measure the faintest regions. The importance of the far wings of the PSF and
their possible temporal variations are demonstrated in three edge-on galaxy
models. The same study is applied to the first edge-on galaxy where earlier
observations reveal a halo, NGC 5907. All PSFs were collected in two diagrams,
after they were offset or normalized, when that was possible.
Surface-brightness structures of edge-on galaxies were modelled and analysed to
study scattered-light haloes that result with an exponential disc. The models
were convolved with both a lower-limit PSF and a more average PSF. The PSF of
the observed data could be used in the case of NGC 5907. The comparison of the
PSFs demonstrates a lower-limit $r^{-2}$ power-law decline at larger radii. The
analysis of the galaxy models shows that also the outer parts of the PSF are
important to correctly model and analyse observations and, in particular,
fainter regions. The reassessed analysis of the earlier measurements of NGC
5907 reveals an explanation for the faint halo in scattered light, within the
quoted level of accuracy.

develop large density fluctuations independent of gas density fluctuations.
Specifically, gas turbulence can drive order-of-magnitude 'resonant'
fluctuations in the dust on scales where the gas stopping/drag timescale is
comparable to the turbulent eddy turnover time. Here we show that for large
grains (size >0.1 micron, containing most grain mass) in sufficiently large
molecular clouds (radii >1-10 pc, masses >10^4 M_sun), this scale becomes
larger than the characteristic sizes of pre-stellar cores (the sonic length),
so large fluctuations in the dust-to-gas ratio are imprinted on cores. As a
result, star clusters and protostellar disks formed in large clouds should
exhibit significant abundance spreads in the elements preferentially found in
large grains. This naturally predicts populations of carbon-enhanced stars,
certain highly unusual stellar populations observed in nearby open clusters,
and may explain the 'UV upturn' in early-type galaxies. It will also
dramatically change planet formation in the resulting protostellar disks, by
preferentially 'seeding' disks with an enhancement in large carbonaceous or
silicate grains. The relevant threshold for this behavior scales simply with
cloud densities and temperatures, making straightforward predictions for
clusters in starbursts and high-redshift galaxies. Because of the selective
sorting by size, this process is not necessarily visible in extinction mapping.
We also predict the shape of the abundance distribution -- when these
fluctuations occur, a small fraction of the cores may actually be seeded with
abundances ~100 times the mean, such that they are almost 'totally metal'
(Z~1)! Assuming the cores collapse, these totally metal stars would be rare (1
in 10^4 in clusters where this occurs), but represent a fundamentally new
stellar evolution channel.

It was
recently suggested that fluctuations in the background of these objects are
extremely long-lived and might turn unstable at the nonlinear level, if the
object is not endowed with a horizon. If correct, this result has important
consequences: objects with a light ring are black holes. In other words, the
nonlinear instability of ultracompact stars would provide a strong argument in
favor of the ""black hole hypothesis,"" once electromagnetic or
gravitational-wave observations confirm the existence of light rings. Here we
explore in some depth the mode structure of ultracompact stars, in particular
constant-density stars and gravastars. We show that the existence of very
long-lived modes -- localized near a second, stable null geodesic -- is a
generic feature of gravitational perturbations of such configurations. Already
at the linear level, such modes become unstable if the object rotates
sufficiently fast to develop an ergoregion. Finally, we conjecture that the
long-lived modes become unstable under fragmentation via a
Dyson-Chandrasekhar-Fermi mechanism at the nonlinear level. Depending on the
structure of the star, it is also possible that nonlinearities lead to the
formation of small black holes close to the stable light ring. Our results
suggest that the mere observation of a light ring is a strong evidence for the
existence of black holes.

the probable stream progenitor nucleus. These objects delineate a kinematically

a very eccentric orbit with a period of roughly 0.35 Gyr and turning points at

The X-ray spectrum is approximated by a steep power law, with photon index of
3.2, identifying the source as being in the very high state. A more detailed
fit shows that the X-ray continuum is well described by a multi-color disc,
together with thermal and non-thermal Comptonization. The inner disc appears
slightly truncated by comparison with a previous high/soft state of this
source, even taking into account energetic coupling between the disc and
corona, although there are uncertainties due to the dust scattering correction.
The near-infrared fluxes are higher than the extrapolated disc model, showing
that there is a contribution from irradiation in the outer disk and/or the
companion star at these wavelengths. Our X-ray spectra do not show the Doppler
shifted iron emission lines indicating a baryonic jet which were seen four days
previously in an XMM-Newton observation, despite the source being in a similar
state. There are also no significant absorption lines from highly ionized irons
as are seen in the previous high/soft state data. We show that the increased
source luminosity is not enough on its own to make the wind so highly ionized

stellar populations. It appears that they experience at least two episodes of
star formation whereby a fraction of first-generation stars contribute astrated
ejecta to form the second generation(s). To identify the polluting progenitors
we require distinguishing chemical signatures such as that provided by lithium.
Theoretical models predict that lithium can be synthesised in AGB stars,
whereas no net Li production is expected from other candidates. It has been
shown that in order to reproduce the abundance pattern found in M4, Li
production must occur within the polluters, favouring the AGB scenario. Here we
present Li and Al abundances for a large sample of RGB stars in M12 and M5.
These clusters have a very similar metallicity, whilst demonstrating
differences in several cluster properties. Our results indicate that the
first-generation and second-generation stars share the same Li content in M12;
we recover an abundance pattern similar to that observed in M4. In M5 we find a
higher degree of complexity and a simple dilution model fails in reproducing
the majority of the stellar population. In both clusters we require Li
production across the different stellar generations, but production seems to
have occurred to different extents. We suggest that such a difference might be
related to the cluster mass with the Li production being more efficient in
less-massive clusters. This is the first time a statistically significant
correlation between the Li spread within a GC and its luminosity has been
demonstrated. Finally, although Li-producing polluters are required to account
for the observed pattern, other mechanisms, such as MS depletion, might have
played a role in contributing to the Li internal variation, though at
relatively low level.

work we use a new, fully conservative version of the Cosmos++ general
relativistic magnetohydrodynamics (GRMHD) code, coupled with an ad hoc cooling
function designed to control the thickness of the disk. Together these allow us
to simulate the thinnest tilted accretion disks ever using a GRMHD code. In
this way, we are able to probe the regime where the dimensionless stress and
scale height of the disk become comparable. We present results for both
prograde and retrograde cases. The simulated prograde tilted disk shows no sign
of Bardeen-Petterson alignment even in the innermost parts of the disk. The
simulated retrograde tilted disk, however, does show modest alignment. The
implication of these results is that the parameter space associated with
Bardeen-Petterson alignment for prograde disks may be rather small, only
including very thin disks. Unlike our previous work, we find no evidence for
standing shocks in our simulated tilted disks. We ascribe this to the
combination of small black hole spin, small tilt angle, and small disk scale
height in these simulations. We also add to the growing body of literature
pointing out that the turbulence driven by the magnetorotational instability in
global simulations of accretion disks is not isotropic. Finally, we provide a
comparison between our moderately thin, untilted reference simulation and other
numerical simulations of thin disks in the literature.

from numerical simulations as inputs to the analytic twisted disk model of

relativistic models of tilted and twisted disks having a moderate effective
viscosity around a slowly rotating Kerr black hole are considered.
Qualitatively, the analytic model demonstrates the same dynamics as the
simulations, although with some quantitative offset. Namely, the GRMHD
simulations generally give smaller variations of tilt and twist across the
disk. When the black hole and the disk rotate in the same sense, the simulated
tilted disk and analytic model show no sign of Bardeen-Petterson alignment,
even in the innermost parts of the disk, where the characteristic time for
relaxation to a quasi-stationary configuration is of the same order as the
computation time. In the opposite case, when the direction of the disk's
rotation is opposite to that of black hole, a partial alignment is observed, in
agreement with previous theoretical estimates. Thus, both fully numerical and
analytic schemes demonstrate that the Bardeen-Petterson effect may not be
possible for the case of prograde rotation provided that disk's effective
viscosity is sufficiently small. This may have implications in modeling of
different astrophysical phenomena, such as disk spectra and jet orientation.

two samples of of radio loud AGNs with similar radio properties but different
orientations: a sample of quasars and a sample of radio galaxies. A
morphological comparison suggests a scenario where the three-dimensional EELR
gas distribution follows rough biconical shapes with wide opening angles. The
average extent of the EELRs is $\sim 18.5$ kpc. The estimated average mass of
the EELRs, with reasonable assumptions for gas densities, is $\sim 3 \times

The EELRs around quasars and radio galaxies share similar kinematic properties.
Both samples have velocity structures that display a range of complexities and
they do not appear to correlate with the jet orientations, and both span a
similar range of velocity dispersions. Around 30\% of the detected EELRs show
large scale rotational motions, which may have originated from recent mergers

give a brief survey of some important approaches and modern tendencies in
quantum measurement. I wish it to be clear from the outset that I shy
explicitly away from the ""quantum measurement problem,"" and that the present
treatment aims to elucidate the theory and practice of various ways in which
measurements can, in light of quantum mechanics, be carried out; and various
formalisms for describing them. While the treatment is by necessity largely
theoretical, the emphasis is meant to be on an experimental ""perspective"" on
measurement -- that is, to place the priority on the possibility of gaining
information through some process, and then attempting to model that process
mathematically and consider its ramifications, rather than stressing a
particular mathematical definition as the {\it sine qua non} of measurement.
The textbook definition of measurement as being a particular set of
mathematical operations carried out on particular sorts of operators has been
so well drilled into us that many have the unfortunate tendency of saying ""that
experiment can't be described by projections onto the eigenstates of a
Hermitian operator, so it is not really a measurement,"" when of course any
practitioner of an experimental science such as physics should instead say
""that experiment allowed us to measure something, and if the standard theory of
measurement does not describe it, the standard theory of measurement is
incomplete."" Idealisations are important, but when the real world breaks the
approximations made in the theory, it is the theory which must be fixed, and
not the real world.

be interpreted as an attempt to reduce the so-called cosmic sector (dark matter
plus dark energy) and relate the two cosmic accelerating phases (early and late
time de Sitter expansions). A detailed thermodynamic analysis including
possible quantum corrections is also carried out. For a very wide range of the
free parameters, it is found that the model presents the expected behavior of
an ordinary macroscopic system in the sense that it approaches thermodynamic
equilibrium in the long run (i.e., as it nears the second de Sitter phase).
Moreover, an upper bound is found for the Gibbons-Hawking temperature of the
primordial de Sitter phase. Finally, when confronted with the recent
observational data, the current `quasi'-de Sitter era, as predicted by the
model, is seen to pass very comfortably the cosmic background tests.

general relativity in strong and dynamical regimes of gravity. One of the tests
is checking whether GW propagates with the speed of light or not. This test is
crucial because the velocity of GW has not ever been directly measured.
Propagation speed of a GW can deviate from the speed of light due to the
modification of gravity, graviton mass, and the nontrivial spacetime structure
such as extra dimensions and quantum gravity effects. Here we report a simple
method to measure the propagation speed of a GW by directly comparing arrival
times between gravitational waves, and neutrinos from supernovae or photons
from short gamma-ray bursts. As a result, we found that the future
multimessenger observations of a GW, neutrinos, and photons can test the GW
propagation speed with the precision of ~10^{-16} improving the previous
suggestions by 8-10 orders of magnitude. We also propose a novel method that
distinguishes the true signal due to the deviation of GW propagation speed from
the speed of light and the intrinsic time delay of the emission at a source by
looking at the redshift dependence.

function of the temperature using analytical and numerical techniques. We
present results for the energetics, structural properties, condensate fraction,
superfluid fraction, and superfluid density. Our calculations for the two-body
system underline that the condensate and superfluid fractions are distinctly
different quantities. Our work demonstrates that the path integral Monte Carlo
method yields reliable results for bosonic and fermionic systems over a wide
temperature range, including the regime where the de Broglie wave length is
large, i.e., where the statistics plays an important role. The regime where the
Fermi sign problem leads to reasonably large signal to noise ratios is mapped
out for selected parameter combinations. Our calculations for bosons focus on
the unitary regime, where the physics is expected to be governed by the
three-body parameter. If the three-body parameter is large compared to the
inverse of the harmonic oscillator length, we find that the bosons form a
droplet at low temperature and behave approximately like a non-interacting Bose

through the proximity effect and therefore require a layer of a conventional
superconductor deposited on top of another system, which lends its topological
properties\cite{Fu,Sau,Alicea}. The necessity of the superconducting layer
poses some technical complications and, in particular, makes it harder to probe
the Majorana state. In this work we propose to replace the proximity effect
pairing by an innate tendency for pairing, mediated by interactions. We use a
model system with spin orbit coupling and on-site repulsion and apply
renormalization group to the interaction vertex. Without a Zeeman field this
model exhibits pairing instabilities in different channels depending on the
tuning of parameters. Once a Zeeman field is introduced the model favors
topological superconductivity where the order parameter winds an odd number of
times around the Fermi surface. This suggests that certain superconductors,
with strong spin-orbit coupling, may go through a topological phase transition
as a function of applied magnetic field.

self-interference cancellation techniques in full-duplex systems. However, its
mitigation capability is very limited, mainly due to transmitter and receiver
circuit's impairments. In this paper, we propose a novel digital
self-interference cancellation technique for full-duplex systems. The proposed
technique is shown to significantly mitigate the self-interference signal as
well as the associated transmitter and receiver impairments. In the proposed
technique, an auxiliary receiver chain is used to obtain a digital-domain copy
of the transmitted Radio Frequency (RF) self-interference signal. The
self-interference copy is then used in the digital-domain to cancel out both
the self-interference signal and the associated impairments. Furthermore, to
alleviate the receiver phase noise effect, a common oscillator is shared
between the auxiliary and ordinary receiver chains. A thorough analytical and
numerical analysis for the effect of the transmitter and receiver impairments
on the cancellation capability of the proposed technique is presented. Finally,
the overall performance is numerically investigated showing that using the
proposed technique, the self-interference signal could be mitigated to ~3dB
higher than the receiver noise floor, which results in up to 76% rate
improvement compared to conventional half-duplex systems at 20dBm transmit

the need to schedule maintenance activities in infrastructure networks, such as
rail or general logistics networks. Network elements must undergo regular
preventive maintenance, shutting down the arc for the duration of the activity.
Careful coordination of these arc maintenance jobs can dramatically reduce the
impact of such shutdown jobs on the flow carried by the network. Scheduling
such jobs between given release dates and deadlines so as to maximize the total
flow over time presents an intriguing case to study the role of time
discretization. Here we prove that if the problem data is integer, and no flow
can be stored at nodes, we can restrict attention to integer job start times.
However if flow can be stored, fractional start times may be needed. This makes
traditional strong integer programming scheduling models difficult to apply.
Here we formulate an exact integer programming model for the continuous time
problem, as well as integer programming models based on time discretization
that can provide dual bounds, and that can - with minor modifications - also
yield primal bounds. The resulting bounds are demonstrated to have small gaps
on test instances, and offer a good trade-off for bound quality against
computing time.

Babcock-Leighton-type models of the solar dynamo and are crucial for the
build-up and reversals of the polar fields in Surface Flux Transport (SFT)
simulations. The evolution of the polar field is a consequence of Hale's
polarity rules, together with the tilt angle distribution which has a
systematic component (Joy's law) and a random component (tilt-angle scatter).
We determine the scatter using the observed tilt angle data and study the
effects of this scatter on the evolution of the solar surface field using SFT
simulations with flux input based upon the recorded sunspot groups. The tilt
angle scatter is described in our simulations by a random component according
to the observed distributions for different ranges of sunspot group size (total
umbral area). By performing simulations with a number of different realizations
of the scatter we study the effect of the tilt angle scatter on the global
magnetic field, especially on the evolution of the axial dipole moment. The
average axial dipole moment at the end of cycle 17 (a medium-amplitude cycle)
from our simulations was 2.73G. The tilt angle scatter leads to an uncertainty
of 0.78 G (standard deviation). We also considered cycle 14 (a weak cycle) and
cycle 19 (a strong cycle) and show that the standard deviation of the axial
dipole moment is similar for all three cycles. The uncertainty mainly results
from the big sunspot groups which emerge near the equator. In the framework of
Babcock-Leighton dynamo models, the tilt angle scatter therefore constitutes a
significant random factor in the cycle-to-cycle amplitude variability, which
strongly limits the predictability of solar activity.

conducted by the FBI and the Microsoft Digital Crimes Unit in order to take
down Citadel command-and-control servers. The operation caused some disruption
in the botnet but has not stopped it completely. Due to the complex structure
and advanced anti-reverse engineering techniques, the Citadel malware analysis
process is both challenging and time-consuming. This allows cyber criminals to
carry on with their attacks while the analysis is still in progress. In this
paper, we present the results of the Citadel reverse engineering and provide
additional insight into the functionality, inner workings, and open source
components of the malware. In order to accelerate the reverse engineering
process, we propose a clone-based analysis methodology. Citadel is an offspring
of a previously analyzed malware called Zeus; thus, using the former as a
reference, we can measure and quantify the similarities and differences of the
new variant. Two types of code analysis techniques are provided in the
methodology, namely assembly to source code matching and binary clone
detection. The methodology can help reduce the number of functions requiring
manual analysis. The analysis results prove that the approach is promising in
Citadel malware analysis. Furthermore, the same approach is applicable to
similar malware analysis scenarios.

spontaneous transition rates and the geometric phase for a circularly
accelerated atom do not exhibit a clear sign of thermal radiation characterized
by the Planckian factor in contrast to the linear acceleration case. The
spontaneous transition rates and effective temperature of the atom are examined
in detail in the ultrarelativistic limit and are shown to be always larger than
those in the linear acceleration case with the same proper acceleration. Unlike
the effective temperature, the geometric phase is dependent on the initial
atomic states. We show that when the polar angle in Bloch sphere, $\theta$,
that characterizes the initial state of the atom equals $\pi/{2}$, the
geometric phases acquired due to circular and linear acceleration are the same.
However, for a generic state with an arbitrary $\theta$, the phase will be in
general different, and then we demonstrate in the ultrarelativistic limit that
the geometric phase acquired for the atom in circular motion is always larger

spectra can be statistically very well described by the flicker noise model
over wide frequency range from a few tens of MHz up to tens of GHz. Moreover,
our dataset allows us to conduct statistical analysis of the model parameters.
As our results show, there is a strong negative correlation between the flicker
noise spectrum model parameters log $S_0$ and $n$ and a strong positive
relationship between n and the power-law spectral index $\alpha$. The latter
implies that their physical meaning is similar, however the flicker noise model
has an advantage over broken power-law model. Not only it describes the spectra
in higher frequency range with only two parameters, not counting scaling factor
$S_0$, but also it shows smooth transition from flat to steep behaviour at
lower and higher frequencies, respectively. On the other hand, there are no

edge of the habitable zone of GJ 832, an M dwarf previously known to host a
Jupiter analog in a nearly-circular 9.4-year orbit. The combination of precise
radial-velocity measurements from three telescopes reveals the presence of a
planet with a period of 35.68+/-0.03 days and minimum mass (m sin i) of
5.4+/-1.0 Earth masses. GJ 832c moves on a low-eccentricity orbit
(e=0.18+/-0.13) towards the inner edge of the habitable zone. However, given
the large mass of the planet, it seems likely that it would possess a massive
atmosphere, which may well render the planet inhospitable. Indeed, it is
perhaps more likely that GJ 832c is a ""super-Venus,"" featuring significant
greenhouse forcing. With an outer giant planet and an interior, potentially
rocky planet, the GJ 832 planetary system can be thought of as a miniature
version of our own Solar system.

a reliable inter-vehicular V2X communication has to focus on optimizing its
real performances. In this work, we studied the fact that WAVE transmission
uses the channel characteristics designed for indoor and stationary
communication terminals in IEEE 802.11a. In this paper, we propose an approach
to overcome this mobility problem of terminal communication. The considered
solution consists in using pilot estimation technique to reduce the high bit
error rate. First, we highlight the impact of rearranging the pilot symbol
positions on the quality of transmission QoT. Second, we try to overcome one of
the PHY layer estimation constraints by adding two new pilot symbols. By
considering pilot symbol aided channel estimation at the transmitter, we focus
on Least Square LS and Minimum Mean Square Error MMSE channel estimation on the
receiver. A range of simulations is carried out according to ratio between the
Bit Error Rate BER and the Signal to Noise Ratio SNR. We demonstrate that
rearranging pilot pattern can offer better results than standardized ones.
Furthermore, we prove that adding pilots symbols can provide the best
performances.

envelope of the X-ray emitting groups. We find evidence for our optically
selected groups to be under-luminous with respect to predictions from X-ray
scaling relations. X-ray mass determinations are in best agreement with those
based on the member galaxies bulge luminosity, followed by their total optical
luminosity and velocity dispersion. We measure a stellar mass fraction with a

phase whereas they should have been depleted, frozen on dust grains. In order
to solve this problem, astrochemists have proposed that a fraction of molecules
synthesized on the surface of dust grains could desorb just after their
formation. Recently the chemical desorption process has been demonstrated
experimentally, but the key parameters at play have not yet been fully
understood. In this article we propose a new procedure to analyze the ratio of
di-oxygen and ozone synthesized after O atoms adsorption on oxidized graphite.
We demonstrate that the chemical desorption efficiency of the two reaction
paths (O+O and O+O$_2$) is different by one order of magnitude. We show the
importance of the surface coverage: for the O+O reaction, the chemical
desorption efficiency is close to 80 $\%$ at zero coverage and tends to zero at
one monolayer coverage. The coverage dependence of O+O chemical desorption is
proved by varying the amount of pre-adsorbed N$_2$ on the substrate from 0 to
1.5 ML. Finally, we discuss the relevance of the different physical parameters
that could play a role in the chemical desorption process: binding energy,
enthalpy of formation, and energy transfer from the new molecule to the surface
or to other adsorbates.

lead to the formation of planets are still not well understood. But thanks to
the high number of known exoplanets, it is now possible to look at them as a
population that puts statistical constraints on theoretical models. A method
that uses these constraints is planetary population synthesis. Its key element
is a global model of planet formation and evolution that directly predicts
observable planetary properties based on properties of the natal protoplanetary
disk. To do so, global models build on many specialized models that address one
specific physical process. We thoroughly review the physics of the sub-models
included in global formation models. The sub-models can be classified as models
describing the protoplanetary disk (gas and solids), the (proto)planet (solid
core, gaseous envelope, and atmosphere), and finally the interactions
(migration and N-body interaction). We compare the approaches in different
global models and identify physical processes that require improved
descriptions in future. We then address important results of population
synthesis like the planetary mass function or the mass-radius relation. In
these results, the global effects of physical mechanisms occurring during
planet formation and evolution become apparent, and specialized models
describing them can be put to the observational test. Due to their nature as
meta models, global models depend on the development of the field of planet
formation theory as a whole. Because there are important uncertainties in this
theory, it is likely that global models will in future undergo significant
modifications. Despite this, they can already now yield many testable
predictions. With future global models addressing the geophysical
characteristics, it should eventually become possible to make predictions about
the habitability of planets.

that the properties of magnetized QSs generally depend on both the strength and
the orientation of the magnetic fields distributed inside the stars. Using a
density-dependent magnetic field profile which is introduced to mimic the
magnetic field strength distribution in a star, we study the properties of
static spherical QSs by assuming two extreme cases for the magnetic field
orientation in the stars, i.e., the radial orientation in which the local
magnetic fields are along the radial direction and the transverse orientation
in which the local magnetic fields are randomly oriented but perpendicular to
the radial direction. Our results indicate that including the magnetic fields
with radial (transverse) orientation can significantly decrease (increase) the
maximum mass of QSs, demonstrating the importance of the magnetic field
orientation inside the magnetized compact stars.

general theory for the fixation probability of a mutant in a population of

our theory to evolutionary games for which the payoff structure varies in time.
The mutant can exploit the environmental noise; a dynamic environment that
switches between two states can lead to a probability of fixation that is
higher than in any of the individual environmental states. We provide an
intuitive interpretation of this surprising effect. We also investigate
stationary distributions when mutations are present in the dynamics. In this

nonsymmetric linear systems with Bi-Conjugate Gradient (BiCG) algorithm, needs
only O(1) time (per BiCG iteration). We also extend this estimate to
approximate l2 norm of error vector using the relations of Hestenes and
Stiefel. Using the heuristics of numerical results we observe that the
developed algorithm (BiCGQL) is at least k/10 times more accurate than residue
vector based stopping criteria (where k is the condition number of the system).

identification and reconstruction of faults in pipelines. The design of such
diagnosis system is based on redundant relations and nonlinear observers,
taking into account faults in sensors, damages in pumps, and unknown
extractions. The proposed algorithm is developed based on a model described by
nonlinear equations of the fluid behavior in a pipeline, considering the
principles of conservation of mass and momentum. In order to distinguish among
different types of faults and to reconstruct their behavior, the diagnosis
system operates in stages. The first stage called detection & fault isolation
aims to isolate a fault symptom with a set of redundant relations deduced from
the analysis of the model in nominal conditions and assuming measurements of
the standard variables at the extremes of the pipeline. In the second stage
named fault reconstruction, nonlinear observation algorithms estimate the
temporal evolution of the isolated fault. The complete diagnosis system is
validated through a series of experiments in a hydraulic pilot pipeline of 200
[m].
