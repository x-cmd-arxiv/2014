OpenFOAM for a low Reynolds number ($Re_D=2000$) axisymmetric jet subject to
multiple zero net mass flux (ZNMF) actuators. First, parallel performance of
OpenFOAM is tested by performing a scaling study up to $2048$ processors on a
supercomputer of Flemish Supercomputer Center(VSC). Then, a method to improve
the parallel efficiency is proposed. The method is based on developing a hybrid
concept to calculate the statistical moments. This new concept combines
ensemble and time averaging in order to allow data sampling in parallel. The
motivation is obtaining a reduction in the walltime to collect turbulent
statistics which is observed to be the dominating part in the ZNMF controlled
jet flow. Employing this parallel statistical averaging approach in combination
with regular grid partitioning parallelism, allowed us conducting DNS cases on
$P=624$ processors with an overall speed-up of $S_e=540.56$ and a parallel
efficiency of $E_e=0.87$. The parallelization using only grid partitioning
exhibited inferior performance with $S_e=423.94$ and $E_e=0.68$. In addition to
develop a methodology to increase the parallel performance, we reduced the time
step cost of the existing unsteady solver as well. To this end, an incremental
projection method is implemented into OpenFOAM and a performance gain above
$30\%$ is realized.

dark matter is modeled as a perfect fluid that obeys an ideal gas equation of
state. As the black hole actually grows, the accretion rate of dark matter
corresponds to the black hole apparent horizon growth rate. We analyse cases
with infall velocity as high as $0.5c$ and an environment density of
$100M_{\odot}/\mathrm{pc}^3$, which are rather extreme conditions. Being the
radial flux the maximum accretion case, our results show that the accretion of
an ideal gas, eventually collisional dark matter, does not contribute
significantly to SMBH masses. This result favors models predicting SMBHs were
formed already with supermasses. We show that despite the fact that we are
solving the full general relativistic system, for the parameter space studied
our results are surprisingly similar to those obtained using the Bondi formula,
which somehow certifies its use as a good approximation of a fully evolving
space-time with spherical symmetry at short scales at least for dark matter
densities. Additionally, we study the density profile of the gas and find that
the presence of SMBHs redistributes the gas near the event horizon with a cuspy
profile, whereas beyond a small fraction of a parsec it is not-cuspy anymore.

the orientation of the system, the primary's mass-loss rate, and the ionizing
flux of the hot secondary. In this work we present the first steps towards
generating synthetic observations to compare with available and future HST/STIS

the interacting winds in $\eta$ Car. We use the SimpleX algorithm to
post-process the output from 3D SPH simulations and obtain the ionization
fractions of hydrogen and helium assuming three different mass-loss rates for
the primary star. The resultant ionization maps of both species constrain the
regions where the observed forbidden emission lines can form. Including
collisional ionization is necessary to achieve a better description of the
ionization states, especially in the areas shielded from the secondary's

phased array interferometer with multiple antennas distributed in Europe. It
provides discrete sets of Fourier components of the sky brightness. Recovering
the original brightness distribution with aperture synthesis forms an inverse
problem that can be solved by various deconvolution and minimization methods
Aims. Recent papers have established a clear link between the discrete nature
of radio interferometry measurement and the ""compressed sensing"" (CS) theory,
which supports sparse reconstruction methods to form an image from the measured
visibilities. Empowered by proximal theory, CS offers a sound framework for
efficient global minimization and sparse data representation using fast
algorithms. Combined with instrumental direction-dependent effects (DDE) in the
scope of a real instrument, we developed and validated a new method based on
this framework Methods. We implemented a sparse reconstruction method in the
standard LOFAR imaging tool and compared the photometric and resolution
performance of this new imager with that of CLEAN-based methods (CLEAN and
MS-CLEAN) with simulated and real LOFAR data Results. We show that i) sparse
reconstruction performs as well as CLEAN in recovering the flux of point
sources; ii) performs much better on extended objects (the root mean square
error is reduced by a factor of up to 10); and iii) provides a solution with an
effective angular resolution 2-3 times better than the CLEAN images.
Conclusions. Sparse recovery gives a correct photometry on high dynamic and
wide-field images and improved realistic structures of extended sources (of
simulated and real LOFAR datasets). This sparse reconstruction method is
compatible with modern interferometric imagers that handle DDE corrections (A-
and W-projections) required for current and future instruments such as LOFAR
and SKA

of the distance from the Galactic plane $Z$ to study their variation across the
Galactic disc. The RAVE sample exhibits a negative radial gradient of
$d[Fe/H]/dR=-0.054$ dex kpc$^{-1}$ close to the Galactic plane ($|Z|<0.4$ kpc)
that becomes flatter for larger $|Z|$. Other elements follow the same trend
although with some variations from element to element. The mock sample has
radial gradients in fair agreement with the observed data. The variation of the
gradients with $Z$ shows that the Fe radial gradient of the RAVE sample has
little change in the range $|Z|\lesssim0.6$ kpc and then flattens. The iron
vertical gradient of the RAVE sample is slightly negative close to the Galactic
plane and steepens with $|Z|$. The mock sample exhibits an iron vertical
gradient that is always steeper than the RAVE sample. The mock sample also
shows an excess of metal-poor stars in the [Fe/H] distributions with respect to
the observed data. These discrepancies can be reduced by decreasing the number
of thick disc stars and increasing their average metallicity in the Besan\c con

statistical physics describing particles that hop randomly from one site to the

ASEP has been used to model and analyze numerous multiagent systems with local

In ASEP with periodic boundary conditions a particle that hops from the last

referred to as the ribosome flow model on a ring (RFMR). We analyze the RFMR
using the theory of monotone dynamical systems. We show that it admits a
continuum of equilibrium points and that every trajectory converges to an
equilibrium point. Furthermore, we show that it entrains to periodic transition
rates between the sites. When all the transition rates are equal all the state
variables converge to the same value. Thus, the RFMR with homogeneous
transition rates is a nonlinear consensus algorithm. We describe an application

in Seyferts and quasars. In this work we extend the search for such Fe K
absorption lines to a larger sample of 26 radio-loud AGNs observed with
XMM-Newton and Suzaku. The sample is drawn from the Swift BAT 58-month catalog
and blazars are excluded. X-ray bright FR II radio galaxies constitute the

correcting for the number of spectra with insufficient signal-to-noise, we can
estimate that the incidence of UFOs is this sample of radio-loud AGNs is likely
in the range f=(50+/-20)%. A photo-ionization modeling of the absorption lines
with XSTAR allows to estimate the distribution of their main parameters. The
observed outflow velocities are broadly distributed between v_out<1,000 km s^-1

presence of complex accretion disk winds in a significant fraction of
radio-loud AGNs and demonstrate that the presence of relativistic jets does not
preclude the existence of winds, in accordance with several theoretical models.

uptake in a given placenta: (i) the maximal oxygen inflow of a placentone if
there were no tissue blocking the flow, and (ii) the ratio of transit time of
maternal blood through the intervillous space to oxygen extraction time. We
derive analytical formulas for fast and simple calculation of oxygen uptake and
provide two diagrams of efficiency of oxygen transport in an arbitrary
placental cross-section. We finally show that artificial perfusion experiments
with no-hemoglobin blood tend to give a two-orders-of-magnitude underestimation
of the in vivo oxygen uptake and that the optimal geometry for such setup
alters significantly. The theory allows one to adjust the results of artificial
placenta perfusion experiments to account for oxygen-hemoglobin dissociation.
Combined with image analysis techniques, the presented model can give an
easy-to-use tool for prediction of the human placenta efficiency.

in a wide frequency (7 - 55000 cm$^{-1}$) and temperature (2 to 300 K) range.
The optical spectra do not reveal any indication of a normal-state gap
formation. A Drude-like peak centered at zero frequency dominates the optical
conductivity below 150 K. At higher temperatures, it shifts to finite
frequencies. The detailed analysis of the low-frequency conductivity reveals
that the Drude peak and a far-infrared (FIR) peak centered at about 300

grow at the expense of the Drude spectral weight with increasing temperature.
The temperature dependence of the penetration depth follows a behavior typical
for $d$-wave superconductors. The absolute value of the penetration depth for
zero temperature is 1.6 $\mu$m, indicating a rather low density of the

the construction of (non-isometric) extensions of the maximal development which

peculiar ${}^1S_0$ state lies lower than the usual ${}^1S_0$ state, the
peculiar ${}^1S_0$ state can be produced by a two-photon decay of the usual

that extend from the solar surface into the chromosphere and the corona. These
so-called magnetic tornadoes are primarily detected as rings or spirals of
rotating plasma in the Ca II 854.2 nm line core (also known as chromospheric
swirls). Detailed numerical simulations show that the observed chromospheric
plasma motion is caused by the rotation of magnetic field structures, which
again are driven by photospheric vortex flows at their footpoints. Under the
right conditions, two vortex flow systems are stacked on top of each other. We
refer to the lower vortex, which extends from the low photosphere into the
convection zone, as intergranular vortex flow (IVF). Once a magnetic field
structure is co-located with an IVF, the rotation is mediated into the upper
atmospheric layers and an atmospheric vortex flow (AVF, or magnetic tornado) is
generated. In contrast to the recent work by Shelyag et al., we demonstrate
that particle trajectories in a simulated magnetic tornado indeed follow
spirals and argue that the properties of the trajectories decisively depend on
the location in the atmosphere and the strength of the magnetic field.

$\lambda_{r+1} \geq \Phi^{*}/(1-\delta)$. Their key idea is a rounding
technique that first maps a vector-valued solution to $[0, 1]$ using
appropriately scaled projections onto Lasserre vectors. In this paper, we show
that similar projections and analysis can be obtained using only $\ell_{2}^{2}$
triangle inequality constraints. This results in a $O(r/\delta^{2})$

$\ell_{2}^{2}$ triangle inequality constraints to the usual semidefinite

The {\it ensemble} of replicas evolves as to maximize the inter-replica

replica). We demonstrate how our method improves the performance of rudimentary
local optimization schemes long applied to the NP hard Traveling Salesman

geometrical coupling alone, we are able to determine for the optimum tour
length on systems up to $280$ cities (an order of magnitude larger than the
largest systems typically solved by the bare $k=3$ opt). The probabilistic
replica-based inference approach improves $k-opt$ even further and determines
the optimal solution of a problem with $318$ cities and find tours whose total

larger number of cities.

two radio relics have unusually flat integrated spectral indices of -0.49 +/-

discontinuities in the ICM. As expected, we detect a density discontinuity near
each of the radio relics. However, if these discontinuities are the shock
fronts that fuelled the radio emission, then their Mach numbers are
surprisingly low, both <=2. We studied the aperture of the density
discontinuities, and found that while the NW discontinuity spans the whole
length of the NW radio relic, the arc spanned by the SE discontinuity is
shorter than the arc spanned by the SE relic. This startling result is in
apparent contradiction with our current understanding of the origin of radio

the evolution of the faint-end slope of the stellar mass function of
star-forming galaxies, the logarithmic slope of the sSFR-mass relation and the
merging of galaxies. We derive analytically the consequences of the observed
constancy of the faint-end slope since redshifts of at least z ~ 2. If the
logarithmic slope of the sSFR-mass relation is negative, then the faint-end
slope should quickly diverge due to the differential mass increase of galaxies
on the star-forming main sequence, and this will also quickly destroy the
Schechter form of the mass function. This problem can be solved by removing low
mass galaxies by merging them into more massive galaxies. We quantify this
process by introducing the specific merger mass rate (sMMR) as the specific
rate of mass added to a given galaxy through mergers. For a modest negative
value of the logarithmic slope of the sSFR-mass relation of beta ~ -0.1, an
average sMMR ~ 0.1sSFR across the population is required to keep the faint-end
slope constant with epoch, as observed. This in turn implies a merger rate of ~
0.2sSFR for major mergers, which is consistent with the available observational
estimates. More negative values of beta require higher sMMR and higher merger
rates, and the steepening of the mass function becomes impossible to control
for beta < ~ -0.6, for an observed value of the faint-end slope of ~ -1.4. The
close link that is required between the in situ sSFR and the sMMR probably
arises because both are closely linked to the buildup of dark matter haloes.
These new findings further develop the formalism for the evolving galaxy
population that we introduced earlier, and show how striking symmetries in the
galaxy population can emerge as the result of deep links between the physical
processes involved.

a significant fraction (~5-40%) of their bolometric luminosity as Lyman Alpha
(Lya) line emission. However, neutral intergalactic gas that existed during the
EoR was opaque to Lya emission that escaped from galaxies during this epoch,
which makes it difficult to observe. The neutral intergalactic medium (IGM) may
thus reveal itself by suppressing the Lya flux from background galaxies.
Interestingly, a `sudden' reduction in the observed Lya flux has now been
observed in galaxies at z >6. This review contains a detailed summary of Lya
radiative processes: I describe (i) the main Lya emission processes, including
collisional-excitation & recombination (and derive the famous factor `0.68'),
and (ii) basic radiative transfer concepts, including e.g. partially coherent

thick versus 'extremely' optically thick (static/outflowing/collapsing) media,
and multiphase media. Following this review, I derive expressions for the
Gunn-Peterson optical depth of the IGM during (inhomogeneous) reionization and
post-reionization. I then describe why current observations appear to require a
very rapid evolution of volume-averaged neutral fraction of hydrogen in the
context of realistic inhomogeneous reionization models, and discuss
uncertainties in this interpretation. Finally, I describe how existing &
futures surveys and instruments can help reduce these uncertainties, and allow
us to fully exploit Lya emitting galaxies as a probe of the EoR.

external debris disc. This scenario could occur after planet-planet scattering
or merging events. We characterise the evolution over a wide range of initial
conditions, using a suite of n-body integrations combined with theory. Planets
near the disc mid-plane remove the inner debris region, and surviving particles
form an eccentric disc apsidally aligned with the planet. The inner disc edge
is elliptical and lies just beyond the planet's orbit. Moderately inclined
planets ($i_{\rm plt} \gtrsim 20^\circ$ for $e_{\rm plt} = 0.8$) may instead
sculpt debris into a bell-shaped structure enveloping the planet's orbit.
Finally some highly inclined planets ($i_{\rm plt} \sim 90^\circ$) can maintain
a disc orthogonal to the planet's plane. In all cases disc particles undergo
rapid evolution, whilst the overall structures evolve more slowly. The shapes
of these structures and their density profiles are characterised. The width of
the chaotic zone around the planet's orbit is derived in the coplanar case
using eccentric Hill radius arguments. This zone is cleared within
approximately ten secular or diffusion times (whichever is longer), and debris
assumes its final shape within a few secular times. We quantify the planet's
migration and show it will almost always be small in this mass regime. Our
results may be used to characterise unseen eccentric planets using observed
debris features.

the mass ratio is $q_{max}=m_1/m_2=0.623\pm0.038$, the smaller black-hole spin
is aligned with the orbital angular momentum, and the larger black-hole spin is
counteraligned ($\alpha_1=-\alpha_2=1$). This maximum recoil is about
$80\,km/s$ larger than previous estimates, but most importantly, because the
maximum occurs for smaller mass ratios, the probability for a merging binary to
recoil faster than $400\,km/s$ can be as large as $17\%$, while the probability

and the lowest Landau level enhance the tendency toward edge reconstruction. We
identify the bosonic and fermionic modes of edge excitations and obtain their
dispersions by back-calculating from the energy spectra as well as directly
from appropriate trial wave functions. We find that the edge reconstruction is
driven by an instability in the fermionic sector for setback distances close to
the critical ones. We also study the edge of the $\nu=7/3$ state and find that
edge reconstruction occurs here more readily than for the $\nu=1/3$ state. Our
study indicates that the $\nu=5/2$ and 7/3 edge states are reconstructed for
all experimental systems investigated so far and thus must be taken into
account when analyzing experimental results. We also consider an effective
field theory to gain insight into how edge reconstruction might influence
various observable quantities.

vacuum energy is favoured by current cosmological datasets. We characterize the
strength of the coupling by a dimensionless parameter $q_V$ that is free to
take different values in four redshift bins from the primordial epoch up to
today. This interacting scenario is in agreement with measurements of cosmic
microwave background temperature anisotropies from the Planck satellite,
supernovae Ia from Union 2.1 and redshift space distortions from a number of
surveys, as well as with combinations of these different datasets. We show that
a non-zero interaction is very likely at late times. We then focus on the case
$q_V\not=0$ in a single low-redshift bin, obtaining a nested one parameter
extension of the standard $\Lambda$CDM model. We study the Bayesian evidence,
with respect to $\Lambda$CDM, of this late-time interaction model, finding
moderate evidence for an interaction starting at $z=0.9$, dependent upon the
prior range chosen for the interaction strength parameter $q_V$. For this case
the null interaction ($q_V=0$, i.e.$\Lambda$CDM) is excluded at 99% c.l..

used for modelling real-life applications. An important performance measure to
evaluate in these applications is their steady-state behaviour, which is
determined by the stationary density. Computing it requires solving a
(nonsymmetric) M-matrix algebraic Riccati equation, and indeed computing the
stationary density is the most important application of this class of
equations.
  Xue, Xu and Li [Numer. Math., 2012] provided a componentwise first-order
perturbation analysis of this equation, proving that the solution can be
computed to high relative accuracy even in the smallest entries, and suggested
several algorithms for computing it. An important step in all proposed
algorithms is using so-called triplet representations, which are special
representations for M-matrices that allow for a high-accuracy variant of
Gaussian elimination, the GTH-like algorithm. However, triplet representations
for all the M-matrices needed in the algorithm were not found explicitly. This
can lead to an accuracy loss that prevents the algorithms to converge in the
componentwise sense.
  In this paper, we focus on the structured doubling algorithm, the most
efficient among the proposed methods in Xue et al., and build upon their
results, providing (i) explicit and cancellation-free expressions for the
needed triplet representations, allowing the algorithm to be performed in a
really cancellation-free fashion; (ii) an algorithm to evaluate the final part
of the computation to obtain the stationary density; and (iii) a componentwise
error analysis for the resulting algorithm, the first explicit one for this
class of algorithms. We also present numerical results to illustrate the

field theory. Gauge theories are of particular interest, but for these systems
the entanglement entropy is not clearly defined because the physical Hilbert
space does not factor as a tensor product according to regions of space. Here
we review a definition of entanglement entropy that applies to abelian and
nonabelian lattice gauge theories. This entanglement entropy is obtained by
embedding the physical Hilbert space into a product of Hilbert spaces
associated to regions with boundary. The latter Hilbert spaces include degrees
of freedom on the entangling surface that transform like surface charges under
the gauge symmetry. These degrees of freedom are shown to contribute to the
entanglement entropy, and the form of this contribution is determined by the
gauge symmetry. We test our definition using the example of two-dimensional
Yang-Mills theory, and find that it agrees with the thermal entropy in de
Sitter space, and with the results of the Euclidean replica trick. We discuss
the possible implications of this result for more complicated gauge theories,
including quantum gravity.

Higgs mass conformally symmetric. At the background level, the theory admits
novel geodesically-complete cyclic cosmological solutions characterized by a
brief period of repulsive gravity, or ""antigravity"", during each successive
transition from a Big Crunch to a Big Bang. We show that despite the

rendered using texture mapping.
  We describe a search-based texture synthesis algorithm in which samples can

The key to our algorithm is a pyramidal representation in which each texture
sample depends only on a fixed number of neighboring samples at each level of
the pyramid. The bottom (coarsest) level of the pyramid consists of a noise
image, which is small and predetermined. When a sample is requested by the
renderer, all samples on which it depends are generated at once. Using this
approach, samples can be generated in any order. To make the algorithm
efficient, we propose storing texture samples and their dependents in a
pyramidal cache. Although the first few samples are expensive to generate,
there is substantial reuse, so subsequent samples cost less. Fortunately, most
rendering algorithms exhibit good coherence, so cache reuse is high.

to systems of equalities and inequalities by Leventhal and Lewis. Even more
recently, Needell and Tropp provided an analysis of a block version of the
method for systems of linear equations. This paper considers the use of a block
type method for systems of mixed equalities and inequalities, bridging these
two bodies of work. We show that utilizing a matrix paving over the equalities
of the system can lead to significantly improved convergence, and prove a
linear convergence rate as in the standard block method. We also demonstrate
that using blocks of inequalities offers similar improvement only when the
system satisfies a certain geometric property. We support the theoretical
analysis with several experimental results.

By solving the Boltzmann transport equation (BTE) with ab initio phonon
dispersions and scattering rates, we reveal a transport regime with fractal
space dimension $1 < \alpha < 2$ and superlinear time evolution of mean square
energy displacement $\sigma^2(t) \sim t^{\beta} (1 < \beta < 2)$. The
characteristic exponents are directly interconnected with the order $n$ of the

(\tau;\Lambda)^{\gamma}$ resolved for relaxation times or mean free paths
through simple relations $\alpha = 3-\beta = 1 + 3/n = 2 - \gamma$. The
quasi-ballistic transport inside alloys is no longer governed by Brownian
motion, but instead dominated by L\'evy dynamics. This has important
implications for the interpretation of thermoreflectance (TR) measurements with
modified Fourier theory. Experimental $\alpha$ values for InGaAs and SiGe,

retaining all essential physics of the quasi-ballistic BTE dynamics
phenomenologically. A stochastic process with just two fitting parameters
describes the transition from pure L\'evy superdiffusion as short length and
time scales to regular Fourier diffusion. The model provides accurate fits to
time domain thermoreflectance raw experimental data over the full modulation

plug-in noise filtering using sector-based clustering, an efficient geometric

hence, the chemistry is sensitive to the photodissociation of N$_2$ and CO,

photodissociation of N$_2$ has recently been quantified by laboratory and
theoretical studies. Improvements have also been made for CO photodissociation.
For the first time, we use accurate N$_2$ and CO photodissociation rates and
shielding functions in a model of the circumstellar envelope of the carbon-rich
AGB star, IRC +10216. We use a state-of-the-art chemical model of an AGB
envelope, the latest CO and N$_2$ photodissociation data, and a new method for
implementing molecular shielding functions in full spherical geometry with
isotropic incident radiation. We compare computed column densities and radial
distributions of molecules with observations. The transition of N$_2$ $\to$ N
(also, CO $\to$ C $\to$ C$^+$) is shifted towards the outer envelope relative
to previous models. This leads to different column densities and radial
distributions of N-bearing species, especially those species whose
formation/destruction processes largely depend on the availability of atomic or
molecular nitrogen, for example, C$_n$N ($n$=1, 3, 5), C$_n$N$^-$ ($n$=1, 3,
5), HC$_n$N ($n$=1, 3, 5, 7, 9), H$_2$CN and CH$_2$CN. The chemistry of many
species is directly or indirectly affected by the photodissociation of N$_2$
and CO, especially in the outer shell of AGB stars where photodissociation is
important. Thus, it is important to include N$_2$ and CO shielding in
astrochemical models of AGB envelopes and other irradiated environments. In
general, while differences remain between our model of IRC +10216 and the
observed molecular column densities, better agreement is found between the
calculated and observed radii of peak abundance.

periods and down to terrestrial sizes. While the majority of the target stars
are main-sequence dwarfs of spectral type F, G, and K, Kepler covers stars with
effective temperature as low as 2500 K, which corresponds to M stars. These
cooler stars allow characterization of small planets near the habitable zone,
yet it is not clear if this population is representative of that around FGK
stars. In this paper, we calculate the occurrence of planets around stars of
different spectral types as a function of planet radius and distance from the
star, and show that they are significantly different from each other. We
further identify two trends: First, the occurrence of Earth to Neptune-sized
planets is successively higher toward later spectral types at all orbital
periods probed by Kepler; Planets around M stars occur twice as frequently as
around G stars, and thrice as frequently as around F stars. Second, a drop in
planet occurrence is evident at all spectral types inward of a 10 day orbital
period, with a plateau further out. By assigning to each spectral type a median
stellar mass, we show that the distance from the star where this drop occurs is
stellar mass dependent, and scales with semi-major axis as the cube root of
stellar mass. By comparing different mechanisms of planet formation, trapping
and destruction, we find that this scaling best matches the location of the
pre-main-sequence co-rotation radius, indicating efficient trapping of
migrating planets or planetary building blocks. These results demonstrate the
stellar-mass dependence of the planet population, both in terms of occurrence
rate and of orbital distribution. The prominent stellar-mass dependence of the
inner boundary of the planet population shows that the formation or migration
of planets is sensitive to the stellar parameters.

diagrams leads to sizable contributions to the rapidity correlation functions
of the order of $\sigma_{in} /\Lb \pi R^2\Rb$ where $\sigma_{in}$ is the
inelastic cross section and $R$ is the size of the typical dipole inside the
proton saturation scale. Therefore, the correlations do not depend on the
saturation scale. We demonstrated that density variation mechanism does not
lead to suppression of the angular dependance of the double inclusive cross
section generating the coefficient in front of $\cos^2 \varphi$ in $A^{1/3}$
larger in the case of hadron-nucleus collision than in hadron-hadron

  with a low false positive rate requirement and limited training data","IEEE/IAPR International Joint Conference on Biometrics, 2014",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper we address the problem of matching patterns in the so-called
verification setting in which a novel, query pattern is verified against a
single training pattern: the decision sought is whether the two match (i.e.
belong to the same class) or not. Unlike previous work which has universally
focused on the development of more discriminative distance functions between
patterns, here we consider the equally important and pervasive task of
selecting a distance threshold which fits a particular operational requirement
- specifically, the target false positive rate (FPR). First, we argue on
theoretical grounds that a data-driven approach is inherently ill-conditioned
when the desired FPR is low, because by the very nature of the challenge only a
small portion of training data affects or is affected by the desired threshold.
This leads us to propose a general, statistical model-based method instead. Our
approach is based on the interpretation of an inter-pattern distance as
implicitly defining a pattern embedding which approximately distributes
patterns according to an isotropic multi-variate normal distribution in some
space. This interpretation is then used to show that the distribution of
training inter-pattern distances is the non-central chi2 distribution,
differently parameterized for each class. Thus, to make the class-specific
threshold choice we propose a novel analysis-by-synthesis iterative algorithm
which estimates the three free parameters of the model (for each class) using
task-specific constraints. The validity of the premises of our work and the
effectiveness of the proposed method are demonstrated by applying the method to
the task of set-based face verification on a large database of pseudo-random
head motion videos.

the ratio of capacity (e.g., the number of parameters) to computation is very
favorable (up to exponentially more parameters than computation), the ratio is
essentially 1 for deep neural networks. Conditional computation has been
proposed as a way to increase the capacity of a deep neural network without
increasing the amount of computation required, by activating some parameters
and computation ""on-demand"", on a per-example basis. In this note, we propose a
novel parametrization of weight matrices in neural networks which has the
potential to increase up to exponentially the ratio of the number of parameters
to computation. The proposed approach is based on turning on some parameters
(weight matrices) when specific bit patterns of hidden unit activations are
obtained. In order to better control for the overfitting that might result, we
propose a parametrization that is tree-structured, where each node of the tree
corresponds to a prefix of a sequence of sign bits, or gating units, associated

reversal, charge conjugation, and magnetic translations, operator $K$-theory is
more general and natural than the commutative topological theory. Our approach
is model-independent, and only the symmetry data of the dynamics, which may
include information about disorder, is required. This data is completely
encoded in a suitable $C^*$-superalgebra. From a representation-theoretic point
of view, symmetry-compatible gapped phases are classified by the
super-representation group of this symmetry algebra. Contrary to existing
literature, we do not use $K$-theory to classify phases in an absolute sense,
but only relative to some arbitrary reference. $K$-theory groups are better
thought of as groups of obstructions between homotopy classes of gapped phases.
Besides rectifying various inconsistencies in the existing literature on
$K$-theory classification schemes, our treatment has conceptual simplicity in
its treatment of all symmetries equally. The Periodic Table of Kitaev is
exhibited as a special case within our framework, and we prove that the
phenomena of periodicity and dimension shifts are robust against disorder and

particularly interesting case where Cd substitution induces long-range magnetic
order, as in Zn-doped copper-oxides. Applied pressure globally supresses the
Cd-induced magnetic order and restores bulk superconductivity. Here we show,
however, that local magnetic correlations, whose spatial extent decreases with
applied pressure, persist at the extrapolated QCP. The residual droplets of
impurity-induced magnetic moments prevent the reappearance of conventional
signatures of quantum criticality, but induce a heterogeneous electronic state.
These discoveries show that spin droplets can be a source of electronic
heterogeneity in classes of strongly correlated electron systems and emphasize

approach the capacity of an arbitrary discrete memoryless channel. In
particular, we take the point of view of modern coding theory and discuss how
recent advances in coding for symmetric channels help provide more efficient
solutions for the asymmetric case. We consider, in more detail, three basic
coding paradigms.
  The first one is Gallager's scheme that consists of concatenating a linear
code with a non-linear mapping so that the input distribution can be
appropriately shaped. We explicitly show that both polar codes and spatially
coupled codes can be employed in this scenario. Furthermore, we derive a
scaling law between the gap to capacity, the cardinality of the input and
output alphabets, and the required size of the mapper.
  The second one is an integrated scheme in which the code is used both for
source coding, in order to create codewords distributed according to the
capacity-achieving input distribution, and for channel coding, in order to
provide error protection. Such a technique has been recently introduced by
Honda and Yamamoto in the context of polar codes, and we show how to apply it
also to the design of sparse graph codes.
  The third paradigm is based on an idea of B\""ocherer and Mathar, and
separates the two tasks of source coding and channel coding by a chaining
construction that binds together several codewords. We present conditions for
the source code and the channel code, and we describe how to combine any source
code with any channel code that fulfill those conditions, in order to provide
capacity-achieving schemes for asymmetric channels. In particular, we show that
polar codes, spatially coupled codes, and homophonic codes are suitable as
basic building blocks of the proposed coding strategy.

stars. We find that for the fastest rotating and most relativistic polytropic
models, the deviation from full general relativity is below 5% for integrated
quantities and below 10% for local quantities, such as the angular velocity.
Furthermore, we study the deviation of the IWM-CFC approximation from full
general relativity by evaluating and comparing different error indicators. We
find that for the models that are not near the maximum mass, a simple error
indicator constructed from local values of the metric potentials is more
indicative of the accuracy of the IWM-CFC approximation than an error indicator
that is based on the Cotton-York tensor. Furthermore, we construct a simple,
linear empirical relation that allows for the estimation of the error made by
the IWM-CFC approximation and which only involves the flattening of the star
due to rotation and the minimum value of the lapse function. Thus, in any
numerical simulation involving rotating relativistic stars, one can readily

dissipative forces that mimic the effects of gas-driven (Type II) migration. It
has been shown that, in the planar case, migration leads to resonant capture
after an evolution that forces the system to follow families of periodic
orbits. Starting with planets that differ slightly from a coplanar
configuration, capture can, also, occur and, additionally, excitation of
planetary inclinations has been observed in some cases. We show that excitation
of inclinations occurs, when the planar families of periodic orbits, which are
followed during the initial stages of planetary migration, become vertically
unstable. At these points, {\em vertical critical orbits} may give rise to
generating stable families of $3D$ periodic orbits, which drive the evolution
of the migrating planets to non-coplanar motion. We have computed and present
here the vertical critical orbits of the $2/1$ and $3/1$ resonances, for
various values of the planetary mass ratio. Moreover, we determine the limiting
values of eccentricity for which the ""inclination resonance"" occurs.

most popular platforms on the Internet, on which millions of users register to
share personal information with their friends. A large amount of data, social
links and statistics about users are collected by Online Social Networks
services and they create big digital mines of various statistical data. Leakage
of personal information is a significant concern for social network users.
Besides information propagation, some new attacks on Online Social Networks
such as Identity Clone attack (ICA) have been identified. ICA attempts to
create a fake online identity of a victim to fool their friends into believing
the authenticity of the fake identity to establish social links in order to
reap the private information of the victims friends which is not shared in
their public profiles. There are some identity validation services that perform
users identity validation, but they are passive services and they only protect
users who are informed on privacy concerns and online identity issues. This
paper starts with an explanation of two types of profile cloning attacks are
explained and a new approach for detecting clone identities is proposed by
defining profile similarity and strength of relationship measures. According to
similar attributes and strength of relationship among users which are computed
in detection steps, it will be decided which profile is clone and which one is
genuine by a predetermined threshold. Finally, the experimental results are
presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

enlarge the sample of protoplanetary disks imaged in polarized light with

the use of graph analysis in translational neuroscience has become essential to
quantify brain dysfunctions in terms of aberrant reconfiguration of functional

networks is not a simple toolbox that can be blindly applied to brain signals.

place bounds on the change that has occurred in the electromagnetic fine
structure constant $\alpha$ over the last 2 billion years. Alternatively, an
analysis could be based on a recently proposed expression for shifts in
resonance energies which relates them to changes in both $\alpha$ and the
average $m_q$ of the $u$ and $d$ current quark masses, and which makes explicit
the dependence on mass number $A$ and atomic number $Z$. (Recent model
independent results on hadronic $\sigma$-terms suggest sensitivity to the
strange quark mass is negligible.) The most sophisticated analysis, to date, of
the quark mass term invokes a calculation of the nuclear mean-field within the
Walecka model of quantum hadrodynamics. We comment on this study and consider
an alternative in which the link to low-energy quantum chromodynamics (QCD) and
its pattern of chiral symmetry-breaking is more readily discernible.
Specifically, we investigate the sensitivity to changes in the pion mass
$M_\pi$ of a single nucleon potential determined by an in-medium chiral
perturbation theory ($\chi$PT) calculation which includes virtual
$\mathrm{\Delta}$-excitations. Subject to some reasonable assumptions about
low-energy constants (LECs), we confirm that the $m_q$-contribution to
resonance shifts is enhanced by a factor of 10 or so relative to the
$\alpha$-term and deduce that the Oklo data for Sm imply that
$|m_q(\mathrm{Oklo})- m_q(\mathrm{now})| \lesssim 10^{-9}m_q(\mathrm{now})$.

cancellation/alignment motivates us to force the D2D users near the base
stations to work in cellular mode. Based on that, we present a distributed and

between decreasing interference penalty to base stations and improving spectrum

framework reveal that enabling D2D communication does improve the per user
throughput and that a proper guard zone can further significantly increase the
average throughput of both kinds of users. Thanks to the tractability of our

efficiently obtained by finding the root of the first order derivative of the
throughput expression. Through extensive numerical analysis, we show insights

two-dimensional quantum spin Hall insulating phase to a three-dimensional
strong topological insulator by tuning the hopping between the layers. We
further show that additional Hubbard onsite interactions can give rise to spin
liquid-like phases: weak and strong topological Mott insulators. They represent
the celebrated paradigm of a quantum state of matter which merely exists
because of the interplay of the non-trivial topology of the band structure and
strong interactions. While the theoretical understanding of this phase has
remained elusive, our proposal shall help to shed some light on this exotic
state of matter by paving the way for a controlled experimental investigation
in optical lattices.

constraints, to be used for translating decision problems into SAT problems
(i.e., deciding satisfiability for conjunctive normal forms). We apply it to
the representation of systems of XOR-constraints, also known as systems of
linear equations over the two-element field, or systems of parity constraints.
  The general framework defines the notion of ""representation"", and provides
several methods to measure the quality of the representation by the complexity
(""hardness"") needed for making implicit ""knowledge"" of the representation
explicit (to a SAT-solving mechanism). We obtain general upper and lower
bounds.
  Applied to systems of XOR-constraints, we show a super-polynomial lower bound
on ""good"" representations under very general circumstances. A corresponding
upper bound shows fixed-parameter tractability in the number of constraints.
  The measurement underlying this upper bound ignores the auxiliary variables
needed for shorter representations of XOR-constraints. Improved upper bounds
(for special cases) take them into account, and a rich picture begins to
emerge, under the various hardness measurements.

$Z(3)$ symmetry, which lifts the degeneracy of the $Z(3)$ vacua arising from
spontaneous breaking of the $Z(3)$ symmetry in the quark-gluon plasma (QGP)
phase. Resulting domain walls have asymmetric profile of $l(x)$ (under
reflection $x \rightarrow -x$ for a domain wall centered at the origin). We
calculate the background gauge field profile $A_0$ associated with this domain
wall profile. Interestingly, even with the asymmetric $l(x)$ profile,
quark-antiquark scattering from the corresponding gauge field configuration
does not reflect this asymmetry. We show that the expected asymmetry in
scattering arises when we include the effect of asymmetric profile of $l(x)$ on
the effective mass of quarks and antiquarks and calculate resultant scattering.

this study the effect of the large strain on the properties of VO2 films was
investigated. One remarkable result is that highly strained epitaxial VO2 thin

These highly strained VO2 films underwent an electronic phase transition
without the concomitant Peierls transition. Our results also show that a very
large tensile strain along the c-axis of rutile VO2 resulted in a phase
transition temperature of ~ 433 K, much higher than in any previous report. Our

subcell limiter technique for the Discontinuous Galerkin finite element method
for nonlinear systems of hyperbolic conservation laws in multiple space
dimensions that works well for arbitrary high order of accuracy in space and
time and that does not destroy the natural subcell resolution properties of the
DG method. High order time discretization is achieved via a one-step ADER
approach that uses a local space-time discontinuous Galerkin predictor method.
Our new limiting strategy is based on the so-called MOOD paradigm, which
aposteriori verifies the validity of a discrete candidate solution against
physical and numerical detection criteria. Within the DG scheme on the main
grid, the discrete solution is represented by piecewise polynomials of degree
N. For those troubled cells that need limiting, our new limiter approach
recomputes the discrete solution by scattering the DG polynomials at the
previous time step onto a set of N_s=2N+1 finite volume subcells per space
dimension. A robust but accurate ADER-WENO finite volume scheme then updates
the subcell averages of the conservative variables within the detected troubled
cells. The choice of N_s=2N+1 subcells is optimal since it allows to match the
maximum admissible time step of the finite volume scheme on the subgrid with

illustrate the performance of the new scheme via the simulation of numerous
test cases in two and three space dimensions, using DG schemes of up to tenth
order of accuracy in space and time (N=9). The method is also able to run on
massively parallel large scale supercomputing infrastructure, which is shown
via one 3D test problem that uses 10 billion space-time degrees of freedom per
time step.

on Diverse Subjects of Physics and Philosophy. Much has been written about
Euler and his work, but we wonder, who was the princess? How did she become
involved with the greatest mathematician of her time? The princess was a
fifteen year old named Friederike Charlotte von Brandenburg-Schwedt. In this
article we explore her story and the nature of the letters.

of current interest. We propose an immunization strategy for seasonal epidemics
that occur periodically. Based on the local information of the infection status
from the previous epidemic season, the selection of vaccinated nodes is
optimized gradually. The evolution of vaccinated nodes during iterations
demonstrates that the immunization tends to locate in both global hubs and
local hubs. We analyze the epidemic prevalence by a heterogeneous mean-field
method and present numerical simulations of our model. This immunization
performs superiorly to some other previously known strategies. Our work points
out a new direction in immunization of seasonal epidemics.

very little has been done in the acquisition of stellar abundance gradients in
the same regions. We present here a comparative study of the stellar
metallicity and age distributions in a sample of 62 nearly face-on, spiral
galaxies with and without bars, using data from the CALIFA survey. We measure
the slopes of the gradients and study their relation with other properties of
the galaxies. We find that the mean stellar age and metallicity gradients in
the disc are shallow and negative. Furthermore, when normalized to the
effective radius of the disc, the slope of the stellar population gradients
does not correlate with the mass or with the morphological type of the
galaxies. Contrary to this, the values of both age and metallicity at $\sim$2.5
scale-lengths correlate with the central velocity dispersion in a similar
manner to the central values of the bulges, although bulges show, on average,
older ages and higher metallicities than the discs. One of the goals of the
present paper is to test the theoretical prediction that non-linear coupling
between the bar and the spiral arms is an efficient mechanism for producing
radial migrations across significant distances within discs. The process of
radial migration should flatten the stellar metallicity gradient with time and,
therefore, we would expect flatter stellar metallicity gradients in barred
galaxies. However, we do not find any difference in the metallicity or age
gradients in galaxies with without bars. We discuss possible scenarios that can
lead to this absence of difference.

  Technique","16 pages,14 figures",,,,"cs.SY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Power systems are usually large non-linear systems, which are often subjected
to low frequency electromechanical oscillations. Power System Stabilizers are
often used as effective and economic means for damping the generator's
electromechanical oscillations and enhance the overall stability of power
systems. Power system stabilizers have been applied for several decades in
utilities and they can extend power transfer stability limits by adding
modulation signal through excitation control system. Sliding mode control is
one of the main methods employed to overcome the uncertainty of the system.
This controller can be applied very well in presence of both parameter
uncertainties and unknown nonlinear function such as disturbance. To enhance
stability and improve dynamic response of the system operating in faulty
conditions a Fuzzy based Sliding Mode Control Power System Stabiliser is
developed for a multimachine system with two generators and it is compared with
the Conventional Power System Stabiliser, Fuzzy based Power System Stabiliser,
Sliding Mode based Power System Stabiliser.

learning approaches including support vectors machines (SVM) and na\""ive bayes
(NB). We define two feature vector sets based on mel frequency cepstral
coefficients (MFCC) and relative spectral perceptual linear predictive
coefficients (RASTA-PLP). Each feature is modeled using the Gaussian Mixture
Model (GMM). Several ways of combining these information sources give
significant improvements in a text-independent speaker identification task

presented as an alternative to the traditional sinc function approach.
Numerical integration shows that this methodology is efficient and practical.
Applying the incomplete cosine expansion we obtain a rational approximation of
the complex error function that with the same number of the summation terms
provides an accuracy exceeding the Weideman\text{'}s approximation accuracy by
several orders of the magnitude. Application of the expansion results in an
integration consisting of elementary function terms only. Consequently, this
approach can be advantageous for accurate and rapid computation.
