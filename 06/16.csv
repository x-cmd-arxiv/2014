the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) with isotropic Gaussian statistics. All
measurements support the standard theory, except for a few anomalies discovered
in the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe maps and confirmed recently by the
Planck satellite. The Cold Spot is one of the most significant of such
anomalies, and the leading explanation of it posits a large void that imprints
this extremely cold area via the linear Integrated Sachs-Wolfe (ISW) effect due
to the decay of gravitational potentials over cosmic time, or via the
Rees-Sciama (RS) effect due to late-time non-linear evolution. Despite several
observational campaigns targeting the Cold Spot region, to date no suitably
large void was found at higher redshifts $z > 0.3$. Here we report the
detection of an $R =(192 \pm 15) h^{-1}Mpc$ size supervoid of depth $\delta =
-0.13 \pm 0.03$, and centred at redshift $z = 0.22$. This supervoid, possibly
the largest ever found, is large enough to significantly affect the CMB via the
non-linear RS effect, as shown in our Lemaitre-Tolman-Bondi framework. This
discovery presents the first plausible explanation for any of the physical CMB
anomalies, and raises the possibility that local large-scale structure could be
responsible for other anomalies as well.

time. This is a major obstacle in the search for a quantum theory of gravity,
where the causal structure of space-time is expected to be dynamical and
fundamentally probabilistic in character. Here, we propose a generalized
formulation of quantum theory without predefined time or causal structure,
building upon a recently introduced operationally time-symmetric approach to
quantum theory. The key idea is a novel isomorphism between transformations and
states which depends on the symmetry transformation of time reversal. This
allows us to express the time-symmetric formulation in a time-neutral form with
a clear physical interpretation, and ultimately drop the assumption of time. In
the resultant generalized formulation, operations are associated with regions
that can be connected in networks with no directionality assumed for the
connections, generalizing the standard circuit framework and the process matrix
framework for operations without global causal order. The possible events in a
given region are described by positive semidefinite operators on a Hilbert
space at the boundary, while the connections between regions are described by
entangled states that encode a nontrivial symmetry and could be tested in
principle. We discuss how the causal structure of space-time could be
understood as emergent from properties of the operators on the boundaries of
compact space-time regions. The framework is compatible with indefinite causal
order, timelike loops, and other acausal structures.

estimated than the conventional PCA if the projection is genuine, or more
precisely, when the factor loading matrices are related to the projected linear
space. When the dimensionality is large, the factors can be estimated
accurately even when the sample size is finite. We propose a flexible
semiparametric factor model, which decomposes the factor loading matrix into
the component that can be explained by subject-specific covariates and the
orthogonal residual component. The covariates' effects on the factor loadings
are further modeled by the additive model via sieve approximations. By using
the newly proposed Projected-PCA, the rates of convergence of the smooth factor
loading matrices are obtained, which are much faster than those of the
conventional factor analysis. The convergence is achieved even when the sample
size is finite and is particularly appealing in the
high-dimension-low-sample-size situation. This leads us to developing
nonparametric tests on whether observed covariates have explaining powers on
the loadings and whether they fully explain the loadings. The proposed method
is illustrated by both simulated data and the returns of the components of the

candidates. In this thesis, using numerical simulation, we rigorously prove
some of the conjectures of the TCAF model. In the work presented in this

simulated using a Monte Carlo code. These two codes are then coupled and the
resulting localized heating and cooling are included in the coupled code. Using

The SmartRescue project takes advantage of smartphone sensing, processing and
communication capabilities to monitor hazards and track people in a disaster.
The goal is to help crisis managers and members of the public in early hazard
detection, prediction, and in devising risk-minimizing evacuation plans when
disaster strikes. In this paper we suggest a novel smartphone-based
communication framework. It uses specific machine learning techniques that
intelligently process sensor readings into useful information for the crisis
responders. Core to the framework is a content-based publish-subscribe
mechanism that allows flexible sharing of sensor data and computation results.
We also evaluate a preliminary implementation of the platform, involving a
smartphone app that reads and shares mobile phone sensor data for activity
recognition.

candidates for time of flight positron emission tomography (PET). Discrete
readout schemes mitigate the low-noise requirements of analog schemes and offer
very fine control over threshold levels and timing pickup strategies. A high
optical fill factor is paramount to timing performance in such detectors, and
consequently space is limited for closely integrated electronics. Nonetheless,
a production, daily used PET scanner must minimize bandwidth usage, data
volume, data analysis time and power consumption and therefore requires a
real-time readout and data processing architecture as close to the detector as
possible. We propose a fully digital, embedded real-time readout architecture
for SPAD-based detector. The readout circuit is located directly under the SPAD
array instead of within or beside it to remove the fill factor versus circuit
capabilities tradeoff. The overall real-time engine reduces transmitted data by
a factor of 8 in standard operational mode. Combined with small local memory
buffers, this significantly reduces overall acquisition dead time. A prototype
device featuring individual readout for 6 scintillator channels was fabricated.
Timing readout is provided by a first photon discriminator and a 31 ps time to
digital discriminator, while energy reading and event packaging is done using
standard logic in real-time. The dedicated serial output line supports a
sustained rate of 170k counts per second (CPS) in waveform mode, while the
standard operational mode supports 2.2 MCPS.

using adaptive smoothing kernel, (ii) projected distance, $r_p$, to the nearest
neighbor galaxy and (iii) the morphology of the nearest neighbor galaxy as
various definitions of environment parameters of every galaxy in our sample. In
order to detect long-range interaction effects we divide galaxy interactions
into four cases depending on morphology of target and neighbor galaxies. This
study builds upon an earlier study by Park & Choi (2009) by including improved
definitions of target and neighbor galaxies thus enabling us to better
understand the effect of ""the nearest neighbor"" interaction on target galaxy.
We report that the impact of interaction on galaxy properties is detectable at
least out to the pair separation corresponding to the virial radius of (the
neighbor) galaxies. This turn out to be mostly between 210 and 360 $h^{-1}$kpc
for galaxies included in our study. We report that early type fraction, for
isolated galaxies with $r_p > r_{vir,nei}$ are almost ignorant of the
background density and, has a very weak density dependence for closed pairs.
Star formation activity of a a galaxy is found to be crucially dependent on
neighbor galaxy morphology. We find star formation activity parameters and
structure parameters of galaxies to be independent of the large scale
background density. We also exhibit that changing the absolute magnitude of the
neighbor galaxies does not affect significantly the star formation activity of

finite element method (xSBFEM)~\cite{natarajansong2013} to study fracture
parameters of interfacial cracks and cracks terminating at the interface. The
approach is also applied to crack growth along the interface and crack
deflecting into the material within the context of linear elastic fracture
mechanics. Apart from the stress intensity factors, the T-stress can be
computed directly from the definitions, without any requirement of path
independent integrals. The method aims at improving the capability of the
extended finite element method in treating crack tip singularities of cracks at
interfaces. An optimum size of the scaled boundary region is presented for
multimaterial junctions. The proposed method: (1) does not require special
numerical integration technique; (2) does not require a priori knowledge of the
asymptotic fields and (3) the stiffness of the region containing the crack tip
is computed directly. The robustness of the proposed approach is demonstrated
with a few examples in the context of linear elastic fracture mechanics. A
discussion on the crack growth along the interface and crack deflecting into
the material is also presented.

used for studying cosmic magnetism. But their potential for exploring the
intergalactic magnetic field (IGMF) in filaments of galaxies is unclear, since
other Faraday-rotation media such as the radio source itself, intervening
galaxies, and the interstellar medium of our Galaxy are all significant
contributors. We study statistical techniques for discriminating the Faraday
rotation of filaments from other sources of Faraday rotation in future
large-scale surveys of radio polarization. We consider a 30 degree times 30
degree field-of-view toward the south Galactic pole, while varying the number
of sources detected in both present and future observations. We select sources
located at high redshifts and toward which depolarization and optical
absorption systems are not observed, so as to reduce the RM contributions from
the sources and intervening galaxies. It is found that a high-pass filter can
satisfactorily reduce the RM contribution from the Galaxy, since the angular
scale of this component toward high Galactic latitudes would be much larger
than that expected for the IGMF. Present observations do not yet provide a
sufficient source density to be able to estimate the RM of filaments. However,
from the proposed approach with forthcoming surveys, we predict significant
residuals of RM that should be ascribable to filaments. The predicted structure
of the IGMF down to scales of 0.1 degree should be observable with data from
the SKA, if we achieve selections of sources toward which sight lines do not
contain intervening galaxies and RM errors are less than a few rad m-2.

orthorhombic SrIrO3 is a semimetal oxide. However, linear Hall effect and
insensitive-temperature-dependent resistance are observed in SrIrO3 films grown
on (La,Sr)(Al,Ta)O3 (LSAT) substrates, suggesting a tunable semimetallic state
due to band structure change in SrIrO3 films under different compressive

strain-state analysis by reciprocal space mapping and electron diffraction,
carrier density and mobility calculations, as well as electronic band structure
evolution under compressive strain (predicted by tight-binding approximation).
It might suggest that the strain-induced band shift leads to the semimetallic

conducting a fast similarity search is to transform the feature vectors into
binary vectors and perform the similarity search by using the Hamming distance.
Such a transformation is a hashing method, and the choice of hashing function
is important. Hashing methods using hyperplanes or hyperspheres are proposed.
One study reported here is inspired by Spherical LSH, and we use hypersperes to
hash the feature vectors. Our method, called Eclipse-hashing, performs a
compactification of R^n by using the inverse stereographic projection, which is
a kind of Alexandrov compactification. By using Eclipse-hashing, one can obtain
the hypersphere-hash function without explicitly using hyperspheres. Hence, the
number of nonlinear operations is reduced and the processing time of hashing
becomes shorter. Furthermore, we also show that as a result of improving the
approximation accuracy, Eclipse-hashing is more accurate than
hyperplane-hashing.

robust speech features for supervised learning with small sample complexity as
a problem of learning representations of the signal that are maximally
invariant to intraclass transformations and deformations. We propose an
extension of a theory for unsupervised learning of invariant visual
representations to the auditory domain and empirically evaluate its validity
for voiced speech sound classification. Our version of the theory requires the
memory-based, unsupervised storage of acoustic templates -- such as specific
phones or words -- together with all the transformations of each that normally
occur. A quasi-invariant representation for a speech segment can be obtained by
projecting it to each template orbit, i.e., the set of transformed signals, and
computing the associated one-dimensional empirical probability distributions.
The computations can be performed by modules of filtering and pooling, and
extended to hierarchical architectures. In this paper, we apply a single-layer,

grid. It was discovered that the well known quadrupolar structure in the
out-of-plane magnetic field gains four additional regions of opposite magnetic
polarity, emerging near the corners of the simulation box, moving towards the
$X$-point. The emerging, outer, magnetic field structure has opposite polarity
to the inner quadrupolar structure, leading to an overall octupolar structure.
Using Ampere's law and integrating electron and ion currents, defined at grid
cells, over the simulation domain, contributions to the out-of-plane magnetic
field from electron and ion currents were determined. The emerging regions of
opposite magnetic polarity were shown to be the result of ion currents.
Magnetic octupolar structure is found to be a signature of $X$-point collapse,
rather than tearing mode, and factors relating to potential discoveries in
experimental scenarios or space-craft observations are discussed.

5-38um of 244 LIRG nuclei. The detailed fits and high quality spectra allow for
characterization of the individual PAH features, warm molecular hydrogen
emission, and optical depths for silicate dust grains and water ices. We find
that starbursting LIRGs, which make up the majority of GOALS, are very
consistent in their MIR properties (i.e. tau_9.7um, tau_ice, neon line and PAH
feature ratios). However, as their PAH EQW decreases, usually an indicator of
an increasingly dominant AGN, LIRGs cover a larger spread in these MIR
parameters. The contribution from PAHs to the total L(IR) in LIRGs varies from
2-29% and LIRGs prior to their first encounter show higher L(PAH)/L(IR) ratios
on average. We observe a correlation between the strength of the starburst
(IR8) and the PAH fraction at 8um but not with the 7.7 to 11.3 PAH ratio,
suggesting the fractional PDR emission, and not the overall grain properties,
is associated with the rise in IR8 for galaxies off the starburst main
sequence. We detect crystalline silicate features in 6% of the sample but only
in the most obscured sources (s_9.7um < -1.24). Ice absorption features are
observed in 11% (56%) of GOALS LIRGs (ULIRGs). Most GOALS LIRGs have
L(H2)/L(PAH) ratios elevated above those observed for normal star-forming
galaxies and exhibit a trend for increasing L(H2)/L(PAH) ratio with increasing
L(H2). While star formation appears to be the dominant process responsible for
exciting the H2 in most of the GOALS galaxies, a subset of LIRGs (10%) show
excess H2 emission that is inconsistent with PDR models and may be excited by
shocks or AGN-induced outflows.

with the heavy-to-light transition form factors (TFFs), whose non-perturbative
dynamics are parameterized into the light-meson's light-cone distribution
amplitudes (LCDAs) with various twist structures. By taking the chiral
correlator as the starting point, we calculate the LCSRs for the $B\to\rho$
TFFs up to twist-4 accuracy. As for the TFFs at the large recoil region, we
observe that the twist-2 transverse DA $\phi_{2;\rho}^\bot$ provides the
dominant contribution, while the contributions from the remaining twist-3 and
twist-4 terms are $\delta^2$-suppressed. Thus, our present improved LCSRs
provides a good platform for testing the $\phi_{2;\rho}^\bot$ behavior. For the
purpose, we suggest a convenient WH-model for the $\rho$-meson leading-twist
wavefunction, in which the parameter $B_{2;\rho}^\bot\sim a^\bot_2$ dominantly
controls its longitudinal distribution. Typically, its DA $\phi_{2;\rho}^\bot$
is CZ-like as $B_{2;\rho}^\bot\simeq-0.20$, which changes to be asymptotic-like
as $B_{2;\rho}^\bot\simeq0.00$. By varying $B_{2;\rho}^\bot\in[-0.20,0.20]$, we
present a detailed comparison of the LCSR estimation for the $B\to\rho$ TFFs
with those of pQCD and Lattice QCD predictions. Furthermore, by using the
extrapolated TFFs, we estimate the CKM-matrix element $|V_{\rm ub}|$ with the
help of two $B\to\rho$ semi-leptonic decays. The predicted value for $|V_{\rm
ub}|$ increases with the increment of $B_{2;\rho}^\bot$, i.e. we have
$\Vub=(2.91\pm0.19)\times 10^{-3}$ for $B_{2;\rho}^\bot=-0.20$ and
$\Vub=(3.11\pm0.19)\times 10^{-3}$ for $B_{2;\rho}^\bot=0.00$. If using the
BABAR prediction as a criteria, we observe that
$B^{\perp}_{2;\rho}\in[-0.2,0.10]$, which indicates that the $\rho$-meson DA
$\phi_{2;\rho}^\bot$ prefers a single-peak behavior rather than a double-humped
behavior.

spectral energy distributions for galaxies. As one important observational
property for galaxies at ultraviolet and infrared wavelength bands, the
correlation between infrared-to-ultraviolet luminosity ratio and ultraviolet
color index (or ultraviolet spectral slope), i.e., the IRX-UV relation (or
IRX-beta relation), offered a widely used recipe for correcting dust
attenuation in galaxies, but the usability appears to be in doubt now because
of considerable dispersion in this relation found by many studies. In this
paper, on the basis of spectral synthesis modeling and spatially resolved
measurements of four nearby spiral galaxies, we provide an interpretation of
the deviation in the IRX-UV relation with variations in the attenuation law.
From both theoretical and observational viewpoints, two components in the
attenuation curve, the linear background and the 2175 Angstrom bump, are
suggested to be the parameters in addition to the stellar population age
(addressed in the first paper of this series) in the IRX-UV function; different
features in the attenuation curve are diagnosed for the galaxies in our sample.
Nevertheless, it is often difficult to ascertain the attenuation law for
galaxies in actual observations. Possible reasons for preventing the successful
detection of the parameters in the attenuation curve are also discussed in this
paper, including the degeneracy of the linear background and the 2175 Angstrom
bump in observational channels, the requirement for young and dust-rich systems
to study, and the difficulty in accurate estimates of dust attenuations at
different wavelength bands.

algorithms such as K-means or mean-shift should ideally find centroids that are
valid patterns in the input space, representative of data in their cluster.
This is challenging with data having a nonconvex or manifold structure, as with
images or text. We introduce a new algorithm, Laplacian K-modes, which
naturally combines three powerful ideas in clustering: the explicit use of
assignment variables (as in K-means); the estimation of cluster centroids which
are modes of each cluster's density estimate (as in mean-shift); and the
regularizing effect of the graph Laplacian, which encourages similar
assignments for nearby points (as in spectral clustering). The optimization
algorithm alternates an assignment step, which is a convex quadratic program,
and a mean-shift step, which separates for each cluster centroid. The algorithm
finds meaningful density estimates for each cluster, even with challenging
problems where the clusters have manifold structure, are highly nonconvex or in
high dimension. It also provides centroids that are valid patterns, truly
representative of their cluster (unlike K-means), and an out-of-sample mapping
that predicts soft assignments for a new point.

lattice do not commute with each other. Consequently, the Hamiltonian of a
local region will generally not commute with that of the entire system, and so
the two cannot be measured simultaneously. The connection between the
probability distributions of measurement outcomes of the local and global
Hamiltonians will depend on the angles between the diagonalizing bases of these
two Hamiltonians. In this paper we characterize the relation between these two
distributions. On one hand, we upperbound the probability of measuring an
energy $\tau$ in a local region, if the global system is in a superposition of
eigenstates with energies $\epsilon<\tau$. On the other hand, we bound the
probability of measuring a global energy $\epsilon$ in a bipartite system that
is in a tensor product of eigenstates of its two subsystems. Very roughly, we
show that due to the local nature of the governing interactions, these
distributions are identical to what one encounters in the commuting case, up to
some exponentially small corrections. Finally, we use these bounds to study the
spectrum of a locally truncated Hamiltonian, in which the energies of a
contiguous region have been truncated above some threshold energy $\tau$. We
show that the lower part of the spectrum of this Hamiltonian is exponentially
close to that of the original Hamiltonian. A restricted version of this result

for the projected specific stellar angular momentum, for each galaxy and
classify the 79 ETGs in our samples as fast or slow rotators. We calculate the
fraction of slow rotators in the ETG populations ($f_{SR}$) of the clusters to
be $0.21\pm0.08$, $0.08\pm0.08$ and $0.12\pm0.06$ for Abell 85, 168 and 2399
respectively, with an overall fraction of $0.15\pm0.04$. These numbers are
broadly consistent with the values found in the literature, confirming recent
work asserting that the fraction of slow rotators in the ETG population is
constant across many orders of magnitude in global environment.
  We examine the distribution of kinematic classes in each cluster as a
function of environment using the projected density of galaxies: the kinematic
morphology-density relation. We find that in Abell 85 $f_{SR}$ increases in
higher density regions but in Abell 168 and Abell 2399 this trend is not seen.
We examine the differences between the individual clusters to explain this. In
addition, we find slow rotators on the outskirts of two of the clusters
studied, Abell 85 and 2399. These galaxies reside in intermediate to low
density regions and have clearly not formed at the centre of a cluster
environment. We hypothesise that they formed at the centres of groups and are
falling into the clusters for the first time.

works on MapReduce load balance focus on coarse-grained scheduling. This study
concerns fine-grained scheduling on MapReduce operations, with each operation
representing one invocation of the Map or Reduce function. By default,
MapReduce adopts the hash-based method to schedule Reduce operations, which
often leads to poor load balance. In addition, the copy phase of Reduce tasks
overlaps with Map tasks, which significantly hinders the progress of Map tasks
due to I/O contention. Moreover, the three phases of Reduce tasks run in
sequence, while consuming different resources, thereby under-utilizing
resources. To overcome these problems, we introduce a set of mechanisms named
OS4M (Operation Scheduling for MapReduce) to improve MapReduce's performance.
OS4M achieves load balance by collecting statistics of all Map operations, and
calculates a globally optimal schedule to distribute Reduce operations. With
OS4M, the copy phase of Reduce tasks no longer overlaps with Map tasks, and the
three phases of Reduce tasks are pipelined based on their operation loads. OS4M
has been transparently incorporated into MapReduce. Evaluations on standard
benchmarks show that OS4M's job duration can be shortened by up to 42%,

  Random Permutations","30 pages, no figures",,,,"math.PR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A random $n$-permutation may be generated by sequentially removing random
cards $C_1,...,C_n$ from an $n$-card deck $D = \{1,...,n\}$. The permutation
$\sigma$ is simply the sequence of cards in the order they are removed. This
permutation is itself uniformly random, as long as each random card $C_t$ is
drawn uniformly from the remaining set at time $t$. We consider, here, a
variant of this simple procedure in which one is given a choice between $k$
random cards from the remaining set at each step, and selects the lowest
numbered of these for removal. This induces a bias towards selecting lower
numbered of the remaining cards at each step, and therefore leads to a final
permutation which is more ""ordered"" than in the uniform case (i.e. closer to
the identity permutation id $=(1,2,3,...,n)$).
  We quantify this effect in terms of two natural measures of order: The number
of inversions $I$ and the length of the longest increasing subsequence $L$. For
inversions, we establish a weak law of large numbers and central limit theorem,
both for fixed and growing $k$. For the longest increasing subsequence, we
establish the rate of scaling, in general, and existence of a weak law in the
case of growing $k$. We also show that the minimum strategy, of selecting the
minimum of the $k$ given choices at each step, is optimal for minimizing the
number of inversions in the space of all online $k$-card selection rules.

range is lower than other currently operating instruments which is capable of
detecting GRBs. Since the beginning of the MAXI operation on August 15, 2009,
GSC observed 35 GRBs up to the middle of 2013. One third of them are also
observed by other satellites. The rest of them show a trend to have soft
spectra and low fluxes. Because of the contribution of those XRFs, the MAXI GRB
rate is about three times higher than those expected from the BATSE log N - log
P distribution. When we compare it to the observational results of the
Wide-field X-ray Monitor on the High Energy Transient Explorer 2, which covers
the the same energy range to that of MAXI/GSC, we find a possibility that many
of MAXI bursts are XRFs with Epeak lower than 20 keV. We discuss the source of
soft GRBs observed only by MAXI. The MAXI log N - log S distribution suggests
that the MAXI XRFs distribute in closer distance than hard GRBs. Since the
distributions of the hardness of galactic stellar flares and X-ray bursts
overlap with those of MAXI GRBs, we discuss a possibility of a confusion of

graphene nanoribbons, and expose numerous hitherto unknown peculiar properties
of these systems at zero energy, where both sublattices decouple because of
chiral symmetry. For clean ribbons, we give a quantitative description of the
unusual power-law dispersion of the central energy bands and of its main
consequences, including the strong divergence of the density of states near
zero energy, and the vanishing of the transverse localization length of the
corresponding edge states. In the presence of off-diagonal disorder, which
respects the lattice chiral symmetry, all zero-energy localization properties
are found to be anomalous. Recasting the problem in terms of coupled Brownian
motions enables us to derive numerous asymptotic results by analytical means.
In particular the typical conductance $g_N$ of a disordered sample of width $N$
and length $L$ is shown to decay as $\exp(-C_Nw\sqrt{L})$, for arbitrary values
of the disorder strength $w$, while the relative variance of $\ln g_N$
approaches a non-trivial constant $K_N$. The dependence of the constants $C_N$

transfer-matrix formalism, zigzag ribbons provide a case study with many
unusual features. The transfer matrix describing propagation through one unit
cell of a clean ribbon is not diagonalizable at zero energy. In the disordered

highly tunable depending on the relation between the interlayer tunneling
amplitude, Zeeman energy and surface potential. A ratio between the first two
parameters controls a topological transition between chiral and helical surface
state band-structures. In the former case localized states, whose
wave-functions are confined near single TI layers, emerge in a narrow parameter
range where they coexist with itinerant states. In regular superlattices these
localized states form a flat band in the vertical direction. Such a
localization has a topological origin. It is associated with a specific spatial
spin texture of these states. The localized states vanish upon the topological
phase transition from the anomalous quantum Hall regime to a trivial phase
characterized by an anisotropic Dirac cone on the lateral surface of the

in extreme dynamic closing of adjacent H/D atoms (~ 0.01 {\AA}) required for
the tunneling through nuclear Coulomb barrier. DBs have been shown to arise

combination of more than one feature has also been investigated for this

recognition method has been proposed. A set of local boundary based and region
based features are derived from the labeled grid based representation of the
shape and are combined with a few global shape features to produce a composite

experimental analysis has shown that the proposed method is powerful enough to
discriminate the geometrically similar shapes from the non-similar ones.

in confined shear flow. Our numerical approach is based on a combination of
Lattice-Boltzmann models (LBM) and finite difference schemes, the former used
to model two immiscible fluids with variable viscous ratio, and the latter used
to model the polymer dynamics. The kinetics of the polymers is introduced using
constitutive equations for viscoelastic fluids with finitely extensible
non-linear elastic dumbbells with Peterlin's closure (FENE-P). We quantify the
droplet response by changing the polymer relaxation time $\tau_P$, the maximum
extensibility $L$ of the polymers, and the degree of confinement, i.e. the
ratio of the droplet diameter to gap spacing. In unconfined shear flow, the
effects of droplet viscoelasticity on the critical Capillary number
$\mbox{Ca}_{\mbox{\tiny{cr}}}$ for break-up are moderate in all cases studied.
However, in confined conditions a different behaviour is observed: the critical
Capillary number of a viscoelastic droplet increases or decreases, depending on
the maximum elongation of the polymers, the latter affecting the extensional
viscosity of the polymeric solution. Force balance is monitored in the
numerical simulations to validate the physical picture.

constrain the physical locations of forsterite in disks. We check for
consistency between two independent forsterite temperature measurements: the
23/69 feature strength ratio and the shape of the 69 micron band. We performed
radiative transfer modeling to study the effect of disk properties to the
forsterite spectral features. Temperature-dependent forsterite opacities were
considered in self-consistent models to compute forsterite emission from
protoplanetary disks. Modelling grids are presented to study the effects of
grain size, disk gaps, radial mixing and optical depth to the forsterite
features. Independent temperature estimates derived from the 23/69 feature
strength ratio and the 69 micron band shape are most inconsistent for HD141569

the forsterite spectrum. A model with T ~ 40 K, iron-rich (~0-1 % Fe) and 1
micron forsterite grains, and a model with warmer (T ~ 100 K), iron-free, and
larger (10 micron) grains. We find that for disks with low upper limits of the
69 micron feature (most notably in flat, self-shadowed disks), the forsterite
must be hot, and thus close to the star. We find no correlation between disk
gaps and the presence or absence of forsterite features. We argue that the 69
micron feature of the evolved transitional disks HD141569 and Oph IRS 48 is
most likely a tracer of larger (i.e. ~10 micron) forsterite grains.

(""prepotentials"") by solving the constraints of the Hamiltonian formulation. In
terms of the prepotentials, the action is written in a form in which its
electric-magnetic duality invariance is manifest. The prepotential action is
local, but the spacetime invariance is not manifest. Just as for the spin-2 and

similar to those of the free conformal theory of the same multiplet. The
automatic emergence of gauge conformal invariance out of demand of manifest
duality invariance, is yet another evidence of the subtle interplay between
duality invariance and spacetime symmetry. We also compare and contrast the
formulation with that of the analogous spin-(1,3/2) multiplet.

DAHA-Jones polynomials for $C^\vee C_1$ depend on $5$ parameters. Their

rational DAHA in connection with certain Hilbert schemes, though not much is

sub-threshold optical parametric oscillator (OPO). The filter, a modified
Faraday anomalous dispersion optical filter (FADOF), achieves 70% peak
transmission simultaneous with 57 dB out-of-band rejection and a 445 MHz
transmission bandwidth. When applied to the OPO output, only the degenerate
mode, containing one-mode squeezed vacuum, falls in the filter pass-band; all
other modes are strongly suppressed. The high transmission preserves
non-classical continuous-variable features, e.g. squeezing or non-gaussianity,
while the high spectral purity allows reliable discrete-variable detection and
heralding. Correlation and atomic absorption measurements indicate a spectral
purity of 96% for the individual photons, and 98% for the photon pairs. These
capabilities will enable generation of atom-resonant hybrid states, e.g.
""Schr\""odinger kittens"" obtained by photon subtraction from squeezed vacuum,
making these exotic states available for quantum networking and atomic quantum
metrology applications.

an n-th order derivative is approximated by an integral involving an orthogonal
polynomial of degree n. This notion was reviewed in great detail in a paper in
J. Approx. Theory (2012) by the author and Koornwinder. Here an approximation
of the Weyl or Riemann-Liouville fractional derivative is considered by
replacing the n-th derivative by its approximation in the formula for the
fractional derivative. In the case of, for instance, Jacobi polynomials an
explicit formula for the kernel of this approximate fractional derivative can
be given. Next we consider the fractional derivative as a filter and compute
the transfer function in the continuous case for the Jacobi polynomials and in
the discrete case for the Hahn polynomials. The transfer function in the Jacobi
case is a confluent hypergeometric function. A different approach is discussed
which starts with this explicit transfer function and then obtains the
approximate fractional derivative by taking the inverse Fourier transform. The
theory is finally illustrated with an application of a fractional
differentiating filter. In particular, graphs are presented of the absolute
value of the modulus of the transfer function. These make clear that for a good
insight in the behavior of a fractional differentiating filter one has to look
for the modulus of its transfer function in a log-log plot, rather than for
plots in the time domain.

represented using CTL+FO, a logic that allows mixing temporal and first-order
quantification. Verifying that a program satisfies a CTL+FO property is a
challenging problem that requires both temporal and data reasoning. Temporal
quantifiers require discovery of invariants and ranking functions, while
first-order quantifiers demand instantiation techniques. In this paper, we
present a constraint-based method for proving CTL+FO properties automatically.
Our method makes the interplay between the temporal and first-order
quantification explicit in a constraint encoding that combines recursion and
existential quantification. By integrating this constraint encoding with an
off-the-shelf solver we obtain an automatic verifier for CTL+FO.

AA Tau. Photometric and spectroscopic variability present in observations of AA
Tau is attributed to a magnetically induced warp in the accretion disc,
periodically occulting the photosphere on an 8.2--day timescale. Emission line
profiles show signatures of both infall, attributed to magnetospherically
accreting material, and outflow. Using the radiative transfer code TORUS, we
have investigated the geometry and kinematics of AA Tau's circumstellar disc
and outflow, which is modelled here as a disc wind. Photometric models have
been used to constrain the aspect ratio of the disc, the offset angle of the
magnetosphere dipole with respect to the stellar rotation axis, and the inner
radius of the circumstellar disc. Spectroscopic models have been used to
constrain the wind and magnetosphere temperatures, wind acceleration parameter,
and mass loss rate. We find observations are best fitted by models with a mass
accretion rate of $5\times10^{-9}$ M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$, a dipole offset of
between $10^\circ$ and $20^\circ$, a magnetosphere that truncates the disc from
5.2 to 8.8 R$_\star$, a mass-loss-rate to accretion-rate ratio of ~ 0.1, a

for low Galactic latitude and thus highly extincted regions. This has allowed
us to derive the best-fit extinction and distance information of more than 13
million stars, which are used to construct the three dimensional extinction

and may increase, decrease, or saturate with increasing chain length, depending

together with a simple and easily interpretable tight binding model, we show
how these different behaviors depend on the molecular backbone and its binding
to the contacts. We distinguish between resonances from binding groups or
undercoordinated electrode atoms, and those from the periodic backbone. It is
demonstrated that while the former gives a length-independent contribution to
the thermopower, possibly changing its sign, the latter determines its length
dependence. This means that the question of which orbitals from the periodic
chain that dominate the transport should not be inferred from the sign of the
thermopower but from its length dependence. We find that the same molecular

trends depending on the binding group: It can be positive or negative for short

mathematical convenient expressions for the sum of squared

time, important statistical metrics for the signal to interference and noise
ratio (SINR) are studied for various cases including non identical, identical
and fully correlated statistics. Furthermore, our analysis is extended to
multi-channel receivers and in particular to selection diversity (SD)
receivers, investigating two distinct cases, namely, signal-to-noise ratio
based and SINR-based SD. For all scenarios, simplified expressions are also
provided for the interference limited case, where the influence of thermal
noise is ignored. The derived expressions are used to analyze the performance,
in terms of the average bit error probability (ABEP) and the outage probability
(OP), of such systems operating over composite fading environments. A high SNR
analysis is also presented for the OP and the ABEP, giving a clear physical
insight of the system's performance in terms of the diversity and coding gains.
The analysis is accompanied by numerical evaluated results, clearly
demonstrating the usefulness of the proposed theoretical framework.

semi-analytical model to generate MW-like galaxies, for which a fiducial model
can reproduce the luminosity function and the stellar metallicity--stellar mass

investigating three metallicity properties of their dwarfs: the stellar
metallicity--stellar mass correlation of the dwarf population, and the
metal-poor and metal-rich tails of the stellar metallicity distribution in
individual dwarfs. We find that (1) the slope of the stellar
metallicity--stellar mass correlation is sensitive to the SN feedback strength

sensitive to the SN feedback strength; (3) the extension of the metal-poor

chemical properties are sensitive to the H$_2$ cooling process; and (5)
comparison of our model results with the current observational slope of the

reionized earlier than the cosmic average and local sources may have a
significant contribution to the reionization in the local region, and an
intermediate to strong SN feedback strength is preferred. Future observations

of two galaxy clusters to investigate the spatial offset between the maxima of
the X-ray and the SZ surface brightness of the merging clusters. We find that
significantly large SZ-X-ray offsets (>100kpc) can be produced during the major
mergers of galaxy clusters. The significantly large offsets are mainly caused
by a `jump effect' occurred between the primary and secondary pericentric
passages of the two merging clusters, during which the X-ray peak may jump to
the densest gas region located near the center of the small cluster, but the SZ
peak remains near the center of the large one. Our simulations show that
merging systems with higher masses and larger initial relative velocities may
result in larger offset sizes and longer offset time durations; and only nearly
head-on mergers are likely to produce significantly large offsets. We further
investigate the statistical distribution of the SZ-X-ray offset sizes and find
that (1) the number distribution of the offset sizes is bimodal with one peak
located at low offsets ~0 and the other at large offsets ~350-450kpc/h, but the
objects with intermediate offsets are scarce; and (2) the probabilities of the
clusters in the mass range higher than 2x10^{14}Msun/h that have offsets larger
than 20, 50, 200, 300, and 500kpc/h are 34.0%, 11.1%, 8.0%, 6.5%, and 2.0%
respectively at z=0.7. The probability is sensitive to the underlying pairwise
velocity distribution and the merger rate of clusters. Future observations on
the offsets for a large number of clusters may put strong constraints on the
cosmic velocity fields on the cluster scale and the cluster merger rate.

stable. This opens the possibility to place constraints on microphysical
mechanisms that stabilize them, such as the ICM viscosity and/or magnetic
fields. We performed exploratory high-resolution simulations of cold fronts
arising from subsonic gas sloshing in cluster cores using the grid-based Athena
MHD code, comparing the effects of isotropic Spitzer and anisotropic Braginskii
viscosity (expected in a magnetized plasma). Magnetized simulations with full
Braginskii viscosity or isotropic Spitzer viscosity reduced by a factor f ~ 0.1
are both in qualitative agreement with observations in terms of suppressing K-H
instabilities. The RMS velocity of turbulence within the sloshing region is
only modestly reduced by Braginskii viscosity. We also performed unmagnetized
simulations with and without viscosity and find that magnetic fields have a
substantial effect on the appearance of the cold fronts, even if the initial
field is weak and the viscosity is the same. This suggests that determining the
dominant suppression mechanism of a given cold front from X-ray observations
(e.g. viscosity or magnetic fields) by comparison with simulations is not
straightforward. Finally, we performed simulations including anisotropic
thermal conduction, and find that including Braginskii viscosity in these
simulations does not significant affect the evolution of cold fronts; they are
rapidly smeared out by thermal conduction, as in the inviscid case.

Jacobian algebra. In this paper we determine the graph of strongly reduced
components for both Jacobian algebras. Our main result is that the graph is
connected in both cases. Plamondon parametrized the strongly reduced components
for finite-dimensional algebras using generic g-vectors. We prove that the
generic g-vectors of indecomposable strongly reduced components of the
finite-dimensional Jacobian algebra are precisely the universal geometric
coefficients for the once-punctured torus, which were determined by Reading.

in the Pierre Auger Observatory as an excess of cosmic-ray air showers arriving
from the direction of the source. To avoid the statistical penalty for making
many trials, classes of objects are tested in combinations as nine ""target

from the Galactic Plane. Within a target set, each candidate source is weighted
in proportion to its electromagnetic flux, its exposure to the Auger
Observatory, and its flux attenuation factor due to neutron decay. These
searches do not find evidence for a neutron flux from any class of candidate
sources. Tabulated results give the combined p-value for each class, with and
without the weights, and also the flux upper limit for the most significant
candidate source within each class. These limits on fluxes of neutrons
significantly constrain models of EeV proton emission from non-transient
discrete sources in the Galaxy.

reaction $ep\rightarrow e'K^+{\Lambda}$, detecting the scattered $e'$ and $K^+$
in the final state along with the proton from the decay $\Lambda\rightarrow
p\pi^-$.The present study used the CEBAF Large Acceptance Spectrometer (CLAS),
which allowed for a large kinematic acceptance in invariant energy $W$
($1.6\leq W \leq 2.7$ GeV) and covered the full range of the kaon production
angle at an average momentum transfer $Q^2=1.90$ GeV$^2$.In this experiment a
5.50 GeV electron beam was incident upon an unpolarized liquid-hydrogen target.
We have mapped out the $W$ and kaon production angle dependencies of the
induced polarization and found striking differences from photoproduction data
over most of the kinematic range studied. However, we also found that the
induced polarization is essentially $Q^2$ independent in our kinematic domain,
suggesting that somewhere below the $Q^2$ covered here there must be a strong
$Q^2$ dependence. Along with previously published photo- and electroproduction
cross sections and polarization observables, these data are needed for the
development of models, such as effective field theories, and as input to

forces in robotics. However, real implementations of impedance control with an
inner loop may suffer from several limitations. Although common practice in
designing nested control systems is to maximize the bandwidth of the inner loop
to improve tracking performance, it may not be the most suitable approach when
a certain range of impedance parameters has to be rendered. In particular, it
turns out that the viable range of stable stiffness and damping values can be
strongly affected by the bandwidth of the inner control loops (e.g. a torque
loop) as well as by the filtering and sampling frequency. This paper provides
an extensive analysis on how these aspects influence the stability region of
impedance parameters as well as the passivity of the system. This will be
supported by both simulations and experimental data. Moreover, a methodology
for designing joint impedance controllers based on an inner torque loop and a
positive velocity feedback loop will be presented. The goal of the velocity
feedback is to increase (given the constraints to preserve stability) the
bandwidth of the torque loop without the need of a complex controller.

  Crypto-Book relies on a set of independently managed servers that
collectively assign each social network identity a public/private keypair. Only
an identity's owner learns all the private key shares, and can therefore
construct the private key, while all participants can obtain any user's public
key, even if the corresponding private key has yet to be retrieved. Having
obtained an appropriate key set, a user can then leverage anonymous
authentication techniques such as linkable ring signatures to log into
third-party web sites while preserving privacy.

three applications: a Wiki system, an anonymous group communication system, and
a whistleblower submission system. Our results show that for anonymity sets of
size 100, Crypto-Book login takes 0.56s for signature generation by the client,
0.38s for signature verification on the server, and requires 5.6KB of

ultraviolet ionizing radiation field and sub-solar metallicity, both of which
are expected to impact molecular cloud structure. We detect 13 bright, dense

aligned along a filamentary structure with a characteristic spacing that is
consistent with formation via the varicose fluid instability. Our analysis
shows that the filament is gravitationally unstable and collapsing to form
stars. There is a good correlation between HCO$^{+}$ emission in the filament
and signatures of recent star formation activity including H$_{2}$O masers and
young stellar objects (YSOs). YSOs seem to continue along the same direction of
the filament toward the massive compact star cluster R136 in the southwest. We
present detailed comparisons of clump properities (masses, linewidths, sizes)
in 30Dor-10 to those in other star forming regions of the LMC (N159, N113,

  The interstellar reddenings, metallicities, distances, and ages have been
compared to the literature values. Significant differences are usually due to
the usage of diverse empirical calibrations and differing assumptions, such as
concerning cluster metallicity, as well as distinct isochrones which correspond
to differing element-abundance ratios, internal stellar physics, and
photometric systems. Different interstellar reddenings, as well as varying
reduction and cluster-membership techniques, are also responsible for these
kinds of systematic differences and errors.
  The morphological ages, which are derived from the morphological indices
($\delta V$ and $\delta 1$) in the CM diagrams, are in good agreement with the
isochrone ages of 12 O\!Cs, those with good red clump (RC) and red giant (RG)
star candidates. No metal abundance gradient is detected for the range $6.82

metal abundances for these 20 O\!Cs.
  Young, metal-poor O\!Cs, observed here in the third Galactic quadrant, may be
associated with stellar over-densities, such as that in Canis Major (Martin et
al.) and the Monoceros Ring (Newberg et al.), or signatures of past accretion
events, as discussed by Yong et al. and Carraro et al.

to improve generalization. It has been shown that by minimizing non-convex
learning models, a better solution than the convex alternatives can be
obtained. Therefore, a non-convex model based on the capped-$\ell_{1},\ell_{1}$
regularization was proposed in \cite{Gong2013}, and a corresponding efficient
multi-stage multi-task feature learning algorithm (MSMTFL) was presented.
However, this algorithm harnesses a prescribed fixed threshold in the
definition of the capped-$\ell_{1},\ell_{1}$ regularization and the lack of
adaptivity might result in suboptimal performance. In this paper we propose to
employ an adaptive threshold in the capped-$\ell_{1},\ell_{1}$ regularized
formulation, where the corresponding variant of MSMTFL will incorporate an
additional component to adaptively determine the threshold value. This variant
is expected to achieve a better feature selection performance over the original
MSMTFL algorithm. In particular, the embedded adaptive threshold component
comes from our previously proposed iterative support detection (ISD) method
\cite{Wang2010}. Empirical studies on both synthetic and real-world data sets
demonstrate the effectiveness of this new variant over the original MSMTFL.
