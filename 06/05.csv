develops due to the nonlinear interations of waves, here represented by the
small inhomogeneities of the inflaton field. We present relevant aspects of

Hamiltonian systems on an infinite lattice which is translation invariant. The
couplings can be long range, provided that they decay moderately fast with
respect to the distance. For the solutions we construct, most of the sites are
moving in a neighborhood of a hyperbolic fixed point, but there are oscillating
sites clustered around a sequence of nodes. The amplitude of these oscillations
does not need to tend to zero. In particular, the almost periodic solutions do
not decay at infinity. We formulate an invariance equation. Solutions of this
equation are embeddings of an invariant torus on which the motion is conjugate
to a rotation. We show that, if there is an approximate solution of the
invariance equation that satisfies some non-degeneracy conditions, there is a
true solution close by. The proof of this \emph{a-posteriori} theorem is based
on a Nash-Moser iteration, which does not use transformation theory. Simpler
versions of the scheme were developed in E. Fontich, R. de la Llave,Y. Sire
\emph{J. Differential. Equations.} {\bf 246}, 3136 (2009). One technical tool,
important for our purposes, is the use of weighted spaces that capture the idea
that the maps under consideration are local interactions. Using these weighted
spaces, the estimates of iterative steps are similar to those in finite
dimensional spaces. In particular, the estimates are independent of the number
of nodes that get excited. Using these techniques, given two breathers, we can
place them apart and obtain an approximate solution, which leads to a true
solution nearby. By repeating the process infinitely often, we can get
solutions with infinitely many frequencies which do not tend to zero at

graphene nanobulges under three different substrate scenarios shows that, in
addition to the shape, the graphene-substrate interaction can crucially
determine the overall distribution and magnitude of strain and those fields, in

dynamics, continuum mechanics, and tight-binding electronic structure
calculations as an unbiased means of studying pressure-induced deformations and
the resulting PMF in graphene nanobubbles of various geometries. The interplay
among substrate aperture geometry, lattice orientation, internal gas pressure,
and substrate type is analyzed in view of strain-engineered graphene
nanostructures capable of confining and/or guiding electrons at low energies.
Except in highly anisotropic geometries, the magnitude of the PMF is generally
significant only near the boundaries of the aperture and rapidly decays towards
the center because under gas pressure at the scales considered here there is
considerable bending at the edges and the central region displays nearly
isotropic strain. When the deflection lead to sharp bends at the edges,
curvature and the tilting of the $p_z$ orbitals cannot be ignored and
contributes substantially to the total field. The strong and localized nature
of the PMF at the boundaries and its polarity-changing profile can be exploited
to trap electrons inside the bubble or of guiding them in channel-like
geometries defined by edges. However, we establish that slippage of graphene
against the substrate is an important factor in determining the degree of
concentration of PMFs in or around the bulge since it can lead to considerable
softening of the strain gradients there. The nature of the substrate emerges
thus as a decisive factor determining the effectiveness of nanoscale PMFs
tailoring in graphene.

consequence, in the context of $f(R)$ gravity, is that the Starobinsky model of
inflation is ruled out since it predicts a value of $r$ much smaller than what
is observed. Of course, the BICEP2 data need verification, especially from
Planck with which there is some tension, therefore any conclusion seems
premature. However, it is interesting to ask what would be the functional form
of $f(R)$ in the case when the value of $r$ is different from the one predicted

$f(R)$, once the slow-roll parameters are known with some accuracy. The
striking result is that, for given values of the scalar spectral index $n_{S}$
and $r$, the effective Lagrangian has the form $f(R)=R^{\zeta}$, where
$\zeta=2-\varepsilon$ and $|\varepsilon|\ll 1$. Therefore, it appears that the

hotly debated. Recent experimental work suggests that these charges can
separate on extremely short timescales (<100 fs). This can be understood in
terms of delocalised transport within fullerene aggregates, which is thought to
emerge on short timescales before vibronic relaxation induces polaron
formation. However, in the optimal heterojunction morphology, electrons and
holes will often re-encounter each other before reaching the electrodes. If
such charges trap and cannot separate, then device efficiency will suffer. Here
we extend the theory of ultrafast charge separation to incorporate polaron
formation, and find that the same delocalised transport used to explain
ultrafast charge separation can account for the suppression of nongeminate
recombination in the best devices.

reported by IceCube is that they are produced by cosmic rays in starburst
galaxies colliding with the dense interstellar medium. These proton-proton
($pp$) collisions also produce high-energy gamma-rays, which finally contribute
to the diffuse high-energy gamma-ray background. We calculate the diffuse
gamma-ray flux with a semi-analytic approach and consider that the very high
energy gamma-rays will be absorbed in the galaxies and converted into
electron-position pairs, which then lose almost all their energy through
synchrotron radiation in the strong magnetic fields in the starburst region.
Since the synchrotron emission goes into energies below GeV, this synchrotron
loss reduces the diffuse high-energy gamma-ray flux by a factor of about two,
thus leaving more room for other sources to contribute to the gamma-ray
background. For a $E_\nu^{-2}$ neutrino spectrum, we find that the diffuse
gamma-ray flux contributes about 20% of the observed diffuse gamma-ray
background in the 100 GeV range. However, for a steeper neutrino spectrum, this
synchrotron loss effect is less important, since the energy fraction in
absorbed gamma-rays becomes lower.

few samples and enjoy low computational cost per iteration. They have been
widely used in large-scale optimization problems. However, stochastic gradient
algorithms are usually slow to converge and achieve sub-linear convergence
rates, due to the inherent variance in the gradient computation. To accelerate
the convergence, some variance-reduced stochastic gradient algorithms, e.g.,
proximal stochastic variance-reduced gradient (Prox-SVRG) algorithm, have
recently been proposed to solve strongly convex problems. Under the strongly
convex condition, these variance-reduced stochastic gradient algorithms achieve
a linear convergence rate. However, many machine learning problems are convex
but not strongly convex. In this paper, we introduce Prox-SVRG and its
projected variant called Variance-Reduced Projected Stochastic Gradient (VRPSG)
to solve a class of non-strongly convex optimization problems widely used in
machine learning. As the main technical contribution of this paper, we show
that both VRPSG and Prox-SVRG achieve a linear convergence rate without strong
convexity. A key ingredient in our proof is a Semi-Strongly Convex (SSC)
inequality which is the first to be rigorously proved for a class of
non-strongly convex problems in both constrained and regularized settings.
Moreover, the SSC inequality is independent of algorithms and may be applied to
analyze other stochastic gradient algorithms besides VRPSG and Prox-SVRG, which
may be of independent interest. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
work that establishes the linear convergence rate for the variance-reduced
stochastic gradient algorithms on solving both constrained and regularized
problems without strong convexity.

introduce dynamics in 1-, 2- and 3-dimensional topological surgery, by means of

we address examples. We also introduce the notions of solid 1- and
2-dimensional topological surgery, and of truncated 1-, 2- and 3-dimensional
topological surgery, which are more appropriate for modelling natural

3-dimensional surgery and to connect surgeries in different dimensions.

of a $C^*$-bialgebra with a sort of ""unitary generator"". Our definition is
motivated to ensure that commutative examples arise exactly from semigroups of
contractions on a Hilbert space, as extensively studied recently by Spronk and
Stokke. The terminology arises as the Eberlein algebra, the uniform closure of
the Fourier-Stieltjes algebra $B(G)$, has character space $G^{\mathcal E}$,
which is the semigroup compactification given by considering all semigroups of
contractions on a Hilbert space which contain a dense homomorphic image of $G$.
We carry out a similar construction for locally compact quantum groups, leading
to a maximal $C^*$-Eberlein compactification. We show that $C^*$-Eberlein
algebras always admit invariant means, and we apply this to prove various
""splitting"" results, showing how the $C^*$-Eberlein compactification splits as
the quantum Bohr compactification and elements which are annihilated by the
mean. This holds for matrix coefficients, but for Kac algebras, we show it also
holds at the algebra level, generalising (in a semigroup-free way) results of
Godement.

the natural topology of the data. Given highly correlated data, decision trees
with oblique (multiple feature) splits can be effective. Use of oblique splits,
however, comes at considerable computational expense. Inspired by recent work
on discriminative decorrelation of HOG features, we instead propose an
efficient feature transform that removes correlations in local neighborhoods.
The result is an overcomplete but locally decorrelated representation ideally
suited for use with orthogonal decision trees. In fact, orthogonal trees with
our locally decorrelated features outperform oblique trees trained over the
original features at a fraction of the computational cost. The overall
improvement in accuracy is dramatic: on the Caltech Pedestrian Dataset, we
reduce false positives nearly tenfold over the previous state-of-the-art.

  Let $S$ be a K3 surface and let $\mathsf{Hilb}^d(S)$ be the Hilbert scheme of
$d$ points of $S$. In case of elliptically fibered K3 surfaces $S \to
\mathbb{P}^1$, we calculate genus $0$ Gromov-Witten invariants of
$\mathsf{Hilb}^d(S)$, which count rational curves incident to two generic
fibers of the induced Lagrangian fibration $\mathsf{Hilb}^d(S) \to
\mathbb{P}^d$. The generating series of these invariants is the Fourier
expansion of a power of the Jacobi theta function times a modular form, hence
of a Jacobi form.
  We also prove results for genus $0$ Gromov-Witten invariants of
$\mathsf{Hilb}^d(S)$ for several other natural incidence conditions. In each
case, the generating series is again a Jacobi form. For the proof we evaluate
Gromov-Witten invariants of the Hilbert scheme of $2$ points of $\mathbb{P}^1
\times E$, where $E$ is an elliptic curve.
  Inspired by our results, we conjecture a formula for the quantum
multiplication with divisor classes on $\mathsf{Hilb}^d(S)$ with respect to
primitive curve classes. The conjecture is presented in terms of natural
operators acting on the Fock space of $S$. We prove the conjecture in the first
non-trivial case $\mathsf{Hilb}^2(S)$. As a corollary, we find that the full
genus $0$ Gromov-Witten theory of $\mathsf{Hilb}^2(S)$ in primitive classes is
governed by Jacobi forms.
  We present two applications. A conjecture relating genus $1$ invariants of
$\mathsf{Hilb}^d(S)$ to the Igusa cusp form was proposed in joint work with R.

Finally, we present a conjectural formula for the number of hyperelliptic

aim is to minimize the total average energy needed to deliver a given pair of

available at all transmitters and receivers. The optimization problems
corresponding to the various strategies in fading channels are formulated,
solved and compared. For the DNC-based strategies, a simple time sharing of
transmission of the network-coded message and the remaining bits of the larger
message (DNC-TS) is considered first. We extend this approach to include a
superposition strategy (DNC-Sup), in which the network-coded message and the
remainder of the longer source message are superimposed before transmission. It
is demonstrated theoretically that DNC-Sup outperforms DNC-TS and CW-Sup in
terms of total average energy usage. More importantly, it is shown in
simulation that DNC-Sup performs better than PNC if the required rate is low
and worse otherwise. Finally, an algorithm to select the optimal strategy in
terms of energy usage subject to different rate pair requirements is presented.

optimization of the utilization of the resources in an FPGA. The wavelet
analysis showed that the power of events is concentrated mostly in a limited
range of the frequency spectrum (consistent with a range imposed by the input
analog band-pass filter). However, we found several events with suspicious
spectral characteristics, where the signal power is spread over the full
band-width sampled by a 200 MHz digitizer with significant contribution of very
high and very low frequencies. These events may not origin from cosmic ray
showers but can be human-made contaminations. The engine of the wavelet
analysis can be implemented into the modern powerful FPGA and can remove
suspicious events on-line to reduce the trigger rate.

store biometric templates being encoded as fixed-length feature vectors
protected. If multiple related records generated from the same biometric
instance can be intercepted, their correspondence can be determined using the
decodability attack. In 2011, Kelkboom et al. proposed to pass the feature
vectors through a record-specific but public permutation process in order to
prevent this attack. In this paper, it is shown that this countermeasure
enables another attack also analyzed by Simoens et al. in 2009 which can even
ease an adversary to fully break two related records. The attack may only be
feasible if the protected feature vectors have a reasonably small Hamming
distance; yet, implementations and security analyses must account for this
risk. This paper furthermore discusses that by means of a public
transformation, the attack cannot be prevented in a binary fuzzy commitment
scheme based on linear codes. Fortunately, such transformations can be
generated for the non-binary case. In order to still be able to protect binary
feature vectors, one may consider to use the improved fuzzy vault scheme by
Dodis et al. which may be secured against linkability attacks using

sufficient to provide effective shielding from solar proton bombardment that

communication by projecting the radar waveform onto the null space of the

we extend this approach to a maritime MIMO radar which experiences a time
varying interference channel due to the oscillatory motion of a ship, because
of the breaking of sea/ocean waves. We model this variation by using the matrix
perturbation theory and the statistical distribution of the breaking waves.
This model is then used to study the impact of perturbed interference channel
on the spatial approach of spectrum sharing. We use the maximum likelihood (ML)
estimate of a target's angle of arrival to study the radar's performance when
its waveform is projected onto the null space of the perturbed interference
channel. Through our analytical and simulation results, we study the loss in
the radar's performance due to the null space projection (NSP) of its waveform

scale to be above \Lambda_{QCD}, which generically yields large

mediator is relatively weakly coupled, so repulsive forces between dark-sector
nuclei are much weaker than coulomb repulsion between standard-model nuclei,
which results in an exponential barrier-tunneling enhancement over standard
BBN. Thus, dark nuclei are easier to make and harder to break than visible
species with comparable mass numbers. This process can efficiently yield a

an upper bound on the SUSY Higgs masses from naturalness considerations. As is
well-known for the MSSM, these bounds become weak at large tan beta. However,
we show that measurements of b to s gamma together with naturalness arguments
lead to an upper bound on tan beta, strengthening the naturalness case for
heavy Higgs states near the TeV scale. The precise bound depends somewhat on
the SUSY mediation scale: allowing a factor of 10 tuning in the stop sector,
the measured rate of b to s gamma implies tan beta < 30 for running down from
10 TeV but tan beta < 4 for mediation at or above 100 TeV, placing m_A near the
TeV scale for natural EWSB. Because the signatures of heavy Higgs bosons at
colliders are less susceptible to being ""hidden"" than standard superpartner
signatures, there is a strong motivation to make heavy Higgs searches a key

galaxies resolved with more than 5x10^4 particles each, and spanning a variety
of morphologies and halo masses (3x10^11 < Mvir < 10^14 Msun). We find a strong
trend between stellar halo slope and total halo mass, where more massive
objects have shallower stellar haloes than the less massive ones (-5.5 \pm 0.5
< alphaSTARS <-3.5 \pm 0.2 in the studied mass range). At fixed halo mass, we
show that disk-like, blue, young, and more massive galaxies are surrounded by
significantly steeper stellar haloes than elliptical, red, older, and less
massive galaxies. Overall, the stellar density profiles fall off much more
steeply than the underlying DM, and no clear trend holds between stellar slope
and DM halo concentration. However, DM haloes which formed more recently, or
which accreted larger fractions of stellar mass from infalling satellites,
exhibit shallower stellar haloes than their older analogs with similar masses,
by up to Delta(alphaSTARS) ~ 0.5-0.7. Our findings, combined with the most
recent measurements of the strikingly different stellar power-law indexes for
M31 and the Milky Way, appear to favour a massive M31, and a Milky Way
characterized by a much quieter accretion history over the past 10 Gyrs than
its companion.

opportunity to study rest-frame optical galaxy morphologies at z>1 and to
calibrate automated morphological parameters that will play a key role in
classifying future massive datasets like EUCLID or LSST. We study automated
parameters (e.g. CAS, Gini, M20) of massive galaxies at 1<z<3, measure their
dependence on wavelength and evolution with redshift and quantify the
reliability of these parameters in discriminating between visually-determined
morphologies, using machine learning algorithms. We find that the relative
trends between morphological types observed in the low-redshift literature are
preserved at z>1: bulge-dominated systems have systematically higher
concentration and Gini coefficients and are less asymmetric and rounder than
disk-dominated galaxies. However, at z>1, galaxies are, on average, 50% more
asymmetric and have Gini and M20 values that are 10% higher and 20% lower
respectively. In bulge-dominated galaxies, morphological parameters derived
from the rest-frame UV and optical wavelengths are well correlated; however
late-type galaxies exhibit higher asymmetry and clumpiness when measured in the
rest-frame UV. We find that broad morphological classes (e.g. bulge vs. disk
dominated) can be distinguished using parameters with high (80%) purity and
completeness of 80%. In a similar vein, irregular disks and mergers can also be
distinguished from bulges and regular disks with a contamination lower than
20%. However, mergers cannot be differentiated from the irregular morphological
class using these parameters, due to increasingly asymmetry of non-interacting
late-type galaxies at z>1. Our automated procedure is applied to the CANDELS
GOODS-S field and compared with the visual classification recently released on
the same area getting similar results.

much faster than two-body or non-resonant relaxation. We describe a new
parallel symplectic integrator, N-ring, which follows the dynamical evolution
of a cluster of N stars through vector resonant relaxation, by averaging the
pairwise interactions over the orbital period and periapsis-precession
timescale. We use N-ring to follow the evolution of clusters containing over
10^4 stars for tens of relaxation times. Among other results, we find that the
evolution is dominated by torques among stars with radially overlapping orbits,
and that resonant relaxation can be modelled as a random walk of the orbit
normals on the sphere, with angular step size ranging from 0.5-1 radian. The
relaxation rate in a cluster with a fixed number of stars is proportional to
the RMS mass of the stars. The RMS torque generated by the cluster stars is
reduced below the torque between Kepler orbits due to apsidal precession and
declines weakly with the eccentricity of the perturbed orbit. However since the
angular momentum of an orbit also decreases with eccentricity, the relaxation
rate is approximately eccentricity-independent for e<0.7 and grows rapidly with
eccentricity for e>0.8. We quantify the relaxation using the autocorrelation
function of the spherical multipole moments; this decays exponentially and the
e-folding time may be identified with the vector resonant relaxation timescale.

the sizes of these candidates to map out the size evolution of galaxies from
the earliest observable times. Their sizes are also used to provide a valuable
constraint on whether these unusual galaxy candidates are at high redshift.
Using galfit to derive sizes from the CANDELS F160W images of these candidates,
we find a mean size of 0.13$\pm$0.02"" (or 0.5$\pm$0.1 kpc at $z\sim9-10$). This

for lower-redshift interlopers to $z\sim9-10$ photometric selections lacking

unclear, as direct observations fail to reveal a clear correlation between
mass-loss rate and stellar properties. The horizontal-branch mass-distribution
is further complicated by Helium-enhanced multiple stellar populations, because
of differences in the evolving mass along the HB. We present a simple
analytical mass-loss model, based on tidal stripping through Roche-Lobe

non-gaussian mass-loss distribution, with high skewness, and contains only two
free parameters. We fit it to the HB mass distribution of four Galactic GCs, as
obtained from fitting the CMD with Zero Age HB (ZAHB) models. The best-fit

balanced strong MHD turbulence. In this paper we report the basic reasoning
behind universal nonlinear small-scale dynamo and the inertial range of MHD

evolve according to their own dynamics. The slow modes are being cascaded by
Alfv\'enic modes, while fast modes create an independent cascade. We show that

increasingly elongated as the star approaches periastron. A few months after
periastron passage, streams of material begin to accrete on the central black
hole with accretion rates $\dot{M} \sim 10^{-8}$ M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$. Predicted
Br$\gamma$ emission maps and position-velocity diagrams show an elongated
emission resembling recent observations of G2. A large increase in luminosity
is predicted by the emission coming from the shocked wind region during
periastron passage. The observations, showing a constant Br$\gamma$ luminosity,
remain puzzling, and are explained here assuming that the emission is dominated
by the free-wind region. The observed Br$\gamma$ luminosity ($\sim 8 \times

the Br$\gamma$ luminosity if the emission comes from the inner, free wind

break the age/reddening degeneracy for these intriguing sources, by
distinguishing whether a galaxy is very red in B-z because of being heavily
dust reddened, or whether because star formation has been (or is being)
quenched. Finally, we have compared our SFR(UV) to the SFRs derived by stacking
the radio data and to those derived from the H$\alpha$ luminosity of a sample
of star-forming galaxies at $1.4<z<1.7$. The two sets of SFRs are broadly
consistent as they are with the SFRs derived from the UV and by stacking the
corresponding PACS data in various mass bins.

taking advantage of their previously established classification into
pre-fusion, fusion, and relaxing galaxy mergers. Contrary to previous claims,
we show there is no tension between the main sequence scatter and the average
duration of the fusion star formation rate SFR peak. We confirm previous
estimates of the fraction of SFR due to morphologically-selected galaxies
(~23%) or the SFR enhancement due to major merger during the fusion phase
(~10%). However, galaxy mergers are not instantaneous processes, which implies
that the total fraction of the SFR associated to galaxies undergoing major
mergers must account for the three merger phases. When doing so, galaxies
involved in major mergers are found to represent 53-88% of the total SFR at
z~0.6. The fraction of LIRGs in the fusion phase is found to be in agreement
with the observed morphological fraction of LIRGs without disks and with the
observed and expected major merger rates at z<1.5.

platform for more detailed analysis. At its core, VIDE uses a substantially
enhanced version of ZOBOV (Neyinck 2008) to calculate a Voronoi tessellation
for estimating the density field and a performing a watershed transform to
construct voids. Additionally, VIDE provides significant functionality for both
pre- and post-processing: for example, vide can work with volume- or
magnitude-limited galaxy samples with arbitrary survey geometries, or dark
matter particles or halo catalogs in a variety of common formats. It can also
randomly subsample inputs and includes a Halo Occupation Distribution model for
constructing mock galaxy populations. VIDE uses the watershed levels to place
voids in a hierarchical tree, outputs a summary of void properties in plain
ASCII, and provides a Python API to perform many analysis tasks, such as
loading and manipulating void catalogs and particle members, filtering,
plotting, computing clustering statistics, stacking, comparing catalogs, and
fitting density profiles. While centered around ZOBOV, the toolkit is designed
to be as modular as possible and accommodate other void finders. VIDE has been
in development for several years and has already been used to produce a wealth
of results, which we summarize in this work to highlight the capabilities of

this DIB as a powerful, independent probe of dust extinction over a wide range

an exponential W_DIB distribution. We empirically determine the intrinsic rest

calculate absolute radial velocities of the carrier, which display the
kinematical signature of the rotating Galactic disk. We probe the DIB carrier

levels to each step in the path and sort steps according to their level.
Surprisingly, although sweep maps act by sorting, they appear to be bijective
in general. The sweep maps give concise combinatorial formulas for the
q,t-Catalan numbers, the higher q,t-Catalan numbers, the q,t-square numbers,
and many more general polynomials connected to the nabla operator and rational
Catalan combinatorics. We prove that many algorithms that have appeared in the
literature (including maps studied by Andrews, Egge, Gorsky, Haglund, Hanusa,
Jones, Killpatrick, Krattenthaler, Kremer, Orsina, Mazin, Papi, Vaille, and the
present authors) are all special cases of the sweep maps or their inverses. The
sweep maps provide a very simple unifying framework for understanding all of
these algorithms. We explain how inversion of the sweep map (which is an open
problem in general) can be solved in known special cases by finding a ""bounce
path"" for the lattice paths under consideration. We also define a generalized
sweep map acting on words over arbitrary alphabets with arbitrary weights,
which is also conjectured to be bijective.

sampling process is unbiased and efficient. The main approaches are
microcanonical, i.e. they sample graphs that match the enforced constraints
exactly. Unfortunately, when applied to strongly heterogeneous networks (like
most real-world examples), the majority of these approaches become biased
and/or time-consuming. Moreover, the algorithms defined in the simplest cases,
such as binary graphs with given degrees, are not easily generalizable to more
complicated ensembles. Here we propose a solution to the problem via the
introduction of a ""Maximize and Sample"" (""Max & Sam"" for short) method to
correctly sample ensembles of networks where the constraints are `soft', i.e.
realized as ensemble averages. Our method is based on exact maximum-entropy
distributions and is therefore unbiased by construction, even for strongly
heterogeneous networks. It is also more computationally efficient than most
microcanonical alternatives. Finally, it works for both binary and weighted
networks with a variety of constraints, including combined degree-strength
sequences and full reciprocity structure, for which no alternative method
exists. Our canonical approach can in principle be turned into an unbiased
microcanonical one, via a restriction to the relevant subset. Importantly, the
analysis of the fluctuations of the constraints suggests that the
microcanonical and canonical versions of all the ensembles considered here are
not equivalent. We show various real-world applications and provide a code

a static SU(2) gauge field. It gives rise to the protected edge states in
two-dimensional topological band-insulators, much like magnetic field yields
the integer quantum Hall effect. An outstanding question is which collective
topological behaviors of interacting particles are made possible by the Rashba
spin-orbit coupling. Here we addresses one aspect of this question by exploring
the Rashba SU(2) analogues of vortices in superconductors. Using the
Landau-Ginzburg approach and conservation laws, we classify the prominent
two-dimensional condensates of two- and three-component spin-orbit-coupled
bosons, and characterize their vortex excitations. There are two prominent
types of condensates that take advantage of the Rashba spin-orbit coupling.
Their vortices exist in multiple flavors whose number is determined by the spin
representation, and interact among themselves through logarithmic or linear
potentials as a function of distance. The vortices that interact linearly
exhibit confinement and asymptotic freedom similar to quarks in quantum
chromodynamics. One of the two condensate types supports small metastable
neutral quadruplets of vortices, and their tiles as metastable vortex lattices.
Quantum melting of such vortex lattices could give rise to non-Abelian
fractional topological insulators, SU(2) analogues of fractional quantum Hall
states. The physical systems in which these states could exist are trapped two-
and three-component bosonic ultra-cold atoms subjected to artificial gauge
fields, as well as solid-state quantum wells made either from Kondo insulators
such as SmB$_6$ or conventional topological insulators interfaced with
conventional superconductors.

groups on C*-algebras. An important technical result is a characterization of
the continuous Rokhlin property in terms of asymptotic retracts. As a
consequence, we derive strong KK-theoretical obstructions to the continuous
Rokhlin property. Using these, we show that the UCT is preserved under
formation of crossed products and passage to fixed point algebras by such
actions, even in the absence of nuclearity.
  Our analysis of the KK-theory of the crossed product allows us to prove a
$\mathbb{T}$-equivariant version of Kirchberg-Phillips: two circle actions with
the continuous Rokhlin property on Kirchberg algebras are conjugate whenever
they are KK$^{\mathbb{T}}$-equivalent. In the presence of the UCT, this is
equivalent to having isomorphic equivariant K-theory. We moreover characterize
the KK$^{\mathbb{T}}$-theoretical invariants that arise in this way.
  Finally, we identify a KK$^{\mathbb{T}}$-theoretic obstruction to the
continuous property, which is shown to be the only obstruction in the setting
of Kirchberg algebras. We show by means of explicit examples that the Rokhlin
property is strictly weaker than the continuous Rokhlin property.

the computing systems over the air medium. The underlying network stack is
based on a communication system that was originally designed for robust
underwater communication. We adapt the communication system to implement covert

further demonstrate how the scenario of covert acoustical communication over
the air medium can be extended to multi-hop communications and even to wireless

Different applications of covert acoustical mesh networks are presented,

In this nonstationary setting we point out a property of universality, meaning
that, for large matrix size, the empirical eigenvalue distribution depends only

can be achieved if the collision has occurred close to the plane and such that
the cores are deflected around each other. The projected mass profiles of both
clusters are well constrained because of the many interior lensed images,
leading to surprisingly flat mass profiles of both components in the region
15-100 kpc. We discuss the extent to which this may be generated by tidal
forces in our dynamical model which are large during an encounter of this type

information in XML documents. These languages, usually claiming to be
declarative, mainly consider the conjunctive relationships among data elements.
In order to present the operations where the hierarchical and the disjunctive
relationships need to be considered, such as restructuring hierarchy and
handling heterogeneity, the programs in these languages often exhibit a
procedural style and thus the declarativeness in them is not so prominent as in
conventional query languages like SQL.
  In this paper, we propose a declarative pattern-based functional XML query
language named XML Tree Query (XTQ). XTQ adopts expressive composite patterns
to present data extraction, meanwhile establishing the conjunctive, the
disjunctive and the hierarchical relationships among data elements. It uses the
matching terms, a composite structure of the variables bound to the matched
data elements, to present a global sketch of the extracted data, and develops a
deductive restructuring mechanism of matching terms to indicate data
transformation, especially for restructuring hierarchy and handling
heterogeneity. Based on matching terms, XTQ employs a coherent approach to
function declaration and invocation to consistently extract and construct
composite data structure, which integrates features of conventional functional
languages and pattern-based query languages. Additionally, XTQ also supports
data filtering on composite data structure such as hierarchical data, which is
seldom deliberately considered in other studies. We demonstrate with various
examples that XTQ can declaratively present complex XML queries which are
common in practice.

ergo-Saturn -- i.e. a S^2\oplus (S^1*S^1) ergo-surface. In the phase space of
solutions, the ergo-torus can either appear disconnected from the ergo-sphere

consistent with previous spectroscopic standards and the templates have a
radial velocity precision of $\sim$10--20 km s$^{-1}$. We calculate bolometric

between the blocks, this model is described by a logarithmic fractal, studied
previously, which is characterized by a constant increment of the length, area
or volume upon proliferation. We study to what extent the logarithmic
fractality survives, if each block is equipped with an Ising (pseudo-)spin
$s=\pm 1$ and the interactions between those spins are switched on (ranging
from antiferromagnetic to ferromagnetic). It turns out that the dependence of
the surface topology on the interaction sign and strength is not trivial. For
instance, deep in the ferromagnetic regime, our numerical experiments and
analytical results reveal a sharp crossover from a Euclidean transient,
consisting of aggregated domains of aligned spins, to an asymptotic logarithmic
fractal growth. In contrast, deep into the antiferromagnetic regime the surface
roughness is important and is shown analytically to be controlled by vacancies
induced by frustrated spins. Finally, in the weak interaction regime, we
demonstrate that the non-interacting model is extremal in the sense that the
effect of the introduction of interactions is only quadratic in the magnetic
coupling strength. In all regimes, we demonstrate the adequacy of a mean-field
approximation whenever vacancies are rare. In sum, the logarithmic fractal
character is robust with respect to the introduction of spatial correlations in
the hierarchical deposition process.

existence of a transformation chain of events, of which any particular dwarf

identically in the early universe, but then evolved differently because of
morphological transformations induced by dynamical processes like galaxy
harassment, ram pressure stripping, photo-evaporation, and so forth. We start
describing the population of dwarf galaxies and their spatial distribution in
the LG. Then, we describe those phenomena that can alter the morphology of a

Galaxies that can be attributed to different dynamical phenomena. While it is

challenging problem. The main difficulties are owing to the complex
relationship between heterogenous face image spaces. The heterogeneity is
always tightly coupled with other variations, which makes the relationship of
heterogenous face images highly nonlinear. Many excellent methods have been
proposed to model the nonlinear relationship, but they apt to overfit to the
training set, due to limited samples. Inspired by the unsupervised algorithms
in deep learning, this paper proposes an novel framework for heterogeneous face
recognition. We first extract Gabor features at some localized facial points,
and then use Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs) to learn a shared
representation locally to remove the heterogeneity around each facial point.
Finally, the shared representations of local RBMs are connected together and
processed by PCA. Two problems (Sketch-Photo and NIR-VIS) and three databases

offers one remedy to this problem by producing simpler reduced models that are

effective candidates for very large-scale problems due to their ability to
produce high-fidelity (optimal in some cases) reduced models for linear and
bilinear dynamical systems with modest computational cost. In this paper, we
will briefly review the interpolation framework for model reduction and
describe a well studied flow control problem that requires model reduction of a
large scale system of differential algebraic equations. We show that
interpolatory model reduction produces a feedback control strategy that matches
the structure of much more expensive control design methodologies.

frequent playback interruptions. To mitigate the interruptions, the media
player prefetches streaming contents before starting playback, at a cost of
delay. We study the QoE of streaming from the perspective of flow dynamics.
First, a framework is developed for QoE when streaming users join the network
randomly and leave after downloading completion. We compute the distribution of
prefetching delay using partial differential equations (PDEs), and the
probability generating function of playout buffer starvations using ordinary
differential equations (ODEs) for CBR streaming. Second, we extend our
framework to characterize the throughput variation caused by opportunistic
scheduling at the base station, and the playback variation of VBR streaming.
Our study reveals that the flow dynamics is the fundamental reason of playback
starvation. The QoE of streaming service is dominated by the first moments such
as the average throughput of opportunistic scheduling and the mean playback
rate. While the variances of throughput and playback rate have very limited
impact on starvation behavior.

radii are systematically brighter than their counterparts closer to the cluster
core; similarly, red-giant-branch stars in the cluster's periphery are bluer
than their more centrally located cousins. The observations can very well be
described by adopting an age spread of ~0.5 Gyr as well as radial gradients in

gradually from Y = 0.28, Z = 0.005 in the cluster core to Y = 0.25, Z = 0.003

If $F_r = \langle s_1, \ldots, s_r \rangle$ is a free group on $r$-generators
and $\alpha \in \operatorname{Hom}(F_r,[E])$ then the stabilizer of a
$\mu$-random point $\alpha(F_r)_x$ is a random subgroup of $F_r$ whose
distribution is conjugation invariant. Such an object is known as an ""invariant
random subgroup"" or an IRS for short. Bowen's generic model for IRS in $F_r$ is
obtained by taking $\alpha$ to be a Baire generic element in the Polish space
$\operatorname{Hom}(F_r, [E])$. The ""lean aperiodic model"" is a similar model
where one forces $\alpha(F_r)$ to have infinite orbits by imposing that
$\alpha(s_1)$ be aperiodic.
  In this setting we show that for $r < \infty$ the generic IRS $\alpha(F_r)_x$
is of finite index in $F_r$ a.s. if and only if $E = E_0$ is the hyperfinite
equivalence relation. For any ergodic equivalence relation we show that a
generic IRS coming from the lean aperiodic model is co-amenable and core free.
Finally, we consider the situation where $\alpha(F_r)$ is highly transitive on
almost every orbit and in particular the corresponding IRS is supported on
maximal subgroups. Using a result of Le-Ma\^{i}tre we show that such examples
exist for any aperiodic ergodic $E$ of finite cost. For the hyperfinite

estimate the probability that the observations are caused by transiting
Neptune-sized planets as $>$26$\times$ higher than a blend scenario involving
only one transiting planet, and $>$900$\times$ higher than a scenario involving
two blends and no planets. The radial velocities show a long term modulation
that might be attributed to a 1.5 M_jup planet orbiting at 1.8~A.U. from the
host, but more data are required to determine the precise orbital parameters of
this companion.

spheres in $(D+1)$-dimensional Minkowski spacetime. The Casimir interaction
free energy is derived from the zero temperature Casimir interaction energy via
the Matsubara formalism. In the high temperature region, the Casimir
interaction is dominated by the term with zero Matsubara frequency, and it is
known as the classical term since this term is independent of the Planck
constant $\hbar$. Explicit expression of the classical term is derived and it
is computed exactly using appropriate similarity transforms of matrices. We
then compute the small separation asymptotic expansion of this classical term
up to the next-to-leading order term. For the remaining part of the finite
temperature Casimir interaction with nonzero Matsubara frequencies, we obtain
its small separation asymptotic behavior by applying certain prescriptions to
the corresponding asymptotic expansion at zero temperature. This gives us a
leading term that is shown to agree precisely with the proximity force
approximation at any temperature. The next-to-leading order term at any
temperature is also derived and it is expressed as an infinite sum over
integrals. To obtain the asymptotic expansion at the low and medium temperature
regions, we apply the inverse Mellin transform techniques. In the low
temperature region, we obtain results that agree with our previous work on the
zero temperature Casimir interaction.

This dependence is usually accounted for assuming scaled solar chemical
composition. However, this approach may not be justified in evolved rotating
stars. The rotational mixing brings CNO-processed material to the stellar
surface, increasing the abundance of nitrogen at the expense of carbon and
oxygen, which potentially influences the mass-loss rates. We study the
influence of the modified chemical composition resulting from the rotational
mixing on the wind parameters, particularly the wind mass-loss rates. We use
our NLTE wind code to predict the wind structure and compare the calculated
wind mass-loss rate for the case of scaled solar chemical composition and the
composition affected by the CNO cycle. We show that for a higher mass-fraction
of heavier elements $Z/Z_\odot\gtrsim0.1$ the change of chemical composition
from the scaled solar to the CNO-processed scaled solar composition does not
significantly affect the wind mass-loss rates. The missing line force caused by
carbon and oxygen is compensated for by nitrogen line force. However, for a
very low-mass fraction of heavier elements $Z/Z_\odot\lesssim0.1$ the
rotational mixing significantly affects the wind mass-loss rates. Moreover, the
decrease of the mass-loss rate with metallicity is stronger at such low
metallicities. We study the relevance of the wind momentum-luminosity
relationship for different metallicities and show that for a metallicity
$Z/Z_\odot\lesssim0.1$ the relationship displays a large scatter, which
depreciates the use of this relationship at the lowest metallicities.

investigate the influence of mechanical forces on hydrolysis and catastrophes.
We use the allosteric dimer model, where tubulin dimers are characterized by an
equilibrium bending angle, which changes from $0^\circ$ to $22^\circ$ by
hydrolysis of a dimer. This also affects the lateral interaction and bending
energies and, thus, the mechanical equilibrium state of the microtubule. As
hydrolysis gives rise to conformational changes in dimers, mechanical forces
also influence the hydrolysis rates by mechanical energy changes modulating the
hydrolysis rate. The interaction via the microtubule mechanics then gives rise
to correlation effects in the hydrolysis dynamics, which have not been taken
into account before. Assuming a dominant influence of mechanical energies on
hydrolysis rates, we investigate the most probable hydrolysis pathways both for
vectorial and random hydrolysis. Investigating the stability with respect to
lateral bond rupture, we identify initiation configurations for catastrophes
along the hydrolysis pathways and values for a lateral bond rupture force. If
we allow for rupturing of lateral bonds between dimers in neighboring
protofilaments above this threshold force, our model exhibits avalanche-like
catastrophe events.

it avoids projections - the computational bottleneck in many applications -
replacing it by a linear optimization step. Despite this advantage, the known
convergence rates of the FW method fall behind standard first order methods for
most settings of interest. It is an active line of research to derive faster
linear optimization-based algorithms for various settings of convex
optimization.
  In this paper we consider the special case of optimization over strongly
convex sets, for which we prove that the vanila FW method converges at a rate
of $\frac{1}{t^2}$. This gives a quadratic improvement in convergence rate
compared to the general case, in which convergence is of the order
$\frac{1}{t}$, and known to be tight. We show that various balls induced by
$\ell_p$ norms, Schatten norms and group norms are strongly convex on one hand

of Spin(8,4) depending on the three squashing parameters, which satisfies
Dirac, and Klein-Gordon-like, wave equations describing the propagation of a
quantum spinning particle reflecting off spin-dependent potential walls. The
algebra of the susy constraints and of the Hamiltonian one is found to close.
One finds that the quantum Hamiltonian is built from operators that generate a
64-dimensional representation of the maximally compact sub-algebra of the
rank-3 hyperbolic Kac-Moody algebra AE3. The (quartic-in-fermions) squared-mass
term entering the Klein-Gordon-like equation has several remarkable properties:
1)it commutes with all the other (Kac-Moody-related) building blocks of the
Hamiltonian; 2)it is a quadratic function of the fermion number NF; 3)it is
negative in most of the Hilbert space. The latter property leads to a possible
quantum avoidance of the singularity (""cosmological bounce""), and suggests
imposing the boundary condition that the wavefunction of the Universe vanish
when the volume of space tends to zero. The space of solutions is a mixture of
""discrete-spectrum states"" (explicitely given) and of continuous-spectrum
states (parametrized by arbitrary functions entering some initial-value
problem). The predominantly negative values of the squared-mass term lead to a
""bottle effect"" between small and large volume-Universes and to a possible
reduction of the continuous spectrum to a discrete spectrum of quantum states
looking like excited versions of the Planckian-size Universes described by the

condition on Dirac field interacting with Abelian or non Abelian gauge fields.
The constraint is generated by a scalar field. This kind of model can be the
foundation for bag models which can produce confinement. The present work
represents among other things a generalization to the non Abelian case of our
previous result where the Abelian case was studied. In the $U(1)$ case the
coupling to the gauge field contains a term of the form $g(\phi)j_\mu (A^{\mu}
+\partial^{\mu}B)$ where $B$ is an auxiliary field and $j_\mu$ is the Dirac
current. The scalar field $\phi$ determines the local value of the coupling of
the gauge field to the Dirac particle. The consistency of the equations
determines the condition $\partial^{\mu}\phi j_\mu = 0$ which implies that the
Dirac current cannot have a component in the direction of the gradient of the
scalar field. As a consequence, if $\phi$ has a soliton behavior, like defining
a bubble that connects two vacuua, we obtain that the Dirac current cannot have
a flux through the wall of the bubble, defining a confinement mechanism where
the fermions are kept inside those bags. In this paper we present more models
in Abelian case which produce constraint on the Dirac or scalar current and
also spin. Furthermore a model that give the M.I.T confinement condition for
gauge fields is obtained. We generalize this procedure for the non Abelian case
and we find a constraint that can be used to build a bag model. In the non
Abelian case the confining boundary conditions hold at a specific surface of a

rate and the orientational diffusion constant. The equation is solved for the
stationary state distribution for arbitrary Weissenberg numbers, in particular
for the limit of high Weissenberg numbers. The stationary state gives an
interesting flow pattern for the orientation of the rod, showing the interplay
between flow due to the driving shear force and diffusion due to the random

asymmetric multiferroics, two locally stable ferroelectric states are not

The strong ferrimagnetism, high ferroelectric polarization, and significant

of collisionless magnetic reconnection has been carried out. Both the linear

In the linear regime, we have found a good agreement between the two approaches
over the whole spectrum of linearly unstable wave numbers, both in the drift
kinetic limit and for finite ion temperature. Nonlinearly, focusing on the
small-$\Delta '$ regime, with $\Delta '$ indicating the standard tearing
stability parameter, we have compared relevant observables such as the
evolution and saturation of the island width, as well as the island oscillation
frequency in the saturated phase.The results are basically the same, with small
discrepancies only in the value of the saturated island width for moderately
high values of $\Delta '$. Therefore, in the regimes investigated here, the
gyrofluid approach can describe the collisionless reconnection process as well
as the more complete gyrokinetic model.

synchronization between immobile nodes, based on time stamp exchanges via
two-way communication. In this paper, we consider a \textit{network of mobile

unsynchronized clocks and the pairwise distances as a polynomial function of
\textit{true} time. For a set of nodes, a pairwise least squares solution is
proposed for estimating the pairwise range parameters between the nodes, in
addition to estimating the clock offsets and clock skews. Extending these
pairwise solutions to network-wide ranging and clock synchronization, we
present a central data fusion based global least squares algorithm. A unique
solution is non-existent without a constraint on the cost function (\eg clock
reference node). Ergo, a constrained framework is proposed and a new
Constrained \Cramer\ Rao Bound (CCRB) is derived for the joint time-range
model. In addition, various constraints are proposed and their effects on the
proposed algorithms are studied. Simulations are conducted and the proposed
algorithm is shown to approach the theoretical limits.

All ten L dwarfs have large motions, and are located at distances between 9 and

K_s magnitude versus spectral type and luminosity versus Teff diagrams,
implying ages similar to or smaller than those typical of the field. The
detection of atomic lithium in the atmosphere of 2MASS J00452143+1634446 is
reported for the first time. Three dwarfs have locations in the HR diagram

depletion previously published. We did not find evidence for the presence of
astrometric companions with minimum detectable masses typically >=25 Mjup and
face-on, circular orbits with periods between 60-90 d and 3 yr around eight
targets. The astrometric and spectroscopic data indicate that about 60-70% of

are indeed young-to-intermediate-age brown dwarfs of the solar neighborhood

eventually be observed with the aid of weak measurement techniques. We denote
these as quantum sweeper effects, which are characterized by the bunching
together of low counting rate particles within very narrow spatial domains. We
give an explanation of this phenomenology by the circumstance that in reaching
down to ever weaker channel intensities, the nonlinear nature of the
probability density currents becomes ever more important, a fact which is
generally not considered - although implicitly present - in standard quantum

(MCs) arising in the field of systems biology. For density dependent families
of MCs that represent the interaction of large groups of identical objects,
Kurtz has proposed two kinds of approximations. One is based on ordinary
differential equations, while the other uses a diffusion process. The
computational cost of the deterministic approximation is significantly lower,
but the diffusion approximation retains stochasticity and is able to reproduce
relevant random features like variance, bimodality, and tail behavior. In a
recent paper, for particular stochastic Petri net models, we proposed a jump
diffusion approximation that aims at being applicable beyond the limits of
Kurtz's diffusion approximation, namely when the process reaches the boundary
with non-negligible probability. Other limitations of the diffusion
approximation in its original form are that it can provide inaccurate results
when the number of objects in some groups is often or constantly low and that
it can be applied only to pure density dependent Markov chains. In order to
overcome these drawbacks, in this paper we propose to apply the jump-diffusion
approximation only to those components of the model that are in density
dependent form and are associated with high population levels. The remaining
components are treated as discrete quantities. The resulting process is a
hybrid switching jump diffusion. We show that the stochastic differential
equations that characterize this process can be derived automatically both from
the description of the original Markov chains or starting from a higher level
description language, like stochastic Petri nets. The proposed approach is
illustrated on three models: one modeling the so called crazy clock reaction,
one describing viral infection kinetics and the last considering transcription
regulation.

two antiferromagnetic Potts models, coupled ferromagnetically. We derive the
Bethe Ansatz equations and study them numerically for two arbitrary twist
angles. The continuum limit is shown to involve two compact bosons and one non
compact boson, with discrete states emerging from the continuum at appropriate
twists. The non compact boson entails strong logarithmic corrections to the
finite-size behaviour of the scaling levels, the understanding of which allows
us to correct an earlier proposal for some of the critical exponents. In
particular, we infer the full set of magnetic scaling dimensions (watermelon
operators) of the Potts model.

symbolic sequences, comprising time-series that represent the orientation of a
single spin in a $2D$ Ising ferromagnet on a square lattice of size
$L^2=128^2$, for different system temperatures $T$. The latter were chosen from
an interval enclosing the critical point $T_{\rm c}$ of the model. At small
temperatures the sequences are thus very regular, at high temperatures they are
maximally random. In the vicinity of the critical point, nontrivial, long-range
correlations appear. Here, we implement estimators for the entropy rate, excess
entropy (i.e. ""complexity"") and multi-information. First, we implement a
Lempel-Ziv string parsing scheme, providing seemingly elaborate entropy rate
and multi-information estimates and an approximate estimator for the excess
entropy. Furthermore, we apply easy-to-use black-box data compression
utilities, providing approximate estimators only. For comparison and to yield
results for benchmarking purposes we implement the information-theoretic
observables also based on the well-established M-block Shannon entropy, which
is more tedious to apply compared to the the first two ""algorithmic"" entropy
estimation procedures. To test how well one can exploit the potential of such
data compression techniques, we aim at detecting the critical point of the $2D$
Ising ferromagnet. Among the above observables, the multi-information, which is
known to exhibit an isolated peak at the critical point, is very easy to
replicate by means of both efficient algorithmic entropy estimation procedures.
Finally, we assess how good the various algorithmic entropy estimates compare
to the more conventional block entropy estimates and illustrate a simple
modification that yields enhanced results.

We find that this emission is strongly polarized, with a median degree of

direction of the electric field and the Lorentz force acting on the particles,
depends on the observer location in the shower plane. This can be understood as
a superposition of the radially polarized charge-excess emission mechanism,
first proposed by Askaryan and the geomagnetic emission mechanism proposed by
Kahn and Lerche. We calculate the relative strengths of both contributions, as
quantified by the charge-excess fraction, for $163$ individual air showers. We
find that the measured charge-excess fraction is higher for air showers
arriving from closer to the zenith. Furthermore, the measured charge-excess
fraction also increases with increasing observer distance from the air shower
symmetry axis. The measured values range from $(3.3\pm 1.0)\%$ for very
inclined air showers at $25\, \mathrm{m}$ to $(20.3\pm 1.3)\%$ for almost
vertical showers at $225\, \mathrm{m}$. Both dependencies are in qualitative
agreement with theoretical predictions.

spectroscopy can be used to probe the viscosity. We concentrate on the impact

to the reflection and transmission coefficients of light. We demonstrate that
finite viscosity has the effect to decrease the reflectivity of a metallic
surface, while the electromagnetic field penetrates more deeply. While on a
phenomenological level there are similarities to the anomalous skin effect, the
model presented here requires no particular assumptions regarding the
corpuscular nature of the charge liquid. A striking consequence of the

Suprime-Cam (HSC) Ly$\alpha$ survey and a hypothetical spectroscopic survey
performed with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). Considering various
scenarios where the observed evolution of the Ly$\alpha$ luminosity function of
Ly$\alpha$ emitters at $z>6$ is explained partly by an increasingly neutral IGM
and partly by intrinsic galaxy evolution, we show how clustering measurements
will be able to distinguish between these scenarios. We find that the HSC
survey should be able to detect the additional clustering induced by a neutral
IGM if the global IGM neutral fraction is greater than $\sim$20 per cent at
$z=6.5$. If measurements of the Ly$\alpha$ equivalent widths (EWs) are also
available, neutral fractions as small as 10 per cent may be detectable by
looking for correlation between the EW and the local number density of objects.
In this case, if it should turn out that the IGM is significantly neutral at
$z=6.5$ and the intrinsic EW distribution is relatively narrow, the observed
EWs can also be used to construct a map of the locations and approximate sizes
of the largest ionized regions. For the JWST survey, the results appear a bit
less optimistic. Since such surveys probe a large range of redshifts, the
effects of the IGM will be mixed up with any intrinsic galaxy evolution that is
present, making it difficult to disentangle the effects. However, we show that
a survey with the JWST will have a possibility of observing a large group of
galaxies at $z\sim7$, which would be a strong indication of a partially neutral
IGM.

presented which illustrate how intense current structures form that can be
related, through the influence of line-tying, to the quasi-separatrix layers
(QSLs) of the initial configuration. It is demonstrated that the location
within the QSL that attracts the current, and its scaling properties, are
strongly dependent on the relative dimensions of the QSL with respect to the
line-tied boundaries. These results are contrasted with the behavior of a
line-tied 3D field containing an isolated null point. In this case, it is found
that the dominant current always forms at the null, but that the collapse is
inhibited when the null is closer to a line-tied boundary.

traditional view faces according to which Bohm's theory is committed to a
wave-function that is a physical entity over and above the particles, although
it is defined on configuration space instead of three-dimensional space. We
then enquire into the status of the law of motion, elaborating on how the main
philosophical options to ground a law of motion, namely Humeanism and
dispositionalism, can be applied to Bohmian mechanics. In conclusion, we sketch
out how these options apply to primitive ontology approaches to quantum

region that can be spatially resolved with current single-dish telescopes. We
used the IRAM-30m telescope to carry out an unbiased spectral survey toward two
important positions (namely IF and MP2), in order to studying the chemistry of
deuterated molecules toward Mon R2. We found a rich chemistry of deuterated
species at both positions, with detections of C2D, DCN, DNC, DCO+, D2CO, HDCO,
NH2D, and N2D+ and their corresponding hydrogenated species and isotopologs.
Our high spectral resolution observations allowed us to resolve three velocity
components: the component at 10 km/s is detected at both positions and seems
associated with the layer most exposed to the UV radiation from IRS 1; the
component at 12 km/s is found toward the IF position and seems related to the
molecular gas; finally, a component at 8.5 km/s is only detected toward the MP2
position, most likely related to a low-UV irradiated PDR. We derived the column
density of all the species, and determined the deuterium fractions (Dfrac). The
values of Dfrac are around 0.01 for all the observed species, except for HCO+
and N2H+ which have values 10 times lower. The values found in Mon R2 are well
explained with pseudo-time-dependent gas-phase model in which deuteration
occurs mainly via ion-molecule reactions with H2D+, CH2D+ and C2HD+. Finally,
the [H13CN]/[HN13C] ratio is very high (~11) for the 10 km/s component, which
also agree with our model predictions for an age of ~0.01-0.1 Myr. The
deuterium chemistry is a good tool for studying star-forming regions. The
low-mass star-forming regions seem well characterized with Dfrac(N2H+) or
Dfrac(HCO+), but it is required a complete chemical modeling to date massive
star-forming regions, because the higher gas temperature together with the

electrons. The results show that power-law electrons with the steepness cutoff
behavior can excite LWs effectively because of the population inversion
distribution below the cutoff energy ($E_c$). The growth rate of LWs increases
with the steepness index ($\delta$) and decreases with the power-law index
($\alpha$). The wave number of the fastest growing LWs ($k\lambda_D$),
decreases with the characteristic velocity of the power-law electrons
($v_{c}=\sqrt{2E_{c}/m_{e}}$) and increases with the thermal velocity of
ambient electrons ($v_T$). This can be helpful for us to understand better the
physics of LWs and the dynamics of energetic electron beams in space and

success of such a learning task depends heavily on a suitable divergence. A
large variety of divergences have been suggested and analyzed, but very few
results are available for an objective choice of the optimal divergence for a
given task. Here we present a framework that facilitates automatic selection of
the best divergence among a given family, based on standard maximum likelihood

beta-divergence family. Selecting the best beta then becomes a machine learning
problem solved by maximum likelihood. Next, we reformulate alpha-divergence in
terms of beta-divergence, which enables automatic selection of alpha by maximum
likelihood with reuse of the learning principle for beta-divergence.
Furthermore, we show the connections between gamma and beta-divergences as well
as R\'enyi and alpha-divergences, such that our automatic selection framework
is extended to non-separable divergences. Experiments on both synthetic and

a method using the precision measurement of the decay branching ratio of the
standard-model (SM)-like Higgs boson. The method is available if there is a
deviation from the SM in the coupling constants of the Higgs boson with the
weak gauge bosons. We find that, depending on the type of Yukawa interactions,
this method can give the best sensitivity in a wide range of tan\beta.

the 'blue tilt', in the Hydra and Centaurus galaxy clusters and constrain the
primordial conditions for star cluster self-enrichment. We analyse U,I
photometry for about 2500 globular clusters in the central regions of Hydra and
Centaurus, based on FORS1@VLT data. We convert the measured colour-magnitude
relations into mass-metallicity space and obtain a scaling of Z \propto M^{0.27
\pm 0.05} for Centaurus GCs and Z \propto M^{0.40 \pm 0.06} for Hydra GCs,
consistent with results in other environments. We find that the GC
mass-metallicity relation already sets in at present-day masses of a few 10^5
solar masses and is well established in the luminosity range of massive MW
clusters like omega Centauri. We compare the mass-metallicity relation with
predictions from the star cluster self-enrichment model by Bailin & Harris
(2009). For this we include effects of dynamical and stellar evolution and a
physically well motivated primordial mass-radius scaling. The self-enrichment
model reproduces the observed relations well for average primordial half-light
radii r_h ~ 1-1.5 pc, star formation efficiencies f_* ~ 0.3-0.4, and
pre-enrichment levels of [Fe/H] ~ -1.7 dex. Within the self-enrichment
scenario, the observed blue tilt implies a correlation between GC mass and
width of the stellar metallicity distribution. We find that this implied
correlation matches the trend of width with GC mass measured in Galactic GCs,
including extreme cases like omega Cen and M54. We conclude that 1. A
primordial star cluster mass-radius relation provides a significant improvement
to the self-enrichment model fits. 2. Broadenend metallicity distributions as
found in some massive MW globular clusters may have arisen naturally from
self-enrichment processes, without the need of a dwarf galaxy progenitor.

on resistively shunted grain boundary Josephson junctions. In addition the dc
SQUIDs contain a narrow constriction onto which a small magnetic particle can
be placed (with its magnetic moment in the plane of the SQUID loop and
perpendicular to the grain boundary) for efficient coupling of its stray
magnetic field to the SQUID loop. The separation of the location of optimum
coupling from the junctions allows for an independent optimization of the
coupling factor $\phi_\mu$ and junction properties. We present different
methods for calculating $\phi_\mu$ (for a magnetic nanoparticle placed 10\,nm
above the constriction) as a function of device geometry and show that those
yield consistent results. Furthermore, by numerical simulations we obtain a
general expression for the dependence of the SQUID inductance on geometrical
parameters of our devices, which allows to estimate their impact on the
spectral density of flux noise $S_\Phi$ of the SQUIDs in the thermal white
noise regime. Our analysis of the dependence of $S_\Phi$ and $\phi_\mu$ on the
geometric parameters of the SQUID layout yields a spin sensitivity
$S_\mu^{1/2}=S_\Phi^{1/2}/\phi_\mu$ of a few $\mu_{\rm{B}}/\rm{Hz^{1/2}}$

since the expressive power of SPARQL 1.0 is comparable with that of the

negated bound-constraints, equalities, nonequalities, constant-equalities, and
constant-nonequalities. The main result of the paper can be summarized by
saying that, as soon as inconsistent filter conditions can be formed,
satisfiability is undecidable. The key insight in each case is to find a way to
emulate the set difference operation. Undecidability can then be obtained from
a known undecidability result for the algebra of binary relations with union,
composition, and set difference. When no inconsistent filter conditions can be
formed, satisfiability is efficiently decidable by simple checks on bound
variables and on the use of literals. The paper also points out that
satisfiability for the so-called `well-designed' patterns can be decided by a
check on bound variables and a check for inconsistent filter conditions.

by smearing, and furthermore, the sensitivity to $\delta$ increases with
decrease of the energy threshold. The $\nu_e$ events contribute to the
CP-sensitivity as much as the $\nu_\mu$ events. While sensitivity of PINGU to

expansion of the density matrix in terms of the NESS-excitations, each of which
has its own (exponential) decay rate. However, when the decay rates tend to
zero for many NESS-excitations (the spectral gap of the Liouvillian is closed
in the thermodynamic limit), the long-time dynamics of the system can exhibit a
power-law behaviour. This relaxation to NESS expectation values is determined
by the density of states close to zero spectral gap and the value of the
operator in these states. We illustrate this main idea on the example of the
lattice of non-interacting fermions coupled to Markovian leads at infinite bias
voltage. The current comes towards its NESS value starting from a typical
initial state as $\tau^{-3/2}$. This behaviour is universal and independent of
the space dimension.

approach to motif analysis where network motifs are defined to be connectivity
patterns that occur in a subgraph cover that represents the network using
minimal total information. A subgraph cover is defined to be a set of subgraphs
such that every edge of the graph is contained in at least one of the subgraphs

significant densities of motifs have natural formulations in terms of subgraph

influence of disorder on the transition temperature, $T_c$, and on $\lambda(T)$
was investigated. The effects of scattering controlled by the annealing of
as-grown crystals was compared with the effects of artificial disorder
introduced by 2.5~MeV electron irradiation. The low temperature behavior of
$\lambda(T)$ can be described by a power-law function, $\Delta \lambda
(T)=AT^n$, with the exponent $n$ close to one in pristine annealed samples, as
expected for superconducting gap with line nodes. Upon $1.2 \times 10^{19}$
\ecm irradiation, the exponent $n$ increases rapidly exceeding a dirty limit
value of $n=$ 2 implying that the nodes in the superconducting gap are
accidental and can be lifted by the disorder. The variation of the exponent $n$
with $T_c$ is much stronger in the irradiated crystals compared to the crystals
in which disorder was controlled by the annealing of the growth defects. We
discuss the results in terms of different influence of different types of
disorder on intra- and inter- band scattering.

barlenses, defined as lens-like structures embedded in bars, with sizes of
about 50% of bars and axial ratios of 0.6-0.9. Based on observations and recent
simulation models we show evidence that barlenses are the more face-on
counterparts of B/P/X-shaped bulges. Using unsharp masks 18 new X-shaped
structures are identified, covering a large range of galaxy inclinations. The
similar masses and red B-3.6 mum colors of the host galaxies, and the fact that
the combined axial ratio distribution of the host galaxy disks is flat, support
the interpretation that barlenses and X-shapes are physically the same
phenomenon. In Hubble types -3<T<2 even half of the bars contain either a
barlens or an X-shaped structure. Our detailed 2D multi-component
decompositions for 29 galaxies, fitting the barlens/X-shape with a separate
component, indicate very small or non-existent classical bulges. Taking into
account that the structures we study have similar host galaxy masses as the
Milky Way (MW), our results imply that MW mass galaxies with no significant
classical bulges are common in the nearby Universe.

easy-plane anisotropy $A$. The vast triangular skyrmion lattice phase that is
stabilized by an external magnetic field evolves continuously as a function of
increasing $A$ into a regime in which nearest-neighbor skyrmions start
overlapping with each other. This overlap leads to a continuous reduction of
the skyrmion number from its quantized value $Q=1$ and to the emergence of
antivortices at the center of the triangles formed by nearest-neighbor
skyrmions. The antivortices also carry a small ""skyrmion number"" $Q_A \ll 1$
that grows as a function of increasing $A$. The system undergoes a first order
phase transition into a square vortex-antivortex lattice at a critical value of
$A$. Finally, a canted ferromagnetic state becomes stable through another first
order transition for a large enough anisotropy $A$. Interestingly enough, this
first order transition is accompanied by {\it metastable} meron solutions.

Green Infrastructure Strategy is one supporting tool to mitigate fragmentation,
inter-alia to increase the spatial and functional connectivity between
protected and unprotected areas. The Joint Research Centre has developed an
integrated model to provide a macro-scale set of indices to evaluate the
connectivity of the Natura 2000 network, which forms the backbone of a Green
Infrastructure for Europe. The model allows a wide assessment and comparison to
be performed across countries in terms of structural (spatially connected or
isolated sites) and functional connectivity (least-cost distances between sites
influenced by distribution, distance and land cover).
  Main conclusion: The Natura 2000 network in Europe shows differences among
countries in terms of the sizes and numbers of sites, their distribution as
well as distances between sites. Connectivity has been assessed on the basis of
a 500 m average inter-site distance, roads and intensive land use as barrier
effects as well as the presence of ""green"" corridors. In all countries the
Natura 2000 network is mostly made of sites which are not physically connected.
Highest functional connectivity values are found for Spain, Slovakia, Romania
and Bulgaria. The more natural landscape in Sweden and Finland does not result
in high inter-site network connectivity due to large inter-site distances. The
distribution of subnets with respect to roads explains the higher share of
isolated subnets in Portugal than in Belgium.

alpha-substitutive if the sequence can be obtained as the limit of iterating a
substitution with dominant eigenvalue alpha. Our results culminate in the
following fact: for multiplicatively independent real numbers alpha and beta,
if v is an alpha-substitutive sequence and w is a beta-substitutive sequence,
then v and w have no common non-erasing transducts except for the ultimately
periodic sequences. We rely on Cobham's theorem for substitutions, a recent

and the probability $p$ of adding an edge is sufficiently large, the smallest
eigenvalue of the grounded Laplacian asymptotically almost surely approaches
$|S|p$. We also show that for random $d$-regular graphs with a single row and
