presence of KK6 monopoles (KKO6-planes) compatible with N=4 supersymmetry in
four dimensions. The presence of KKO6-planes proves crucial to achieve full
moduli stabilisation as they generate new universal moduli powers in the scalar
potential. The resulting gauged supergravities turn out to be compatible with a
weak G2 holonomy at N=1 as well as at some non-supersymmetric AdS4 vacua. The
M-theory flux vacua we present here cannot be obtained from ordinary type IIA
orientifold reductions including background fluxes, D6-branes (O6-planes)
and/or KK5 (KKO5) sources. However, from a four-dimensional point of view, they
still admit a description in terms of so-called non-geometric fluxes. In this
sense we provide the M-theory interpretation for such non-geometric type IIA
flux vacua.

caused by decoherence originated from an interaction between a system of
interest and its surrounding environment. Here we establish a computational
quantum-classical boundary from the viewpoint of classical simulatability of a
quantum system under decoherence. Specifically, we consider commuting quantum
circuits being subject to decoherence. Or equivalently, we can regard them as
measurement-based quantum computation on decohered weighted graph states. To
show intractability of classical simulation above the boundary, we utilize the
postselection argument introduced by M. J. Bremner, R. Jozsa, and D. J.
Shepherd [Proceedings of the Royal Society A: Mathematical, Physical and
Engineering Science 465, 1413 (2009).] and crucially strengthen its statement
by taking noise effect into account. Classical simulatability below the
boundary is also shown constructively by using both separable criteria in a
projected-entangled-pair-state picture and the Gottesman-Knill theorem for
mixed state Clifford circuits. We found that when each qubit is subject to a
single-qubit complete-positive-trace-preserving noise, the computational
quantum-classical boundary is sharply given by the noise rate required for the
distillability of a magic state. The obtained quantum-classical boundary of
noisy quantum dynamics reveals a complexity landscape of controlled quantum
systems. This paves a way to an experimentally feasible verification of quantum
mechanics in a high complexity limit beyond classically simulatable region.

photonic quantum bits is necessary for the scalable quantum computation and
long distance quantum communication. Here we demonstrate that charged excitonic
complexes forming in strongly correlated quantum dot molecules are able to
generate tripartite hybrid entanglement under proper carrier quantization. The
mixed orbitals of the molecule construct multilevel ground states with sub-meV
hole tunneling energy and relatively large electron hybridization energy. We
show that appropriate size and interdot spacing maintains the electron particle
weakly localized, opening extra recombination channels by correlating
ground-state excitons. This allows for creation of higher order entangled
states. Nontrivial hole tunneling energy, renormalized by the multi-particle
interactions, facilitates realizing the energy coincidence among only certain
components of the molecule optical spectrum. This translates to the emergence
of favorable spectral components in a multi-body excitonic complex which
sustain principal oscillator strengths throughout the electric-field-induced
hole tunneling process. We particularly analyse whether the level broadening of
favorable spin configurations could be manipulated to eliminate the
distinguishability of photons.

In the case of a flux which is a small perturbation of the quadratic burgers

de-intercalating Li from LiVS$_2$. First, no Charge Density Wave (CDW) is found
by transmission electron microscopy down to 94 K. Though, \textit{ab initio}
phonon calculations unveil a latent CDW instability driven by an acoustic
phonon softening at the wave vector ${\bf q}_{CDW} \approx$ (0.21,0.21,0)
previously reported in de-intercalated samples. A further indication of latent
lattice instability is given by an anomalous expansion of the V-S bond distance
at low temperature. Second, infrared optical absorption and electrical
resistivity measurements give evidence of non metallic properties, consistent
with the observation of no CDW phase. On the other hand, magnetic
susceptibility and NMR data suggest the coexistence of localized moments with
metallic carriers, in agreement with \textit{ab initio} band structure
calculations. This discrepancy is reconciled by a picture of electron
localization induced by disorder or electronic correlations leading to a phase
separation of metallic and non-metallic domains in the nm scale. We conclude
that 1T-VS$_2$ is at the verge of a CDW transition and suggest that residual
electronic doping in Li de-intercalated samples stabilizes a uniform CDW phase

matter particles taking a generalized NFW profile with an inner slope
$\alpha=1.2$, has been analyzed in some regions of interest. The introduction
of such an additional component centered at the Galactic center is found to
have improved the goodness of fit to the data significantly in all background

is granulated into Gaussian subcarrier CVs and the physical Gaussian link is
divided into Gaussian sub-channels. The sub-channels are dedicated for the
conveying of the subcarrier CVs. The angular domain utilizes the phase-space
angles of the Gaussian subcarrier CVs to construct the physical model of a
Gaussian sub-channel. The subcarrier domain injects physical attributes to the
description of the subcarrier transmission. We prove that the subcarrier domain
is a natural representation of the subcarrier-level transmission in a
multicarrier CVQKD scheme. We also extend the subcarrier domain to a
multiple-access multicarrier CVQKD setting. We demonstrate the results through
the adaptive multicarrier quadrature-division (AMQD) CVQKD scheme and the
AMQD-MQA (multiuser quadrature allocation) multiple-access multicarrier scheme.
The subcarrier domain representation provides a general apparatus that can be
utilized for an arbitrary multicarrier CVQKD scenario. The framework is
particularly convenient for experimental multicarrier CVQKD scenarios.

embedding algorithm for wireless virtualization. Virtual networks can be
re-embedded dynamically using this algorithm, enabling increased resource usage
and lower rejection rates. We compare the dynamic greedy algorithm to a static

quantities. In particular, the socalled Expected Discounted Penalty Function
has been the object of a thorough study over the years. Although interesting in
their own right, ruin related quantities do not seem to capture path-dependent
properties of the reserve. In this article we aim at presenting the
probabilistic properties of drawdowns and the speed at which an insurance
reserve depletes as a consequence of the risk exposure of the company. These
new quantities are not ruin related yet they capture important features of an
insurance position and we believe it can lead to the design of a meaningful
risk measures. Studying drawdowns and speed of depletion for L\'evy insurance
risk processes represent a novel and challenging concept in insurance
mathematics. In this paper, all these concepts are formally introduced in an
insurance setting. Moreover, using recent results in fluctuation theory for
L\'evy processes, we derive expressions for the distribution of several
quantities related to the depletion problem. Of particular interest are the
distribution of drawdowns and the Laplace transform for the speed of depletion.
These expressions are given for some examples of L\'evy insurance risk
processes for which they can be calculated, in particular for the classical
Cramer-Lundberg model.

mass yield in the neutron-deficient nucleus 180Hg. Earlier experiments in the
mass region A=190-200 close to the beta-stability line, using the (p,f) and
(\alpha,f) reactions, observed a more symmetric distribution of fission
fragments. While the beta-delayed fission of 180Hg can be associated with
relatively low excitation energy, this is not the case for light-ion reactions,
which result in warm compound nuclei. Purpose: To elucidate the roles of proton
and neutron numbers and excitation energy in determining symmetric and
asymmetric fission yields, we compute and analyze the isentropic potential
energy surfaces of 174,180,198Hg and 196,210Po. Methods: We use the
finite-temperature superfluid nuclear density functional theory, for excitation
energies up to E*=30MeV and zero angular momentum. For our theoretical
framework, we consider the Skyrme energy density functional SkM* and a
density-dependent pairing interaction. Results: For 174,180Hg, we predict
fission pathways consistent with asymmetric fission at low excitation energies,
with the symmetric fission pathway opening very gradually as excitation energy
is increased. For 198Hg and 196Po, we expect the nearly-symmetric fission
channel to dominate. 210Po shows a preference for a slightly asymmetric pathway
at low energies, and a preference for a symmetric pathway at high energies.
Conclusions: Our self-consistent theory suggests that excitation energy weakly
affects the fission pattern of the nuclei considered. The transition from the
asymmetric fission in the proton-rich nuclei to a more symmetric fission in the
heavier isotopes is governed by the shell structure of pre-scission
configurations.

$S$ is unknown and may be comparable with the number of observations $n$. We
treat the respective regions where the functional is ""nonsmooth"" and ""smooth""
separately. In the ""nonsmooth"" regime, we apply an unbiased estimator for the
best polynomial approximation of the functional whereas, in the ""smooth""
regime, we apply a bias-corrected Maximum Likelihood Estimator (MLE). We
illustrate the merit of this approach by thoroughly analyzing two important
cases: the entropy $H(P) = \sum_{i = 1}^S -p_i \ln p_i$ and $F_\alpha(P) =
\sum_{i = 1}^S p_i^\alpha,\alpha>0$. We obtain the minimax $L_2$ rates for
estimating these functionals. In particular, we demonstrate that our estimator
achieves the optimal sample complexity $n \asymp S/\ln S$ for entropy
estimation. We also show that the sample complexity for estimating
$F_\alpha(P),0<\alpha<1$ is $n\asymp S^{1/\alpha}/ \ln S$, which can be
achieved by our estimator but not the MLE. For $1<\alpha<3/2$, we show the
minimax $L_2$ rate for estimating $F_\alpha(P)$ is $(n\ln n)^{-2(\alpha-1)}$

$n^{-2(\alpha-1)}$. For all the above cases, the behavior of the minimax
rate-optimal estimators with $n$ samples is essentially that of the MLE with
$n\ln n$ samples. We highlight the practical advantages of our schemes for
entropy and mutual information estimation. We demonstrate that our approach
reduces running time and boosts the accuracy compared to existing various
approaches. Moreover, we show that the mutual information estimator induced by
our methodology leads to significant performance boosts over the Chow--Liu

The capacity to
evolve and adapt makes successful treatment of infectious diseases and cancer
difficult. Indeed, therapy resistance has quickly become a key challenge for
global health. Therefore, ideas of how to control evolving populations in order
to overcome this threat are valuable. Here we use the mathematical concepts of
stochastic optimal control to study what is needed to control evolving
populations. Following established routes to calculate control strategies, we
first study how a polymorphism can be maintained in a finite population by
adaptively tuning selection. We then introduce a minimal model of drug
resistance in a stochastically evolving cancer cell population and compute
adaptive therapies, where decisions are based on monitoring the response of the
tumor, which can outperform established therapy paradigms. For both case
studies, we demonstrate the importance of high-resolution monitoring of the
target population in order to achieve a given control objective: to control one

theory of approximation using positive linear operators to analyze the
deviation of their expectations from the true functional, namely their
\emph{bias}.
  We characterize the worst case squared error risk incurred by the Maximum
Likelihood Estimator (MLE) in estimating the Shannon entropy $H(P) = \sum_{i =
1}^S -p_i \ln p_i$, and $F_\alpha(P) = \sum_{i = 1}^S p_i^\alpha,\alpha>0$, up
to multiplicative constants, for any alphabet size $S\leq \infty$ and sample
size $n$ for which the risk may vanish. As a corollary, for Shannon entropy
estimation, we show that it is necessary and sufficient to have $n \gg S$
observations for the MLE to be consistent. In addition, we establish that it is
necessary and sufficient to consider $n \gg S^{1/\alpha}$ samples for the MLE
to consistently estimate $F_\alpha(P), 0<\alpha<1$. The minimax rate-optimal
estimators for both problems require $S/\ln S$ and $S^{1/\alpha}/\ln S$
samples, which implies that the MLE has a strictly sub-optimal sample
complexity. When $1<\alpha<3/2$, we show that the worst-case squared error rate
of convergence for the MLE is $n^{-2(\alpha-1)}$ for infinite alphabet size,
while the minimax squared error rate is $(n\ln n)^{-2(\alpha-1)}$. When
$\alpha\geq 3/2$, the MLE achieves the minimax optimal rate $n^{-1}$ regardless

  As an application of the general theory, we analyze the Dirichlet prior
smoothing techniques for Shannon entropy estimation. We show that no matter how
we tune the parameters in the Dirichlet prior, this technique cannot achieve
the minimax rates in entropy estimation.

formulation of the SVI. The third method directly constructs confidence
intervals for the true SVI solution; intervals produced with this method meet a
minimum specified level of confidence in the same situations for which the
first two methods are applicable. We justify the three methods theoretically
with weak convergence results, discuss how to implement these methods, and test
their performance using two numerical examples.

contribution to the current injection. This interference occurs with a net
energy absorption of $\hbar\omega$ and exists in addition to the previously
studied interference occurring with a net energy absorption of $2\hbar\omega$

possibility to block photon absorption by tuning the Fermi level, graphene is
the perfect material to study this contribution. We calculate the polarization
dependence of this all-optical effect for intrinsic graphene and show that the
combined response of the material at both $\omega$ and $2\omega$ leads to an
anisotropic photocurrent injection, whereas the magnitude of the injection
current in doped graphene, when transitions at $\omega$ are Pauli blocked, is
isotropic. By considering the contribution to coherent current control from

suggests that new QKD protocols may exist with higher secret key rates and
effective ranges larger than the metro-area limits of BB84 QKD over optical
fiber. In this paper we illustrate such a possibility with a new protocol
called Amplified Quantum Key Distribution (AQKD), which will be compatible with
the optical amplification typically encountered on inter-city fiber spans. We
analyze one instantiation of AQKD, in which the transmitter enclave contains an
optical amplifier (OA), with security against passive optical tapping. For this
scenario AQKD is shown to: give three times the secret key rate of BB84 at
spans up to 100km, increasing to more than a ten-fold gain at 140km; and double
the maximum single-span optical fiber transmission range to inter-city
distances (300km). Essential to these performance gains is a new
information-theoretic protocol post-processing stage called generalized
advantage distillation (GAD). AQKD could be implemented with commercial
off-the-shelf (COTS) hardware as an augmentation of present-day BB84 QKD. AQKD
avoids the expense, complexity and resource duplication of ""trusted relay""
approaches to QKD range extension. We expect AQKD to be compatible with fiber
spans containing intermediate OAs, which will facilitate its deployment as an
overlay on existing fiber networks.

velocimeter under construction as a next-generation instrument for the
Canada-France-Hawaii-Telescope. It is designed to cover a very wide
simultaneous near-IR spectral range (0.98-2.35 {\mu}m) at a resolving power of
73.5K, providing unpolarized and polarized spectra of low-mass stars at a
radial velocity (RV) precision of 1m/s. The main science goals of SPIRou are
the detection of habitable super-Earths around low-mass stars and the study of
how critically magnetic fields impact star / planet formation. Following a
successful final design review in Spring 2014, SPIRou is now under construction
and is scheduled to see first light in late 2017. We present an overview of key
aspects of SPIRou's optical and mechanical design.

coarsen spontaneously among players adopting win-stay-lose-shift. Secondly,
extortioners and players adopting tit-for-tat emerge and spread via neutral

fluid with negative equation of state. Since the function $f(\mathcal{R})$ is
not known \emph{a priori}, the need of a model independent reconstruction of
its shape represents a relevant technique to determine which $f(\mathcal{R})$
model is really favored with respect to others. To this aim, we relate
cosmography to a generic $f(\mathcal R)$ and its derivatives in order to
provide a model independent investigation at redshift $z \sim 0$. Our analysis
is based on the use of three different cosmological distance definitions, in
order to alleviate the duality problem, i.e. the problem of which cosmological
distance to use with specific cosmic data sets. We therefore consider the
luminosity, $d_L$, flux, $d_F$, and angular, $d_A$, distances and we find
numerical constraints by the Union 2.1 supernovae compilation and measurement
of baryonic acoustic oscillations, at $z_{BAO}=0.35$. We notice that all
distances reduce to the same expression, i.e. $d_{L;F;A}\sim\frac{1}{\mathcal
H_0}z$, at first order. Thus, to fix the cosmographic series of observables, we
impose the initial value of $H_0$ by fitting $\mathcal H_0$ through supernovae
only, in the redshift regime $z<0.4$. We find that the pressure of curvature
dark energy fluid is slightly lower than the one related to the cosmological
constant. This indicates that a possible evolving curvature dark energy
realistically fills the current universe. Moreover, the combined use of
$d_L,d_F$ and $d_A$ shows that the sign of the acceleration parameter agrees
with theoretical bounds, while its variation, namely the jerk parameter, is
compatible with $j_0>1$. Finally, we infer the functional form of
$f(\mathcal{R})$ by means of a truncated polynomial approximation, in terms of

assuming that Zn traces the build-up of Fe-peak elements. In this respect, the
chemical evolution of DLAs is clearly different from that experienced by Milky
Way halo stars, but resembles that of dwarf spheroidal galaxies in the Local
Group. We also find a close correspondence between the kinematics of Local
Group dwarf galaxies and of high redshift metal-poor DLAs, which further
strengthens this connection. On the basis of such similarities, we propose that
the most metal-poor DLAs provide us with a unique opportunity to directly study
the dwarf galaxy population more than ten billion years in the past, at a time
when many dwarf galaxies were forming the bulk of their stars. To this end, we
have measured some of the key physical properties of the DLA gas, including
their neutral gas mass, size, kinetic temperature, density, and turbulence. We
find that metal-poor DLAs contain a warm neutral medium with T_gas ~ 9600 K
predominantly held up by thermal pressure. Furthermore, all of the DLAs in our
sample exhibit a subsonic turbulent Mach number, implying that the gas
distribution is largely smooth. These results are among the first empirical
descriptions of the environments where the first few generations of stars may
have formed in the Universe.

WIMP, Generation 2 is only likely to identify the right operator if the
interaction is Coulomb-like, and is unlikely to do so in any other case. For a
WIMP with a mass of 200 GeV or higher, success is almost guaranteed. We also
find that, regardless of the scattering model and the WIMP parameters, a single
Generation 2 experiment is unlikely to successfully discern the momentum
dependence of the underlying operator on its own, but prospects improve
drastically when experiments with different target materials and energy windows
are analyzed jointly. Furthermore, we examine the quality of parameter
estimation and degeneracies in the multi-dimensional parameter space of the

general symmetry considerations, we construct a low-energy differential cross
section for double glueball exchange in terms of some undetermined coupling
constants and form factors. We extend this model to the Regge regime, replacing
the glueball propagators with Pomeron trajectories, and modifying the
interaction term by a factor derived from the 5-string scattering amplitude in
flat space. We then fix the couplings which remain undetermined, using the
Sakai-Sugimoto framework to model low-energy QCD. Finally, we generate a
simulation of the scattering process at $\sqrt{s} = 29.1 GeV$, where double
Pomeron exchange should play a role (secondary to double Reggeon exchange). We
focus on the dependence of the scattering cross section on the angle between
the scattered protons in the transverse plane. The results exhibit a definite
deviation from the angular dependence that arises as a consequence of natural
parity violation alone. The amount of deviation is primarily determined by
couplings that come from the Chern-Simons action of the AdS/QCD supergravity
dual, which is directly related to the QCD gravitational anomaly, and thus

currents with the spin-polarization of magnetic materials is interesting with
respect to exploring superconducting analogues of topics in spintronics. In
order to accomplish this aim, it is pivotal to understand how
spin-supercurrents interact dynamically with magnetization textures. We
investigate the appearance of a spin-supercurrent and the resulting
magnetization dynamics in a textured magnetic Josephson current by using three
experimentally relevant models: i) a S/F/S junction with spin-active
interfaces, ii) a S/F1/F2/F3/S Josephson junction with a ferromagnetic
trilayer, and iii) a Josephson junction containing a domain wall. In all of
these cases, the supercurrent is spin-polarized and exerts a spin-transfer
torque on the ferromagnetic interlayers which causes magnetization dynamics.
Using a scattering matrix formalism in the clean limit, we compute the
Andreev-bound states and free energy of the system which is used to solve the
Landau-Lifshiftz-Gilbert equation. We compute both how the inhomogeneous
magnetism influences the phase-dependence of the charge supercurrent as well as
the magnetization dynamics caused by the spin-supercurrent. Using a realistic
experimental parameter set, we find that the supercurrent can induce
magnetization switching that is controlled by the superconducting phase
difference. Moreover, we demonstrate that the combined effect of chiral spin
symmetry breaking and interface scattering causes the system to act as a phase
battery that may supply any superconducting phase difference phi in the ground
state. Such a phi junction is accompanied by an anomalous supercurrent
appearing even at zero phase difference, and we demonstrate that the flow
direction of this current is controlled by the chirality of the magnetization
configuration.

larger than $\sim 10^9 ~ M_\odot$ formed before $z=6$. That such large SMBHs
formed so early in the Universe remains an open theoretical problem. One
possibility is that gas in atomic cooling halos exposed to strong Lyman-Werner
(LW) radiation forms $10^4-10^6 ~ M_\odot$ supermassive stars which quickly
collapse into black holes. We propose a scenario for direct collapse black hole
(DCBH) formation based on synchronized pairs of pristine atomic cooling halos.
We consider halos at very small separation with one halo being a subhalo of the
other. The first halo to surpass the atomic cooling threshold forms stars. Soon
after these stars are formed, the other halo reaches the cooling threshold and
due to its small distance from the newly formed galaxy, is exposed to the
critical LW intensity required to form a DCBH. The main advantage of this
scenario is that synchronization can potentially prevent photoevaporation and
metal pollution in DCBH-forming halos. Since the halos reach the atomic cooling
threshold at nearly the same time, the DCBH-forming halo is only exposed to
ionizing radiation for a brief period. Tight synchronization could allow the
DCBH to form before stars in the nearby galaxy reach the end of their lives and
generate supernovae winds. We use N-body simulations to estimate the abundance
of DCBHs formed in this way. The largest source of uncertainty in our estimate
is the initial mass function (IMF) of metal free stars formed in atomic cooling
halos. We find that even for tight synchronization, the density of DCBHs formed
in this scenario could explain the SMBHs implied by $z=6$ quasar observations.
Metal pollution and photoevaporation could potentially reduce the abundance of
DCBHs below that required to explain the observations in other models that rely
on a high LW flux.

network where the disorder can be quenched or annealed. The network consists of
four-fold coordinated sites connected via variable length one-dimensional
chains. Our emphasis is on nonuniversal properties and we consider the
transition temperature and other equilibrium thermodynamic properties,
including those associated with one dimensional fluctuations arising from the
chains. We use analytic methods in the annealed case, and a Monte Carlo
simulation for the quenched disorder. Our objective is to study the difference
between quenched and annealed results with a broad random distribution of
interaction parameters. The former represents a situation where the time scale
associated with the randomness is very long and the corresponding degrees of
freedom can be viewed as frozen, while the annealed case models the situation
where this is not so. We find that the transition temperature and the entropy
associated with one dimensional fluctuations are always higher for quenched
disorder than in the annealed case. These differences increase with the
strength of the disorder up to a saturating value. We discuss our results in
connection to physical systems where a broad distribution of interaction
strengths is present.

unidentified features, including the 21 um emission feature. To test for the
presence of fullerenes, we used the position and width of the feature at
18.7-18.9 um and examined other features at 17.4 and 6-9 um. This method adds
three new fullerene sources to the known sample, but it also calls into
question three previous identifications. We confirm that the strong 11 um
features seen in some sources arise primarily from SiC, which may exist as a
coating around carbonaceous cores and result from photo-processing. Spectra
showing the 21 um feature usually show the newly defined Class D PAH profile at
7-9 um. These spectra exhibit unusual PAH profiles at 11-14 um, with weak
contributions at 12.7 um, which we define as Class D1, or show features shifted
to ~11.4, 12.4, and 13.2 um, which we define as Class D2. Alkyne hydrocarbons
match the 15.8 um feature associated with 21 um emission. Sources showing
fullerene emission but no PAHs have blue colors in the optical, suggesting a
clear line of sight to the central source. Spectra with 21 um features and
Class D2 PAH emission also show photometric evidence for a relatively clear
line of sight to the central source. The multiple associations of the 21 um

  Multi-bit Decision","submitted to IEEE TVLSI in Feb 2014, accepted in Sep. 2014",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Polar codes, as the first provable capacity-achieving error-correcting codes,
have received much attention in recent years. However, the decoding performance
of polar codes with traditional successive-cancellation (SC) algorithm cannot
match that of the low-density parity-check (LDPC) or turbo codes. Because SC
list (SCL) decoding algorithm can significantly improve the error-correcting
performance of polar codes, design of SCL decoders is important for polar codes
to be deployed in practical applications. However, because the prior latency
reduction approaches for SC decoders are not applicable for SCL decoders, these
list decoders suffer from the long latency bottleneck. In this paper, we
propose a multi-bit-decision approach that can significantly reduce latency of
SCL decoders. First, we present a reformulated SCL algorithm that can perform
intermediate decoding of 2 bits together. The proposed approach, referred as
2-bit reformulated SCL (2b-rSCL) algorithm, can reduce the latency of SCL
decoder from (3n-2) to (2n-2) clock cycles without any performance loss. Then,
we extend the idea of 2-bit-decision to general case, and propose a general
decoding scheme that can perform intermediate decoding of any 2K bits
simultaneously. This general approach, referred as 2K-bit reformulated SCL
(2Kb-rSCL) algorithm, can reduce the overall decoding latency to as short as
n/2K-2-2 cycles. Furthermore, based on the proposed algorithms, VLSI
architectures for 2b-rSCL and 4b-rSCL decoders are synthesized. Compared with a
prior SCL decoder, the proposed (1024, 512) 2b-rSCL and 4b-rSCL decoders can
achieve 21% and 60% reduction in latency, 1.66 times and 2.77 times increase in
coded throughput with list size 2, and 2.11 times and 3.23 times increase in

Markowitz's Ph.D. thesis prepared the ground for the mathematical theory of

modeled by a random variable with an elliptical distribution and the notion of
portfolio risk is described by an appropriate risk measure. In this paper, we
propose new stochastic models for the asset returns that are based on Jumps-
Diffusion (J-D) distributions. This family of distributions are more compatible
with stylized features of asset returns. On the other hand, in the past
decades, we find attempts in the literature to use well-known risk measures,
such as Value at Risk and Expected Shortfall, in this context. Unfortunately,
one drawback with these previous approaches is that no explicit formulas are
available and numerical approximations are used to solve the optimization
problem. In this paper, we propose to use a new coherent risk measure,
so-called, Entropic Value at Risk(EVaR), in the optimization problem. For
certain models, including a jump-diffusion distribution, this risk measure
yields an explicit formula for the objective function so that the optimization
problem can be solved without resorting to numerical approximations.

using the 4 meter Visible and Infrared Survey Telescope for Astronomy (VISTA).
The VVV survey covers the Milky Way bulge and an adjacent section of the disk,
and one of the principal objectives is to search for new star clusters within
previously unreachable obscured parts of the Galaxy.
  The primary motivation behind this work is to discover and analyze obscured
star clusters in the direction of the inner Galactic disk and bulge. Regions of
the inner disk and bulge covered by the VVV survey were visually inspected
using composite JHKs color images to select new cluster candidates on the basis
of apparent overdensities. DR1, DR2, CASU, and PSF photometry of 10x10 arcmin
fields centered on each candidate cluster were used to construct
color-magnitude and color-color diagrams. Follow-up spectroscopy of the
brightest members of several cluster candidates was obtained in order to
clarify their nature.
  We report the discovery of 58 new infrared cluster candidates. Fundamental
parameters such as age, distance, and metallicity were determined for 20 of the
most populous clusters.

Subaru large-area narrowband survey. The systemic redshift of OIIB10 is
$z=1.18$ securely determined with [OIII]$\lambda\lambda4959,5007$ and H$\beta$
emission lines. We identify FeII$\lambda$2587 and MgII$\lambda\lambda$2796,2804
absorption lines blueshifted from the systemic redshift by $80\pm50$ and
$260\pm40$ km s$^{-1}$, respectively, which indicate gas outflow from OIIB10
with the velocity of $\sim 80-260$ km s$^{-1}$. This outflow velocity is
comparable with the escape velocity, $250\pm140$ km s$^{-1}$, estimated under
the assumption of a singular isothermal halo potential profile. Some fraction
of the outflowing gas could escape from the halo of OIIB10, suppressing
OIIB10's star-formation activity. We estimate a mass loading factor, $\eta$,
that is a ratio of mass outflow rate to star-formation rate, and obtain
$\eta>0.8\pm 0.1$ which is relatively high compared with low-$z$ starbursts
including U/LIRGs and AGNs. The major energy source of the outflow is unclear
with the available data. Although no signature of AGN is found in the X-ray
data, OIIB10 falls in the AGN/star-forming composite region in the line
diagnostic diagrams. It is possible that the outflow is powered by star
formation and a type-2 AGN with narrow FWHM emission line widths of $70-130$ km
s$^{-1}$. This is the first detailed spectroscopic study of oxygen-line blobs,
which includes the analyses of the escape velocity, the mass loading factor,
and the presence of an AGN, and a significant step to understanding the nature
of oxygen-line blobs and the relation with gas outflow and star-formation

Protocol (SCTP) is the standard transport-layer solution to enable CMT in
multihomed communication environments. However, delivering high-quality
streaming video with the existing CMT solutions still remains problematic due
to the stringent QoS (Quality of Service) requirements and path asymmetry in
heterogeneous wireless networks. In this paper, we advance the state of the art
by introducing video distortion into the decision process of multipath data
transfer. The proposed Distortion-Aware Concurrent Multipath Transfer (CMT-DA)
solution includes three phases: 1) per-path status estimation and congestion
control; 2) quality-optimal video flow rate allocation; 3) delay and loss
controlled data retransmission. The term `flow rate allocation' indicates
dynamically picking appropriate access networks and assigning the transmission
rates. We analytically formulate the data distribution over multiple
communication paths to minimize the end-to-end video distortion and derive the
solution based on the utility maximization theory. The performance of the
proposed CMT-DA is evaluated through extensive semi-physical emulations in
Exata involving H.264 video streaming. Experimental results show that CMT-DA
outperforms the reference schemes in terms of video PSNR (Peak Signal-to-Noise

regarded as a network of three coincident but misaligned interferometric
detectors. We investigate its event detection rate and its parameter accuracies

discriminate two polarization modes of a short-duration GW signal even with a
single antenna thanks to having three independent outputs, it improves the
detection rate and the accuracies of waveform parameters drastically.

years for its compressive representation and ease of image processing and
visualization. However, little work has been done on how to faithfully recover
image intensities from a triangulated mesh of an image, a process also known as
image restoration or decoding from meshes. The existing methods such as linear
interpolation, least-square interpolation, or interpolation based on radial
basis functions (RBFs) work to some extent, but often yield blurred features
(edges, corners, etc.). The main reason for this problem is due to the
isotropically-defined Euclidean distance that is taken into consideration in
these methods, without considering the anisotropicity of feature intensities in
an image. Moreover, most existing methods use intensities defined at mesh nodes
whose intensities are often ambiguously defined on or near image edges (or
feature boundaries). In the current paper, a new method of restoring an image
from its triangulation representation is proposed, by utilizing anisotropic
radial basis functions (ARBFs). This method considers not only the geometrical
(Euclidean) distances but also the local feature orientations (anisotropic
intensities). Additionally, this method is based on the intensities of mesh
faces instead of mesh nodes and thus provides a more robust restoration. The
two strategies together guarantee excellent feature-preserving restoration of
an image with arbitrary super-resolutions from its triangulation
representation, as demonstrated by various experiments provided in the paper.

by Subaru/HDS, with an aim of investigating the nature of surface Be contents
in these evolved giants; e.g., dependence upon stellar parameters, degree of
peculiarity along with its origin and build-up timing. We found that Be is
considerably deficient (to widely different degree from star to star) in the
photosphere of these evolved giants by ~1-3 dex (or more) compared to the
initial abundance. While the resulting Be abundances (A(Be)) appear to weakly
depend upon T_eff, log g, [Fe/H], M, age, and v_sin i, this may be attributed
to the metallicity dependence of A(Be) coupled with the mutual correlation
between these stellar parameters, since such tendencies almost disappear in the
metallicity-scaled Be abundance ([Be/Fe]). By comparing the Be abundances (as
well as their correlations with Li and C) to the recent theoretical predictions
based on sophisticated stellar evolution calculations, we concluded that such a
considerable extent/diversity of Be deficit is difficult to explain only by the
standard theory of first dredge-up in the envelope of red giants, and that some
extra mixing process (such as rotational or thermohaline mixing) must be
responsible, which presumably starts to operate already in the main-sequence
phase. This view is supported by the fact that appreciable Be depletion is seen
in less evolved intermediate-mass B-A type stars near to the main sequence.

$\eta = 0.0000(2)$, and accordingly, $\beta /\nu_\perp = 0.5000(6)$. Our

for $\beta/\nu_\perp$, however, is consistent with $\frac{1}{2}$, which is
believed to be exact.

success- ful studies, TEM has a number of serious weaknesses in use. The major
drawback is; the masks are predefined therefore they cannot be adapted to

to over- come this disadvantage of TEM by using adaptive masks by adjusting the

the basic idea is to fix a constant $q\propto x^{1-\varepsilon}$, pick a
uniformly random $a<q$ coprime to $q$, and choose $p$ of the form $a+t\cdot q$,
where only $t$ is updated if the primality test fails. We prove that variants
of this approach provide prime generation algorithms requiring few random bits
and whose output distribution is close to uniform, under less and less
expensive assumptions: first a relatively strong conjecture by H.L. Montgomery,
made precise by Friedlander and Granville; then the Extended Riemann

convex real projective structures on surfaces. We describe in particular how
the set of (Hilbert) lengths of simple closed curves is used in a
parametrization of the deformation space in analogy with the classical
Fenchel-Nielsen parameters of Teichm\""uller space (work of Goldman). We then
mention parameters of this deformation space that arise in the work of Hitchin
on the character variety of representations of the fundamental group of the
surface in $\mathrm{SL}(3,\mathbb{R})$. In this character variety, the
component of the character variety that corresponds to projective structures is
identified with the vector space of pairs of holomorphic quadratic and cubic
differentials over a fixed Riemann surface. Labourie and Loftin (independently)
obtained parameter spaces that use the cubic differentials and affine spheres.
We then display some similarities and differences between Hilbert geometry and
hyperbolic geometry using geodesic currents and topological entropy. Finally,
we discuss geodesic flows associated to Hilbert metrics and compactifications
of spaces of convex real projective structures on surfaces. This makes another
analogy with works done on the Teichm\""uller space of the surface.

ionic cross-links form between pectin chains, giving rise to a gel network in
dilute solution. In this work, dynamic light scattering (DLS) is employed to
study the microscopic dynamics of the fractal aggregates (flocs) that
constitute the gels, while rheological measurements are performed to study the
process of gel rupture. As calcium salt concentration is increased, DLS
experiments reveal that the polydispersities of the flocs increase
simultaneously with the characteristic relaxation times of the gel network.
Above a critical salt concentration, the flocs become interlinked to form a
reaction-limited fractal gel network. Rheological studies demonstrate that the
limits of the linear rheological response and the critical stresses required to
rupture these networks both decrease with increase in salt concentration. These
features indicate that the ion-mediated pectin gels studied here lie in a
`strong link' regime that is characterised by inter-floc links that are
stronger than intra-floc links. A scaling analysis of the experimental data
presented here demonstrates that the elasticities of the individual fractal
flocs exhibit power-law dependences on the added salt concentration. We
conclude that when pectin and salt concentrations are both increased, the
number of fractal flocs of pectin increases simultaneously with the density of
crosslinks, giving rise to very large values of the bulk elastic modulus.

fluctuation theorem (FT) for the heat is found not to hold with the equilibrium
initial ensemble, while the FT for the work holds. This reveals an intriguing
effect of everlasting initial memory stored in rare events. We revisit the

Compared with the keyword based search, semantic search is used to excavate the
latent semantics information and help users find the information items that

search which combines Multi-Categorization Semantic Analysis with
personalization technology. The MCSA approach can classify documents into
multiple categories, which is distinct from the existing approaches of
classifying documents into a single category. Then, the search history and
personal information for users are significantly considered in analysing and
matching the original search result by Term Vector DataBase. A series of
personalization algorithms are proposed to match personal information and
search history. At last, the related experiments are made to validate the
effectiveness and efficiency of our method. The experimental results show that
our method based on MCSA and personalization outperforms some existing methods
with the higher search accuracy and the lower extra time cost.

with dark matter subhaloes in cosmological $N$-body simulations of MW-mass
haloes suggest that such subhaloes, if they exist, are occupied by satellites
in a stochastic fashion. We examine how inefficient massive star formation and
associated supernova feedback in high-redshift progenitors of present-day
low-mass subhaloes might contribute to this stochasticity. Using a Monte Carlo
approach to follow the assembly histories of present-day low-mass haloes with
$10^7 \lesssim M \leq 10^{10}$ ${\rm M}_{\odot}$, we identify when cooling and
star formation is likely to proceed, and observe that haloes with present-day
masses $\lesssim 10^9 {\rm M}_{\odot}$ never grow sufficiently massive to
support atomic hydrogen line cooling. Noting that the star formation timescale
decreases sharply with stellar mass as $t_{\rm PMS} \propto m_{\ast}^{-2.5}$,
we argue that, should the conditions for high mass star formation arise in
low-mass haloes, the ensuing supernovae are likely to disrupt ongoing
lower-mass star formation and unbind gas within the halo. This potentially
star-forming gas is unlikely to be replenished in lower mass haloes because of,
e.g. cosmological reionization, and so we expect galaxy formation to be stymied
in a manner that depends on host halo assembly history and the efficiency and
timing of star formation in proto-galaxies, which we illustrate using a Monte
Carlo model. Based on these simple physical arguments, we assert that
stochasticity of star formation and feedback is an essential but overlooked
ingredient in modelling galaxy formation on the smallest scales.

not only due to heavy tails of noise pulses, which are distributed according to

Consequently, 2D systems are described by a whole family of Langevin and
fractional diffusion equations. Solutions of these equations bear some common
properties but also can be very different. It is demonstrated that also for 2D

This fact led to appearance of a number works where authors are investigating
various probability distributions for approximation of empirical distributions

are essential shortcoming of these probability laws. Besides, expression of

In the work the class of fractional stable distributions (FSD) are described.
This class of distributions is limit distribution of sum independent identical

this fact allow us to apply their for approximation of experimental densities

SSP-equivalent metallicity of stars along the radius in 12 targets. The
resulting averaged ages of the stellar population in bulges and discs cover an
entire range of possible values from 1.5 to 15 Gyr which indicates the absence
of a certain formation epoch for the structural components in the isolated

could have been formed at a redshift of $z>2$ as well as only a few billion
years ago. Unlike S0 galaxies in more dense environments, the isolated galaxies
typically have the same age of stars in the bulges and discs. The disc-embedded
lenses and rings of increased stellar brightness, identified from the
photometry in 7 of 11 galaxies, do not differ strongly from the stellar discs

communities in situ, it allows their functional and taxonomic characterization
and to recover sequences from uncultured taxa. For communities of up to medium
diversity, e.g. excluding environments such as soil, this is often achieved by
a combination of sequence assembly and binning, where sequences are grouped
into 'bins' representing taxa of the underlying microbial community from which
they originate. Assignment to low-ranking taxonomic bins is an important
challenge for binning methods as is scalability to Gb-sized datasets generated
with deep sequencing techniques. One of the best available methods for the
recovery of species bins from an individual metagenome sample is the
expert-trained PhyloPythiaS package, where a human expert decides on the taxa
to incorporate in a composition-based taxonomic metagenome classifier and
identifies the 'training' sequences using marker genes directly from the
sample. Due to the manual effort involved, this approach does not scale to
multiple metagenome samples and requires substantial expertise, which
researchers who are new to the area may not have. With these challenges in
mind, we have developed PhyloPythiaS+, a successor to our previously described
method PhyloPythia(S). The newly developed + component performs the work
previously done by the human expert. PhyloPythiaS+ also includes a new k-mer
counting algorithm, which accelerated k-mer counting 100-fold and reduced the
overall execution time of the software by a factor of three. Our software
allows to analyze Gb-sized metagenomes with inexpensive hardware, and to
recover species or genera-level bins with low error rates in a fully automated

challenging, since several high-power wireless communication systems coexist
with UWB signals. In the literature, cyclic features are exploited for signal
detection. However, the high computational complexity of conventional cyclic
feature based detectors burdens the receivers. In this paper, we propose
computationally efficient detectors using the specific cyclic features of UWB

system parameters are revealed. Then, some constant false alarm rate detectors
are proposed based on the estimated cyclic autocorrelation functions (CAFs).
The proposed detectors have low complexities compared to the existing ones.
Extensive simulation results indicate that the proposed detectors achieve a
good balance between the detection performance and the computational complexity
in various scenarios, such as multipath environments, colored noise, and NB

this analysis show that the source exhibits dramatic spectral variability, from
a typical unabsorbed Seyfert 1 type spectrum to a Compton-thin absorbed state,
on time scales of ~5 years. This extreme change in spectral shape can be
attributed to variations in the column density and covering fraction of a
neutral absorbing medium attenuating the emission from the central continuum
source. Evidence for Compton reflection of the intrinsic nuclear emission is
present in each of the spectra, though this feature is most prominent in the
low-state spectra, where the associated Fe emission line complex is clearly
visible. In addition to the variable absorbing medium, a warm absorber
component has been detected in each spectral state. Optical spectroscopy
concurrent with the 2010 XMM-Newton observation campaign have detected the
presence of broad optical emission lines during an X-ray absorption event.From
the analysis of both X-ray and optical spectroscopic data, it has been inferred
that the X-ray spectral variability is a result of obscuration of the central
emission region by a clumpy absorber covering >80 per cent of the source with
an average column density of NH ~7x10^{23} cm^{-2}, and which is located
outside the broad line region at a distance from the central source consistent

neighborhood graph built on top of our data points which is designed to be
attracted by high density regions. The strength of this attraction is
controlled by a temperature parameter $\beta > 0$. The membership of a point to
a given cluster is then the probability for the random walk to hit the
corresponding cluster core before any other. While many properties of random
walks (such as hitting times, commute distances, etc\dots) have been shown to
enventually encode purely local information when the number of data points
grows, we show that the regularization introduced by the use of cluster cores
solves this issue. Empirically, we show how the choice of $\beta$ influences
the behavior of our algorithm: for small values of $\beta$ the result is close
to hard mode-seeking whereas when $\beta$ is close to $1$ the result is similar
to the output of a (fuzzy) spectral clustering. Finally, we demonstrate the
scalability of our approach by providing the fuzzy clustering of a protein

identify noncoding RNA elements in bacterial and archaeal genomes is hampered
by the difficulty of de novo identification. The emergence of new technologies
for characterizing transcriptome outputs, notably RNA-seq, are improving
noncoding RNA identification and expression quantification. However, a major
challenge is to robustly distinguish functional outputs from transcriptional
noise. To establish whether annotation of existing transcriptome data has
effectively captured all functional outputs, we analysed over 400 publicly
available RNA-seq datasets spanning 37 different Archaea and Bacteria. Using
comparative tools, we identify close to a thousand highly-expressed candidate
noncoding RNAs. However, our analyses reveal that capacity to identify
noncoding RNA outputs is strongly dependent on phylogenetic sampling.
Surprisingly, and in stark contrast to protein-coding genes, the phylogenetic
window for effective use of comparative methods is perversely narrow:
aggregating public datasets only produced one phylogenetic cluster where these
tools could be used to robustly separate unannotated noncoding RNAs from a null
hypothesis of transcriptional noise. Our results show that for the full
potential of transcriptomics data to be realized, a change in experimental
design is paramount: effective transcriptomics requires phylogeny-aware

their internal structure. In Newtonian theory, the gravitational potential of a
rotating star can be fully described by an infinite number of multipole moments
of its mass distribution. Recently, this infinite number of moments for
uniformly-rotating stars were shown semi-analytically to be expressible in
terms of just the first three: the mass, the spin, and the quadrupole moment of
the star. The relations between the various lower multipole moments were
additionally shown to depend weakly on the equation of state, when considering
neutron stars and assuming single polytropic equations of state. Here we extend
this result in two ways. First, we show that the universality also holds for
realistic equations of state, thus relaxing the need to use single polytropes.
Second, we derive purely analytical universal relations by perturbing the
equations of structure about an $n=0$ polytrope that reproduce semi-analytic
results to $\mathcal{O}(1\%)$. We also find that the linear-order perturbation
vanishes in some cases, which provides further evidence and a deeper
understanding of the universality.

strictly less powerful than codes satisfying either one of the constraints, and
therefore provide a tighter bound for unassisted codes. Furthermore,
PPT-preserving non-signalling codes can send one qubit perfectly over two uses

  Quality Assurance",,,,,"cs.GT cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Consider a requester who wishes to crowdsource a series of identical binary
labeling tasks to a pool of workers so as to achieve an assured accuracy for
each task, in a cost optimal way. The workers are heterogeneous with unknown
but fixed qualities and their costs are private. The problem is to select for
each task an optimal subset of workers so that the outcome obtained from the
selected workers guarantees a target accuracy level. The problem is a
challenging one even in a non strategic setting since the accuracy of
aggregated label depends on unknown qualities. We develop a novel multi-armed
bandit (MAB) mechanism for solving this problem. First, we propose a framework,
Assured Accuracy Bandit (AAB), which leads to an MAB algorithm, Constrained
Confidence Bound for a Non Strategic setting (CCB-NS). We derive an upper bound
on the number of time steps the algorithm chooses a sub-optimal set that
depends on the target accuracy level and true qualities. A more challenging
situation arises when the requester not only has to learn the qualities of the
workers but also elicit their true costs. We modify the CCB-NS algorithm to
obtain an adaptive exploration separated algorithm which we call { \em
Constrained Confidence Bound for a Strategic setting (CCB-S)}. CCB-S algorithm
produces an ex-post monotone allocation rule and thus can be transformed into
an ex-post incentive compatible and ex-post individually rational mechanism
that learns the qualities of the workers and guarantees a given target accuracy
level in a cost optimal way. We provide a lower bound on the number of times
any algorithm should select a sub-optimal set and we see that the lower bound
matches our upper bound upto a constant factor. We provide insights on the
practical implementation of this framework through an illustrative example and
we show the efficacy of our algorithms through simulations.

toric manifolds, for which Floer theory and quantum cohomology are defined. The
class includes Fano toric negative line bundles, and it allows blow-ups along
fixed point sets. We prove closed-string mirror symmetry for this class of
manifolds: the Jacobian ring of the superpotential is the symplectic cohomology
(not the quantum cohomology). Moreover, SH(M) is obtained from QH(M) by
localizing at the toric divisors. We give explicit presentations of SH(M) and
QH(M), using ideas of Batyrev, McDuff and Tolman. Assuming that the
superpotential is Morse (or a milder semisimplicity assumption), we prove that
the wrapped Fukaya category for this class of manifolds satisfies the toric
generation criterion, i.e. is split-generated by the natural Lagrangian torus
fibres of the moment map with suitable holonomies. In particular, the wrapped
category is compactly generated and cohomologically finite. The proof uses a
deformation argument, via a generic generation theorem and an argument about
continuity of eigenspaces. We also prove that for any closed Fano toric
manifold, if the superpotential is Morse (or a milder semisimplicity
assumption) then the Fukaya category satisfies the toric generation criterion.
The key ingredients are non-vanishing results for the open-closed string map,
using tools from the paper by Ritter-Smith (we also prove a conjecture from
that paper that any monotone toric negative line bundle contains a
non-displaceable monotone Lagrangian torus). We also need to extend the class
of Hamiltonians for which the maximum principle holds for symplectic manifolds
conical at infinity, thus extending the class of Hamiltonian circle actions for
which invertible elements can be constructed in SH(M).

with fundamental applications in physics and in single molecule cell biology.
Force measurements are performed by converting the stiffness response to
displacement of trapped transparent microspheres, employed as force
transducers. Usually, calibration is indirect, by comparison with fluid drag
forces. This can lead to discrepancies by sizable factors. Progress achieved in
a program aiming at absolute calibration, conducted over the past fifteen
years, is briefly reviewed. Here we overcome its last major obstacle, a
theoretical overestimation of the peak stiffness, within the most employed
range for applications, and we perform experimental validation. The discrepancy
is traced to the effect of primary aberrations of the optical system, which are
now included in the theory. All required experimental parameters are readily
accessible. Astigmatism, the dominant effect, is measured by analyzing
reflected images of the focused laser spot, adapting frequently employed video
microscopy techniques. Combined with interface spherical aberration, it reveals
a previously unknown window of instability for trapping. Comparison with
experimental data leads to an overall agreement within error bars, with no
fitting, for a broad range of microsphere radii, from the Rayleigh regime to
the ray optics one, for different polarizations and trapping heights, including
all commonly employed parameter domains. Besides signalling full
first-principles theoretical understanding of optical tweezers operation, the
results may lead to improved instrument design and control over experiments, as

model, atomic fine structure and two-dimensional electron gases. This paper
introduces a theoretical framework that allows for the efficient determination
of the eigenenergies and eigenstates of a harmonically trapped two-atom system
with short-range interaction subject to an equal mixture of Rashba and
Dresselhaus spin-orbit coupling created through Raman coupling of atomic
hyperfine states. Energy spectra for experimentally relevant parameter
combinations are presented and future extensions of the approach are discussed.

an observations vector. The affine feasibility problem with sparsity and
nonnegativity ($AFP_{SN}$ for short) is to find a sparse and nonnegative vector
$x\in \mathbb{R}^N$ with $Ax=b$ if such $x$ exists. In this paper, we focus on
establishment of optimization approach to solving the $AFP_{SN}$. By discussing
tangent cone and normal cone of sparse constraint, we give the first necessary
optimality conditions, $\alpha$-Stability, T-Stability and N-Stability, and the
second necessary and sufficient optimality conditions for the related
minimization problems with the $AFP_{SN}$. By adopting Armijo-type stepsize
rule, we present a framework of gradient support projection algorithm for the
$AFP_{SN}$ and prove its full convergence when matrix $A$ is $s$-regular. By
doing some numerical experiments, we show the excellent performance of the new
algorithm for the $AFP_{SN}$ without and with noise.

on noisy and partial sensory observations. Many behaviors leading to decision
mak- ing and action selection in a closed loop setting are naturally phrased
within a control theoretic framework. Within the framework of optimal Control
Theory, one is usually given a cost function which is minimized by selecting a
control law based on the observations. While in standard control settings the
sensors are assumed fixed, biological systems often gain from the extra
flexibility of optimiz- ing the sensors themselves. However, this sensory
adaptation is geared towards control rather than perception, as is often
assumed. In this work we show that sen- sory adaptation for control differs
from sensory adaptation for perception, even for simple control setups. This
implies, consistently with recent experimental results, that when studying
sensory adaptation, it is essential to account for the task being performed.

Survey (SDSS) Type 1 quasars and the cosmic infrared background (CIB) measured
by Herschel. The distribution of the quasars at 0.15<z<3.5 covers the redshift
range where we expect most of the CIB to originate. We detect the sub-mm
emission of the quasars, which dominates on small scales, as well as correlated
emission from dusty star-forming galaxies (DSFGs) dominant on larger scales.
The mean sub-mm flux densities of the DR7 quasars (median redshift <z>=1.4) is
$11.1^{+1.6}_{-1.4}$, $7.1^{+1.6}_{-1.3}$ and $3.6^{+1.4}_{-1.0}$ mJy at 250,
350 and 500 microns, respectively, while the mean sub-mm flux densities of the
DR9 quasars (<z>=2.5) is $5.7^{+0.7}_{-0.6}$, $5.0^{+0.8}_{-0.7}$ and
$1.8^{+0.5}_{-0.4}$ mJy. We find that the correlated sub-mm emission includes
both the emission from satellite DSFGs in the same halo as the central quasar
and the emission from DSFGs in separate halos (correlated with the
quasar-hosting halo). The amplitude of the one-halo term is ~10 times smaller
than the sub-mm emission of the quasars, implying the the satellites have a
lower star-formation rate than the quasars. The satellite fraction for the DR7
quasars is $0.008^{+0.008}_{-0.005}$ and the host halo mass scale for the
central and satellite quasars is $10^{12.36\pm0.87}$ M$_{\odot}$ and
$10^{13.60\pm0.38}$ M$_{\odot}$, respectively. The satellite fraction of the
DR9 quasars is $0.065^{+0.021}_{-0.031}$ and the host halo mass scale for the
central and satellite quasars is $10^{12.29\pm0.62}$ M$_{\odot}$ and
$10^{12.82\pm0.39}$ M$_{\odot}$, respectively. Thus, the typical halo
environment of the SDSS Type 1 quasars is found to be similar to that of DSFGs,
which supports the generally accepted view that dusty starburst and quasar
activity are evolutionarily linked.

breaking rotational symmetry to allow for the exact restoration of the angular
momentum at any truncation order. The main objective relates to the description
of near-degenerate finite quantum systems with an open-shell character. As
such, the newly developed many-body formalism offers a wealth of potential
applications and further extensions dedicated to the ab initio description of,
e.g., doubly open-shell atomic nuclei and molecule dissociation. The formalism,
which encompasses both single-reference coupled cluster theory and projected
Hartree-Fock theory as particular cases, permits the computation of usual sets
of connected diagrams while consistently incorporating static correlations
through the highly non-perturbative restoration of rotational symmetry.
Interestingly, the yrast spectroscopy of the system, i.e. the lowest energy
associated with each angular momentum, is accessed within a single calculation.
A key difficulty presently overcome relates to the necessity to handle
generalized energy {\it and} norm kernels for which naturally terminating
coupled-cluster expansions could be eventually obtained. The present work
focuses on $SU(2)$ but can be extended to any (locally) compact Lie group and
to discrete groups, such as most point groups. In particular, the formalism
will be soon generalized to $U(1)$ symmetry associated with particle number
conservation. This is relevant to Bogoliubov coupled cluster theory that was
recently formulated and applied to singly open-shell nuclei.

switched on and off repeatedly with a high frequency (up to 100kHz) duty cycled
signal. By means of tissue modeling that includes the dynamic properties of
both the tissue material as well as the axon membrane, it is first shown that
switched-mode stimulation depolarizes the cell membrane in a similar way as
classical constant amplitude stimulation. These findings are subsequently
verified using in vitro experiments in which the response of a Purkinje cell is
measured due to a stimulation signal in the molecular layer of the cerebellum
of a mouse. For this purpose a stimulator circuit is developed that is able to
produce a monophasic high frequency switched-mode stimulation signal. The
results confirm the modeling by showing that switched-mode stimulation is able
to induce similar responses in the Purkinje cell as classical stimulation using
a constant current source. This conclusion opens up possibilities for novel
stimulation designs that can improve the performance of the stimulator
circuitry. Care has to be taken to avoid losses in the system due to the higher
operating frequency.

More pragmatically, they are molecules in principle difficult to synthetize in
the harsh interstellar environments and, therefore, a crucial test for
astrochemical models. Current models assume that several COMs are synthesised
on the lukewarm grain surfaces ($\gtrsim$30-40 K), and released in the gas
phase at dust temperatures $\gtrsim$100 K. However, recent detections of COMs
in $\lesssim$20 K gas demonstrate that we still need important pieces to
complete the puzzle of the COMs formation. We present here a complete census of
the oxygen and nitrogen bearing COMs, previously detected in different ISM
regions, towards the solar type protostar IRAS16293-2422. The census was
obtained from the millimeter-submillimeter unbiased spectral survey TIMASSS.
Six COMs, out of the 29 searched for, were detected: methyl cyanide, ketene,
acetaldehyde, formamide, dimethyl ether, and methyl formate. The multifrequency
analysis of the last five COMs provides clear evidence that they are present in
the cold ($\lesssim$30 K) envelope of IRAS16293-2422, with abundances 0.03-2
$\times 10^{-10}$. Our data do not allow to support the hypothesis that the
COMs abundance increases with increasing dust temperature in the cold envelope,
as expected if COMs were predominately formed on the lukewarm grain surfaces.
Finally, when considering also other ISM sources, we find a strong correlation
over five orders of magnitude, between the methyl formate and dimethyl ether
and methyl formate and formamide abundances, which may point to a link between
these two couples of species, in cold and warm gas.

diffusion. They played a pivotal role during recent social uprisings and
political mobilizations across the world. Here we present a study of the Gezi
Park movement in Turkey through the lens of Twitter. We analyze over 2.3
million tweets produced during the 25 days of protest occurred between May and
June 2013. We first characterize the spatio-temporal nature of the conversation
about the Gezi Park demonstrations, showing that similarity in trends of
discussion mirrors geographic cues. We then describe the characteristics of the
users involved in this conversation and what roles they played. We study how
roles and individual influence evolved during the period of the upheaval. This
analysis reveals that the conversation becomes more democratic as events
unfold, with a redistribution of influence over time in the user population. We
conclude by observing how the online and offline worlds are tightly
intertwined, showing that exogenous events, such as political speeches or
police actions, affect social media conversations and trigger changes in
individual behavior.

by relying on the Weinberg-Tomozawa theorem. The transition amplitudes between

extending the Kroll-Ruderman term for pion photoproduction replacing the photon

the representation ring $r(KZ_{n}/J^{d})$, we completely determine its
generators and the relations of generators via the method of Pascal triangle.
For the derived ring $dr(KZ_{n}/J^{2})$(i.e., $d=2$), we determine its
generators and give the relations of generators. In these two aspects, the
polynomial characterizations of the representation ring and the derived ring
are both given.

in its microstructure. Nano-scale secondary ion mass spectrometer isotope

isotopic compositions, including anomalous shell-like structures. Transmission
electron microscope studies reveal a nanocrystalline core surrounded by a
turbostratic graphite mantle, the first reported nanocrystalline core from a
low-density SN graphite grain. Electron diffraction analysis shows that the
nanocrystalline core consists of randomly oriented 2-4 nm graphene particles,
similar to those in cores of high-density (HD) presolar graphite grains from
asymptotic giant branch stars. G6's core also exhibits evidence for planar
stacking of these graphene nano-sheets with a domain size up to 4.5 nm, which
was unobserved in the nanocrystalline cores of HD graphite grains. We also
report on X-ray absorption near-edge structure measurements of G6. The complex
isotopic- and micro-structure of G6 provides evidence for mixing and/or

is close enough to the physical edge of the cylinder such that the edge mode
spatially extends over the cut. This effect is suppressed for parameter choices

perfectly localized edge mode, the entanglement spectrum is gapless even if the
smaller partition consists of a single edge row. For the single-row cut, we

$k$. Moreover, we illustrate the relation between the valued Ext-quiver and the
