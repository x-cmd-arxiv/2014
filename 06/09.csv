using stellar models and show that the contribution ranges from 6\% from the
outer 0.1\% of the radius to 30\% from the outer 5\%. and therefore argue that
the large separation should not be used as a constraint on surface layer
independent model fitting. The mass and luminosity are independent of the outer
layers and can be used as constraints, the mass being determined from binarity
or from surface gravity and radius. The radius can be used as a constraint but
with enhanced error estimates. We briefly consider the determination of the
large separation for $\alpha$ Cen A and find that mass derived from surface
gravity is closer to the binary mass than that derived from the large

the largest values of the ratio vLv(0.25 um)/vLv(7.8 um) with a maximum ratio

heterogeneous agents operating in an undirected graph, which differ in the time
they require to traverse particular edges of the graph. Each agent knows the
complete topology of the graph and the initial positions of both agents. The
agent also knows its own traversal times for all of the edges of the graph, but
is unaware of the corresponding traversal times for the other agent. The goal
of the agents is to meet on an edge or a node of the graph. In this scenario,
we study the time required by the agents to meet, compared to the meeting time
$T_{OPT}$ in the offline scenario in which the agents have complete knowledge
about each others speed characteristics. When no additional assumptions are
made, we show that rendezvous in our model can be achieved after time $O(n

the best possible. However, we prove that the rendezvous time can be reduced to
$\Theta (T_{OPT})$ when the agents are allowed to exchange $\Theta(n)$ bits of
information at the start of the rendezvous process. We then show that under
some natural assumption about the traversal times of edges, the hardness of the
heterogeneous rendezvous problem can be substantially decreased, both in terms
of time required for rendezvous without communication, and the communication
complexity of achieving rendezvous in time $\Theta (T_{OPT})$.

numerical evidence that SARP can effectively be implemented with adaptive step
size control and does not require access to gradient or advanced line search

evolution path to bias the search. This algorithm can be generalized to a
family of low memory schemes, with complexity $\Theta(mn)$ per iteration,
following a recent approach by Loshchilov (2014). The study shows that the
performance of CMA-EP heavily depends on the spectra of the objective function

during an external, event-driven spike. The model leads to a testable
prediction of who would become most active if a spike were to take place. This
type of information is of great interest to commercial organisations,
governments and charities, as it identifies key players who can be targeted
with information in real time when the network is most receptive. The model
takes account of the fact that dynamic interactions evolve over an underlying,
static network that records who listens to whom. The model is based on the
assumption that, in the case where the entire community has become aware of an
external news event, a key driver of activity is the motivation to participate
by responding to incoming messages. We test the model on a large scale Twitter
conversation concerning the appointment of a UK Premier League football club
manager. We also present further results for a Bundesliga football match, a
marketing event and a television programme. In each case we find that
exploiting the underlying connectivity structure improves the prediction of who
will be active during a spike. We also show how the half-life of a spike in
activity can be quantified in terms of the network size and the typical
response rate.

this paper, we investigate the impact of temporal variation of FR and QS on the
perceptual video quality. Among all possible variation patterns, we focus on
videos in which two FR's (or QS's) alternate over a fixed interval. We explore
the human responses to such variation by conducting subjective evaluation of
test videos with different variation magnitudes and frequencies. We further
analyze statistical significance of the impact of variation magnitude,
variation frequency, video content, and their interactions. By analyzing the
subjective ratings, we propose two models for predicting the quality of video

mathematical forms with a few content-dependent parameters. The models fit the
measured data very well using parameters determined by least square fitting
with the measured data. We further propose some guidelines for adaptation of FR

gradient guided condensation of atmospheric and accreting material,
preferentially depositing crust-forming refractories on the cooler farside,

allows for the ""perfect"" real-time 3D movie camera (our long term goal). The
key problem towards this goal is ambiguous line indexing: we will demonstrate
that the necessary information for unique line indexing can be acquired by two
synchronized cameras and a back projection scheme. The introduced concept
preserves high lateral resolution, since the lines are as narrow as the
sampling theorem allows, no spatial bandwidth is consumed by encoding of the
lines. In principle, the distance uncertainty is only limited by shot noise and
coherent noise. The concept can be also advantageously implemented with a
hand-guided sensor and real-time registration, for a complete and dense
3D-acquisition of complicated scenes.

done by means of (generalized) Banach-Mazur games using the Axiom of

set theory and topology often leading to mathematically precise formulations of
""fuzziness"". In measure and integration theory f.i. one defines for a ""measure

$\underline{A}$ a $\sigma$-algebra on $\Omega$ and $\mu$ a measure on

in materials are of major importance to keep exposure to personnel and to the

prediction of induced radioactivity is also essential for the design, operation
and decommissioning of a high energy electron linear accelerator. The research
of induced radioactivity focuses on the photonuclear reaction, whose giant
resonance response in the copper is ranging from 10 MeV to 28 MeV. The 200 MeV
electron linac of NSRL is one of the earliest high-energy electron linear
accelerators in P. R. China. The electrons are accelerated to 200 MeV by five
acceleration tubes and collimated by the scrapers made of copper. At present,
it is the first retired high-energy electron linear accelerator in domestic.
Its decommissioning provides an efficient way for the induced radioactivity
research of such accelerators, and is a matter of great significance to the
accumulation of the induced radioactivity experience. When the copper target is
impacted by an 158 MeV electron beam, the number of photons generated whose
energy are in the range of giant resonance response is the largest. Thus, this
paper focuses on the induced radioactivity for a copper target impacted by the
158 MeV electron beam. The slicing method is applied in the research. The
specific activity of each slice was measured at cooling times of ten months and
the results were compared with the prediction from the Monte-Carlo program
FLUKA. The simulation results are in good agreement with the measurement
results. The method by Monte Carlo simulation in this paper gives a reasonable
prediction of the induced radioactivity problem for the high-energy electron
linear accelerators, laying a foundation for the accumulation of the induced

with the following features: 1) Low-rank and error s-parsity: the incomplete
initial tagging matrix D is decomposed into the complete tagging matrix A and a
sparse error matrix E. However, instead of minimizing its nuclear norm, A is
further factor-ized into a basis matrix U and a sparse coefficient matrix V,
i.e. D=UV+E. This low-rank formulation encapsulating sparse coding enables our
algorithm to recover latent structures from noisy initial data and avoid
performing too much denoising; 2) Local reconstruction structure consistency:
to steer the completion of D, the local linear reconstruction structures in
feature space and tag space are obtained and preserved by U and V respectively.
Such a scheme could alleviate the negative effect of distances measured by
low-level features and incomplete tags. Thus, we can seek a balance between
exploiting as much information and not being mislead to suboptimal performance.
Experiments conducted on Corel5k dataset and the newly issued Flickr30Concepts

As a typical pair of elements contributes one sum and two differences, we
expect sum-dominant sets to be rare in some sense. In 2006, however, Martin and
O'Bryant showed that the proportion of sum-dominant subsets of $\{0,\dots,n\}$
is bounded below by a positive constant as $n\to\infty$. Hegarty then extended
their work and showed that for any prescribed $s,d\in\mathbb{N}_0$, the
proportion $\rho^{s,d}_n$ of subsets of $\{0,\dots,n\}$ that are missing
exactly $s$ sums in $\{0,\dots,2n\}$ and exactly $2d$ differences in
$\{-n,\dots,n\}$ also remains positive in the limit.
  We consider the following question: are such sets, characterized by their
sums and differences, similarly ubiquitous in higher dimensional spaces? We
generalize the integers in a growing interval to the lattice points in a
dilating polytope. Specifically, let $P$ be a polytope in $\mathbb{R}^D$ with
vertices in $\mathbb{Z}^D$, and let $\rho_n^{s,d}$ now denote the proportion of
subsets of $L(nP)$ that are missing exactly $s$ sums in $L(nP)+L(nP)$ and
exactly $2d$ differences in $L(nP)-L(nP)$. As it turns out, the geometry of $P$
has a significant effect on the limiting behavior of $\rho_n^{s,d}$. We define
a geometric characteristic of polytopes called local point symmetry, and show
that $\rho_n^{s,d}$ is bounded below by a positive constant as $n\to\infty$ if
and only if $P$ is locally point symmetric. We further show that the proportion
of subsets in $L(nP)$ that are missing exactly $s$ sums and at least $2d$
differences remains positive in the limit, independent of the geometry of $P$.
A direct corollary of these results is that if $P$ is additionally point
symmetric, the proportion of sum-dominant subsets of $L(nP)$ also remains
positive in the limit.

First, we present a general GSOS specification format (and a corresponding
notion of bisimulation) for non-deterministic processes with quantitative
aspects. These specifications define labelled transition systems according to
the ULTraS model, an extension of the usual LTSs where the transition relation
associates any source state and transition label with state reachability weight
functions (like, e.g., probability distributions). This format, hence called
Weight Function SOS (WFSOS), covers many known systems and their bisimulations
(e.g. PEPA, TIPP, PCSP) and GSOS formats (e.g. GSOS, Weighted GSOS,
Segala-GSOS, among others).
  The second contribution is a characterization of these systems as coalgebras
of a class of functors, parametric on the weight structure. This result allows
us to prove soundness of the WFSOS specification format, and that
bisimilarities induced by these specifications are always congruences.

individual-based model for this system needs to capture the spatial attributes
of every agent and monitor the interaction between each pair of them. As a
result, the cost of simulating this model grows exponentially as the number of
agents increases. For this reason, a patch-based model with more abstraction
but better scalability is advantageous. In a patch-based model, instead of
representing each agent separately, we model the agents in a patch as an
aggregation. This property significantly enhances the scalability of the model.
In this paper, we convert an individual-based model for a spatially distributed
network system for wild-life monitoring, ZebraNet, to a patch-based stochastic
HYPE model with accurate performance evaluation. We show the ease and
expressiveness of stochastic HYPE for patch-based modelling of hybrid systems.

approximation of the stochastic HYPE model, which can be used to investigate
the average behaviour of the modelled system over an infinite number of
simulation runs of the stochastic HYPE model.

strongly correlated with the optical luminosity in the luminosity range of
M_V=-16 to -22 mag, and the regression analysis was performed to obtain the
correlation log $\Delta t$ (days) = -2.11 -0.2 M_V assuming $\Delta t \propto

reverberation radius of broad Balmer emission lines. The interferometric radius

the difference between the flux-weighted radius and the response-weighted

manual annotation of the data is impractical; instead our data has noisy

discriminatively-trained Convnets when trained on such noisy data. We introduce
an extra noise layer into the network which adapts the network outputs to match
the noisy label distribution. The parameters of this noise layer can be
estimated as part of the training process and involve simple modifications to
current training infrastructures for deep networks. We demonstrate the
approaches on several datasets, including large scale experiments on the

estimating functions whose derivatives are of bounded variation, trend
filtering achieves the minimax optimal error rate, while other popular methods
like smoothing splines and kernels do not. Standing in the way of a more
widespread practical adoption, however, is a lack of scalable and numerically
stable algorithms for fitting trend filtering estimates. This paper presents a
highly efficient, specialized ADMM routine for trend filtering. Our algorithm
is competitive with the specialized interior point methods that are currently
in use, and yet is far more numerically robust. Furthermore, the proposed ADMM
implementation is very simple, and importantly, it is flexible enough to extend
to many interesting related problems, such as sparse trend filtering and
isotonic trend filtering. Software for our method is freely available, in both

the materials were loaded using strain control. There is paucity of results
under stress control. Here we present a new method that was carefully geared to
allow loading under stress control either at $T=0$ or at any other temperature,
using Monte-Carlo techniques. The method is applied to a model perfect
crystalline solid, to a crystalline solid contaminated with topological
defects, and to a generic glass. The highest yield stress belongs to the
crystal, the lowest to the crystal with a few defects, with the glass in
between. Although the glass is more disordered than the crystal with a few
defects, it yields stress is much higher than that of the latter. We explain
this fact
  by considering the actual microscopic interactions that are typical to glass
forming materials, pointing out the reasons for the higher cohesive nature of
the glass. The main conclusion of this paper is that the instabilities
encountered in stress-control condition are the identical saddle-node
bifurcation seen in strain-control. Accordingly one can use the latter
condition to infer about the former. Finally we discuss temperature effects and
comment on the time needed to see a stress controlled material failure.

directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) learning via bootstrap aggregating. The proposed
procedure is named as DAGBag. Specifically, an ensemble of DAGs is first
learned based on bootstrap resamples of the data and then an aggregated DAG is
derived by minimizing the overall distance to the entire ensemble. A family of
metrics based on the structural hamming distance is defined for the space of
DAGs (of a given node set) and is used for aggregation. Under the
high-dimensional-low-sample size setting, the graph learned on one data set
often has excessive number of false positive edges due to over-fitting of the
noise. Aggregation overcomes over-fitting through variance reduction and thus
greatly reduces false positives. We also develop an efficient implementation of
the hill climbing search algorithm of DAG learning which makes the proposed
method computationally competitive for the high-dimensional regime. The DAGBag
procedure is implemented in the R package dagbag.

phenomena in condensed-matter and high-energy physics. Recently, the synthetic
non-Abelian gauge fields have been created in the neutral degenerate Fermi
gases, and moreover, generate many exotic effects. All the previous predictions
can be well understood by the microscopic Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer theory. In
this work, we establish an SU(2) Ginzburg-Landau theory for degenerate Fermi
gases with the synthetic non-Abelian gauge fields. We firstly address a
fundamental problem how the non-Abelian gauge fields, imposing originally on
the Fermi atoms, affect the pairing field with no extra electric charge by a
local gauge-field theory,and then obtain the first and second SU(2)
Ginzburg-Landau equations. Based on these obtained SU(2) Ginzburg-Landau
equations, we find that the superfluid critical temperature of the intra-
(inter-) band pairing increases (decreases) linearly, when increasing the
strength of the synthetic non-Abelian gauge fields. More importantly, we
predict a novel SU(2) non-Abelian Josephson effect, which can be used to design
a new atomic superconducting quantum interference device.

increasing graph property ${\mathcal P}$, if $G \notin {\mathcal P}$ but $G
\cup \{e\} \in {\mathcal P}$ for every $e \in \binom{V}{2} \setminus E$. The
saturation game $(n, {\mathcal P})$ is played as follows. Two players, called
Mini and Max, progressively build a graph $G \subseteq K_n$, which does not
satisfy ${\mathcal P}$. Starting with the empty graph on $n$ vertices, the two
players take turns adding edges $e \in \binom{V(K_n)}{2} \setminus E(G)$, for
which $G \cup \{e\} \notin {\mathcal P}$, until no such edge exists (i.e. until
$G$ becomes ${\mathcal P}$-saturated), at which point the game is over. Max's
goal is to maximize the length of the game, whereas Mini aims to minimize it.
The score of the game, denoted by $s(n, {\mathcal P})$, is the number of edges
in $G$ at the end of the game, assuming both players follow their optimal
strategies. We prove lower and upper bounds on the score of games in which the
property the players need to avoid is being $k$-connected, having chromatic
number at least $k$, and admitting a matching of a given size. In doing so we
demonstrate that the score of certain games can be as large as the Tur\'an
number or as low as the saturation number of the respective graph property. We
also demonstrate that the score might strongly depend on the identity of the
first player to move.

to a positive-operator valued measure under a quantum measurement process $Y$
described by a completely positive instrument from the viewpoint of the
relative entropy. We establish a sufficient condition for the relative-entropy
conservation law which states that the averaged decrease in the relative
entropy of the system's observable $X$ equals the relative entropy of the
measurement outcome of $Y$, i.e. the information gain due to measurement. This
sufficient condition is interpreted as an assumption of classicality in the
sense that there exists a sufficient statistic in a joint successive
measurement of $Y$ followed by $X$ such that the probability distribution of
the statistic coincides with that of a single measurement of $X$ for the
pre-measurement state. We show that in the case when $X$ is a discrete
projection-valued measure and $Y$ is discrete, the classicality condition is
equivalent to the relative-entropy conservation for arbitrary states. The
general theory on the relative-entropy conservation is applied to typical
quantum measurement models, namely quantum non-demolition measurement,
destructive sharp measurements on two-level systems, a photon counting, a
quantum counting, homodyne and heterodyne measurements. These examples except
for the non-demolition and photon-counting measurements do not satisfy the
known Shannon-entropy conservation law proposed by Ban~(M. Ban, J. Phys. A:

Here we report a systematic study on the elastic modulus and strength of
graphene with controlled density of defects. Counter intuitively, the in-plane
Young modulus increases with increasing defect density up to almost twice the
initial value for vacancy content of ~0.2%, turning it into the stiffest
material ever reported. For higher density of vacancies, elastic modulus
decreases with defect inclusion. The initial increase in Young modulus is
explained in terms of a dependence of the elastic coefficients with the
momentum of flexural modes predicted for 2D membranes. In contrast, the
fracture strength decreases with defect density according to standard fracture
continuum models. These quantitative structure-property relationships, measured
in atmospheric conditions, are of fundamental and technological relevance and
provide guidance for applications in which graphene mechanics represents a

another measure is obtained by optimizing a quadratic functional, while the
third is given by the volume of the ellipsoid of minimal volume containing the

a special type of Riemannian manifold, the space of Symmetric Positive Definite

discriminating between covariance matrices. To this end, we propose to embed
SPD manifolds to Euclidean spaces via a diffeomorphism and extend the BoW
approach to its Riemannian version. The proposed BoW approach takes into
account the manifold geometry of SPD matrices during the generation of the
codebook and histograms. Experiments on challenging human action datasets show
that the proposed method obtains notable improvements in discrimination

to widen strongly the energy interval where one gets some knowledge about the
structure of their interaction region. Using the unitarity relation in
combination with experimental data about the elastic scattering in the
diffraction cone, it is shown how the shape and the darkness of the interaction
region of colliding protons change with increase of their energies. In
particular, the collisions become fully absorptive at small impact parameters
at LHC energies that results in some special features of inelastic processes as
well. Possible evolution of the shape from the dark core at the LHC to the
fully transparent one is discussed that implies the terminology of the black
disk would be replaced by the black torus. The parameter which determines the
opacity of central collisions also plays a crucial role in the behavior of the
differential cross section of elastic scattering outside the diffraction cone
where the predictions of all phenomenological models failed at LHC energies.
The role of the ratio of real to imaginary part of the elastic scattering
amplitude at non-forward scattering becomes decisive there as seen from the
unitarity condition. The obtained results allow to estimate this ratio outside
the diffraction cone for the first time by comparison with experiment at LHC
energies which happens to be drastically different from its values measured at
forward scattering. Moreover, the behaviors of the real and imaginary parts
separately differ in different phenomeno- logical models and in the approach
based on the unitarity condition. This problem is still waiting for its
resolution. All the conclusions are only obtained in the framework of the

incompressibility condition to eliminate the pressure, we consider the
resulting velocity-stress-vorticity approach with different kind of boundary
conditions on an annular bounded domain, and couple the underlying equations
with either one or two boundary integral equations arising from the application
of the usual and normal traces to the Green representation formula in the
exterior unbounded region. As a result, we obtain saddle point operator
equations, which are then analyzed by the well-known Babuska-Brezzi theory. We
prove the well-posedness of the continuous formulations, identifying previously
the space of solutions of the associated homogeneous problem, and specify
explicit hypotheses to be satisfied by the finite element and boundary element
subspaces in order to guarantee the stability of the respective Galerkin
schemes. In particular, following a similar analysis given recently for the
Laplacian, we are able to extend the classical Johnson & N\'ed\'elec procedure
to the present case, without assuming any restrictive smoothness requirement on
the coupling boundary, but only Lipschitz-continuity. In addition, and
differently from known approaches for the elasticity problem, we are also able
to extend the Costabel & Han coupling procedure to the 3D Stokes problem by
providing a direct proof of the required coerciveness property, that is without
argueing by contradiction, and by using the natural norm of each space instead
of mesh-dependent norms. Finally, we briefly describe concrete examples of
discrete spaces satisfying the aforementioned hypotheses.

are derived using a recent technique to derive convergent multi-infinite series
solutions for the homoclinic (heteroclinic) orbits of the traveling-wave
equations for the SPE equation, as well as for its generalized version with
arbitrary coefficients. These correspond to pulse (kink or shock) solutions
respectively of the original PDEs.
  Unlike the majority of unaccelerated convergent series, high accuracy is
attained with relatively few terms. And finally, variational methods are
employed to generate families of both regular and embedded solitary wave
solutions for the SPE PDE. The technique for obtaining the embedded solitons
incorporates several recent generalizations of the usual variational technique
and it is thus topical in itself. One unusual feature of the solitary waves
derived here is that we are able to obtain them in analytical form (within the
assumed ansatz for the trial functions). Thus, a direct error analysis is
performed, showing the accuracy of the resulting solitary waves. Given the
importance of solitary wave solutions in wave dynamics and information

such resonant aperture antenna is responsible for converting parts of the
evanescent waves into propagating waves, and delivering them to the far-field.
We also demonstrate that there are three basic requirements on the proposed

illumination. Such imaging concept of a single radar provides unique ability to
produce real-time data when an object is illuminated by broadband

scattered by an elastic body immersed in a fluid is one of central importance
in detecting and identifying submerged objects. The problem is generally
referred to as a fluid-structure interaction and is mathematically formulated
as a time-dependent transmission problem. In this paper, we consider a typical
fluid-structure interaction problem by using a coupling procedure which reduces
the problem to a nonlocal initial-boundary problem in the elastic body with a
system of integral equations on the interface between the domains occupied by
the elastic body and the fluid. We analyze this nonlocal problem by the Lubich
approach via the Laplace transform, an essential feature of which is that it
works directly on data in the time domain rather than in the transformed
domain. Our results may serve as a mathematical foundation for treating
time-dependent fluid-structure interaction problems by convolution quadrature

exoplanet host (EH) stars and their planets. While techniques for detecting
exoplanets yield properties of the planet only as a function of the properties
of the host star, hence, we must accurately determine parameters of EH stars at
first. For this reason, we constructed a grid of stellar models including
diffusion and rotation-induced extra-mixing with given ranges of input
parameters (i.e. mass, metallicity, and initial rotation rate). In addition to
the commonly used observational constraints such as the effective temperature
T_{eff}, luminosity L and metallicity [Fe/H], we added two observational
constraints, the lithium abundance log N (Li) and the rotational period
P_{rot}. These two additional observed parameters can make further constrains
on the model due to their correlations with mass, age and other stellar
properties. Hence, our estimations of fundamental parameters for these EH stars
and their planets are with higher precision than previous works. Therefore, the
combination of rotational period and lithium help us to obtain more accurate
parameters for stars, leading to an improvement of the knowledge of the
physical state about the EH stars and their planets.

consequence of the asymmetric exchange Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions that
destroy the homogeneous magnetic state and generally lead to twisted
incommensurate magnetic spin-structures. Recently, skyrmion lattices and free
skyrmions in magnetic layers of the chiral helimagnets with the
noncentrosymmetric cubic B20 crystal structure have been observed. The
stabilization of these states and their transformation properties impressively
illustrate the theoretically predicted solitonic nature of these chiral
two-dimensionally localized spin-states. This paper is mainly devoted to
numerically rigorous solutions of hexagonal skyrmion lattices for cubic
helimagnets. It justifies and extends previous approximate solutions that used
a circular cell approximation (CCA) for the calculation of the free energy of
skyrmion lattices. The theoretical results of the present paper provide a
comprehensive description of skyrmion lattice evolution in an applied magnetic
field and/or in the presence of uniaxial, cubic, and exchange anisotropy. The
low-temperature phenomenological theory with fixed modulus of magnetization,
M=const, is applied to the magnetic states in chiral magnets.

under the combined effects of migration and eccentricity damping. We also show
that, for a ratio $q$ of inner to outer masses below unity, $e_{\rm i}$ has to
pass through a value $e_{\rm i,res}$ of order 0.3 for the system to enter an
inclination-type resonance. Numerically, we confirm that such a resonance may
also be excited at another, larger, value $e_{\rm i, res} \simeq 0.6$, as found
by previous authors. A necessary condition for onset of an inclination-type
resonance is that the asymptotic equilibrium value of $e_{\rm i}$ is larger
than $e_{\rm i,res}$. We find that, for $q \le 1$, the system cannot enter an
inclination-type resonance if the ratio of eccentricity to semimajor axis
damping timescales $t_e/t_a$ is smaller than 0.2. This result still holds if
only the eccentricity of the outer planet is damped and $q \lesssim 1$. As the

loosely coupled convex optimization problems. The algorithm is based on a
primal-dual interior-point method in which we use the alternating direction
method of multipliers (ADMM) to compute the primal-dual directions at each
iteration of the method. This enables us to join the exceptional convergence
properties of primal-dual interior-point methods with the remarkable
parallelizability of ADMM. The resulting algorithm has superior computational
properties with respect to ADMM directly applied to our problem. The amount of
computations that needs to be conducted by each computing agent is far less. In
particular, the updates for all variables can be expressed in closed form,
irrespective of the type of optimization problem. The most expensive
computational burden of the algorithm occur in the updates of the primal
variables and can be precomputed in each iteration of the interior-point
method. We verify and compare our method to ADMM in numerical experiments.

is an extremely versatile molecule involved in many biological processes:
muscular contraction, synaptic plasticity, circadian rhythm, and cell cycle,
among others. The protein is structurally organised into two globular lobes,
joined by a flexible linker. Calcium modulates calmodulin activity by favoring
a conformational transition of each lobe from a closed conformation to an open
conformation. Most targets have a strong preference for one conformation over
the other, and depending on the free calcium concentration in a cell,
particular sets of targets will preferentially interact with calmodulin. In
turn, targets can increase or decrease the calcium affinity of the calmodulin
molecules to which they bind. Interestingly, experiments with the tryptic
fragments showed that most targets have a much lower affinity for the N-lobe
than for the C-lobe. Hence, the latter predominates in the formation of most
calmodulin-target complexes. We showed that a relatively simple allosteric
mechanism, based the classic MWC model, can capture the observed modulation of
both the isolated C-lobe, and intact calmodulin, by individual targets.
Moreover, our model can be naturally extended to study how the calcium affinity
of a single pool of calmodulin is modulated by a mixture of competing targets
in vivo.

tandem with measurements of $H(z)$ at lower redshifts, imply considerable
tension with the standard $\Lambda$CDM model. Our estimation of the new
diagnostic $Omh^2$ from SDSS DR9 and DR11 data, namely $Omh^2 \approx 0.122 \pm
0.01$, which is equivalent to $\Omega_{0m}h^2$ for the spatially flat
$\Lambda$CDM model, is in tension with the value $\Omega_{0m}h^2 = 0.1426 \pm

in models in which the cosmological constant was dynamically screened

digital computing efficiency and power can be improved by matching the
precision to the application. Many applications do not need the high precision
that is being used today. In particular, large gains in area- and power
efficiency could be achieved by dedicated analog realizations of approximate
computing engines. In this work, we explore the use of memristor networks for
analog approximate computation, based on a machine learning framework called
reservoir computing. Most experimental investigations on the dynamics of
memristors focus on their nonvolatile behavior. Hence, the volatility that is
present in the developed technologies is usually unwanted and it is not
included in simulation models. In contrast, in reservoir computing, volatility
is not only desirable but necessary. Therefore, in this work, we propose two
different ways to incorporate it into memristor simulation models. The first is
an extension of Strukov's model and the second is an equivalent Wiener model
approximation. We analyze and compare the dynamical properties of these models
and discuss their implications for the memory and the nonlinear processing
capacity of memristor networks. Our results indicate that device variability,
increasingly causing problems in traditional computer design, is an asset in
the context of reservoir computing. We conclude that, although both models
could lead to useful memristor based reservoir computing systems, their
computational performance will differ. Therefore, experimental modeling
research is required for the development of accurate volatile memristor models.

particle mass. In practice, the ratio between fluid and particle mass
determines the strength of the force transfer in the coupling. The integration

Assuming that the matter content is a conformally coupled massive scalar field
on de Sitter spacetime, this framework has been applied to compute the power
spectrum of the quantum fluctuations and to show that it is almost
scale-invariant. We test the robustness and the range of applicability of this
proposal by applying it to a less idealized, but physically motivated,
scenario, namely we consider Friedmann-Robertson-Walker spacetimes which behave
only asymptotically in the past as a de Sitter spacetime. We show in particular
that, under this new assumption and independently from any renormalization
freedom, the power spectrum associated to scalar perturbations of the metric
behaves consistently with an almost scale-invariant power spectrum.

information number bound N is deduced. In other words, this is the information
contained within a given finite region of space that includes a finite amount
of energy. Similarly, this can be thought as the maximum amount of information
required to perfectly describe a given physical system down to its quantum
level. If the energy and the region of space are finite then the number of
information N required in describing the physical system is also finite. In
this short letter two information number bounds are derived and compared for
two types of universe. First, a universe without a cosmological constant lamda
and second a universe with a cosmological constant lamda are investigated. This
is achieved with the derivation of two different relations that connect the
Hubble constant and cosmological constants to the number of information N. We
find that the number of information N involved in a the two universes are
identical or
  N1=N2, and that the total mass of the universe scales as the square root of
the information number N, containing an information number N of the order of
10E+122. Finally, we expressed Calogero quantization action as a function of
the number of information N. We also have found that in self gravitating
systems the number of information N in nats is the ratio of the total kinetic
to total thermal energy of the system.

combining the cosmological constant Lambda, Planck constant, the speed of light
c, and also the gravitational constant G. The corresponding masses are
2.0x10E-62 kg and 2.3E+54 kg respectively, and in general can be obtained with
the help of a generic dimensional analysis, or from an analysis where the
cosmological constant appears in a four dimensional space-time and as a result
of a higher dimensional reduction. In this paper our goal is to establish a
relation for both quantum and gravitational mass as function of the information
number bit N. For this reason, we first derive an expression for the
cosmological constant as a function of information bit, since both masses
depend on it, and then various resulting relations are explored, in relation to
information number of bits N. Fractional information bits imply no information
extraction is possible. We see, that the order of magnitude of the various
parameters as well as their ratios involve the large number 10E+122, that is
produced naturally from the fundamental parameters of modern cosmology.
Finally, we propose that in a complete quantum gravity theory the idea of
information the might have to be included, with the quantum bits of information
(q-bits) as one of its fundamental parameters, resulting thus to a more
complete understanding of the universe, its laws, and its evolution.

dimensional chain is commonly achieved via the simultaneous action of
nonlinearity and longitudinal asymmetry, both confined to a limited portion of
the chain termed wave diode. However, it is conceivable that, in the presence
of an external magnetic field, spatial asymmetry perpendicular to the direction
of propagation suffices to ensure rectification. This is the case of a
nonlinear ring-shaped lattice with different upper and lower halves (diode),
which is attached to two elastic chains (leads). The resulting device is mirror
symmetric with respect to the ring vertical axis, but mirror asymmetric with
respect to the chain direction. Wave propagation along the two diode paths can
be modeled for simplicity by a discrete Schr\""odinger equation with cubic
nonlinearities. Numerical simulations demonstrate that, thanks to the
Aharonov-Bohm effect, such a diode can be operated by tuning the magnetic flux
across the ring.

  Inhomogeneous Anisotropic Media","16 pages, 2 figure",,,,"physics.class-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Vector and scalar potential formulation is valid from quantum theory to
classical electromagnetics. The rapid development in quantum optics calls for
electromagnetic solutions that straddle quantum physics as well as classical
physics. The vector potential formulation is a good candidate to bridge these
two regimes. Hence, there is a need to generalize this formulation to
inhomogeneous media. A generalized gauge is suggested for solving
electromagnetic problems in inhomogenous media which can be extended to the
anistropic case. The advantages of the resulting equations are their absence of
low-frequency catastrophe. Hence, usual differential equation solvers can be
used to solve them over multi-scale and broad bandwidth. It is shown that the
interface boundary conditions from the resulting equations reduce to those of
classical Maxwell's equations. Also, classical Green's theorem can be extended
to such a formulation, resulting in similar extinction theorem, and surface
integral equation formulation for surface scatterers. The integral equations
also do not exhibit low-frequency catastrophe as well as frequency imbalance as
observed in the classical formulation using E-H fields. The matrix
representation of the integral equation for a PEC scatterer is given.

wave-particle duality for both material particles and field particles, such as
photons. In the case of particles, their \psi-wave function is interpreted as
the particle's field of inertia and hence this field is characterised by its
own field carriers, inertons. Inertons and photons are considered as
quasi-particles, excitations of the real space constructed in the form of a
tessel-lattice. The diffraction of photons is explained as the deflection of
photons from their path owing to transverse flows of inertons, which appear in
the substance under consideration at the decay of non-equilibrium phonons
produced by transient photons.
