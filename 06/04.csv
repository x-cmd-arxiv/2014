interferometers for measuring the diagonal elements of the gravity gradient

performance than previous space gravity missions due to a very low white noise
spectral behavior and a very high common mode rejection, with the ultimate

  theorems",,,,,"math.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Friedland's Lower Matching Conjecture asserts that if $G$ is a $d$--regular
bipartite graph on $v(G)=2n$ vertices, and $m_k(G)$ denotes the number of
matchings of size $k$, then $$m_k(G)\geq {n \choose
k}^2\left(\frac{d-p}{d}\right)^{n(d-p)}(dp)^{np},$$ where $p=\frac{k}{n}$. When
$p=1$, this conjecture reduces to a theorem of Schrijver which says that a
$d$--regular bipartite graph on $v(G)=2n$ vertices has at least
$$\left(\frac{(d-1)^{d-1}}{d^{d-2}}\right)^n$$ perfect matchings. L. Gurvits
proved an asymptotic version of the Lower Matching Conjecture, namely he proved
that $$\frac{\ln m_k(G)}{v(G)}\geq \frac{1}{2}\left(p\ln
\left(\frac{d}{p}\right)+(d-p)\ln \left(1-\frac{p}{d}\right)-2(1-p)\ln
(1-p)\right)+o_{v(G)}(1).$$
  In this paper, we prove the Lower Matching Conjecture. In fact, we will prove
a slightly stronger statement which gives an extra $c_p\sqrt{n}$ factor
compared to the conjecture if $p$ is separated away from $0$ and $1$, and is
tight up to a constant factor if $p$ is separated away from $1$. We will also
give a new proof of Gurvits's and Schrijver's theorems, and we extend these
theorems to $(a,b)$--biregular bipartite graphs.

a realistic manner. Here, we study this question within the framework of
Baym-Kadanoff theory, an approach where one locates the stationary point of a
total energy functional of the one-particle Green's function in order to find
the total ground-state energy as well as all one-particle properties such as
the density matrix, chemical potential, or the quasiparticle energy spectrum
and quasiparticle wave functions. For the case of the Klein functional, our
basic finding is that minimizing the length of the gradient of the total energy
functional over non-interacting Green's functions yields a set of
self-consistent equations for quasiparticles that is identical to those of the
Quasiparticle Self-Consistent GW (QSGW) [1] approach, thereby providing an a
priori justification for such an approach to electronic structure calculations.
In fact, this result is general, applies to any self-energy operator, and is
not restricted to any particular approximation, e.g. the GW approximation for
the self-energy. The approach also shows that, when working in the basis of
quasiparticle states, solving the diagonal part of the self-consistent Dyson
equation is of primary importance while the off-diagonals are of secondary
importance, a common observation in the electronic structure literature of
self-energy calculations. Finally, numerical tests and analytical arguments
show that when the Dyson equation produces multiple quasiparticle solutions
corresponding to a single non-interacting state, minimizing the length of the
gradient translates into choosing the solution with largest quasiparticle
weight.

suggest that the reddest, most obscured objects display a higher angular
clustering amplitude, and thus reside in higher-mass dark matter halos. This is
a direct contradiction to the prediction of the simplest
unification-by-orientation models of AGN and quasars. However, clustering
measurements depend strongly on the ""mask"" that removes low-quality data and
describes the sky and selection function. We find that applying a robust,
conservative mask to WISE-selected quasars yields a weaker but still
significant difference in the bias between obscured and unobscured quasars.
These findings are consistent with results from previous Spitzer surveys, and
removes any scale dependence of the bias. For obscured quasars with $\langle z
\rangle = 0.99$ we measure a bias of $b_q = 2.67 \pm 0.16$, corresponding to a
halo mass of $\log (M_h / M_{\odot} h^{-1}) = 13.3 \pm 0.1$, while for
unobscured sources with $\langle z \rangle = 1.04$ we find $b_q = 2.04 \pm
0.17$ with a halo mass $\log (M_h / M_{\odot} h^{-1} )= 12.8 \pm 0.1$. This
improved measurement indicates that WISE-selected obscured quasars reside in
halos only a few times more massive than the halos of their unobscured
counterparts, a reduction in the factor of $\sim$10 larger halo mass as has
been previously reported using WISE-selected samples. Additionally, an
abundance matching analysis yields lifetimes for both obscured and unobscured
quasar phases on the order of a few 100 Myr ($\sim$ 1\% of the Hubble time) ---
however, the obscured phase lasts roughly twice as long, in tension with many
model predictions.

most massive members and binary heating. All are eventually disrupted tidally,
either by passing molecular clouds or the gravitational potential of their host
galaxies. However, their interior evolution can follow two very different
paths. Only clusters of sufficiently large initial population and size undergo
the combined interior contraction and exterior expansion that leads eventually
to core collapse. In all other systems, core collapse is frustrated by binary
heating. These clusters globally expand for their entire lives, up to the point
of tidal disruption.
  Using a suite of direct N-body calculations, we trace the ""collapse line"" in
r_v-N space that separates these two paths. Here, r_v and N are the cluster's
initial virial radius and population, respectively. For realistic starting
radii, the dividing N-value is from 10^4 to over 10^5. We also show that there
exists a minimum population, N_min, for core collapse. Clusters with N < N_min
tidally disrupt before core collapse occurs. At the Sun's Galactocentric
radius, R_G = 8.5 kpc, we find N_min >~ 300. The minimum population scales with
Galactocentric radius as R_G^{-9/8}.
  The position of an observed cluster relative to the collapse line can be used
to predict its future evolution. Using a small sample of open clusters, we find
that most lie below the collapse line, and thus will never undergo core
collapse. Most globular clusters, on the other hand, lie well above the line.
In such a case, the cluster may or may not go through core collapse, depending
on its initial size. We show how an accurate age determination can help settle
this issue.

statistics (LSS) of three important multi-spiked Hermitian random matrix
ensembles. The first is the most common spiked scenario, proposed by Johnstone,
which is a central Wishart ensemble with fixed-rank perturbation of the
identity matrix, the second is a non-central Wishart ensemble with fixed-rank
noncentrality parameter, and the third is a similarly defined non-central $F$
ensemble. These CLT results generalize our recent work to account for multiple
spikes, which is the most common scenario met in practice. The generalization
is non-trivial, as it now requires dealing with hypergeometric functions of
matrix arguments. To facilitate our analysis, for a broad class of such
functions, we first generalize a recent result of Onatski to present new
contour integral representations, which are particularly suitable for computing
large-dimensional properties of spiked matrix ensembles. Armed with such
representations, our CLT formulas are derived for each of the three spiked
models of interest by employing the Coulomb fluid method from random matrix
theory along with saddlepoint techniques. We find that for each matrix model,
and for general LSS, the individual spikes contribute additively to yield a
$O(1)$ correction term to the asymptotic mean of the linear statistic, which we
specify explicitly, whilst having no effect on the leading order terms of the
mean or variance.

multivariate time series and are formulated in the time domain as difference

desirable to work with a stable, or at least stationary, representation. To fit
such models, one must impose restrictions on the coefficient matrices to ensure
that certain determinants are nonzero; which, except in special cases, may
prove burdensome. To circumvent these difficulties, we propose a flexible
frequency domain model expressed in terms of the spectral density matrix.
Specifically, this paper treats the modeling of covariance stationary
vector-valued (i.e., multivariate) time series via an extension of the
exponential model for the spectrum of a scalar time series. We discuss the
modeling advantages of the vector exponential model and its computational
facets, such as how to obtain Wold coefficients from given cepstral

As in several previous models, the electrons are accelerated by turbulent fast
magnetosonic waves (""fast waves"") via transit-time-damping (TTD) interactions.
(In TTD interactions, fast waves act like moving magnetic mirrors that push the
electrons parallel or anti-parallel to the magnetic field). We also include the
effects of Coulomb collisions and the waves' parallel electric fields. Unlike
previous models, our model is two-dimensional in both momentum space and
wavenumber space and takes into account the anisotropy of the wave power
spectrum $F_k$ and electron distribution function $f_{\rm e}$. We use weak
turbulence theory and quasilinear theory to obtain a set of equations that
describes the coupled evolution of $F_k$ and $f_{\rm e}$. We solve these
equations numerically and find that the electron distribution function develops
a power-law-like non-thermal tail within a restricted range of energies $E\in
(E_{\rm nt}, E_{\rm max})$. We obtain approximate analytic expressions for
$E_{\rm nt}$ and $E_{\rm max}$, which describe how these minimum and maximum
energies depend upon parameters such as the electron number density and the
rate at which fast-wave energy is injected into the acceleration region at
large scales. We contrast our results with previous studies that assume that
$F_k$ and $f_{\rm e}$ are isotropic, and we compare one of our numerical
calculations with the time-dependent hard-x-ray spectrum observed during the
June 27, 1980 flare. In our numerical calculations, the electron energy spectra
are softer (steeper) than in models with isotropic $F_k$ and $f_{\rm e}$ and
closer to the values inferred from observations of solar flares.

exponents are defined for singular values of the product matrix that represents
a linear time evolution. Surprisingly a similar construction for the moduli of
the complex eigenvalues yields the very same exponents and normal distributions
to leading order. We discuss a general mechanism for $2\times 2$ matrices why
the singular values and the radii of complex eigenvalues collapse onto the same
value in the large-$t$ limit. Thereby we rederive Newman's triangular law which
has a simple interpretation as the radial density of complex eigenvalues in the

constraining physical properties of the proto-body, especially the initial spin
period and cohesive strength, as a function of the body's estimated size and
density. The breakup conditions are developed by combining mutual orbit
dynamics of the smaller components and the failure condition of the proto-body.
Given a proto-body with a bulk density ranging from 1000 kg/m3 to 1500 kg/m3 (a
typical range of the bulk density of C-type asteroids), we obtain possible
values of the cohesive strength (40 - 210 Pa) and the initial spin state (0.48
- 1.9 hr). From this result, we conclude that although the proto-body could
have been a rubble pile, it was likely spinning beyond its gravitational
binding limit and would have needed cohesive strength to hold itself together.
Additional observations of P/2013 R3 will enable stronger constraints on this
event, and the present technique will be able to give more precise estimates of

  latent variable model",,,,,"math.ST stat.ME stat.TH","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The analysis of high dimensional survival data is challenging, primarily due
to the problem of overfitting which occurs when spurious relationships are
inferred from data that subsequently fail to exist in test data. Here we
propose a novel method of extracting a low dimensional representation of
covariates in survival data by combining the popular Gaussian Process Latent
Variable Model (GPLVM) with a Weibull Proportional Hazards Model (WPHM). The
combined model offers a flexible non-linear probabilistic method of detecting
and extracting any intrinsic low dimensional structure from high dimensional
data. By reducing the covariate dimension we aim to diminish the risk of
overfitting and increase the robustness and accuracy with which we infer
relationships between covariates and survival outcomes. In addition, we can
simultaneously combine information from multiple data sources by expressing
multiple datasets in terms of the same low dimensional space. We present
results from several simulation studies that illustrate a reduction in
overfitting and an increase in predictive performance, as well as successful
detection of intrinsic dimensionality. We provide evidence that it is
advantageous to combine dimensionality reduction with survival outcomes rather
than performing unsupervised dimensionality reduction on its own. Finally, we
use our model to analyse experimental gene expression data and detect and
extract a low dimensional representation that allows us to distinguish high and

constant and Poisson's ratio of a multi-compound layer is calculated from
Vegard's law. Layers are strained in in-plane direction causing additional
strain in out-of-plane direction and may be only partially strained. For
crystals, wavelength-dependent electric susceptibility is represented as
Fourier series, components of which are calculated from atomic scattering
factors, H\""onl anomalous dispersion correction terms and Debye-Waller factor.
XRD intensity from heterostructures as a function of angle is calculated with
dynamical diffraction theory using Takagi-Taupin differential equation solution
in form of recursive equations. XRD measurements are analyzed by fitting a
simulated XRD curve to the measured XRD curve. Inverse problem related to curve
fitting is solved with differential evolution where principal component
analysis is used to reduce interparameter dependencies. For measurement
analysis a software was written with Java/Matlab, user interface (UI) of which
was designed by taking into account feedback from users. With UI, it is really
easy to build a layer model, parameters of which are obtained by fitting a
simulation to measurement. Software is also able to use GNU Octave and
therefore works without requiring any commercial components. Operability of
simulation code of XRD curves was tested by comparing the curves simulated by
it with curves simulated by 2 other software using single/multilayer InGaAs,
GaAs and GaAsN structures. Software was tested by analyzing a measurement
series having been published previously. Software was observed to produce
results similar to other software and the fitting algorithm was observed to
work efficiently.

periods of 48 and 120 days using likelihood periodograms and a Bayesian

archival ASAS-3 photometry show evidence for low-level activity periodicities
of the order of several hundred days. However, there are no significant
correlations with the radial velocity variations on the same time-scales. The
inclusion of planetary Keplerian signals in the model results in levels of
correlated and excess white noise that are remarkably low compared to younger
G, K and M dwarfs. We conclude that Kapteyn's star is most probably orbited by
two super-Earth mass planets, one of which is orbiting in its circumstellar
habitable zone, becoming the oldest potentially habitable planet known to date.
The presence and long-term survival of a planetary system seems a remarkable
feat given the peculiar origin and kinematic history of Kapteyn's star. The

application is the existence of the local move property for an infinite family

regions with respect to the local moves that interchange a tiling of an n x n
square by n/2 vertical rectangles, with a tiling by n/2 horizontal rectangles,

axes between 1.8 and 2 AU, low eccentricities and inclinations of 16-35
degrees. Small asteroids in the Hungaria region are dominated by a collisional
family associated with (434) Hungaria. The dominant spectral type of the
Hungaria group is the E or X-type (Warner et al, 2009), mostly due to the
E-type composition of Hungaria and its genetic family. It is widely believed
the E-type asteroids are related to the aubrite meteorites, also known as
enstatite achondrites (Gaffey et al, 1992). Here we explore the hypothesis that
aubrites originate in the Hungaria family. In order to test this connection, we
compare model Cosmic Ray Exposure ages from orbital integrations of model
meteoroids with those of aubrites. We show that long CRE ages of aubrites
(longest among stony meteorite groups) reflect the delivery route of meteoroids
from Hungarias to Earth being different than those from main-belt asteroids. We
find that the meteoroids from Hungarias predominantly reach Earth by
Yarkovsky-drifting across the orbit of Mars, with no assistance from orbital
resonances. We conclude that the CRE ages of aubrites are fully consistent with
a dominant source at the inner boundary of the Hungaria family at 1.7 AU. From
here, meteoroids reach Earth through the Mars-crossing region, with relatively
quick delivery times favored due to collisions (with Hungarias and the inner
main-belt objects). We find that, after Vesta, (434) Hungaria is the best
candidate for an asteroidal source of an achondrite group.

in particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations with non-zero guide fields so that
electrons remain magnetized. In this regime electric fields parallel to B
accelerate particles directly while those perpendicular to B do so through
gradient-B and curvature drifts. The curvature drift drives parallel heating
through Fermi reflection while the gradient B drift changes the perpendicular
energy through betatron acceleration. We present simulations in which we
evaluate each of these mechanisms in space and time in order to quantify their
role in electron heating. For a case with a small guide field (20 % of the
magnitude of the reconnecting component) the curvature drift is the dominant
source of electron heating. However, for a larger guide field (equal to the
magnitude of the reconnecting component) electron acceleration by the curvature
drift is comparable to that of the parallel electric field. In both cases the
heating by the gradient B drift is negligible in magnitude. Heating by the
curvature-drift dominates in the outflow exhausts where bent field lines expand
to relax their tension and is therefore distributed over a large area. In
contrast, the parallel electric field is localized near X-lines. Acceleration
by parallel electric fields may play a smaller role in large systems where the
X-line occupies a vanishing fraction of the system. The curvature drift and the
parallel electric field dominate the dynamics and drive parallel heating. A
consequence is that the electron energy spectrum becomes extremely anisotropic
at late time, which has important implications for quantifying the limits of
electron acceleration due to synchrotron emission. An upper limit on electron
energy gain that is substantially higher than earlier estimates is obtained by
balancing reconnection drive with radiative loss.

gravitational interaction of planets in this orbital architecture, with the
goal to develop methods that can be used to recognize this case in
observational data. In particular, we use a semi-analytic model to derive
parametric constraints that should facilitate data analysis. We show that
characteristic traits of the transit timing variations can directly constrain
the (i) ratio of planetary masses, and (ii) their total mass (divided by that
of the central star) as a function of the minimum angular separation as seen
from the star. In an ideal case, when transits of both planets are observed and
well characterized, the minimum angular separation can also be inferred from
the data. As a result, parameters derived from the observed transit timing
series alone can directly provide both planetary masses scaled to the central
star mass.

rather complex, with two-phase mesoscopic plate-shaped features aligned along
{113} habit planes. The minority phase are strongly facetted on the {113}

introduced as a result of the phase transformation. Annealing at 488K results
in coarsening of the mesoscopic plate-shaped features and the formation of a
third distinct phase. The subtle differences in structure and chemistry of the
minority phase(s) in the crystals are thought to be responsible for changes in
the superconducting transition temperature. In addition, scanning photoemission
microscopy has clearly shown that the electronic structure of the minority
phase has a higher occupied density of states of the low binding energy Fe3d
orbitals, characteristic of crystals that exhibit superconductivity. This
demonstrates a clear correlation between the Fe-vacancy-free phase with high

potential well, characterized by a high SFE; and (2) a late slow halo accretion
phase where, perhaps as a consequence of reionization, the SFE is low. Nearby
dwarfs have more old stars than predicted by assuming a constant or decreasing
SFE with redshift, a behavior that appears to deviate qualitatively from the
trends seen amongst more massive systems. Taken at face value, the data suggest
that, at sufficiently early epochs, dwarf galaxy halos above the atomic cooling

their non-perturbative nature: they hold even if the N-point function is deep
in the nonlinear regime, and even if they involve astrophysically messy galaxy
observables. The non-perturbative nature of the consistency relations is
guaranteed by the fact that they are symmetry statements, in which the velocity
plays the role of the soft pion. In this paper, we address two issues: (1) how
to derive the relations systematically using the residual coordinate freedom in
the Newtonian gauge, and relate them to known results in $\zeta$-gauge (often
used in studies of inflation); (2) under what conditions the consistency
relations are violated. In the non-relativistic limit, our derivation
reproduces the Newtonian consistency relation discovered by Kehagias \& Riotto
and Peloso & Pietroni. More generally, there is an infinite set of consistency
relations, as is known in $\zeta$-gauge. There is a one-to-one correspondence
between symmetries in the two gauges; in particular, the Newtonian consistency
relation follows from the dilation and special conformal symmetries in
$\zeta$-gauge. We probe the robustness of the consistency relations by studying
models of galaxy dynamics and biasing. We give a systematic list of conditions
under which the consistency relations are violated; violations occur if the
galaxy bias is non-local in an infrared divergent way. We emphasize the
relevance of the adiabatic mode condition, as distinct from symmetry

a binary population with an initial binary fraction of unity and an initial
excess of intermediate/wide separation (100 - 10$^4$ au) binaries does not
reproduce the observed properties in the field, even in initially dense ($\sim
10^3$M$_\odot$ pc$^{-3}$) star-forming regions.
  If instead we adopt a field-like population as the initial conditions, most
brown dwarf and M-dwarf binaries are dynamically hard and their overall
fractions and separation distributions are unaffected by dynamical evolution.
G-dwarf and A-star binaries in the field are dynamically intermediate in our
simulated dense regions and dynamical processing does destroy some systems with
separations $>$100 au. However, the formation of wide binaries through the
dissolution of supervirial regions is a strong function of primary mass, and
the wide G-dwarf and A-star binaries that are destroyed by dynamical evolution
in subvirial regions are replenished by the formation of binaries in
supervirial regions. We therefore suggest that the binary population in the

has a true large intrinsic variation or the option that the errors in the
determination are larger than anticipated. A correlation of the IMF with other
properties would help to make this distinction, but no strong correlation has
been found yet. The strongest correlation is with velocity dispersion. However,
it has a large scatter and the correlation depends on sample selection and
distance measurements. The correlation with velocity dispersion could be partly
caused by the colour-dependent calibration of the surface brightness
fluctuation distances of Tonry et al. (2001). We find that the K-band
luminosity limited ATLAS3D Survey is incomplete for the highest M/L galaxies
below 10^10.3 M_sun. There is a significant IMF - velocity dispersion trend for
galaxies with SED masses above this limit, but no trend for galaxies with
kinematic masses above this limit. We also find an IMF trend with distance, but
no correlation between nearest neighbour ETGs, which excludes a large
environmental dependence. Our findings do not rule out the reported IMF
variations, but they suggest that further study is needed.

estimate of the maximum gas accretion rate of 0.28 solar masses per year, about
five times lower than the average SFR of the sample. Given the assumptions, our

dramatically improved over past few decades due to increasingly exquisite
measurements made by Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) experiments. Recent data
from Planck matches well with the minimal $\Lambda$CDM model. A likelihood
analysis using Planck, WMAP and a selection of high resolution experiments
(highL), tensor to scalar ratio $r_{0.002}$ is found to be $<0.11$ when
$dn_{s}/d\ln k = 0$. Planck also imposes an upper bound on neutrino mass $\sum
m_\nu<0.23\,$eV using Planck+WMAP+highL+BAO likelihood. However, recently
results from BICEP 2 claims the detection of $r= 0.2^{+0.07}_{-0.05}$ from
polarization spectra. Further, results from SDSS-III BOSS large scale galaxy
survey constrains the total neutrino mass to $\sum m_\nu=0.36 \pm 0.10$ eV. It
is important to study the consequences of these new measurements on other
cosmological parameters. In this paper we assess the revised constraints on
cosmological parameters in light of these two measurements that are in some
tension with the constraints from Planck. Using the prior on $\sum m_\nu$ as
measured by SDSS-III BOSS and BICEP 2 likelihood, we find that the model with
running spectral index ($dn_{s}/d\ln k \neq 0$) leads to a value of $A_L>1$ at
$3.1 \sigma$. But, the model with $dn_{s}/d\ln k =0$ makes $A_L$ consistent
with $1$, at $2.1\sigma$ and also shows that $N_{\rm eff}$ is consistent with
its theoretical value of $3.046$ at around $2\sigma$. Therefore, the analysis
in this paper shows that the model with $dn_{s}/d\ln k =0$ gives consistency
with other cosmological parameters ($N_{\rm eff}$ and $A_L$ ) when the current
limits on $\sum m_\nu$ and $r_{0.05}$ are considered. However, on reducing the
value of $r_{0.05}$, the model with non-zero $dn_{s}/d\ln k$ gives consistent
result of $A_L =1$ [abridged].

become important and generate larger amplitude variability in the mid-infrared.
We also present models in which we perturb the temperature structure at
different pressure levels of the atmosphere to simulate hot spots. These models
show the most variability in the absorption features between spectral windows.
The variability is strongest at wavelengths that probe pressure levels at which
the heating is the strongest. The most illustrative types of observations for
understanding the physical processes underlying brown dwarf variability are
simultaneous, multi-wavelength observations that probe both inside and outside

soft spectra. Despite a large body of observational evidence for time lags, no
fundamental physical explanation for the origin of this phenomenon has been
presented. We develop a new theoretical model for the production of X-ray time
lags based on an exact analytical solution for the Fourier transform describing
the diffusion and Comptonization of seed photons propagating through a

undercomplete independent component analysis, linear regression, distance
metric learning, and more. This optimization framework gives insight to some
rarely discussed shortcomings of well-known methods, such as the suboptimality
of certain eigenvector solutions. Modern techniques for optimization over
matrix manifolds enable a generic linear dimensionality reduction solver, which
accepts as input data and an objective to be optimized, and returns, as output,
an optimal low-dimensional projection of the data. This simple optimization
framework further allows straightforward generalizations and novel variants of
classical methods, which we demonstrate here by creating an
orthogonal-projection canonical correlations analysis. More broadly, this
survey and generic solver suggest that linear dimensionality reduction can move
toward becoming a blackbox, objective-agnostic numerical technology.

deviations from a pure blackbody. The accurate physical interpretation of these
spectral features bears profound implications for our understanding of the
atmospheric composition, magnetic field strength and topology, and equation of
state of dense matter. With specific details varying from source to source,
common explanations for the features have ranged from atomic transitions in the
magnetized atmospheres or condensed surface, to cyclotron lines generated in a
hot ionized layer near the surface. Here we quantitatively evaluate the X-ray
spectral distortions induced by inhomogeneous temperature distributions of the
neutron star surface. To this aim, we explore several surface temperature
distributions, we simulate their corresponding general relativistic X-ray
spectra (assuming an isotropic, blackbody emission), and fit the latter with a
single blackbody model. We find that, in some cases, the presence of a spurious
'spectral line' is required at a high significance level in order to obtain
statistically acceptable fits, with central energy and equivalent width similar
to the values typically observed. We also perform a fit to a specific object,
RX J0806.4-4123, finding several surface temperature distributions able to
model the observed spectrum. The explored effect is unlikely to work in all
sources with detected lines, but in some cases it can indeed be responsible for
the appearance of such lines. Our results enforce the idea that surface
temperature anisotropy can be an important factor that should be considered and
explored also in combination with more sophisticated emission models like
atmospheres.

the minimum number of elements needed to express every other element under the
closure of the operation. In the case of groups, the previous best algorithm
for computing rank used polylogarithmic space. We reduce the best upper bounds
on the complexity of computing rank for groups and for quasigroups. This paper
proves that the rank problem for these algebraic structures can be verified by
highly restricted models of computation given only very short certificates of
correctness.
  Specifically, we prove that the problem of deciding whether the rank of a
finite quasigroup, given as a Cayley table, is smaller than a specified number
is decidable by a circuit of depth $O(\log \log n)$ augmented with $O(\log^2
n)$ nondeterministic bits. Furthermore, if the quasigroup is a group, then the
problem is also decidable by a Turing machine using $O(\log n)$ space and
$O(\log^2 n)$ bits of nondeterminism with the ability to read the
nondeterministic bits multiple times. Finally, we provide similar results for
related problems on other algebraic structures and other kinds of rank. These
new upper bounds are significant improvements, especially for groups. In
general, the lens of limited nondeterminism provides an easy way to improve
many simple algorithms, like the ones presented here, and we suspect it will be
especially useful for other algebraic algorithms.

revealing different properties when compared to planets orbiting solar-type
stars. In particular, they are Super-Jupiters and are not found orbiting
interior to $\sim$ 0.5 AU. Aims: We are conducting a radial velocity study of a
sample of 166 giant stars aimed at studying the population of close-in planets
orbiting giant stars and how their orbital and physical properties are
influenced by the post-MS evolution of the host star. Methods: We have
collected multi epochs spectra for all of the targets in our sample. We have
computed precision radial velocities from FECH/CHIRON and FEROS spectra, using
the I$_2$ cell technique and the simultaneous calibration method, respectively.
Results: We present the discovery of a massive planet around the giant star
HIP105854. The best Keplerian fit to the data leads to an orbital distance of
0.81 $\pm$ 0.03 AU, an eccentricity of 0.02 $\pm$ 0.03 and a projected mass of
8.2 $\pm$ 0.2 \mjup. With the addition of this new planet discovery, we
performed a detailed analysis of the orbital properties and mass distribution
of the planets orbiting giant stars. We show that there is an overabundance of
planets around giant stars with $a \sim$ 0.5-0.9 AU, which might be attributed
to tidal decay. Additionally, these planets are significantly more massive than
those around MS and subgiant stars, suggesting that they grow via accretion
either from the stellar wind or by mass transfer from the host star. Finally,
we show that planets around evolved stars have lower orbital eccentricities
than those orbiting solar-type stars, which suggests that they are either
formed in different conditions or that their orbits are efficiently
circularized by interactions with the host star.

scenario. We have found that a non-conservative evolutionary model is a better
representation for the current observed properties of the system. The best
evolutionary model suggests that DQ Vel has an age of 7.40 x 10^{7} yr and is
currently in a low mass transfer rate (-9.8x10^{-9} Msun/yr) stage, after a
mass transfer burst episode. Comparing the evolutionary stages of DQ Vel and
V393 Sco we observed that the former is an older system with a lower mass
transfer rate. This might explain the differences observed in the physical
parameters of their accretion discs.

  (full version)",,,,,"cs.LO cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The recent outburst of context-dependent knowledge on the Semantic Web (SW)
has led to the realization of the importance of the quads in the SW community.
Quads, which extend a standard RDF triple, by adding a new parameter of the
`context' of an RDF triple, thus informs a reasoner to distinguish between the
knowledge in various contexts. Although this distinction separates the triples
in an RDF graph into various contexts, and allows the reasoning to be decoupled
across various contexts, bridge rules need to be provided for inter-operating
the knowledge across these contexts. We call a set of quads together with the
bridge rules, a quad-system. In this paper, we discuss the problem of query
answering over quad-systems with expressive forall-existential bridge rules. It
turns out the query answering over quad-systems is undecidable, in general. We
derive a decidable class of quad-systems, namely context-acyclic quad-systems,
for which query answering can be done using forward chaining. Tight bounds for
data and combined complexity of query entailment has been established for the
derived class.

frequency interference (RFI) has been installed in several radio stations in
the Auger Engineering Radio Array (AERA) experiment. AERA observes coherent
radio emission from extensive air showers induced by ultra-high-energy cosmic
rays to make a detailed study of the development of the electromagnetic part of
air showers. Radio signals provide complementary information to that obtained
from Auger surface detectors, which are predominantly sensitive to the particle
content of an air shower at the surface. The radio signals from air showers are
caused by the coherent emission due to geomagnetic and charge-excess processes.
These emissions can be observed in the frequency band between 10 - 100 MHz.
However, this frequency range is significantly contaminated by narrow-band RFI
and other human-made distortions. A FIR filter implemented in the FPGA logic
segment of the front-end electronics of a radio sensor significantly improves
the signal-to-noise ratio.
  In this paper we present first results of the efficiency of the adaptive LP
FIR filter, deployed in real AERA station on pampas, with a comparison to the
currently used IIR notch filter with constant coefficients. The laboratory
tests confirms the stability of the filter. Using constant LP coefficients the
suppression efficiency remains the same for hours, which corresponds to more
than $\bf 10^{12}$ clock cycles. We compared in real conditions several
variants of the LP FIR filter with various lengths and various coefficients
widths (due to fixed-point representations in the FPGA logic) with the aim to
minimize the power consumption for the radio station while keeping sufficient
accuracy for noise reduction.

telecommunication networks. In such optical fibers, the light is guided over
long distances by continuous total internal reflection which occurs at the
interface between the fiber core with a higher refractive index and the lower
index cladding. Although this mechanism ensures that no light escapes from the
waveguide, it gives rise to an evanescent field in the cladding. While this
field is protected from interacting with the environment in standard optical
fibers, it is routinely employed in air- or vacuum-clad fibers in order to
efficiently couple light fields to optical components or emitters using, e.g.,
tapered optical fiber couplers. Remarkably, the strong confinement imposed by
the latter can lead to significant coupling of the light's spin and orbital
angular momentum. Taking advantage of this effect, we demonstrate the
controlled directional spontaneous emission of light by quantum emitters into a
sub-wavelength-diameter waveguide. The effect is investigated in a paradigmatic
setting, comprising cesium atoms which are located in the vicinity of a
vacuum-clad silica nanofiber. We experimentally observe an asymmetry higher
than 10:1 in the emission rates into the counterpropagating fundamental guided
modes of the nanofiber. Moreover, we demonstrate that this asymmetry can be
tailored by state preparation and suitable excitation of the quantum emitters.
We expect our results to have important implications for research in
nanophotonics and quantum optics and for implementations of integrated optical
signal processing in the classical as well as in the quantum regime.

choreographed through workflow, process data to generate results. The
reproduction of results is often not straightforward as the computational
objects may not be made available or may have been updated since the results
were generated. For example, services are often updated to fix bugs or improve
algorithms. This paper addresses these problems in three ways. Firstly, it
introduces a new framework to clarify the range of meanings of

comparison of workflow provenance traces to determine whether an experiment has
been reproduced; the main innovation is that if this is not the case then the
specific point(s) of divergence are identified through graph analysis,
assisting any researcher wishing to understand those differences. One key
feature is support for user-defined, semantic data comparison operators.
Finally, the paper describes an implementation of \PDIFF that leverages the
power of the e-Science Central platform which enacts workflows in the cloud. As
well as automatically generating a provenance trace for consumption by \PDIFF,
the platform supports the storage and re-use of old versions of workflows, data

achieve reproduction and re-use.

quiescent, with low surface density and low viscosity. Numerical studies of the

embedded within an isothermal protoplanetary disk at the inviscid limit of the

The size of the circumplanetary disk is found to be roughly one-tenth of the
corresponding Hill radius, which is consistent with the orbital radii of
irregular satellites found for Uranus. The protoplanetary gas accretes onto the
circumplanetary disk vertically from high altitude and returns to the
protoplanetary disk again near the midplane. This implies an open system in
which the circumplanetary disk constantly exchanges angular momentum and

process for natural radioactivity of unstable nuclei. The experimental data of
nuclear double $\beta^{-}$-decay with two neutrinos are analyzed and a
systematic law to calculate the half-lives of this rare process is proposed. It
is the first analytical and simple formula for double $\beta$-decay half-lives
where the leading effect from both the Coulomb potential and nuclear structure
is included. The systematic law shows that the logarithms of the half-lives are
inversely proportional to the decay energies for the ground state transitions
between parent nuclei and daughter nuclei. The calculated half-lives are in
agreement with the experimental data of all known eleven nuclei with an average
factor of 3.06. The half-lives of other possible double $\beta$-decay
candidates with two neutrinos are predicted and these can be useful for future
experiments. The law, without introducing any extra adjustment, is also
generalized to the calculations of double $\beta $-decay half-lives from the
ground states of parent nuclei to the first $0^+$ excited states of daughter
nuclei and the calculated half-lives agree very well with the available data.
Some calculated half-lives are the first theoretical results of double $\beta

studied computationally by examining the detonation velocity near the limit to
propagation in a thin explosive layer. The explosive system studied is an ideal
gas with a single exothermic reaction governed by a pressure-dependent reaction
rate ($p^n$) with a pressure exponent of $n = 3$. A pressure-dependent reaction
rate, rather than the exponential dependence of reaction on temperature of
Arrhenius kinetics, is used so that the detonation wave is stable in the
homogeneous case and can be modelled with simple, analytical techniques, and
thus the effect of introducing heterogeneity can be clearly identified. The
two-dimensional slab of explosive is bounded by a layer of inert gas with the
same thermodynamic properties as the explosive. The heterogeneity is introduced
into the explosive via a large-amplitude, two-dimensional sinusoidal ripple in
density in the initialization of the simulation, while maintaining a constant
pressure. The computational simulations are initialized with a ZND solution for
the ideal CJ detonation, and the detonation is allowed to propagate into the
explosive layer. The simulations show that the detonation in the heterogeneous
media exhibits a cellular-like structure of complex shock interactions. The
detonation is able to propagate into a significantly thinner layer of explosive
and can exhibit a greater velocity than the corresponding homogeneous case. A
parametric study of varying the wavelength of the sinusoid shows the existence
of an optimal size of heterogeneity at which the favorable effect is the
greatest corresponding to a wavelength that is approximately 10 to 50 times the
half reaction zone length of the ideal CJ detonation. As the wavelength is
decreased to the size of the reaction zone length, the behavior reverts back to
the homogeneous case.

galaxies in which the star formation has been recently quenched due to the
feedback of the nuclear activity, as suggested by the presence of the
post-starburst population at the nucleus. We have found that the old stellar
population (age $\ge$ 2.5 Gyr) dominates the flux at 5100 \AA\ in the inner
0.26 kpc, while both the post-starburst (100 Myr $\le$ age $<$ 2.5 Gyr) and
starburst (age $<$ 100 Myr) components dominate the flux in a circumnuclear
ring at $\approx$0.5 kpc from the nucleus. With our spatially resolved study we
do not have found any post-starburst stellar population in the inner 0.26\,kpc.
On the other hand, we do see the signature of AGN feedback in this region,
which does not reach the circumnuclear ring where the post-starburst population
is observed. We thus do not support the quenching scenario for the J0330-0532.
In addition, we have concluded that the strong signature of the post-starburst
population in larger aperture spectra (e.g. from Sloan Digital Sky Survey) is
partially due to the combination of the young and old age components. Based on
the M$_{\rm BH}-\sigma_{\rm star}$ relationship and the stellar kinematics we
have estimated a mass for the supermassive black hole of 1.48 $\pm$ 0.66

found. For the most central collisions, a significant enhancement is observed
in the PbPb / pp fragmentation function ratio for charged particles with pt
less than 3 GeV. This enhancement is observed for all jet pt bins studied.

trial value that yields the same wavelength for a given line predicted to be
about as strong as that of a strong unidentified spectral line observed in the
stellar spectra, then checking the new wavelengths of other strong predicted
transitions that share the same upper level for coincidence with other strong
observed unidentified lines. To date this analysis has provided the upper
energies of 66 Fe I levels. Many new level energies are higher than those
accessible to laboratory experiments; several exceed the Fe I ionization
energy. These levels provide new identifications for over two thousand
potentially detectable lines. Almost all of the new levels of odd parity
include UV lines that were detected but unclassified in laboratory Fe I
absorption spectra, providing an external check on the energy values. We
motivate and present the procedure, provide the resulting new level energies

solutions as a result of modulational instability of the phonon states. These
breathers localize energy by freezing other parts of the chain. Eventually this
localised part of the chain grows in amplitude until it overcomes the critical
elongation characterized by the transition state. Doing so, the breathers
ignite an escape by pulling the remaining chain over the barrier. Even if the

processes of cosmic superstrings in two widely used effective models of D-brane
inflation, namely the $D3/D7$ and $D3/\bar{D}3$ models. Specifically, we show
that the strings produced in $D3/D7$ are of local axionic type and we place
constraints on the tension while arguing that the supersymmetry breaking
mechanism of the model needs to be altered according to supergravity
constraints on constant Fayet-Iliopoulos terms. Moreover, we study radiative
processes of cosmic superstrings on warped backgrounds. We argue that placing
the string formation in a natural context such as $D3/\bar{D}3$ inflation,
restricts the forms of possible radiation from these objects. Motivated by
these string models, which inevitably result in the presence of heavy moduli
fields during inflation, in the second part, using the Effective Field Theory
(EFT) of inflation, we construct operators that capture the effects of massive
scalars on the low energy dynamics of inflaton perturbations. We compute the
energy scales that define the validity window of the EFT such as the scale
where ultra violet (UV) degrees of freedom become operational and the scale
where the EFT becomes strongly coupled. We show that the low energy operators
related to heavy fields induce a dispersion relation for the light modes
admitting two regimes: a linear and a non linear/dispersive one. Assuming that

Boundary Metric (LBM) is proposed to replace $\chi^2$ difference adopted by the
classical algorithm mPb. Compared with $\chi^2$ difference, LBM is composed of
a single layer neural network and an RBF kernel, and is fine-tuned by
supervised learning rather than human-crafted. It is more effective in
describing the dissimilarity between natural image regions while tolerating
large variance of image data. After substituting $\chi^2$ difference with LBM,
the F-measure metric of mPb on the BSDS500 benchmark is increased from 0.69 to

techniques is to introduce a small dimensional snapshot space. We present
numerical results for two-phase flow and transport, without updating basis
functions in time. Our numerical results show that one can achieve good
accuracy with a few basis functions per coarse edge if one selects appropriate
offline spaces.

modern physics that accommodates equally well classical (interferences of
waves) and quantum (correlations between indistinguishable particles)
interpretations. The effect was discovered in the late thirties with a basic
observation of Hanbury Brown that radio-pulses from two distinct antennas
generate signals on the oscilloscope that wiggle similarly to the naked eye.
When Hanbury Brown and his mathematician colleague Twiss took the obvious step
to propose bringing the effect in the optical range, they met with considerable
opposition as single-photon interferences were deemed impossible. The Hanbury
Brown--Twiss effect is nowadays universally accepted and, being so fundamental,
embodies many subtleties of our understanding of the wave/particle dual nature
of light. Thanks to a novel experimental technique, we report here a
generalized version of the Hanbury Brown--Twiss effect to include the frequency
of the detected light, or, from the particle point of view, the energy of the
detected photons. In addition to the known tendencies of indistinguishable
photons to arrive together on the detector, we find that photons of different
colors present the opposite characteristic of avoiding each others. We
postulate that fermions can be similarly brought to exhibit positive
(boson-like) correlations by frequency filtering.

Secondly, we use the dynamical parameters that are mass $m$, energy $E_0$ and

It has been shown that these equations are very similar to the ones used to
model the free Rayleigh-Benard convection. The difference is that while in the
case of thermal convection the volume expansion is driven by the coefficient of
thermal expansion, the key role for the osmotic instability is played by the
coefficient of isothermal compressibility. In addition, it has been shown that
the osmotic process represents a propagation of standing waves with

processes subsequent to electronic excitation, which play a functional role in

treatment of relaxation in the context of 2D-spectroscopy is well-developed
under the assumption of different timescales of population transfer and
fluctuation dynamics, the interplay between both kinds of processes lacks a
comprehensive description in terms of line shape functions. To bridge this gap,
we use the cumulant expansion approach to derive response functions, which
account for fluctuation dynamics and population transfer simultaneously. We
compare 2D-spectra from calculations with different model assumptions about
correlations between fluctuations and point out under which conditions a
simplified treatment is justified. Our study shows that population transfer and
dissipative fluctuation dynamics cannot be described independent of each other
in general. Advantages and limitations of the proposed calculation method and
its compatibility with the modified Redfield description are discussed.

objects (YSOs) and estimate their age and mass. Our spectroscopic results
indicate that the majority of the X-ray sources are late spectral type stars.
The region shows a large amount of differential reddening with minimum and
maximum values of $E(B-V)$ as 0.25 and 1.1 mag, respectively. Our analysis
reveals that the total-to-selective absorption ratio $R \rm_{V}$ is $\sim$3.7
$\pm$ 0.1, suggesting an abnormal grain size in the observed region. We
identified 467 YSOs and studied their characteristics. The ages and masses of
the 241 optically identified YSOs range from $\sim$0.1 to 10 Myr and $\sim$0.3
to 4.8M$_\odot$, respectively. However, the majority of them are younger than 1
Myr and have masses below 2 M$_\odot$. The high mass star WR 22 does not seem
to have contributed to the formation of YSOs in the CrW region. The initial
mass function slope, $\Gamma$, in this region is found to be -1.13 $\pm$ 0.20
in the mass range of 0.5 < M/M$_\odot$ < 4.8. The $K$-band luminosity function
slope ($\alpha$) is also estimated as 0.31 $\pm$ 0.01. We also performed
minimum spanning tree analysis of the YSOs in this region, which reveals that
there are at least ten YSO cores associated with the molecular cloud, and that
leads to an average core radius of 0.43 pc and a median branch length of 0.28
pc.

a fair unbiased sample when considering spheres of about $60\,h^{-1}\,{\rm

found a reasonable agreement with the estimates of Karachentsev (2012) only
when considering the contribution of dark haloes. This indicates that
observational estimates may be biased towards low density values. As a first
application of our reconstruction, we investigate the likelihood of different
galaxy morphological types to inhabit certain cosmic web environments. In
particular, we find that, irrespective of the method used to define the web,
either based on the density or the peculiar velocity field, elliptical galaxies
show a clear tendency to preferentially reside in clusters as opposed to voids
(up to a level of $5.3\sigma$ and $9.8\sigma$ respectively) and conversely for
spiral galaxies (up to a level of $5.6\sigma$ and $5.4\sigma$ respectively).

in general requires complex numbers to be formulated. However, it soon turned
out to even require some hypercomplex algebra. Incorporating Special Relativity
leads to an equation (Dirac 1928) requiring pairwise anti-commuting
coefficients, usually $4\times 4$ matrices. A unitary ring of square matrices
is an associative hypercomplex algebra by definition. Since only the algebraic
properties and relations of the elements matter, we replace the matrices by
biquaternions. In this paper, we first consider the basics of non-relativistic
and relativistic QT. Then we introduce general hypercomplex algebras and also
show how a relativistic quantum equation like Dirac's one can be formulated
using biquaternions. Subsequently, some algebraic preconditions for operations
within hypercomplex algebras and their subalgebras will be examined. For our
purpose equations akin to Schr\""odinger's should be able to be set up and
solved. Functions of complementary variables should be Fourier transforms of
each other. This should hold within a purely non-real subspace which must hence
be a subalgebra. Furthermore, it is an ideal denoted by $\mathcal{J}$. It must
be isomorphic to $\mathbb{C}$, hence containing an internal identity element.
The bicomplex numbers will turn out to fulfil these preconditions, and
therefore, the formalism of QT can be developed within its subalgebras. We also
show that bicomplex numbers encourage the definition of several different kinds
of conjugates. One of these treats the elements of $\mathcal{J}$ like the usual
conjugate treats complex numbers. This defines a quantity what we call a
modulus which, in contrast to the complex absolute square, remains non-real
(but may be called `pseudo-real'). However, we do not conduct an explicit

class of the transition, both for the statics and the dynamics. We show that
the proper dynamical order parameter is in fact not the excitation density and
find evidence that the dynamical transition is in the ""model A"" universality

with non-conserved order parameter. This sheds light on some relevant and
observable aspects of dynamical transitions in Rydberg gases. In particular, it
permits a quantitative understanding of a recent experiment [C. Carr et al.,

as power-law scaling of the relaxation time. The latter emerges not due to
critical slowing down in the vicinity of a second order transition, but from
the non-equilibrium dynamics near a so-called spinodal line.

repeats that are longer than the reads. This is particularly true for RNA- seq
data, since coverage information cannot be used to flag repeated sequences, of
which transposable elements are one of the main examples. Most transcriptome
assemblers are based on de Bruijn graphs and have no clear and explicit model
for repeats in RNA-seq data, relying instead on heuristics to deal with them.
The results of this work are twofold. First, we introduce a formal model for
repre- senting high copy number repeats in RNA-seq data and exploit its
properties for inferring a combinatorial characteristic of repeat-associated
subgraphs. We show that the problem of identifying in a de Bruijn graph a
subgraph with this charac- teristic is NP-complete. In a second step, we show
that in the specific case of a local assembly of alternative splicing (AS)
events, we can implicitly avoid such subgraphs. In particular, we designed and
implemented an algorithm to efficiently identify AS events that are not
included in repeated regions. Finally, we validate our results using synthetic
data. We also give an indication of the usefulness of our method on real data.

Dempster in 1974 for significance testing in the simple vs composite hypotheses
case. In this hypotheses test case, classical frequentist and Bayesian
hypotheses tests are irreconcilable, as emphasized by Lindley's paradox, Berger
& Selke in 1987 and many others. However, Dempster shows that the PLR (with
inner threshold 1) is equal to the frequentist p-value in the simple Gaussian
case. In 1997, Aitkin extends this result by adding a nuisance parameter and
showing its asymptotic validity under more general distributions. Here we
extend the reconciliation between the PLR and a frequentist p-value for a
finite sample, through a framework analogous to the Stein's theorem frame in
which a credible (Bayesian) domain is equal to a confidence (frequentist)
domain.
  This general reconciliation result only concerns simple vs composite
hypotheses testing. The measures proposed by Aitkin in 2010 and Evans in 1997
have interesting properties and extend Dempster's PLR but only by adding a
nuisance parameter. Here we propose two extensions of the PLR concept to the
general composite vs composite hypotheses test. The first extension can be
defined for improper priors as soon as the posterior is proper. The second
extension appears from a new Bayesian-type Neyman-Pearson lemma and emphasizes,
from a Bayesian perspective, the role of the LR as a discrepancy variable for
hypothesis testing.

and hot delta Scuti star showing regular groups of pulsation frequencies. The
first asteroseismic models required lower than solar metallicity to fit the
observed frequency range based on a purely photometric analysis.
High-resolution, high S/N spectroscopic data obtained with the HARPS
spectrograph were used to determine the fundamental parameters and chemical
abundances of HD 144277. These values were put into context alongside the
results from asteroseismic models. The effective temperature, Teff, of HD
144277 was determined as 8640(+300)(-100) K, log g is 4.14 +/- 0.15 and the
projected rotational velocity, vsini, is 62.0 +/- 2.0 km/s. As the vsini value
is significantly larger than previously assumed, we refined the first
asteroseimic model accordingly. The overall metallicity Z was determined to be
0.011 where the light elements He, C, O, Na, and S show solar chemical
composition, but the heavier elements are significantly underabundant. In
addition, the radius of HD 144277 was determined to be 1.55 +/- 0.65 Rsun from
spectral energy distribution fitting, based on photometric data taken from the
literature. From the spectroscopic observations, we could confirm our previous
assumption from asteroseismic models that HD 144277 has less than solar
metallicity. The fundamental parameters derived from asteroseismology, Teff,
log g, L/Lsun and R\Rsun, agree within one sigma to the values found from
spectroscopic analysis. As the vsini value is significantly higher than assumed
in the first analysis, near-degeneracies and rotational mode coupling were
taken into account in the new models. These suggest that HD 144277 has an
equatorial rotational velocity of about 80 km/s and is seen equator-on. The
observed frequencies are identified as prograde modes.

dependent time series in a general framework of approximately linear
statistics. The following high dimensional applications are covered: (1)
uniform confidence band for mean vector; (2) specification testing on the
second order property of time series such as white noise testing and bandedness
testing of covariance matrix; (3) specification testing on the spectral
property of time series. In theory, we first derive a Gaussian approximation
result for the maximum of a sum of weakly dependent vectors, where the
dimension of the vectors is allowed to be exponentially larger than the sample
size. In particular, we illustrate an interesting interplay between dependence
and dimensionality, and also discuss one type of ""dimension free"" dependence
structure. We further propose a blockwise multiplier (wild) bootstrap that
works for time series with unknown autocovariance structure. These
distributional approximation errors, which are finite sample valid, decrease
polynomially in sample size. A non-overlapping block bootstrap is also studied
as a more flexible alternative. The above results are established under the
general physical/functional dependence framework proposed in Wu (2005). Our
work can be viewed as a substantive extension of Chernozhukov et al. (2013) to
time series based on a variant of Stein's method developed therein.

state-of-the-art phosphor converted ultra-bright white LEDs, used in a wide
range of medical imaging devices, which have a fixed spectrum and color
temperature at a given operating point. In particular, the system can more
easily be adapted to the requirements originating from different tissues in the
human body which have wavelength dependent absorption and reflectivity. This
leads to improved contrast for different kinds of imaged tissue components. The
concept of such a lighting architecture can be vastly utilized in many other

reservoirs or hydrocarbon extraction from reservoir rocks usually involves
behaviours at two scales: lower scale of the inelastic localization zone, and
larger scale of the bulk continuum where elastic behaviour can be reasonably
assumed. The hydraulic conductivities corresponding to the mechanical
properties at these two scales are different. In the bulk elastic host rock,
the hydraulic conductivity does not vary much with the deformation, while it
significantly changes in the lower scale of the localization zone due to
inelastic deformation. Increase of permeability due to fracture and/or
dilation, or reduction of permeability due to material compaction can take
place inside this zone. The challenge is to predict the evolution of hydraulic
conductivities coupled with the mechanical behaviour of the material in all
stages of the deformation process. In the early stage of diffuse deformation,
the permeability of the material can be reasonably assumed to be homogenous
over the whole Representative Volume Element (RVE) However, localized failure
results in distinctly different conductivities in different parts of the RVE.
This paper establishes a general framework and corresponding field equations to
describe the hydro-mechanical coupling in both diffuse and localized stages of
deformation in rocks. In particular, embedding the lower scale hydro-mechanical
behaviour of the localization zone inside an elastic bulk, together with their
corresponding effective sizes, helps effectively deal with scaling issues in
large-scale modelling. Preliminary results are presented which demonstrate the
promising features of this new approach.

is a novel means to code the information packets, with the aim of minimizing
the energy consumed for coding operations. The performance of CDC is similar to
CNC in terms of the probability of successful reception at the destination and
expected number of correctly received information packets at the destination.
However, CDC requires less energy at the source node because of its
implementation simplicity. Achieving minimal energy consumption, with the
required level of reliability is critical for the optimum functioning of many
wireless sensor and body area networks. For representative applications, the
optimized CDC or CNC network achieves >= 25% energy savings compared to the

better than Y for simple value lookups due its flatter structure?, etc. In

illustrate CoCoE by its application to selected biomedical RDF datasets.

induced by a short laser pulse in a hybrid three-mode optomechanical system is
investigated. The calculation is carried out under the bad cavity limit, the
adiabatic approximation of a slowly varying amplitude of the cavity mode, and
with the assumption of driving the cavity mode with a blue detuned strong laser
pulse. Under such conditions, explicit expressions of the bipartite and
tripartite steering parameters are obtained, and the concept of collective
tripartite quantum steering, recently introduced by He and Reid [Phys. Rev.
Lett. 111, 250403 (2013)], is clearly explored. It is found that both bipartite
and tripartite steering parameters are sensitive functions of the initial state
of the modes and distinctly different steering behaviour could be observed
depending on whether the modes were initially in a thermal state or not. We
find that the initial thermal noise is more effective in destroying the
bipartite rather than the tripartite steering which, on the other hand, can
persist even for a large thermal noise. For the initial vacuum state of a
steered mode, the tripartite steering exists over the entire interaction time
even if the steering modes are in very noisy thermal states. When the steered
mode is initially in a thermal state, it can be collectively steered by the
other modes. There are thresholds for the average number of the thermal photons
above which the existing tripartite steering appears as the collective
steering. Finally, we point out that the collective steering may provide a
resource in a hybrid quantum network for quantum secret sharing protocol.

set) of possibilities. For objectifiable, comparable and precise information
the domain should be the same for all. Therefore the global (online) definition
of the domain is proposed here. It is advantageous to define an ordered domain,
because this allows using numbers for addressing the elements and because
nature is ordered in many respects. The original data can be ordered in
multiple independent ways. We can define a domain with multiple independent
numeric dimensions to reflect this. Because we want to search information in
the domain, for quantification of similarity we define a distance function or
metric. Therefore we propose ""Domain Spaces"" (DSs) which are online defined
nestable metric spaces. Their elements are called ""Domain Vectors"" (DVs) and
have the simple form:
  URL (of common DS definition) plus sequence of numbers
  At this the sequence must be given so that the mapping of numbers to the DS
dimensions is clear. By help of appropriate software DVs can be represented
e.g. as words and numbers. Compared to words, however, DVs have (as original
information) important objectifiable advantages (clear definition, objectivity,
information content, range, resolution, efficiency, searchability). Using DSs
users can define which information they make searchable and how it is
searchable. DSs can be also used to make quantitative (numeric) data as uniform
DVs interoperable, comparable and searchable. The approach is demonstrated in
an online database with search engine (http://NumericSearch.com). The search
procedure is called ""Numeric Search"". It consists of two systematic steps: 1.
Selection of the appropriate DS e.g. by conventional word based search within

The improvement is based on an exquisite angular resolution achieved by

simulating the quantum dynamics of condensed phase systems are centroid
molecular dynamics (CMD) and ring polymer molecular dynamics (RPMD). Despite
their conceptual differences, practical implementations of these methods differ
in just two respects: the choice of the Parrinello-Rahman mass matrix and
whether or not a thermostat is applied to the internal modes of the ring
polymer during the dynamics. Here we explore a method which is halfway between
the two approximations: we keep the path integral bead masses equal to the
physical particle masses but attach a Langevin thermostat to the internal modes
of the ring polymer during the dynamics. We justify this by showing
analytically that the inclusion of an internal mode thermostat does not affect
any of the desirable features of RPMD: thermostatted RPMD (TRPMD) is equally
valid with respect to everything that has actually been proven about the method
as RPMD itself. In particular, because of the choice of bead masses, the
resulting method is still optimum in the short-time limit, and the transition
state approximation to its reaction rate theory remains closely related to the
semiclassical instanton approximation in the deep quantum tunneling regime. In
effect, there is a continuous family of methods with these properties,
parameterised by the strength of the Langevin friction. Here we explore
numerically how the approximation to quantum dynamics depends on this friction,
with a particular emphasis on vibrational spectroscopy. We find that a broad
range of frictions approaching optimal damping give similar results, and that
these results are immune to both the resonance problem of RPMD and the
curvature problem of CMD.

substantially suppressed, essentially truncated by the collapsed tetragonal

of an arbitrary number of relays, where it is assumed that no direct link is
available at each S-D pair. The aim is to find the fundamental limit on the
maximal common multicast throughput of all source nodes if resource allocations
are available. A transmission protocol employing the relaying strategy, namely,
compute-and-forward (CPF), is proposed. {We also adjust the methods in the
literature to obtain the integer network-constructed coefficient matrix (a
naive method, a local optimal method as well as a global optimal method) to fit
for the general topology with an arbitrary number of relays. Two transmission
scenarios are addressed. The first scenario is delay-stringent transmission
where each message must be delivered within one slot. The second scenario is
delay-tolerant transmission where no delay constraint is imposed. The
associated optimization problems to maximize the short-term and long-term
common multicast throughput are formulated and solved, and the optimal
allocation of power and time slots are presented. Performance comparisons show
that the CPF strategy outperforms conventional decode-and-forward (DF)
strategy. It is also shown that with more relays, the CPF strategy performs
even better due to the increased diversity. Finally, by simulation, it is
observed that for a large network in relatively high SNR regime, CPF with the
local optimal method for the network-constructed matrix can perform close to
that with the global optimal method.

  As an application we consider the superselection structure of the quantum

  (TPAMI)",,,,"cs.LG cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Classifier ensemble generally should combine diverse component classifiers.
However, it is difficult to give a definitive connection between diversity
measure and ensemble accuracy. Given a list of available component classifiers,
how to adaptively and diversely ensemble classifiers becomes a big challenge in
the literature. In this paper, we argue that diversity, not direct diversity on
samples but adaptive diversity with data, is highly correlated to ensemble
accuracy, and we propose a novel technology for classifier ensemble, learning
to diversify, which learns to adaptively combine classifiers by considering
both accuracy and diversity. Specifically, our approach, Learning TO Diversify
via Weighted Kernels (L2DWK), performs classifier combination by optimizing a
direct but simple criterion: maximizing ensemble accuracy and adaptive
diversity simultaneously by minimizing a convex loss function. Given a measure
formulation, the diversity is calculated with weighted kernels (i.e., the
diversity is measured on the component classifiers' outputs which are kernelled
and weighted), and the kernel weights are automatically learned. We minimize
this loss function by estimating the kernel weights in conjunction with the
classifier weights, and propose a self-training algorithm for conducting this
convex optimization procedure iteratively. Extensive experiments on a variety
of 32 UCI classification benchmark datasets show that the proposed approach
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art ensembles such as Bagging, AdaBoost,
Random Forests, Gasen, Regularized Selective Ensemble, and Ensemble Pruning via
Semi-Definite Programming.

combine high-resolution UV and spectro-polarimetric observations of BPs by the
SUNRISE observatory with 3D radiation MHD simulations. Full spectral line
syntheses are performed with the MHD data and a careful degradation is applied
to take into account all relevant instrumental effects of the observations. It
is demonstrated that the MHD simulations reproduce the measured distributions
of intensity at multiple wavelengths, line-of-sight velocity, spectral line
width, and polarization degree rather well. Furthermore, the properties of
observed BPs are compared with synthetic ones. These match also relatively
well, except that the observations display a tail of large and strongly
polarized BPs not found in the simulations. The higher spatial resolution of
the simulations has a significant effect, leading to smaller and more numerous
BPs. The observation that most BPs are weakly polarized is explained mainly by
the spatial degradation, the stray light contamination, and the temperature
sensitivity of the Fe I line at 5250.2 \AA{}. The Stokes $V$ asymmetries of the
BPs increase with the distance to their center in both observations and
simulations, consistent with the classical picture of a production of the
asymmetry in the canopy. This is the first time that this has been found also
in the internetwork. Almost vertical kilo-Gauss fields are found for 98 % of
the synthetic BPs. At the continuum formation height, the simulated BPs are on
average 190 K hotter than the mean quiet Sun, their mean BP field strength is
1750 G, supporting the flux-tube paradigm to describe BPs.

repulsive. At large velocities the collision is independent of the initial
phase difference {\delta}. This is quasi-elastic and the result is two

in this area and proposed an active system, termed SAGED, whose objectives is
to manage link and consistency using active rules. However SAGED is based on an
