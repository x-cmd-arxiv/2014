cognitive radio systems, where both the secondary-to-primary and
primary-to-secondary channels have a Line-of-Sight (LoS) component. Based on a
Rician model for the LoS channels, we show, analytically and numerically, that
LoS interference hinders the achievable secondary user capacity when
interference constraints are imposed at the primary user receiver. This is
caused by the poor dynamic range of the interference channels fluctuations when
a dominant LoS component exists. In order to improve the capacity of such
system, we propose the usage of an Electronically Steerable Parasitic Array
Radiator (ESPAR) antennas at the secondary terminals. An ESPAR antenna involves
a single RF chain and has a reconfigurable radiation pattern that is controlled
by assigning arbitrary weights to M orthonormal basis radiation patterns via
altering a set of reactive loads. By viewing the orthonormal patterns as
multiple virtual dumb antennas, we randomly vary their weights over time
creating artificial channel fluctuations that can perfectly eliminate the
undesired impact of LoS interference. This scheme is termed as Random Aerial
Beamforming (RAB), and is well suited for compact and low cost mobile terminals
as it uses a single RF chain. Moreover, we investigate the exposed secondary
users problem in a multiuser setting, showing that LoS interference hinders
multiuser interference diversity and affects the growth rate of the SU capacity
as a function of the number of users. Using RAB, we show that LoS interference
can actually be exploited to improve multiuser diversity via opportunistic
nulling.

infrared measurements as a function of pressure indicate the closing and the
reopening of the band gap as well as a maximum in the free carrier spectral

coarsely quasi-isometric invariants of leaves in some residual saturated subset
when the foliated space is transitive. In fact, we also use ""equi-"" versions of
this kind of invariants, which means that the definition is satisfied with the
same constants by some given set of leaves. For instance, the following
properties are proved. Either all dense leaves without holonomy are
equi-coarsely quasi-isometric to each other, or else there exist residually
many dense leaves without holonomy such that each of them is coarsely
quasi-isometric to meagerly many leaves. Assuming that the foliated space is
minimal, the first of the above alternatives holds if and if the leaves without
holonomy satisfy a condition called coarse quasi-symmetry. A similar dichotomy
holds for the growth type of the leaves, as well as an analogous
characterization of the first alternative in the minimal case, involving a
property called growth symmetry. Moreover some classes of growth are shared,
either by residually many leaves, or by meagerly many leaves. If some leaf
without holonomy is amenable, then all dense leaves without holonomy are
equi-amenable, and, in the minimal case, they satisfy a property called
amenable symmetry. Residually many leaves have the same asymptotic dimension.
If the foliated space is minimal, then any pair of nonempty open sets in the
Higson coronas of the leaves with holonomy contain homeomorphic nonempty open
subsets. Another part studies limit sets of leaves at points in their Higson
corona, defined like the usual limit sets at their ends.

average spectrum. The 2.405 {\mu}m band on Pluto was detected at the
7.5-{\sigma} level from the grand average spectrum. Additionally, the band was
found to vary longitudinally with the highest absorption occurring in the
N$_2$-rich region and the lowest absorption occurring in the visibly dark
region. The longitudinal variability of $^{12}$CO does not match that of the
2.405 {\mu}m band, suggesting a minimal contribution to the band by $^{13}$CO.
We argue for ethane production in the atmosphere and present a theory of
volatile transport to explain the observed longitudinal trend.

back to 1958, when R\'enyi studied the following random process: Consider an
interval $I$ of length $x$, and sequentially and randomly pack disjoint unit
intervals in $I$ until the remaining space prevents placing any new segment.
The expected value of the measure of the covered part of $I$ is $M(x)$, so that
the ratio $M(x)/x$ is the expected filling density of the random process.
Following recent work by Gargano {\it et al.} \cite{GWML(2005)}, we studied the
discretized version of the above process by considering the packing of the $1D$
discrete lattice interval $\{1,2,...,n+2k-1\}$ with disjoint blocks of $(k+1)$
integers but, as opposed to the mentioned \cite{GWML(2005)} result, our
exclusion process is symmetric, hence more natural. Furthermore, we were able
to obtain useful recursion formulas for the expected number of $r$-gaps ($0\le
r\le k$) between neighboring blocks. We also provided very fast converging
series and extensive computer simulations for these expected numbers, so that
the limiting filling density of the long line segment (as $n\to \infty$) is

one-parameter model that relates chain shape to bulk morphology and yields
insights into the packing of anisotropic particles. In the flexible limit,
monomers occupy the sites of close-packed crystallites while chains retain
random-walk-like order. In the rodlike limit, nematic chain ordering typical of
lamellar precursors coexists with close-packing. At intermediate values of
bending stiffness the competition between random-walk-like and nematic chain
ordering produces glass-formation; the range of $k_b$ over which this occurs
increases with the thermal cooling rate $|\dot{T}|$ implemented in our

isolated networks. Yet a player, especially in human societies, will typically
be a member of many different networks, and those networks will play a
different role in the evolutionary process. Multilayer networks are therefore
rapidly gaining on popularity as the more apt description of a networked
society. With this motivation, we here consider 2-layer scale-free networks
with all possible combinations of degree mixing, wherein one network layer is
used for the accumulation of payoffs and the other is used for strategy
updating. We find that breaking the symmetry through assortative mixing in one
layer and/or disassortative mixing in the other layer, as well as preserving
the symmetry by means of assortative mixing in both layers, impedes the
evolution of cooperation. We use degree-dependent distributions of strategies
and cluster-size analysis to explain these results, which highlight the
importance of hubs and the preservation of symmetry between multilayer networks
for the successful resolution of social dilemmas.

no known candidate BHs with sub-stellar masses, these might have been produced

BHs with present day masses from $10^{-22}$ M$_{\odot}$ to $10^{-11}$

best detectors should be placed in order to identify such isolated BHs.
Broadly, we conclude that in the visible and ultraviolet BHs can be directly
detected at $d\lesssim 10^7$ m while in the X-ray band the distances might
reach $\sim10^8$ m (of the order of the Earth-Moon distance) and in the
$\gamma$-ray band BHs might even be detected from as far as $\sim 0.1$ pc.

Echidna and theta-phi actuator designs, including the restrictions caused by
the physical actuator characteristics during repositioning.
  For DESI, with theta-phi actuators, used in 5 passes over the sky for a mock
ELG/LRG/QSO sample, with matched fiber and target densities, a total target
allocation yield of 89.3% was achieved, but only 83.7% for the high-priority
Ly-alpha QSOs. If Echidna actuators are used with the same pitch and number of
passes, the yield increases by 5.7% and 16% respectively. Echidna also allows a
factor-of-two increase in the number of close Ly-alpha QSO pairs that can be
observed.
  Echidna spine tilt causes a variable loss of throughput, with average loss
being the same as the loss at the rms tilt. With a natural tilt minimization
scheme, we find an rms tilt always close to 0.58 x maximum. There is an
additional but much smaller defocus loss, equivalent to an average defocus of
30microns. These tilt losses offset the gains in yield for Echidna, but because
the survey strategy is driven by the higher priority targets, a clear survey
speed advantage remains.
  For 4MOST, high and low latitude sample mock catalogs were supplied by the
4MOST team, and allocations were carried out with the proposed Echidna-based
positioner geometry. At high latitudes, the resulting target completeness was
85.3% for LR targets and 78.9% for HR targets. At low latitude, the target

based on accurate models of agents' strategic behavior. A growing literature,
however, suggests that people do not quite behave like standard economic agents
in a variety of environments, both online and offline. What consequences might
such differences have for the optimal design of mechanisms in these
environments? In this paper, we explore this question in the context of optimal
contest design for simple agents---agents who strategically reason about
whether or not to participate in a system, but not about the input they provide
to it. Specifically, consider a contest where $n$ potential contestants with
types $(q_i,c_i)$ each choose between participating and producing a submission
of quality $q_i$ at cost $c_i$, versus not participating at all, to maximize
their utilities. How should a principal distribute a total prize $V$ amongst
the $n$ ranks to maximize some increasing function of the qualities of elicited
submissions in a contest with such simple agents?
  We first solve the optimal contest design problem for settings with
homogenous participation costs $c_i = c$. Here, the optimal contest is always a
simple contest, awarding equal prizes to the top $j^*$ contestants for a
suitable choice of $j^*$. (In comparable models with strategic effort choices,
the optimal contest is either a winner-take-all contest or awards possibly
unequal prizes, depending on the curvature of agents' effort cost functions.)
We next address the general case with heterogeneous costs where agents' types
are inherently two-dimensional, significantly complicating equilibrium
analysis. Our main result here is that the winner-take-all contest is a
3-approximation of the optimal contest when the principal's objective is to
maximize the quality of the best elicited contribution.

uniform density all having a maximum $A_V=10\,{\rm mag}$, interacting with
plane-parallel radiation. The density range in our simulations spans four
orders of magnitude ($100\le n\le 10^6\,{\rm cm}^{-3}$) and the UV field
strength spans more than three orders of magnitude ($10\le\chi\le10^{4.5}$
multiples of the ${\rm Draine}$ field), from which we generated a grid of about
1400 simulations. We compare our results with Herschel SPIRE-FTS, CSO and
ISO-LWS observations of eight CO transition lines ($J=1-0$ to $8-7$) and the
[CI] 609\mu m and [OI] 146\mu m fine structure lines. We find that the
molecular and atomic emission lines trace different gas components of NGC 4038,
thus single emission models are insufficient to reproduce the observed values.
In general, low-$J$ CO transition lines correspond to either low density
regions interacting with low UV field strengths, or high density regions
interacting with high UV field strengths. Higher $J$ CO transition lines are
less dependent on the UV field strength and are fitted by gas with density
$n\sim10^{4.5}-10^{5.2}\,{\rm cm}^{-3}$. We find that the observed fine
structure line ratio of [CI] 609\mu m/[OI] 146\mu m is reproduced by clouds
subject to weaker UV fields compared to the CO lines. We make estimates of the
$X_{\rm CO}$ factor which relates the CO emission with the column density of
molecular hydrogen, and find that it is less than the canonical Milky Way

point out some methodological issues in these studies: either the selection of

distribution is inconsistent with basic assumptions. Once these issues have

account: cluster mass, finite survey volume effects, survey masking, and a flux

measured cluster masses, and analytic models for the bias and space-density of
clusters as a function of mass and redshift. Recent studies have suggested that
the optimal method for reconstruction of the matter density field from a set of

the original power spectrum scheme of Feldman et al (1994). We show that our

flux-limited cluster surveys. Finally, we present a new expression for the
Fisher information matrix for cluster power spectrum analysis. Our expression
shows that for an optimally weighted cluster survey the cosmological

between H ii regions and turbulent molecular clouds. We propose a new method to
determine the age of a large sample of OB associations by investigating the
development of their associated H ii regions in the surrounding turbulent
medium. Using analytical solutions, one-dimensional (1D), and three-dimensional
(3D) simulations, we constrained the expansion of the ionized bubble depending
on the turbulent level of the parent molecular cloud. A grid of 1D simulations
was then computed in order to build isochrone curves for H ii regions in a
pressure-size diagram. This grid of models allowed to date large sample of OB
associations and was used on the H ii Region Discovery Survey (HRDS).
Analytical solutions and numerical simulations showed that the expansion of H
ii regions is slowed down by the turbulence up to the point where the pressure
of the ionized gas is in a quasi-equilibrium with the turbulent ram pressure.
Based on this result, we built a grid of 1D models of the expansion of H ii
regions in a profile based on Larson laws. The 3D turbulence is taken into
account by an effective 1D temperature profile. The ages estimated by the
isochrones of this grid agree well with literature values of well-known regions
such as Rosette, RCW 36, RCW 79, and M16. We thus propose that this method can
be used to give ages of young OB associations through the Galaxy such as the
HRDS survey and also in nearby extra-galactic sources.

served as a prototype to study the emergence of mixed-mode oscillations (MMOs)
in slow-fast systems, but only in this paper is the existence of these elusive
homoclinic orbits established. They are found first in a larger family that has
been used to study singular Hopf bifurcation in multiple time scale systems

homoclinic orbits in this larger family is obtained by continuation and shown
to cross the submanifold of the Koper system. The strategy used to compute the

invariant manifolds in this system with multiple time scales. Both canards and
folded nodes are multiple time scale phenomena encountered in the analysis.

operator is used. With this choice, a fast convergence of many-body
calculations can be achieved, but at the same time substantial three-body
interactions are induced even if one starts from a purely two-nucleon (NN)
Hamiltonian. Three-nucleon (3N) interactions can be handled by modern many-body
methods. However, it has been observed that when including initial chiral 3N
forces in the Hamiltonian, the SRG transformations induce a non-negligible
four-nucleon interaction that cannot be currently included in the calculations
for technical reasons. Consequently, it is essential to investigate alternative
SRG generators that might suppress the induction of many-body forces while at
the same time might preserve the good convergence. In this work we test two
alternative generators with operators of block structure in the harmonic
oscillator basis. In the no-core shell model calculations for 3H, 4He and 6Li
with chiral NN force, we demonstrate that their performances appear quite
promising.

While fitting observed frequencies with the eigenvalue condition for mixed

provides a good estimate of the coupling strength as well as period spacing

calculating both static and dynamic properties of strongly interacting

time-dependent scattering amplitudes, possibly with strong external
time-dependent fields, represent a few of the important applications. By
choosing the light-front gauge and adopting an orthonormal basis function
representation, we obtain a large, sparse, Hamiltonian matrix eigenvalue
problem for mass eigenstates that we solve by adapting ab initio no-core
methods of nuclear many-body theory. In the continuum limit, the infinite

light-front quantized theory, we adopt a two-dimensional harmonic oscillator
basis for transverse modes that corresponds with eigensolutions of the
soft-wall anti-de Sitter/quantum chromodynamics (AdS/QCD) model obtained from
light-front holography. We outline our approach and present results for
non-linear Compton scattering, evaluated non-perturbatively, where a strong and
time-dependent laser field accelerates the electron and produces states of
higher invariant mass i.e. final states with photon emission.

distribution function and density of states at band edges plays the central
role in enhancing the thermoelectric performance. Thus, an analytical
methodology that is robust on modeling the sharp change of transport

best knowledge, there has not been a paper giving the systematic study on the
analytical models of anisotropic transport distribution function for different
kinds of band valleys in different dimensions under different assumptions.
Therefore, the main focus of this present paper is to develop such a robust

broadband feature from the free carrier dissipation, and is
frequency-independent in an ultrawide spectrum, ranging typically from
kilohertz to gigahertz and exhibiting an unprecedented bandwidth close to 200%.
In particular, it occurs on extremely subwavelength scales, ~{\lambda}/10000 or

FRBs are short duration ($\sim$ 1 ms), highly dispersed radio pulses from
astronomical sources. The physical interpretation for the FRBs remains unclear
but is thought to involve highly compact objects at cosmological distance. It
has been suggested that a fraction of FRBs could be physically associated with
gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). Recent radio observations of GRBs have reported the
detection of two highly dispersed short duration radio pulses using a 12 m
radio telescope at 1.4 GHz. Motivated by this result, we have performed a
systematic and sensitive search for FRBs associated with GRBs. We have observed
five GRBs at 2.3 GHz using a 26 m radio telescope located at the Mount Pleasant
Radio Observatory, Hobart. The radio telescope was automated to rapidly respond
to Gamma-ray Coordination Network notifications from the Swift satellite and
slew to the GRB position within $\sim$ 140 s. The data were searched for pulses
up to 5000 pc $\rm cm^{-3}$ in dispersion measure and pulse widths ranging from
640 $\rm \mu$s to 25.60 ms. We did not detect any events $\rm \geq 6 \sigma$.
An in-depth statistical analysis of our data shows that events detected above
$\rm 5 \sigma$ are consistent with thermal noise fluctuations only. A joint
analysis of our data with previous experiments shows that previously claimed
detections of FRBs from GRBs are unlikely to be astrophysical. Our results are
in line with the lack of consistency noted between the recently presented FRB
event rates and GRB event rates.

corrections to the hadronic decay width of the $Z$-boson has recently been
performed by Baikov et al.[1]. In their analysis, Baikov et al. relied on the
conventional practice of simply guessing the renormalization scale and taking
an arbitrary range to estimate the pQCD uncertainties. This procedure
inevitably introduces an arbitrary, scheme-dependent theoretical systematic
error in the predictions. In this paper, we show that the renormalization scale
uncertainties for hadronic $Z$ decays can be greatly reduced by applying the
principle of maximum conformality (PMC), a rigorous extension of the BLM
method. The PMC prediction is independent of the choice of renormalization
scheme; i.e., it respects renormalization group invariance, and thus it
provides an optimal and theoretically rigorous method for setting the
renormalization scale. We show that the convergence of the pQCD prediction for
the $Z$ hadronic width is greatly improved using the PMC since the divergent
renormalon series does not appear. The magnitude of the high-order corrections
quickly approach a steady point. The PMC predictions also have the property
that any residual dependence on the choice of initial scale is highly
suppressed, even for low-order predictions. Thus, one obtains optimal
fixed-order predictions for the $Z$-boson hadronic decay rates thus enabling
high precision tests of the Standard Model.

and winds which escape to a large distance. According to Two Component
Advective Flow (TCAF) model, centrifugal pressure dominated region of the flow
just outside the black hole horizon, with or without shocks, acts as the base
of this outflow. Electrons from this region are depleted due to the wind and
consequently, energy transfer rate due to inverse Comptonization of low energy
photons are affected. Specifically, it becomes easier to cool this region and
emerging spectrum is softened. Our main goal is to show spectral softening due
to mass outflow in presence of Compton cooling. To achieve this, we modify
Rankine-Hugoniot relationships at the shock front when post-shock region
suffers mass loss due to winds and energy loss due to inverse Comptonization.
We solve two-temperature equations governing an accretion flow around a black
hole which include Coulomb exchange between protons and electrons and other
major radiative processes such as bremsstrahlung and thermal Comptonization. We
then compute emitted spectrum from this post-shock flow. We also show how
location of standing shock which forms outer boundary of centrifugal barrier
changes with cooling. With an increase in disc accretion rate $(\dot{m_d})$,
cooling is enhanced and we find that the shock moves in towards the black hole.
With cooling, thermal pressure is reduced, and as a result, outflow rate is
decreased. We thus directly correlate outflow rate with spectral state of the
disc.

our recent dataset leveraging the existing taxonomy of human activities. This
dataset includes 24,920 video snippets covering 410 human activities in total.
Our analysis reveals that holistic and pose-based methods are highly
complementary, and their performance varies significantly depending on the
activity. We find that holistic methods are mostly affected by the number and
speed of trajectories, whereas pose-based methods are mostly influenced by
viewpoint of the person. We observe striking performance differences across
activities: for certain activities results with pose-based features are more
than twice as accurate compared to holistic features, and vice versa. The best
performing approach in our comparison is based on the combination of holistic
and pose-based approaches, which again underlines their complementarity.

continuous responses, models for count data have so far received little
attention. The main quantile regression technique for count data involves
adding uniform random noise or ""jittering"", thus overcoming the problem that
the conditional quantile function is not a continuous function of the
parameters of interest. Although jittering allows estimating the conditional
quantiles, it has the drawback that, for small values of the response variable
$Y,$ the added noise can have a large influence on the estimated quantiles. In
addition, quantile regression can lead to ""crossing"" quantiles. We propose a
Bayesian Dirichlet process (DP)-based approach to quantile regression for count
data. The approach is based on an adaptive DP mixture (DPM) of COM-Poisson
regression models and determines the quantiles by estimating the density of the
data, thus eliminating all the aforementioned problems. Taking advantage of the
exchange algorithm, the proposed MCMC algorithm can be applied to distributions
on which the likelihood can only be computed up to a normalising constant.

shock waves propagating in a dusty gas environment are expressed in a simple
form in terms of dimensionless variables. The dusty gas is assumed to be a
mixture of a perfect gas and spherically small solid particles, in which solid
particles are continuously distributed. The jump relations across the MHD shock
front for the pressure, the density and the velocity of mixture have been
derived, respectively in terms of a compression ratio across the shock front in
a gas-solid particle two-phase flow. The expressions for the speed of sound,
adiabatic compressibility of mixture and the change-in-entropy across the MHD
shock front have also been derived in terms of the compression ratio. Further,
the handy forms of MHD shock jump relations have been obtained in terms of the
initial volume fraction of small solid particles and the ratio of specific
heats of the mixture, simultaneously for the two cases viz., (i) when the shock
is strong and, (ii) when it is weak. Finally, the cases of strong and weak
shocks are explored under two distinct conditions viz., (i) when the applied
magnetic field is strong and, (ii) when the field is weak. The simplified MHD
shock jump relations for dusty gas reduce to MHD shock jump relations for an
idea gas when the mass fraction of solid particles in the mixture becomes zero.
The effects due to the magnetic field, the mass fraction of solid particles in
mixture, and the ratio of the density of solid particles to the initial density
of gas are studied on the pressure, density, velocity of mixture, speed of
sound, adiabatic compressibility of mixture and the change-in-entropy across
the shock front. The results provided a clear picture of whether and how the
presence of magnetic field and dusty parameters affect the flow field behind
the MHD shock front.

mechanical computer built by the German inventor Konrad Zuse in Berlin from
1936 to 1938. The paper describes the main structural elements of the machine,
the high-level architecture, and the dataflow between components. The computer
could perform the four basic arithmetic operations using floating-point
numbers. Instructions were read from punched tape. A program consisted of a
sequence of arithmetical operations, intermixed with memory store and load
instructions, interrupted possibly by input and output operations. Numbers were
stored in a mechanical memory. The machine did not include conditional
branching in the instruction set. While the architecture of the Z1 is similar
to the relay computer Zuse finished in 1941 (the Z3) there are some significant
differences. The Z1 implements operations as sequences of microinstructions, as
in the Z3, but does not use rotary switches as micro-steppers. The Z1 uses a
digital incrementer and a set of conditions which are translated into
microinstructions for the exponent and mantissa units, as well as for the
memory blocks. Microinstructions select one out of 12 layers in a machine with
a 3D mechanical structure of binary mechanical elements. The exception circuits
for mantissa zero, necessary for normalized floating-point, were lacking; they
were first implemented in the Z3. The information for this article was
extracted from careful study of the blueprints drawn by Zuse for the
reconstruction of the Z1 for the German Technology Museum in Berlin, from some
letters, and from sketches in notebooks. Although the machine has been in
exhibition since 1989 (non-operational), no detailed high-level description of
the machine's architecture had been available. This paper fills that gap.

the main criticism of their approach, this is still a useful project. The
results are limited to algebraic curves. As well as being interesting in their
own right, it is hoped that these may also help the reader to appreciate their
sophisticated approach to algebraic surfaces and an understanding of
singularities. The constructions are also relevant to current research in
Zariski structures, which have played a major role both in model theoretic
applications to diophantine geometry and in recent work on non-commutative
geometry.

but very challenging due to the low contrast of surrounding structures in
Computed Tomography (CT) and to their varying sizes, poses, shapes and sparsely
distributed locations. State-of-the-art studies show the performance range of
52.9% sensitivity at 3.1 false-positives per volume (FP/vol.), or 60.9% at 6.1
FP/vol. for mediastinal LN, by one-shot boosting on 3D HAAR features. In this
paper, we first operate a preliminary candidate generation stage, towards 100%
sensitivity at the cost of high FP levels (40 per patient), to harvest volumes
of interest (VOI). Our 2.5D approach consequently decomposes any 3D VOI by
resampling 2D reformatted orthogonal views N times, via scale, random
translations, and rotations with respect to the VOI centroid coordinates. These
random views are then used to train a deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
classifier. In testing, the CNN is employed to assign LN probabilities for all
N random views that can be simply averaged (as a set) to compute the final
classification probability per VOI. We validate the approach on two datasets:
90 CT volumes with 388 mediastinal LNs and 86 patients with 595 abdominal LNs.
We achieve sensitivities of 70%/83% at 3 FP/vol. and 84%/90% at 6 FP/vol. in
mediastinum and abdomen respectively, which drastically improves over the
previous state-of-the-art work.

binary sequences with prescribed correlation function. The method is based on
consecutive linear modulations of initially uncorrelated sequence into a
correlated one. Each step of modulation increases the correlations until the
desired level has been reached. Robustness and efficiency for the proposed
algorithm are tested by generating sequences with inverse power-law
correlations. The substantial increase in the strength of correlation in the
iterative method with respect to the single-step filtering generation is shown
for all studied correlation functions. Our results can be used for design of
disordered superlattices, waveguides, and surfaces with selective transport
properties.

  arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:1405.0216",,,,"cond-mat.mtrl-sci nlin.PS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A recently developed nonlinear analytical model for axially loaded
thin-walled stringer-stiffened plates based on variational principles is
extended to include local buckling of the main plate. Interaction between the
weakly stable global buckling mode and the strongly stable local buckling mode
is highlighted. Highly unstable post-buckling behaviour and a progressively
changing wavelength in the local buckling mode profile is observed under
increasing compressive deformation. The analytical model is compared against
both physical experiments from the literature and finite element analysis
conducted in the commercial code Abaqus; excellent agreement is found both in
terms of the mechanical response and the predicted deflections.
