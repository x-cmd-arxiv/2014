the superfield formalism. Even if the chiral superfield which we dualize
involves an F-term, we can dualize it by virtue of the property of chiral
superfields. We apply the duality transformation rule of the neutral chiral
superfield to the ${\cal N}=(4,4)$ gauged linear sigma model for five-branes.
We also investigate the duality transformation rule of the charged chiral
superfield in the ${\cal N} = (4,4)$ gauged linear sigma model for the
$A_1$-type ALE space. In both cases we obtain the dual Lagrangians in the
superfield formalism. In the low energy limit we find that their duality
transformations are interpreted as T-duality transformations consistent with
the Buscher rule.

coarsening (AMR) has recently been demonstrated in the context of a number of
large-scale PDE-based applications. Although linear octrees, which store only
leaf octants, have an underlying tree structure by definition, it is not often
exploited in previously published mesh-related algorithms. This is because the
branches are not explicitly stored, and because the topological relationships
in meshes, such as the adjacency between cells, introduce dependencies that do
not respect the octree hierarchy. In this work we combine hierarchical and
topological relationships between octree branches to design efficient recursive
algorithms.
  We present three important algorithms with recursive implementations. The
first is a parallel search for leaves matching any of a set of multiple search
criteria. The second is a ghost layer construction algorithm that handles
arbitrarily refined octrees that are not covered by previous algorithms, which
require a 2:1 condition between neighboring leaves. The third is a universal
mesh topology iterator. This iterator visits every cell in a domain partition,
as well as every interface (face, edge and corner) between these cells. The
iterator calculates the local topological information for every interface that
it visits, taking into account the nonconforming interfaces that increase the
complexity of describing the local topology. To demonstrate the utility of the
topology iterator, we use it to compute the numbering and encoding of
higher-order $C^0$ nodal basis functions.
  We analyze the complexity of the new recursive algorithms theoretically, and
assess their performance, both in terms of single-processor efficiency and in
terms of parallel scalability, demonstrating good weak and strong scaling up to
458k cores of the JUQUEEN supercomputer.

the same key for encryption as well as decryption thus making it faster

yield stress, which, for one of the suspensions, varied substantially in value
and seemingly at random from one run to the next, such that the up flow-curve
appeared to be quite irreproducible. The down-curve was not though, as neither

three parts to a good approximation: a viscous component proportional to a
plastic viscosity, a constant isostatic contribution, and a third shear-rate
dependent contribution associated with the particulate network which decreased
with increasing shear-rate raised to the -7/10th power. In the case of the
second suspension, the stress could be decomposed along similar lines, although
the strain-rate softening of the solid-phase stress was found to be logarithmic

in the light of recent simulations and they conform to a very simple but

be far beyond the capabilities of current and (near) future experiments in
particle physics. By performing a general analysis of the potential
misalignment between quark masses and Yukawa couplings, we derive predictions
for the magnitude of induced flavor-changing neutral currents (FCNCs),
depending on the shift in the physical Yukawa coupling of first-generation
quarks. We find that a shift of -100% in the down-quark Yukawa Y_d would
generically result in ds transitions in conflict with Kaon physics. This could
already be seen as evidence for a non-vanishing direct coupling of the down
quark to the newly discovered Higgs boson. The non-observation of certain,
already well-constrained, processes is thus turned into a powerful indirect
measure of physical parameters of the effective Standard-Model, which are so
far basically unconstrained from experiment and extremely challenging to access
with other methods. In particular, we can already deduce that Y_d should vary
at most by ~50% from its Standard Model value, barring an alignment of new
physics effects with the SM Yukawa couplings. Such an (orthogonal) alignment
scenario is however in general much easier to test at the LHC. Similarly,
improvements in limits on FCNCs in the up-type quark sector can lead to
valuable information on the physical Yukawa coupling of the up-quark.

within +/-35 deg. to the normal of the light bridge axis. Many of them are
clustered near the central part within a 2 arcsec area. The jets are seen to
move rapidly along the light bridge and most of them cannot be identified in
successive images taken with a 2 min cadence. The jets are primarily located on
one side of the light bridge and are directed into the umbral core. The Stokes
profiles at or close to the location of the blobs on the LB exhibit both a
significant net circular polarization and multiple components, including
opposite-polarity lobes. The magnetic field diverges from the light bridge
towards the umbral cores that it separates. In the photosphere there is a
predominantly uni-directional flow with speeds of 100-150 m/s along the light
bridge which is interrupted by a patch of weak motions that also moves along
the light bridge. The dynamic short-lived jets above the LB seem to be guided
by the magnetic field lines. Reconnection events are a likely trigger for such
phenomenon since they occur at locations where the magnetic field changes
orientation sharply. We find no clear relation between the jets and the

atomic-sized kink pairs susceptible of being studied using molecular dynamics
(MD). However, MD's natural inability to properly sample thermally-activated
processes as well as to capture $\{110\}$ screw dislocation glide calls for the
development of other methods capable of overcoming these limitations. Here we
develop a kinetic Monte Carlo (kMC) approach to study single screw dislocation
dynamics from room temperature to $0.5T_m$ and at stresses
$0<\sigma<0.9\sigma_P$, where $T_m$ and $\sigma_P$ are the melting point and
the Peierls stress. The method is entirely parameterized with atomistic
simulations using an embedded atom potential for tungsten. To increase the
physical fidelity of our simulations, we calculate the deviations from Schmid's
law prescribed by the interatomic potential used and we study single
dislocation kinetics using both projections. We calculate dislocation
velocities as a function of stress, temperature, and dislocation line length.
We find that considering non-Schmid effects has a strong influence on both the
magnitude of the velocities and the trajectories followed by the dislocation.
We finish by condensing all the calculated data into effective stress and
temperature dependent mobilities to be used in more homogenized numerical
methods.

Selfconsistent balance between the MJSC temperature and efficiency was imposed

increase can be achieved by improving the heat dissipation using radiators and
bringing the MJSC emissivity to unity, that is closer to black body radiation

the Schroedinger equation for lepton-proton bound states, using the
renormalization group procedure for effective particles (RGPEP) in quantum
field theory, executed only up to the second order of expansion in powers of
the coupling constant. Already in this crude approximation, the extraction of
size of a proton from bound-state observables is found to depend on the lepton
mass, so that the smaller the lepton mass the larger the proton size extracted
from the same observable bound-state energy splitting. In comparison of
Hydrogen and muon-proton bound-state dynamics, the crude calculation suggests
that the difference between extracted proton sizes in these two cases can be a
few percent. Such values would match the order of magnitude of currently
discussed proton-size differences in leptonic atoms. Calculations using the
RGPEP of higher order than second are required for a precise interpretation of
the energy splittings in terms of the proton size in the Schroedinger equation.
Such calculations should resolve the conceptual discrepancy between two
conditions: that the renormalization group scale required for high accuracy
calculations based on the Schroedinger equation is much smaller than the proton
mass (on the order of a root of the product of reduced and average masses of
constituents) and that the energy splittings due to the physical proton size
can be interpreted ignoring corrections due to the effective nature of
constituents in the Schr\""odinger equation.

dominant solution(\textit{cp$6$} and \textit{cp$7$}), it could be distinguished
from canonical quintessence and tachyon models since the sound speed $c_s^2=0$
or $c_s^2\ll 1$. For the scaling solution (\textit{cp$8$}), it is very
interesting that the sound speed $c_s^2=1/5$ while it behaves as ordinary
matter. We therefore point out that the power-law kinetic quintessence should
have different signatures on cold dark matter power spectrum and cosmic
microwave background both at early time when this scalar field is an early dark
energy with $\Omega_\phi$ being non-negligible at high redshift and at late
time when it drives the accelerating expansion. We even do not know whether
there are any degeneracies of the impacts between these two epoches. They are
expected to be investigated in future.

planes of the dark matter halo remains somewhat uncertain, a time-varying disk
orientation with respect to an inertial reference frame seems probable.
Hierarchical structure formation models predict that the dark matter halo is
triaxial and tumbles with a characteristic rate of ~2 rad/Hubble time (~30
muas/yr). These models also predict a time-dependent accretion of gas, such
that the angular momentum vector of the disk should be misaligned with that of
the halo. These effects, as well as tidal effects of the LMC, will result in
the rotation of the angular momentum vector of the disk population with respect
to the quasar reference frame. We assess the accuracy with which the positions
and proper motions from Gaia can be referred to a kinematically non-rotating
system, and show that the spin vector of the transformation from any rigid
self-consistent catalog frame to the quasi-inertial system defined by quasars
should be defined to better than 1 muas/yr. Determination of this inertial
frame by Gaia will reveal any signature of the disk orientation varying with
time, improve models of the potential and dynamics of the Milky Way, test
theories of gravity, and provide new insights into the orbital evolution of the

visual matching plays a critical role in improving retrieval performance.
Conventionally, local cues of a keypoint are employed. However, such strategy
does not consider the contextual evidences of a keypoint, a problem which would
lead to the prevalence of false matches. To address this problem, this paper
defines ""true match"" as a pair of keypoints which are similar on three levels,
i.e., local, regional, and global. Then, a principled probabilistic framework
is established, which is capable of implicitly integrating discriminative cues
from all these feature levels.
  Specifically, the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is employed to extract
features from regional and global patches, leading to the so-called ""Deep
Embedding"" framework. CNN has been shown to produce excellent performance on a
dozen computer vision tasks such as image classification and detection, but few
works have been done on BoW based image retrieval. In this paper, firstly we
show that proper pre-processing techniques are necessary for effective usage of
CNN feature. Then, in the attempt to fit it into our model, a novel indexing
structure called ""Deep Indexing"" is introduced, which dramatically reduces
memory usage.
  Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that, the
proposed Deep Embedding method greatly promotes the retrieval accuracy when CNN
feature is integrated. We show that our method is efficient in terms of both

on the dimension of the model. Therefore, to control this error, an enormous
number of particles are required, which means a heavy computational burden that
is often so great it is simply prohibitive. Rebeschini and van Handel (2013)
consider particle filtering in a large-scale dynamic random field. Through a
suitable localisation operation, they prove that a modified particle filtering
algorithm can achieve an approximation error that is mostly independent of the
problem dimension. To achieve this feat, they inadvertently introduce a
systematic bias that is spatially dependent (in that the bias at one site is
dependent on the location of that site). This bias consequently varies
throughout field. In this work, a simple extension to the algorithm of
Rebeschini and van Handel is introduced which acts to average this bias term
over each site in the field through a kind of spatial smoothing. It is shown
that for a certain class of random field it is possible to achieve a completely
spatially uniform bound on the bias and that in any general random field the
spatial inhomogeneity is significantly reduced when compared to the case in
which spatial smoothing is not considered. While the focus is on spatial
averaging in this work, the proposed algorithm seemingly exhibits other
advantageous properties such as improved robustness and accuracy in those cases
in which the underlying dynamic field is time varying.

recurrent network within which the stimulus is being processed. Here we compute
the distribution of orientation selectivity in randomly connected model
networks that are equipped with different spatial patterns of connectivity. We
show that, for a wide variety of connectivity patterns, a linear theory based
on firing rates accurately approximates the outcome of direct numerical
simulations of networks of spiking neurons. Distance dependent connectivity in
networks with a more biologically realistic structure does not compromise our
linear analysis, as long as the linearized dynamics, and hence the uniform

to link with each other. As the DNA density increases, the systems shows a
percolation transition between a gas of unlinked rings and a network of linked
loops which spans the whole system. Close to the percolation transition, we
find that the mean valency of the network, i.e. the average number of loops
which are linked to any one loop, is around 3 as found experimentally for the
Kinetoplast DNA. Even more importantly, by simulating the digestion of the
network by a restriction enzyme, we show that the distribution of oligomers,
i.e. structures formed by a few loops which remain linked after digestion,
quantitatively matches experimental data obtained from gel electrophoresis,
provided that the density is, once again, close to the percolation transition.
With respect to previous work, our analysis builds on a reduced number of
assumptions, yet can still fully explain the experimental data. Our findings
suggest that the Kinetoplast DNA can be viewed as a network of linked loops
positioned very close to the percolation transition, and we discuss the
possible biological implications of this remarkable fact.

broadcasting in a communication system with multiple energy harvesting
transmitters and multiple receivers is studied. First, regarding the
transmitters as a 'hole transmitter' [1], the optimal total transmission power
is obtained and the optimal power allocation policy in [2] is extended to our
system setup, with the aim of minimizing the transmission completion time.
Then, a simpler power allocation policy is developed to allocate the optimal
total transmission power to the data transmissions. As transmitter switching
can provide flexibility and robustness to an energy harvesting communication
system, especially when a transmitter is broken or the energy harvested by a
transmitter is insufficient, a transmitter switching policy is further
developed to choose a suitable transmitter to work whenever necessary. The
results show that the proposed power allocation policy performs close to the
optimal one and outperforms some heuristic ones in terms of transmission
completion time. Besides, the proposed transmitter switching policy outperforms
some heuristic ones in terms of number of switches.

promotes the increasing of any atomic-probabilities jumps generally, but
decreasing of the action of 'potential' field generated by the atoms of defined

assumed an initial star with homogeneous energy density. The aim of this work
is to generalize the previous models by introducing an initial inhomogeneous
energy density and compare it to the initial homogeneous energy density
collapse model. We will show the differences between these models in the
evolution of all physical quantities that characterizes the gravitational
collapse. The behavior of the energy density, pressure, mass, luminosity and
the effective adiabatic index is analyzed. The pressure of the star, at the
beginning of the collapse, is isotropic but due to the presence of the shear
the pressure becomes more and more anisotropic. The black hole is never formed
because the apparent horizon formation condition is never satisfied, in
contrast of the previous model where a black hole is formed. An observer at
infinity sees a radial point source radiating exponentially until reaches the
time of maximum luminosity and suddenly the star turns off. In contrast of the
former model where the luminosity also increases exponentially, reaching a
maximum and after it decreases until the formation of the black hole. The
effective adiabatic index is always positive without any discontinuity in
contrast of the former model where there is a discontinuity around the time of
maximum luminosity. The collapse is about three thousand times slower than in
the case where the energy density is initially homogeneous.

As a result, a universal encoder can communicate over all channels in the

constructed. Both the closed and open conformations were simulated with
classical molecular dynamics on the 100 ns time scale.
Quantum-mechanics/molecular-mechanics calculations on snapshots then revealed
the features of the active site that enable the facile H2 cleavage. The
hydroxyl group of the pyridinol ligand can easily be deprotonated. With the
deprotonated hydroxyl group and the structural arrangement in the closed
conformation, H2 coordinated to the Fe center is subject to an ionic and
orbital push-pull effect and can be rapidly cleaved with a concerted hydride
transfer to methenyl-H4MPT+. An intermediary hydride species is not formed.

classical result of Glassey-Strauss (1986) to data with non-compact momentum
support. Second, we extend the methods in our companion paper (Part I) to show

the position of the impurity atom in such devices which together with the

gated geometry allows additional control over the electrostatics as can be seen
from the total energy surfaces (for a specific charge state) which is sensitive
to the positions of the impurity. These devices which are operational at room

based single dopant devices functional at low temperature. The present approach
could be a very powerful tool for the detection and control of individual
impurity atoms in a single molecular device and for applications in future

samples than the sampling theorem requires since they are usually sparse.
Unavailable randomly positioned samples can result from heavily corrupted parts
of the signal. Since these samples can be omitted and declared as unavailable,
the application of the compressive sensing methods in the recovery of heavily
corrupted signal and radar images is possible. A\ simple direct method for the
recovery of unavailable signal samples and the calculation of the restored ISAR
image is reviewed. An analysis of the noise influence is performed. For fast
maneuvering ISAR targets the sparsity property is lost since the ISAR image is
blurred. A nonparametric quadratic time-frequency representations based method
is used to restore the ISAR image sparsity. However, the linear relation
between the signal and the sparsity domain transformation is lost. A recently
proposed gradient recovery algorithm is adapted for this kind of analysis. It
does not require the linear relation of the signal and its sparsity domain
transformation in the process of unavailable data recovery. The presented
methods and results are tested on several numerical examples proving the
expected accuracy and improvements.

$J_K$ = 2$_K$--1$_K$, and CH$_3$CN $J_K$ = 6$_K$--5$_K$) in the nearby Seyfert
2 galaxy NGC 1068 observed with the ALMA early science program. The central
$\sim$1 arcmin ($\sim$4.3 kpc) of this galaxy was observed in the 100 GHz
region covering $\sim$96--100 GHz and $\sim$108--111 GHz with an angular
resolution of $\sim4""\times2""$ (290 pc$\times$140 pc) to study the effects of
an active galactic nucleus and its surrounding starburst ring on molecular
abundances. Here, we present images and report a classification of molecular
distributions into three main categories: (1) Molecules concentrated in the
circumnuclear disk (CND) (SO $J_N$ = 3$_2$--2$_1$, HC$_3$N $J$ = 11--10,
12--11, and CH$_3$CN $J_K$ = 6$_K$--5$_K$), (2) Molecules distributed both in
the CND and the starburst ring (CS $J$ = 2--1 and CH$_3$OH $J_K$ =
2$_K$--1$_K$), (3) Molecules distributed mainly in the starburst ring
($^{13}$CO $J$ = 1--0 and C$^{18}$O $J$ = 1--0). Since most of the molecules
such as HC$_3$N observed in the CND are easily dissociated by UV photons and
X-rays, our results indicate that these molecules must be effectively shielded.
In the starburst ring, the relative intensity of methanol at each clumpy region
is not consistent with those of $^{13}$CO, C$^{18}$O, and CS. This difference
is probably caused by the unique formation and destruction mechanisms of
CH$_3$OH.

Possible substitutional and interstitial graphene-based superstructures are
predicted and described. The arrangements of dopants over sites or interstices
related with interatomic-interaction energies governing the configurations of
impurities. Depending on whether the interatomic interactions are short- or
long-range, the low-temperature stability diagrams in terms of
interaction-energy parameters are obtained. The dominance of intersublattice
interactions in competition with intrasublattice ones results in a nonmonotony
of ordering-process kinetics. Spatial correlations of impurities do not affect
the electronic conductivity of graphene for the most important
experimentally-relevant cases of point defects, neutral adatoms and screened
charged impurities, while atomic ordering can give rise in the conductivity up
to tens times for weak and strong short-range potentials. There is no ordering
effect manifestation for long-range potentials. The anisotropy of the
conductivity along and across the line defects is revealed and gives rise in
the conductivity of graphene with correlated line defects as compared with the
case of random ones. Simultaneously correlated (and/or ordered) point and line
defects in graphene can give rise in the conductivity up to hundreds times vs.
their random distribution. On an example of different B or N doping
configurations in graphene, results from the Kubo-Greenwood approach are
