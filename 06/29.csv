spectrum of magnons propagating within the Fe2O4 bilayers of LuFe2O4. The
observed spectrum is consistent with six magnetic modes and a single prominent
gap, which is compatible with a single bilayer magnetic unit cell containing
six spins. We model the magnon dispersion by linear spin-wave theory and find
very good agreement with the domain-averaged spectrum of a spin-charge bilayer
superstructure comprising one Fe3+ -rich monolayer and one Fe2+ -rich
monolayer. These findings indicate the existence of polar bilayers in LuFe2O4,
contrary to recent studies that advocate a charge-segregated non-polar bilayer
model. Weak scattering observed below the magnon gap suggests that a fraction
of the bilayers contain other combinations of charged monolayers not included
in the model. Refined values for the dominant exchange interactions are
reported.

questions in black hole (BH) astrophysics. In order to constrain these
mechanisms, we analyze the energy efficiency of jet production 'eta' based on
archival Chandra observations of 27 nearby, low-luminosity active galactic
nuclei. We obtain 'eta' as the ratio of the jet power, inferred from the
energetics of jet powered X-ray emitting cavities, to the BH mass accretion
rate Mdot_BH. The standard assumption in estimating Mdot_BH is that all the gas
from the Bondi radius 'r_B' makes it down to the BH. It is now clear, however,
that only a small fraction of the gas reaches the hole. To account for this
effect, we use the standard disk mass-loss scaling, Mdot(r) \propto (r/r_B)^s
Mdot_Bondi. This leads to much lower values of Mdot_BH and higher values of
'eta' than in previous studies. If hot accretion flows are characterized by
0.5<s<0.6 -- on the lower end of recent theoretical and observational studies
-- then dynamically-important magnetic fields near rapidly spinning BHs are
necessary to account for the high eta~100-300 per cent in the sample. Moreover,
values of s>0.6 are essentially ruled out, or there would be insufficient
energy to power the jets. We discuss the implications of our results for the
distribution of massive BH spins and the possible impact of a significant extra
cold gas supply on our estimates.

Theories must account for the relative difficulty of acquiring different
concepts by supervised learners. For a canonical set of six category types, two
distinct orderings of classification difficulty have been found. One ordering,
which we call paradigm-specific, occurs when adult human learners classify
objects with easily distinguishable characteristics such as size, shape, and
shading. The general order occurs in all other known cases: when adult humans
classify objects with characteristics that are not readily distinguished (e.g.,
brightness, saturation, hue); for children and monkeys; and when categorization
difficulty is extrapolated from errors in identification learning. The
paradigm-specific order was found to be predictable mathematically by measuring
the logical complexity of tasks, i.e., how concisely the solution can be
represented by logical rules.
  However, logical complexity explains only the paradigm-specific order but not
the general order. Here we propose a new difficulty measurement, information
complexity, that calculates the amount of uncertainty remaining when a subset
of the dimensions are specified. This measurement is based on Shannon entropy.
We show that, when the metric extracts minimal uncertainties, this new
measurement predicts the paradigm-specific order for the canonical six category
types, and when the metric extracts average uncertainties, this new measurement
predicts the general order. Moreover, for learning category types beyond the
canonical six, we find that the minimal-uncertainty formulation correctly
predicts the paradigm-specific order as well or better than existing metrics
(Boolean complexity and GIST) in most cases.

primarily the product of binary evolution, challenging the traditional
single-star view wherein LBVs mark a brief transition between massive O stars
and Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars. If the latter were true, then LBVs should be
concentrated in young clusters and found alongside main-sequence stars with
similarly high inferred initial mass. This is decidedly not the case. Examining
locations of LBVs compared to O stars in our Galaxy and the Magellanic Clouds
reveals that LBVs systematically avoid clusters of O stars, and many reside
over 100 pc from any O star. In the LMC, LBVs are statistically much more
isolated than O-type stars, and (perhaps most surprisingly) even more isolated
than most WR stars. This makes it impossible for LBVs to be massive stars in
transition to WR stars. Instead, we propose that massive stars and supernova
(SN) subtypes are dominated by bifurcated evolutionary paths in interacting
binaries, wherein most WR stars and SNeIbc correspond to the mass donors, while
LBVs (and their lower-mass analogs like B[e] supergiants, which we show to be
even more isolated) are the mass gainers. LBVs are essentially the late
evolutionary stage of massive blue stragglers. Through binary mass transfer,
rejuvinated mass gainers get enriched, spun up, and sometimes kicked far from
their clustered birthsites by their companion's SN. This scenario agrees better
with LBVs exploding as SNeIIn and the observed isolation of SNe~IIn and SN
impostors. We argue that environmental trends of various SN subtypes are
influenced more by binarity and SN kicks, rather than tracing initial mass as
is generally assumed. Mergers or Thorne-Zykow objects might also give rise to
LBVs, but these scenarios may have a harder time explaining why LBVs avoid
clusters.

necessary condition for a well-functioning democracy. Recently, there have been
claims that viewpoint diversity is diminishing in online social networks,
putting users in a ""bubble"", where they receive political information which
they agree with. The contributions from our investigations are fivefold: (1) we
introduce different dimensions of the highly complex value viewpoint diversity
using political theory; (2) we provide an overview of the metrics used in the
literature of viewpoint diversity analysis; (3) we operationalize new metrics
using the theory and provide a framework to analyze viewpoint diversity in
Twitter for different political cultures; (4) we share our results for a case
study on minorities we performed for Turkish and Dutch Twitter users; (5) we
show that minority users cannot reach a large percentage of Turkish Twitter
users. With the last of these contributions, using theory from communication
scholars and philosophers, we show how minority access is missing from the
typical dimensions of viewpoint diversity studied by computer scientists and
the impact it has on viewpoint diversity analysis.

taken place and many aspects are well understood by now, the topology, geometry
and evolution of the crack system hydraulically produced in the shale still
remains an enigma. Expert opinions differ widely and fracture mechanicians must
wonder why fracking works. Fracture mechanics of individual pressurized cracks
has recently been clarified but the vital problem of stability of interacting
hydraulic cracks escaped attention. Progress in this regard would likely allow
optimization of fracking and reduction of environmental footprint. The present
article first focuses on the classical solutions of the critical states of
localization instability of a system of cooling or shrinkage cracks and shows
that these solutions can be transferred to the system of hydraulic cracks. It
is concluded that if the profile of hydraulic pressure along the cracks can be
made almost uniform, with a steep pressure drop at the front, the localization
instability can be avoided. To achieve this kind of profile the pumping rate
(corrected for the leak rate) must not be too high. Subsequently, numerical
solutions are presented to show that an idealized system of circular
equidistant vertical cracks propagating from a horizontal borehole behaves
similarly. It is pointed out that one important role of proppants, as well as
acids that promote creation debris in the new cracks, is that they partially
help to limit crack closings and thus localization. Based on the extremely low
permeability of gas shale, one must imagine a hierarchical progressively
refined crack systems in which the finest cracks have spacing in the
sub-centimeter range. The overall conclusion is that what makes fracking work
is the suppression or mitigation of localization instabilities of crack
systems, which requires achieving uniform pressure profiles along the cracks.

L1-regularized optimization problem. To avoid optimizing over a fully linked
model, gain-based or gradient-based feature selection methods start from an
empty model and incrementally add top ranked features to it. However, for
high-dimensional problems like statistical relational learning, training time
of these incremental methods can be dominated by the cost of evaluating the
gain or gradient of a large collection of candidate features. In this study we
propose a fast feature evaluation algorithm called Contrastive Feature
Induction (CFI), which only evaluates a subset of features that involve both
variables with high signals (deviation from mean) and variables with high
errors (residue). We prove that the gradient of candidate features can be
represented solely as a function of signals and errors, and that CFI is an
efficient approximation of gradient-based evaluation methods. Experiments on
synthetic and real data sets show competitive learning speed and accuracy of
CFI on pairwise CRFs, compared to state-of-the-art structure learning methods

further assumption is made regarding the smoothness and the structure of the

Pentachotomy (SP) algorithm, and derive finite-time upper bounds on its regret

function $\mu$ that behaves as $\mu(x)=\mu(x^\star)-C|x-x^\star|^\xi$ locally
around its maximizer $x^\star$ for some $\xi, C>0$, the SP algorithm is
order-optimal. Namely its regret and optimization error scale as
$O(\sqrt{T\log(T)})$ and $O(\sqrt{\log(T)/T})$, respectively, when the time
horizon $T$ grows large. These scalings are achieved without the knowledge of
$\xi$ and $C$. Our algorithm is based on asymptotically optimal sequential
statistical tests used to successively trim an interval that contains the best
arm with high probability. To our knowledge, the SP algorithm constitutes the
first sequential arm selection rule that achieves a regret and optimization
error scaling as $O(\sqrt{T})$ and $O(1/\sqrt{T})$, respectively, up to a
logarithmic factor for non-smooth expected reward functions, as well as for
smooth functions with unknown smoothness.

photometric data, we confirm that WASP-67 b shows grazing eclipses and compute
accurate estimates of the physical properties of the planet and its parent
star. Methods. We present high-quality, multi-colour, broad-band photometric
observations comprising five light curves covering two transit events, obtained
using two medium-class telescopes and the telescope-defocussing technique. One
transit was observed through a Bessel-R filter and the other simultaneously
through filters similar to Sloan griz. We modelled these data using jktebop.
The physical parameters of the system were obtained from the analysis of these
light curves and from published spectroscopic measurements. Results. All five
of our light curves satisfy the criterion for being grazing eclipses. We revise
the physical parameters of the whole WASP-67 system and, in particular,
significantly improve the measurements of the planet's radius and density as
compared to the values in the discovery paper. The transit ephemeris was also
substantially refined. We investigated the variation of the planet's radius as
a function of the wavelength, using the simultaneous multi-band data, finding
that our measurements are consistent with a flat spectrum to within the
experimental uncertainties.

protected gapless modes on their surfaces. Breaking the symmetries that
underlie the gapless nature of the surface modes is predicted to give rise to
exotic new states of matter. In particular, it has recently been predicted and
shown that breaking of time reversal symmetry in the form of ferromagnetism can
give rise to a gapped state characterized by a zero magnetic field quantized
Hall response and dissipationless longitudinal transport known as the Quantum
Anomalous Hall (QAH) state. A key question that has thus far remained
experimentally unexplored is the relationship of this new type of quantum Hall
state with the previously known orbitally driven quantum Hall states. Here, we
show experimentally that a ferromagnetic topological insulator exhibiting the
QAH state is well described by the global phase diagram of the quantum Hall
effect. By mapping the behavior of the conductivity tensor in the parameter
space of temperature, magnetic field, and chemical potential in the vicinity of
the QAH phase, we find evidence for quantum criticality and delocalization
behavior that can quantitatively be described by the renormalization group
properties of the quantum Hall ground state. This result demonstrates that the
QAH state observed in ferromagnetic topological insulators can be understood
within the context of the law of corresponding states which governs the quantum
Hall state. This suggests a roadmap for studying the QAH effect including
transitions to possible adjacent topologically non-trivial states and a
possible universality class for the QAH transition.

equations. In these elements, the matrix-valued stress field is approximated by
the full $C^0$-$P_k$ space enriched by $(k-1)$ $H(\d)$ edge bubble functions on
each internal edge, while the displacement field by the full discontinuous
$P_{k-1}$ vector-valued space, for the polynomial degree $k\ge 3$. The main
challenge is to find the correct stress finite element space matching the full
$C^{-1}$-$P_{k-1}$ displacement space. The discrete stability analysis for the
inf-sup condition does not rely on the usual Fortin operator, which is
difficult to construct. It is done by characterizing the divergence of local
stress space which covers the $P_{k-1}$ space of displacement orthogonal to the
local rigid-motion. The well-posedness condition and the optimal a priori error
estimate are proved for this family of finite elements. Numerical tests are
presented to confirm the theoretical results.

we consider an equivalent formulation with a nonuniformly elliptic operator as

truncation that is suitable for numerical approximation. We discretize the
proposed truncated state equation using first degree tensor product finite
elements on anisotropic meshes. For the control problem we analyze two
approaches: one that is semi-discrete based on the so-called variational
approach, where the control is not discretized, and the other one is fully
discrete via the discretization of the control by piecewise constant functions.
For both approaches, we derive a priori error estimates with respect to the
degrees of freedom. Numerical experiments validate the derived error estimates
and reveal a competitive performance of anisotropic over quasi-uniform

characterizing a bar, i.e., its length ($a$) and ellipticity ($e$), to face-on
values before any careful analyses. However, systematic estimation on the
uncertainties of the commonly used deprojection methods is still lacking.
Simulated galaxies are well suited in this study. We project two simulated
barred galaxies onto a 2D plane with different bar orientations and disk
inclination angles ($i$). Bar properties are measured and deprojected with the
popular deprojection methods in the literature. Generally speaking,
deprojection uncertainties increase with increasing $i$. All the deprojection
methods behave badly when $i$ is larger than $60^\circ$, due to vertical
thickness of the bar. Thus, future statistical studies of barred galaxies
should exclude galaxies more inclined than $60^\circ$. At moderate inclination
angles ($i\leq60^\circ$), 2D deprojection methods (analytical and image
stretching) and Fourier-based methods (Fourier decomposition and bar-interbar
contrast) perform reasonably well with uncertainties $\sim10\%$ in both the bar
length and ellipticity. Whereas the uncertainties of the 1D analytical
deprojection can be as high as $100\%$ in certain extreme case.
  We find that different bar measurement methods show systematic differences in
the deprojection uncertainties. We further discuss the deprojection uncertainty
factors with the emphasis on the most important one, i.e., the 3D structure of
the bar itself. We construct two triaxial toy bar models that can qualitatively
reproduce the results of the 1D and 2D analytical deprojections; they confirm
that the vertical thickness of the bar is the main source of uncertainties.

resolved in the NMR spectra, with distinct quadrupole frequencies $\nu _{Q}$,
magnetic shifts $K_{ZZ}$ and nuclear spin lattice relaxation rates $% 1/T_{1}$.
Contrary to the $x=1/2$ or $x=2/3$ phases the 3D stacking of the Na planes is
not perfect for $x=0.77$ but this does not influence markedly the electronic
properties. We evidence that the magnetic and charge properties of the Co sites
are highly correlated with each other as $K_{ZZ}$ and $(1/T_{1})^{1/2}$ scale
linearly with $\nu _{Q}$. The data analysis allows us to separate the
contribution $\nu_{Q}^{latt}$ of the ionic charges to $\nu _{Q}$ from that $\nu
_{Q}^{el}$ due to the hole orbitals on the Co sites. We could extend coherently
this analysis to all the known phases in the Na cobaltate phase diagram. The
variation with $x$ of $\nu _{Q}^{latt}$ is found to fit rather well numerical
computations done in a point charge model. The second term $\nu _{Q}^{el}$

Mixing which come from different flavor symmetries at the GUT scale. We find
that the Majorana phases play an important role in the RGE running of these
mixing patterns along with the seesaw threshold corrections. We present a

Our main result, is that on a surface of general type there are only finitely
many curves with negative self--intersection and sufficiently large canonical
degree. Our proof strongly relies on results by Miyaoka. We extend our result
both to surfaces not of general type and to non--negative curves, and give
applications, e.g. to finiteness of negative curves on a general blow--up of
$\mathbb P^ 2$ at $n\geq 10$ general points (a result related to \emph{Nagata's
Conjecture}). We finally discuss a conjecture by Vojta concerning the
asymptotic behaviour of the ratio between the canonical degree and the
geometric genus of a curve varying on a surface. The results in this paper go
in the direction of understanding the \emph{bounded negativity} problem.

the fine structure constant, $\alpha$, or of the mass of the electron, $m_e$,
would affect the recombination history of the Universe and cause an imprint on
the cosmic microwave background angular power spectra. We show that the Planck
data allow one to improve the constraint on the time variation of the fine
structure constant at redshift $z\sim 10^3$ by about a factor of 5 compared to
WMAP data, as well as to break the degeneracy with the Hubble constant, $H_0$.
In addition to $\alpha$, we can set a constraint on the variation of the mass
of the electron, $m_{\rm e}$, and on the simultaneous variation of the two
constants. We examine in detail the degeneracies between fundamental constants
and the cosmological parameters, in order to compare the limits obtained from
Planck and WMAP and to determine the constraining power gained by including
other cosmological probes. We conclude that independent time variations of the
fine structure constant and of the mass of the electron are constrained by
Planck to ${\Delta\alpha}/{\alpha}= (3.6\pm 3.7)\times10^{-3}$ and ${\Delta
m_{\rm e}}/{m_{\rm e}}= (4 \pm 11)\times10^{-3}$ at the 68% confidence level.
We also investigate the possibility of a spatial variation of the fine
structure constant. The relative amplitude of a dipolar spatial variation of
$\alpha$ (corresponding to a gradient across our Hubble volume) is constrained
to be $\delta\alpha/\alpha=(-2.4\pm 3.7)\times 10^{-2}$.

massive MIMO systems with i.i.d. channels is disappointing compared with that
of time-division-duplex (TDD) systems, due to the prohibitively large overhead
for acquiring channel state information at the transmitter (CSIT). In this
paper, we investigate the achievable rates of FDD massive MIMO systems with
spatially correlated channels, considering the CSIT acquisition dimensionality
loss, the imperfection of CSIT and the regularized-zero-forcing linear
precoder. The achievable rates are optimized by judiciously designing the
downlink channel training sequences and user CSIT feedback codebooks,
exploiting the multiuser spatial channel correlation. We compare our achievable
rates with TDD massive MIMO systems, i.i.d. FDD systems, and the joint spatial
division and multiplexing (JSDM) scheme, by deriving the deterministic
equivalents of the achievable rates, based on popular channel models. It is
shown that, based on the proposed eigenspace channel estimation schemes, the
rate-gap between FDD systems and TDD systems is significantly narrowed, even
approached under moderate number of base station antennas. Compared to the JSDM
scheme, our proposal achieves dimensionality-reduction channel estimation
without channel pre-projection, and higher throughput for moderate number of
antennas and moderate to large channel coherence time, though at higher
computational complexity.

this in the framework of the SU(3) Polyakov linear sigma-model (PLSM). To this
end, we implement two approaches representing two systems, in which the
Polyakov-loop potential added to PLMS either renormalized or non-normalized.
The effects of Landau quantization on the strongly interacting matter is
conjectures to reduce the electromagnetic interactions between quarks. In this
case, the color interactions will be dominant and increasing, which - in turn -
can be achieved by increasing of the Polyakov-loop fields. Obviously, each of

weighting, where the weights determine the prioritization order, can be
important in multiple-input multiple-output interference channels. In this
letter, a distributed algorithm is proposed for the problem of power
minimization subject to weighted SINR constraint. The algorithm is based on two
basic features, the well known distributed power control algorithm by Yates in
1995 and a simple linear search to find feasible SINR targets. The power
control law used in the proposed algorithm is proven to linearly converge to a
unique fixed-point.

semantics of programming languages'. Domains form the basis of a theory of
partial information, which extends the familiar notion of partial function to
encompass a whole spectrum of ""degrees of definedness"", so as to model
incremental higher-order computation (i.e., computing with infinite data
values, such as functions defined over an infinite domain like the domain of
integers, infinite trees, and such as objects of object-oriented programming).
General considerations from recursion theory dictate that partial functions are
unavoidable in any discussion of computability. Domain theory provides an
appropriately abstract setting in which the notion of a partial function can be
lifted and used to give meaning to higher types, recursive types, etc. NOOP is
a domain-theoretic model of nominally-typed OOP. NOOP was used to prove the
identification of inheritance and subtyping in mainstream nominally-typed OO
programming languages and the validity of this identification. In this report
we first present the definitions of basic domain theoretic notions and domain
constructors used in the construction of NOOP, then we present the construction
of a simple structural model of OOP called COOP as a step towards the
construction of NOOP. Like the construction of NOOP, the construction of COOP
uses earlier presented domain constructors.

that the stacking assembly of the model protein on graphene could be controlled

bio-nano interface could suppress the molecular vibration of surface groups on

the protein and graphene. The intermolecular coupling of interlayer water would
be relaxed by the relative motion of protein upon graphene due to the
interaction between water and protein surface. This effect reduced the
hindrance of the interlayer water against the assembly of protein on graphene,
resulting an appropriate adsorption status of protein on graphene with a deep
free energy trap. Thereby, the confinement and the relative sliding between
protein and graphene, the coupling of protein and water, and the interaction
between graphene and water all have involved in the modulation of behaviors of
water molecules within the bio-nano interface, governing the hindrance of
interlayer water against the protein assembly on hydrophobic graphene. These
results provide a deep insight into the fundamental mechanism of protein

  times for any irrational rotation",,,,,"math.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We construct an increasing sequence of natural numbers
$(m_n)_{n=1}^{+\infty}$ with the property that $(m_n \th [1])_{n\geq 1}$ is
dense in $\T$ for any $\th \in \R\setminus \Q$, and a continuous measure on the
circle $\mu$ such that $\lim_{n\to
+\infty}\int_{\T}\|m_n\theta\|d\mu(\theta)=0$. Moreover, for every fixed $k\in
\N$, the set $\{n\in \N:\,k\nmid m_n \}$ is infinite.
  This is a sufficient condition for the existence of a rigid, weakly mixing
dynamical system whose rigidity time is not a rigidity time for any system with
a discrete part in its spectrum.

performance of AOMDV multipath routing protocol. This routing protocol in ad
hoc network has been analyzed with random way point mobility model only. This
is not sufficient to evaluate the behavior of a routing protocol. Therefore, in
this paper, we have considered Random waypoint, Random Direction and
Probabilistic Random Walk mobility Model for performance analysis of AOMDV
protocol. The result reveals that packet delivery ratio decreases with the
increasing node mobility for all mobility models. Also, average end-to-end
delay is also vary with varying node speed, initially upto 20 nodes in all
mobility models delay is minimum.

convergence of a series are discussed in the light of historical and
epistemological contexts. We show that some divergent series appearing in the
context of renormalization methods cannot be assigned finite values in a form
consistent with Hardy's axioms without at the same time equating one to zero,
thus destroying the mathematical building. We show that if the replacements for
the concept of sum of a series are required to be associative, to be invariant
under finite permutations of the terms and dilution, further restrictions
emerge. We finally discuss the epistemological costs of accepting these
practices in the name of instrumentalism.

intensity distribution of a source at the observation wavelength. Because of
rapid perturbations caused by atmospheric turbulence, the phases of the complex
Fourier samples (visibilities) cannot be directly exploited. Consequently,
specific image reconstruction methods have been devised in the last few
decades. Modern polychromatic optical interferometric instruments are now
paving the way to multiwavelength imaging. This paper is devoted to the
derivation of a spatio-spectral (3D) image reconstruction algorithm, coined
PAINTER (Polychromatic opticAl INTErferometric Reconstruction software). The
algorithm relies on an iterative process, which alternates estimation of
polychromatic images and of complex visibilities. The complex visibilities are
not only estimated from squared moduli and closure phases, but also
differential phases, which helps to better constrain the polychromatic
reconstruction. Simulations on synthetic data illustrate the efficiency of the
algorithm and in particular the relevance of injecting a differential phases
model in the reconstruction.

diffeomorphism symmetry, unitarity, and locality. Local observables are
compatible with diffeomorphism symmetry in the presence of diff anomalies,
which modify the symmetry algebra upon quantization. We describe the
generalization of the Virasoro extension to the diffeomorphism algebra in
several dimensions, and its off-shell representations. These anomalies can not
arise in QFT, because the Virasoro-like cocycles are functionals of the
observer's spacetime trajectory, which is not present in QFT. Possible
implications for physics are discussed.
