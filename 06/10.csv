as type Ia supernovae in single degenerate binaries, with magnitudes and color

probably symbiotic binaries undergoing mass transfer at a very high rate. There
is a candidate accreting white dwarf binary in the error circle of one of the
persistent sources, r3-8. In the spatial error circle of the best studied SSS
in M31, r2-12, no red giants or AGB stars are sufficiently luminous in the

217.7 s period, and we measured an upper limit on its derivative, 0.82 x

accreting at high rate in a binary with a few-hours orbital period. However,
there is no luminous counterpart with color indexes typical of an accretion
disk irradiated by a hot central source. Adopting a semi-empirical
relationship, the upper limit for the disk optical luminosity implies an upper
limit of only 169 minutes for the orbital period of the white dwarf binary.

We perform numerical computations of scale factors, and evaluate differences

approximation (QSSA) utilizes timescale separation to project models of
biochemical networks onto lower-dimensional slow manifolds. As a result, fast
elementary reactions are not modeled explicitly, and their effect is captured
by non-elementary reaction rate functions (e.g. Hill functions). The accuracy
of the QSSA applied to deterministic systems depends on how well timescales are
separated. Recently, it has been proposed to use the non-elementary rate
functions obtained via the deterministic QSSA to define propensity functions in
stochastic simulations of biochemical networks. In this approach, termed the
stochastic QSSA, fast reactions that are part of non-elementary reactions are
not simulated, greatly reducing computation time. However, it is unclear when
the stochastic QSSA provides an accurate approximation of the original
stochastic simulation. We show that, unlike the deterministic QSSA, the
validity of the stochastic QSSA does not follow from timescale separation
alone, but also depends on the sensitivity of the non-elementary reaction rate
functions to changes in the slow species. The stochastic QSSA becomes more
accurate when this sensitivity is small. Different types of QSSAs result in
non-elementary functions with different sensitivities, and the total QSSA
results in less sensitive functions than the standard or the pre-factor QSSA.
We prove that, as a result, the stochastic QSSA becomes more accurate when
non-elementary reaction functions are obtained using the total QSSA. Our work
provides a novel condition for the validity of the QSSA in stochastic
simulations of biochemical reaction networks with disparate timescales.

discretization that is more tightly connected with the invariant density of the

on this simplicial complex that we call the witness map. We obtain conditions
under which this witness map gives an outer approximation of the dynamics, and

for optomechanics: it combines low mass density, large tensile modulus, and low

reflects even less, thereby inadequate to generate large optical forces needed
in optomechanics. Here, we numerically show that a single-layer graphene sheet
is sufficient to produce strong optical forces under terahertz or infrared
illumination. For a system as simple as graphene suspended atop a uniform
substrate, high reflectivity from the substrate is crucial in creating a
standing-wave pattern, leading to a strong optical force on graphene. This
force is readily tunable in amplitude and direction by adjusting the suspension
height. In particular, repellent optical forces can levitate graphene to a
series of stable equilibrium heights above the substrate. One of the key
parameters to maximize the optical force is the excitation frequency: peak
forces are found near the scattering frequency of free carriers in graphene.

straightforward from morphology alone. Using deep HST/ACS data, we have derived
further constraints in the form of quantitative star formation histories (SFHs)
for 14 inner halo fields which sample diverse substructures. In agreement with
our previous analysis of colour-magnitude diagram morphologies, we find the
resultant behaviours can be broadly separated into two categories. The SFHs of
'disc-like' fields indicate that most of their mass has formed since z~1, with
one quarter of the mass formed in the last 5 Gyr. We find 'stream-like' fields
to be on average 1.5 Gyr older, with <10 percent of their stellar mass formed
within the last 5 Gyr. These fields are also characterised by an
age--metallicity relation showing rapid chemical enrichment to solar
metallicity by z=1, suggestive of an early-type progenitor. We confirm a
significant burst of star formation 2 Gyr ago, discovered in our previous work,
in all the fields studied here. The presence of these young stars in our most

acoustic phonons, having extremely long lifetimes in superfluid $^4$He, with
optical photons in the medium placed in a suitable electromagnetic cavity. The
acoustic nonlinearity in the fluid motion is included to consider processes
beyond the usual linear process involving absorption or emission of one phonon
at a time. We first apply our formulation to the simplest one-phonon process
involving the usual resonant anti-Stokes upconversion of an incident optical
mode. However, when the allowed optical cavity modes are such that there is no
single-phonon mode in the superfluid which can give rise to a resonant allowed
anti-Stokes mode, we must consider the possibility of two phonon upconversion.
For such a case, we show that the two step two phonon process could be
dominant. We present arguments for large two step process and negligible single
step two phonon contribution. The two step process also shows interesting
quantum interference among different transition pathways.

Moreover, the SU may leverage the primary feedback message to further increase
both its data rate and satisfy the PU QoS requirements. The proposed
cooperative schemes are designed such that the SU data rate is maximized under
the constraint that the PU average queueing delay is maintained less than the
average queueing delay in case of non-cooperative PU. In addition, the proposed
schemes guarantee the stability of the PU queue and maintain the average energy
emitted by the SU below a certain value. The proposed schemes also provide more
robust and potentially continuous service for SUs compared to the conventional
practice in cognitive networks where SUs transmit in the spectrum holes and
silence sessions of the PUs. We include primary source burstiness, sensing
errors, and feedback decoding errors to the analysis of our proposed
cooperative schemes. The optimization problems are solved offline and require a
simple 2-dimensional grid-based search over the optimization variables.
Numerical results show the beneficial gains of the cooperative schemes in terms
of SU data rate and PU throughput, average PU queueing delay, and average PU
energy savings.

the anisotropic Heisenberg (XXZ) spin-1/2 chain for periodic (or twisted)
boundary conditions and for a set of commensurate anisotropies densely covering
the entire easy plane interaction regime. All local conserved operators follow
from the standard (Hermitian) transfer operator in fundamental representation
(with auxiliary spin s=1/2), and are all even with respect to a spin flip
operation. However, the quasilocal family is generated by differentiation of a

quasilocal operators are not strictly vanishing but result in operators
localized near the boundaries of the chain. We show that a simple modification
of the non-Hermitian transfer operator results in exactly conserved, but still
quasilocal operators for periodic or generally twisted boundary conditions. As
an application, we demonstrate that implementing the new exactly conserved
operator family for estimating the high-temperature spin Drude weight results,
in the thermodynamic limit, in exactly the same lower bound as for almost
conserved family and open boundaries. Under the assumption that the bound is
saturating (suggested by agreement with previous thermodynamic Bethe ansatz

More precisely the solutions are approximated by their projections on finite

uniform in time and in the control, if this control has bounded variation with
a priori bounded total variation. Hence if these finite dimensional systems are
controllable with a fixed bound on the total variation of the control then the

that we can build solutions for low regular controls such as bounded variation

principle of $c^*$ reduces the computation to that of a principal eigenvalue

space-time periodic coefficients and small diffusion. To solve the advection
dominated time-dependent eigenvalue problem efficiently over large time, a

1.5 \times 10^{-5}$. However, the deuterium fractionation is in fact found to
be enhanced, to different degrees, in cold, dark cores, hot cores around
massive star forming regions, lukewarm cores, and warm cores ({\it hereafter},
hot corinos) around low-mass star forming regions. In this paper, we
investigate the overall differences in the deuterium chemistry between hot
cores and hot corinos. We have modelled the chemistry of dense gas around
low-mass and massive star forming regions using a gas-grain chemical model. We
investigate the influence of varying the core density, the depletion efficiency
of gaseous species on to dust grains, the collapse mode and the final mass of
the protostar on the chemical evolution of star forming regions. We find that
the deuterium chemistry is, in general, most sensitive to variations of the
depletion efficiency on to grain surfaces, in agreement with observations. In
addition, the results showed that the chemistry is more sensitive to changes in
the final density of the collapsing core in hot cores than in hot corinos.
Finally, we find that ratios of deuterated sulphur bearing species in dense gas
around hot cores and corinos may be good evolutionary indicators in a similar
way as their non deuterated counterparts.

evolution of the hot core and of the surrounding outflows and shocked gas (the

using the time-dependent gas-grain model UCL_CHEM and considering two different
phase calculations. Phase I starts with the collapsing cloud and the depletion
of atoms and molecules onto grain surfaces. Phase II starts when a central
protostar is formed and the evaporation from grains takes place. We show how
the gas density, the gas depletion efficiency, the initial sulphur abundance,
the shocked gas temperature and the different chemical paths on the grains
leading to different reservoirs of sulphur on the mantles affect
sulphur-bearing molecules at different evolutionary stages. We also compare the
predicted column densities with those inferred from observations of the species
SO, SO2, CS, OCS, H2S and H2CS. The models that reproduce the observations of
the largest number of sulphur-bearing species are those with an initial sulphur
abundance of 0.1 times the sulphur solar abundance and a density of at least
n_H=5x10^6 cm^-3 in the shocked gas region. We conclude that most of the
sulphur atoms were ionised during Phase I, consistent with an inhomogeneous and
clumpy region where the UV interstellar radiation penetrates leading to sulphur
ionisation. We also conclude that the main sulphur reservoir on the ice mantles
was H2S. In addition, we deduce that a chemical transition currently takes

method of estimating 3D human poses from a single image, which works in
conjunction with an existing 2D pose/joint detector. 3D pose estimation is
challenging because multiple 3D poses may correspond to the same 2D pose after
projection due to the lack of depth information. Moreover, current 2D pose
estimators are usually inaccurate which may cause errors in the 3D estimation.
We address the challenges in three ways: (i) We represent a 3D pose as a linear
combination of a sparse set of bases learned from 3D human skeletons. (ii) We
enforce limb length constraints to eliminate anthropomorphically implausible
skeletons. (iii) We estimate a 3D pose by minimizing the $L_1$-norm error
between the projection of the 3D pose and the corresponding 2D detection. The
$L_1$-norm loss term is robust to inaccurate 2D joint estimations. We use the
alternating direction method (ADM) to solve the optimization problem
efficiently. Our approach outperforms the state-of-the-arts on three benchmark

arrested, seem to lie at opposite ends of the spectrum in nonequilibrium
systems. In spite of this, both classes of systems exhibit a multitude of
stable states that are dynamically isolated from one another. While this
defining characteristic is held in common, its origin is different in each
case: for active systems, the irreversible driving forces can produce
dynamically frozen states, while glassy systems vitrify when they get
kinetically trapped on a rugged free energy landscape. In a mixture of active
and glassy particles, the interplay between these two tendencies leads to novel
phenomenology. We demonstrate this with a spin glass model that we generalize
to include an active component. In the absence of a ferromagnetic bias, we find
that the spin glass transition temperature depresses with the active fraction,
consistent with what has been observed for fully active glassy systems. When a
bias does exist, however, a new type of transition becomes possible: the system
can be cooled out of the glassy phase. This unusual phenomenon, known as
reentrance, has been observed before in a limited number of colloidal and
micellar systems, but it has not yet been observed in active glass mixtures.
Using low order perturbation theory, we study the origin of this reentrance
and, based on the physical picture that results, suggest how our predictions
might be measured experimentally.

confirming the young age of G1.9+0.3, and implying a significant deceleration
of the blast wave. The synchrotron-dominated X-ray emission brightens at a rate
of 1.9% +/- 0.4% per yr. We identify bright outer and inner rims with the blast
wave and reverse shock, respectively. Sharp density gradients in either ejecta
or ambient medium are required to produce the sudden deceleration of the
reverse shock or the blast wave implied by the large spread in expansion ages.
The blast wave could have been decelerated recently by an encounter with a
modest density discontinuity in the ambient medium, such as found at a wind
termination shock, requiring strong mass loss in the progenitor. Alternatively,
the reverse shock might have encountered an order-of-magnitude density
discontinuity within the ejecta, such as found in pulsating delayed-detonation
Type Ia models. We demonstrate that the blast wave is much more decelerated
than the reverse shock in these models for remnants at ages similar to
G1.9+0.3. Similar effects may also be produced by dense shells possibly
associated with high-velocity features in Type Ia spectra. Accounting for the
asymmetry of G1.9+0.3 will require more realistic 3D Type Ia models.

area of 1,500 square meters. The cylinders are stationary with no moving parts,
and form a transit instrument with an instantaneous field of view of
$\sim$100\,degrees by 1-2\,degrees. Each CHIME Pathfinder cylinder has a
feedline with 64 dual polarization feeds placed every $\sim$30\,cm which
Nyquist sample the north-south sky over much of the frequency band. The signals
from each dual-polarization feed are independently amplified, filtered to
400-800\,MHz, and directly sampled at 800\,MSps using 8 bits. The correlator is

in their network. Asking villagers in rural Indian villages to name good seeds
for diffusion, we find that they accurately nominate those who are central

  Version of Carath\'{e}odory's Theorem","28 pages; added references and extensions",,,,"cs.GT cs.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We present algorithmic applications of an approximate version of
Carath\'{e}odory's theorem. The theorem states that given a set of vectors $X$
in $\mathbb{R}^d$, for every vector in the convex hull of $X$ there exists an
$\varepsilon$-close (under the $p$-norm distance, for $2\leq p < \infty$)
vector that can be expressed as a convex combination of at most $b$ vectors of
$X$, where the bound $b$ depends on $\varepsilon$ and the norm $p$ and is
independent of the dimension $d$. This theorem can be derived by instantiating
Maurey's lemma, early references to which can be found in the work of Pisier
(1981) and Carl (1985). However, in this paper we present a self-contained
proof of this result.
  Using this theorem we establish that in a bimatrix game with $ n \times n$
payoff matrices $A, B$, if the number of non-zero entries in any column of
$A+B$ is at most $s$ then an $\varepsilon$-Nash equilibrium of the game can be
computed in time $n^{O\left(\frac{\log s }{\varepsilon^2}\right)}$. This, in
particular, gives us a polynomial-time approximation scheme for Nash
equilibrium in games with fixed column sparsity $s$. Moreover, for arbitrary
bimatrix games---since $s$ can be at most $n$---the running time of our
algorithm matches the best-known upper bound, which was obtained by Lipton,
Markakis, and Mehta (2003).
  The approximate Carath\'{e}odory's theorem also leads to an additive
approximation algorithm for the normalized densest $k$-subgraph problem. Given
a graph with $n$ vertices and maximum degree $d$, the developed algorithm
determines a subgraph with exactly $k$ vertices with normalized density within
$\varepsilon$ (in the additive sense) of the optimal in time $n^{O\left(
\frac{\log d}{\varepsilon^2}\right)}$. Additionally, we show that a similar
approximation result can be achieved for the problem of finding a $k \times
k$-bipartite subgraph of maximum normalized density.

attracted growing interest. Yet, so far nobody has estimated the conversion
probability $\gamma \to a$ as carefully as allowed by present-day knowledge.
Our aim is to fill this gap. We first remark that AGN that can be detected
above 100 GeV are blazars, namely AGN with jets, with one of them pointing
towards us. Moreover, blazars fall into two well defined classes: BL Lac
objects (BL Lacs) and Flat Spectrum Radio Quasars (FSRQs), with drastically
different properties. In this Letter we report a preliminary evaluation of the
$\gamma \to a$ conversion probability inside these two classes of blazars. Our
findings are surprising. Indeed, while in the case of BL Lacs the conversion
probability turns out to be totally unpredictable due to the strong dependence
on the values of the somewhat uncertain position of the emission region along
the jet and strength of the magnetic field therein, for FSRQs we are able to
make a clear-cut prediction. Our results are of paramount importance in view of
the planned very-high-energy photon detectors like the CTA, HAWK, GAMMA-400 and
HISCORE.

the usual decoherence model. We here investigate the reconstruction of a
Gaussian state (single mode and two modes) by coarse-grained homodyne
measurements. To this aim, we employ two methods, the direct reconstruction of
the covariance matrix and the maximum likelihood estimation (MLE),
respectively, and examine the reconstructed state under each scheme compared to
the state interacting with a Gaussian (squeezed thermal) reservoir. We clearly
demonstrate that the coarse-graining model, though applied equally to all
quadrature amplitudes, is not compatible with the decoherence model by a
thermal (phase-insensitive) reservoir. Furthermore, we compare the performance
of the direct reconstruction and the MLE methods by investigating the fidelity
and the nonclassicality of the reconstructed states and show that the MLE
method can generally yield a more reliable reconstruction, particularly without
information on a reference frame (phase of input state).

galaxies. They have very low surface brightness, which makes it difficult to
identify and study them outside of the Local Group. We used a low surface
brightness-optimized telescope, the Dragonfly Telephoto Array, to search for
dwarf galaxies in the field of the massive spiral galaxy M101. We identify
seven large, low surface brightness objects in this field, with effective radii
of \(10 - 30\) arcseconds and central surface brightnesses of \(\mu_{g} \sim
25.5 - 27.5\) mag arcsec\(^{-2}\). Given their large apparent sizes and low
surface brightnesses, these objects would likely be missed by standard galaxy
searches in deep fields. Assuming the galaxies are dwarf satellites of M101,
their absolute magnitudes are in the range \(-11.6 \lesssim M_{V} \lesssim
-9.3\) and their effective radii are \(350\) pc \(-\) \(1.3\) kpc. Their radial
surface brightness profiles are well fit by Sersic profiles with a very low
Sersic index (\(n \sim 0.3 - 0.7\)). The properties of the sample are similar
to those of well-studied dwarf galaxies in the Local Group, such as Sextans I
and Phoenix. Distance measurements are required to determine whether these
galaxies are in fact associated with M101 or are in its foreground or
background.

monitoring the Galactic Bulge to detect exoplanets via gravitational

preferences for four target fields located in the central Bulge and an exposure
time of t_{exp} = 120s, leading to the detection of ~2,200 microlensing events
per year. We estimate the planet detection rates for planets with mass and
separation across the ranges 0.1 <= M_{p}/M_{Earth} <= 1000 and 0.4 <= a/AU <=
16, respectively. Normalizing these rates to the cool-planet mass function of
Cassan (2012), we predict KMTNet will be approximately uniformly sensitive to
planets with mass 5 <= M_{p}/M_{Earth} <= 1000 and will detect ~20 planets per
year per dex in mass across that range. For lower-mass planets with mass 0.1 <=
M_{p}/M_{Earth} < 5, we predict KMTNet will detect ~10 planets per year. We
also compute the yields KMTNet will obtain for free-floating planets (FFPs) and
predict KMTNet will detect ~1 Earth-mass FFP per year, assuming an underlying
population of one such planet per star in the Galaxy. Lastly, we investigate
the dependence of these detection rates on the number of observatories, the
photometric precision limit, and optimistic assumptions regarding seeing,
throughput, and flux measurement uncertainties.

disk surrounding binary supermassive black holes on a circular orbit. Such a
circumbinary disk is subject to not only tidal torques due to the binary
gravitational potential but also radiative torques due to radiation emitted
from an accretion disk around each black hole. We find that a circumbinary disk
initially aligned with the binary orbital plane is unstable to radiation-driven
warping beyond the marginally stable warping radius, which is sensitive to both
the ratio of vertical to horizontal shear viscosities and the mass-to-energy
conversion efficiency. As expected, the tidal torques give no contribution to
the growth of warping modes but tend to align the circumbinary disk with the
orbital plane. Since the tidal torques can suppress the warping modes in the
inner part of circumbinary disk, the circumbinary disk starts to be warped at
radii larger than the marginally stable warping radius. If the warping radius
is of the order of 0.1 pc, a resultant semi-major axis is estimated to be of
the order of 10^-2 pc to 10^-4 pc for 10^7 Msun black hole. We also discuss the
possibility that the central objects of observed warped maser disks in active

accretion disks around the individual black holes and one circumbinary disk
surrounding them.

fast, precise C++ spectrum generator for any SUSY model specified by the user.
The generated code is designed with both speed and modularity in mind, making
it easy to adapt and extend with new features. The model is specified by
supplying the superpotential, gauge structure and particle content in a SARAH
model file; specific boundary conditions e.g. at the GUT, weak or intermediate
scales are defined in a separate FlexibleSUSY model file. From these model
files, FlexibleSUSY generates C++ code for self-energies, tadpole corrections,
renormalization group equations (RGEs) and electroweak symmetry breaking (EWSB)
conditions and combines them with numerical routines for solving the RGEs and
EWSB conditions simultaneously. The resulting spectrum generator is then able
to solve for the spectrum of the model, including loop-corrected pole masses,
consistent with user specified boundary conditions. The modular structure of
the generated code allows for individual components to be replaced with an
alternative if available. FlexibleSUSY has been carefully designed to grow as
alternative solvers and calculators are added. Predefined models include the
MSSM, NMSSM, E$_6$SSM, USSM, R-symmetric models and models with right-handed

study the role of multiplicity in relation to star formation. Loose nearby
associations provide us with a great sample of close ($<$150 pc) Pre-Main
Sequence (PMS) stars across the very important age range ($\approx$5-70 Myr) to
conduct such research.
  Aims: We characterize the short period multiplicity fraction of the SACY
(Search for Associations Containing Young stars) accounting for any
identifiable bias in our techniques and present the role of multiplicity
fractions of the SACY sample in the context of star formation.
  Methods: Using the cross-correlation technique we identified double-lined
spectroscopic systems (SB2), in addition to this we computed Radial Velocity
(RV) values for our subsample of SACY targets using several epochs of FEROS and
UVES data. These values were used to revise the membership of each association
then combined with archival data to determine significant RV variations across
different data epochs characteristic of multiplicity; single-lined multiple
systems (SB1).
  Results: We identified 7 new multiple systems (SB1s: 5, SB2s: 2). We find no
significant difference between the short period multiplicity fraction
($F_\mathrm{m}$) of the SACY sample and that of nearby star forming regions
($\approx$1-2 Myr) and the field ($F_\mathrm{m}\leq$10%) both as a function of
age and as a function of primary mass, $M_1$, in the ranges $P$ [1:200 day] and
$M_2$ [0.08 $M_{\odot}$-$ M_1$].
  Conclusions: Our results are consistent with the picture of universal star
formation, when compared to the field and nearby star forming regions (SFRs).
We comment on the implications of the relationship between increasing
multiplicity fraction with primary mass, within the close companion range, in
relation to star formation.

appeal to a model by Davies, Miller & Bellovary who considered the case of the
dynamical collapse of a dense cluster of stellar black holes subjected to an
inflow of gas. Here, we explore this case in a broad cosmological context. The
working hypotheses are that (i) nuclear star clusters form at high redshifts in
pre-galactic discs hosted in dark matter halos, providing a suitable
environment for the formation of stellar black holes in their cores, (ii) major
central inflows of gas occur onto these clusters due to instabilities seeded in
the growing discs and/or to mergers with other gas-rich halos, and that (iii)
following the inflow, stellar black holes in the core avoid ejection due to the
steepening to the potential well, leading to core collapse and the formation of
a massive seed of $<~ 1000\, \rm M_\odot$. We simulate a cosmological box
tracing the build up of the dark matter halos and there embedded baryons, and
explore cluster evolution with a semi-analytical model. We show that this route
is feasible, peaks at redshifts $z <~ 10$ and occurs in concomitance with the
formation of seeds from other channels. The channel is competitive relative to
others, and is independent of the metal content of the parent cluster. This
mechanism of gas driven core collapse requires inflows with masses at least ten
times larger than the mass of the parent star cluster, occurring on timescales
shorter than the evaporation/ejection time of the stellar black holes from the
core. In this respect, the results provide upper limit to the frequency of this

$(1+z)^{3.8\pm0.9}$, in agreement with earlier studies and with dark matter
halo merger rates. Separating the sample into star-forming and quiescent

strongly redshift, $(1+z)^{4.5\pm1.3}$, while the merger rate for quiescent

sample to galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts from zCOSMOS, we find that the

our sample with more widely separated pairs, we find that $8\pm5\%$ of star
formation and $20\pm8\%$ of AGN activity is triggered by close encounters (<143
kpc) or mergers, once more suggesting that major mergers are not the only
channels for star formation and black hole growth. (abridged)

the fermions of the Standard Model (SM), including neutrinos. Due to the
exponential sensitivity on bulk fermion masses, a small breaking of the
symmetry can be greatly enhanced and produce seemingly un-symmetric
hierarchical masses and small mixing angles among the charged fermion
zero-modes (SM quarks and charged leptons) and wash-out the obvious effects of
the symmetry. With the Higgs field leaking into the bulk, and Dirac neutrinos
sufficiently localized towards the UV boundary, the neutrino mass hierarchy and
flavor structure will still be largely dominated by the fundamental flavor
structure. The neutrino sector would then reflect the fundamental flavor
structure, whereas the quark sector would probe the effects of the flavor
symmetry breaking sector. As an example, we explore these features in the
context of a family permutation symmetry imposed in both quark and lepton
sectors.

We develop a new theoretical model based on the analysis of the electron
transport (continuity) equation, carried out in the Fourier domain. The
continuity equation includes electron cooling and escape, and a derivation of
the emission properties includes light travel time effects associated with a
radiating blob in a relativistic jet. The model successfully reproduces the
general shapes of the observed PSDs and predicts specific PSD and time lag
behaviors associated with variability in the synchrotron, synchrotron
self-Compton (SSC), and external Compton (EC) emission components, from sub-mm

flat-spectrum radio quasars (FSRQs), where there are hints that some of the

that the PM limit of massive gravity also lacks the PM gauge symmetry.

more frequent interactions between the planetesimals and the ice giants Uranus

for the tidal heating rate in a tidally perturbed homogeneous sphere. We
compared it with the formulae used in the literature, and pointed out the
differences. Using this result, we now present three case studies - Mercury,
Kepler-10b, and a triaxial Io. A very sharp frequency-dependence of k2/Q near
spin-orbit resonances yields a similarly sharp dependence of k2/Q on the spin
rate. This indicates that physical libration may play a major role in tidal
heating of synchronously rotating bodies. The magnitude of libration in the
spin rate being defined by the planet's triaxiality, the latter should be a
factor determining the dissipation rate. Other parameters equal, a
synchronously rotating body with a stronger triaxiality should generate more
heat than a similar body of a more symmetrical shape. Further in the paper, we
discuss scenarios where initially triaxial objects melt and lose their
triaxiality. Thereafter, dissipation in them becomes less intensive; so the
bodies freeze. The tidal bulge becomes a new permanent figure, with a new
triaxiality lower than the original. In the paper, we also derive simplified,
approximate expressions for dissipation rate in a rocky planet of the Maxwell
rheology, with a not too small Maxwell time. The three expressions derived
pertain to the cases of a synchronous spin, a 3:2 resonance, and a nonresonant
rotation; so they can be applied to most close-in super-Earth exoplanets
detected thus far. In such bodies, the rate of tidal heating outside of
synchronous rotation is weakly dependent on the eccentricity and obliquity,
provided both these parameters are small or moderate. According to our
calculation, Kepler-10b could hardly survive the great amount of tidal heating
without being synchronised, circularised and also reshaped through a complete
or partial melt-down.

induces $n \rightarrow n$ molecular interaction processes with $n \geq 4$,
where $n$ is the number of molecules participating of type $U$ or $V$. The
momentum dependences of the reaction rates are driven by the fact that the
autocatalytic reaction (inelastic scattering) is renormalized through the
existence of an arbitrary number of intermediate elastic scatterings, which can
also be interpreted as the creation and subsequent decay of a three body
composite state $\sigma = \phi_u \phi_v^2$, where $\phi_i$ corresponds to the
fields representing the densities of $U$ and $V$. Finally, we discuss the
difference between representing $\sigma$ as a composite or an elementary
particle (molecule) with its own kinetic parameters. In one dimension we find
that while they show markedly different behavior in the short spatio-temporal
scale, high momentum (UV) limit, they are formally equivalent in the large
spatio-temporal scale, low momentum (IR) regime. On the other hand in two
dimensions and greater, due to the effects of fluctuations, there is no way to
experimentally distinguish between a fundamental and composite $\sigma$. Thus
in this regime $\sigma$ behave as an entity unto itself suggesting that it can
be effectively treated as an independent chemical species.

of in-situ measurements. It is possible, however, to combine remote
observations with data-driven models in order to deduce coronal shock
properties relevant to the local acceleration of SEPs and their heliospheric
connectivity to near-Earth space. We present such novel analysis applied to the

the eruption-driven, dome-like shock wave observed by the Atmospheric Imaging
Assembly (AIA) EUV telescopes on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory

emission measure modeling. We apply a new method combining a geometric model of
the shock front with a potential field source surface model to estimate
time-dependent field-to-shock angles and heliospheric connectivity during shock
passage in the low corona. We find that the shock was weak, with an initial
speed of ~450 km/s. It was initially mostly quasi-parallel, but significant
portion of it turned quasi-perpendicular later in the event. There was good
magnetic connectivity to near-Earth space towards the end of the event as
observed by the AIA instrument. The methods used in this analysis hold a
significant potential for early characterization of coronal shock waves and
forecasting of SEP spectra based on remote observations.

themselves away from thermal aggressions, we propose a macroscopic experiment
to study the stability of a slender beam extruded in a highly viscous fluid.
Piano wires were extruded axially at constant speed in a tank filled with corn
syrup. The force necessary to extrude the wire was measured to increase
linearly at first until the compressive viscous force causes the wire to
buckle. A numerical model, coupling a lengthening elastica formulation with
resistive force theory, predicts a similar behaviour. The model is used to
study the dynamics at large time when the beam is highly deformed. It is found
that at large time, a large deformation regime exists in which the force
necessary to extrude the beam at constant speed becomes constant and
length-independent. With a proper dimensional analysis, the beam can be shown
to buckle at a critical length based on the extrusion speed, the bending
rigidity and the dynamic viscosity of the fluid. Hypothesising that the
trichocysts of paramercies must be sized to maximise their thrust per unit
volume as well as avoid buckling instabilities, we predict that their bending
rigidity must be about $3\times 10^{-9}~\mathrm{N\cdot \mu m^2}$. The
verification of this prediction is left for future work.

investigate the possibility of a Wiener filtering scheme to subtract correlated
noise from Advanced LIGO searches, and estimate the required specifications. We
also consider the possibility that residual correlated noise remains following
subtraction, and we devise an optimal strategy for measuring astronomical
parameters in the presence of correlated noise. Using this new formalism, we
estimate the loss of sensitivity for a broadband, isotropic stochastic
background search using 1 yr of LIGO data at design sensitivity. Given our
current noise budget, the uncertainty with which LIGO can estimate energy

$\rho_{s}(T)\equiv(\lambda(0)/\lambda(T))^{2}$ quantitatively described by a
self-consistent $\gamma$-model with two nodeless isotropic superconducting

superconducting dome at $x$=0.16, the low-temperature behavior of
$\Delta\lambda(T)$ becomes non-exponential and best described by the power-law
$\Delta\lambda(T)\propto T^{2}$, characteristic of strongly anisotropic gaps.
The change between the two regimes happens within the range of coexisting
magnetic/nematic order and superconductivity, $x<0.25$, and is accompanied by a
rapid rise in the absolute value of $\Delta\lambda(T)$ with underdoping. This
effect, characteristic of the competition between superconductivity and other
ordered states, is very similar to but of significantly smaller magnitude than
what is observed in the electron-doped Ba(Fe$_{1-x}$Co$_{x}$)$_{2}$As$_{2}$

and magnetic/nematic order in hole-doped compounds is weaker than in
electron-doped compounds, and that the anisotropy of the superconducting state
in the underdoped iron pnictides is a consequence of the anisotropic changes in
the pairing interaction and in the gap function promoted by both magnetic and

congruence. The distillation process unveils that abstract machines in fact
implement weak linear head reduction, a notion of evaluation having a central
role in the theory of linear logic. We show that such a pattern applies
uniformly in call-by-name, call-by-value, and call-by-need, catching many
machines in the literature. We start by distilling the KAM, the CEK, and the
ZINC, and then provide simplified versions of the SECD, the lazy KAM, and
Sestoft's machine. Along the way we also introduce some new machines with
global environments. Moreover, we show that distillation preserves the time
complexity of the executions, i.e. the LSC is a complexity-preserving
abstraction of abstract machines.

with a weak shock. EUV wave positions are correlated with positions from
simultaneous type II radio burst observations. We find good temporal and height
association between the two, suggesting that the waves may be the EUV

significant increases in proton fluxes at 1 AU, possibly related to how waves
propagate through the coronal magnetic field. Characterizing these coronal
transients will be key to connecting their properties with energetic particle
production close to the Sun.

surprising participation of multiple channels in the nominal tunneling regime.

cars, i.e.assigning every pixel within the car to one of the parts (e.g.body,

couples the landmarks to a hierarchy of segments. When modeling pairwise
relation between landmarks, this coupling enables our model to exploit the
local image contents in addition to spatial deformation, an aspect that most
existing graphical models ignore. In particular, our model enforces appearance
consistency between segments within the same part. Parsing the car, including
finding the optimal coupling between landmarks and segments in the hierarchy,
is performed by dynamic programming. We evaluate our method on a subset of
PASCAL VOC 2010 car images and on the car subset of 3D Object Category dataset

using the segment appearance consistency in terms of accuracy of part

the opposite behaviour and get fainter when their activity increases.
  We reproduce the observed photometric trends in stellar variations with a
model that treats stars as hypothetical Suns with coverage by magnetic features
different from that of the Sun.
  The presented model attributes the variability of stellar spectra to the
imbalance between the contributions from different components of the solar
atmosphere, such as dark starspots and bright faculae. A stellar spectrum is
calculated from spectra of the individual components, by weighting them with
corresponding disc area coverages. The latter are obtained by extrapolating the
solar dependences of spot and facular disc area coverages on chromospheric
activity to stars with different levels of mean chromospheric activity.
  We have found that the contribution by starspots to the variability increases
faster with chromospheric activity than the facular contribution. This causes
the transition from faculae-dominated variability and direct
activity--brightness correlation to spot-dominated variability and inverse
activity--brightness correlation with increasing chromospheric activity level.
We have shown that the regime of the variability also depends on the angle
between the stellar rotation axis and the line-of-sight and on the latitudinal
distribution of active regions on the stellar surface. Our model can be used as
a tool to extrapolate the observed photometric variability of the Sun to
Sun-like stars at different activity levels, which makes possible the direct
comparison between solar and stellar irradiance data.

study of eight nearby redbacks, using more than 100 observations obtained with

and outburst states. We find X-ray mode switching in the disk state of PSR
J1023+0038 and XSS J12270-4859, similar to what was found in the other redback

abundance in the Sun, which is much lower than the proto-solar nebula. This Li
problem has been debated for decades, and it has been ascribed either to planet
formation or to secular stellar depletion. In order to test the evolution of
Li, it is important to find solar twins in a range of ages. Also, the study of
stars similar to the Sun is relevant in relation to the signature of
terrestrial planet formation around the Sun. [Methods]. We acquired
high-resolution (R=110,000), high S/N (~300) ESO/VLT UVES spectra of several
solar twin candidates and the Sun (as reflected from the asteroid Juno). Among
the solar twin candidates we identify HIP 114328 as a solar twin and perform a
differential line-by-line abundance analysis of this star relative to the Sun.
[Results]. HIP 114328 has stellar parameters Teff = 5785+/-10 K, log g =
4.38+/-0.03, [Fe/H] = -0.022+/-0.009, and a microturbulent velocity 0.05+/-0.03
km/s higher than solar. The differential analysis shows that this star is
chemically very similar to the Sun. The refractory elements seem even slightly
more depleted than in the Sun, meaning that HIP 114328 may be as likely to form
terrestrial planets as the Sun. HIP 114328 is about 2 Gyr older than the Sun,
and is thus the second oldest solar twin analyzed at high precision. It has a
Li abundance of A(Li)NLTE <= 0.46, which is about 4 times lower than in the Sun
(A(Li)NLTE = 1.07 dex), but close to the oldest solar twin known, HIP 102152.
[Conclusions]. Based on the lower abundances of refractory elements when
compared to other solar twins, HIP 114328 seems an excellent candidate to host
rocky planets. The low Li abundance of this star is consistent with its old age
and fits very well the emerging Li-age relation among solar twins of different
ages.

properties of real-time path integrals on Lefschetz thimbles, we demonstrate
its computational method in a concrete way by solving three simple examples of
quantum mechanics. It is applied to quantum mechanics of a double-well
potential, and quantum tunneling is discussed. We identify all of the complex
saddle points of the classical action, and their properties are discussed in
detail. However a big theoretical difficulty turns out to appear in rewriting
the original path integral into a sum of path integrals on Lefschetz thimbles.
We discuss generality of that problem and mention its importance. Real-time
tunneling processes are shown to be described by those complex saddle points,
and thus semi-classical description of real-time quantum tunneling becomes
possible on solid ground if we could solve that problem.

supposed discrepancy--first, the most commonly accepted, is the suggestion of
the existence of large non-baryonic dark matter halo, and, second are theories
advocating some modification to the law of gravity. So far however, there is no
empirical evidence for either dark matter or modified gravity. Here we show
that a broad range of galaxy rotation curves can be explained solely in
accordance with Newton's law of gravity by modeling the distribution of
baryonic matter in a galaxy. We demonstrate that the expectation of Keplerian
fall-off is incorrect, and that a large number of likely galaxy mass
distribution profiles should in fact produce flat or accelerating rotation
curves similar to those observed in reality. We further support our theoretical
findings with the model fit of 47 rotation curves of real galaxies,
representing a broad range of galactic types and sizes, and achieving
correlation of expected and observed velocities of over 0.995 for all cases.
Our results make theories of exotic dark matter or modified gravity unnecessary

the essential features of Wigner's little groups dictating the internal
space-time symmetries of particles in the Lorentz-covariant world. The little
groups are the subgroups of the Lorentz group whose transformations leave the
four-momentum of a given particle invariant. It is shown that the damping modes
of the oscillator correspond to the little groups for massive and
imaginary-mass particles respectively. When the system makes the transition
from the oscillation to damping mode, it corresponds to the little group for

applying a $c$-axis magnetic field. On cooling below $T_c$, superconductivity
occupies the PM region and its volume fraction grows at the expense of the AFM

volume exclusion. At higher dopings, static antiferromagnetism and even
critical AFM fluctuations are completely suppressed by superconductivity. Thus
the phase diagram we establish contains two distinct types of phase separation

consequences of the extreme two-dimensionality of NaFeAs.

long-term evolution over 1.0 s after bounce, most of the computed models
exhibit neutrino-driven revival of the stalled bounce shock at $\sim$ 200 - 800

of expectations in previous one-dimensional (1D) studies, our results confirm
that the compactness parameter $\xi$ that characterizes the structure of the
progenitors is also a key in 2D to diagnose the properties of neutrino-driven
explosions. Models with high $\xi$ undergo high ram pressure from the accreting
matter onto the stalled shock, which affects the subsequent evolution of the
shock expansion and the mass of the protoneutron star under the influence of
neutrino-driven convection and the standing accretion-shock instability. We
show that the accretion luminosity becomes higher for models with high $\xi$,
which makes the growth rate of the diagnostic explosion energy higher and the
synthesized nickel mass bigger. We find that these explosion characteristics
tend to show a monotonic increase as a function of the compactness parameter
$\xi$.

and on the dark matter particle mass. We estimate limits from combined
observations of a sample of 15 dwarfs, for a variety of assumptions on the
dwarf black hole mass and on the dark matter density profile prior to adiabatic
contraction. We find that if black holes are indeed present in local dwarf
spheroidals, then, independent of assumptions, (i) the dark matter

quantitatively give an estimate of the community-like structure of the network.
  The central idea of permanence is based on the observation that the strength
of membership of a vertex to a community depends upon the following two
factors: (i) the distribution of external connectivity of the vertex to
individual communities and not the total external connectivity, and (ii) the
strength of its internal connectivity and not just the total internal edges.

provides (i) a more accurate estimate of a derived community structure to the

eigenfunctions. Transition to global chaos is accompanied by smearing of these
patterns; however, some of their traces survive on relatively long timescales.

properties. These nanostructured materials strongly attenuate light in a broad
wavelength interval ranged from 400 nm to 5 um but exhibit a narrow
transparency window centered at a given wavelength. The main elements are
nanorods and nano-crosses of variable sizes. The nanomaterial can be designed
as a solution, nanocomposite film, metastructure or aerosol. The principle of
the formation of the transparency window in the abroad extinction spectrum is
based on the narrow lines of longitudinal plasmons of single nanorods and
nanorod complexes. To realize the spectrum with a transmission window, we
design a nanocomposite material as a mixture of nanorods of different sizes.
Simultaneously, we exclude nanorods of certain length from the nanorod
ensemble. The width of the plasmonic transparency window is determined by the
intrinsic and radiative broadenings of the nanocrystal plasmons. We also
describe the effect of narrowing of the transparency window with increasing the
concentration of nanocrystals. Two well-established technologies can be used to
fabricate such nano- and metamaterials, the colloidal synthesis and
lithography. Nanocomposites proposed here can be used as optical materials and
coatings for shielding of electromagnetic radiation in a wide spectral interval
with a simultaneous possibility of communication using a narrow transparency
window.

Electroencephalographic (EEG) data is an important tool for non-invasive study

high-dimensional inverse problem that has an infinite number of solutions and
thus requires additional constraints to be considered to have a unique
solution. In the context of EEG source localization, we propose a novel
approach that is based on dividing the cerebral cortex of the brain into a
finite number of Functional Zones which correspond to unitary functional areas
in the brain. In this paper we investigate the use of Brodmanns areas as the
Functional Zones. This approach allows us to apply a sparsity constraint to
find a unique solution for the inverse EEG problem. Compared to previously
published algorithms which use different sparsity constraints to solve this
problem, the proposed method is potentially more consistent with the known
sparsity profile of the human brain activity and thus may be able to ensure
better localization. Numerical experiments are conducted on a realistic head

walk towards a target node in a network in the presence of traps. The bias is
represented as the probability $p$ of the particle to travel along the shortest
path to the target node. The efficiency of the transmission process is
expressed through the fraction $f_g$ of particles that succeed to reach the
target without being trapped. By relating $f_g$ with the number $S$ of nodes
visited before reaching the target, we firstly show that, for the unbiased
random walk, $f_g$ is inversely proportional to both the concentration $c$ of
traps and the size $N$ of the network. For the case of biased walks, a simple
approximation of $S$ provides an analytical solution that describes well the
behavior of $f_g$, especially for $p>0.5$. Also, it is shown that for a given
value of the bias $p$, when the concentration of traps is less than a threshold
value equal to the inverse of the Mean First Passage Time (MFPT) between two
randomly chosen nodes of the network, the efficiency of transmission is
unaffected by the presence of traps and almost all the particles arrive at the
target. As a consequence, for a given concentration of traps, we can estimate
the minimum bias that is needed to have unaffected transmission, especially in
the case of Random Regular (RR), Erd\H{o}s-R\'{e}nyi (ER) and Scale-Free (SF)
networks, where an exact expression (RR and ER) or an upper bound (SF) of the
MFPT is known analytically. We also study analytically and numerically, the
fraction $f_g$ of particles that reach the target on SF networks, where a
single trap is placed on the highest degree node. For the unbiased random walk,

contraction cases. This loss of regularity is interesting because it occurs
regardless of whether the less viscous fluid is displacing the more viscous
fluid, or vice versa. We show that small contracting bubbles are described to
leading order by a well-studied geometric flow rule. Exact solutions to this
asymptotic problem continue past the corner formation until the bubble
contracts to a point as a slit in the limit. Lastly, we consider the evolving
boundary with kinetic undercooling in a Saffman--Taylor channel geometry. The
boundary may either form corners in finite time, or evolve to a single long
finger travelling at constant speed, depending on the strength of kinetic
undercooling. We demonstrate these two different behaviours numerically. For
the travelling finger, we present results of a numerical solution method
similar to that used to demonstrate the selection of discrete fingers by
surface tension. With kinetic undercooling, a continuum of corner-free
travelling fingers exists for any finger width above a critical value, which
goes to zero as the kinetic undercooling vanishes. We have not been able to
compute the discrete family of analytic solutions, predicted by previous
asymptotic analysis, because the numerical scheme cannot distinguish between
solutions characterised by analytic fingers and those which are corner-free but

Physical Chemistry literature. In particular, biochemical cycles - the
building-blocks of biochemical systems - require a source of energy to
function. However, although fundamental, the role of chemical potential and
Gibb's free energy in the analysis of biochemical systems is often overlooked
leading to models which are physically impossible. The bond graph approach was
developed for modelling engineering systems where energy generation, storage
and transmission are fundamental. The method focuses on how power flows between
components and how energy is stored, transmitted or dissipated within
components. Based on early ideas of network thermodynamics, we have applied
this approach to biochemical systems to generate models which automatically
obey the laws of thermodynamics. We illustrate the method with examples of
biochemical cycles. We have found that thermodynamically compliant models of
simple biochemical cycles can easily be developed using this approach. In
particular, both stoichiometric information and simulation models can be
developed directly from the bond graph. Furthermore, model reduction and
approximation while retaining structural and thermodynamic properties is
facilitated. Because the bond graph approach is also modular and scaleable, we
believe that it provides a secure foundation for building thermodynamically
compliant models of large biochemical networks.

provides acceleration of the electrons to the energy which is sufficient to
explain the observed VHE pulsed $\gamma$-rays from Crab pulsar.

$n_{\rm b}$ an astronomical body of mass $M$ which, in turn, slowly revolves
around a distant object of mass $M^{'}$ with orbital frequency $n_{\rm

negligible with respect to both $n_{\rm b}$ and $n_{\rm b}^{'}$. General
expressions for the resulting Newtonian and post-Newtonian tidal orbital shifts
of $m$ are obtained. The future missions BepiColombo and JUICE to Mercury and
Ganymede, respectively, are considered in view of a possible detection. The
largest effects, of the order of $\approx 0.1-0.5$ milliarcseconds per year
(mas yr$^{-1}$), occur for the Ganymede orbiter of the JUICE mission. Although
future improvements in spacecraft tracking and orbit determination might,
perhaps, reach the required sensitivity, the systematic bias represented by the
other known orbital perturbations of both Newtonian and post-Newtonian origin
would be overwhelming. The realization of a dedicated artificial mini-planetary
system to be carried onboard and Earth-orbiting spacecraft is considered as
well. Post-Newtonian tidal precessions as large as $\approx 1-10^2$ mas
yr$^{-1}$ could be obtained, but the quite larger Newtonian tidal effects would
be a major source of systematic bias because of the present-day percent
uncertainty in the product of the Earth's mass times the Newtonian

transform this MINMAX problem into the problem of searching for the minimum

to achieve the distance by iteratively projecting onto the hyper-plane and the

vacuum by introducing a non-vanishing chromomagnetic field strength. This
happens because radiative corrections produce an effective action of the form
$f(F_{\mu\nu}^aF^{\mu\nu a})$ with $f'(y_0)=0$ for some $y_0\neq 0$. However, a
vacuum with a non zero field strength is not consistent with Poincare
Invariance (PI). Generalizing this type of effective action by introducing, in
the simplest way, a four index field strength
$\partial_{[\mu}A_{\nu\alpha\beta]}$, which can have an expectation value
without violating PI, we are lead to an effective action that can describe both
a confinement phase and a perturbative phase of the theory. In the unconfined
phase, the 4-index field strength does not introduce new degrees of freedom,
while in the confined phase both 4-index field strength and ordinary gauge
fields are not true degrees of freedom. The matching of these phases through
membranes that couple minimally to the 3-index potentials from which the

  and merging scenarios","Submitted paper (May 26th, 2014)",,,,"cs.NI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper we consider a Wireless Mesh Network (WMN) integrating SDN
principles. The Wireless Mesh Routers (WMR) are OpenFlow capable switches that
can be controlled by SDN controllers, according to the wmSDN (wireless mesh
SDN) architecture that we have introduced in a previous work. We consider the
issue of controller selection in a scenario with intermittent connectivity. We
assume that over time a single WMN can become split in two or more partitions
and that separate partitions can merge into a larger one. We assume that a set
of SDN controllers can potentially take control of the WMRs. At a given time
only one controller should be the master of a WMR and it should be the most
appropriate one according to some metric. We argue that the state of the art
solutions for ""master election"" among distributed controllers are not suitable
in a mesh networking environment, as they could easily be affected by
inconsistencies. We envisage a ""master selection"" approach which is under the
control of each WMR, and guarantees that at a given time only one controller
will be master of a WMR. We designed a specific master selection procedure
which is very simple in terms of the control logic to be executed in the WMR.
We have implemented the proposed solution and deployed it over a network
emulator (CORE) and over the combination of two physical wireless testbeds
(NITOS and wiLab.t).

particles in p-Pb and Pb-Pb collisions are presented. They help address the
question of whether there is evidence for global, flow-like, azimuthal
correlations in the p-Pb system. Comparisons are made to measurements from the
larger Pb-Pb system, where such evidence is established. In particular, the
second harmonic two-particle cumulants are found to decrease with multiplicity,
characteristic of a dominance of few-particle correlations in p-Pb collisions.
However, when a $|\Delta \eta|$ gap is placed to suppress such correlations,
the two-particle cumulants begin to rise at high-multiplicity, indicating the
presence of global azimuthal correlations. The Pb-Pb values are higher than the
p-Pb values at similar multiplicities. In both systems, the second harmonic
four-particle cumulants exhibit a transition from positive to negative values
when the multiplicity increases. The negative values allow for a measurement of
$v_{2}\{4\}$ to be made, which is found to be higher in Pb-Pb collisions at
similar multiplicities. The second harmonic six-particle cumulants are also
found to be higher in Pb-Pb collisions. In Pb-Pb collisions, we generally find
$v_{2}\{4\} \simeq v_{2}\{6\}\neq 0$ which is indicative of a Bessel-Gaussian
function for the $v_{2}$ distribution. For very high-multiplicity Pb-Pb
collisions, we observe that the four- and six-particle cumulants become
consistent with 0. Finally, third harmonic two-particle cumulants in p-Pb and
Pb-Pb are measured. These are found to be similar for overlapping
multiplicities, when a $|\Delta\eta| > 1.4$ gap is placed.

regime', where the effects of viscosity are negligible and the propagation of
the bridge front connecting the drops can be considered as `local'. The
solution fully computed in the framework of classical fluid-mechanics allows
this regime to be identified and the accuracy of the approximating scaling laws
proposed to describe the propagation of the bridge to be established. It is
shown that the scaling law known for this regime has a very limited region of
accuracy and, as a result, in describing experimental data it has frequently
been applied outside its limits of applicability. The origin of the scaling
law's shortcoming appears to be the fact that it accounts for the capillary
pressure due only to the longitudinal curvature of the free surface as the
driving force for the process. To address this deficiency, the scaling law is
extended to account for both the longitudinal and azimuthal curvatures at the
bridge front which, fortuitously, still results in an explicit analytic
expression for the front's propagation speed. This new expression is then shown
to offer an excellent approximation for both the fully-computed solution and
for experimental data from a range of flow configurations for a remarkably
large proportion of the coalescence process. The derived formula allows one to
predict the speed at which drops coalesce for the duration of the inertial
regime which should be useful for the analysis of experimental data.

bandwidth resources act as micro-servers to compensate the server deficiencies
in balancing the resources between different channel overlays. With deployment
of helper level between server and peers, optimizing the user/helper topology
becomes a challenging task since applying well-known reciprocity-based choking
algorithms is impossible due to the one-directional nature of video streaming
from helpers to users. Because of selfish behavior of peers and lack of central
authority among them, selection of helpers requires coordination. In this
paper, we design a distributed online helper selection mechanism which is
adaptable to supply and demand pattern of various video channels. Our solution
for strategic peers' exploitation from the shared resources of helpers is to
guarantee the convergence to correlated equilibria (CE) among the helper
selection strategies. Online convergence to the set of CE is achieved through
the regret-tracking algorithm which tracks the equilibrium in the presence of
stochastic dynamics of helpers' bandwidth. The resulting CE can help us select
proper cooperation policies. Simulation results demonstrate that our algorithm
achieves good convergence, load distribution on helpers and sustainable
streaming rates for peers.

finding a cost-effective solution to upgrade the cellular backhaul with
pre-deployed optical fibers using FSO links and mirror components. Since the

distance, power, and weather conditions, we adopt an elaborate formulation to

to approach optimal FSO backhaul design, guaranteeing $K$-disjoint paths
connecting each node pair. Next, we derive a column generation method to a

there are two principal differences between the two phenomena: The moat flow is
asymmetrical, probably due to proper motion of sunspots with respect to the
local frame of rest, while the flow in the supergranular cell is highly
symmetrical. Further, the whole moat is a downflow region, while the
supergranule contains the upflow in the centre, which turns into the downflow

We adopt a step-by-step approach whereby we first study the impact of rewiring

assigned a disease status but without disease dynamics, and finally running
network and epidemic dynamics simultaneously. In the case of no labelling and
no epidemic dynamics, we provide both analytic and semi-analytic formulas for

the stochastic dynamics of chemical systems. The CLE's main disadvantage is its
break down in finite time due to the problem of evaluating square roots of
negative quantities whenever the molecule numbers become sufficiently small. We
show that this issue is not a numerical integration problem, rather in many
systems it is intrinsic to all representations of the CLE. Various methods of
correcting the CLE have been proposed which avoid its break down. We show that
these methods introduce undesirable artefacts in the CLE's predictions. In
particular, for unimolecular systems, these correction methods lead to CLE
predictions for the mean concentrations and variance of fluctuations which
disagree with those of the chemical master equation. We show that, by extending
the domain of the CLE to complex space, break down is eliminated, and the CLE's
accuracy for unimolecular systems is restored. Although the molecule numbers
are generally complex, we show that the ""complex CLE"" predicts real-valued
quantities for the mean concentrations, the moments of intrinsic noise, power
spectra and first passage times, hence admitting a physical interpretation. It
is also shown to provide a more accurate approximation of the chemical master
equation of simple biochemical circuits involving bimolecular reactions than
the various corrected forms of the real-valued CLE, the linear-noise
approximation and a commonly used two moment-closure approximation.

  Constraints",,,,,"cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Many applications require recovering a matrix of minimal rank within an
affine constraint set, with matrix completion a notable special case. Because
the problem is NP-hard in general, it is common to replace the matrix rank with
the nuclear norm, which acts as a convenient convex surrogate. While elegant
theoretical conditions elucidate when this replacement is likely to be
successful, they are highly restrictive and convex algorithms fail when the
ambient rank is too high or when the constraint set is poorly structured.
Non-convex alternatives fare somewhat better when carefully tuned; however,
convergence to locally optimal solutions remains a continuing source of
failure. Against this backdrop we derive a deceptively simple and
parameter-free probabilistic PCA-like algorithm that is capable, over a wide
battery of empirical tests, of successful recovery even at the theoretical
limit where the number of measurements equal the degrees of freedom in the
unknown low-rank matrix. Somewhat surprisingly, this is possible even when the
affine constraint set is highly ill-conditioned. While proving general recovery
guarantees remains evasive for non-convex algorithms, Bayesian-inspired or
otherwise, we nonetheless show conditions whereby the underlying cost function
has a unique stationary point located at the global optimum; no existing cost
function we are aware of satisfies this same property. We conclude with a
simple computer vision application involving image rectification and a standard
collaborative filtering benchmark.

underlying extended spiral or ULIRG-type galaxy to contribute less than about
2% or 55% of the typical total Hot DOG IR luminosity, respectively. The two
most distant and luminous targets have similar observed submm to mid-infrared

known to exhibit separate modes of emission, using observations obtained over
approximately 10 yr. We find that the object exhibits two distinct modes of
emission; a strong mode with a broad profile and a weak mode with a narrow
profile. During the strong mode of emission, the pulsar typically radiates very
energetic emission over sequences of ~200-6000 pulses (~60 s-24 min), with
apparent nulls over time-scales of up to a few pulses at a time. Emission
during the weak mode is observed outside of these strong-mode sequences and
manifests as occasional bursts of up to a few clearly detectable pulses at a
time, as well as low-level underlying emission which is only detected through
profile integration. This implies that the previously described null mode may
in fact be representative of the bottom-end of the pulse intensity distribution
for the source. This is supported by the dramatic pulse-to-pulse intensity
modulation and rarity of exceptionally bright pulses observed during both modes
of emission. Coupled with the fact that the source could be interpreted as a
rotating radio transient (RRAT)-like object for the vast majority of the time,
if placed at a further distance, we advance that this object likely represents
a bridge between RRATs and extreme moding pulsars. Further to these emission
properties, we also show that the source is consistent with being a
near-aligned rotator and that it does not exhibit any measurable spin-down rate
variation. These results suggest that nulls observed in other intermittent
objects may in fact be representative of very weak emission without the need
for complete cessation. As such, we argue that longer (> 1 h) observations of
pulsars are required to discern their true modulation properties.

We model the regulated subsidization competition among CPs under a neutral

Although the competition might harm certain CPs, we find that the main cause

factor 100 increase in dielectric strength) and one isomer clearly does not
conform to the general ordering. Finally, the mechanical data surprisingly
indicate that the size of the supramolecular structures responsible for the
Debye process is nearly unchanged in the series.

typically serve as a proxy for intervening galaxies along the line of sight.
Previous studies have found a correlation between the number of these MgII
absorbers and the Faraday rotation measure (RM) at $\approx5$ GHz. We
cross-match a sample of 35,752 optically-identified non-intrinsic MgII
absorption systems with 25,649 polarized background radio sources for which we
have measurements of both the spectral index and RM at 1.4 GHz. We use the
spectral index to split the resulting sample of 599 sources into flat-spectrum
and steep-spectrum subsamples. We find that our flat-spectrum sample shows
significant ($\sim3.5\sigma$) evidence for a correlation between MgII
absorption and RM at 1.4 GHz, while our steep-spectrum sample shows no such
correlation. We argue that such an effect cannot be explained by either
luminosity or other observational effects, by evolution in another confounding
variable, by wavelength-dependent polarization structure in an active galactic
nucleus, by the Galactic foreground, by cosmological expansion, or by partial
coverage models. We conclude that our data are most consistent with intervenors
directly contributing to the Faraday rotation along the line of sight, and that
the intervening systems must therefore have coherent magnetic fields of
substantial strength ($\bar{B}=1.8\pm0.4$ $\mu$G). Nevertheless, the weak
nature of the correlation will require future high-resolution and broadband
radio observations in order to place it on a much firmer statistical footing.

apparent spherical symmetry is dynamical modelling using the spherically
symmetric Jeans equation. Unfortunately this approach suffers from a degeneracy
between the assumed mass density and the second order velocity moments. This
degeneracy can lead to significantly different predictions for the mass content
of the system under investigation, and thus poses a barrier for accurate
estimates of the dark matter content of astrophysical systems. In a series of
papers we describe an algorithm that removes this degeneracy and allows for
unbiased mass estimates of systems of constant or variable mass-to-light ratio.
The present contribution sets the theoretical foundation of the method that
reconstructs a unique kinematic profile for some assumed free functional form
of the mass density. The essence of our method lies in using flexible B-spline
functions for the representation of the radial velocity dispersion in the
spherically symmetric Jeans equation. We demonstrate our algorithm through an
application to synthetic data for the case of an isotropic King model with
fixed mass-to-light ratio, recovering excellent fits of theoretical functions
to observables and a unique solution. The mass-anisotropy degeneracy is removed
to the extent that, for an assumed functional form of the potential and mass
density pair $(\Phi,\rho)$, and a given set of line-of-sight velocity
dispersion $\sigma_{los}^2$ observables, we recover a unique profile for
$\sigma_{rr}^2$ and $\sigma_{tt}^2$. Our algorithm is simple, easy to apply and
provides an efficient means to reconstruct the kinematic profile.

The answer to
the question of glueball existence is probably a necessary step in this
investigation. The existence of the glueball implies the existence of the
decuplet. The model we consider requires that the mass of meson decuplet
dominated by the glueball is enclosed between the masses of the ideal nonet N
and S states.
  This description is applied to the two sets of the tensor mesons. One of them
comprise the well known particles which are attributed to the widely known
nonet $2^{++}$. We argue that they belong to a decuplet if there exists the
isoscalar tensor meson having the mass obeying the condition on glueball

and, hence, on accurate binary-valued circuit models that faithfully model
signal propagation, even throughout a complex design. Unfortunately, it was
recently proved [F\""ugger et al., ASYNC'13] that no existing binary-valued
circuit model proposed so far, including the two most commonly used pure and
inertial delay channels, faithfully captures glitch propagation: For the simple
Short-Pulse Filtration (SPF) problem, which is related to a circuit's ability
to suppress a single glitch, we showed that the quite broad class of bounded
single-history channels either contradict the unsolvability of SPF in bounded
time or the solvability of SPF in unbounded time in physical circuits.
  In this paper, we propose a class of binary circuit models that do not suffer
from this deficiency: Like bounded single-history channels, our involution
channels involve delays that may depend on the time of the previous output
transition. Their characteristic property are delay functions which are based
on involutions, i.e., functions that form their own inverse. A concrete example
of such a delay function, which is derived from a generalized first-order
analog circuit model, reveals that this is not an unrealistic assumption. We
prove that, in sharp contrast to what is possible with bounded single-history
channels, SPF cannot be solved in bounded time due to the nonexistence of a
lower bound on the delay of involution channels, whereas it is easy to provide
an unbounded SPF implementation. It hence follows that binary-valued circuit
models based on involution channels allow to solve SPF precisely when this is
possible in physical circuits. To the best of our knowledge, our model is hence
the very first candidate for a model that indeed guarantees faithful glitch
propagation.

tools that minimize a given \textit{fitness function}, while assuming that each

community is, most proposed fitness functions focus on a particular definition.
As such, these functions do not always lead to partitions that correspond to
those observed in practice. This paper proposes a new flexible fitness function
that allows the identification of communities with distinct characteristics.
Such flexibility was evaluated through the adoption of an immune-inspired
optimization algorithm, named cob-aiNet[C], to identify both disjoint and
overlapping communities in a set of benchmark networks. The results have shown
that the obtained partitions are much closer to the ground-truth than those
obtained by the optimization of the modularity function.

stellar systems with apparent spherical symmetry. However, this method suffers
from a degeneracy between the assumed mass density and the kinematic anisotropy
profile, $\beta(r)$. In a previous work, we laid the theoretical foundations
for an algorithm that combines smoothing B-splines with equations from dynamics
to remove this degeneracy. Specifically, our method reconstructs a unique
kinematic profile of $\sigma_{rr}^2$ and $\sigma_{tt}^2$ for an assumed free
functional form of the potential and mass density $(\Phi,\rho)$ and given a set
of observed line-of-sight velocity dispersion measurements, $\sigma_{los}^2$.
In Paper I (submitted to MNRAS: MN-14-0101-MJ) we demonstrated the efficiency
of our algorithm with a very simple example and we commented on the need for
optimum smoothing of the B-spline representation; this is in order to avoid
unphysical variational behaviour when we have large uncertainty in our data. In
the current contribution we present a process of finding the optimum smoothing
for a given data set by using information of the behaviour from known ideal
theoretical models. Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods are used to explore the
degeneracy in the dynamical modelling process. We validate our model through
applications to synthetic data for systems with constant or variable
mass-to-light ratio $\Upsilon$. In all cases we recover excellent fits of
theoretical functions to observables and unique solutions. Our algorithm is a
robust method for the removal of the mass-anisotropy degeneracy of the
spherically symmetric Jeans equation for an assumed functional form of the mass
density.

star-forming regions suggest that the latter may be characterized by a slightly
lower metallicity than the Sun and older clusters in the solar vicinity.
However, these results are based on small statistics and inhomogeneous
analyses. The Gaia-ESO Survey is observing and homogeneously analyzing large
samples of stars in several young clusters and star-forming regions, hence
allowing us to further investigate this issue.
  Aims. We present a new metallicity determination of the Chamaeleon I
star-forming region, based on the products distributed in the first internal
release of the Gaia-ESO Survey.
  Methods. 48 candidate members of Chamaeleon I have been observed with the
high-resolution spectrograph UVES. We use the surface gravity, lithium line
equivalent width and position in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram to confirm the
cluster members and we use the iron abundance to derive the mean metallicity of
the region.
  Results. Out of the 48 targets, we confirm 15 high probability members.
Considering the metallicity measurements for 9 of them, we find that the iron
abundance of Chamaeleon I is slightly subsolar with a mean value
[Fe/H]=-0.08+/-0.04 dex. This result is in agreement with the metallicity
determination of other nearby star-forming regions and suggests that the
chemical pattern of the youngest stars in the solar neighborhood is indeed more
metal-poor than the Sun. We argue that this evidence may be related to the
chemical distribution of the Gould Belt that contains most of the nearby
star-forming regions and young clusters.

As an interesting
candidate to accommodate light Higgs, in this paper we adopt the scenario of

it may also be interpreted as ""latticized"" gauge-Higgs unification. We point
out that in this scenario Higgs interaction with matter field is anomalous,
i.e. its coupling deviates from what the standard model predicts. The interplay
between the periodicity of physical observables in the Higgs field and the
violation of translational invariance along the extra-space due to the
latticization is argued to play an essential role to get the anomalous
interaction. Though the predicted anomalous Higgs interaction has much
similarity to the one in the gauge-Higgs unification, in the case of
dimensional deconstruction the anomaly exists even if we do not introduce bulk
mass term for the chiral fermion realized by orbifolding, in clear contrast to
the case of gauge-Higgs unification. It in turn means that the anomaly goes
away in the continuum limit of the extra-space.

analyze and clarify the general structure of the $\theta_{23} - \theta_{13} -
\delta$ degeneracy for both the appearance and disappearance channels in a more
complete fashion than what has previously been discussed in the literature. A
full understanding of this degeneracy is of vital importance if $\theta_{23}$
is close to maximal mixing. The relative importance between the appearance and
disappearance channels depends upon the particular setup and how close to
maximal mixing Nature has chosen the value for $\theta_{23}$. For facilities
that operate with a narrow band beam or a wide band beam centered on the first
oscillation extremum, the contribution of the disappearance channel depends
critically on the systematic uncertainties assumed for this channel. Whereas
for facilities that operate at energies above the first oscillation extremum or
at the second oscillation extremum the appearance channels dominate. On the
other hand, for $\delta$ we find that the disappearance channel usually
improves the sensitivity, modestly for facilities around the first oscillation
extremum and more significantly for facilities operating at an energy above the
first oscillation extremum, especially near $\delta \sim \pm \pi/2$.

consider an optically-driven bipartite interacting qubit $AB$ system under the

relationship between the qubits early stage disentanglement and the
qubit-environment entanglement distribution is found. We also show that, under
suitable initial conditions, the qubits energy asymmetry allows the

carbonization of initial aromatic compounds and do not reach a state of glassy
carbon. The magnetization, longitudinal nonlinear response to a weak ac field
and electron magnetic resonance data give evidences for presence of FM clusters
in the samples well above 300 K. A short-range character of the FM ordering in
the Au-doped sample transforms below T$_C \approx$ 210 K into another
inhomogeneous FM state. Besides the FM clusters, this state contains a
subsystem with a long-range FM ordering (matrix) formed by paramagnetic
centers, existing outside the clusters. The nonlinear response data suggest a
percolative character of the long-range FM matrix, which is connected probably
with a porous sample structure. The magnetization data give evidence for the
formation of an inhomogeneous state in the Co-doped sample, similar to that in
the Au-doped one. However, this state is formed at higher temperatures, lying
well above 350 K, and exhibits a more homogeneous arrangement of the FM
nanoparticles and the FM matrix. Temperature dependence of the magnetization in
the Au-doped sample is attributable to changes of the domain formation regime
in the FM matrix on cooling, connected with the inhomogeneous character of its
FM state. Such peculiarity is absent in the Co-doped sample below 350 K, which
is in agreement with formation of the FM state in this sample at much higher
temperatures. Further cooling below T ~ 3(10) K leads to a steep increase of
the magnetization in both samples. This is attributable to the domain
rearrangement in the inhomogeneous FM state at low temperatures.

detail the structural changes induced by the electric field. We show that,
contrary to what is assumed in previous experimental works, only one ZrNCl
layer is electrochemically doped and that this induces large structural changes
within the layer. Surprisingly, despite these structural and electronic
changes, the density of states at the Fermi energy is independent of the
doping. Our findings imply a substantial revision of the phase diagram of
electrochemically doped ZrNCl and elucidate crucial differences with
superconductivity in Li intercalated bulk ZrNCl.

monolayer on the cylinder's surface. Continued agitation initiates a sequence
of instabilities of this monolayer, which first forms periodic
wavy-stripe-shaped transverse density modulation in the monolayer and then
ejects narrow and long particle-jets from the tips of these stripes. These jets
finally coalesce laterally to form a homogeneous spreading front that is
layered along the spreading direction. These remarkable growth patterns are
related to a time evolving frictional drag between the moving charged glass
particles and the countercharges on the plastic container. The results provide
insight into the multiscale time-dependent tribolelectric processes and
motivates further investigation into the microscopic causes of these
macroscopic dynamical instabilities and spatial structures.

minimizing non-convex error functions over continuous, high dimensional spaces.
Gradient descent or quasi-Newton methods are almost ubiquitously used to
perform such minimizations, and it is often thought that a main source of
difficulty for these local methods to find the global minimum is the
proliferation of local minima with much higher error than the global minimum.
Here we argue, based on results from statistical physics, random matrix theory,
neural network theory, and empirical evidence, that a deeper and more profound
difficulty originates from the proliferation of saddle points, not local
minima, especially in high dimensional problems of practical interest. Such
saddle points are surrounded by high error plateaus that can dramatically slow
down learning, and give the illusory impression of the existence of a local
minimum. Motivated by these arguments, we propose a new approach to
second-order optimization, the saddle-free Newton method, that can rapidly
escape high dimensional saddle points, unlike gradient descent and quasi-Newton
methods. We apply this algorithm to deep or recurrent neural network training,
and provide numerical evidence for its superior optimization performance.

thus the concentration of carrier varies with the ferroelectric polarization.
Furthermore, the interface magnetization, which is nearly proportional to the

leading to strong intrinsic magnetoelectric effects at the interface of
originally nonmagnetic KTaO3 and PbTiO3. Interestingly, a
ferromagnetic-nonmagnetic transition tuned by an applied electric field can be
realized at the p-type interface. This suggests an illuminating approach to
multiferroic materials beyond conventional single-phase multiferroics and

was computed in spherical symmetry with sophisticated neutrino transport and
whose Ye evolution was post-processed by including neutrino oscillations both
between active and active-sterile flavors. We also take into account the
alpha-effect as well as weak magnetism and recoil corrections in the neutrino
absorption and emission processes. We observe effects on the Ye evolution which
depend in a subtle way on the relative radial positions of the sterile MSW
resonances, of collective flavor transformations, and on the formation of alpha
particles. For the adopted supernova progenitor, we find that neutrino
oscillations, also to a sterile state with eV-mass, do not significantly affect
the element formation and in particular cannot make the post-explosion wind
outflow neutron rich enough to activate a strong r-process. Our conclusions
become even more robust when, in order to mimic equation-of-state dependent
corrections due to nucleon potential effects in the dense-medium neutrino
opacities, six cases with reduced Ye in the wind are considered. In these
cases, despite the conversion of active neutrinos to sterile neutrinos, Ye
increases or is not significantly lowered compared to the values obtained
without oscillations and active flavor transformations. This is a consequence
of a complicated interplay between sterile-neutrino production,
neutrino-neutrino interactions, and alpha-effect.

amenable to mesh adaption; (ii) using a Chebyshev filter to construct a
subspace which is an approximation to the occupied eigenspace in a given
self-consistent field iteration; (iii) using a localization procedure to
construct a non-orthogonal localized basis spanning the Chebyshev filtered
subspace; (iv) using a Fermi-operator expansion in terms of the
subspace-projected Hamiltonian represented in the non-orthogonal localized

benchmark systems involving pseudopotential calculations on metallic aluminum
nano-clusters up to 3430 atoms and on insulating alkane chains up to 7052

chemical accuracy can be obtained, and a subquadratic-scaling with system size
was observed for the range of materials systems studied. In particular, for the
alkane chains---close to linear-scaling is observed, whereas, for aluminum
nano-clusters---the scaling is observed to be $\mathcal{O} (N^{1.46})$. For
all-electron calculations on silicon nano-clusters, the scaling with the number

was observed in molecular lines with the aim of discover and study molecular
outflows. We mapped a region of 3'x3' centered at MSXG34 using the Atacama
Submillimeter Telescope Experiment in the 12CO J=3-2 and HCO+ J=4-3 lines with
an angular and spectral resolution of 22"" and 0.11 km/s, respectively.
Additionally, public 13CO J=1-0 and near-IR UKIDSS data obtained from the
Galactic Ring Survey and the WFCAM Sciencie Archive, respectively, were
analyzed. We found that the 12CO spectra towards the YSO present a
self-absorption dip, as it is usual in star forming regions, and spectral wings
evidencing outflow activity. The HCO+ was detected only towards the MSXG34
position at v_LSR ~ 14.2 km/s, in coincidence with the 12CO absorption dip and
approximately with the velocity of previous ammonia observations. HCO+ and NH3
are known to be enhanced in molecular outflows. Analyzing the spectral wings of
the 12CO line, we discovered misaligned red- and blue-shifted molecular
outflows associated with MSXG34. The near-IR emission shows a cone-like shape
nebulosity composed by two arc-like features related to the YSO, which can be
due to a cavity cleared in the circumstellar material by a precessing jet. This
can explain the misalignment in the molecular outflows. From the analysis of
the 13CO J=1--0 data we suggest that the YSO is very likely related to a
molecular clump ranging between 10 and 14 km/s. This suggests that MSXG34, with
an associated central velocity of about 14 km/s, may be located in the

for cellular communications systems with users running delay-tolerant and
real-time applications, generating elastic and inelastic traffic on the network

optimization is cast under a utility proportional fairness framework aiming at
maximizing the cellular systems utility whilst allocating users the resource

procedural temporal and computational efficiency. Ultimately, the sensitivity

  Radar-Coexistent Cellular Networks",,,,,"cs.NI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Spectrum sharing is an elegant solution to addressing the scarcity of the
bandwidth for wireless communications systems. This research studies the
feasibility of sharing the spectrum between sectorized cellular systems and
stationary radars interfering with certain sectors of the communications
infrastructure. It also explores allocating optimal resources to mobile devices
in order to provide with the quality of service for all running applications
whilst growing the communications network spectrally coexistent with the radar
systems. The rate allocation problem is formulated as two convex optimizations,
where the radar-interfering sector assignments are extracted from the portion
of the spectrum non-overlapping with the radar operating frequency. Such a
double-stage resource allocation procedure inherits the fairness into the rate
allocation scheme by first assigning the spectrally radar-overlapping
resources.

cold dark matter (SFCDM) and a gauge singlet scalar (singlet Higgs) as a
mediator. The parameter space of the SM is enlarged by seven new ones. We
obtain the total annihilation cross section of singlet fermions to the SM
particles and singlet Higgs at tree level. Regarding the relic abundance
constraint obtained by WMAP observations, we study the dependency on each
parameter separately, for dark matter masses up to 1 TeV. In particular, the
coupling of SFCDM to singlet Higgs $g_s$, the SFCDM mass $m_\psi$, the second
Higgs mass $m_{h_2}$, and the Higgs bosons mixing angel $\theta$ are
investigated accurately. Three other parameters play no significant role. For a
maximal mixing of Higgs bosons or at resonances, $g_s$ is applicable for the
perturbation theory at tree level. We also obtain the scattering cross section
of SFCDM off nucleons and compare our results with experiments which have
already reported data in this mass range; XENON100, LUX, COUPP and PICASSO
collaborations. Our results show that the SFCDM is excluded by these
experiments for choosing parameters which are consistent with perturbation
theory and relic abundance constraints.

Banjaras and the Kolams. The Banjaras are an ancient tribe connected with the
gypsies of Europe while the Kolams have been foragers until recently. They
share their landscape with each other and also with the Gonds whose astronomy
was reported previously (Vahia and Halkare, 2013). The primary profession of
the Banjaras was trade, based on the large-scale movement of goods over long
distances, but their services were taken over by the railways about one hundred
years ago. Since then the Banjaras have begun the long journey to a sedentary
lifestyle. Meanwhile, the Kolams were foragers until about fifty years ago when
the Government of India began to help them lead a settled life.
  Here, we compare their astronomical beliefs of the Banjaras and the Kolams,
which indicate the strong sense of identity that each community possesses. Our
study also highlights their perspective about the sky and its relation to their
daily lives. We show that apart from the absolute importance of the data on
human perception of the sky, the data also reveal subtle aspects of
interactions between physically co-located but otherwise isolated communities
as well as their own lifestyles. We also show that there is a strong
relationship between profession and perspective of the sky.
