protoplanetary disks with dust depleted inner regions. The mechanism
responsible for this depletion is still under debate. To constrain the models
it is mandatory to have a good understanding of the properties of the gas
content of the inner disk. Using X-Shooter broad band -UV to NIR- medium
resolution spectroscopy we derive the stellar, accretion, and wind properties
of a sample of 22 TDs. The analysis of these properties allows us to put strong

which is not accessible with any other observational technique. We fit the
spectra with a self-consistent procedure to derive simultaneously SpT,Av,and
mass accretion rates (Macc) of the targets. From forbidden emission lines we
derive the wind properties of the targets. Comparing our findings to values for
cTTs, we find that Macc and wind properties of 80% of the TDs in our sample,
which is strongly biased towards strongly accreting objects, are comparable to
those of cTTs. Thus, there are (at least) some TDs with Macc compatible with
those of cTTs, irrespective of the size of the dust inner hole.Only in 2 cases
Macc are much lower, while the wind properties are similar. We do not see any
strong trend of Macc with the size of the dust depleted cavity, nor with the
presence of a dusty optically thick disk close to the star. In the TDs in our
sample there is a gas rich inner disk with density similar to that of cTTs
disks. At least for some TDs, the process responsible of the inner disk
clearing should allow for a transfer of gas from the outer disk to the inner
region. This should proceed at a rate that does not depend on the physical
mechanism producing the gap seen in the dust emission and results in a gas
density in the inner disk similar to that of unperturbed disks around stars of
similar mass.

an ac gate voltage, Rabi oscillation takes place among quantum states formed by
QD and MBSs, which makes it possible to reveal bizarre properties of MBSs by
sensing the electron occupation on QD. Especially, one should be able to
observe the fractional Josephson relation $\cos(\pi\Phi/\Phi_0)$ unique to MBSs
with $\Phi$ the magnetic flux applied in the SQUID and $\Phi_0=hc/2e$ the flux

first-principles density functional calculations, we explore the effect of
ferroelectric polarization of electron-doped BaTiO3 (n-BaTiO3) on the
spin-polarized transmission across the SrRuO3/n-BaTiO3 (001) interface. Our

that ferroelectric polarization reversal leads to a change in the transport
spin polarization from -65% to -98%. We show that this effect stems from the
large difference in Fermi wave vectors between up- and down-spins in
ferromagnetic SrRuO3 and a change in the transport regime driven by
ferroelectric polarization switching. The predicted sizeable change in the spin
polarization provides a non-volatile mechanism to electrically control spin
injection in semiconductor-based spintronics devices.

changed from its normal PG 1159 spectrum to that of an emission-line
low-luminosity early-type Wolf-Rayet [WCE] star. After a few days, Lo 4
reverted to its normal, predominantly absorption-line PG 1159 type. To
determine whether such events recur, and if so how often, I monitored the
optical spectrum of Lo 4 from early 2003 to early 2012. Out of 81 spectra taken
at random dates, four of them revealed mass-loss outbursts similar to that seen
in 1992. This indicates that the episodes recur approximately every 100 days
(if the recurrence rate has been approximately constant and the duration of a
typical episode is ~5 days), and that the star is in a high-mass-loss state
about 5% of the time. Since the enhanced stellar wind is hydrogen-deficient, it
arises from the photosphere and is unlikely to be related to phenomena such as
a binary or planetary companion or infalling dust. I speculate on plausible
mechanisms for these unique outbursts, including the possibility that they are
related to the non-radial GW Vir-type pulsations exhibited by Lo 4. The central
star of the PN NGC 246 has stellar parameters similar to those of Lo 4, and it
is also a GW Vir-type pulsator with similar pulsation periods. I obtained 167

bound-state S-Matrix embedded in a unique weak coupling massless SU(5) field
theory emerges. The states and interactions of the Standard Model are enhanced,
and the underlying SU(5) unification suppressed, by a wee parton divergence
phenomenon involving wee gauge bosons coupled to S-Matrix massless fermion
anomalies. Confinement, chiral symmetry breaking, the parton model, electroweak

Most significantly, perhaps, there is a Higgs boson but, as seen experimentally

macroscopic laws that have been quantified by mathematical models. To resolve
this further, quantitative and discriminant analyses were performed for the
purpose of comparing alternative models for their abilities to describe and
predict tumor growth. For this we used two in vivo experimental systems, an
ectopic syngeneic tumor (Lewis lung carcinoma) and an orthotopically
xenografted human breast carcinoma. The goals were threefold: to 1) determine a
statistical model for description of the volume measurement error, 2) establish
the descriptive power of each model, using several goodness-of-fit metrics and
a study of parametric identifiability, and 3) assess the models ability to
forecast future tumor growth.
  Nine models were compared that included the exponential, power law, Gompertz
and (generalized) logistic formalisms. The Gompertz and power law provided the
most parsimonious and parametrically identifiable description of the lung data,
whereas the breast data were best captured by the Gompertz and
exponential-linear models. The latter also exhibited the highest predictive
power for the breast tumor growth curves, with excellent prediction scores
(greater than 80$\%$) extending out as far as 12 days. In contrast, for the
lung data, none of the models were able to achieve substantial prediction rates
(greater than 70$\%$) further than the next day data point. In this context,
adjunction of a priori information on the parameter distribution led to
considerable improvement of predictions.
  These results not only have important implications for biological theories of
tumor growth and the use of mathematical modeling in preclinical anti-cancer
drug investigations, but also may assist in defining how mathematical models
could serve as potential prognostic tools in the clinical setting.

shear and rotation terms for dark matter fluid in clustering dark energy
models. We evaluate, for different equations of state, the effects of these
terms on the linear overdensity threshold parameter, $\delta_{\rm c}$, and on
the virial overdensity, $\Delta_{\rm V}$. The evaluation of their effects on
$\delta_{\rm c}$ allows us to infer the modifications occurring on the mass
function. Due to ambiguities in the definition of the halo mass in the case of
clustering dark energy, we consider two different situations: the first is the
classical one where the mass is of the dark matter halo only, while the second
one is given by the sum of the mass of dark matter and dark energy. As
previously found, the spherical collapse model becomes mass dependant and the
two additional terms oppose to the collapse of the perturbations, especially on
galactic scales, with respect to the spherical non-rotating model, while on
clusters scales the effects of shear and rotation become negligible. The values
for $\delta_{\rm c}$ and $\Delta_{\rm V}$ are higher than the standard
spherical model. Regarding the effects of the additional non-linear terms on
the mass function, we evaluate the number density of halos. As expected, major
differences appear at high masses and redshifts. In particular, quintessence
(phantom) models predict more (less) objects with respect to the $\Lambda$CDM
model and the mass correction due to the contribution of the dark energy
component has negligible effects on the overall number of structures.

at higher risk of infection and implementing targeted surveillance and control
measures. One important ingredient to consider is the pattern of
disease-transmission contacts among the elements, however lack of data or
delays in providing updated records may hinder its use, especially for
time-varying patterns. Here we explore to what extent it is possible to use
past temporal data of a system's pattern of contacts to predict the risk of
infection of its elements during an emerging outbreak, in absence of updated
data. We focus on two real-world temporal systems; a livestock displacements
trade network among animal holdings, and a network of sexual encounters in
high-end prostitution. We define the node's loyalty as a local measure of its
tendency to maintain contacts with the same elements over time, and uncover
important non-trivial correlations with the node's epidemic risk. We show that
a risk assessment analysis incorporating this knowledge and based on past
structural and temporal pattern properties provides accurate predictions for
both systems. Its generalizability is tested by introducing a theoretical model
for generating synthetic temporal networks. High accuracy of our predictions is
recovered across different settings, while the amount of possible predictions
is system-specific. The proposed method can provide crucial information for the
setup of targeted intervention strategies.

some will it become symptomatic disease. Meanwhile, it was recently shown in
animal models that a tumor can produce both stimulators and inhibitors of its
own blood supply. To explain the autopsy findings in light of the preclinical
research data, we propose a mathematical model of cancer development at the
organism scale describing a growing population of metastases, which, together
with the primary tumor, can exert a progressively greater level of systemic
angiogenesis-inhibitory influence that eventually overcomes local angiogenesis
stimulation to suppress the growth of all lesions. As a departure from modeling
efforts to date, we look not just at signaling from and effects on the primary
tumor, but integrate over this increasingly negative global signaling from all
sources to track the development of total tumor burden. This in silico study of
the dynamics of the tumor/metastasis system identifies ranges of parameter
values where mutual angio-inhibitory interactions within a population of tumor
lesions could yield global dormancy, i.e., an organism-level homeostatic steady
state in total tumor burden. Given that mortality arises most often from
metastatic disease rather than growth of the primary per se, this finding may
have important therapeutic implications.

hamiltonian action on ambitwistor space, both in general dimension and in its

structure formation. Particularly, photons below the Lyman limit can escape the
star forming regions and produce a background ultraviolet (UV) flux which
consequently may influence the pristine halos far away from the radiation
sources. These photons can quench the formation of molecular hydrogen by
photo-detachment of $\rm H^{-}$. In this study, we explore the impact of such
UV radiation on fragmentation in massive primordial halos of a few times $\rm
10^{7}$~M${_\odot}$. To accomplish this goal, we perform high resolution
cosmological simulations for two distinct halos and vary the strength of the
impinging background UV field in units of $\rm J_{21}$. We further make use of
sink particles to follow the evolution for 10,000 years after reaching the
maximum refinement level. No vigorous fragmentation is observed in UV
illuminated halos while the accretion rate changes according to the thermal
properties. Our findings show that a few 100-10, 000 solar mass protostars are
formed when halos are irradiated by $\rm J_{21}=10-500$ at $\rm z>10$ and
suggest a strong relation between the strength of UV flux and mass of a
protostar. This mode of star formation is quite different from minihalos, as
higher accretion rates of about $\rm 0.01-0.1$ M$_{\odot}$/yr are observed by
the end of our simulations. The resulting massive stars are the potential
cradles for the formation of intermediate mass black holes at earlier cosmic
times and contribute to the formation of a global X-ray background.

central profiles have simultaneously extended envelopes of shallow profiles in
the outskirts, whereas galaxies with shallow central profiles are accompanied
by steep density profiles in the outskirts. These properties are in accord with
those of the Sersic profile family. Moreover, galaxies with steep central
profiles form their central regions in smaller denser subunits that possibly
merge subsequently, which naturally leads to formation of bulges. In contrast,
galaxies with shallow central profiles form their central regions in a coherent
fashion without significant substructure, a necessary condition for disk galaxy
formation. Thus, the scenario is self-consistent with respect to the
correlation between observed galaxy morphology and Sersic index. We predict
further that clusters of galaxies should display a similar trend, which should

quantum critical system in $D = 1$ spatial dimensions, the entanglement contour
allows us to determine the central charge of the underlying conformal field
theory from just a single partition of the system into regions A and B, (using
the entanglement entropy for the same task requires considering several
partitions). In $D \geq 2$ dimensions, the entanglement contour can distinguish
between gapped and gapless phases that obey a same boundary law for
entanglement entropy. During a local or global quantum quench, the
time-dependent contour provides a detailed account of the dynamics of
entanglement, including propagating entanglement waves, which offers a
microscopic explanation of the behavior of the entanglement entropy as a

homogeneous distances on the Heisenberg groups that have the Besicovitch
Covering Property (BCP). This property is well known to be one of the
fundamental tools of measure theory, with strong connections with the theory of
differentiation of measures. We prove that BCP is satisfied by the homogeneous
distances whose unit ball centered at the origin coincides with an Euclidean
ball. Such homogeneous distances do exist on any Carnot group by a result of
Hebisch and Sikora. In the Heisenberg groups, they are related to the
Cygan-Koranyi (also called Koranyi) distance. They were considered in
particular by Lee and Naor to provide a counterexample to the Goemans-Linial
conjecture in theoretical computer science. To put our result in perspective,
we also prove two geometric criteria that imply the non-validity of BCP,
showing that in some sense our example is sharp. Our first criterion applies in
particular to commonly used homogeneous distances on the Heisenberg groups,
such as the Cygan-Koranyi and Carnot-Caratheodory distances that are already

demonstrated the existence of a quantum bounce in loop quantum cosmology in
various models. A key issue pertaining to the robustness of the bounce and the
associated physics is to understand the quantum evolution for more general
initial states which may depart significantly from Gaussianity and may have no
well defined peakedness properties. The analysis of such states, including
squeezed and highly non-Gaussian states, has been computationally challenging
until now. In this manuscript, we overcome these challenges by using the
Chimera scheme for the spatially flat, homogeneous and isotropic model sourced
with a massless scalar field. We demonstrate that the quantum bounce in this
model occurs even for states which are highly squeezed or are non-Gaussian with
multiple peaks and with little resemblance to semi-classical states. The
existence of the bounce is found to be robust, being independent of the
properties of the states. The evolution of squeezed and non-Gaussian states
turns out to be qualitatively similar to that of Gaussian states, and satisfies
strong constraints on the growth of the relative fluctuations across the
bounce. We also compare the results from the effective dynamics and find that,
although it captures the qualitative aspects of the evolution for squeezed and
highly non-Gaussian states, it always underestimates the bounce volume. We show
that various properties of the evolution, such as the energy density at the
bounce, are in excellent agreement with the predictions from an exactly
solvable loop quantum cosmological model for arbitrary states.

star formation history, but correlation between the two depends on the highly
debated presence/strength of a metallicity bias. To investigate this
correlation, we use a phenomenological model that successfully describes star
formation rates, luminosities and stellar masses of star forming galaxies,
applying it to GRB production. We predict luminosities, stellar masses, and
metallicities of host galaxies depending on the metallicity bias. Our
best-fitting model includes a moderate metallicity bias, broadly consistent
with the large majority of long-duration GRBs in metal-poor environments
originating from collapsars (probability ~83%), but with a secondary
contribution (~17%) from metal-independent production channels, such as binary
evolution. Because of the mass-metallicity relation of galaxies, the maximum
likelihood model predicts that the metal-independent channel becomes dominant
at z<2, where hosts have higher metallicities and collapsars are suppressed.
This possibly explains why some studies find no clear evidence of a metal-bias
based on low-z samples. However, while metallicity predictions match
observations well at high redshift, there is tension with low redshift
observations, since a significant fraction of GRB hosts are predicted to have
(near-)solar metallicity. This is in contrast to observations, unless obscured,
metal-rich hosts are preferentially missed in current datasets, and suggests
that lower efficiencies of the metal-independent GRB channel might be preferred
following a comprehensive fit from complete samples. Overall, we are able to
establish the presence of a metallicity bias for GRB production, but continued
characterization of GRB host galaxies is needed to quantify its strength.

ground-based Subaru Telescope imaging we identify a population of blended
galaxies that are blended to such a large degree that they are detected as
single objects in the ground-based monochromatic imaging, which we label as
'ambiguous blends'. For deep imaging data, such as the depth targeted with the
Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST), the ambiguous blend population is both
large ($\sim 14$%) and has a distribution of ellipticities that is different
from that of unblended objects in a way that will likely be important for the
weak lensing measurements. Most notably, for a limiting magnitude of $i \sim
27$ we find that ambiguous blending results in a ~14% increase in shear noise
(or ~12% decrease in the effective projected number density of lensed galaxies;
neff) due to 1) larger intrinsic ellipticity dispersion, 2) a scaling with the
galaxy number density $N_{gal}$ that is shallower than 1/$\sqrt{N_{gal}}$. For
the LSST Gold Sample ($i < 25.3$) there is a ~7% increase in shear noise (or
~7% decrease in $n_{eff}$). More importantly than these increases in the shear
noise, we find that the ellipticity distribution of ambiguous blends has an RMS
13% larger than that of non-blended galaxies. Given the need of future weak
lensing surveys to constrain the ellipticity distribution of galaxies to better
than a percent in order to mitigate cosmic shear multiplicative biases, the

investigated. A model of this effect developed for a DC plasma is modified and
applied to explain new experimental data in RF plasma. Second, the formation of
natural cavities is surveyed; a radial ion drag proposed to occur due to a
curved sheath is considered in conjunction with thermophoresis and a flattened
confinement potential above the center of the electrode. Finally, cavity
formation unexpectedly occurs upon increasing the probe potential above the

of pairwise distances at each discretization point along the path and the
nudged elastic band method then used to find an optimal path on this image
dependent pair potential (IDPP) surface. This provides an initial path for the
more computationally intensive calculations of the true minimum energy path
using some method of choice for evaluating the energy and atomic forces, for
example by ab initio or density functional theory. The optimal path on the IDPP
surface is significantly closer to the true minimum energy path than a linear
interpolation of the Cartesian coordinates and, therefore, reduces the number
of iterations needed to reach convergence and averts divergence in the
electronic structure calculations when atoms are brought too close to each
other in the initial path. The method is illustrated with three examples: (1)
rotation of a methyl group in an ethane molecule, (2) an exchange of atoms in
an island on a crystal surface, and (3) an exchange of two Si-atoms in
amorphous silicon. In all three cases, the computational effort in finding the
minimum energy path with DFT was reduced by a factor ranging from 50 % to an
order of magnitude by using an IDPP path as the initial path. The time required

16A (8.0+/-0.4 A) and Luhman 16B (3.8+/-0.4 A). Interestingly, this is the
first detection of Li I absorption in a T dwarf. Combined with the lack of
surface gravity features, the Li I detection constrains the system age to 0.1 -
3 Gyr. In the NIR data, we find strong KI absorption at 1.168, 1.177, 1.243,
and 1.254 {\mu}m in both components. Compared to the strength of KI line
absorption in equivalent spectral subtype brown dwarfs, Luhman 16A is weaker
while Luhman 16B is stronger. Analyzing the spectral region around each doublet
in distance scaled flux units and comparing the two sources, we confirm the J
band flux reversal and find that Luhman 16B has a brighter continuum in the
1.17 {\mu}m and 1.25 {\mu}m regions than Luhman 16A. Converting flux units to a
brightness temperature we interpret this to mean that the secondary is ~ 50 K
warmer than the primary in regions dominated by condensate grain scattering.
One plausible explanation for this difference is that Luhman 16B has thinner
clouds or patchy holes in its atmosphere allowing us to see to deeper, hotter
regions. We also detect comparably strong FeH in the 0.9896 {\mu}m Wing-Ford
band for both components. Traditionally, a signpost of changing atmosphere
conditions from late-type L to early T dwarfs, the persistence and similarity
of FeH at 0.9896 {\mu}m in both Luhman 16A and Luhman 16B is an indication of
homogenous atmosphere conditions. We calculate bolometric luminosities from
observed data supplemented with best fit models for longer wavelengths and find
the components are consistent within 1{\sigma} with resultant Teffs of
1310+/-30 K and 1280+/-75 K for Luhman 16AB respectively.

exposed to high velocity impacts for much or all of its existence. Some of
these craters were produced by the impact of long period comets (LPCs). These
probably originated in the Oort cloud, and were put into their present orbits
through gravitational perturbations arising from the Galactic tide and stellar
encounters, both of which are modulated by the solar motion about the Galaxy.
Here we construct dynamicalmodels of these mechanisms in order to predict the
time-varying impact rate of LPCs and the angular distribution of their
perihelia (which is observed to be non-uniform). Comparing the predictions of
these dynamical models with other models, we conclude that cometary impacts
induced by the solar motion contribute only a small fraction of terrestrial
impact craters over the past 250 Myr. Over this time scale the apparent
cratering rate is dominated by a secular increase towards the present, which
might be the result of the disruption of a large asteroid. Our dynamical
models, together with the solar apex motion, predict a non-uniform angular
distribution of the perihelia, without needing to invoke the existence of a
massive body in the outer Oort cloud. Our results are reasonably robust to
changes in the parameters of the Galaxy model, Oort cloud, and stellar
encounters.

with an effectively solute-only form, by integrating out the solvent degrees of
freedom. The total effective solute potential in the effective solute grand
partition function can be decomposed into components which are potentials of
mean force for isolated groups of one, two, three, etc, solute molecules.
Secondly, from the first result, now assuming low solute concentration, MM
derived an expansion for the osmotic pressure in powers of the solute
concentration, in complete analogy with the virial expansion of gas pressure in
powers of the density at low density. The molecular expressions found for the
osmotic virial coefficients have exactly the same form as the corresponding gas
virial coefficients, with potentials of mean force replacing vacuum potentials.
In this paper we restrict ourselves to binary liquid solutions with solute
species $A$ and solvent species $B$ and do three things: (a) By working with a
semi-grand canonical ensemble (grand with respect to solvent only) instead of
the grand canonical ensemble used by MM, and avoiding graphical methods, we
have greatly simplified the derivation of the first MM result,(b) by using a
simple nongraphical method developed by van Kampen for gases, we have greatly
simplified the derivation of the second MM result,i.e.,the osmotic pressure
virial expansion; as a by-product, we show the precise relation between MM
theory and Widom potential distribution theory, and (c) we have extended MM

evolution of the coupling constant with lattice spacing is measured at the

asymptotically free and hence QCD-like. The lattice spacing is varied by
changing the number of lattice sites, $N_t$, in the Euclidean time direction.
QCD with 3 flavours is studied for comparison. Since this theory is expected to
be conformal, with an infrared fixed point, the coupling constant at the chiral
transition should approach a non-zero value as $N_t$ becomes large. Our earlier
simulations on lattices with $N_t=4$ and $N_t=6$ exhibited a significant
decrease in coupling at the chiral transition as $N_t$ was increased. We have
now extended these simulations to $N_t=8$, and performed additional simulations
at $N_t=6$ to measure the coupling constant at the chiral transition more
precisely. These indicate that while there is an appreciable decrease in
coupling between $N_t=6$ and $N_t=8$, this is much smaller than that between
$N_t=4$ and $N_t=6$. Thus we are hopeful that we are approaching the

gravitational field of the collapsing star. The two main initial conditions in
the far past placed on the quantum field from which particles arise, are the
Hartle Hawking vacuum and the Unruh vacuum. The former leads to a time
symmetric thermal bath of radiation, while the latter to a flux of radiation
coming out of the collapsing star. The energy of Hawking radiation in the
interior of the collapsing star is negative and equal in magnitude to its value
at future infinity. This work investigates the backreaction of Hawking
radiation on the interior of a gravitationally collapsing star, in a
Hartle-Hawking initial vacuum. It shows that due to the negative energy Hawking
radiation in the interior, the collapse of the star stops at a finite radius,
before the singularity and the event horizon of a black hole have a chance to
form. That is, the star bounces instead of collapsing to a black hole. A
trapped surface near the last stage of the star's collapse to its minimum size
may still exist temporarily. Its formation depends on the details of collapse.
Results for the case of Hawking flux of radiation with the Unruh initial state,

free space implies the nonexistence of small coherent structures. We use a
normal form to demonstrate the smoothing property on specific examples, so that
it can be seen that there are indeed equations for which the hypotheses of the
general theorem hold. The nonexistence result is thus established through the
novel combination of small divisor estimates and dispersive smoothing
estimates. The examples treated include the Korteweg-de Vries equation and the
Kawahara equation.

interactions of particles on a liquid surface. The variation of the
gravitational potential energies of the particles resulting from their descents
in the gel coupled with the superposition principle of Nicolson allow a fair
estimation of the distance dependent attractive energy of the particles. This
energy follows a modified Bessel function of the second kind with a
characteristic elastocapillary decay length that decreases with the elasticity
of the medium. An interesting finding of this study is that the particles on
the gel move towards each other as if the system possesses a negative
diffusivity that is inversely proportional to friction. This study illustrates
how the capillary interaction of particles is modified by the elasticity of the
medium, which is expected to have important implications in the surface force
driven self-assembly of particles. In particular, this study points out that
the range and the strength of the capillary interaction can be tuned in by
appropriate choices of the elasticity of the support and the interfacial
tension of the surrounding medium. Manipulation of the particle interactions is
exemplified in such fascinating mimicry of the biological processes as the
tubulation, phagocytic engulfment and in the assembly of particles that can be

The isotropic liquid phase coexists with the Conway-Torquato (CT) crystal phase
at intermediate densities. At higher densities, we find that the CT phase
undergoes another first-order phase transition to one associated with the
densest-known crystal. We find no evidence for stable rotator (or plastic) or
nematic phases. We also generate the maximally random jammed (MRJ) packings of

rapid compression of the liquid. We find that such MRJ packings are
hyperuniform with an average packing fraction of 0.770, which is considerably
larger than the corresponding value for identical spheres (about 0.64). We
conclude with some simple observations concerning what types of phase
transitions might be expected in general hard-particle systems based on the

topic in nonlinear dynamics. When coupled oscillators exhibit relatively weak,
intermittent synchrony, the trajectory in the phase space spends a substantial
fraction of time away from a vicinity of a synchronized state. Thus to describe
and understand the observed dynamics one may consider both synchronized
episodes and desynchronized episodes (the episodes when oscillators are not
synchronous). This mini-review discusses recent developments in this area. We
explain how one can consider variation in synchrony on the very short
time-scales, provided that there is some degree of overall synchrony. We show
how to implement this approach in the case of intermittent phase locking,
review several recent examples of the application of these ideas to
experimental data and modeling systems, and discuss when and why these methods

analytically and compared with those of the corresponding $D$-dimensional
short-range model, leading to conclude that the usual mapping between one
dimensional long-range models and $D$-dimensional short-range models holds
exactly for this system, in contrast to models with Ising spins. Moreover, the
critical exponents of the pure model and those of the random field model
satisfy a relationship that mimics the dimensional reduction rule. The absence
of a spin-glass phase is strongly supported by the local stability analysis of

investigating the $\Lambda(1405)$ resonance with the coupled-channel Complex
Scaling Method (ccCSM) in which the $\Lambda(1405)$ is treated as a
hadron-molecular state of a $\bar{K}N$-$\pi\Sigma$ coupled system. We use a
$\bar{K}N$(-$\pi Y$) potential based on the chiral SU(3) theory. In this
article, we report the double-pole nature of the $\Lambda(1405)$, which is a
characteristic property predicted by many studies with chiral SU(3)-based
models. With the help of the complex-range Gaussian basis in ccCSM, we have
found successfully another pole besides a pole near the $\bar{K}N$ threshold
(called higher pole) which was found in our previous work with the real-range
Gaussian basis. The new pole (called lower pole) is found far below $\bar{K}N$
threshold: $(M, -\Gamma/2)=(1395, -138)$ MeV when $f_\pi=110$ MeV. In spite of
so broad width of the lower-pole state, the state is clearly identified with
good separation from continuum states, since the oscillatory behavior of the
continuum states is improved owing to the complex-range Gaussian basis.
Analyzing the ccCSM wave function of the lower pole, we have revealed
explicitly that the lower-pole state is dominated by the $\pi\Sigma$ component
rather than the $\bar{K}N$ component. We have confirmed that the ccCSM wave
function is correctly connected to the asymptotic form of the resonance wave
function. We have estimated the meson-baryon mean distance for the lower-pole
state as well as for the higher-pole state. In addition, we have investigated
the origin of the appearance of the lower pole. The lower pole is confirmed to
be generated by the energy dependence attributed to the chiral dynamics, by
comparing the result of an energy-independent potential.

the same time to avoid finite time future singularities, bounds on the value of
the cosmological constant and on the values of the Skyrme couplings must be
set. The upper bound on the cosmological constant, which depends also on the
initial conditions is closely related to the fact that the baryons appear below
1 GeV. The upper bound on the cosmological constant is actually 72 orders of
magnitudes lower than the standard estimations from quantum field theory. The
lower bound on the cosmological constant and the bounds on the Skyrme couplings
are due to the peculiar combination of nonlinear terms in the Skyrme model. It
is worth to point out that bounds on the Skyrme couplings occur in similar
fashion both for the Kantowski-Sachs and for the Bianchi-I models which are
topologically completely different. Our results suggest that this behavior is

complex networks is that in most cases, observing all nodes and all network

network data is surprisingly limited, focuses primarily on missing nodes, and
suggests that network statistics derived from subsampled data are not suitable
estimators for the same network statistics describing the overall network
topology. We generate scaling methods to predict true network statistics,
including the degree distribution, from only partial knowledge of nodes, links,
or weights. Our methods are transparent and do not assume a known generating
process for the network, thus enabling prediction of network statistics for a
wide variety of applications. We validate analytical results on four simulated
network classes and empirical data sets of various sizes. We perform
subsampling experiments by varying proportions of sampled data and demonstrate
that our scaling methods can provide very good estimates of true network
statistics while acknowledging limits. Lastly, we apply our techniques to a set
of rich and evolving large-scale social networks, Twitter reply networks. Based
on 100 million tweets, we use our scaling techniques to propose a statistical
characterization of the Twitter Interactome from September 2008 to November

rotation to different cluster properties and together with similar studies of
more GCs, we put these in the context of globular cluster formation and
evolution. Methods: We present radial velocities for 131 cluster member stars
measured from high-resolution FLAMES/GIRAFFE observations. Their membership to
the GC is additionally confirmed from precise metallicity estimates. Using this
kinematic data set we build a velocity dispersion profile and a systemic
rotation curve. Additionally, we obtain an elliptical number density profile of
NGC 4372 based on optical images using a MCMC fitting algorithm. From this we
derive the cluster's half-light radius and ellipticity as r_h=3.4'+/-0.04' and
e=0.08+/-0.01. Finally, we give a physical interpretation of the observed
morphological and kinematic properties of this GC by fitting an axisymmetric,
differentially rotating, dynamical model. Results: Our results show that NGC
4372 has an unusually high ratio of rotation amplitude to velocity dispersion
(1.2 vs. 4.5 km/s) for its metallicity. This, however, puts it in line with two
other exceptional, very metal-poor GCs - M 15 and NGC 4590. We also find a mild
flattening of NGC 4372 in the direction of its rotation. Given its old age,
this suggests that the flattening is indeed caused by the systemic rotation
rather than tidal interactions with the Galaxy. Additionally, we estimate the
dynamical mass of the GC M_dyn=2.0+/-0.5 x 10^5 M_Sun based on the dynamical
model, which constrains the mass-to-light ratio of NGC 4372 between 1.4 and 2.3

polycrystalline graphene is pronounced. Here we investigate the stitching
between grains of polycrystalline graphene, specifically, overlapping of layers
at the boundaries, grown by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) and subsequently
doped by the oxidized Cu substrate. We analyze overlapped regions between 60
and 220 nm wide via Raman spectroscopy, and find that some of these overlapped
boundaries contain AB stacked bilayers. The Raman spectra from the overlapped
grain boundaries are distinctly different from bilayer graphene and exhibit
splitting of the G band peak. The degree of splitting, peak widths, as well as
peak intensities depend on the width of the overlap. We attribute these
features to inhomogeneous doping by charge carriers (holes) across the
overlapped regions via the oxidized Cu substrate. As a result, the Fermi level
at the overlapped grain boundaries lies between 0.3 and 0.4 eV below the charge
neutrality point. Our results suggest an enhancement of electrical conductivity
across overlapped grain boundaries, similar to previously observed
measurements(1). The dependence of charge distribution on the width of
overlapping of grain boundaries may have strong implications for the growth of
large-area graphene with enhanced conductivity.

approach for developing antibiotic treatment plans that can reverse the
evolution of antibiotic resistance determinants. We have generated adaptive
landscapes for 16 genotypes of the TEM beta-lactamase that vary from the wild
type genotype TEM-1 through all combinations of four amino acid substitutions.
We determined the growth rate of each genotype when treated with each of 15
beta-lactam antibiotics. By using growth rates as a measure of fitness, we
computed the probability of each amino acid substitution in each beta-lactam
treatment using two different models named the Correlated Probability Model
(CPM) and the Equal Probability Model (EPM). We then performed an exhaustive
search through the 15 treatments for substitution paths leading from each of
the 16 genotypes back to the wild type TEM-1. We identified those treatment
paths that returned the highest probabilities of selecting for reversions of
amino acid substitutions and returning TEM to the wild type state. For the CPM
model, the optimized probabilities ranged between 0.6 and 1.0. For the EPM
model, the optimized probabilities ranged between 0.38 and 1.0. For cyclical
CPM treatment plans in which the starting and ending genotype was the wild
type, the probabilities were between 0.62 and 0.7. Overall this study shows
that there is promise for reversing the evolution of resistance through
antibiotic treatment plans.

Aspects of Programming Languages and Systems (QAPL 2014), held in Grenoble,
France, on 12 and 13 April, 2014. QAPL 2014 was a satellite event of the
European Joint Conferences on Theory and Practice of Software (ETAPS). The
central theme of the workshop is that of quantitative aspects of computation.
These aspects are related to the use of physical quantities (storage space,
time, bandwidth, etc.) as well as mathematical quantities (e.g. probability and
measures for reliability, security and trust), and play an important (sometimes
essential) role in characterising the behaviour and determining the properties
of systems. Such quantities are central to the definition of both the model of
systems (architecture, language design, semantics) and the methodologies and
tools for the analysis and verification of the systems properties. The aim of
this workshop is to discuss the explicit use of quantitative information such
as time and probabilities either directly in the model or as a tool for the
analysis of systems.

  an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck diffusion on a tree",,,,,"q-bio.PE cs.CE math.PR math.ST stat.TH","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Diffusion processes on trees are commonly used in evolutionary biology to
model the joint distribution of continuous traits, such as body mass, across
species. Estimating the parameters of such processes from tip values presents
challenges because of the intrinsic correlation between the observations
produced by the shared evolutionary history, thus violating the standard
independence assumption of large-sample theory. For instance Ho and An\'e
\cite{HoAne13} recently proved that the mean (also known in this context as
selection optimum) of an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process on a tree cannot be
estimated consistently from an increasing number of tip observations if the
tree height is bounded. Here, using a fruitful connection to the so-called
reconstruction problem in probability theory, we study the convergence rate of
parameter estimation in the unbounded height case. For the mean of the process,
we provide a necessary and sufficient condition for the consistency of the
maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) and establish a phase transition on its
convergence rate in terms of the growth of the tree. In particular we show that
a loss of $\sqrt{n}$-consistency (i.e., the variance of the MLE becomes
$\Omega(n^{-1})$, where $n$ is the number of tips) occurs when the tree growth
is larger than a threshold related to the phase transition of the
reconstruction problem. For the covariance parameters, we give a novel,
efficient estimation method which achieves $\sqrt{n}$-consistency under natural
assumptions on the tree.

compressed sensing (CS), where a fast algorithm is applied to provide partial
recovery in Part 1, and a CS algorithm is applied to complete the residual
problem in Part 2. Partitioning the reconstruction process into two
complementary parts provides a natural trade-off between runtime and
reconstruction quality. To exploit the advantages of the two-part framework, we
propose a Noisy-Sudocodes algorithm that performs two-part reconstruction of
sparse signals in the presence of measurement noise. Specifically, we design a
fast algorithm for Part 1 of Noisy-Sudocodes that identifies the zero
coefficients of the input signal from its noisy measurements. Many existing CS
algorithms could be applied to Part 2, and we investigate approximate message
passing (AMP) and binary iterative hard thresholding (BIHT). For
Noisy-Sudocodes with AMP in Part 2, we provide a theoretical analysis that
characterizes the trade-off between runtime and reconstruction quality. In a
1-bit CS setting where a new 1-bit quantizer is constructed for Part 1 and BIHT
is applied to Part 2, numerical results show that the Noisy-Sudocodes algorithm
improves over BIHT in both runtime and reconstruction quality.

the PARAFAC decomposition of a third-order tensor across a network of
collaborating nodes. We are interested in the case where the overall data
gathered across the network can be modeled as a data tensor admitting an
essentially unique PARAFAC decomposition, while each node only observes a
sub-tensor with not necessarily enough diversity so that identifiability
conditions are not locally fulfilled at each node. In this situation,
conventional (centralized) tensor based methods cannot be applied individually
at each node. By allowing collaboration between neighboring nodes of the
network, we propose distributed versions of the alternating least squares (ALS)
and Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) algorithms for the in-network estimation of the
factor matrices of a third-order tensor. We assume that one of the factor
matrices contains parameters that are local to each node, while the two
remaining factor matrices contain global parameters that are common to the
whole network. The proposed algorithms combine the estimation of the local
factors with an in-network computation of the global factors of the PARAFAC
decomposition using average consensus over graphs. They emulate their
centralized counterparts in the case of ideal data exchange and ideal consensus
computations. The performance of the proposed algorithms are evaluated in both
ideal and imperfect cases.

from a small number of linear measurements, and that this recovery can be
performed efficiently in polynomial time. The framework of model-based
compressive sensing (model-CS) leverages additional structure in the signal and
prescribes new recovery schemes that can reduce the number of measurements even
further. However, model-CS requires an algorithm that solves the
model-projection problem: given a query signal, produce the signal in the model
that is also closest to the query signal. Often, this optimization can be
computationally very expensive. Moreover, an approximation algorithm is not
sufficient for this optimization task. As a result, the model-projection
problem poses a fundamental obstacle for extending model-CS to many interesting
models.
  In this paper, we introduce a new framework that we call
approximation-tolerant model-based compressive sensing. This framework includes
a range of algorithms for sparse recovery that require only approximate
solutions for the model-projection problem. In essence, our work removes the
aforementioned obstacle to model-based compressive sensing, thereby extending
the applicability of model-CS to a much wider class of models. We instantiate
this new framework for the Constrained Earth Mover Distance (CEMD) model, which
is particularly useful for signal ensembles where the positions of the nonzero
coefficients do not change significantly as a function of spatial (or temporal)
location. We develop novel approximation algorithms for both the maximization
and the minimization versions of the model-projection problem via graph
optimization techniques. Leveraging these algorithms into our framework results
in a nearly sample-optimal sparse recovery scheme for the CEMD model.

a distinctly classical principle which, like {\it tertium non datur} $A\vee\neg

epistemic logic, is intuitionistically valid in its double negation form
$\neg\neg({\bf{K}} A\rightarrow A)$.

resolved in a constructive manner. We argue that this paradox is the result of
an unwarranted classical reading of constructive principles and as such does
not have the consequences for constructive foundations traditionally attributed

sequence, and proved that all the Hankel determinants of the period-doubling
sequence are odd integral numbers. We speak of $t$-extension when the entries
along the diagonal in the Hankel determinant are all multiplied by~$t$. Then we
prove that the $t$-extension of each Hankel determinant of the period-doubling
sequence is a polynomial in $t$, whose leading coefficient is the {\it only
one} to be an odd integral number. Our proof makes use of the combinatorial
set-up developed by Bugeaud and Han, which appears to be very suitable for this
study, as the parameter $t$ counts the number of fixed points of a permutation.
Finally, we prove that all the $t$-extensions of the Hankel determinants of the
regular paperfolding sequence are polynomials in $t$ of degree less than or
equal to $3$.

0.45<x<0.93, but not for samples with x<0.44 that exhibit incommensurate
spin-density-wave order, and in slightly overdoped samples with x=0.99. This
suggests the presence of two proximate zero-temperature CDW critical points at
doping pc1~0.08 and pc2~0.18. The CDW reflections are observed at
incommensurate in-plane wave vectors (d_a, 0) and (0, d_b). Both decrease
linearly with increasing doping, in agreement with recent reports on Bi-based
high-Tc superconductors, but in sharp contrast to the behavior of the 214
family. The CDW intensity and correlation length exhibit maxima at p~0.12,
coincident with a plateau in the superconducting transition temperature Tc. The
onset temperature of the CDW reflections depends non-monotonically on p, with a
maximum of~160 K for p~0.12. The RXS reflections exhibit a uniaxial intensity
anisotropy. We further observe a depression of CDW correlations upon cooling
below Tc, and (for samples with p> 0.09) an enhancement of the signal when an
external magnetic field up to 6 T is applied in the superconducting state. For
samples with p~0.08, where prior work has revealed a field-enhancement of
incommensurate magnetic order, the RXS signal is field-independent. This
supports a previously suggested scenario in which incommensurate charge and
spin orders compete against each other, in addition to individually competing
against. We discuss the relationship of these results to stripe order 214, the
pseudogap phenomenon, superconducting fluctuations, and quantum oscillations.

nuclear structure properties. For the description of nuclear geometric
properties, nuclear fractal dimension is an irreplaceable variable similar to
the nuclear radius. In order to determine these two variables, a new nuclear
potential energy formula which is related to the fractal dimension is put
forward and the phenomenological semi-empirical Bethe-Weizsacker binding energy
formula is modified using the fractal geometric theory. And one important
equation set with two equations is obtained, which is related to the conception
that the fractal dimension should be a dynamical parameter in the process of

mean density radii with the radii calculated by the liquid drop model for the
light stable and unstable nuclei using rational nuclear fractal structure

as well as under proton and electron irradiation. Presently available
UV-sources used for material tests do not allow the irradiation with
wavelengths smaller than about $115$ nm where common Deuterium lamps show an
intensity cut-off. The VUV-simulator generates radiation by excitation of a
gas-flow with an electron beam. The intensity of the radiation can be varied by
manipulating the gas-flow and/or the electron beam.
  The VUV simulator has been calibrated at three different gas-flow settings in
the range from $40$ nm to $410$ nm. The calibration has been made by the
Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB) in Berlin. The measured spectra
show total irradiance intensities from $24$ to $58$ mW$\rm{m^{-2}}$ (see Table
4.2) in the VUV-range, i.e. for wavelengths smaller than $200$ nm. They exhibit
a large number of spectral lines generated either by the gas-flow constituents
or by metal atoms in the residual gas which come from metals used in the source
construction. In the range from $40$ nm to $120$ nm where Deuterium lamps are
not usable, acceleration factors of $3$ to $26.3$ Solar Constants are reached
depending on the gas-flow setting. The VUV-simulator allows studies of general
degradation effects caused by photoionization and photodissociation as well as
accelerated degradation tests by use of intensities that are significantly
higher compared to that of the Sun at $1$ AU.

characterizing the scalar bi-spectrum can be expressed in terms of the scalar
spectral index in the squeezed limit, a property that is referred to as the
consistency relation. In this work, we consider the consistency relations
associated with the three-point cross-correlations involving scalars and
tensors as well as the tensor bi-spectrum in inflationary models driven by a
single, canonical, scalar field. Characterizing the cross-correlations in terms
of the dimensionless non-Gaussianity parameters $C_{_{\rm NL}}^{\mathcal R}$
and $C_{_{\rm NL}}^{\mathcal \gamma}$ that we had introduced earlier, we
express the consistency relations governing the cross-correlations as relations
between these non-Gaussianity parameters and the scalar or tensor spectral
indices, in a fashion similar to that of the purely scalar case. We also
discuss the corresponding relation for the non-Gaussianity parameter $h_{_{\rm
NL}}$ used to describe the tensor bi-spectrum. We analytically establish these
consistency relations explicitly in the following two situations: a simple
example involving a specific case of power law inflation and a non-trivial
scenario in the so-called Starobinsky model that is governed by a linear
potential with a sharp change in its slope. We also numerically verify the
consistency relations in three types of inflationary models that permit
deviations from slow roll and lead to scalar power spectra with features which
typically result in an improved fit to the data than the more conventional,
nearly scale invariant, spectra. We close with a summary of the results we have
obtained. (Abridged)

  operators: relaxation to the steady state","128 pages, 8 figures. PhD thesis",,,,"math-ph cond-mat.stat-mech math.MP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Two families of stochastic interacting particle systems, the interacting
Brownian motions and Bessel processes, are defined as extensions of Dyson's
Brownian motion models and the eigenvalue processes of the Wishart and Laguerre
processes where the parameter $\beta$ from random matrix theory is taken as a
real positive number. These are systems where several particles evolve as
individual Brownian motions and Bessel processes while repelling mutually
through a logarithmic potential. These systems are also special cases of Dunkl
processes, a broad family of multivariate stochastic processes defined by using
Dunkl operators. In this thesis, the steady state under an appropriate scaling
and and the freezing ($\beta\to\infty$) regime of the interacting Brownian
motions and Bessel processes are studied, and it is proved that the scaled
steady-state distributions of these processes converge in finite time to the
eigenvalue distributions of the $\beta$-Hermite and $\beta$-Laguerre ensembles
of random matrices. It is also shown that the scaled final positions of the
particles in these processes are fixed at the zeroes of the Hermite and
Laguerre polynomials in the freezing limit. These results are obtained as the
consequence of two more general results proved in this thesis. The first is
that Dunkl processes in general converge in finite time to a scaled
steady-state distribution that only depends on the type of Dunkl process
considered. The second is that in the freezing limit, their scaled final
position is fixed to a set of points called the peak set, which is the set of
points which maximizes their steady-state distribution.

Olver [Olver, 1974] for

$m\in\mathbb{Z}$ and $g$ continuous. Olver studies in detail the cases $m\ne
2$, specially the cases $m=0,\pm 1$, giving the Poincar\'e-type asymptotic
expansion of two independent solutions of the equation. The case $m=2$ is
different, as the behavior of the solutions for large $\Lambda$ is not of
exponential type, but of power type. In this case, Olver's theory does not give
as many details as it gives in the cases $m\ne 2$. Then, we consider here the
special case $m=2$. We propose two different techniques to handle the problem:
(i) a modification of Olver's method that replaces the role of the exponential
approximations by power approximations and (ii) the transformation of the
differential problem into a fixed point problem from which we construct an
asymptotic sequence of functions that converges to the unique solution of the
problem. Moreover, we show that this second technique may also be applied to
nonlinear differential equations with a large parameter.

Observations were carried out by the spectro-polarimeter of the Solar Optical

horizontally-oriented magnetic field formed nearly parallel to the polarity
inversion line. This flow persisted from at least 6 hours before the onset of
the flare, and continued for at least several hours after the onset of the
flare. Observations suggest that the observed material flow represents neither
the emergence nor convergence of the magnetic flux. Rather, it may be
considered to be material flow working both to increase the magnetic shear
along the polarity inversion line and to develop magnetic structures favorable
for the onset of the eruptive flare.

It is based on the Linear Quadratic Gaussian controller, but the equations are
slightly modified to account for, and to exploit, the symmetries of the

invariant approach is sensible (there is no reason why the controller
performance should depend on whether the reference trajectory is heading west
or south), we show through simulations that the ILQG outperforms the
conventional LQG controller in case of large noises or large initial
uncertainties. We show that those robustness properties may also prove useful

This sugar, mostly sucrose, has to be loaded via the bundle sheath into the
phloem vascular system (the sieve elements), where it is distributed to growing
parts of the plant. We analyze the feasibility of a particular loading
mechanism, active symplasmic loading, also called the polymer trap mechanism,
where sucrose is transformed into heavier sugars, such as raffinose and
stachyose, in the intermediary-type companion cells bordering the sieve
elements in the minor veins of the phloem. Keeping the heavier sugars from
diffusing back requires that the plasmodesmata connecting the bundle sheath
with the intermediary cell act as extremely precise filters, which are able to
distinguish between molecules that differ by less than 20% in size. In our
modeling, we take into account the coupled water and sugar movement across the
relevant interfaces, without explicitly considering the chemical reactions
transforming the sucrose into the heavier sugars. Based on the available data
for plasmodesmata geometry, sugar concentrations and flux rates, we conclude
that this mechanism can in principle function. We find that the water flow
through the plasmodesmata, which has not been quantified before, contributes
only 10-20% to the sucrose flux into the intermediary cells, while the main
part is transported by diffusion. On the other hand, the subsequent sugar
translocation into the sieve elements would very likely be carried
predominantly by bulk water flow through the plasmodesmata. Thus, in contrast
to apoplasmic loaders, all the necessary water for phloem translocation would
be supplied in this way with no need for additional water uptake across the
plasma membranes of the phloem.

Combining this model with a tidal-dominated paradigm for the formation for the
Magellanic Stream and Bridge, we reproduce the age-metallicity relations, long
gas depletion timescales, and presently observed dust and molecular hydrogen
masses of the MCs to within their respective uncertainties. We find that these
models' enrichment depends sensitively on the processing of dust within the ISM
and the dynamical influence of external tides/stellar bars. The ratio of
characteristic dust destruction timescales in our SMC and LMC models, a
governing parameter of our models' evolution, is consistent with estimates
based on observed supernova (SN) rates. Our reference MC models tend to exhibit
the disputed universal dust-to-metal ratio, which we argue stems from the
adoption of high SNe II condensation efficiencies. Our models are the first to
reproduce the one-tenth solar metallicity of the Stream/Leading Arm following
tidal stripping of the SMC; the hypothesis that the LMC contributes a
metal-rich filament to the Stream, as implied by recent kinematic and abundance
analyses, is also appraised in this study.

number of steps $N$, the optimum value of $\mu$ that maximises the foraging
efficiency can vary substantially in the interval $\mu \in (1,3)$, depending on
the landscape features (landscape size and number of targets). We further
demonstrate that subjective returning can be another significant factor that
affects the foraging efficiency in such context. Our results suggest that
L\'{e}vy-flight foraging may arise through an interaction between the
environmental context and the termination of exploitation, and particularly
that the number of steps can play an important role in this scenario which is
overlooked by most previous work. Our study not only provides a new perspective
on L\'{e}vy-flight foraging, but also opens new avenues for investigating the

scaling is very tight (the scatter is $<0.09$ dex with 90 \% probability) and
independent of cluster evolutionary status and morphology. This implies a close
association between infall and evolution of dark matter and galaxies in the
central region of clusters. We also found that the evolution of the
richness-mass intercept is minor at most, and, given the minor mass evolution
across the studied redshift range, the richness evolution of individual massive
clusters also turns out to be very small. Finally, it was paramount to account
for the cluster mass function and the selection function. Ignoring them would
led to biases larger than the (otherwise quoted) errors. Our study benefits
from: a) weak-lensing masses instead of proxy-based masses thereby removing the
ambiguity between a real trend and one induced by an accounted evolution of the

analysis thereby not requiring consideration of the unknown covariance induced

stage. We analyse high-resolution spectra of V1331 Cyg collected in 1998-2007
and 20-d series of spectra taken in 2012. For the first time the photospheric
spectrum of the star is detected and stellar parameters are derived: spectral
type G7-K0 IV, mass 2.8 Msun, radius 5 Rsun, vsini < 6 km/s. The photospheric
spectrum is highly veiled, but the amount of veiling is not the same in
different spectral lines, being lower in weak transitions and much higher in
strong transitions. The Fe II 5018, Mg I 5183, K I 7699 and some other lines of
metals are accompanied by a `shell' absorption at radial velocity of about -240
km/s. We show that these absorptions form in the post-shock gas in the jet,
i.e. the star is seen though its jet. The P Cyg profiles of H-alpha and H-beta
indicate the terminal wind velocity of about 500 km/s, which vary on
time-scales from several days to years. A model of the stellar wind is
developed to interpret the observations. The model is based on calculation of
hydrogen spectral lines using the radiative transfer code TORUS. The observed
H-alpha and H-beta line profiles and their variability can be well reproduced
with a stellar wind model, where the mass-loss rate and collimation (opening
angle) of the wind are variable. The changes of the opening angle may be
induced by small variability in magetization of the inner disc wind. The
mass-loss rate is found to vary within (6-11)x10^{-8} Msun/yr, with the
accretion rate of 2.0x10^{-6} Msun/yr.

particles in triply-periodic domains has been performed under dilute
conditions. For a single solid-to-fluid density ratio of 1.5 we have considered
two values of the Galileo number corresponding to steady vertical motion
(Ga=121) and to steady oblique motion (Ga=178) in the case of one isolated
sphere. For the multi-particle system we observe strong particle clustering
only in the latter case. The geometry and time scales related to clustering are
determined from Voronoi tesselation and particle-conditioned averaging. As a
consequence of clustering, the average particle settling velocity is increased
by 12% as compared to the value of an isolated sphere; such a collective effect
is not observed in the non-clustering case. By defining a local (instantaneous)
fluid velocity average in the vicinity of the finite-size particles it is shown
that the observed enhancement of the settling velocity is due to the fact that
the downward fluid motion (with respect to the global average) which is induced
in the cluster regions is preferentially sampled by the particles. It is
further observed that the variance of the particle velocity is strongly
enhanced in the clustering case. With the aid of a decomposition of the
particle velocity it is shown that this increase is due to enhanced fluid
velocity fluctuations (due to clustering) in the vicinity of the particles.
Finally, we discuss a possible explanation for the observation of a critical
Galileo number marking the onset of clustering under dilute conditions.

mechanisms that drive the evolution of star-planet and planet-moon systems. New
constraints are now obtained both in the Solar and exoplanetary systems. Tidal
dissipation in planets is intrinsically related to their internal structure. In
particular, fluid and solid layers behave differently under tidal forcing.
Therefore, their respective dissipation reservoirs have to be compared. In this
letter, we compute separately the contributions of the potential dense
rocky/icy core and the convective fluid envelope of gaseous giant planets, as a
function of core size and mass. We then compare the associated dissipation
reservoirs, by evaluating the frequency-average of the imaginary part of the
Love numbers $k^2_2$ in each region. In the case of Jupiter and Saturn-like
planets, we show that the viscoelastic dissipation in the core could dominate
the turbulent friction acting on tidal inertial waves in the envelope. However,

retrieval reconstruction of their diffraction patterns seem to be free from

its atomic defects can unambiguously be recovered from its diffraction pattern
alone by applying a direct phase retrieval procedure not relying on prior
information of the object shape. Individual point defects in the atomic lattice
are clearly apparent. Conventional phase retrieval routines assume isotropic
scattering. We show that when dealing with electrons, the quantitatively
correct transmission function of the sample cannot be retrieved due to
anisotropic, strong forward scattering specific to electrons. We summarize the
conditions for this phase retrieval method and show that the diffraction
pattern can be extrapolated beyond the original record to even reveal formerly
not visible Bragg peaks. Such extrapolated wave field pattern leads to enhanced
spatial resolution in the reconstruction.

and X-ray data were used for this study. The total X-ray brightness over active
regions is well correlated with integrated magnetic quantities such as the
total unsigned magnetic flux, the total unsigned vertical current, and the
area-integrated square of the vertical and horizontal magnetic fields. On
accounting for the inter-dependence of the magnetic quantities, we inferred
that the total magnetic flux is the primary determinant of the observed
integrated X-ray brightness. Our observations indicate that a stronger coronal
X-ray flux is not related to a higher non-potentiality of active-region
magnetic fields. The data even suggest a slightly negative correlation between
X-ray brightness and a proxy of active-region non-potentiality. Although there
are small numerical differences in the established correlations, the main
conclusions are qualitatively consistent over two different X-ray filters, the
Al-poly and Ti-poly filters, which confirms the strength of our conclusions and
validate and extend earlier studies that used low-resolution data. We discuss
the implications of our results and the constraints they set on theories of

functional which accounts for nonlocal interactions. Our choice is motivated by
the work of Giacomin and Lebowitz who showed that the rigorous physical
derivation of the Cahn-Hilliard equation leads to consider nonlocal
functionals. The equations also have a transport term with a given velocity
field and are subject to a homogenous Neumann boundary condition for the
chemical potential, i.e., the first variation of the free energy functional. We
first establish the well-posedness of the corresponding initial and boundary
value problems in a weak setting. Then we consider such problems as dynamical
systems and we show that they have bounded absorbing sets and global
attractors.

technologies that provide unconditionally secure communication. In parallel,
the quantum nature of the transverse electromagnetic field has spawned the
field of quantum imaging that encompasses technologies such as quantum ghost
imaging and high-dimensional quantum key distribution (QKD). The emergence of
such quantum technologies also highlights the need for the development of
methods for characterizing the elusive quantum state itself. In this document,
we describe new technologies that use the quantum properties of light for
security. The first is a technique that extends the principles behind QKD to
the field of imaging. By applying the polarization-based BB84 protocol to
individual photons in an active imaging system, we obtained images that are
secure against intercept-resend jamming attacks. The second technology
presented in this article is based on an extension of quantum ghost imaging. We
used a holographic filtering technique to build a quantum ghost image
identification system that uses a few pairs of photons to identify an object
from a set of known objects. The third technology addressed in this document is
a high-dimensional QKD system that uses orbital-angular-momentum (OAM) modes of
light for encoding. Moving to a high-dimensional state space in QKD allows one
to impress more information on each photon, as well as introduce higher levels
of security. We discuss the development of two OAM-QKD protocols based on the
BB84 and Ekert QKD protocols. The fourth and final technology presented in this
article is a relatively new technique called direct measurement that uses
sequential weak and strong measurements to characterize a quantum state. We use
this technique to characterize the quantum state of a photon with a
dimensionality of d=27, and measure its rotation in the natural basis of OAM.

the deceleration approximately proportional to the exponential of the velocity.

the tree-level L\""{u}scher-Weisz action, which is found to reduce the
deceleration by an order of magnitude, and to increase the string speed limit

for solving continuous optimization problems. Although this technique is widely

still limited. We present the first substantial experimental investigation of
the influence of the local attractor on the quality of exploration and
exploitation. We compare in detail classical PSO with the social-only variant
where local attractors are ignored. To measure the exploration capabilities, we
determine how frequently both variants return results in the neighborhood of
the global optimum. We measure the quality of exploitation by considering only
function values from runs that reached a search point sufficiently close to the
global optimum and then comparing in how many digits such values still deviate
from the global minimum value. It turns out that the local attractor
significantly improves the exploration, but sometimes reduces the quality of
the exploitation. As a compromise, we propose and evaluate a hybrid PSO which
switches off its local attractors at a certain point in time. The effects
mentioned can also be observed by measuring the potential of the swarm.

However, the reaction of HCN with H3+ followed by DR of HCNH+ acts to isomerize
HCN into HNC when carbon atoms and CO are depleted leading to a HCN/HNC ratio
close to or slightly greater than 1. This agrees well with observations in

cause of mortality in heart failure, is becoming increasingly informed by
computational simulation, numerically modelling the governing equations. This
can provide insight where experimental work is constrained by technical
limitations and/or ethical issues.
  As the models become more realistic, the construction of efficient and
accurate computational models becomes increasingly challenging. In particular,
recent developments have started to couple the electrophysiology models with
mechanical models in order to investigate the effect of tissue deformation on
arrhythmogenesis, thus introducing an element of nonlinearity into the
mathematical representation. This paper outlines a biophysically-detailed
computational model of coupled electromechanical cardiac activity which uses
the finite element method to approximate both electrical and mechanical systems
on unstructured, deforming, meshes. An ILU preconditioner is applied to improve
performance of the solver.
  This software is used to examine the role of electrophysiology, fibrosis and
mechanical deformation on the stability of spiral wave dynamics in human
ventricular tissue by applying it to models of both healthy and failing tissue.
The latter was simulated by modifying (i) cellular electrophysiological
properties, to generate an increased action potential duration and altered
intracellular calcium handling, and (ii) tissue-level properties, to simulate
the gap junction remodelling, fibrosis and increased tissue stiffness seen in
heart failure. The resulting numerical experiments suggest that, for the chosen
mathematical models of electrophysiology and mechanical response, introducing
tissue level fibrosis can have a destabilising effect on the dynamics, while
the net effect of the electrophysiological remodelling stabilises the system.

three types of eigensolution techniques; the functional analysis approach

(AIM) to solve Klein-Gordon Dirac and Schr\""odinger equations, respectively.
The energy eigenvalues and the corresponding eigenfunctions for these three

reported. It has been shown that these techniques yielded exactly same results.
some expectation values of the TW diatomic molecular potential within the
framework of the Hellmann-Feynman theorem (HFT) have been presented. The
probability distributions which characterize the quantum-mechanical states of
TW diatomic molecular potential are analysed by means of complementary
information measures of a probability distribution called the Fishers
information entropy. This distribution has been described in terms of Jacobi
polynomials, whose characteristics are controlled by the quantum numbers.

and in practice:
  - median filtering: given an $n$-element vector, compute the sliding window
median with window size $k$,
  - piecewise sorting: given an $n$-element vector, divide it in $n/k$ blocks
of length $k$ and sort each block.
  By prior work, median filtering is known to be at least as hard as piecewise
sorting: with a single median filter operation we can sort $\Theta(n/k)$ blocks
of length $\Theta(k)$. The present work shows that median filtering is also as
easy as piecewise sorting: we can do median filtering with one piecewise
sorting operation and linear-time postprocessing. In particular, median
filtering can directly benefit from the vast literature on sorting
algorithms---for example, adaptive sorting algorithms imply adaptive median
filtering algorithms.
  The reduction is very efficient in practice---for random inputs the
performance of the new sorting-based algorithm is on a par with the fastest
heap-based algorithms, and for benign data distributions it typically
outperforms prior algorithms.
  The key technical idea is that we can represent the sliding window with a
pair of sorted doubly-linked lists: we delete items from one list and add items
to the other list. Deletions are easy; additions can be done efficiently if we
reverse the time twice: First we construct the full list and delete the items
in the reverse order. Then we undo each deletion with Knuth's dancing links
technique.

observational astrophysics for nearly 100 years. Extraordinary progress has
occurred in recent years on two fronts: the cosmic distance ladder measurements
at low redshift and cosmic microwave background (CMB) measurements at high
redshift. The CMB is used to predict the current expansion rate through a
best-fit cosmological model. Complementary progress has been made with baryon
acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements at relatively low redshifts. While BAO
data do not independently determine a Hubble constant, they are important for
constraints on possible solutions and checks on cosmic consistency. A precise
determination of the Hubble constant is of great value, but it is more
important to compare the high and low redshift measurements to test our
cosmological model. Significant tension would suggest either uncertainties not
accounted for in the experimental estimates, or the discovery of new physics
beyond the standard model of cosmology. In this paper we examine in detail the
tension between the CMB, BAO, and cosmic distance ladder data sets. We find
that these measurements are consistent within reasonable statistical
expectations, and we combine them to determine a best-fit Hubble constant of
69.6+/-0.7 km/s/Mpc. This value is based upon
WMAP9+SPT+ACT+6dFGS+BOSS/DR11+H_0/Riess; we explore alternate data combinations
in the text. The combined data constrain the Hubble constant to 1%, with no
compelling evidence for new physics.

current collection in absorber materials with charge-transport limitations.
This work presents an analytical framework for assessing the ultimate
performance of non-planar solar-cells based on materials and geometry. Herein,
the physics of the p-n junction is analyzed for low-injection conditions, when
the junction can be considered spatially separable into quasi-neutral and
space-charge regions. For the conventional planar solar cell architecture,
previously established one-dimensional expressions governing charge carrier
transport are recovered from the framework established herein. Space-charge
region recombination statistics are compared for planar and non-planar
geometries, showing variations in recombination current produced from the
space-charge region. In addition, planar and non-planar solar cell performance
are simulated, based on a semi-empirical expression for short-circuit current,
detailing variations in charge carrier transport and efficiency as a function
of geometry, thereby yielding insights into design criteria for solar cell
architectures. For the conditions considered here, the expressions for
generation rate and total current are shown to universally govern any solar
cell geometry, while recombination within the space-charge region is shown to
be directly dependent on the geometrical orientation of the p-n junction.
