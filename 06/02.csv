compactified into the moduli $\bcM_g$ of Deligne-Mumford stable curves of genus

adding some mildly degenerating limits of abelian varieties. A typical case is
the moduli space of Hesse cubics. Any Hesse cubic is GIT-stable in the sense
that its $\SL(3)$-orbit is closed in the semistable locus, and conversely any
GIT-stable planar cubic is one of Hesse cubics. Similarly in arbitrary
dimension, the moduli space of abelian varieties is compactified by adding only
GIT-stable limits of abelian varieties. Our moduli space is a projective ""fine""
moduli space of possibly degenerate abelian schemes {\it with non-classical

singular schemes, called PSQASes, projectively stable quasi-abelian schemes.

These metrics are based upon different theories of entertainment in computer
games. This work also compares the entertainment value of the evolved games

entertainment value of the evolved games with the entertainment value of the
human user a human user survey is conducted. In addition to the user survey we
check the learnability of the evolved games using an artificial neural network

of strongly-correlated electrons in solids. However, since over a decade now,
variations of it are also routinely being implemented with ultracold atoms in
optical lattices. We review some of the rich literature on this subject, with a
focus on more recent non-standard forms of the Hubbard model. After an
introduction to standard (fermionic and bosonic) Hubbard models, we discuss
briefly common models for mixtures, as well as the so called extended
Bose-Hubbard models, that include interactions between neighboring sites,
next-neighboring sites, and so on. The main part of the review discusses the
importance of additional terms appearing when refining the tight-binding
approximation on the original physical Hamiltonian. Even when restricting the
models to the lowest Bloch band is justified, the standard approach neglects
the density-induced tunneling (which has the same origin as the usual on-site
interaction). The importance of these contributions is discussed for both
contact and dipolar interactions. For sufficiently strong interactions, also
the effects related to higher Bloch bands become important even for deep
optical lattices. Different approaches that aim at incorporating these effects,
mainly via dressing the basis Wannier functions with interactions, leading to
effective, density-dependent Hubbard-type models, are reviewed. We discuss also
examples of Hubbard-like models that explicitly involve higher $p$-orbitals, as
well as models that couple dynamically spin and orbital degrees of freedom.
Finally, we review mean-field nonlinear-Schr\""odinger models of the Salerno
type that share with the non-standard Hubbard models the nonlinear coupling
between the adjacent sites. In that part, discrete solitons are the main
subject of the consideration. We conclude by listing some future open problems.

Schechter mass are similarly prevalent above and below the main sequence of

component are fit by excitation from active galactic nuclei (AGN), or by a
combination of shocks and photoionization. The incidence of the most massive
galaxies with broad nuclear components is at least as large as that of AGNs
identified by X-ray, optical, infrared or radio indicators. The mass loading of
the nuclear outflows is near unity. Our findings provide compelling evidence
for powerful, high-duty cycle, AGN-driven outflows near the Schechter mass, and
acting across the peak of cosmic galaxy formation.

observations for 78 clusters lying at projected distances between Rproj ~20-140
kpc from the M31 centre. These are largely drawn from the recent PAndAS
globular cluster catalogue; 63 of our targets have no previous velocity data.
Via a Bayesian maximum likelihood analysis we find that GCs with Rproj > 30 kpc
exhibit coherent rotation around the minor optical axis of M31, in the same
direction as more centrally- located GCs, but with a smaller amplitude of
86+/-17 km s-1. There is also evidence that the velocity dispersion of the
outer halo GC system decreases as a function of projected distance from the M31
centre, and that this relation can be well described by a power law of index ~
-0.5. The velocity dispersion profile of the outer halo GCs is quite similar to
that of the halo stars, at least out to the radius up to which there is
available information on the stellar kinematics. We detect and discuss various
velocity correlations amongst subgroups of GCs that lie on stellar debris
streams in the M31 halo. Many of these subgroups are dynamically cold,
exhibiting internal velocity dispersions consistent with zero. Simple Monte
Carlo experiments imply that such configurations are unlikely to form by
chance, adding weight to the notion that a significant fraction of the outer
halo GCs in M31 have been accreted alongside their parent dwarf galaxies. We
also estimate the M31 mass within 200 kpc via the Tracer Mass Estimator,
finding (1.2 - 1.6) +/- 0.2 10^{12}M_sun. This quantity is subject to
additional systematic effects due to various limitations of the data, and
assumptions built in into the TME. Finally, we discuss our results in the

demonstrated in both laboratories and field-tests using attenuated lasers

various decoy-state MDI-QKD protocols with two or three decoy states, a clear
comparison between these protocols is still missing. This invokes the question
of how many types of decoy states are needed for practical MDI-QKD. Moreover,
the system parameters to implement decoy-state MDI-QKD are only partially
optimized in all previous works, which casts doubt on the actual performance of
former demonstrations. Here, we present analytical and numerical decoy-state
methods with one, two and three decoy states. We provide a clear comparison
among these methods and find that two decoy states already enable a near
optimal estimation and more decoy states cannot improve the key rate much in
either asymptotic or finite-data settings. Furthermore, we perform a full
optimization of system parameters and show that full optimization can
significantly improve the key rate in the finite-data setting. By simulating a
real experiment, we find that full optimization can increase the key rate by
more than one order of magnitude compared to non-optimization. A local search
method to optimize efficiently the system parameters is proposed. This method
can be four orders of magnitude faster than a trivial exhaustive search to
achieve a similar optimal key rate. We expect that this local search method

SVD cannot solve many important practical TLS problems with realistic noise
structure, such as having varying measurement noise, known structure on the

we develop convex relaxation approaches for a general class of structured TLS
(STLS). We show both theoretically and experimentally, that while the plain
nuclear norm relaxation incurs large approximation errors for STLS, the
re-weighted nuclear norm approach is very effective, and achieves better
accuracy on challenging STLS problems than popular non-convex solvers. We

inference problems are frequently encountered in many fields. Here, I develop
and apply a generative approach to network inference (RCweb) for the case when
the network is sparse and the latent (not observed) variables affect the
observed ones. From all possible factor analysis (FA) decompositions explaining
the variance in the data, RCweb selects the FA decomposition that is consistent
with a sparse underlying network. The sparsity constraint is imposed by a novel
method that significantly outperforms (in terms of accuracy, robustness to
noise, complexity scaling, and computational efficiency) Bayesian methods and
MLE methods using l1 norm relaxation such as K-SVD and l1--based sparse
principle component analysis (PCA). Results from simulated models demonstrate
that RCweb recovers exactly the model structures for sparsity as low (as
non-sparse) as 50% and with ratio of unobserved to observed variables as high
as 2. RCweb is robust to noise, with gradual decrease in the parameter ranges
as the noise level increases.

given and core spaces of graph states are introduced and discussed. A bonding

the presence or absence of a bond between two qubits unequivocally specifies
whether or not they are entangled. A physical interpretation of these bonds is
given, along with a characterization of how they can be created or destroyed by
entangling unitary operations and how they can be destroyed by local Pauli
measurements. It is shown that local unitary operations do not affect the bond

of qubits cannot change one into the other. Color multigraphs are introduced to

that the anomalous dynamics originates from an increase in the friction during

provides a way to detect whether that method has an inherent bias towards
certain tree `shapes'. For maximum parsimony, applied to a sequence of random
2-state data, each possible binary phylogenetic tree has exactly the same
distribution for its parsimony score. Despite this pleasing and slightly
surprising symmetry, some binary phylogenetic trees are more likely than others
to be a most parsimonious (MP) tree for a sequence of $k$ such characters, as
we show. For $k=2$, and unrooted binary trees on six taxa, any tree with a
caterpillar shape has a higher chance of being an MP tree than any tree with a
symmetric shape. On the other hand, if we take any two binary trees, on any
number of taxa, we prove that this bias between the two trees vanishes as the
number of characters grows. However, again there is a twist: MP trees on six
taxa are more likely to have certain shapes than a uniform distribution on
binary phylogenetic trees predicts, and this difference does not appear to
dissipate as $k$ grows.

mechanism for fractionalization in topologically ordered phases, dubbed the
string flux mechanism. The essential idea is that an anyon of a topological
phase can be endowed with fractional quantum numbers when the string attached
to it slides over a background pattern of flux in the ground state. The string
flux models that illustrate this mechanism are $Z_n$ quantum double models
defined on specially constructed $d$-dimensional lattices, and possess $Z_n$
topological order for $d \geq 2$. The models have a unitary, internal symmetry
$G$, where $G$ is an arbitrary finite group. The simplest string flux model is
a $Z_2$ toric code defined on a bilayer square lattice, where $G = Z_2$ is
layer-exchange symmetry. In general, by varying the pattern of $Z_n$ flux in
the ground state, any desired fractionalization class [element of $H^2(G,
Z_n)$] can be realized for the $Z_n$ charge excitations. While the string flux
models are not gauge theories, they map to $Z_n$ gauge theories in a certain
limit, where they follow a novel magnetic route for the emergence of low-energy
gauge structure. The models are analyzed by studying the action of $G$ symmetry
on $Z_n$ charge excitations, and by gauging the $G$ symmetry. The latter
analysis confirms that distinct fractionalization classes give rise to distinct
quantum phases, except that classes $[\omega], [\omega]^{-1} \in H^2(G, Z_n)$
give rise to the same phase. We conclude with a discussion of open issues and
future directions.

approximation, we show that each coupling constant can be recovered from a
series of total energy calculations via what we call the ``pair--flip''

computes corresponding total energy cost associated with the given exchange
constant. To test it, we apply our method to Uranium Dioxide, which is a system
known to have pseudospin $J=1$ superexchange induced dipolar, and superexchange
plus spin--lattice induced quadrupolar orderings. Our calculation reveals that
the superexchange and spin--lattice contributions to the quadrupolar exchange
interactions are about the same order with ferro-- and antiferro--magnetic
contributions, respectively. This highlights a competition rather than a
cooperation between them. Our method could be a promising tool to explore
magnetic properties of rare--earth compounds and hidden--order materials.

for the estimation of the error of a lattice rule for an integral of a
one-periodic function over the unit cube in s dimensions. The lattice rule is
randomized using independent random shifts in each coordinate direction that
are uniformly distributed in the interval [0,1]. This randomized lattice rule
results in an unbiased estimator of the multiple integral. However, in
practice, random variables that are independent and uniformly distributed on
[0,1] are not available, since this would require an infinite number of random
independent bits. A more realistic practical implementation of the Cranley and
Patterson randomization uses rs independent random bits, in the following way.
The lattice rule is randomized using independent random shifts in each
coordinate direction that are uniformly distributed on {0, 1/2^r, ...
,(2^r-1)/2^r}, where r may be large. For a rank-1 lattice rule with 2^m
quadrature points and r >= m, we show that this randomized lattice rule leads
to an estimator of the multiple integral that typically has a large bias. We
therefore propose that these rs independent random bits be used to perform a
new randomization that employs an extension, in the number of quadrature
points, to a lattice rule with 2^(m+sr) quadrature points (leading to embedded
lattice rules).This new randomization is shown to lead to an estimator of the
multiple integral that has much smaller bias.

superconductivity. An important hallmark of topological superconductors is the
existence of protected zero-energy states at surfaces or in vortex cores. Here
we investigate Majorana vortex-bound states in three-dimensional nodal and
fully gapped NCSs by combining analytical solutions of Bogoliubov-de Gennes
(BdG) equations in the continuum with exact diagonalization of BdG
Hamiltonians. We show that depending on the crystal point-group symmetries and
the topological properties of the bulk Bogoliubov-quasiparticle wave functions,
different types of zero-energy Majorana modes can appear inside the vortex
core. We find that for nodal NCSs with tetragonal point group $C_{4v}$ the
vortex states are dispersionless along the vortex line, forming one-dimensional
Majorana flat bands, while for NCSs with $D_{4}$ point-group symmetry the
vortex modes are helical Majorana states with a linear dispersion along the
vortex line. NCSs with monoclinic point group $C_2$, on the other hand, do not
exhibit any zero-energy vortex-bound states. We show that in the case of the
$C_{4v}$ ($D_4$) point group the stability of these Majorana zero modes is
guaranteed by a combination of reflection ($\pi$ rotation), time-reversal, and
particle-hole symmetry. Considering continuous deformations of the
quasiparticle spectrum in the presence of vortices, we show that the flat-band

TeV gamma rays to dozens of Megaparsecs. However, TeV photons from numerous
more distant sources have been detected. This might be interpreted, in each
particular case, in terms of hardening of the emitted spectrum caused by
presently unknown mechanisms at work in the sources. Here we show that this
interpretation is not supported by the analysis of the ensemble of all observed
sources. In the frameworks of an infrared-background model with the lowest
opacity, we reconstruct the emitted spectra of distant blazars and find that
upward spectral breaks appear precisely at those energies where absorption
effects are essential. Since these energies are very different for similar
sources located at various distances, we conclude that the breaks are artefacts
of the incorrect account of absorption and, therefore, the opacity of the
Universe for gamma rays is overestimated even in the most conservative model.
This implies that some novel physical or astrophysical phenomena should affect
long-distance propagation of gamma rays. A scenario in which a part of
energetic photons is converted to an inert new particle in the vicinity of the
source and reconverts back close to the observer does not contradict to our
results. [abridged]

greatly enhance cross-phase modulation, with the possibility of leading to
few-photon-level optical nonlinearities. This enhancement grows as the
transparency window width, \Delta_EIT, is narrowed. Decreasing \Delta_EIT,
however, increases the response time of the effect, suggesting that for pulses
of a given duration, there could be a fundamental limit to the strength of the
nonlinearity. We show that in the regimes of most practical interest - narrow
EIT windows perturbed by short signal pulses- the enhancement offered by EIT is
not only in the magnitude of the nonlinear phase shift but in fact also in its
increased duration. That is, for the case of signal pulses much shorter
(temporally) than the inverse EIT bandwidth, the narrow window serves to
prolong the effect of the passing signal pulse, leading to an integrated phase
shift that grows linearly with \Delta_EIT even though the peak phase shift may
saturate; the continued growth of the integrated phase shift improves the
detectability of the phase shift, in principle without bound. For many
purposes, it is this detectability which is of interest, more than the absolute
magnitude of the peak phase shift. We present analytical expressions based on a
linear time-invariant model that accounts for the temporal behavior of the
cross-phase modulation for several parameter ranges of interest. We conclude
that in order to optimize the detectability of the EIT-based cross-phase shift,
one should use the narrowest possible EIT window, and a signal pulse that is as
broadband as the excited state linewidth and detuned by half a linewidth.

third-nearest-neighbor Ising model and, more realistically, the
all-coordination-shell interaction model. The first model results in the
'omission' (instability) of some predicted superstructures, while the second

of interatomic-interaction energies. Even short-range interatomic interactions
provide a stability of some superstructures, while only long-range interactions

two different scenarios: (i) only the marginal $p$-values are available and
(ii) the marginal $p$-values as well as the common pairwise joint distributions

joint probabilities for outcomes. We conclusively answer, in the negative, the
very important question whether the statistics of such repeated measurements
can determine the unknown state. We quantify the notion of error in this
context as the departure of a suitably averaged density matrix from the initial
state. When the number of weak measurements is small the original state is
preserved to a great degree, but only an ensemble of such measurements, of a
complete set of observables, can determine the unknown state. By a careful
analysis of errors, it is shown that there is a precise tradeoff between errors
and \emph{invasiveness}. Lower the errors, greater the invasiveness. Though the
outcomes are not independently distributed, an analytical expression is
obtained for how averages are distributed, which is shown to be the way
outcomes are distributed in a \emph{strong measurement}. An
\emph{error-disturbance} relation, though not of the Ozawa-type, is also
derived. In the limit of vanishing errors, the invasiveness approaches what
would obtain from strong measurements.

heterostructures combining polar and nonpolar materials. In these systems, the
polar discontinuity across the interface may drive an electronic reconstruction
inducing free carriers at the interface. Here, we theoretically show that a
metallic interface between a Mott- and a band-insulator can also form in the
absence of a polar discontinuity. The condition for the appearance of such a
metallic state is consistent with the classical Mott criterion: the metallic
state is stable if the screening length falls below the effective Bohr radius
of a particle-hole pair. In this case, the metallic state bears a remarkable
similarity to the one found in polar/nonpolar heterostructures. On the other
hand, if the screening length approaches the size of the effective Bohr radius,
particles and holes are bound to each other resulting in an overall insulating
phase. We analyze this metal-insulator transition, which is tunable by the
dielectric constant, in the framework of the slave-boson mean-field theory for
a lattice model with both onsite and long-range Coulomb interactions. We
discuss ground-state properties and transport coefficients, which we derive in
the relaxation-time approximation. Interestingly, we find that the
metal-insulator transition is accompanied by a strong enhancement of the
Seebeck coefficient in the band-insulator region in the vicinity of the
interface. The implications of our theoretical findings for various

magnetic fields, acting on cold atoms in a two-dimensional lattice, has
attracted renewed interest to the problem of a quantum particle in the Hall
configuration. The present work contains a detailed analysis of the eigenstates
of this system, called Landau-Stark states, and of the associated dynamical
phenomenon of cyclotron-Bloch oscillations. It is shown that Landau-Stark
states and cyclotron-Bloch oscillations crucially depend on two factors. The
first is the orientation of the electric field relative to the primary axes of
the lattice. The second is ratio between the frequencies of Bloch and cyclotron
oscillations, that is also the ratio between the magnitudes of electric and
magnetic fields. The analysis is first carried out in the tight-binding
approximation, where the magnetic field is characterized by the Peierls phase
entering the hopping matrix elements. Agreement of this analysis with the full
quantum theory is also studied.

Reflected light from a spatially unresolved planet yields unique
insight into the overall optical properties of the planet cover. Glories are
optical phenomena caused by light that is backscattered within spherical
droplets following a narrow distribution of sizes; they are well known on Earth
as localised features above liquid clouds. Aims. Here we report the first
evidence for a glory in the disk-integrated photometry of Venus and, in turn,
of any planet. Methods. We used previously published phase curves of the planet
that were reproduced over the full range of phase angles with model predictions
based on a realistic description of the Venus atmosphere. We assumed that the
optical properties of the planet as a whole can be described by a uniform and
stable cloud cover, an assumption that agrees well with observational evidence.
Results. We specifically show that the measured phase curves mimic the
scattering properties of the Venus upper-cloud micron-sized aerosols, also at
the small phase angles at which the glory occurs, and that the glory contrast
is consistent with what is expected after multiple scattering of photons. In
the optical, the planet appears to be brighter at phase angles of 11-13 deg
than at full illumination; it undergoes a maximum dimming of up to 10 percent
at phases in between. Conclusions. Glories might potentially indicate spherical
droplets and, thus, extant liquid clouds in the atmospheres of exoplanets. A
prospective detection will require exquisite photometry at the small
planet-star separations of the glory phase angles.

Furthermore, we discuss how geometric entities from Klein's model can be
transferred to this homogeneous Clifford algebra model. Automorphic
collineations of Klein's quadric can be described by the action of the so
called sandwich operator applied to vectors $\mathfrak{v}\in\bigwedge^1 V$.
Vectors correspond to null polarities in $\mathbb{P}^3(\mathbb{R})$. We
introduce a factorization algorithm. With the help of this algorithm we are
able to factorize an arbitrary versor $\mathfrak{g}\in\mathcal{C}\ell_{(3,3)}$

When the arrival processes are non-Poisson and the service times are

interesting, and challenging.
  This paper describes a supermarket model with non-Poisson inputs: Markovian
Arrival Processes (MAPs) and with non-exponential service times: Phase-type
(PH) distributions, and provides a generalized matrix-analytic method which is
first combined with the operator semigroup and the mean-field limit. When
discussing such a more general supermarket model, this paper makes some new
results and advances as follows: (1) Providing a detailed probability analysis
for setting up an infinite-dimensional system of differential vector equations
satisfied by the expected fraction vector, where ""the invariance of environment
factors"" is given as an important result. (2) Introducing the phase-type
structure to the operator semigroup and to the mean-field limit, and a
Lipschitz condition can be obtained by means of a unified matrix-differential
algorithm. (3) The matrix-analytic method is used to compute the fixed point
which leads to performance computation of this system. Finally, we use some
numerical examples to illustrate how the performance measures of this
supermarket model depend on the non-Poisson inputs and on the non-exponential
service times. Thus the results of this paper give new highlight on
understanding influence of non-Poisson inputs and of non-exponential service

Of particular interest for the 3D heliospheric transport of energetic particles
are structures such as corotating interaction regions (CIRs), which, due to
strongly enhanced magnetic field strengths, turbulence, and associated shocks,
can act as diffusion barriers on the one hand, but also as accelerators of low
energy CRs on the other hand as well. In a two-fold series of papers we
investigate these effects by modeling inner-heliospheric solar wind conditions
with a numerical magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) setup (this paper), which will serve
as an input to a transport code employing a stochastic differential equation
(SDE) approach (second paper). In this first paper we present results from 3D
MHD simulations with our code CRONOS: for validation purposes we use analytic
boundary conditions and compare with similar work by Pizzo. For a more
realistic modeling of solar wind conditions, boundary conditions derived from
synoptic magnetograms via the Wang-Sheeley-Arge (WSA) model are utilized, where
the potential field modeling is performed with a finite-difference approach

in the magnetosheath due to a foreshock transient, most likely a Hot Flow

show that these pressure gradients caused the observed acceleration of the

molecular gas and characterize the star formation in outer disk regions as
revealed by the UV emission. We obtained deep CO(1-0) and CO(2-1) observations
on the IRAM 30 m telescope along the major axis of the M63 disk from the center
out to the galactocentric radius rgal = 1.6 r25 and over a bright UV region at
rgal = 1.36 r25. CO(1-0) is detected all along the M63 major axis out to r25,
and CO(2-1) is confined to rgal = 0.68 r25, which may betray lower excitation
temperatures in the outer disk. CO(1-0) is also detected in the external bright
UV region of M63. The radial profiles of the CO emission and of the Halpha, 24
micron, NUV and FUV star formation tracers and HI taken from the literature
show a severe drop with the galactocentric radius, such that beyond r25 they
are all absent with the exception of a faint UV emission and HI. The CO
emission detection in the external UV region, where the UV flux is higher than
the UV flux observed beyond r25, highlights a tight correlation between the CO
and UV fluxes, namely the amount of molecular gas and the intensity of star
formation. This external UV region is dominated by the atomic gas, suggesting
that HI is more likely the precursor of H2 rather than the product of UV
photodissociation. A broken power law needs to be invoked to describe the
Kennicutt-Schmidt (K-S) relation of M63 from the center of the galaxy out to
rgal = 1.36 r25. While all along the major axis out to r25 the K-S relation is
almost linear, in the external UV region the SFR regime is highly nonlinear and
characterized by a steep K-S relation and very low star formation efficiency.

discriminability because the resulting representation is strongly influenced by
frequent yet often uninformative descriptors, but only weakly influenced by
rare yet potentially highly-informative ones. Max-pooling equalizes the
influence of frequent and rare descriptors but is only applicable to

nonlinearly on the distribution of the metallic subject. In this paper, we

luminosity range, and the emission area during the bursts are known. By
analysing 246 X-ray bursts observed by the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer from 11
low-mass X-ray binaries, we find a dependence between the persistent spectral
properties and the time evolution of the black body normalisation during the
bursts. All NS atmosphere models predict that the colour-correction factor
decreases in the early cooling phase when the luminosity first drops below the
limiting Eddington value, leading to a characteristic pattern of variability in
the measured blackbody normalisation. However, the model predictions agree with
the observations for most bursts occurring in hard, low-luminosity, 'island'
spectral states, but rarely during soft, high-luminosity, 'banana' states. The
observed behaviour may be attributed to the accretion flow, which influences
cooling of the NS preferentially during the soft state bursts. This result
implies that only the bursts occurring in the hard, low-luminosity spectral
states can be reliably used for NS mass and radius determination.

generally regarded as a coincidence. This is, however, an incidental
consequence of the tidal forces from these bodies being comparable. Comparable
magnitudes implies strong temporal modulation, as the forcing frequencies are
nearly but not precisely equal. We suggest that on the basis of paleogeographic
reconstructions, in the Devonian period, when the first tetrapods appeared on
land, a large tidal range would accompany these modulated tides. This would
have been conducive to the formation of a network of isolated tidal pools,
lending support to A.S. Romer's classic idea that the evaporation of shallow
pools was an evolutionary impetus for the development of chiridian limbs in
aquatic tetrapodomorphs. Romer saw this as the reason for the existence of
limbs, but strong selection pressure for terrestrial navigation would have been
present even if the limbs were aquatic in origin. Since even a modest
difference in the Moon's angular size relative to the Sun's would lead to a
qualitatively different tidal modulation, the fact that we live on a planet
with a Sun and Moon of close apparent size is not entirely coincidental: it may
have an anthropic basis.

  It focussed on computational and combinatorial questions regarding
triangulations, with the goal of bringing together researchers working on
various aspects of triangulations and of fostering a closer collaboration
within the computational geometry and topology community.
  Triangulations are highly suitable for computations due to their clear
combinatorial structure. As a consequence, they have been successfully employed
in discrete algorithms to solve purely theoretical problems in a broad variety
of mathematical research areas (knot theory, polytope theory, 2- and 3-manifold
topology, geometry, and others). However, due to the large variety of
applications, requirements vary from field to field and thus different types of
triangulations, different tools, and different frameworks are used in different
areas of research. This is why today closely related research areas are
sometimes largely disjoint leaving potential reciprocal benefits unused.
  To address these potentials a workshop on Triangulations was held at
Oberwolfach Research Institute in 2012. Since then many new collaborations
between researchers of different mathematical communities have been
established. Regarding the computational geometry community, the theory of
manifolds continues to contribute to advances in more applied areas of the
field. Many researchers are interested in fundamental mathematical research
about triangulations and thus will benefit from a broad set of knowledge about
different research areas using different techniques.
  We hope that this workshop brought together researchers from many different
fields of computational geometry to have fruitful discussions which will lead
to new interdisciplinary collaborations and solutions.

determines the characteristic mass scale and distribution for the first and
second generations of stars forming in our Universe. Here, we present a
comprehensive investigation assessing the relative impact of metals and
magnetic fields, which may both be present during low-metallicity star
formation. We show that the presence of magnetic fields generated via the
small-scale dynamo stabilises the protostellar disc and provides some degree of
support against fragmentation. In the absence of magnetic fields, the
fragmentation timescale in our model decreases by a factor of ~10 at the
transition from Z=0 to Z>0, with subsequently only a weak dependence on
metallicity. Similarly, the accretion timescale of the cluster is set by the
large-scale dynamics rather than the local thermodynamics. In the presence of
magnetic fields, the primordial disc can become completely stable, therefore
forming only one central fragment. At Z>0, the number of fragments is somewhat
reduced in the presence of magnetic fields, though the shape of the mass
spectrum is not strongly affected in the limits of the statistical
uncertainties. The fragmentation timescale, however, increases by roughly a
factor of 3 in the presence of magnetic fields. Indeed, our results indicate
comparable fragmentation timescales in primordial runs without magnetic fields
and Z>0 runs with magnetic fields.

interacting with microwave radiation. However, recent and ongoing experiments

study this type of system. We find that the multiple coupling points give rise
to a frequency dependence in the coupling strength between the atom and its

is given by the discrete Fourier transform of the coupling point coordinates

The supermassive black hole, Sagittarius (Sgr) A*, in the centre of
our Galaxy has the largest angular size in the sky among all astrophysical
black holes. Its shadow, assuming no rotation, spans ~ 50 microarcsec.
Resolving such dimensions has long been out of reach for astronomical
instruments until a new generation of interferometers being operational during
this decade. Of particular interest is the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) with
resolution ~ 20 microarcsec in the millimeter-wavelength range 0.87 mm - 1.3
mm. Aims. We investigate the ability of the fully general relativistic
Komissarov (2006) analytical magnetized torus model to account for observable
constraints at Sgr A* in the centimeter and millimeter domains. The impact of
the magnetic field geometry on the observables is also studied. Methods. We
calculate ray-traced centimeter- and millimeter-wavelength synchrotron spectra
and images of a magnetized accretion torus surrounding the central black hole
in Sgr A*. We assume stationarity, axial symmetry, constant specific angular
momentum and polytropic equation of state. A hybrid population of thermal and
non-thermal electrons is considered. Results. We show that the torus model is
capable of reproducing spectral constraints in the millimeter domain, and in
particular in the observable domain of the EHT. However, the torus model is not
yet able to fit the centimeter spectrum. 1.3 mm images at high inclinations are
in agreement with observable constraints. Conclusions. The ability of the torus
model to account for observations of Sgr A* in the millimeter domain is
interesting in the perspective of the future EHT. Such an analytical model
allows very fast computations. It will thus be a suitable test bed for
investigating large domains of physical parameters, as well as non-black-hole
compact object candidates and alternative theories of gravity.

modularity and nestedness, which indicate ecosystem stability, species
diversity, and connectance. Such structure-stability relationships are well
known. However, another important perspective is less well understood: the
relationship between the environment and structure. Inspired by theoretical
studies that suggest that network structure can change due to environmental
variability, we collected data on a number of empirical food webs and
mutualistic networks and evaluated the effect of climatic seasonality on
ecological network structure. As expected, we found that climatic seasonality
affects ecological network structure. In particular, an increase in modularity
due to climatic seasonality was observed in food webs; however, it is debatable
whether this occurs in mutualistic networks. Interestingly, the type of
climatic seasonality that affects network structure differs with ecosystem
type. Rainfall and temperature seasonality influence freshwater food webs and
mutualistic networks, respectively; food webs are smaller, and more modular,
with increasing rainfall seasonality. Mutualistic networks exhibit a higher
diversity (particularly of animals) with increasing temperature seasonality.
These results confirm the theoretical prediction that stability increases with
greater perturbation. Although these results are still debatable because of
several limitations in the data analysis, they may enhance our understanding of
environment-structure relationships.

problems on embedded systems. The class of problems addressed corresponds to
ordinary differential equations (ODEs) with generalized linear constraints,
whereby the data from an array of sensors forms the forcing function. The
solution of the equation is formulated as a least squares (LS) problem with
linear constraints. The LS approach makes the method suitable for the explicit
solution of inverse problems where the forcing function is perturbed by noise.
The algebraic computation is partitioned into a initial preparatory step, which
precomputes the matrices required for the run-time computation; and the cyclic
run-time computation, which is repeated with each acquisition of sensor data.
The cyclic computation consists of a single matrix-vector multiplication, in
this manner computation complexity is known a-priori, fulfilling the definition
of a real-time computation. Numerical testing of the new method is presented on
perturbed as well as unperturbed problems; the results are compared with known
analytic solutions and solutions acquired from state-of-the-art implicit
solvers. The solution is implemented with model based design and uses only
fundamental linear algebra; consequently, this approach supports automatic code
generation for deployment on embedded systems. The targeting concept was tested
via software- and processor-in-the-loop verification on two systems with
different processor architectures. Finally, the method was tested on a
laboratory prototype with real measurement data for the monitoring of flexible
structures. The problem solved is: the real-time overconstrained reconstruction
of a curve from measured gradients. Such systems are commonly encountered in
the monitoring of structures and/or ground subsidence.

operational risk capital they must hold using an Advanced Measurement Approach
(AMA) as defined by the Basel II/III Accords. Most use the Loss Distribution
Approach (LDA) which defines the aggregate loss distribution as the convolution
of a frequency and a severity distribution representing the number and
magnitude of losses, respectively. Estimated capital is a Value-at-Risk (99.9th
percentile) estimate of this annual loss distribution. In practice, the
severity distribution drives the capital estimate, which is essentially a very
high quantile of the estimated severity distribution. Unfortunately, because
the relevant severities are heavy-tailed AND the quantiles being estimated are
so high, VaR always appears to be a convex function of the severity parameters,
causing all widely-used estimators to generate biased capital estimates
(apparently) due to Jensen's Inequality. The observed capital inflation is
sometimes enormous, even at the unit-of-measure (UoM) level (even billions
USD). Herein I present an estimator of capital that essentially eliminates this
upward bias. The Reduced-bias Capital Estimator (RCE) is more consistent with
the regulatory intent of the LDA framework than implementations that fail to
mitigate this bias. RCE also notably increases the precision of the capital
estimate and consistently increases its robustness to violations of the i.i.d.
data presumption (which are endemic to operational risk loss event data). So
with greater capital accuracy, precision, and robustness, RCE lowers capital
requirements at both the UoM and enterprise levels, increases capital stability
from quarter to quarter, ceteris paribus, and does both while more accurately
and precisely reflecting regulatory intent. RCE is straightforward to implement
using any major statistical software package.

II) testing the sensitivity of the results to the model parameters. We find
that, associated to the onset of the different hyperonic families, up to three
separate strangeness-driven phase transitions may occur. Consequently, a large
fraction of the baryonic density domain is covered by phase coexistence with
potential relevance for (proto)-neutron star evolution. It is shown that the
presence of a phase transition is compatible both with the observational
constraint on the maximal neutron star mass, and with the present experimental
information on hypernuclei. In particular we show that two solar mass neutron
stars are compatible with important hyperon content. Still, the parameter space
is too large to give a definitive conclusion of the possible occurrence of a
strangeness driven phase transition, and further constraints from
multiple-hyperon nuclei and/or hyperon diffusion data are needed.

the loop studies based on a classical parallel-cascade scenario originally
proposed in the solar wind context by considering the effects of loop
expansion, and perform a parametric study to directly contrast the computed
loop densities and electron temperatures with those measured by TRACE and
YOHKOH/SXT. This comparison yields that with the wave amplitudes
observationally constrained by SUMER measurements, while the computed loops may
account for a significant fraction of SXT loops, they seem too hot when
compared with TRACE loops. Lowering the wave amplitudes does not solve this
discrepancy, introducing magnetic twist will make the comparison even less
desirable. We conclude that the nanoflare heating scenario better explains
ultraviolet loops, while turbulence-based steady heating mechanisms may be at

from many putatively independent loci collected across the genome. Among
insects, an increasingly common approach to collecting this class of data
involves transcriptome sequencing, because few insects have high-quality genome
sequences available; assembling new genomes remains a limiting factor; the
transcribed portion of the genome is a reasonable, reduced subset of the genome
to target; and the data collected from transcribed portions of the genome are
similar in composition to the types of data with which biologists have
traditionally worked (e.g., exons). However, molecular techniques requiring RNA
as a template are limited to using very high quality source materials, which
are often unavailable from a large proportion of biologically important insect
samples. Recent research suggests that DNA-based target enrichment of conserved
genomic elements offers another path to collecting phylogenomic data across
insect taxa, provided that conserved elements are present in and can be
collected from insect genomes. Here, we identify a large set (n$=$1510) of
ultraconserved elements (UCE) shared among the insect order Hymenoptera. We use
in silico analyses to show that these loci accurately reconstruct relationships
among genome-enabled Hymenoptera, and we design a set of baits for enriching
these loci that researchers can use with DNA templates extracted from a variety
of sources. We use our UCE bait set to enrich an average of 721 UCE loci from
30 hymenopteran taxa, and we use these UCE loci to reconstruct phylogenetic
relationships spanning very old ($\geq$220 MYA) to very young ($\leq$1 MYA)
divergences among hymenopteran lineages. In contrast to a recent study
addressing hymenopteran phylogeny using transcriptome data, we found ants to be

receiving individual at the expense of the acting individual is a puzzling
phenomenon. An extreme form of altruism can be found in colicinogenic E. coli.
These suicidal altruists explode, releasing colicins that kill unrelated
individuals, which are not colicin resistant. By committing suicide, the
altruist makes it more likely that its kin will have less competition. The
benefits of this strategy rely on the number of competitors and kin nearby. If
the organism explodes at an inopportune time, the suicidal act may not harm any
competitors. Communication could enable organisms to act altruistically when
environmental conditions suggest that that strategy would be most beneficial.
Quorum sensing is a form of communication in which bacteria produce a protein
and gauge the amount of that protein around them. Quorum sensing is one means
by which bacteria sense the biotic factors around them and determine when to
produce products, such as antibiotics, that influence competition. Suicidal
altruists could use quorum sensing to determine when exploding is most
beneficial, but it is challenging to study the selective forces at work in
microbes. To address these challenges, we use digital evolution (a form of
experimental evolution that uses self-replicating computer programs as
organisms) to investigate the effects of enabling altruistic organisms to
communicate via quorum sensing. We found that quorum-sensing altruists killed a
greater number of competitors per explosion, winning competitions against
non-communicative altruists. These findings indicate that quorum sensing could
increase the beneficial effect of altruism and the suite of conditions under

law at large velocity, $\alpha \sim U^{-1}$, but with different prefactors
depending on the value of $\mathrm{Bo}_D$. For small $\mathrm{Bo}_D$ (large
capillary effects), the wake angle approximately follows the law $\alpha \simeq

Isabelle/HOL system, and we have produced verified code for combinatorial
Vickrey auctions. A fundamental question in this was how to represent some
basic concepts: since set theory is available inside Isabelle/HOL, when
introducing new definitions there is often the issue of balancing the amount of
set-theoretical objects and of objects expressed using entities which are more
typical of higher order logic such as functions or lists. Likewise, a user has
often to answer the question whether to use a constructive or a
non-constructive definition. Such decisions have consequences for the proof
development and the usability of the formalization. For instance, sets are
usually closer to the representation that economists would use and recognize,
while the other objects are closer to the extraction of computational content.
In this paper we give examples of the advantages and disadvantages for these
approaches and their relationships. In addition, we present the corresponding
Isabelle library of definitions and theorems, most prominently those dealing
with relations and quotients.

reduction techniques. We describe a method to fabricate surfaces that combine
both of these techniques in order to increase drag reduction properties.
Samples have been tested with a cone-and-plate rheometer system, and have
demonstrated significant drag reduction even in the transitional-turbulent
regime. Direct Numerical Simulations have been performed in order to estimate
the equivalent slip length at higher rotational speed. The sample with
100~$\mu$m deep grooves has been performing very well, showing drag reduction
varying from 15 to 20 $\%$ over the whole range of flow conditions tested, and
its slip length was estimated to be over 100 $\mu$m.

tuned improper maximum likelihood estimator"" (OTRIMLE) for robust clustering
based on the multivariate Gaussian model for clusters, and a comprehensive
simulation study comparing the OTRIMLE to Maximum Likelihood in Gaussian
mixtures with and without noise component, mixtures of t-distributions, and the
TCLUST approach for trimmed clustering. The OTRIMLE uses an improper constant
density for modelling outliers and noise. This can be chosen optimally so that
the non-noise part of the data looks as close to a Gaussian mixture as
possible. Some deviation from Gaussianity can be traded in for lowering the
estimated noise proportion. Covariance matrix constraints and computation of
the OTRIMLE are also treated. In the simulation study, all methods are
confronted with setups in which their model assumptions are not exactly
fulfilled, and in order to evaluate the experiments in a standardized way by
misclassification rates, a new model-based definition of ""true clusters"" is
introduced that deviates from the usual identification of mixture components
with clusters. In the study, every method turns out to be superior for one or
more setups, but the OTRIMLE achieves the most satisfactory overall
performance. The methods are also applied to two real datasets, one without and
one with known ""true"" clusters.

Grothendieck-Serre's conjecture concerning principal G-bundles over regular
semi-local domains R containing a finite field (here $G$ is a reductive group
scheme). The preprint [Pan1] contains main geometric presentation theorems
which are necessary for that. The present preprint contains reduction of the
Grothendieck--Serre's conjecture to the case of semi-simple simply-connected
group schemes (see Theorem 1.0.1). The preprint [Pan3] contains a proof of that
conjecture for regular semi-local domains R containing a finite field. The
Grothendieck--Serre conjecture for the case of regular semi-local domains
containing an infinite field is proven in joint work due to R.Fedorov and
I.Panin (see [FP]). Thus the conjecture holds for regular semi-local domains
containing a field. The reduction is based on two purity results (Theorem 1.0.2
and Theorem 10.0.29).

demand by considering a finite number of realizations from a stochastic process
model for loads. Accurate evaluations of expectations or higher moments for the
quantities of interest require a prohibitively large number of model
evaluations. In this paper we propose an alternative approach based on using
surrogate models valid over the range of the forecast uncertainty. We consider
surrogate models based on Polynomial Chaos expansions, constructed using sparse
quadrature methods. Considering expected generation cost, we demonstrate the
approach can lead to several orders of magnitude reduction in computational
cost relative to using Monte Carlo sampling on the original model, for a given
target error threshold.
