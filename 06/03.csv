formation. Knowledge of this process comes from a combination of astronomical
observations and laboratory simulations under astrophysically relevant
conditions. For the first time we present the results of temperature programmed
desorption (TPD) experiments with pre-cometary ice analogs composed of up to
five molecular components: H2 O, CO, CO2, CH3 OH, and NH3 . The experiments
were performed with an ultra-high vacuum chamber. A gas line with a novel
design allows the controlled preparation of mixtures with up to five molecular
components. Volatiles desorbing to the gas phase were monitored using a
quadrupole mass spectrometer, while changes in the ice structure and
composition were studied by means of infrared spectroscopy. The TPD curves of
water ice containing CO, CO2, CH3 OH, and NH3 present desorption peaks at
temperatures near those observed in pure ice experiments, volcano desorption
peaks after water ice crystallization, and co-desorption peaks with water.
Desorption peaks of CH3 OH and NH3 at temperatures similar to the pure ices
takes place when their abundance relative to water is above 3%, approx., in the
ice matrix. We found that CO, CO2, and NH3 also present co-desorption peaks
with CH3 OH, which cannot be reproduced in experiments with binary water-rich
ice mixtures. These are extensively used in the study of thermal desorption of
interstellar ices. These results reproduce the heating of circumstellar ices in
hot cores and can be also applied to the late thermal evo- lution of comets. In
particular, TPD curves represent a benchmark for the analysis of the
measurements that mass spectrometers on board the ESA-Rosetta cometary mission
will perform on the coma of comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, which will be
active before the arrival of Rosetta according to our predictions.

consistent with d-separation in a classical limit. We note that the resulting

stronger than quantum mechanics, such as the Popescu-Rorlich box.

bit-flip channels. We analyze quantitatively the effects of noise using two
common information-theoretic measures of probability distribution
distinguishability: the fidelity and the relative entropy. In particular, we
discuss the optimal cheating strategy and show that it is always advantageous
for a cheating agent to add some amount of white noise - the particular effect
not being present in standard quantum security protocols. We also analyze the

high-level functionalities such as SQL, schemas, indexes, and transactions that
do not exist in the O/S file system. But, a recent advent of big data
technology facilitates development of new systems that sacrifice the DBMS
functionality in order to efficiently manage large-scale data. Those so-called
NoSQL systems use a distributed file system, which support scalability and
reliability. They support scalability of the system by storing data into a
large number of low-cost commodity hardware and support reliability by storing
the data in replica. However, they have a drawback that they do not adequately
support high-level DBMS functionality. In this paper, we propose an
architecture of a DBMS that uses the DFS as storage. With this novel
architecture, the DBMS is capable of supporting scalability and reliability of
the DFS as well as high-level functionality of DBMS. Thus, a DBMS can utilize a
virtually unlimited storage space provided by the DFS, rendering it to be
suitable for big data analytics. As part of the architecture of the DBMS, we
propose the notion of the meta DFS file, which allows the DBMS to use the DFS
as the storage, and an efficient transaction management method including
recovery and concurrency control. We implement this architecture in
Odysseus/DFS, an integration of the Odysseus relational DBMS, that has been
being developed at KAIST for over 24 years, with the DFS. Our experiments on
transaction processing show that, due to the high-level functionality of
Odysseus/DFS, it outperforms Hbase, which is a representative open-source NoSQL
system. We also show that, compared with an RDBMS with local storage, the
performance of Odysseus/DFS is comparable or marginally degraded, showing that
the overhead of Odysseus/DFS for supporting scalability by using the DFS as the
storage is not significant.

the spatial extent of nuclear spin-polarization to within a Bohr radius of the
donor sites and is directly responsible for the isotope dependence of the
measured NMR signal amplitude. The hyperfine interaction is also responsible
for the $2\text{ kHz}$ Knight shift of the nuclear resonance frequency that is

shown to provide a measurement of the electron spin-polarization that agrees
qualitatively with standard spin transport measurements.

leads to a shrinkage-type estimator which is distribution-free and it is
optimal in the sense of minimizing the out-of-sample variance. Its asymptotic
properties are investigated assuming that the number of assets $p$ depends on
the sample size $n$ such that $\frac{p}{n}\rightarrow c\in (0,+\infty)$ as $n$
tends to infinity. The results are obtained under weak assumptions imposed on
the distribution of the asset returns, namely it is only required the fourth
moments existence. Furthermore, we make no assumption on the upper bound of the
spectrum of the covariance matrix. As a result, the theoretical findings are
also valid if the dependencies between the asset returns are described by a
factor model which appears to be very popular in financial literature nowadays.
This is also well-documented in a numerical study where the small- and
large-sample behavior of the derived estimator are compared with existing
estimators of the GMV portfolio. The resulting estimator shows significant
improvements and it turns out to be robust to the deviations from normality.

combination of soft tools from Banach space theory ($s$-numbers, type and

interpolation method for $\Ht$, developed in an earlier paper, using estimates
of solutions of the $\overline{\partial}$ equation. A transference principle
from $H^p$ of the unit disc is discussed, leading to explicit examples of
compact composition operators on $\Ho$ with approximation numbers decaying at a
variety of sub-exponential rates. Finally, a new Littlewood--Paley formula is

stars moving in the meridional $(R,z)$ plane of an axially symmetric
time-independent disk galaxy model with a central massive nucleus and an
additional spherical dark matter halo component. In particular, we try to
reveal the influence of the scale length of the dark matter halo on the
different families of orbits of stars, by monitoring how the percentage of
chaotic orbits, as well as the percentages of orbits of the main regular
resonant families evolve when this parameter varies. The smaller alignment
index (SALI) was computed by numerically integrating the equations of motion as
well as the variational equations to extensive samples of orbits in order to
distinguish safely between ordered and chaotic motion. In addition, a method
based on the concept of spectral dynamics that utilizes the Fourier transform
of the time series of each coordinate is used to identify the various families
of regular orbits and also to recognize the secondary resonances that bifurcate
from them. Our numerical computations reveal that when the dark matter halo is
highly concentrated, that is when the scale length has low values the vast
majority of star orbits move in regular orbits, while on the other hand in less
concentrated dark matter halos the percentage of chaos increases significantly.
We also compared our results with early related work.

$\text{Ge}_{1-y}\text{Sn}_{y}$ has been determined from room-temperature
photoluminescence measurements. This technique is particularly attractive for a
comparison of the two transitions because distinct features in the spectra can
be associated with the direct and indirect gaps. However, detailed modeling of
these room temperature spectra is required to extract the band gap values with
the high accuracy required to determine the Sn concentration $y_{c}$ at which
the alloy becomes a direct gap semiconductor. For the direct gap, this is
accomplished using a microscopic model that allows the determination of direct
gap energies with meV accuracy. For the indirect gap, it is shown that current
theoretical models are inadequate to describe the emission properties of
systems with close indirect and direct transitions. Accordingly, an ad hoc
procedure is used to extract the indirect gap energies from the data. For $y$ <
0.1 the resulting direct gap compositional dependence is given by $\Delta E_{0}
= -(3.57 \pm 0.06)y$ (in eV). For the indirect gap, the corresponding
expression is $\Delta E_{\text{ind}} = -(1.64\pm 0.10)y$ (in eV). If a
quadratic function of composition is used to express the two transition
energies over the entire compositional range $0 \leq y \leq 1$, the quadratic
(bowing) coefficients are found to be $b_{0} = 2.46 \pm 0.06$ eV (for $E_{0}$)
and $b_{\text{ind}} = 0.99 \pm 0.11$ eV (for $E_{\text{ind}}$). These results
imply a crossover concentration $y_{c} = 0.073_{-0.006}^{+0.007}$, much lower
than early theoretical predictions based on the virtual crystal approximation,
but in better agreement with predictions based on large atomic supercells.

methods of finite difference and splines are reviewed in detail. The former has
the advantage of simplicity and low computational cost, but its estimates are
prone to a variety of errors due to discretization. The latter eliminates all
issues related to discretization and incorporates a regularization mechanism to
reduce spatial noise, but at the cost of increasing mathematical and
computational complexity. These and several others issues deserving further
development are highlighted, some of which we address to the extent possible.
Here we develop a set of discrete approximations for Laplacian estimates at
peripheral electrodes and a possible solution to the problem of multiple-frame
regularization. We also provide the mathematical details of finite difference
approximations that are missing in the literature, and discuss the problem of
computational performance, which is particularly important in the context of
EEG splines where data sets can be very large. Along this line, the matrix
representation of the surface Laplacian operator is carefully discussed and
some figures are given illustrating the advantages of this approach. In the

setting, the analogous plane curve is a quartic with two singularities at
infinity, so the genus is still 1. We can add points geometrically by realizing
the quartic as the intersection of two quadric surfaces. This allows us to
construct nontrivial examples of rational hyperbolic triangles having the same
inradius and perimeter as a given rational right hyperbolic triangle.

problem of a discrete system weakly coupled to an environment of harmonic
oscillators. Our approach is based on a phase space representation of the
density matrix for a system coupled to a two-tiered environment. The dynamics
of the system and its immediate environment are resolved in a non-Markovian
way, and the environmental modes of the inner environment can themselves be
damped by a wider `universe'. Applying our approach to the canonical cases of
the Rabi and spin-boson models we obtain new analytical expressions for an
effective thermalisation temperature and corrections to the environmental
response functions as direct consequences of considering such a tiered
environment. A comparison with exact numerical simulations confirms that our
approximate expressions are remarkably accurate, while their analytic nature
offers the prospect of deeper understanding of the physics which they describe.
A unique advantage of our method is that it permits the simultaneous inclusion
of a continuous bath as well as discrete environmental modes, leading to wide
and versatile applicability.

spectrum of the associated Fokker-Planck operator has the form $(n+m\mu)\nu$
where $\nu$ is the force constant characterizing the well, and
$n,m\in\mathbb{N}$. If $\mu$ is irrational, the eigenvalues are all
non-degenerate, but rational $\mu$ can lead to degeneracy. The maximum
degeneracy is shown to be two. The left eigenfunctions of the fractional
Fokker-Planck operator are very simple while the right eigenfunctions may be
obtained from the lowest eigenfunction by a combination of two different

gross inconsistency between theoretical expectations and cosmological
observations of the vacuum energy density, by at least 60 orders of magnitude,
otherwise known as the \textit{cosmological constant problem}. A characteristic
feature of vacuum energy is that it has a pressure with the same amplitude, but
opposite sign to its energy density, while all the precision tests of General
Relativity are either in vacuum, or for media with negligible pressure.
Therefore, one may wonder whether an anomalous coupling to pressure might be
responsible for decoupling vacuum from gravity. We test this possibility in the
context of the \textit{Gravitational Aether} proposal, using current
cosmological observations, which probe the gravity of relativistic pressure in
the radiation era. Interestingly, we find that the best fit for anomalous
pressure coupling is about half-way between General Relativity (GR), and
Gravitational Aether (GA), if we include \textit{Planck} together with
\textit{WMAP} and BICEP2 polarization cosmic microwave background (CMB)
observations. Taken at face value, this data combination excludes both GR and
GA at around the 3-sigma level. However, including higher resolution CMB
observations (""highL"") or baryonic acoustic oscillations (BAO) pushes the best
fit closer to GR, excluding the Gravitational Aether solution to the
cosmological constant problem at the 4--5-sigma level. This constraint
effectively places a limit on the anomalous coupling to pressure in the
parametrized post-Newtonian (PPN) expansion, $\zeta_4 = 0.105 \pm 0.049$
(+highL CMB), or $\zeta_4 = 0.066 \pm 0.039$ (+BAO). These represent the most
precise measurement of this parameter to date, indicating a mild tension with
GR (for $\Lambda$CDM including tensors, with $\zeta_4=0$), and also among
different data sets.

$\Lambda{\rm CDM}$, the Galileon model constraints are compatible with local
determinations of the Hubble parameter and predict nonzero neutrino masses at

lensing spectrum may be able to distinguish between $\Lambda{\rm CDM}$ and
Galileon models. In the Cubic model, the lensing potential deepens at late
times on sub-horizon scales, which is at odds with the current observational
suggestion of a positive ISW effect. Compared to $\Lambda$CDM, the Quartic and
Quintic models predict less ISW power in the low-$l$ region of the CMB
temperature spectrum, and as such are slightly preferred by the Planck data. We
illustrate that residual local modifications to gravity in the Quartic and

However, despite deep optical and near-infrared searches with SOAR and the Keck
telescopes we have not discovered the optical counterpart of the system. This
is consistent with the white dwarf hypothesis only if the effective temperature
is <3000 K, a limit that is robust to distance, mass, and atmosphere
uncertainties. This would make the companion to PSR J2222-0137 one of the
coolest white dwarfs ever observed. For the implied age to be consistent with
the age of the Milky Way requires the white dwarf to have already crystallized
and entered the faster Debye-cooling regime.

This charge effect was investigated using spin density functional theory

that hole-doping can apparently increase both Fe-adatom diffusion barrier and
Fe inter-adatom repulsion energy occurring at intermediate separation, whereas
electron-doping can decrease Fe-adatom diffusion barrier but only slightly
modify inter-adatom repulsion energy. Further kinetic Monte Carlo simulation

and astrometric information of the wide-orbit component of Cepheid stars. Such

model-independent distances and masses. Methods: We used the NAOS-CONICA
adaptive optics instrument (NACO) in the near-infrared to perform a deep search
for wide components around the classical Cepheids, Y~Oph, FF~Aql, X~Sgr, W~Sgr,
and $\eta$~Aql, within a field of view (FoV) of $1.7""\times 1.7""$ ($3.4""\times

detect a secondary modulation cycle with a period of approximately 5300 days or

spatial scales of $(0.5$-$1.0)$ $h^{-1}$ Mpc to define the cosmic web. We find
that the halo shape presents the strongest alignment along the smallest tidal
eigenvector, e.g. along filaments and walls, with a signal that gets stronger
as the halo mass increases. In the case of the velocity shear field only
massive halos $>10^{12}$ $h^{-1}$$M_{\odot}$ tend to have their shapes aligned
along the largest tidal eigenvector; that is, perpendicular to filaments and
walls. For the angular momentum we find alignment signals only for halos more

webs where the preferences are for it to be parallel to the middle eigenvector;
perpendicular to filaments and parallel to walls. Finally, the peculiar

We find a tentative correlation between detected C IV absorption strength and
star formation, paralleling the strong correlation seen in highly ionized
oxygen for L~L* galaxies by the COS-Halos survey. The data imply a large carbon
reservoir in the CGM of these galaxies, corresponding to a minimum carbon mass
of $\gtrsim$ 1.2$\times 10^6$ $M_\odot$ out to ~ 110 kpc. This mass is
comparable to the carbon mass in the ISM and more than the carbon mass

with sufficient data (NGC 185 and And II). There is only tentative evidence for
an alpha abundance radial gradient in NGC 185. We homogeneously compare our
results to the Milky Way classical dwarf spheroidals, finding evidence for
wider variation in average alpha abundance. In the absence of chemical
abundances for the M 31 stellar halo, we compare to the Milky Way stellar halo.
A stellar halo comprised of disrupted M31 satellites is too metal-rich and
inconsistent with the Milky Way halo alpha abundance distribution even if
considering only satellites with predominantly old stellar populations. The M
31 satellite population provides a second system in which to study chemical
abundances of dwarf galaxies and reveals a wider variety of abundance patterns
than the Milky Way.

context of thermal surface radiation from a rotating neutron star, a
conventional polar cap model can reproduce the broad, large-amplitude X-ray
pulse only with a ""pencil plus fan"" beam emission pattern, which is
characteristic of strongly magnetized ($\gtrsim$10^12 Gauss) neutron star
atmospheres, substantially stronger than the ~10^10 Gauss external dipole field
inferred from the pulsar spin-down rate. This discrepancy can be explained by
an axially displaced dipole. For other beaming patterns, it is necessary to
invoke high-aspect-ratio emitting regions that are greatly longitudinally
elongated, possibly due to an extremely offset dipole. For all assumed emission
models, the existence of strong internal magnetic fields ($\gtrsim$10^14}
Gauss) that preferentially channel internal heat to only a portion of the
exterior is required to account for the implied high-temperature contrast
across the stellar surface. This lends further observational evidence in
support of the ""hidden"" strong magnetic field scenario, in which CCOs possess
strong submerged magnetic fields that are substantially stronger than the
external dipole field, presumably due to burial by fallback of supernova
ejecta. I also conduct phase-resolved X-ray spectroscopy and find no evidence

  In this paper, we propose a continuous-time probabilistic model, based on

products, where the frequency of use of one product can be modulated by those
of others. This model allows us to efficiently simulate the adoption and
recurrent usages of competing products, and generate traces in which we can
easily recognize the effect of social influence, recency and competition. We
then develop an inference method to efficiently fit the model parameters by
solving a convex program. The problem decouples into a collection of smaller
subproblems, thus scaling easily to networks with hundred of thousands of
nodes. We validate our model over synthetic and real diffusion data gathered
from Twitter, and show that the proposed model does not only provides a good

provides interpretable model parameters, which allow us to gain insights into

of planet pairs with period ratios just wide of a mean motion resonance (MMR)
and a dearth of systems just narrow of them. Traditional planet formation
models are at odds with these observations. They are also in contrast with the
period ratios of radial-velocity-discovered multi-planet systems which tend to
pile up at 2:1 MMR. We propose that gas-disk migration traps planets in a MMR.
After gas dispersal, orbits of these trapped planets are altered through
interaction with a residual planetesimal disk. We study the effects of
planetesimal disk interactions on planet pairs trapped in 2:1 MMR using planets
of mass typical of the Kepler planet candidates (KPC) and explore large ranges
for the mass, and density profile of the planetesimal disk. We find that
planet-planetesimal disk interactions naturally create the observed asymmetry
in period-ratio distribution for large ranges of planetesimal disk and planet
properties. If the planetesimal disk mass is above a threshold of ~0.2x the
planet mass, these interactions typically disrupt MMR. Afterwards, the planets
migrate in such a way that the final period-ratio is slightly higher than the
integer ratio corresponding to the initial MMR. Below this threshold these
interactions typically cannot disrupt the resonance and the period ratio stays
close to the integer ratio. The threshold explains why the more massive planet
pairs found by RV surveys are still in resonance. We encourage future research
to explore how significantly the associated accretion would change the planets'
atmospheric and surface properties.

general, halos with circular velocities comparable to the magnitude of kick
velocity are most strongly affected by decays. We show that decaying dark
matter models with lifetimes comparable to Hubble time and recoil speeds about
20-40 km/s can significantly reduce both the abundance of Galactic subhalos and
the internal densities of the subhalos. We also compare subhalo circular
velocity profiles with observational constraints on the Milky Way dwarf
satellite galaxies. Interestingly, we find that decaying dark matter models
that do not violate current astrophysical constraints, can significantly
mitigate both the well-documented ""missing satellites problem"" and the more
recent ""too big to fail problem"" associated with the abundances and densities
of Local Group dwarf satellite galaxies. A relatively unique feature of late
decaying dark matter models is that they predict significant evolution of halos
as a function of time. This is an important consideration because at high
redshifts, prior to decays, decaying models exhibit the same sequence of
structure formation as cold dark matter. We conclude that models of decaying
dark matter make predictions that are relevant for the interpretation of

coupling regimes (qubit-qubit interaction) as well as for different
temperatures of the reservoir. We find significant disagreements between the
results obtained from the two models even in the weak coupling regime. For
instance, we show that according to the phenomenological model, the isolated
qubit would approach a maximally mixed state more slowly for higher
temperatures (unphysical result), while the microscopic model predicts the
opposite behaviour (correct result).

the discrimination of branches in a quantum evolution, which we dub subchannel

a nearly explosive way from the pixelated graphics to today's near-realistic 3D
environments. The interaction devices traditionally used in videogames have not
evolved with the same intensity, but recent HCI studies have explored
biofeedback interaction - the explicit manipulation of a person's physiological
data as input to a system - as an alternative to them. Traditional biofeedback
prototypes apply 1 sensor to each game mechanic (unimodality).
  In this dissertation, we introduce the combination of 2 physiological sensors
simultaneously per game mechanic (multimodality) and present a First-Person
Shooter game comprised of 8 game mechanics with three interaction flavours (no
biofeedback/vanilla, unimodal and multimodal). An empirical study with 32
regular players was employed to explore and study differences between the three
interaction types and where they can be best employed.
  Players compared the three games in terms of Fun, Ease of Use, Originality,
Playability and Favourite Condition. For the sake of completeness, other
evaluation methods were used as well: IMI Questionnaire, keywords association
and open-ended commentaries. The vanilla version was considered easier to use,
but both biofeedback versions were considered the most fun. Both versions were
praised differently: the unimodal version for its simplicity of use, and the
multimodal for its realism, activation safety of game mechanics and depth added
to the game. Our conclusion is that multimodal biofeedback can have a relevant
impact in terms of added depth, depending on the way it is used inside the
game. On a boundary case, it can be used to increase the feeling of empowerment
on the player when using certain abilities, or to intentionally make in-game
actions more difficult by demanding more physical effort from the player.

validate the abundance determinations for a number of species that were
previously studied in the optical region, and obtain strong upper limits for
beryllium and boron, as well as for neutron-capture elements from zirconium to
platinum, many of which are not accessible from ground-based spectra. The boron
upper limit we obtain for BD+44 493, logeps(B) < -0.70, the first such
measurement for a CEMP star, is the lowest yet found for very and extremely
metal-poor stars. In addition, we obtain even lower upper limits on the
abundances of beryllium, logeps(Be) < -2.3, and lead, logeps(Pb) < -0.23
([Pb/Fe] < +1.90), than those reported by previous analyses in the optical
range. Taken together with the previously measured low abundance of lithium,
the very low upper limits on Be and B suggest that BD+44 493 was formed at a
very early time, and that it could well be a bona-fide second-generation star.

years of the last century in the capture of thermal transversal polarized
neutrons by 113Cd nucleus. In this reaction experimentally was measured a non
zero asymmetry of emitted gamma quanta and the results was interpreted by the
existence of weak non leptonic interaction between nucleons in the compound
nucleus. This first experimental result gave a serious impulse of theoretical
and experimental developments of parity violation question in nuclear
reactions. The weak interaction acts in the background of strong interaction
(with order of magnitude higher) and therefore it is very difficult to observe
and evidence it. One possibility is the evaluation of asymmetry effects induced
by PV phenomena. For neutrons scattering there are a few asymmetry effects
(like polarization of incident neutron beam, spin rotation and emitted neutrons
asymmetry of incident transversal polarized neutrons) explained by the presence
of weak interaction. In natural Lead were observed an unexpected high value of
neutron spin rotation due to the PV phenomena. The natural Lead contains four
isotopes and the main contribution to the PV effects is given by 204Pb. Further
to explain the high value of neutron spin rotation it was supposed the
existence of a new negative P resonance with energy EP = - 16 eV. In this work
were estimated the PV effects in neutrons scattering in order to extract the
weak matrix element and to verify the existence of the new negative resonance
of 204Pb nucleus.

Previous research has shown a variety of different chemical evolutionary stages

rotational transitions of HCO+, H13CO+, HCN, H13CN, HNC, and N2H+. These data
are complemented with near-infrared extinction maps to constrain the column
densities, effective dust temperatures derived from Herschel data, and
NH3-based gas kinetic temperatures. Results: The target cores are located
across the nebula, span visual extinctions between 5 and 67 mag, and effective
dust temperatures (averaged along the lines of sight) between 13 and 19 K. The
extinction-normalized integrated line intensities, a proxy for the abundance in
constant excitation conditions of optically thin lines, vary within an order of
magnitude for a given molecule. The effective dust temperatures and gas kinetic
temperatures are correlated, but the effective dust temperatures are
consistently higher than the gas kinetic temperatures. Combining the molecular
line and temperature data, we find that N2H+ is only detected toward the
coldest and densest cores while other lines show no correlation with these core
properties. Conclusions: Within this large sample, N2H+ is the only species to
exclusively trace the coldest and densest cores, in agreement with chemical
considerations. In contrast, the common high-density tracers HCN and HNC are
present in a majority of cores, demonstrating the utility of these molecules to
characterize cores over a large range of extinctions. The correlation between
the effective dust temperatures and the gas kinetic temperatures suggests that
the former are dominated by dust that is both dense and thermodynamically
coupled to the dense gas traced by NH3. [...]

on weak lensing two- and four-point statistics. These {\it finite support} (FS)
effects are modelled for several estimators, simulation box sizes and source
redshifts, and validated against a new large suite of 500 $N$-body simulations.
The comparison reveals that our theoretical model is accurate to better than 5
per cent for the shear correlation function $\xi_{+}(\theta)$ and its error. We
find that the most important quantities for FS modelling is the ratio between
the measured angle $\theta$ and the angular size of the simulation box at the
source redshift, $\theta_{box}(z_s)$, or the multipole equivalent $\ell /
\ell_{box}(z_s)$. When this ratio reaches 0.1, independently of the source
redshift, the shear correlation function $\xi_+$ is suppressed by 5, 10, 20 and
25 percent for $L_{box}= 1000$, $500$, $250$ and $147\mbox{Mpc}/h$
respectively. When it reaches 0.2, the suppression exceeds 25 percent even for
the largest box. The same effect is observed in $\xi_{-}(\theta)$, but at much
larger angles. This has important consequences for cosmological analyses using
$N$-body simulations to calibrate the impact of non-linear gravitational
clustering or to estimate errors and systematics effects, and should not be
overlooked. We propose simple semi-analytic solutions to correct for these
finite box effects with and without the presence of survey masks, and the
method can be generalized to any weak lensing estimator. This offers a graceful
solution to the important problem of estimating accurate covariance matrices
for weak lensing studies: there is no need to run extra large simulation
volumes, as long as the box effects are corrected.

proton transport is of key importance for the experiment. A novel method of
optics evaluation is proposed which exploits kinematical distributions of
elastically scattered protons observed in the RPs. Theoretical predictions, as
well as Monte Carlo studies, show that the residual uncertainty of this optics
estimation method is smaller than 0.25 percent.

simulate high-dimensional, multimodal probability distributions. In adaptive
MCMC methods, the transition kernel is changed ""on the fly"" in the hope to
speed up convergence. We study interacting tempering, an adaptive MCMC
algorithm based on interacting Markov chains, that can be seen as a simplified
version of the equi-energy sampler. Using a coupling argument, we show that
under easy to verify assumptions on the target distribution (on a finite
space), the interacting tempering process rapidly forgets its starting
distribution. The result applies, among others, to exponential random graph
models, the Ising and Potts models (in mean field or on a bounded degree
graph), as well as (Edwards-Anderson) Ising spin glasses. As a cautionary note,
we also exhibit an example of a target distribution for which the interacting
tempering process rapidly forgets its starting distribution, but takes an
exponential number of steps (in the dimension of the state space) to converge
to its limiting distribution. As a consequence, we argue that convergence
diagnostics that are based on demonstrating that the process has forgotten its
starting distribution might be of limited use for adaptive MCMC algorithms like
interacting tempering.

become a forefront area of research in astronomy. Multiple red giant branches
(RGBs), subgiant branches (SGBs), and even main sequences (MSs) have now been
observed photometrically in many GCs. UV photometry has been crucial in
discovering and analyzing these MPs, but the Johnson U and the Stromgren and
Sloan u filters that have generally been used are relatively inefficient and
very sensitive to reddening and atmospheric extinction. In contrast, the
Washington C filter is much broader and redder than these competing UV filters.
Here we investigate the use of the Washington system to uncover MPs using only
a 1-meter telescope. Our analysis of the well-studied GC NGC 1851 finds that
the C filter is both very efficient and effective at detecting its previously
discovered MPs in the RGB and SGB. Remarkably, we have also detected an
intrinsically broad MS best characterized by two distinct but heavily
overlapping populations that cannot be explained by binaries, field stars, or
photometric errors. The MS distribution is in very good agreement with that
seen on the RGB, with ~30% of the stars belonging to the second population.
There is also evidence for two sequences in the red horizontal branch, but this
appears to be unrelated to the MPs in this cluster. Neither of these latter
phenomena have been observed previously in this cluster. The redder MS stars
are also more centrally concentrated than the blue MS. This is the first time
MPs in a MS have been discovered from the ground, and using only a 1-meter
telescope. The Washington system thus proves to be a very powerful tool for
investigating MPs, and holds particular promise for extragalactic objects where
photons are limited.

($\require{cancel}\cancel{\text{SUSY}}$). In addition to contributions from
sources of $\cancel{\text{SUSY}}$ that are involved in electroweak symmetry
breaking ($\cancel{\text{SUSY}}_\text{EWSB}$ contributions), and which are
manifest from $\langle F^\dagger_H \rangle = \mu \langle \bar H \rangle \neq 0$
and $\langle D \rangle = g \sum_H \langle H^\dagger \otimes_H H \rangle \neq

$\cancel{\text{SUSY}}$ sources that are unrelated to EWSB
($\cancel{\text{SUSY}}_\text{EWS}$ contributions). We point out that recent
literature overlooks pure-$\cancel{\text{SUSY}}_\text{EWSB}$ contributions
($\propto \mu / M$) that can arise at the same order of perturbation theory as
the leading order contribution from $\cancel{\text{SUSY}}_\text{EWS}$.
  We show that there exist realistic radiative seesaw models in which the
leading order contribution to $m_\nu$ is proportional to
$\cancel{\text{SUSY}}_\text{EWS}$. To our knowledge no model with such a
feature exists in the literature. We give a complete description of the
simplest model-topologies and their leading dependence on
$\cancel{\text{SUSY}}$. We show that in one-loop realisations $L L H H$
operators are suppressed by at least $\mu \, m_\text{soft} / M^3$ or
$m_\text{soft}^2 / M^3$. We construct a model example based on a one-loop
type-II seesaw. An interesting aspect of these models lies in the fact that the
scale of soft-$\cancel{\text{SUSY}}$ effects generating the leading order
$m_\nu$ can be quite small without conflicting with lower limits on the mass of
new particles.

BCH introduces characteristic donor levels, causing a strong peak in the DOS

these donor states with two electrons and causing a strong peak in the

vacuum polarisation via a standard dispersion relation from BESII-data on
$e^+e^-\to hadrons$. In the factorisation approximation (FA) the vacuum

significantly enhanced as compared to the FA. A change of the FA-result by a
factor of -2.5, which correspond to a 350%-corrections, results in a reasonable
agreement with the data. This raises the question on the size of
non-factorisable corrections which are colour enhanced but loop-suppressed. In
the parton picture it is found that the corrections are of relative size ~-0.5
when averaged over the open charm-region which is far below -3.5 needed to
explain the observed effect. We present combined fits to the BESII- and the
LHCb-data, testing for effects beyond the Standard Model (SM)-FA. We cannot
find any significant evidence of the parton estimate being too small due to
cancellations between the individual resonances. It seems difficult to
accommodate the LHCb-result in the standard treatment of the SM or QCD
respectively. In the SM the effect can be described in a $q^2$-dependent shift
of the Wilson coefficient combination $C^{eff}_9 + C^{' eff}_9$. We devise
strategies to investigate the microscopic structure in future measurements. We
show that the charm-resonance effects can accommodate the $B \to K^*

  The collective flow increases the energy gain from gluon absorption, however,
decreases the energy loss from gluon radiation, which is $(1 - v_z )$ times as
that in the static medium to the first order of opacity. In the presence of
collective flow, the second order in opacity correction is relatively small

$n$ consumers with combinatorial preferences. It is well known that a
competitive equilibrium is not guaranteed to exist when valuations are not
gross substitutes. Given the widespread use of bundling in real-life markets,
we study its role as a stabilizing and coordinating device by considering the
notion of \emph{competitive bundling equilibrium}: a competitive equilibrium
over the market induced by partitioning the goods for sale into fixed bundles.
Compared to other equilibrium concepts involving bundles, this notion has the
advantage of simulatneous succinctness ($O(m)$ prices) and market clearance.
  Our first set of results concern welfare guarantees. We show that in markets
where consumers care only about the number of goods they receive (known as
multi-unit or homogeneous markets), even in the presence of complementarities,
there always exists a competitive bundling equilibrium that guarantees a
logarithmic fraction of the optimal welfare, and this guarantee is tight. We
also establish non-trivial welfare guarantees for general markets, two-consumer
markets, and markets where the consumer valuations are additive up to a fixed
budget (budget-additive).
  Our second set of results concern revenue guarantees. Motivated by the fact
that the revenue extracted in a standard competitive equilibrium may be zero
(even with simple unit-demand consumers), we show that for natural subclasses
of gross substitutes valuations, there always exists a competitive bundling
equilibrium that extracts a logarithmic fraction of the optimal welfare, and
this guarantee is tight. The notion of competitive bundling equilibrium can
thus be useful even in markets which possess a standard competitive
equilibrium.

exploiting the regularity along the loop dimension, and imposing essential

contribution to the entanglement R\'enyi entropies. However, when close to a
quantum phase transition, its calculation becomes cumbersome. Here we show how
topological phase transitions in 2d systems can be much better assessed by
multipartite entanglement, as measured by the topological geometric
entanglement of blocks. Specifically, we present an efficient tensor network
algorithm based on Projected Entangled Pair States to compute this quantity for
a torus partitioned into cylinders, and then use this method to find sharp
evidence of topological phase transitions in 2d systems with a string-tension
perturbation. When compared to tensor network methods for R\'enyi entropies,
our approach produces almost perfect accuracies close to criticality and, on
top, is orders of magnitude faster. The method can be adapted to deal with any
topological state of the system, including minimally entangled ground states.
It also allows to extract the critical exponent of the correlation length, and
shows that there is no continuous entanglement-loss along renormalization group
flows in topological phases.

is, Alice wants to buy one item from Bob's database, which is composed of a
quantity of valuable messages. QPQ protocol is the communication procedure
ensuring that Alice can get only one item from Bob, and at the same time, Bob
cannot know which one was taken by Alice. Owing to its practicability,
quantum-key-distribution-based QPQ has draw much attention in recent years.
However, the post-processing of the key in such protocols, called oblivious
key, remains far from being satisfactorily known. Especially, the error
correction method for such special key is still missing. Here we focus on the
post-processing of the oblivious key, including both dilution and error
correction. On the one hand, we demonstrate that the previous dilution method,

to illegally obtain much additional information about Bob's database.
Simulations show that by very limited queries Alice can obtain the whole

for the oblivious key, which completes its post-processing and makes such QPQ
more practical.

  6 are insufficient",,,,"stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Numbers and numerical vectors account for a large portion of data. However,
recently the amount of string data generated has increased dramatically.
Consequently, classifying string data is a common problem in many fields. The
most widely used approach to this problem is to convert strings into numerical
vectors using string kernels and subsequently apply a support vector machine
that works in a numerical vector space. However, this non-one-to-one conversion
involves a loss of information and makes it impossible to evaluate, using
probability theory, the generalization error of a learning machine, considering
that the given data to train and test the machine are strings generated
according to probability laws. In this study, we approach this classification
problem by constructing a classifier that works in a set of strings. To
evaluate the generalization error of such a classifier theoretically,
probability theory for strings is required. Therefore, we first extend a limit
theorem on the asymptotic behavior of a consensus sequence of strings, which is
the counterpart of the mean of numerical vectors, as demonstrated in the
probability theory on a metric space of strings developed by one of the authors
and his colleague in a previous study [18]. Using the obtained result, we then
demonstrate that our learning machine classifies strings in an asymptotically
optimal manner. Furthermore, we demonstrate the usefulness of our machine in
practical data analysis by applying it to predicting protein--protein
interactions using amino acid sequences.

hundreds of thousands of commodity servers, making component/ machine failures
the norm rather than exception. A parallel processing job can be delayed
substantially as long as one of its many tasks is being assigned to a failing
machine. To tackle this so-called straggler problem, most parallel processing
frameworks such as MapReduce have adopted various strategies under which the
system may speculatively launch additional copies of the same task if its
progress is abnormally slow or simply because extra idling resource is
available. In this paper, we focus on the design of speculative execution
schemes for a parallel processing cluster under different loading conditions.
For the lightly loaded case, we analyze and propose two optimization-based
schemes, namely, the Smart Cloning Algorithm (SCA) which is based on maximizing
the job utility and the Straggler Detection Algorithm (SDA) which minimizes the
overall resource consumption of a job. We also derive the workload threshold
under which SCA or SDA should be used for speculative execution. Our simulation
results show both SCA and SDA can reduce the job flowtime by nearly 60%
comparing to the speculative execution strategy of Microsoft Mantri. For the
heavily loaded case, we propose the Enhanced Speculative Execution (ESE)
algorithm which is an extension of the Microsoft Mantri scheme. We show that
the ESE algorithm can beat the Mantri baseline scheme by 18% in terms of job
flowtime while consuming the same amount of resource.

Alert Telescope (BAT) almost simultaneously. We analyzed X-ray and UV data for
270 days since the outburst onset taken by repeated MAXI scans and Swift
pointing observations. The obtained X-ray light curve for the inital 90 days is
roughly represented by a fast-rise and exponential-decay profile. However, it
re-brightened on the ~110 days after the onset and finally went down below both
GSC and BAT detec- tion limits on the 240 day. All the X-ray energy spectra are
fitted well with a model consisting of a multi-color-disk blackbody and its
Comptonized hard tail. During the soft-state periods, the inner-disk radius of
the best-fit model were almost constant. If the radius represents the innermost
stable circular orbit of a non-spinning black hole and the soft-to-hard
transitions occur at 1-4% of the Eddington luminosity, the mass of the compact
object is estimated to be > 2.9Mo and the distance to be > 1.70 kpc. The
inner-disk radius became larger in the hard / hard-intermediate state. This
suggests that the accretion disk would be truncated. We detected an excess of
the UV flux over the disk blackbody component extrapolated from the X-ray data,
which can be modelled as reprocessed emission irradiated by the inner disk. We
also found that the UV light curve mostly traced the X-ray curve, but a short
dipping event was observed in both the UV and the X-ray bands with a 3.5-day
X-ray time lag. This can be interpreted as the radial inflow of accreting
matter from the outer UV region to the inner X-ray region.

(e.g.~saturated vapor and liquid) by computer simulation methods is still a
challenging problem due to the difficulty of an atomistic identification of an
interface, and due to interfacial fluctuations on all length scales. The
approach to estimate the interfacial tension from the free energy excess of a
system with interfaces relative to corresponding single-phase systems does not
suffer from the first problem but still suffers from the latter. Considering
$d$-dimensional systems with interfacial area $L^{d-1}$ and linear dimension
$L_z$ in the direction perpendicular to the interface, it is argued that the
interfacial fluctuations cause logarithmic finite-size effects of order $\ln
(L) / L^{d-1}$ and order $\ln (L_z)/L ^{d-1}$, in addition to regular
corrections (with leading order $\text{const}/L^{d-1}$). A phenomenological
theory predicts that the prefactors of the logarithmic terms are universal (but
depend on the applied boundary conditions and the considered statistical
ensemble). The physical origin of these corrections are the translational
entropy of the interface as a whole, ""domain breathing"" (coupling of
interfacial fluctuations to the bulk order parameter fluctuations of the
coexisting domains), and capillary waves. Using a new variant of the ensemble
switch method, interfacial tensions are found from Monte Carlo simulations of
$d=2$ and $d=3$ Ising models and a Lennard Jones fluid. The simulation results
are fully consistent with the theoretical predictions.

and one scalar, are odd under a $Z_2$ symmetry that renders them simultaneously
stable. Thus, both particles contribute to the observed dark matter density.
This model resembles the union of the singlet scalar and the singlet fermionic
models but it contains some new features of its own. We analyze in some detail
its dark matter phenomenology. Regarding the relic density, the main novelty is
the possible annihilation of one dark matter particle into the other, which can
affect the predicted relic density in a significant way. Regarding dark matter
detection, we identify a new contribution that can lead either to an
enhancement or to a suppression of the spin-independent cross section for the
scalar dark matter particle. Finally, we define a set of five benchmarks models
compatible with all present bounds and examine their direct detection prospects
at planned experiments. A generic feature of this model is that both particles
give rise to observable signals in 1-ton direct detection experiments. In fact,
such experiments will be able to probe even a subdominant dark matter component

that a reliable initial fully-parameterized state-space model of the system is
available, the aforementioned paper addresses the challenging problem of
transforming this initial fully-parameterized model into the structured
state-space parameterization satisfied by the system to be identified. Two
solutions to solve such a parameterization problem are more precisely
introduced in the IEEE TAC paper. First, a solution based on a null-space-based
reformulation of a set of equations arising from the aforementioned similarity
transformation problem is considered. Second, an algorithm dedicated to
non-convex optimization is presented in order to transform the initial
fully-parameterized model into the structured state-space parameterization of
the system to be identified. In this technical report, a specific attention is
paid to the gradient computation required by the optimization algorithms used

formulations are indeed necessary to apply the quasi-Newton

the IEEE TAC paper. For the sake of conciseness, we only focus on the smooth

how detailed stellar modeling improves the accuracy and precision on age and
mass of individual stars. We adopt a multifaceted approach where we examine how
the number of observational constraints as well as the uncertainties on
observations and on model input physics impact the age-dating and weighing. We
modelled the exoplanet host-star HD52265, a MS, solar-like oscillator observed
by CoRoT. We considered different sets of observational constraints (HR data,
metallicity, seismic constraints). For each case, we determined the age, mass,
and properties of HD52265 inferred from models, and quantified the impact of
the models inputs. Our seismic analysis provides an age A=2.10-2.54 Gyr, a mass
M=1.14-1.32 Msun, and a radius R=1.30-1.34 Rsun, which corresponds to
uncertainties of 10, 7, and 1.5% respectively. Our seismic study provides
constraints on surface convection, through the mixing-length found to be 12-15%
smaller than the solar one. Because of helium-mass degeneracy, the initial He
abundance is determined modulo the mass. The seismic mass of the exoplanet is
found to be Mp sin i=1.17-1.26 MJup, much more precise than what can be derived
by HR diagram inversion. We demonstrate that asteroseismology allows to improve
the age accuracy compared to other methods. We emphasize that the knowledge of
the mean properties of oscillations -as the large frequency separation- is not
enough for deriving accurate ages. We need precise individual frequencies to
narrow the age scatter due to model uncertainties. This strengthen the case for
precise classical stellar parameters and frequencies as will be obtained by
Gaia and PLATO.

  We give an explicit description of the limit key polynomials (which may be
viewed as a generalization of the Artin--Schreier polynomials). We also give an
upper bound on the order type of the set of key polynomials. Namely, we show
that if $\operatorname{char}\ k_\nu=0$ then the set of key polynomials has

interaction on a lattice. A class of nonlinear Schrodinger models with
arbitrary power nonlinearity is analyzed. We conceive the various regimes of
behavior, depending on the topology of resonance-overlap in phase space,
ranging from a fully developed chaos involving Levy flights to pseudochaotic
dynamics at the onset of delocalization. It is demonstrated that quadratic
nonlinearity plays a dynamically very distinguished role in that it is the only
type of power nonlinearity permitting an abrupt localization-delocalization
transition with unlimited spreading already at the delocalization border. We
describe this localization-delocalization transition as a percolation
transition on a Cayley tree. It is found in vicinity of the criticality that
the spreading of the wave field is subdiffusive in the limit
t\rightarrow+\infty. The second moment grows with time as a powerlaw t^\alpha,
with \alpha = 1/3. Also we find for superquadratic nonlinearity that the analog
pseudochaotic regime at the edge of chaos is self-controlling in that it has
feedback on the topology of the structure on which the transport processes
concentrate. Then the system automatically (without tuning of parameters)
develops its percolation point. We classify this type of behavior in terms of
self-organized criticality dynamics in Hilbert space. For subquadratic
nonlinearities, the behavior is shown to be sensitive to details of definition
of the nonlinear term. A transport model is proposed based on modified
nonlinearity, using the idea of stripes propagating the wave process to large
distances. Theoretical investigations, presented here, are the basis for
consistency analysis of the different localization-delocalization patterns in
systems with many coupled degrees of freedom in association with the asymptotic
properties of the transport.

('white' lies) and antisocial lying (i.e. deception for personal gain), with
the former being considered much less destructive than the latter. We use an
agent-based model to show that antisocial lying causes social networks to
become increasingly fragmented. Antisocial dishonesty thus places strong
constraints on the size and cohesion of social communities, providing a major
hurdle that organisms have to overcome (e.g. by evolving counter-deception
strategies) in order to evolve large, socially cohesive communities. In
contrast, 'white' lies can prove to be beneficial in smoothing the flow of
interactions and facilitating a larger, more integrated network. Our results
demonstrate that these group-level effects can arise as emergent properties of

using HST photometry in both optical and near-infrared filters. The galaxies
contain over 1000 TP-AGB stars (at least 60 per field). We compare the observed
TP-AGB luminosity functions and relative numbers of TP-AGB and RGB stars, to
models generated from different suites of TP-AGB evolutionary tracks after
adopting star formation histories (SFH) derived from the HST deep optical
observations. We test various mass-loss prescriptions that differ in their
treatments of mass-loss before the onset of dust-driven winds (pre-dust). These
comparisons confirm that pre-dust mass-loss is important, since models that
neglect pre-dust mass-loss fail to explain the observed TP-AGB/RGB ratio or the
luminosity functions. In contrast, models with more efficient pre-dust
mass-loss produce results consistent with observations. We find that for
[Fe/H]$\lesssim-0.86$, lower mass TP-AGB stars ($M\lesssim1M_\odot$) must have
lifetimes of $\sim0.5$ Myr and higher masses ($M\lesssim 3M_\odot$) must have
lifetimes $\lesssim 1.2$ Myr. In addition, assuming our best-fitting mass-loss
prescription, we show that the third dredge up has no significant effect on
TP-AGB lifetimes in this mass and metallicity range.

Gauss-Bonnet gravity potentially has superluminal propagation of gravitons due
to its noncanonical kinetic terms. In a theory with superluminal modes, an
analysis of causality based on null curves makes no sense, and thus, we need to
analyze them in a different way. In this paper, using the method of the
characteristics, we analyze the causal structure in Gauss-Bonnet gravity. We
have the result that, on a Killing horizon, gravitons can propagate in the null
direction tangent to the Killing horizon. Therefore, a Killing horizon can be a
causal edge as in the case of general relativity, i.e. a Killing horizon is the
""event horizon"" in the sense of causality. We also analyze causal structures on
nonstationary solutions with $(D-2)$-dimensional maximal symmetry, including
spherically symmetric and flat spaces. If the geometrical null energy
condition, $R_{AB}N^AN^B \ge 0$ for any null vector $N^A$, is satisfied, the
radial velocity of gravitons must be less than or equal to that of light.
However, if the geometrical null energy condition is violated, gravitons can
propagate faster than light. Hence, on an evaporating black hole where the
geometrical null energy condition is expected not to hold, classical gravitons
can escape from the ""black hole"" defined with null curves. That is, the causal
structures become nontrivial. It may be one of the possible solutions for the
information loss paradox of evaporating black holes.

about the identity of the physical processes that energize non-Maxwellian
protons in the solar wind, but a traditional favorite has been the dissipation
of ion cyclotron resonant Alfven waves. This paper presents kinetic models of
how ion cyclotron waves heat protons on their journey from the corona to
interplanetary space. It also derives a wide range of new solutions for the
relevant dispersion relations, marginal stability boundaries, and nonresonant
velocity-space diffusion rates. A phenomenological model containing both
cyclotron damping and turbulent cascade is constructed to explain the
suppression of proton heating at low alpha-proton differential flow speeds.
These effects are implemented in a large-scale model of proton thermal
evolution from the corona to 1 AU. A Monte Carlo ensemble of realistic wind
speeds, densities, magnetic field strengths, and heating rates produces a
filled region of parameter space (in a plane described by the parallel plasma
beta and the proton temperature anisotropy ratio) similar to what is measured.
The high-beta edges of this filled region are governed by plasma instabilities
and strong heating rates. The low-beta edges correspond to weaker proton
heating and a range of relative contributions from cyclotron resonance. On
balance, the models are consistent with other studies that find only a small
fraction of the turbulent power spectrum needs to consist of ion cyclotron
waves.

might be not negligible. This work is devoted to clarify the importance of
accounting the zero-point vibrations when analyzing hydrogen behavior in
silicon and its effect on silicon electronic properties. For this, we estimate
the ZPE for different locations and charge states of H in Si. We show that the
main contribution to the ZPE is coming from vibrations along the Si-H bonds
whereas contributions from other Si atoms apart from the direct Si-H bonds play
no role. It is demonstrated that accounting the ZPE reduces the hydrogen
formation energy by ~0.17 eV meaning that neglecting ZPE at low temperatures
one can underestimate hydrogen solubility by few orders of magnitude. In
contrast, the effect of the ZPE on the ionization energy of H in Si is
negligible. The results can have important implications for characterization of
vibrational properties of Si by inelastic neutron scattering, as well as for
theoretical estimations of H concentration in Si.

critical current. With high trapped fields, however, bulk samples are subject
to a relatively large Lorentz force, and their performance is limited primarily
by their tensile strength. Consequently, sample reinforcement is the key to
performance improvement in these technologically important materials. In this
work, we report a trapped field of 17.6 T, the largest reported to date, in a
stack of two, silver-doped GdBCO superconducting bulk samples, each of diameter
25 mm, fabricated by top-seeded melt growth (TSMG) and reinforced with

of being relatively straightforward and inexpensive to implement and offers the
prospect of easy access to portable, high magnetic fields without any

To appear in Physical Review D",,"10.1103/PhysRevD.90.035009",,"hep-ph astro-ph.HE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  An emission line with energy of $E\sim 3.5$ keV has been observed in galaxy
clusters by two experiments. The emission line is consistent with the decay of
a dark matter particle with a mass of $\sim 7$ keV. In this work we discuss the
possibility that the dark particle responsible for the emission is a real
scalar ($\rho$) which arises naturally in a $U(1)_X$ Stueckelberg of MSSM. In
the MSSM Stueckelberg extension $\rho$ couples only to other scalars carrying a
$U(1)_X$ quantum number. Under the assumption that there exists a vectorlike
leptonic generation carrying both $SU(2)_L\times U(1)_Y$ and $U(1)_X$ quantum
numbers, we compute the decay of the $\rho$ into two photons via a triangle
loop involving scalars. The relic density of the $\rho$ arises via the decay
$H^0\to h^0+ \rho$ at the loop level involving scalars, and via the
annihilation processes of the vectorlike scalars into $\rho + h^0$. It is shown
that the galactic data can be explained within a multicomponent dark matter
model where the 7 keV dark matter is a subdominant component constituting only
$(1-10)$\% of the matter relic density with the rest being supersymmetric dark
matter such as the neutralino. Thus the direct detection experiments remain
viable searches for WIMPs. The fact that the dark scalar $\rho$ with no
interactions with the standard model particles arises from a Stueckelberg
extension of a hidden $U(1)_X$ implies that the 3.5 KeV galactic line emission
is a signal from the hidden sector.

conditions in the pre-solar nebula, including the attainable chemical
complexity, important for prebiotic chemistry. The formation and distribution
of complex organic molecules (COMs) in a disk around a T Tauri star is
investigated for two scenarios: (i) an isolated disk, and (ii) a disk
irradiated externally by a nearby massive star. The chemistry is calculated
along the accretion flow from the outer disk inwards using a comprehensive
network. Two simulations are performed, one beginning with complex ices and one
with simple ices only. For the isolated disk, COMs are transported without
major alteration into the inner disk where they thermally desorb into the gas
reaching an abundance representative of the initial assumed ice abundance. For
simple ices, COMs efficiently form on grain surfaces under the conditions in
the outer disk. Gas-phase COMs are released into the molecular layer via
photodesorption. For the irradiated disk, complex ices are also transported
inwards; however, they undergo thermal processing caused by the warmer
conditions in the irradiated disk which tends to reduce their abundance along
the accretion flow. For simple ices, grain-surface chemistry cannot synthesise
COMs in the outer disk because the necessary grain-surface radicals, which tend
to be particularly volatile, are not sufficiently abundant on the grain
surfaces. Gas-phase COMs are formed in the inner region of the irradiated disk
via gas-phase chemistry induced by the desorption of strongly bound molecules
such as methanol; hence, the abundances are not representative of the initial
molecular abundances injected into the outer disk. These results suggest that
the composition of comets formed in isolated disks may differ from those formed
in externally irradiated disks with the latter composed of more simple ices.

HD200466, a system made of two almost identical solar-type stars with an
apparent separation of 4.6 arcsec at a distance of 44+/-2 pc. High precision RV
over more than a decade, adaptive optics (AO) images, and abundances have been
obtained for both components. A linear trend in the RV is found for the
secondary. We assumed that it is due to the binary orbit and once coupled with
the astrometric data, it strongly constrains the orbital solution of the binary
at high eccentricities (e~0.85) and quite small periastron of ~21 AU. If this
orbital motion is subtracted from the primary radial velocity curve, a highly
significant (false alarm probability <0.1%) period of about 1300 d is obtained,
suggesting in a first analysis the presence of a giant planet, but it turned
out to be due to the stellar activity cycle. Since our spectra do not include
the Ca~II resonance lines, we measured a chromospheric activity indicator based
on the Halpha line to study the correlation between activity cycles and
long-term activity variations. While the bisector analysis of the line profile
does not show a clear indication of activity, the correlation between the
Halpha line indicator and the RV measurements identify the presence of a strong
activity cycle.

like to use this transition domain for shock wave induced ultrafast ignition of

and the main advantages of this scheme are described. If this scheme is
successful a new source of energy in large quantities may become feasible.

complemented them with literature and archival data. We used this material to
derive the photometric, spectroscopic and kinematic properties of the brightest
(V < 16) stars in the region. The VI deep photometry on the other end, helped
us to unravel the lower main sequence of a few, possibly physical, star groups
in the area.
  Our analysis confirmed previous suggestions that the extinction toward this
line of sight follows the normal law (Rv = 3.1). We could recognize B-type
stars spread in distance from a few hundred pc to at least 2 kpc. We found two
young groups (age ~ 3 Myr) located respectively at about 2.3 and 3.2 kpc from
the Sun. They are characterized by a significant variable extinction (E(B-V)
ranging from 0.28 to 0.45 mag), and host a significant pre-main sequence
population. We computed the initial mass functions for these groups and
obtained slopes Gamma from -0.94 to -1.02 (e_Gamma = 0.3), in a scale where the
classical Salpeter law is -1.35. We estimated the total mass of both main
stellar groups in ~ 1100$ and ~ 500$ Mo, respectively. Our kinematic analysis
indicated that both groups of stars deviate from the standard rotation curve of
the Milky Way, in line with literature results for this specific Galactic
direction.
  Finally, along the same line of sight we identified a third group of
early-type stars located at ~ 8 kpc from the Sun. This group might be located
in the far side of the Sagittarius-Carina spiral arm.

Keplerian rotation around a single point mass but rather needs to take into
account the enclosed envelope mass at the radii where the observed lines are
excited. We suggest that IRAS 16293-2422 could be among the best candidates to

perihelion of any known minor planet and the value of its argument of

members of a hidden or hard-to-reach population such as sex workers, homeless
people, or drug users via their social network. Most methodological work on RDS
has focused on inference of population means under the assumption that
subjects' network degree determines their probability of being sampled.
Criticism of existing estimators is usually focused on missing data: the
underlying network is only partially observed, so it is difficult to determine
correct sampling probabilities. In this paper, we show that data collected in
ordinary RDS studies contain information about the structure of the
respondents' social network. We construct a continuous-time model of RDS
recruitment that incorporates the time series of recruitment events, the
pattern of coupon use, and the network degrees of sampled subjects. Together,
the observed data and the recruitment model place a well-defined probability
distribution on the recruitment-induced subgraph of respondents. We show that
this distribution can be interpreted as an exponential random graph model and
develop a computationally efficient method for estimating the hidden graph. We
validate the method using simulated data and apply the technique to an RDS
study of injection drug users in St. Petersburg, Russia.

selected from the ~3 Myr sigma Ori, 4-6 Myr Orion OB1b and 7-10 Myr Orion OB1a
star forming associations. We use high resolution spectra from the Magellan

calculate extinction for our T Tauri sample. We also use observations, obtained
with the Magellan Echellette and in a few cases the SWIFT Ultraviolet and

We find that even objects as old as 10 Myr may have high accretion rates, up to
~10^-8 msun/ yr. These objects cannot be explained by viscous evolution models,
which would deplete the disk in shorter timescales, unless the initial disk
mass is very high, a situation which is unstable. We show that the infrared

$T_\mathrm{h} \lesssim 10^9$ K in the heater) the thermal surface emission of
the star depends on the heater's power and neutrino emission in the stellar
core. In the second, neutrino outflow regime ($H_0 \gtrsim 10^{20}$ erg
cm$^{-3}$ s$^{-1}$ or $T_\mathrm{h} \gtrsim 10^9$ K) the surface thermal
emission becomes independent of heater's power and the physics of the core. The
largest (a few per cent) fraction of heat power is carried to the surface if
the heater is in the outer crust and the heat regime is intermediate. The
results can be used for modeling young cooling neutron stars (prior to the end
of internal thermal relaxation), neutron stars in X-ray transients, magnetars
and high-$B$ pulsars, as well as merging neutron stars.

which an auction mechanism is used to select the ads shown to users and

of work in the literature that investigate how to design an auction mechanism

unrealistic assumptions used, the practical values of these studies are not
very clear. In this paper, we propose a novel \emph{game-theoretic machine

and learns the auction mechanism using a bilevel optimization framework. In
particular, we first learn a Markov model from historical data to describe how
advertisers change their bids in response to an auction mechanism, and then for
any given auction mechanism, we use the learnt model to predict its
corresponding future bid sequences. Next we learn the auction mechanism through
empirical revenue maximization on the predicted bid sequences. We show that the
empirical revenue will converge when the prediction period approaches infinity,
and a Genetic Programming algorithm can effectively optimize this empirical
revenue. Our experiments indicate that the proposed approach is able to produce
a much more effective auction mechanism than several baselines.

S\'anchez-Guill\'en and Wereszczy\'nski, the following variant of the harmonic
map problem is introduced: a map $\phi:(M,g)\rightarrow (N,h)$ between
Riemannian manifolds is restricted harmonic (RH) if it locally extremizes $E_2$
on its $SDiff(M)$ orbit, where $SDiff(M)$ denotes the group of volume
preserving diffeomorphisms of $(M,g)$, and $E_2$ denotes the Dirichlet energy.
It is conjectured that near BPS skyrmions tend to RH maps in the BPS limit. It
is shown that $\phi$ is RH if and only if $\phi^*h$ has exact divergence, and a
linear stability theory of RH maps is developed, whence it follows that all
weakly conformal maps, for example, are stable RH. Examples of RH maps in every
degree class $R^3\to SU(2)$ and $R^2\to S^2$ are constructed. It is shown that
the axially symmetric BPS skyrmions on which all previous analytic studies of
near BPS Skyrme models have been based, are not RH, so each such field can be
deformed along $SDiff(R^3)$ to yield BPS skyrmions with lower $E_2$, casting
doubt on the predictions of such studies. The problem of minimizing $E_2$ for
$\phi:R^k\to N$ over all linear volume preserving diffeomorphisms is solved
explicitly, and a deformed axially symmetric family of Skyrme fields
constructed which are candidates for approximate near BPS skyrmions at low
baryon number. The notion of restricted harmonicity is generalized to
restricted $F$-criticality where $F$ is any functional on maps $(M,g)\to (N,h)$
which is, in a precise sense, geometrically natural. The case where $F$ is a
linear combination of $E_2$ and $E_4$, the usual Skyrme term, is studied in
detail, and it is shown that inverse stereographic projection $R^3\to S^3\equiv
SU(2)$ is stable restricted $F$-critical for every such $F$.

short acquisition intervals with a mobile detector-spectrometer. Detecting
sources from measured data is difficult because of low signal to noise ratio
(S/N) of spectra, large and highly varying background due to naturally
occurring radioactive material (NORM), and line broadening due to limited
spectral resolution of nuclear detector. We have invented a method for
detection of sources using clustering of spectral data. Our method takes
advantage of the physical fact that a source not only produces counts in the
region of its spectral emission, but also has the effect on the entire detector
spectrum via Compton continuum. This allows characterizing the low S/N spectrum
without distinct isotopic lines using multiple data features. We have shown
that noisy spectra with low S/N can be grouped by overall spectral shape
similarity using a data clustering technique called Dynamic Quantum Clustering
(DQC). The spectra in the same cluster can then be averaged to enhance S/N of
the isotopic spectral line. This would allow for increased accuracy of isotopic
identification and lower false alarm rate. Our method was validated in a
proof-of principle study using a data set of spectra measured in one-second
intervals with Sodium Iodide detector. The data set consisted of over 7000
spectra obtained in urban background measurements, and approximately 70
measurements of Cs-137 and Co-60 sources. Using DQC analysis, we have observed
that all spectra containing Cs-137 and Co-60 signal cluster away from the
background.

  Riemannian manifolds","39 pages",,,,"math.DG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We introduce the concept of Calder\'on-Zygmund inequalities on Riemannian
manifolds. For $1<p<\infty$, these are inequalities of the form $$ \left\Vert
\mathrm{Hess}\left( u\right) \right\Vert _{L^p}\leq C_{1}\left\Vert
u\right\Vert _{L^p}+C_{2}\left\Vert \Delta u\right\Vert _{L^p}, $$ valid a
priori for all smooth functions $u$ with compact support, and constants
$C_1\geq 0$, $C_2>0$. Such an inequality can hold or fail, depending on the
underlying Riemannian geometry. After establishing some generally valid facts
and consequences of the Calder\'on-Zygmund inequality (like new denseness
results for second order $\mathsf{L}^p$-Sobolev spaces and gradient estimates),
we establish sufficient geometric criteria for the validity of these
inequalities on possibly noncompact Riemannian manifolds. These results in
particular apply to many noncompact hypersurfaces of constant mean curvature.

from scattering data for static field configurations whose interactions with
the fluctuating field are frequency independent. In effective theories,
however,such interactions are typically frequency dependent. As a consequence,
the relationship between scattering data and the Green's function is modified,
which may or may not induce additional contributions to the vacuum polarization
energy. We discuss several examples that naturally include frequency dependent
interactions: (i) scalar electrodynamics with a static background potential,
(ii) an effective theory that emerges from integrating out a heavy degree of
freedom, and (iii) quantum electrodynamics coupled to a frequency dependent
dielectric material. In the latter case, we argue that introducing dissipation
as required by the Kramers-Kronig relations requires the consideration of the
Casimir energy within a statistical mechanics formalism, while in the absence
of dissipation we can work entirely within field theory, using an alternative
formulation of the energy density.

rests on the screening of the ion charge by electrons. However, in a CeC system
with a bunched electron beam, inevitably, a long-range longitudinal space
charge force is introduced. For a relatively dense electron beam, its force can
be comparable to, or even greater than the attractive force from the ions.
Hence, the influence of the space charge field on the modulation process could
be important. If the 3-D Debye lengths are much smaller than the extension of
the electron bunch, the modulation induced by the ion happens locally. Then, in
that case, we can approximate the long-range longitudinal space charge field as
a uniform electric field across the region. As detailed in this paper, we
developed an analytical model to study the dynamics of ion shielding in the
presence of a uniform electric field. We solved the coupled Vlasov-Poisson
equation system for an infinite anisotropic electron plasma, and estimated the
influences of the longitudinal space charge field to the modulation process for
the experimental proof of the CeC principle at RHIC.

indirect exchange coupling between magnetic impurities embedded in metallic

referred to as the Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY) interaction. Recent

consequences for the spintronic application of magnetically-doped and we

on their observed non-thermal synchrotron emission. The correct form of this
method takes into account both the internal energy in the jet and the ion
rest-mass energy associated with the bulk motion. The latter was neglected in a
number of papers, which instead adopted the well-known energy-content
minimization method. That method was developed for static sources, for which
there is no bulk-motion component of the energy. In the case of electron
power-law spectra with index >2 in ion-electron jets, the rest-mass component
dominates. The minimization method for the jet power taking it into account was
considered in some other work, but only based on either an assumption of a
constant total synchrotron flux or a fixed range of the Lorentz factors.
Instead, we base our method on an observed optically-thin synchrotron spectrum.
We find the minimum jet power is independent of its radius when the ion
rest-mass power dominates, which becomes the case below certain critical
radius. This allows for robust minimum power estimates. We also present results
for the case with observed turnover frequency, at which the source becomes
optically thick. This method allows a determination of the source size, in
addition to the power and the magnetic field. We also point out that when the
ion rest-mass power dominates, the estimates of the minimum power lead to very
different equipartition parameters than those based on minimization of the
energy content. The former and latter lead to approximate equipartition between
the internal energy in magnetic field and in particles including and excluding,
respectively, their rest mass energy.

obtained with the Large Binocular Telescope (LBT) LUCI instrument, which covers
the HH34 jet and counterjet. A Point Spread Function (PSF) deconvolution
algorithm was applied to enhance spatial resolution and make the IR image
directly comparable to a [SII] HST image of the same source. The [FeII]
emission is detected from both the jet, the (weak) counter-jet, and from the
HH34-S and HH34-N bow shocks. The deconvolved image allows us to resolve jet
knots close to about 1\arcsec from the central source. The morphology of the
[FeII] emission is remarkably similar to that of the [SII] emission, and the
relative positions of [FeII] and [SII] peaks are shifted according to proper
motion measurements, which were previously derived from HST images. An analysis
of the [FeII]/[SII] emission ratio shows that Fe gas abundance is much lower
than the solar value with up to 90% of Fe depletion in the inner jet knots.
This confirms previous findings on dusty jets, where shocks are not efficient
enough to remove refractory species from grains.

essentially self-contained proofs of some classical, as well as more recent,
results about random walks on groups. For instance, we shall see that the drift
characterization of Liouville groups, due to Kaimanovich-Vershik and
Karlsson-Ledrappier (and to Varopoulos in some important special cases) admits
a very short and quite elementary proof. Furthermore, we give a new, and rather
short proof of (a weak version of) an observation of Kaimanovich (as well as a
small strengthening thereof) that the Poisson boundary of any symmetric
measured group $(G,\mu)$, is doubly ergodic, and the diagonal $G$-action on its
product is ergodic with unitary coefficients. We also offer a characterization
of weak mixing for ergodic $(G,\mu)$-spaces parallel to the measure-preserving
case.
  We shed some new light on Nagaev's classical technique to prove central limit
theorems for random walks on groups. In the interesting special case when the
measured group admits a product current, we define a Besov space structure on
the space of bounded harmonic functions with respect to which the the
associated convolution operator is quasicompact without any assumptions on
finite exponential moments. For Gromov hyperbolic measured groups, this gives
an alternative proof of the fact that every H\""older continuous function with
zero integral with respect to the unique stationary probability measure on the
Gromov boundary is a co-boundary.
  Finally, we give a new and almost self-contained proof of a special case of a
recent combinatorial result about piecewise syndeticity of product sets in
groups by the author and A. Fish.

after every 5 time steps, a group of 3 agents become disconnected at either end

are fewer than 6 agents left in the middle, and these finally collapse to a

show how changes in embodiment and in the environment change the resulting

we introduce an approximation of the established empowerment formalism based on
sparse sampling, which is simpler and significantly faster to compute for
deterministic dynamics. Sparse sampling also introduces a degree of randomness
into the decision making process, which turns out to beneficial for some cases.
We then utilize the measure to generate agent behaviour for different agent
embodiments in a Minecraft-inspired three dimensional block world. The
paradigmatic results demonstrate that empowerment can be used as a suitable
generic intrinsic motivation to not only generate actions in given static
environments, as shown in the past, but also to modify existing environmental
conditions. In doing so, the emerging strategies to modify an agent's

$$S_n=n+\frac{1}{2}\left\lfloor\frac{\sqrt{8n+1}-1}{2}\right\rfloor^2-\frac{1}{2}\left\lfloor\frac{\sqrt{8n+1}-1}{2}\right\rfloor+1\text{.}$$
We use this last result in order to create plots of
$h(n)=\pi[S_n,S_n+\lfloor\sqrt{S_n}\rfloor-1]$ for many values of $n$.

$O(q^{\frac{N-1}{2}}\log^{300} q)$ are obtained by probabilistic methods. This
gives an upper bound asymptotically very close to the trivial lower bound
$\sqrt{2}q^{\frac{N-1}{2}}$ and it improves the best known bound in the
literature for small complete caps in projective spaces of any dimension. The
result obtained in the paper also gives a new upper bound for $l(m,2,q)_4$,
that is the minimal length $n$ for which there exists an $[n,n-m, 4]_q2$
covering code with given $m$ and $q$.

Minkowski geometry. This geometry conflict the intuition from the Euclid
geometry. In this work an Euclid space-time diagram is proposed to describe
relativistic world lines with an exact Euclid geometry. The relativistic
effects such as the dilation of moving clocks, the contraction of moving
length, and the twin paradox can be geometrically expressed in the Euclid
space-time diagram. It is applied to the case of a satellite clock to correct
the gravitational effect. It is found that this Euclid space-time diagram is
much more intuitive than the conventional space-time diagram.

interactions between coherent matter, i.e. matter described by a macroscopic
wave function or a classical field, and a certain class of vacuum fluctuations,
called ""zero-modes of the Einstein action"". These are little-known virtual
masses present in the vacuum state of quantum gravity. A couple of equal masses
of this kind can be excited by an oscillating coherent source with frequency f
and decays to its ground state emitting a virtual graviton, which can propagate
and transfer momentum p to ordinary matter. The virtual masses recoil in the
emission, and this amounts to a transfer of momentum -p to the vacuum; this
momentum can be passed in turn to some matter, or not. The energy hf for the
process does not come from the vacuum, but from the coherent source. The ratio
hf/p is of the order of 1 m/s. This model was developed to explain experimental
results showing the emission of anomalous high-momentum radiation from certain
superconductors, sometimes with a strong recoil of the emitters. The recoil is
energetically quite efficient, at least at small power, and could be exploited
for propulsion. It has not been tested in space, however, and our model cannot
yet predict if the recoil is affected by the presence of near matter. (Another
model predicts that it is not.) We also briefly mention a possible application
of the anomalous radiation itself and we evaluate the (large) electric and
magnetic field strength needed to produce an effect equivalent to that of a
superconducting emitter.
