and functions from point cloud data arising from an unknown distribution
supported on those sets. When the size of the sample is large, direct
computation of the persistent homology is prohibitive due to the combinatorial
nature of the existing algorithms. We propose to compute the persistent

Earth crust (Earth-skimming {\nu}), producing air showers that can be observed
with arrays of detectors at the ground. The surface detector array of the
Pierre Auger Observatory can detect these types of cascades. The distinguishing
signature for neutrino events is the presence of very inclined showers produced
close to the ground (i.e., after having traversed a large amount of
atmosphere). Up to now, the Pierre Auger Observatory did not find any candidate
for a neutrino event.
  A very low rate of events potentially generated by neutrinos is a significant
challenge for a detection technique and requires both sophisticated algorithms
and high-resolution hardware. We present a trigger based on a pipeline
artificial neural network (ANN) implemented in a large FPGA which after
learning can recognize traces corresponding to special types of events.
  The structure of an ANN algorithm being developed on the MATLAB platform has
been implemented into the fast logic of the biggest Cyclone V E FPGA used for
the prototype of the Front-End Board for the Auger-Beyond-2015 effort. Several
algorithms were tested, however, the Levenberg-Marquardt one seems to be the
most efficient.
  The network was taught: a) to recognize ""old"" showers (learning on a basis of
real very inclined Auger showers (positive markers) and real standard showers
especially triggered by Time over Threshold (negative marker), b) to recognize
""young"" showers (on the basis of simulated ""young"" events (positive markers)

network being taught by real very inclined Auger showers shows a good

still needs additional user support. However, this additional user support
should be intuitive and rapid integrated into the segmentation process, without
breaking the interactive real-time segmentation feedback. I propose a solution
where the user can support the algorithm by an easy and fast placement of one

also in difficult cases. These additional seed(s) restrict(s) the calculation

curves in their thermodynamic phase diagrams, so-called isomorphs, along which
structure and dynamics in reduced units are invariant to a good approximation.
The crystals are studied in a classical-mechanical framework, which is
generally a good description except significantly below melting. The existence
of isomorphs for crystals is validated by simulations of particles interacting
via the Lennard-Jones pair potential arranged into a face-centered cubic (FCC)
crystalline structure; the slow vacancy-jump dynamics of a defective FCC
crystal is also shown to be isomorph invariant. In contrast, a NaCl crystal
model does not exhibit isomorph invariances. Other systems simulated, though in
less detail, are the Wahnstrom binary Lennard-Jones crystal with the ${\rm
MgZn_2}$ Laves crystal structure, monatomic FCC crystals of particles
interacting via the Buckingham pair potential and via a novel purely repulsive
pair potential diverging at a finite separation, an ortho-terphenyl molecular
model, and SPC/E hexagonal ice. Except for NaCl and ice, the crystals simulated
all have isomorphs. Based on these findings and previous simulations of liquid
models, we conjecture that crystalline solids with isomorphs include most or
all formed by atoms or molecules interacting via metallic or van der Waals
forces, whereas covalently- or hydrogen-bonded crystals are not expected to
have isomorphs. Crystals of ions or dipolar molecules constitute a limiting
case for which isomorphs are only expected when the Coulomb interactions are
relatively weak. We briefly discuss the consequences of the findings for
theories of melting and crystallization.

resolved fluctuation energy. This function is found as a minimizer of a cost
functional measuring the difference between the target data coming from a
resolved direct or large-eddy simulation of the flow and its reconstruction
based on the POD model. The optimization is performed with a data-assimilation
approach generalizing the 4D-VAR method. POD models with optimal eddy

(based on the initial vorticity thickness and the velocity of the high-speed
stream) and a 3D Ahmed body wake at $Re=300,000$ (based on the body height and
the free-stream velocity). The variational optimization formulation elucidates
a number of interesting physical insights concerning the eddy-viscosity ansatz
used. The 20-dimensional model of the mixing-layer reveals a negative
eddy-viscosity regime at low fluctuation levels which improves the transient
times towards the attractor. The 100-dimensional wake model yields more

especially above the critical temperature. Using different Skyrme energy
functionals, it is found that the correlation between the effective mass in
symmetric nuclear matter and the critical temperature depends on the pairing
prescription. The temperature dependence of the nucleon effective mass is also
investigated, showing that proton and neutron effective masses display
different behavior below and above the critical temperature, due to the small
temperature dependence of the density.

hybrid systems, i.e., the probability that the system reaches an unsafe region
within a finite number of discrete transitions. In particular, we focus on
hybrid systems with continuous dynamics given by solutions of nonlinear
ordinary differential equations (with possibly nondeterministic initial
conditions and parameters), and probabilistic behaviour given by initial
parameters distributed as continuous (with possibly infinite support) and
discrete random variables. Our approach is to define an appropriate relaxation
of the (undecidable) reachability problem, so that it can be solved by
$\delta$-complete decision procedures. In particular, for systems with
continuous random parameters only, we develop a validated integration procedure
which computes an arbitrarily small interval that is guaranteed to contain the
reachability probability. In the more general case of systems with both
nondeterministic and probabilistic parameters, our procedure computes a
guaranteed enclosure for the range of reachability probabilities. We have
applied our approach to a number of nonlinear hybrid models and validated the
results by comparison with Monte Carlo simulation.

fundamental decision-theoretic problem that asks if two arbitrary (possibly
multivariate) random variables $X,Y$ are independent or not, a question that
comes up in many fields like causality and neuroscience. While quantities like
correlation of $X,Y$ only test for (univariate) linear independence, natural
alternatives like mutual information of $X,Y$ are hard to estimate due to a
serious curse of dimensionality. A recent approach, avoiding both issues,
estimates norms of an \textit{operator} in Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces
(RKHSs). Our main contribution is strong empirical evidence that by employing
\textit{shrunk} operators when the sample size is small, one can attain an
improvement in power at low false positive rates. We analyze the effects of
Stein shrinkage on a popular test statistic called HSIC (Hilbert-Schmidt
Independence Criterion). Our observations provide insights into two recently
proposed shrinkage estimators, SCOSE and FCOSE - we prove that SCOSE is
(essentially) the optimal linear shrinkage method for \textit{estimating} the
true operator; however, the non-linearly shrunk FCOSE usually achieves greater
improvements in \textit{test power}. This work is important for more powerful
nonparametric detection of subtle nonlinear dependencies for small samples.

combinations. For this, pairwise synergies based on saving values as well as
the capacitated p-median problem are used. The bidding strategies are evaluated
by a computational study that simulates an auction. It is based on 174
benchmark instances and therefore easily extendable by other researchers. On
average, the two heuristic strategies achieve 91 percent and 81 percent of the

Lorentzian spacetime, which admits a nonvanishing parallel spinor field; here
the connection is assumed to be Levi-Civita. This definition was generalised in
our previous work to metric compatible spacetimes with torsion and used to
construct new explicit vacuum solutions of quadratic metric-affine gravity,
namely generalised pp-waves of parallel Ricci curvature. The physical
interpretation of these solutions we propose in this article is that they
represent a conformally invariant metric-affine model for a massless elementary
particle. We give a comparison with the classical model describing the
interaction of gravitational and massless neutrino fields, namely Einstein-Weyl
theory and construct pp-wave type solutions of this theory. We point out that
generalised pp-waves of parallel Ricci curvature are very similar to pp-wave
type solutions of the Einstein-Weyl model and therefore propose that our

advection equation in the case where high precision is desired. The numerical
methods considered are based on the fast Fourier transform, polynomial
interpolation (semi-Lagrangian methods using a Lagrange or spline
interpolation), and a discontinuous Galerkin semi-Lagrangian approach (which is
conservative and has to store more than a single value per cell).
  We demonstrate, by carrying out numerical experiments, that the worst case
error estimates given in the literature provide a good explanation for the
error propagation of the interpolation-based semi-Lagrangian methods. For the
discontinuous Galerkin semi-Lagrangian method, however, we find that the
characteristic property of semi-Lagrangian error estimates (namely the fact
that the error increases proportionally to the number of time steps) is not
observed. We provide an explanation for this behavior and conduct numerical
simulations that corroborate the different qualitative features of the error in
the two respective types of semi-Lagrangian methods.
  The method based on the fast Fourier transform is exact but, due to round-off
errors, susceptible to a linear increase of the error in the number of time
steps. We show how to modify the Cooley--Tukey algorithm in order to obtain an
error growth that is proportional to the square root of the number of time
steps.
  Finally, we show, for a simple model, that our conclusions hold true if the
advection solver is used as part of a splitting scheme.

number of past selections ($p(w)\sim w^{\alpha}, \ \alpha<1$), agents develop a
uniform preference for all other agents. At $\alpha=1$, this state looses
stability and more complex structures form. For a superlinear increase
($\alpha>1$), strong heterogeneities emerge and agents make selections mainly
within small and sometimes asymmetric clusters. Even in a few-agent case,
formation of such clusters resembles phase transitions with spontaneous
symmetry breaking.

fit continuous bounded data. These models present some characteristics in
common and to select one of them in a practical situation can be of great
interest. With this in mind, in this paper we propose a method of selection
between the beta and Kumaraswamy distributions. We use the logarithm of the
likelihood ratio statistic (denoted by $T_n$, where $n$ is the sample size) and
obtain its asymptotic distribution under the hypotheses $H_{\mathcal B}$ and
$H_{\mathcal K}$, where $H_{\mathcal B}$ ($H_{\mathcal K}$) denotes that the
data come from the beta (Kumaraswamy) distribution. Since both models has the
same number of parameters, based on the Akaike criterion, we choose the model
that has the greater log-likelihood value. We here propose to use the
probability of correct selection (given by $P(T_n>0)$ or $P(T_n<0)$ depending
on the null hypothesis) instead of only to observe the maximized log-likelihood
values. We obtain an approximation for the probability of correct selection
under the hypotheses $H_{\mathcal B}$ and $H_{\mathcal K}$ and select the model
that maximizes it. A simulation study is presented in order to evaluate the
accuracy of the approximated probabilities of correct selection. We illustrate
our method of selection in two applications to real data sets involving
proportions.

last decade. At its core, the assumption is that the signal of interest is
sparse with respect to either a fixed transformation or a signal dependent
dictionary. To better capture the data characteristics, various dictionary
learning methods have been proposed for both reconstruction and classification
tasks. For classification particularly, most approaches proposed so far have
focused on designing explicit constraints on the sparse code to improve
classification accuracy while simply adopting $l_0$-norm or $l_1$-norm for
sparsity regularization. Motivated by the success of structured sparsity in the
area of Compressed Sensing, we propose a structured dictionary learning
framework (StructDL) that incorporates the structure information on both group
and task levels in the learning process. Its benefits are two-fold: (i) the
label consistency between dictionary atoms and training data are implicitly
enforced; and (ii) the classification performance is more robust in the cases
of a small dictionary size or limited training data than other techniques.
Using the subspace model, we derive the conditions for StructDL to guarantee
the performance and show theoretically that StructDL is superior to $l_0$-norm
or $l_1$-norm regularized dictionary learning for classification. Extensive
experiments have been performed on both synthetic simulations and real world
applications, such as face recognition and object classification, to
demonstrate the validity of the proposed DL framework.

the stability of the nematic phase, but also determines the slope of the

obtained. The solution meets a devised non-linear finite dimension Hamiltonian
dynamic system for the coordinates and the Lamb impulses of N point vortex
dipoles (PVD), i.e. extremely small solid spherical particles, moving with
respect to the fluid. For N=2 the necessary condition for the collapse (or the
converging in one point during the finite time) of two PVD is stated. On the
base of the proposed theory, the new hydrodynamic mechanism of converging for
two small spherical particles (of the same radius) is introduced and used for
interpreting the observed paradoxical effects of attraction for micro particles
with the same sign of electrical charge in the colloid and dusty plasma
systems. The correspondence of the condition for collapse of two PVD with the
experimentally observed data where convergence of two like-charged
micro-spheres moving in the fluid layer is observed only when definite
necessary restrictions on the fluid layer depth are imposed from above and
below (J. C. Crocker, D. G. Grier, 1996) is stated. We also state the
possibility of correspondence between the obtained condition of collapse for
two PVD in the limit of unbounded fluid and known numerical results on the
threshold of the impact parameter for the realization of resonance bond state
(and corresponding stochastic dynamic regime) for two finite size vortex
dipoles during their scattering in unbounded fluid (S. V. Manakov, L. N.

Cu foils and large-area dielectric ~1 nm thick amino-terminated carbon
nanomembranes (NH2-CNMs) generated by electron-beam-induced crosslinking of
aromatic self-assembled monolayers. We encapsulate SLG sheets on oxidized

by Raman spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy as well as by
electric and electromagnetic transport measurements. We show that functional
amino groups are brought in close vicinity of the SLG sheets and that their
transport characteristics are not impaired by this functionalization; moreover,
we demonstrate a functional response of the heterostructure devices to the
protonation of the amino groups in water. Due to its relative simplicity, the
suggested approach opens broad avenues for implementations in graphene-based
electronic devices where non-destructive chemical functionalization of graphene
is required (e.g., for engineering electrical transducers for chemical and

convergence for function classes of very high smoothness. In this paper, we
consider a search algorithm for point sets whose $t$-value and WAFOM are both
small, so as to be effective for a wider range of function classes. For this,
we fix digital $(t, m, s)$-nets with small $t$-values (e.g., Sobol' or
Niederreiter--Xing nets) in advance, apply random linear scrambling, and select
scrambled digital $(t, m, s)$-nets in terms of WAFOM. Experiments show that the

from a newly developed theory of the area under the Bessel excursion. The
latter describes the spatiotemporal correlations in the problem and is the
microscopic input needed to characterize the spatial diffusion of the atomic
cloud. A modified Montroll-Weiss (MW) equation for the density is obtained,
which depends on the statistics of velocity excursions and meanders. The
meander, a random walk in velocity space which starts at the origin and does
not cross it, describes the last jump event in the sequence. In the anomalous
phases, the statistics of meanders and excursions are essential for the
calculation of the mean square displacement, showing that our correction to the
MW equation is crucial, and points to the sensitivity of the transport on a
single jump event. Our work provides relations between the statistics of
velocity excursions and meanders and that of the diffusivity.

systems in which the set of reaction channels can be adaptively partitioned
into two subsets characterized by either ""high"" or ""low"" activity. Adaptive in
this context means that the partition evolves in time according to the states
visited by the stochastic paths of the system. To estimate expected values of
observables of the system at a prescribed final time, our method bounds the
global computational error to be below a prescribed tolerance, $TOL$, within a
given confidence level. This is achieved with a computational complexity of
order $O(TOL^{-2})$, the same as with an exact method, but with a smaller
constant. We also present a novel control variate technique based on the
stochastic time change representation by Kurtz, which may dramatically reduce
the variance of the coarsest level at a negligible computational cost. Our

metals, we study by molecular dynamics simulations the effect of a solvophilic
structured and a solvophobic unstructured wall on the phases, the crystal
nucleation and the dynamics of the fluid. We find that at low temperatures the
large density of the solvophilic wall induces a high-density, high-energy
structure in the first layer (""tempting"" effect). In turn, the first layer
induces a ""molding"" effect on the second layer determining a structure with
reduced energy and density, closer to the average density of the system. This
low-density, low-energy structure propagates further through the layers by
templating effect and can involve all the existing layers at the lowest
temperatures investigated. Therefore, although the high-density, high-energy
structure does not self-reproduce further than the first layer, the structured
wall can have a long-range effect thanks to a sequence of templating, molding
and templating effects through the layers. We find dynamical slowing down of
the solvent near the solvophilic wall but with largely heterogeneous dynamics
near the wall due to superdiffusive liquid veins within a frozen matrix of
solvent. Hence, the partial freezing of the first hydration layer does not
correspond necessarily to an effective reduction of the channel section in

suboptimal solution due to increased number of local maxima. In this work, we
have setup a simple framework for the evaluation of hardness of multi-objective
genetic algorithms (MOGA). The algorithm is designed for a pray-predator game
where a player is to improve its lifespan, challenging level and usability of
the game arena through number of generations. A rigorous set of experiments are
performed for quantifying the hardness in terms of evolution for increasing
number of objective functions. In genetic algorithm, crossover and mutation
with equal probability are applied to create offspring in each generation.
First, each objective function is maximized individually by ranking the
competing players on the basis of the fitness (cost) function, and then a
multi-objective cost function (sum of individual cost functions) is maximized
with ranking, and also without ranking where dominated solutions are also

defined only asymptotically, or otherwise obscured at best, because the
Hamiltonian is a sum of first-class constraints and a boundary term and thus
supposedly generates gauge transformations. Attention to the gauge generator G
of Rosenfeld, Anderson, Bergmann, Castellani et al., a specially tuned sum of
first-class constraints, facilitates seeing that a solitary first-class
constraint in fact generates not a gauge transformation, but a bad physical
change in electromagnetism (changing E) or GR. The change spoils the Lagrangian
constraints in terms of the physically relevant velocities rather than
auxiliary canonical momenta. While Maudlin has defended change in GR much as G.
E. Moore resisted skepticism, there remains a need to exhibit the technical
flaws in the argument.
  Insistence on Hamiltonian-Lagrangian equivalence, a theme emphasized by
Mukunda, Castellani, Sugano, Pons, Salisbury, Shepley and Sundermeyer among
others, holds the key. Taking objective change to be ineliminable time
dependence, there is change in vacuum GR just in case there is no time-like
vector field satisfying Killing's equation. Throwing away the spatial
dependence of GR for convenience, one finds that the time evolution from
Hamilton's equations is real change just when there is no time-like Killing
vector. Hence change is real and local even in the Hamiltonian formalism.
  The considerations here resolve the Earman-Maudlin standoff: the Hamiltonian
formalism is helpful, and, suitably reformed, it does not have absurd
consequences for change. Hence the classical problem of time is resolved, apart
from the issue of observables, for which the solution is outlined. The quantum
problem of time, however, is not automatically resolved due to issues of
quantum constraint imposition.

We show that the
decomposition of the qutrit Hadamard gate is non-unique and not derivable from
the dichromatic calculus. As an application of the dichromatic calculus, we
depict a quantum algorithm with a single qutrit. Since it is not easy to
decompose an arbitrary d by d unitary matrix into Z and X phase gates when d >
2, the proof of the universality of qudit ZX calculus for quantum mechanics is
far from trivial. We construct a counterexample to Ranchin's universality
proof, and give another proof by Lie theory that the qudit ZX calculus contains
all single qudit unitary transformations, which implies that qudit ZX calculus,
with qutrit dichromatic calculus as a special case, is universal for quantum
mechanics.
