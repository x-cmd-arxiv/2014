quantum mechanics stands in need of an interpretation. Ironically, this
hypothesis may appear vulnerable against arguments drawing on Putnam's own
work. Nancy Cartwright (2005) has urged that his 1962 essay on the meaning of
theoretical terms suggests that quantum mechanics needs no interpretation and
thus stands in tension with his claim of three years later. She furthermore
contends that this conflict should be resolved in favour of the earlier work,
as quantum mechanics, like all successful theories, does not need an
interpretation. The first part of this essay deflates both of these objections.
The second part addresses and evaluates Putnam's own assessments of the main
interpretative options available in 1965 and 2005. Although we may disagree on
some aspects, his pessimistic conclusion will come out largely unscathed, and,
in fact, enhanced. I will close by briefly stating the historical relevance of
this work.

pseudoscalar mesons and may decay into several different channels in a cascade
$\Phi \rightarrow L^\alpha \nu_h;\nu_h\rightarrow \{X\}$. In general these are
rare events with displaced vertices. We provide a non-perturbative and
manifestly unitary framework that describes the cascade decay and yields the
space-time evolution of the probabilities for sterile neutrinos, final states
and the total number of events at a far detector. The results are general,
valid for Dirac or Majorana neutrinos and only input the total decay rates and
branching ratios for the production and decay channels. We apply the general
results to two examples of ""visible"" decay: i) $K^+\rightarrow e^+
\nu_h\rightarrow (e^+) e^+ e^- \nu_e$ via a standard model charged current
vertex and ii) the radiative decay $K^+\rightarrow \mu^+ \nu_h \rightarrow
(\mu^+) \nu_a \gamma$. For this latter cascade process we find substantial
corrections to previous assessments within the parameter space argued to solve
the anomalous excess of electron-like events at MiniBooNE. These large
corrections may help relieve the tension with recent experimental bounds on
radiative decays of heavy sterile neutrinos.

vibrational excitation are essential inputs in many astrophysical models. When
rate coefficients are unknown, they are often estimated using known values from
other systems. The most common example is to use He-collider rate coefficients
to estimate values for other colliders, typically H$_2$, using scaling
arguments based on the reduced mass of the collision system. This procedure is
often justified by the assumption that the inelastic cross section is
independent of the collider. Here we explore the validity of this approach
focusing on rotational inelastic transitions for collisions of H, para-H$_2$,
$^3$He, and $^4$He with CO in its vibrational ground state. We compare rate
coefficients obtained via explicit calculations to those deduced by standard
reduced-mass scaling. Not surprisingly, inelastic cross sections and rate
coefficients are found to depend sensitively on both the reduced mass and the
interaction potential energy surface. We demonstrate that standard reduced-mass
scaling is not valid on physical and mathematical grounds, and as a
consequence, the common approach of multiplying a rate coefficient for a
molecule-He collision system by the constant factor of ~1.4 to estimate the
rate coefficient for para-H$_2$ collisions is deemed unreliable. Furthermore,
we test an alternative analytic scaling approach based on the strength of the
interaction potential and the reduced mass of the collision systems. Any
scaling approach, however, may be problematic when low-energy resonances are
present; explicit calculations or measurements of rate coefficients are to be
preferred.

that only authorized recipients can unmask the data. Using the sparse linear

computing. Several open-source cloud solutions are available to these supports.
Open-source software stacks offer a huge amount of customizability without huge
licensing fees. As a result, open source software are widely used for designing
cloud, and private clouds are being built increasingly in the open source way.
Numerous contributions have been made by the open-source community related to
private-IaaS-cloud. OpenNebula - a cloud platform is one of the popular private
cloud management software. However, little has been done to systematically
investigate the performance evaluation of this open-source cloud solution in
the existing literature. The performance evaluation aids new and existing
research, industry and international projects when selecting OpenNebula
software to their work. The objective of this paper is to evaluate the
load-balancing performance of the OpenNebula cloud management software. For the
performance evaluation, the OpenNebula cloud management software is installed
and configured as a prototype implementation and tested on the DIU Cloud Lab.
In this paper, two set of experiments are conducted to identify the load
balancing performance of the OpenNebula cloud management platform- (1) Delete
and Add Virtual Machine (VM) from OpenNebula cloud platform; (2) Mapping
Physical Hosts to Virtual Machines (VMs) in the OpenNebula cloud platform.

of which possess radial velocities in excess of 80 km/s. The majority of the

blueshifted components suggesting that extinction is important across
individual flows and is higher near DR21. We provide a classification scheme
for the resulting collection of position-velocity diagrams, including other

separated in radial velocity.
  We use hydrodynamic simulations with molecular cooling and chemistry to show
that these are associated with Mach discs and bow shocks. We also employ a
steady-state bow shock model to interpret other revealing position-velocity
diagrams. We consider mechanisms which can generate vibrationally-excited
hydrogen molecules moving at speeds well beyond the breakdown speed permitted
for shock excitation. We conclude that the molecules have formed within the
jets well before being excited by internal shocks triggered by impacts with the

investigated in view of the geometric scaling property of the pp amplitudes.

effective representation learning method for visual recognition tasks. In the
common scenario, a ConvNet is trained on a large labeled dataset (source) and
the feed-forward units activation of the trained network, at a certain layer of
the network, is used as a generic representation of an input image for a task
with relatively smaller training set (target). Recent studies have shown this
form of representation transfer to be suitable for a wide range of target
visual recognition tasks. This paper introduces and investigates several
factors affecting the transferability of such representations. It includes
parameters for training of the source ConvNet such as its architecture,
distribution of the training data, etc. and also the parameters of feature
extraction such as layer of the trained ConvNet, dimensionality reduction, etc.
Then, by optimizing these factors, we show that significant improvements can be
achieved on various (17) visual recognition tasks. We further show that these
visual recognition tasks can be categorically ordered based on their distance
from the source task such that a correlation between the performance of tasks
and their distance from the source task w.r.t. the proposed factors is
observed.

Correlations in particle dynamics are seen to exist not only in space (clusters

particles are more likely (than immobile particles) to have nearest neighbors
that were highly mobile in immediately preceding times. The interpretation is

homogeneously throughout a volume centred on the Earth, (ii) a survey in which
the events are homogeneously distributed, but are only detectable beyond a
certain minimum distance, and (iii) a survey in which all the events occur at
an identical distance, as is appropriate for a targetted survey of a particular
field which subtends N_point telescope pointings. For a survey of fixed
duration, T_obs, we determine the optimal tradeoff between number of telescope
pointings, N, and integration time per field. We consider a population in which
the event luminosity distribution follows a power law with index -\alpha, and
t_slew is the slewing time between fields or, for a drift scan, the time taken
for the telescope drift by one beamwidth. Several orders of magnitude
improvement in detection rate is possible by optimization of the survey
parameters. The optimal value of N for case (i) is N_max ~ T_obs/4 t_slew,
while for case (iii) we find N_max = (L_max/L_0)^2 [ (3 -\alpha)/2
]^{2/(\alpha-1)}, where L_max is the maximum luminosity of a transient event
and L_0 is the minimum luminosity event detectable in an integration of
duration T_obs. For a telescope field of view, \Omega, and a minimum detectable
flux density, S_0, the detection rate scales as N \Omega S_0^{-3/2} for
homogeneously distributed events, while for targetted events (iii) it scales as
N \Omega S_0^{1-\alpha}. The quantity \Omega S_0^{-2} is often used as the
metric of telescope performance in the SKA transients literature, but only
under special circumstances is it the metric that optimizes the event detection

$(k,\delta)$-RIP (Restricted Isometry Property) if, for any vector $x \in
\mathbb{R}^n$, with at most $k$ non-zero co-ordinates, $$(1-\delta) \|x\|_2
\leq \|A x\|_2 \leq (1+\delta)\|x\|_2$$ In many applications, such as
compressed sensing and sparse recovery, it is desirable to construct RIP
matrices with a large $k$ and a small $\delta$. Given the efficacy of random
constructions in generating useful RIP matrices, the problem of certifying the
RIP parameters of a matrix has become important.
  In this paper, we prove that it is hard to approximate the RIP parameters of
a matrix assuming the Small-Set-Expansion-Hypothesis. Specifically, we prove
that for any arbitrarily large constant $C>0$ and any arbitrarily small
constant $0<\delta<1$, there exists some $k$ such that given a matrix $M$, it
is SSE-Hard to distinguish the following two cases:
  - (Highly RIP) $M$ is $(k,\delta)$-RIP.
  - (Far away from RIP) $M$ is not $(k/C, 1-\delta)$-RIP.
  Most of the previous results on the topic of hardness of RIP certification
only hold for certification when $\delta=o(1)$. In practice, it is of interest
to understand the complexity of certifying a matrix with $\delta$ being close
to $\sqrt{2}-1$, as it suffices for many real applications to have matrices
with $\delta = \sqrt{2}-1$. Our hardness result holds for any constant
$\delta$. Specifically, our result proves that even if $\delta$ is indeed very
small, i.e. the matrix is in fact \emph{strongly RIP}, certifying that the
matrix exhibits \emph{weak RIP} itself is SSE-Hard.
  In order to prove the hardness result, we prove a variant of the Cheeger's
Inequality for sparse vectors.

A non-cooperative Stackelberg game between RUs and the SFC is proposed in order
to explore how both entities can benefit, in terms of achieved utility and
minimizing total cost respectively, from their energy trading with each other
and the grid. From the properties of the game, it is shown that the maximum
benefit to the SFC in terms of reduction in total cost is obtained at the
unique and strategy proof Stackelberg equilibrium (SE). It is further shown
that the SE is guaranteed to be reached by the SFC and RUs by executing the
proposed algorithm in a distributed fashion, where participating RUs comply
with their best strategies in response to the action chosen by the SFC. In
addition, a charging-discharging scheme is introduced for the SFC's storage
device (SD) that can further lower the SFC's total cost if the proposed game is
implemented. Numerical experiments confirm the effectiveness of the proposed
scheme.

entropy within a cosmological horizon be of order the Bekenstein entropy for a
black hole of size the cosmological horizon. We recall the earlier proposed
model of a `dense gas of black holes' to model this entropy, and discuss its
realization as a set of intersecting brane states. Finally we speculate that
the cosmological evolution of such a phase may depart from the evolution
expected from the classical Einstein equations, since the very large value of

order to investigate properties of recent warming. Our aim was to separate
changes produced by short-term ENSO variations and to look on temporal and
spatial dynamics of residual temperature anomalies. For this we subtract linear
influence of ENSO index from each HadCRUT4 grid box. We found that residual
global temperature dynamics looks like staircase function: linear trends for
three quasi-stable periods 1950-1987, 1988-1997 and 1998-2013 are near zero and
near all warming occurred during two shifts of 1987/1988 and 1997/1998 years.
  All these allows us to formulate a new hypothesis about recent warming - the
Shifts Hypothesis. It explains the structure of recent warming as follows:
during shifts of 1987/1988 and 1997/1998 the mean value of global temperature
quickly rose, over which natural variability associated with ENSO, PDO and many
other local factors occurs.
  According to IPCC forcing-response paradigm warming process (WP) cleared from
all factors should be continuous warming (may be near linear on the considered
time interval). This idea is inconsistent to the obtained staircase function.
This staircase function may be explained by current IPCC forcing-response
paradigm only if it happened so that the combination of compensating factors is
near the same as anthropogenic greenhouse gases (GHGs) forcing for each
quasi-stable period - 1950-1987, 1988-1997 and 1998-2013. This seems very
unlikely. An alternative and more simple explanation is the existence of some
regulation mechanism (e.g. global thermostat) not presented in IPCC climate
models. This mechanism should maintain global temperature near stable in
1950-1987, 1988-1997 and 1998-2013 periods nevertheless all the time growing
forcing due to anthropogenic GHGs.

prove that almost specification on the whole space induces this property on the

$\underline{d}$-shadowing and $\overline{d}$-shadowing. Finally, we study

parameters in linear mixed-effects models can be determined using the lmer
function in the lme4 package for R. As for most model-fitting functions in R,
the model is described in an lmer call by a formula, in this case including
both fixed- and random-effects terms. The formula and data together determine a
numerical representation of the model from which the profiled deviance or the
profiled REML criterion can be evaluated as a function of some of the model
parameters. The appropriate criterion is optimized, using one of the
constrained optimization functions in R, to provide the parameter estimates. We
describe the structure of the model, the steps in evaluating the profiled
deviance or REML criterion, and the structure of classes or types that
represents such a model. Sufficient detail is included to allow specialization
of these structures by users who wish to write functions to fit specialized
linear mixed models, such as models incorporating pedigrees or smoothing
splines, that are not easily expressible in the formula language used by lmer.

high frequencies, 40 pulsars (27\%) have $-$10\%$\leq\eta\leq 10$\% (group B),
meaning a marginal change in pulse width, and 29 pulsars (19\%) have
$\eta>10$\% (group C), showing a remarkable profile broadening at high

profile narrowing phenomenon at high frequencies is more common than the
profile broadening phenomenon, but a large fraction of the group-B and group-C

a portion of group-B pulsars with a slight pulse broadening, can hardly be

with particular attention to resolving the very initial stage of the process
which only recently has become accessible both experimentally and
computationally. A systematic study of the parameter space of practical
interest allows the influence of the governing parameters in the system to be
identified and the role of viscous gas to be determined. In particular, it is
shown that the viscosity of the gas suppresses the formation of toroidal bubble
predicted in some cases by early computations where the gas' dynamics was
neglected. Focussing computations on the very initial stages of coalescence and
considering the large parameter space allows us to examine the accuracy and
limits of applicability of various `scaling laws' proposed for different
`regimes' and, in doing so, reveal certain inconsistencies in recent works. A
comparison to experimental data shows that the conventional model is able to
reproduce many qualitative features of the initial stages of coalescence, such
as a collapse of calculations onto a `master curve' but, quantitatively,
overpredicts the observed speed of coalescence and there are no free parameters
to improve the fit. Finally, a phase diagram of parameter space, differing from
previously published ones, is used to illustrate the key findings.

this model's predictions differ from those of the conventionally used one, (b)
what influence the ambient fluid has on the evolution of the shape of the
coalescing drops and (c) the coupling of the intrinsic dynamics of coalescence
and that of the ambient fluid. The key feature of the interface formation model
in its application to the coalescence phenomenon is that it removes the
singularity inherent in the conventional model at the onset of coalescence and
describes the part of the free surface `trapped' between the coalescing volumes
as they are pressed against each other as a rapidly disappearing `internal
interface'. Considering the simplest possible formulation of this model, we
find experimentally-verifiable differences with the predictions of the
conventional model showing, in particular, the effect of drop size on the
coalescence process. According to the new model, for small drops a non-monotone
time-dependence of the bridge expansion speed is a feature that could be looked
for in further experimental studies. Finally, the results of both models are
compared to recently available experimental data on the evolution of the liquid
bridge connecting the coalescing drops, and the interface formation model is
seen to give a better agreement with the data.

structure. Based on earlier pioneering works on this subject, two of us
recently proposed a simple modification of QED by constructing a generalization
of the $U(1)$ charge group of QED to the ""Sky"" group incorporating the known
spontaneous Lorentz violation due to infrared photons, but still compatible in
particular with locality. There it was shown that the ""Sky"" group is generated
by the algebra of angle dependent charges and a study of its superselection
sectors has revealed a manifest description of spontaneous breaking of Lorentz
symmetry. We further elaborate this approach here and investigate in some
detail the properties of charged particles dressed by the infrared photons. We
find that Lorentz violation due to soft photons may be manifestly codified in
an angle dependent fermion mass modifying therefore the fermion dispersion
relations. The fact that the masses of the charged particles are not Lorentz
invariant affects their spin content too.Time dilation formulae for decays
should also get corrections. We speculate that these effects could be measured
possibly in muon decay experiments.

choices of the agent. We identify a family of admissible contracts for which
the optimal agent's action is explicitly characterized, and, using the recent
theory of singular changes of measures for It\^o processes, we study how
restrictive this family is. In particular, in the special case of the standard
Homlstr\""om-Milgrom model with fixed volatility, the family includes all

preferences, and show that the optimal contract is linear in these factors: the
contractible sources of risk, including the output, the quadratic variation of
the output and the cross-variations between the output and the contractible
risk sources. Thus, like sample Sharpe ratios used in practice, path-dependent
contracts naturally arise when there is moral hazard with respect to risk

significant if the principal does not use the quadratic variation component of
the optimal contract.

The multitude of ground state phases are characterized in detail in terms of

arrangements for the plateau phases are identified by calculating the static
structure factors. The enlarged local Hilbert space of the $S=1$ spins results
in several new ground state phases that are not realized for $S=1/2$ spins.
These include the quantum paramagnetic state that is ubiquitous to $S=1$ spins
with single ion anisotropy, two different spin supersolid phases (with distinct
longitudinal ordering) and a magnetization plateau that arises as a direct
descendant of the 1/3 plateau due to quantum fluctuations that are not possible
for $S=1/2$ spins. We predict the same mechanism will lead to plateaus at
smaller fractions of 1/3 for higher spins. The full momentum dependence of the

quantum field theory. However, in some systems entanglement can be dominated by
""internal"", possibly gauged, degrees of freedom that are not spatially
organized, and that can give rise to gaps smaller than the inverse size of the
system. In a holographic context, such small gaps are associated to the
appearance of horizons and singularities in the dual spacetime. Here, we
propose a concept of entwinement, which is intended to capture this fine
structure of the wavefunction. Holographically, entwinement probes the
entanglement shadow -- the region of spacetime not probed by the minimal
surfaces that compute spatial entanglement in the dual field theory. We
consider the simplest example of this scenario -- a 2d conformal field theory
(CFT) that is dual to a conical defect in AdS3 space. Following our previous
work, we show that spatial entanglement in the CFT reproduces spacetime
geometry up to a finite distance from the conical defect. We then show that the
interior geometry up to the defect can be reconstructed from entwinement that
is sensitive to the discretely gauged, fractionated degrees of freedom of the
CFT. Entwinement in the CFT is related to non-minimal geodesics in the conical
defect geometry, suggesting a potential quantum information theoretic meaning
for these objects in a holographic context. These results may be relevant for
the reconstruction of black hole interiors from a dual field theory.

Cam's theory. The experiments are a continuously observed diffusion with
nonparametric drift and its Euler scheme. We focus on diffusions with
nonconstant-known diffusion coefficient. The asymptotic equivalence is proved
by constructing explicit equivalence mappings based on random time changes. The
equivalence of the discretized observation of the diffusion and the
corresponding Euler scheme experiment is then derived. The impact of these
equivalence results is that it justifies the use of the Euler scheme instead of
the discretized diffusion process for inference purposes.

data, we extracted light curves from the pixel photometric data of the Kepler
space telescope for 15 Blazhko RR Lyrae stars. For collecting all the flux from
a given target as accurately as possible, we defined tailor-made apertures for
each star and quarter. In some cases the aperture finding process yielded
sub-optimal result, because some flux have been lost even if the aperture
contains all available pixels around the star. This fact stresses the
importance of those methods that rely on the whole light curve instead of
focusing on the extrema (O-C diagrams and other amplitude independent methods).
We carried out detailed Fourier analysis of the light curves and the amplitude
independent O-C diagram. We found 12 (80%) multiperiodically modulated stars in
our sample. This ratio is much higher than previously found. Resonant coupling
between radial modes, a recent theory to explain of the Blazhko effect, allows
single, multiperiodic or even chaotic modulations. Among the stars with two
modulations we found three stars (V355 Lyr, V366 Lyr and V450 Lyr) where one of
the periods dominate in amplitude modulation, but the other period has larger
frequency modulation amplitude. The ratio between the primary and secondary
modulation periods is almost always very close to ratios of small integer
numbers. It may indicate the effect of undiscovered resonances. Furthermore, we
detected the excitation of the second radial overtone mode $f_2$ for three
stars where this feature was formerly unknown. Our data set comprises the
longest continuous, most precise observations of Blazhko RR Lyrae stars ever
published. These data which is made publicly available will be unprecedented
for years to come.

of galaxies, such as the extent of the initial HII region before its fusion
with the UV background and the duration of its propagation. We use a set of
reionisation simulations with different resolutions and ionizing source
recipes. A catalog of the HII regions properties is built thanks to a merger
tree of HII regions. We draw local reionization histories as a function of time
and investigate variations according to the halo mass progenitors of the
regions. We then extrapolate the halo mass inside the region from high z to z=0
to make predictions about the reionization histories of z=0 galaxies. We found
that the later an HII region appears, the smaller will be its related lifetime
and volume before it sees the global UV background. Quantitatively the duration
and the extent of the initial growth of an HII region is strongly dependent on
the mass of the inner halo and can be as long as 50 % of the reionization
epoch. We found that the most massive is a halo today, the earlier it appears
and the larger are the extension and the duration of propagation of its HII
region. Quantitative predictions differ depending on the box size or the source
model: small simulated volumes are affected by proximity effects between HII
regions and halo-based source models predict smaller regions and slower I-front
expansion than in models using star particles as ionizing sources. Our results
suggests that Milky Way-type halos have a maximal extent of 1.1 Mpc/h for the
initial HII region that established itself in 150-200$\pm 20$ Myrs. This is
consistent with prediction made using constrained Local Group simulation.
Considering halos with masses comparable to those of the Local Group (MW+M31),
our result suggests that statistically it has not been influenced by an
external front coming from a Virgo-like cluster.

perturbations to study spatial evolutionary games on $Z^d$, $d\ge 3$ when the
interaction kernel is finite range, symmetric, and has covariance matrix
$\sigma^2I$. The games we consider have payoff matrices of the form ${\bf 1} +
wG$ where ${\bf 1}$ is matrix of all 1's and $w$ is small and positive. Since
our population size $N=\infty$, we call our selection small rather than weak
which usually means $w =O(1/N)$.
  The key to studying these games is the fact that when the dynamics are
suitably rescaled in space and time they convergence to solutions of a reaction
diffusion equation (RDE). Inspired by work of Ohtsuki and Nowak and Tarnita et
al we show that the reaction term is the replicator equation for a modified
game matrix and the modifications of the game matrix depend on the interaction
kernel only through the values of two or three simple probabilities for an
associated coalescing random walk.
  Two strategy games lead to an RDE with a cubic nonlinearity, so we can
describe the phase diagram completely. Three strategy games lead to a pair of
coupled RDE, but using an idea from our earlier work, we are able to show that
if there is a repelling function for the replicator equation for the modified
game, then there is coexistence in the spatial game when selection is small.
This enables us to prove coexistence in the spatial model in a wide variety of
examples where the replicator equation of the modified game has an attracting
equilibrium with all components positive. Using this result we are able to
analyze the behavior of four evolutionary games that have recently been used in
cancer modeling.

Exponentially Fitted (EF) rules depend on frequency dependent nodes which start
off at the Gauss-Legendre nodes when the frequency is zero and end up at the

rules well suited for small as well as for large frequencies. However, the
computation of the EF nodes is expensive due to iteration and ill-conditioning.
This issue can be resolved by making the connection with Filon-type rules. By
introducing some $S$-shaped functions, we show how Gauss-type rules with
frequency dependent nodes can be constructed, which have an optimal asymptotic
rate of decay of the error with increasing frequency and which are effective
also for small or moderate frequencies. These frequency-dependent nodes can

dimension, and to a (measure-valued) solution to the deterministic Fisher-KPP
equation in more than one dimension. When large-scale extinction-recolonisation
events occur, the sequence of processes converges instead to the solution to
the analogous equation in which the Laplacian is replaced by a fractional
Laplacian. We also consider the process of `potential ancestors' of a sample of
individuals taken from these populations, which we see as a system of branching
and coalescing symmetric jump processes. We show their convergence in
distribution towards a system of Brownian or stable motions which branch at
some finite rate. In one dimension, in the limit, pairs of particles also
coalesce at a rate proportional to their collision local time.

curious, i.e., an eavesdropper that conforms to the system rules and applies
the intended relaying scheme. We start with the general case of the
single-input multiple-output (SIMO) L-user multi-way relay channel and provide
an achievable secrecy rate region under a weak secrecy criterion. We show that
the securely achievable sum rate is equivalent to the difference between the
computation rate and the multiple access channel (MAC) capacity. Particularly,
we show that all nodes must encode their messages such that the common
computation rate tuple falls outside the MAC capacity region of the relay. We
provide results for the single-input single-output (SISO) and the
multiple-input single-input (MISO) L-user multi-way relay channel as well as
the two-way relay channel. We discuss these results and show the dependency
between channel realization and achievable secrecy rate. We further compare our

In such presentation, the usual conformal weight of fields can be encoded as
local dilatation group gauge charges. The conventional conformal invariance of
Lagrangians is then equivalent to dilatation gauge invariance. The claim of the
paper is, that the most commonly occurring conformally invariant Lagrangians
turning up in physics are not only invariant to local dilatation gauge
transformations, but they are also invariant to any change of the dilatation
gauge connection, meaning an additional algebraic symmetry property. In terms
of dimensional analysis and differential geometry, this additional symmetry
means complete insensitivity of the Lagrangian to the choice of the parallel

in which a reliable measurement of galaxy correlations is possible. This
corresponds to determine the shape of the correlation function, its possible
evolution with redshift and the size and amplitude of large scale structures.
Different selection effects, inevitably entering in any observation, introduce
important constraints in the measurement of correlations. In the context of
galaxy redshift surveys selection effects can be caused by observational
techniques and strategies and by implicit assumptions used in the data
analysis. Generally all these effects are taken into account by using
pair-counting algorithms to measure two-point correlations. We review these
methods stressing that they are based on the a-priori assumption that galaxy
distribution is spatially homogeneous inside a given sample. We show that, when
this assumption is not satisfied by the data, results of the correlation
analysis are affected by finite size effects.In order to quantify these
effects, we introduce a new method based on the computation of the gradient of
galaxy counts along tiny cylinders. We show, by using artificial homogeneous
and inhomogeneous point distributions, that this method is to identify redshift
dependent selection effects and to disentangle them from the presence of large
scale density fluctuations. We then apply this new method to several redshift
catalogs and we find evidences that galaxy distribution, in those samples where
selection effects are small enough, is characterized by power-law correlations
with exponent $\gamma=0.9$ up to $20$ Mpc/h followed by a change of slope that,
in the range [20,100] Mpc/h, corresponds to a power-law exponent $\gamma=0.25$.
Whether a crossover to spatial unformity occurs at $\sim 100$ Mpc/h cannot be
clarified by the present data.

the rescaled remainder functions at strong coupling with those at two, three

that the metallicity spread ~ 6 Gyr ago is remarkable large, while the
intrinsic metallicity dispersion at ~ 1-2 Gyr results smaller than that for the

bolometric luminosity range (log L ~ 46.1 +/- 0.4 [\ergss]), some of the most
luminous local (z < 0.6) quasars with some of the lowest luminosity sources yet

obtained with the 10.4m Gran Telescopio Canarias (GTC) while the HST (largely
FOS) archive provides a low redshift control sample. Comparison is made in the
context of the 4D Eigenvector 1 formalism meaning that we divide both source
samples into high accreting Population A and low accreting Population B
sources. Results: CIV 1549 shows very similar properties at both redshifts
confirming at high redshift the CIV profile differences between Pop. A and B
that are well established in local quasars. The CIV blueshift that appears
quasi- ubiquitous in higher L sources is found in only half (Pop. A) of quasars
observed in both of our samples. A CIV evolutionary Baldwin effect is certainly
disfavored. We find evidence for lower metallicity in the GTC sample that may
point toward a gradient with z. No evidence for a gradient in black hole mass
or Eddington ratio is found. Conclusions: Spectroscopic differences established
at low redshift are also present in much higher redshift quasars. Given that
our samples involve sources with very similar luminosity the evidence for a
systematic metallicity decrease, if real, points toward an evolutionary effect.
Our samples appear representative of a slow evolving quasar population likely
present at all redshifts.

greater than their delay spread. In such cases it can be shown that in the
infinite bandwidth limit the information capacity tends to that of a channel
with perfect receiver Channel State Information (CSI). This paper presents a
lower bound on the capacity of a channel with finite bandwidth, expressed in a
form which is mathematically elegant, and computationally simple. The bounding
method exploits the fact that most actual channels are highly underspread; and
that typically more is known about their impulse response than the channel time
variation. The capacity is lower bounded by finding an achievable rate for
individual time blocks which are shorter than the channel coherence time, in an
orthogonal frequency division multiplexing system model. A highly underspread
channel of particular interest is the invehicle channel, and a numerical
example is given to verify that the capacity is indeed approximately that of a
channel with perfect receiver CSI. The resulting lower bound is shown to be
tighter than those previously derived.

calculated by means of a thermodynamic integration along a path between a
totally H-disordered state and one fulfilling the Bernal-Fowler ice rules. A
Monte Carlo procedure based on a simple energy model is used, so that the
employed thermodynamic path drives the system from high temperatures to the
low-temperature limit. This method turns out to be precise enough to give
reliable values for the configurational entropy of different ice phases in the
thermodynamic limit (number of molecules N --> infinity). The precision of the
method is checked for the ice model on a two-dimensional square lattice.
Results for the configurational entropy are given for H-disordered arrangements
on several polymorphs, including ices Ih, Ic, II, III, IV, V, VI, and XII. The
highest and lowest entropy values correspond to ices VI and XII, respectively,
with a difference of 3.3\% between them. The dependence of the entropy on the
ice structures has been rationalized by comparing it with structural parameters
of the various polymorphs, such as the mean ring size. A particularly good
correlation has been found between the configurational entropy and the
connective constant derived from self-avoiding walks on the ice networks.

astrophysics may only be measured using indirect techniques due to small cross
sections at the energy of interest. One of such indirect technique, is to
determine the Asymptotic Normalization Coefficients (ANC) for near threshold
resonances extracted from sub-Coulomb $\alpha$-transfer reactions. This
approach provides a very valuable tool for studies of astrophysically important
reaction rates since the results are practically model independent. However,
the validity of the method has not been directly verified.
  Purpose. The aim of this letter is to verify the technique using the
$^{16}$O($^6$Li,$d$)$^{20}$Ne reaction as a benchmark. The $^{20}$Ne nucleus
has a well known $1^-$ state at excitation energy of 5.79 MeV with a width of
28 eV. Reproducing the known value with this technique is an ideal opportunity
to verify the method.
  Method. The 1$^-$ state at 5.79 MeV is studied using the $\alpha$-transfer
reaction $^{16}$O($^6$Li,$d$)$^{20}$Ne at sub-Coulomb energies.
  Results. The partial $\alpha$ width for the $1^-$ state at excitation energy
of 5.79 MeV is extracted and compared with the known value, allowing the
accuracy of the method to be evaluated.
  Conclusions. This study demonstrates that extracting the Asymptotic
Normalization Coefficients using sub-Coulomb $\alpha$-transfer reactions is a
powerful tool that can be used to determine the partial $\alpha$ width of near
threshold states that may dominate astrophysically important nuclear reaction
rates. \end{description}

  Sequential Data","35 pages, 1 figure",,,,"stat.ME math.ST stat.TH","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The $\gamma$-FDP and $k$-FWER multiple testing error metrics, which are tail
probabilities of the respective error statistics, have become popular recently
as less-stringent alternatives to the FDR and FWER. We propose general and
flexible stepup and stepdown procedures for testing multiple hypotheses about
sequential (or streaming) data that simultaneously control both the type I and
II versions of $\gamma$-FDP, or $k$-FWER. The error control holds regardless of
the dependence between data streams, which may be of arbitrary size and shape.
All that is needed is a test statistic for each data stream that controls the
conventional type I and II error probabilities, and no information or
assumptions are required about the joint distribution of the statistics or data
streams. The procedures can be used with sequential, group sequential,
truncated, or other sampling schemes. We give recommendations for the
procedures' implementation including closed-form expressions for the needed
critical values in some commonly-encountered testing situations. The proposed
sequential procedures are compared with each other and with comparable fixed
sample size procedures in the context of strongly positively correlated
Gaussian data streams. For this setting we conclude that both the stepup and
stepdown sequential procedures provide substantial savings over the fixed
sample procedures in terms of expected sample size, and the stepup procedure
performs slightly but consistently better than the stepdown for $\gamma$-FDP
control, with the relationship reversed for $k$-FWER control.

technique to reduce the latency perceived by end users, while jointly
offloading network traffic. While the cache hit-ratio is generally considered
in the literature as the dominant performance metric for such type of systems,
in this paper we argue that a critical missing piece has so far been neglected.
Adopting a radically different perspective, in this paper we explicitly account
for the cost of content retrieval, i.e. the cost associated to the external
bandwidth needed by an ISP to retrieve the contents requested by its customers.
Interestingly, we discover that classical cache provisioning techniques that
maximize cache efficiency (i.e., the hit-ratio), lead to suboptimal solutions
with higher overall cost. To show this mismatch, we propose two optimization
models that either minimize the overall costs or maximize the hit-ratio,
jointly providing cache sizing, object placement and path selection. We
formulate a polynomial-time greedy algorithm to solve the two problems and
analytically prove its optimality. We provide numerical results and show that
significant cost savings are attainable via a cost-aware design.

  Our purpose is to study several of the positivity notions studied for vector

variety itself, rather than on the projectivization of the given vector bundle.
We relate some of the different notions conjectured to be equivalent with the

  In particular, we define augmented and restricted base loci $\mathbb{B}_+

generalizations of the corresponding notions studied extensively for line
bundles. As it turns out, the asymptotic base loci defined here behave well

consists of a set of `actors' and a set of `events' where ties indicate an
actor's participation in an event. Although networks describe a variety of
consequential social structures, statistical methods for studying affiliation
networks are less well developed than methods for studying one-mode, or
actor-actor, networks. One way to analyze affiliation networks is to consider
one-mode network matrices that are derived from an affiliation network, but
this approach may lead to the loss of important structural features of the
data. The most comprehensive approach is to study both actors and events
simultaneously. In this paper, we extend the bilinear mixed-effects model, a
type of latent space model developed for one-mode networks, to the affiliation
network setting by considering the dependence patterns in the interactions
between actors and events and describe a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm for
Bayesian inference. We use our model to explore patterns in extracurricular
activity membership of students in a racially-diverse high school in a
Midwestern metropolitan area. Using techniques from spatial point pattern
analysis, we show how our model can provide insight into patterns of racial
segregation in the voluntary extracurricular activity participation profiles of
adolescents.

It is
unique in combining three different spreading strategies: local probing,
neighbourhood probing, and global probing. We propose a mathematical model that
combines three modes of spreading, local, neighbourhood and global to capture
the worm's spreading behaviour. The parameters of the model are inferred
directly from network data obtained during the first day of the Conifcker
epidemic. The model is then used to explore the trade-off between spreading
modes in determining the worm's effectiveness. Our results show that the
Conficker epidemic is an example of a critically hybrid epidemic, in which the
different modes of spreading in isolation do not lead to successful epidemics.
Such hybrid spreading strategies may be used beneficially to provide the most
effective strategies for promulgating information across a large population.
When used maliciously, however, they can present a dangerous challenge to
current internet security protocols.

  from RNA-seq Data","PhD thesis, 139 pages",,,,"cs.DS cs.CE q-bio.QM","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this thesis, we address the problem of identifying and quantifying
variants (alternative splicing and genomic polymorphism) in RNA-seq data when
no reference genome is available, without assembling the full transcripts.
Based on the fundamental idea that each variant corresponds to a recognizable
pattern, a bubble, in a de Bruijn graph constructed from the RNA-seq reads, we
propose a general model for all variants in such graphs. We then introduce an
exact method, called KisSplice, to extract alternative splicing events.
Finally, we show that it enables to identify more correct events than general
purpose transcriptome assemblers.
  In order to deal with ever-increasing volumes of NGS data, we put an extra
effort to make KisSplice as scalable as possible. First, to improve its running
time, we propose a new polynomial delay algorithm to enumerate bubbles. We show
that it is several orders of magnitude faster than previous approaches. Then,
to reduce its memory consumption, we propose a new compact way to build and
represent a de Bruijn graph. We show that our approach uses 30% to 40% less
memory than the state of the art, with an insignificant impact on the
construction time.
  Additionally, we apply the same techniques developed to list bubbles in two
classical problems: cycle enumeration and the K-shortest paths problem. We give
the first optimal algorithm to list cycles in undirected graphs, improving over
Johnson's algorithm. This is the first improvement to this problem in almost 40
years. We then consider a different parameterization of the classical
K-shortest (simple) paths problem: instead of bounding the number of st-paths,
we bound the weight of the st-paths. We present new algorithms with the same
time complexities but using exponentially less memory than previous approaches.

  $(k,l)$-means","14 pages",,,,"cs.LG cs.CV cs.IR stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Finding the optimal $k$-means clustering is NP-hard in general and many
heuristics have been designed for minimizing monotonically the $k$-means
objective. We first show how to extend Lloyd's batched relocation heuristic and
Hartigan's single-point relocation heuristic to take into account empty-cluster
and single-point cluster events, respectively. Those events tend to
increasingly occur when $k$ or $d$ increases, or when performing several
restarts. First, we show that those special events are a blessing because they
allow to partially re-seed some cluster centers while further minimizing the
$k$-means objective function. Second, we describe a novel heuristic,
merge-and-split $k$-means, that consists in merging two clusters and splitting
this merged cluster again with two new centers provided it improves the
$k$-means objective. This novel heuristic can improve Hartigan's $k$-means when
it has converged to a local minimum. We show empirically that this
merge-and-split $k$-means improves over the Hartigan's heuristic which is the
{\em de facto} method of choice. Finally, we propose the $(k,l)$-means
objective that generalizes the $k$-means objective by associating the data
points to their $l$ closest cluster centers, and show how to either directly
convert or iteratively relax the $(k,l)$-means into a $k$-means in order to
reach better local minima.

physics text-book result known as the Kronig-Penney model. Our generalised
model can be used to describe systems such as degenerate Fermi gases
interacting with ions or with another neutral atomic species confined in an
optical lattice, thus enabling the investigation of polaron or Kondo physics
within a simple formalism. We focus our attention on the specific atom-ion
system and compare our findings with quantum defect theory. Excellent agreement
is obtained within the regime of validity of the pseudopotential approximation.
This enables us to derive a Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonian for a degenerate quantum
Bose gas in a linear chain of ions.

atmosphere of solar spicules, we solve linear and non-ideal MHD equations in
the x-z plane. In the linear analysis it is assumed that resistivity is only
important within the current sheet, and the exponential growth of energies
takes place faster as plasma resistivity increases. We are interested to see
the occurrence of magnetic reconnection during the lifetime of a typical solar

considering that they are sparse in the DCT transformation domain. Two

coefficients to zero. In the other case the original image is considered
without pre-processing, assuming the sparsity as intrinsic property of the
analyzed image. A gradient based algorithm is used to recover a large number of
missing pixels in the image. The case of a salt-and-paper noise affecting a
large number of pixels is easily reduced to the case of missing pixels and
considered within the same framework. The reconstruction of images affected
with salt-and-paper impulsive is compared with the images filtered using a
median filter. The same algorithm can be used considering transformation of the
whole image. Reconstructions of black and white and colour images are
considered.
