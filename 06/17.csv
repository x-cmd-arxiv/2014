  minor","7 pages, 2 figures",,,,"cs.DS cs.CC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A graph $H$ is single-crossing if it can be drawn in the plane with at most
one crossing. For any single-crossing graph $H$, we give an $O(n^4)$ time
algorithm for counting perfect matchings in graphs excluding $H$ as a minor.
The runtime can be lowered to $O(n^{1.5})$ when $G$ excludes $K_5$ or $K_{3,3}$
as a minor. This is the first generalization of an algorithm for counting
perfect matchings in $K_{3,3}$-free graphs (Little 1974, Vazirani 1989). Our
algorithm uses black-boxes for counting perfect matchings in planar graphs and
for computing certain graph decompositions. Together with an independent recent
result (Straub et al. 2014) for graphs excluding $K_5$, it is one of the first
nontrivial algorithms to not inherently rely on Pfaffian orientations.

  29 June 2015",,,"Preprint NORDITA-2014-79","physics.flu-dyn","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We study a flame propagating in the gaseous combustible mixture with
suspended inert particles. The gas is assumed to be transparent for the
radiation emitted by the combustion products, while particles absorb and
re-emit the radiation. Thermal radiation heats the particles, which in turn
transfer the heat to the surrounding gaseous mixture by means of heat
conduction, so that the gas temperature lags that of the particles. We consider
different scenarios depending on the spatial distribution of the particles,
their size and the number density. In the case of uniform distribution of the
particles the radiation causes a modest increase of the temperature ahead of
the flame and the corresponding increase of the flame velocity. The effects of
radiation preheating is stronger for a flame with smaller normal velocity. In
the case of non-uniform distribution of the particles, such that the particles
number density is smaller just ahead of the flame and increases in the distant
region ahead of the flame, the preheating caused by the thermal radiation may
trigger additional independent source of ignition. This scenario requires the
formation of a temperature gradient with the maximum temperature sufficient for
ignition in the region of denser particles cloud ahead of the advancing flame.
Depending on the steepness of the temperature gradient formed in the unburned
mixture, either deflagration or detonation can be initiated via the Zeldovich's
gradient mechanism. The ignition and the resulting combustion regimes depend on
the temperature profile which is formed in effect of radiation absorption and
gas-dynamic expansion. In the case of coal dust flames propagating through a
layered dust cloud the effect of radiation heat transfer can result in the
propagation of combustion wave with velocity up to 1000m/s and can be a
plausible explanation of the origin of dust explosion in coal mines.

knocked out of synchrony by a nova explosion before observing records began,
the magnetic white dwarf in V1432 Aql is currently rotating slower than the

synchronism should be achieved around 2100. The continually changing trajectory
of the accretion stream as it follows the magnetic field lines of the rotating

employing one-to-one coupling of crystals to photodetectors to achieve enhanced
spatial resolution and contrast, the calibration task is even more daunting
because of the large number of independent channels involved. To cope with the
additional complexity of the calibration and quality control procedures of
these scanners, an intelligent system (IS) was designed to perform fault
detection and diagnosis (FDD) of malfunctioning channels. The IS can be broken
down into four hierarchical modules: parameter extraction, channel fault
detection, fault prioritization and diagnosis. Of these modules, the first two
have previously been reported and this paper focuses on fault prioritization
and diagnosis. The purpose of the fault prioritization module is to help the
operator to zero in on the faults that need immediate attention. The fault
diagnosis module will then identify the causes of the malfunction and propose
an explanation of the reasons that lead to the diagnosis. The FDD system was
implemented on a LabPET avalanche photodiode (APD)-based digital PET scanner.
Experiments demonstrated a FDD Sensitivity of 99.3 % (with a 95% confidence
interval (CI) of: [98.7, 99.9]) for major faults. Globally, the Balanced
Accuracy of the diagnosis for varying fault severities is 92 %. This suggests
the IS can greatly benefit the operators in their maintenance task.

development of this field, which has accelerated in the past 10 years to become
one of the fastest growing areas of statistics, fueled by the growing number of
applications yielding this type of data. One unique characteristic of FDA is
the need to combine information both across and within functions, which Ramsay

will focus on functional regression, the area of FDA that has received the most
attention in applications and methodological development. First will be an
introduction to basis functions, key building blocks for regularization in
functional regression methods, followed by an overview of functional regression
methods, split into three types: [1] functional predictor regression

regularization will be discussed and the methodological development described
in a roughly chronological manner, at times deviating from the historical
timeline to group together similar methods. The primary focus is on modeling
and methodology, highlighting the modeling structures that have been developed
and the various regularization approaches employed. At the end is a brief

orbiting M dwarfs shed light on the possible dependence of planet formation and
evolution on stellar mass. However, such analyses must control for other
factors, i.e. metallicity, a stellar parameter which strongly influences the
occurrence of gas giant planets. We obtained infrared spectra of 121 M dwarfs
stars monitored by the California Planet Search (CPS) and determined
metallicities with an accuracy of 0.08 dex. The mean and standard deviation of
the sample is -0.05 and 0.20 dex, respectively. We parameterized the
metallicity dependence of the occurrence of giant planets on orbits with period
less than 2 yr around solar-type stars and applied this to our M dwarf sample
to estimate the expected number of giant planets. The number of detected
planets (3) is lower than the predicted number (6.4) but the difference is not
very significant (12% probability of finding as many or fewer planets). The
three M dwarf planet hosts are not especially metal rich and the most likely
value of the power-law index relating planet occurrence to metallicity is 1.06
dex per dex for M dwarfs compared to 1.80 for solar-type stars; this
difference, however, is comparable to uncertainties. Giant planet occurrence
around both types of stars allows, but does not necessarily require, mass
dependence of $\sim 1$ dex per dex. The actual planet-mass-metallicity relation
may be complex and elucidating it will require larger surveys like those to be
conducted by ground-based infrared spectrographs and the Gaia space astrometry

exhibit critical behavior for which at the critical value of the control
parameter the inverse cascade stops. In the vicinity of such a critical point
standard phenomenological estimates for the energy balance will fail since the
energy flux towards large length scales becomes zero. We demonstrate these
concepts using the computationally tractable model of two-dimensional
magneto-hydrodynamics in a periodic box. In the absence of any external
magnetic forcing the system reduces to hydrodynamic fluid turbulence with an
inverse energy cascade. In the presence of strong magnetic forcing the system
behaves as 2D magneto-hydrodynamic turbulence with forward energy cascade. As
the amplitude of the magnetic forcing is varied a critical value is met for
which the energy flux towards the large scales becomes zero. Close to this
point the energy flux scales as a power law with the departure from the
critical point and the normalized amplitude of the fluctuations diverges.
Similar behavior is observed for the flux of the square vector potential for
which no inverse flux is observed for weak magnetic forcing, while a finite
inverse flux is observed for magnetic forcing above the critical point. We
conjecture that this behavior is generic for systems of variable inverse
cascade.

are considered as autonomous decision-makers that sense their environment and
that implement optimal transmission schemes. It is essential that these
autonomous devices cooperate and coordinate their actions, to ensure the
reliability of the transmissions and the stability of the network. We study a
point-to-point scenario in which the encoder and the decoder implement
decentralized policies that are coordinated. The coordination is measured in
terms of empirical frequency of symbols of source and channel. The encoder and
the decoder perform a coding scheme such that the empirical distribution of the
symbols is close to a target joint probability distribution. We characterize
the set of achievable target probability distributions for a point-to-point
source-channel model, in which the encoder is non-causal and the decoder is
strictly causal i.e., it returns an action based on the observation of the past
channel outputs. The objectives of the encoder and of the decoder, are captured
by some utility function, evaluated with respect to the set of achievable
target probability distributions. In this article, we investigate the
maximization problem of a utility function that is common to both encoder and
decoder. We show that the compression and the transmission of information are
particular cases of the empirical coordination.

aimed at measuring neutrino oscillations requires an accurate description of

the treatment of nuclear effects, which is one of the main sources of
systematics for accelerator based experiments such as the Long Baseline
Neutrino Experiment (LBNE). A considerable effort is currently being made to
develop theoretical models capable of providing a fully quantitative
description of the neutrino-nucleus cross sections in the kinematical regime
relevant to LBNE. The approach based on nuclear many-body theory and the
spectral function formalism has proved very successful in explaining the
available electron scattering data in a variety of kinematical conditions. The
first step towards its application to the analysis of neutrino data is the
derivation of the spectral functions of nuclei employed in neutrino detectors,
in particular argon. We propose a measurement of the coincidence $(e,e^\prime
p)$ cross section on argon. This data will provide the experimental input
indispensable to construct the argon spectral function, thus paving the way for
a reliable estimate of the neutrino cross sections. In addition, the analysis
of the $(e,e^\prime p)$ data will help a number of theoretical developments,
like the description of final-state interactions needed to isolate the
initial-state contributions to the observed single-particle peaks, that is also
needed for the interpretation of the signal detected in neutrino experiments.

contains multiple dense cores, one of them recently found associated with a
Keplerian rotating disk. We used ALMA to observe the G35.20N region in the
continuum and line emission at 350 GHz. The observed frequency range covers
tracers of dense gas (e.g. H13CO+, C17O), molecular outflows (e.g. SiO), and
hot cores (e.g. CH3CN, CH3OH). The ALMA 870 um continuum emission map reveals
an elongated dust structure (0.15 pc long and 0.013 pc wide) perpendicular to
the large-scale molecular outflow detected in the region, and fragmented into a
number of cores with masses 1-10 Msun and sizes 1600 AU. The cores appear
regularly spaced with a separation of 0.023 pc. The emission of dense gas
tracers such as H13CO+ or C17O is extended and coincident with the dust
elongated structure. The three strongest dust cores show emission of complex
organic molecules characteristic of hot cores, with temperatures around 200 K,
and relative abundances 0.2-2x10^(-8) for CH3CN and 0.6-5x10^(-6) for CH3OH.
The two cores with highest mass (cores A and B) show coherent velocity fields,
with gradients almost aligned with the dust elongated structure. Those velocity
gradients are consistent with Keplerian disks rotating about central masses of
4-18 Msun. Perpendicular to the velocity gradients we have identified a
large-scale precessing jet/outflow associated with core B, and hints of an
east-west jet/outflow associated with core A. The elongated dust structure in
G35.20N is fragmented into a number of dense cores that may form massive stars.
Based on the velocity field of the dense gas, the orientation of the magnetic
field, and the regularly spaced fragmentation, we interpret this elongated
structure as the densest part of a 1D filament fragmenting and forming massive
stars.

recent DMRG results on much larger systems. Our results suggest a phase
transition between a long-range incommensurate spiral ordered phase, and a more
subtle phase with short-range spiral correlations with the $q$-vector
describing the incommensurate correlations varying smoothly through the
transition. In the latter phase correlations between next-nearest chains
exhibits an extremely close competition between predominantly antiferromagnetic
and ferromagnetic correlations. Further analysis suggests that the
antiferromagnetic next-nearest chain correlations may be slightly stronger than
the ferromagnetic ones. This difference is found to be slight but in line with
previous renormalization group predictions of a collinear antiferromagnetic

creating two-dimensional optical dipole potentials for ultracold neutral atoms.
When combined with an attractive or repulsive Gaussian sheet formed by an
astigmatically focused beam, atoms are trapped in three dimensions resulting in
planar confinement with an arbitrary network of potentials -- a free-space atom
chip. The first approach utilizes an adaptation of the generalized
phase-contrast technique to convert a phase structure embedded in a beam after
traversing a phase mask, to an identical intensity profile in the image plane.
Phase masks, and a requisite phase-contrast filter, can be chemically etched
into optical material (e.g., fused silica) or implemented with spatial light
modulators; etching provides the highest quality while spatial light modulators
enable prototyping and realtime structure modification. This approach was
demonstrated on an ensemble of thermal atoms. Amplitude shaping is possible
when the potential structure is made as an opaque mask in the path of a dipole
trap beam, followed by imaging the shadow onto the plane of the atoms. While
much more lossy, this very simple and inexpensive approach can produce dipole
potentials suitable for containing degenerate gases. High-quality amplitude
masks can be produced with standard photolithography techniques. Amplitude
shaping was demonstrated on a Bose-Einsten condensate.

construction of supersonic kinks which can propagate in the lattice within a
large range of energies and velocities. The interparticle distances in the
lattice kinks with high energy are physically reasonable values. The
introduction of the periodic lattice potential results in the important feature
that the kinks propagate with a single velocity and a single energy which are
independent on the excitation conditions. The found kinks are ultra-discrete
and can be described with the ""magic wave number"" $q\simeq 2\pi/3a$, which was
previously revealed in the nonlinear sinusoidal waves and supersonic kinks in
the Fermi-Pasta-Ulam lattice. The extreme discreteness of the supersonic kinks,
with basically two particles moving at the same time, allows the interpretation
of their double-kink structure. The energy of the supersonic kinks is between
the possible source of $^{40}$K recoil in beta decay and the energy necessary

direct tunneling processes cause decoherence and the entanglement as well as
spin correlations decay exponentially fast. At zero voltage or small voltages

tensor on a Schwarzschild background, the Bousso covariant entropy bound, and
the ER=EPR conjecture of Maldacena and Susskind taken together suggest a
scenario for the evaporation of a large spherically symmetric black hole formed
in gravitational collapse in which 1) the classical r = 0 singularity is
replaced by an initially small non-singular core inside an inner apparent
horizon, 2) the radius of the core grows with time due to the increasing
entanglement between Hawking radiation quanta outside the black hole and the
Hawking partner quanta in the core contributing to the quantum back-reaction,
and 3) by the Page time the trapped surfaces disappear and all quantum
information stored in the interior is free to escape. The scenario preserves
unitarity without any need for a ""firewall"" in the vicinity of the outer
apparent horizon. Qbits in the Hawking radiation are never mutually entangled,
and their number never exceeds the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy of the black
hole. The quantum back-reaction, while it must be very large in the deep
interior of the black hole, can be described semi-classically in the vicinity
of the outer apparent horizon up until close to the Page time. An explicit toy
model for the metric in the interior of the black hole, and how its associated
energy-momentum tensor can be continued to the exterior in a semi-classical
approximation, is discussed.

constraints related to the connectivity of the underlying network. We then
provide a totally distributed gradient method to solve the Schatten norm
optimization problem. By tuning the parameter p in our proposed minimization,
we can simply trade-off the quality of the solution (i.e. the speed of
convergence) for communication/computation requirements (in terms of number of
messages exchanged and volume of data processed). Simulation results show that
our approach provides very good performance already for values of p that only
needs limited information exchange. The weight optimization iterative procedure
can also run in parallel with the consensus protocol and form a joint
consensus-optimization procedure.

represents a DNA sequence, and the spatial proximity between any two points
reflects the degree of structural similarity between the corresponding
sequences. The graphical representation of DNA sequences utilized, Chaos Game

genomic signature. Consequently, Molecular Distance Maps could inform species
identification, taxonomic classifications and, to a certain extent,
evolutionary history. The image distance employed, Structural Dissimilarity
Index (DSSIM), implicitly compares the occurrences of oligomers of length up to

via knowledge transfer between seen and unseen classes. This is typically
achieved by exploring a semantic embedding space where the seen and unseen

utilize the annotation-free semantic word space for the former and focus on
solving the latter issue of modeling relatedness. Specifically, in contrast to
previous work which ignores the semantic relationships between seen classes and
focus merely on those between seen and unseen classes, in this paper a novel
approach based on a semantic graph is proposed to represent the relationships
between all the seen and unseen class in a semantic word space. Based on this
semantic graph, we design a special absorbing Markov chain process, in which
each unseen class is viewed as an absorbing state. After incorporating one test
image into the semantic graph, the absorbing probabilities from the test data
to each unseen class can be effectively computed; and zero-shot classification
can be achieved by finding the class label with the highest absorbing
probability. The proposed model has a closed-form solution which is linear with
respect to the number of test images. We demonstrate the effectiveness and
computational efficiency of the proposed method over the state-of-the-arts on

are both expected to increase with decreasing metallicity. The sky-averaged
(global) 21-cm signal has the potential to test this prediction via constraints
on the thermal history of the intergalactic medium, since X-rays can most
easily escape galaxies and heat gas on large scales. A significant complication
in the interpretation of upcoming 21-cm measurements is the unknown spectrum of
accreting black holes at high-$z$, which depends on the mass of accreting
objects and poorly constrained processes such as how accretion disk photons are
processed by the disk atmosphere and host galaxy interstellar medium. Using a
novel approach to solving the cosmological radiative transfer equation (RTE),
we show that reasonable changes in the characteristic BH mass affects the
amplitude of the 21-cm signal's minimum at the $\sim 10-20$ mK level ---
comparable to errors induced by commonly used approximations to the RTE ---
while modifications to the intrinsic disk spectrum due to Compton scattering
(bound-free absorption) can shift the position of the minimum of the global
signal by $\Delta z \approx 0.5$ ($\Delta z \approx 2$), and modify its
amplitude by up to $\approx 10$ mK ($\approx 50$ mK) for a given accretion
history. Such deviations are larger than the uncertainties expected of current
global 21-cm signal extraction algorithms, and could easily be confused with
evolution in the $L_X$-SFR relation.

universe, according to the Everettian picture, is a closed system obeying only
unitary dynamics, and it therefore contains no distinguishable environmental
subsystems with the necessary phase randomness to effect einselection of a

environmental subsystems is the hidden premise that makes the derivation of
einselection circular. In effect, it presupposes the 'emergent' structures from

protoplanets. This is important for the planetary mass-radius relation since
k_gr affects the H/He envelope mass of low-mass planets and the critical core
mass of giant planets. Aims. The goal of this study is to derive an analytical
model for k_gr. Methods. Our model is based on the comparison of the timescales
of microphysical processes like grain settling in the Stokes and Epstein
regime, growth by Brownian motion coagulation and differential settling, grain
evaporation, and grain advection due to envelope contraction. With these
timescales we derive the grain size, abundance, and opacity. Results. We find
that the main growth process is differential settling. In this regime, k_gr has
a simple functional form and is given as 27 Q/8 H rho in the Epstein regime and
as 2 Q/H rho for Stokes drag. Grain dynamics lead to a typical radial structure
of k_gr with high ISM-like values in the top layers but a strong decrease in
the deeper parts where the grain-free molecular opacities take over.
Conclusions. In agreement with earlier results we find that k_gr is typically
much lower than in the ISM. The equations also show that a higher dust input in
the top layer does not strongly increase k_gr with two important implications.
First, for a formation of giant planet cores via pebbles, there could be the
issue that pebbles increase the grain input high in the atmosphere due to
ablation. This could potentially increase k_gr hindering giant planet
formation. Our study shows that this adverse effect should not occur. Second,
it means that a higher stellar [Fe/H] which presumably leads to a higher
surface density of planetesimals only favors giant planet formation without
being detrimental to it due to an increased k_gr. This corroborates the result
that core accretion explains the increase of the giant planet frequency with
[Fe/H].

strategies that could be utilized with high cadence surveys that should either

baryons contribute even less strongly to the local radial force and to the

log(r)~(0.46+-0.04)log(L_5100), reinforcing the picture of an approximately
constant ionization parameter for the ionized clouds across the ENLR. Besides
the ENLR, we also find gas ionized by young massive stars in more than 50 per
cent of the galaxies on kpc scales. In more than half of the sample, the
specific star formation rates based on the extinction-corrected Ha luminosity
are consistent with those of inactive disc-dominated galaxies, even for some
bulge-dominated QSO hosts. Enhanced SFRs of up to 70Msun/yr are rare and always
associated with signatures of major mergers. Comparison with the SFR based on
the 60+100micron FIR luminosity suggests that the FIR luminosity is
systematically contaminated by AGN emission and Ha appears to be a more robust
and sensitive tracer for the star formation rate. Evidence for efficient AGN
feedback is scarce in our sample, but some of our QSO hosts lack signatures of
ongoing star formation leading to a reduced specific SFR with respect to the
main sequence of galaxies. Based on 12 QSOs where we can make measurements, we
find that on average bulge-dominated QSO host galaxies tend to fall below the
mass-metallicity relation compared to their disc-dominated counterparts. While
not yet statistically significant for our small sample, this may provide a
useful diagnostic for future large surveys if this metal dilution can be shown
to be linked to recent or ongoing galaxy interactions.

populations at high-redshift ($z\sim$1-2). While most high$-z$ surveys are
biased towards massive galaxies, we are able to select sources via their
emission lines that have very-faint continua. We investigate the star formation
rate (SFR)-stellar mass ($M_{\star}$) relation for about 1000 emission-line
galaxies identified over a wide redshift range of $0.3 \lesssim z \lesssim
2.3$. We use the H$_{\alpha}$ emission as an accurate SFR indicator and correct
the broadband photometry for the strong nebular contribution to derive accurate
stellar masses down to $M_{\star} \sim 10^{7} M_{\odot}$. We focus here on a
subsample of galaxies that show extremely strong emission lines (EELGs) with
rest-frame equivalent widths ranging from 200 to 1500 \AA. This population
consists of outliers to the normal SFR-$M_{\star}$ sequence with much higher
specific SFRs ($> 10$ Gyr$^{-1}$). While on-sequence galaxies follow a
continuous star formation process, EELGs are thought to be caught during an
extreme burst of star formation that can double their stellar mass in less than
$100$ Myr. The contribution of starbursts to the total star formation density
appears to be larger than what has been reported for more massive galaxies in
previous studies. In the complete mass range $8.2 <$ log($M_{\star}/M_{\odot}$)
$< 10$ and a SFR lower completeness limit of about 2 $M_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ (10
$M_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$) at $z\sim1$ ($z \sim 2$), we find that starbursts having
EW$_{rest}$(H$_{\alpha}$)$>$ 300, 200, and 100 A contribute up to $\sim13$, 18,
and 34 %, respectively, to the total SFR of emission-line selected sample at
$z\sim1-2$. The comparison with samples of massive galaxies shows an increase
in the contribution of starbursts towards lower masses.

partition function. First computing the Wilson loops in the $U(N_1) \times
U(N_2)$ lens space matrix model exactly, we perform an analytic continuation,
$N_2$ to $-N_2$, to obtain the Wilson loops in the ABJ theory that is given in
terms of a formal series and only valid in perturbation theory. Via a
Sommerfeld-Watson type transform, we provide a nonperturbative completion that
renders the formal series well-defined at all couplings. This is given by ${\rm
min}(N_1,N_2)$-dimensional integrals that generalize the ""mirror description""
of the partition function of the ABJM theory. Using our results, we find the
maps between the Wilson loops in the original and Seiberg dual theories and
prove the duality. In our approach we can explicitly see how the perturbative
and nonperturbative contributions to the Wilson loops are exchanged under the
duality. The duality maps are further supported by a heuristic yet very useful
argument based on the brane configuration as well as an alternative derivation
based on that of Kapustin and Willett.

new cosmological information, it is crucial to reliably predict their
observables. The Effective Field Theory of Large Scale Structures (EFTofLSS)
provides a manifestly convergent perturbative scheme to compute the clustering
of dark matter in the weakly nonlinear regime in an expansion in $k/k_{\rm
NL}$, where $k$ is the wavenumber of interest and $k_{\rm NL}$ is the
wavenumber associated to the nonlinear scale. It has been recently shown that
the EFTofLSS matches to $1\%$ level the dark matter power spectrum at redshift
zero up to $k\simeq 0.3 h\,$Mpc$^{-1}$ and $k\simeq 0.6 h\,$Mpc$^{-1}$ at one
and two loops respectively, using only one counterterm that is fit to data.
Similar results have been obtained for the momentum power spectrum at one loop.
This is a remarkable improvement with respect to former analytical techniques.
Here we study the prediction for the equal-time dark matter bispectrum at one
loop. We find that at this order it is sufficient to consider the same
counterterm that was measured in the power spectrum. Without any remaining free
parameter, and in a cosmology for which $k_{\rm NL}$ is smaller than in the
previously considered cases ($\sigma_8=0.9$), we find that the prediction from
the EFTofLSS agrees very well with $N$-body simulations up to $k\simeq 0.25
h\,$Mpc$^{-1}$, given the accuracy of the measurements, which is of order a few
percent at the highest $k$'s of interest. While the fit is very good on average
up to $k\simeq 0.25 h\,$Mpc$^{-1}$, the fit performs slightly worse on
equilateral configurations, in agreement with expectations that for a given
maximum $k$, equilateral triangles are the most nonlinear.

to following grain growth, the method accounts for mass deposition by
planetesimals and grain porosity. We illustrate this method by computation of a
simplified atmosphere structure model. In agreement with previous works, grain
coagulation is seen to be very efficient. The opacity drops to values much
below the often-used `ISM-opacities' ($\sim$$1\ \mathrm{cm^2\ g}^{-1}$) and the
atmosphere structure profiles for temperature and density resemble that of the
grain-free case. Deposition of planetesimals in the radiative part of the
atmosphere hardly influences this outcome as the added surface is quickly
coagulated away. We observe a modest dependence on the internal structure
(porosity), but show that filling factors cannot become too large because of
compression by gas drag.

steepens the density profile around stars, generating the power-law tail on

Furthermore, we find turbulent velocity profiles to flatten inside collapsing

enhancements of turbulent velocity on small scales, as verified by changes to
the velocity power spectra. Our results indicate that gas self-gravity

well modeled by a Sersic profile with index ~ 6 and half-light radius ~ 30 kpc.
Although the single Sersic model fits the profiles well, we argue that the
systematics in the sky background measurement and the coupling between the
model parameters make the comparison of the model parameters ambiguous. Direct
comparison of the BCG profiles, on the other hand, has revealed an inside-out
growth for these most massive galaxies: as the mass of a BCG increases, the
central mass density of the galaxy increases slowly ($\rho_{1kpc} \propto
M*^{0.39}$), while the slope of the outer profile grows continuously shallower
($\alpha \propto M*^{-2.5}$). Such a fashion of growth continues down to the
less massive early-type galaxies (ETGs), without apparent distinction between
BCGs and non-BCGs. For the very massive ETGs and BCGs, the slope of the
Kormendy relation starts to trace the slope of the surface brightness profiles
and becomes insensitive to subtle profile evolution. These results are
generally consistent with dry mergers being the major driver of the mass growth
for BCGs and massive ETGs. We also find strong correlations between the
richness of clusters and the properties of BCGs: the more massive the clusters
are, the more massive the BCGs ($M*_{bcg} \propto M_{clusters}^{0.6}$) and the
shallower their surface brightness profiles. After taking into account the bias
in the cluster samples, we find the masses of the BCGs have grown by at least a
factor of 1.5 from z=0.5 to z=0, in contrast to the previous findings of no
evolution. Such an evolution validates the expectation from the LCDM model.

Revision matching journal version",,"10.1093/mnras/stu2632",,"astro-ph.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We investigate the dependence of the mass function of dark-matter haloes on
their environment within the cosmic web of large-scale structure. A dependence
of the halo mass function on large-scale mean density is a standard element of
cosmological theory, allowing mass-dependent biasing to be understood via the
peak-background split. On the assumption of a Gaussian density field, this
analysis can be extended to ask how the mass function depends on the
geometrical environment: clusters, filaments, sheets and voids, as classified
via the tidal tensor (the Hessian matrix of the gravitational potential). In
linear theory, the problem can be solved exactly, and the result is
attractively simple: the conditional mass function has no explicit dependence
on the local tidal field, and is a function only of the local density on the
filtering scale used to define the tidal tensor. There is nevertheless a strong
implicit predicted dependence on geometrical environment, because the local
density couples statistically to the derivatives of the potential. We compute
the predictions of this model and study the limits of their validity by
comparing them to results deduced empirically from $N$-body simulations. We
have verified that, to a good approximation, the abundance of haloes in
different environments depends only on their densities, and not on their tidal
structure. In this sense we find relative differences between halo abundances
in different environments with the same density which are smaller than 13%.
Furthermore, for sufficiently large filtering scales, the agreement with the
theoretical prediction is good, although there are important deviations from
the Gaussian prediction at small, non-linear scales. We discuss how to obtain
improved predictions in this regime, using the 'effective-universe' approach.

azulene, two 1-alkylazulenes, and five bridged azulene-anthracenes in three
different solvents: 1,1,1-trichloro-1,2,2-trifluoroethane, acetonitrile, and
xenon. The solute molecule was vibrationally excited by the photo-excitation of
the auzlenyl group to the S1 state through the fast internal conversion, and
the rate of solvent thermalization due to the vibrational energy relaxation was
determined. The thermalization rates for 1-alkylazulenes and bridged
azulene-anthracenes were faster than that of azulene. Based on the results of
the thermalization rates of 1-alkylazulenes, we concluded that the acceleration
of the energy dissipation from the azulenyl group induced the faster energy
dissipation from the solute to the solvent. The vibrational normal mode
analysis suggests that the density of the vibrational modes and anharmonic
coupling between the vibrational modes induce the faster intramolecular energy
redistribution. In xenon, the solvent thermalization rates were close to the
energy dissipation rates of the solute molecule reported using transient
absorption spectroscopy. On the other hand, in the chlorofluorocarbon, the
ratio of the thermalization rate to the dissipation rate was a dependent of the
molecular species, and especially faster solvent thermalization rate of
9-(6-(azulen-1-yl)hexyl)anthracene was predicted. The vibrational
characteristics of this solvent are discussed in the relation to the
vibrational modes and structures of the bridged compounds.

challenging to models because of the increased complexity of the equation of

ionized dense gas. In particular, many models that assume relatively simple
models for the broadening of atomic levels and mostly ideal gas physics
overestimate the flux in the blue part of their spectra. A solution to this
problem that has met with some success is that additional opacity at short
wavelengths comes for the extreme broadening of the Lyman alpha line of atomic
H by collisions primarily with H2. For the purpose of validating this model
more rigorously, we acquired Hubble Space Telescope STIS spectra of 8 very cool
white dwarfs (5 DA and 3 DC stars). Combined with their known parallaxes,
BVRIJHK and Spitzer IRAC photometry, we analyze their entire spectral energy
distribution (from 0.24 to 9.3 micron) with a large grid of model atmospheres

signal. Extensive research has been devoted to this arena over the last several
decades, and as a result, today's denoisers can effectively remove large
amounts of additive white Gaussian noise. A compressed sensing (CS)
reconstruction algorithm seeks to recover a structured signal acquired using a
small number of randomized measurements. Typical CS reconstruction algorithms
can be cast as iteratively estimating a signal from a perturbed observation.
This paper answers a natural question: How can one effectively employ a generic
denoiser in a CS reconstruction algorithm? In response, we develop an extension
of the approximate message passing (AMP) framework, called Denoising-based AMP
(D-AMP), that can integrate a wide class of denoisers within its iterations. We
demonstrate that, when used with a high performance denoiser for natural
images, D-AMP offers state-of-the-art CS recovery performance while operating
tens of times faster than competing methods. We explain the exceptional
performance of D-AMP by analyzing some of its theoretical features. A key
element in D-AMP is the use of an appropriate Onsager correction term in its
iterations, which coerces the signal perturbation at each iteration to be very
close to the white Gaussian noise that denoisers are typically designed to
remove.

asymptotic incoherence, asymptotic sparsity and multilevel sampling, can be
utilised to better understand underlying phenomena in practical compressed
sensing and improve results in real-world applications. The contribution of the
paper is fourfold:
  First, it explains how the sampling strategy depends not only on the signal
sparsity but also on its structure, and shows how to design effective sampling
strategies utilising this.
  Second, it demonstrates that the optimal sampling strategy and the efficiency
of compressed sensing also depends on the resolution of the problem, and shows
how this phenomenon markedly affects compressed sensing results and how to
exploit it.
  Third, as the new framework also fits analog (infinite dimensional) models
that govern many inverse problems in practice, the paper describes how it can
be used to yield substantial improvements.
  Fourth, by using multilevel sampling, which exploits the structure of the
signal, the paper explains how one can outperform random Gaussian/Bernoulli
sampling even when the classical $l^1$ recovery algorithm is replaced by
modified algorithms which aim to exploit structure such as model based or
Bayesian compressed sensing or approximate message passaging. This final
observation raises the question whether universality is desirable even when
such matrices are applicable.
  Examples of practical applications investigated in this paper include
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), Electron Microscopy (EM), Compressive Imaging
(CI) and Fluorescence Microscopy (FM). For the latter, a new compressed sensing
approach is also presented.

close proximity to their host stars has shown that a substantial fraction of
such objects posses orbits that are inclined with respect to the spin axes of
their stars. Mounting evidence for the wide-spread nature of this phenomenon
has challenged the conventional notion that large-scale orbital transport
occurs during the early epochs of planet formation and is accomplished via
planet-disk interactions. However, recent work has shown that the excitation of
spin-orbit misalignment between protoplanetary nebulae and their host stars can
naturally arise from gravitational perturbations in multi-stellar systems as
well as magnetic disk-star coupling. In this work, we examine these processes
in tandem. We begin with a thorough exploration of the
gravitationally-facilitated acquisition of spin-orbit misalignment and
analytically show that the entire possible range of misalignments can be
trivially reproduced. Moreover, we demonstrate that the observable spin-orbit
misalignment only depends on the primordial disk-binary orbit inclination.
Subsequently, we augment our treatment by accounting for magnetic torques and
show that more exotic dynamical evolution is possible, provided favorable
conditions for magnetic tilting. Cumulatively, our results suggest that
observed spin-orbit misalignments are fully consistent with disk-driven
migration as a dominant mechanism for the origin of close-in planets.

hot-channel and associated prominence through analyzing a limb event on 2011

prominence initially. It then quickly expanded, resulting in a separation of
the top of the hot-channel from that of the prominence. Meanwhile, both of them
experienced an instantaneous morphology transformation from a $\Lambda$ shape
to a reversed-Y shape and the top of these two structures showed an exponential
increase in height. These features are a good indication for the occurrence of
the kink instability. Moreover, the onset of the kink instability is found to
coincide in time with the impulsive enhancement of the flare emission
underneath the hot-channel, suggesting that the ideal kink instability likely
also plays an important role in triggering the fast flare reconnection besides
initiating the impulsive acceleration of the hot-channel and distorting its
morphology. We conclude that the hot-channel is most likely the MFR system and
the prominence only corresponds to the cool materials that are collected in the
bottom of the helical field lines of the MFR against the gravity.

  with Fewer Independent Kernels",,,,,"q-bio.QM cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In sparse coding it is common to tile an image into nonoverlapping patches,
and then use a dictionary to create a sparse representation of each tile
independently. In this situation, the overcompleteness of the dictionary is the
number of dictionary elements divided by the patch size. In deconvolutional
neural networks (DCNs), dictionaries learned on nonoverlapping tiles are
replaced by a family of convolution kernels. Hence adjacent points in the
feature maps (V1 layers) have receptive fields in the image that are
translations of each other. The translational distance is determined by the
dimensions of V1 in comparison to the dimensions of the image space. We refer
to this translational distance as the stride.
  We implement a type of DCN using a modified Locally Competitive Algorithm
(LCA) to investigate the relationship between the number of kernels, the
stride, the receptive field size, and the quality of reconstruction. We find,
for example, that for 16x16-pixel receptive fields, using eight kernels and a
stride of 2 leads to sparse reconstructions of comparable quality as using 512
kernels and a stride of 16 (the nonoverlapping case). We also find that for a
given stride and number of kernels, the patch size does not significantly
affect reconstruction quality. Instead, the learned convolution kernels have a
natural support radius independent of the patch size.

carbon-rich cores. As these hybrid WDs can be as massive as 1.30 $M_{\odot}$,
not much mass needs to be accreted for these objects to reach the Chandrasekhar

contribution to the overall SN Ia birth rate and found that such SNe Ia tend to
be relatively young with typical time delays between 0.1 and 1 Gyr, where some
may be as young as 30 Myr. SNe Ia from hybrid CONe WDs may contribute several
percent to all SNe Ia, depending on the common-envelope ejection efficiency and

intergalactic medium and the near-infrared (NIR) background light from the
high-redshift galaxies promises to be a powerful probe of cosmic reionization.
In this paper, we investigate the cross power spectrum during the epoch of
reionization. We employ an improved halo approach to derive the distribution of
the density field and consider two stellar populations in the star formation
model: metal-free stars and metal-poor stars. The reionization history is
further generated to be consistent with the electron-scattering optical depth
from cosmic microwave background measurements. Then the intensity of NIR
background is estimated by collecting emission from stars in the first-light
galaxies. On large scales, we find the 21 cm and NIR radiation backgrounds are
positively correlated during the very early stages of reionization. However,
these two radiation backgrounds quickly become anti-correlated as reionization
proceeds. The maximum absolute value of the cross power spectrum is
$|\Delta^2_{\rm{21,NIR}}|\sim10^{-4}$ mK nW $\rm{m}^{-2}$ $\rm{sr}^{-1}$
reached at $\ell\sim1000$, when the mean fraction of ionized hydrogen is
$\bar{x}_{i}\sim0.9$. We find that SKA can measure the 21 cm-NIR cross power
spectrum in conjunction with mild extensions to the existing CIBER survey,
provided that the integration time independently adds up to 1000 and 1 hours
for 21 cm and NIR observations, and that the sky coverage fraction of CIBER
survey is extended from $4\times10^{-4}$ to 0.1. Measuring the
cross-correlation signal as a function of redshift provides valuable
information on reionization and helps confirm the origin of the ""missing"" NIR
background.

various person images. In this paper, we propose an effective feature
representation called Local Maximal Occurrence (LOMO), and a subspace and
metric learning method called Cross-view Quadratic Discriminant Analysis
(XQDA). The LOMO feature analyzes the horizontal occurrence of local features,
and maximizes the occurrence to make a stable representation against viewpoint
changes. Besides, to handle illumination variations, we apply the Retinex
transform and a scale invariant texture operator. To learn a discriminant
metric, we propose to learn a discriminant low dimensional subspace by
cross-view quadratic discriminant analysis, and simultaneously, a QDA metric is
learned on the derived subspace. We also present a practical computation method

axioms. We call it a duality index. This paper extends the definition of
duality index to all outcomes including all gambles, and considers a portfolio
selection problem in a complete market, in which the agent's target is to
minimize the index of the utility of the relative investment outcome. By
linking this problem to a series of Merton's optimum consumption-like problems,
the optimal solution is explicitly derived. It is shown that if the prior
benchmark level is too high (which can be verified), then the investment risk
will be beyond any agent's risk tolerance. If the benchmark level is
reasonable, then the optimal solution will be the same as that of one of the
Merton's series problems, but with a particular value of absolute risk
aversion, which is given by an explicit algebraic equation as a part of the
optimal solution. According to our result, it is riskier to achieve the same
surplus profit in a stable market than in a less-stable market, which is
consistent with the common financial intuition.

interior $M$. Consider an affine connection $\nabla$ on $M$ for which the
boundary is at infinity. Then $\nabla$ is projectively compact of order
$\alpha$ if the projective structure defined by $\nabla$ smoothly extends to
all of $\overline{M}$ in a specific way that depends on no particular choice of
boundary defining function. Via the Levi--Civita connection, this concept
applies to pseudo--Riemannian metrics on $M$. We study the relation between
interior geometry and the possibilities for compactification, and then develop
the tools that describe the induced geometry on the boundary.
  We prove that a pseudo--Riemannian metric on $M$ which is projectively
compact of order two admits a certain asymptotic form. This form was known to
be sufficient for projective compactness, so the result establishes that it
provides an equivalent characterization.
  From a projectively compact connection on $M$, one obtains a projective
structure on $\overline{M}$, which induces a conformal class of (possibly
degenerate) bundle metrics on the tangent bundle to the hypersurface $\partial
M$. Using the asymptotic form, we prove that in the case of metrics, which are
projectively compact of order two, this boundary structure is always
non--degenerate. We also prove that in this case the metric is necessarily
asymptotically Einstein, in a natural sense.
  Finally, a non--degenerate boundary geometry gives rise to a (conformal)
standard tractor bundle endowed with a canonical linear connection, and we
explicitly describe these in terms of the projective data of the interior
geometry.

electrons by magnetic reconnection in the solar wind source region, using the
MHD and test particle simulations for both single X-line reconnection and
multiple X-line reconnection. We find that the direct current electric field,
produced in the magnetic reconnection region, can accelerate electrons from an
initial thermal energy of T $\sim10^5$ K up to hundreds of keV. After
acceleration, some of the accelerated electrons, together with the nascent
solar wind flow driven by the reconnection, propagate upwards along the
newly-opened magnetic field lines into the interplanetary space, while the rest
move downwards into the lower atmosphere. Similar to the observed superhalo
electrons at 1 AU, the flux of the upward-traveling accelerated electrons
versus energy displays a power-law distribution at $\sim$ 2 $-$ 100 keV, $f(E)
\sim E^{-\delta}$, with a $\delta$ of $\sim$ 1.5 $-$ 2.4. For single (multiple)
X-line reconnection, the spectrum becomes harder (softer) as the anomalous
resistivity parameter $\alpha$ (uniform resistivity $\eta$) increases. These
modeling results suggest that the acceleration in the solar wind source region
may contribute to superhalo electrons.

to rapid changes in the optical path difference of an interferometer, which
causes correlated flux losses. This leads to decreased sensitivity and accuracy
in the correlated flux measurement. Aims: To stabilize the N band
interferometric signal in MIDI (MID-infrared Interferometric instrument), we
use an external fringe tracker working in K band, the so-called FSU-A (fringe
sensor unit) of the PRIMA (Phase-Referenced Imaging and Micro-arcsecond
Astrometry) facility at VLTI. We present measurements obtained using the newly
commissioned and publicly offered MIDI+FSU-A mode. A first characterization of
the fringe-tracking performance and resulting gains in the N band are
presented. In addition, we demonstrate the possibility of using the FSU-A to
measure visibilities in the K band. Methods: We analyzed FSU-A fringe track
data of 43 individual observations covering different baselines and object K
band magnitudes with respect to the fringe-tracking performance. The N band
group delay and phase delay values could be predicted by computing the relative
change in the differential water vapor column density from FSU-A data.
Visibility measurements in the K band were carried out using a scanning mode of
the FSU-A. Results: Using the FSU-A K band group delay and phase delay
measurements, we were able to predict the corresponding N band values with high
accuracy with residuals of less than 1 micrometer. This allows the coherent
integration of the MIDI fringes of faint or resolved N band targets,
respectively. With that method we could decrease the detection limit of
correlated fluxes of MIDI down to 0.5 Jy (vs. 5 Jy without FSU-A) and 0.05 Jy
(vs. 0.2 Jy without FSU-A) using the ATs and UTs, respectively. The K band
visibilities could be measured with a precision down to ~2%.

reinforced as the only viable superglue in cuprate superconductors because
phonon-induced scattering is effectively nil for Cooper pairs (in its original

that (i) the Cooper-pair binding energy can be strengthened to obtain high

motors/generators, transformers, transmission lines and fault current limiters,
are usually operated in the alternate current (AC) regime. In order to be
efficient, the HTS devices need to have a sufficiently low value of AC loss, in
addition to the necessary current-carrying capacity. Most applications are
operated with currents beyond the current capacity of single conductors and
consequently require cabled conductor solutions with much higher current
carrying capacity, from a few kA to up to 20-30 kA for large hydro-generators.
A century ago, in 1914, Ludwig Roebel invented a low-loss cable design for
copper cables, which was successively named after him. The main idea behind
Roebel cables is to separate the current in different strands and to provide a
full transposition of the strands along the cable direction. Nowadays, these
cables are commonly used in the stator of large generators. Based on the same
design concept of their conventional material counterparts, HTS Roebel cables
from REBCO coated conductors were first manufactured at the Karlsruhe Institute
of Technology (KIT) and have been successively developed in a number of
varieties that provide all the required technical features such as fully
transposed strands, high transport currents and low AC losses, yet retaining
enough flexibility for a specific cable design. In the past few years a large
number of scientific papers have been published on the concept, manufacturing
and characterization of such cables. Times are therefore mature for a review of
those results. The goal is to provide an overview and a succinct and
easy-to-consult guide for users, developers, and manufacturers of this kind of
HTS cables.

reasoning about the quality of software and hardware systems. As opposed to
traditional verification, where one handles the question of whether a system
satisfies, or not, a given specification, reasoning about quality addresses the
question of \emph{how well} the system satisfies the specification. One
direction in this effort is to refine the ""eventually"" operators of temporal
logic to {\em discounting operators}: the satisfaction value of a specification
is a value in $[0,1]$, where the longer it takes to fulfill eventuality
requirements, the smaller the satisfaction value is.
  In this paper we introduce an augmentation by discounting of Linear Temporal
Logic (LTL), and study it, as well as its combination with propositional
quality operators. We show that one can augment LTL with an arbitrary set of
discounting functions, while preserving the decidability of the model-checking

operators preserves decidability, whereas adding an average-operator makes some
problems undecidable. We also discuss the complexity of the problem, as well as

the transmitter propagate in the environment and are absorbed by the receiver
through its receptors. When the receiver absorbs the desired quantity of

transmission. The proposed protocol implements a bidirectional communication by
using a number of techniques originally designed for the TCP. In fact, the
proposed protocol is connection-oriented, and uses the TCP-like probing to find
a suitable transmission rate between transmitter and receiver so as to avoid
receiver congestion. Unlike the TCP, however, explicit acknowledgments are not
used, since they would degrade the communication throughput due to the large

protocol uses implicit acknowledgments, and feedback signals are sent by the

addresses deterministic locomotion in quiescent environments. Thermal
fluctuations in fluids are known to lead to a Brownian loss of the swimming
direction. As most cells or synthetic swimmers are immersed in external flows,
we consider theoretically in this paper the stochastic dynamics of a model
active particle (a self-propelled sphere) in a steady general linear flow. The
stochasticity arises both from translational diffusion in physical space, and
from a combination of rotary diffusion and run-and-tumble dynamics in
orientation space. We begin by deriving a general formulation for all
components of the long-time mean square displacement tensor for a swimmer with
a time-dependent swimming velocity and whose orientation decorrelates due to
rotary diffusion alone. This general framework is applied to obtain the
convectively enhanced mean-squared displacements of a steadily-swimming
particle in three canonical linear flows (extension, simple shear, and
solid-body rotation). We then show how to extend our results to the case where
the swimmer orientation also decorrelates on account of run-and-tumble
dynamics. Self-propulsion in general leads to the same long-time temporal
scalings as for passive particles in linear flows but with increased
coefficients. In the particular case of solid-body rotation, the effective
long-time diffusion is the same as that in a quiescent fluid, and we clarify
the lack of flow-dependence by briefly examining the dynamics in elliptic
linear flows. By comparing the new active terms with those obtained for passive
particles we see that swimming can lead to an enhancement of the mean-square
displacements by orders of magnitude, and could be relevant for biological
organisms or synthetic swimming devices in fluctuating environmental or
biological flows.

of this information causes a serious privacy threat when documents are
uncontrollably made available to untrusted third parties. In such cases,
appropriate data protection measures should be undertaken by the responsible
organization, especially under the umbrella of current legislations on data
privacy. To do so, human experts are usually requested to redact or sanitize
document contents. To relieve this burdensome task, this paper presents a
privacy model for document redaction/sanitization, which offers several
advantages over other models available in the literature. Based on the
well-established foundations of data semantics and the information theory, our
model provides a framework to develop and implement automated and inherently

  Twitter",,,,,"cs.SI physics.soc-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Twitter is now an established and a widely popular news medium. Be it normal
banter or a discussion on high impact events like Boston marathon blasts,
February 2014 US Icestorm, etc., people use Twitter to get updates. Twitter
bots have today become very common and acceptable. People are using them to get
updates about emergencies like natural disasters, terrorist strikes, etc.
Twitter bots provide these users a means to perform certain tasks on Twitter
that are both simple and structurally repetitive. During high impact events
these Twitter bots tend to provide time critical and comprehensive information.
We present how bots participate in discussions and augment them during high
impact events. We identify bots in high impact events for 2013: Boston blasts,
February 2014 US Icestorm, Washington Navy Yard Shooting, Oklahoma tornado, and
Cyclone Phailin. We identify bots among top tweeters by getting all such
accounts manually annotated. We then study their activity and present many
important insights. We determine the impact bots have on information diffusion
during these events and how they tend to aggregate and broker information from
various sources to different users. We also analyzed their tweets, list down
important differentiating features between bots and non bots (normal or human
accounts) during high impact events. We also show how bots are slowly moving
away from traditional API based posts towards web automation platforms like
IFTTT, dlvr.it, etc. Using standard machine learning, we proposed a methodology
to identify bots/non bots in real time during high impact events. This study
also looks into how the bot scenario has changed by comparing data from high
impact events from 2013 with data from similar type of events from 2011.
Lastly, we also go through an in-depth analysis of Twitter bots who were active
during 2013 Boston Marathon Blast.

supercurrent mainly contributes to proliferation of the gapless phase. Our

played a fundamental role in the evolution of human societies. These good
actions may not maximise the actor's payoff, but they maximise the other's
payoff. Consequently, their existence is puzzling for evolutionary theories.
Why should you make an effort to help others, even when no reward seems to be
at stake? Indeed, experiments typically show that humans are heterogeneous:
some may help others, while others may not. With the aim of favouring the
emergence of 'successful cultures', a number of studies has recently
investigated what mechanisms promote the evolution of a particular good action.
But still little is known about if and how good actions can spread from person
to person. For instance, does being recipient of an altruistic act increase
your probability of being cooperative with others? Plato's quote, 'Good actions
give strength to ourselves and inspire good actions in others', suggests that
is possible. We have conducted an experiment on Amazon Mechanical Turk to test
this mechanism using economic games. We have measured willingness to be
cooperative through a standard Prisoner's dilemma and willingness to act
altruistically using a binary Dictator game. In the baseline treatments, the
endowments needed to play were given by the experimenters, as usual; in the
control treatments, they came from a good action made by someone else. Across
four different comparisons and a total of 572 subjects, we have never found a
significant increase of cooperation or altruism when the endowment came from a
good action. We conclude that good actions do not necessarily inspire good
actions in others, at least in the ideal scenario of a lab experiment with
anonymous subjects.

of modern photonics applications ranging from light harvesting, through novel
compact light sources, to quantum-information processing based on single
photons. Nanophotonic waveguides are particularly well suited for such
applications since they confine photon propagation to a 1D geometry thereby
increasing the interaction between light and matter. Adding chiral
functionalities to nanophotonic waveguides lead to new opportunities enabling
integrated and robust quantum-photonic devices or the observation of novel
topological photonic states. In a regular waveguide, a quantum emitter radiates
photons in either of two directions, and photon emission and absorption are
reverse processes. This symmetry is violated in nanophotonic structures where a
non-transversal local electric field implies that both photon emission and
scattering may become directional. Here we experimentally demonstrate that the
internal state of a quantum emitter determines the chirality of single-photon
emission in a specially engineered photonic-crystal waveguide. Single-photon
emission into the waveguide with a directionality of more than 90\% is observed
under conditions where practically all emitted photons are coupled to the
waveguide. Such deterministic and highly directional photon emission enables
on-chip optical diodes, circulators operating at the single-photon level, and
deterministic quantum gates. Based on our experimental demonstration, we
propose an experimentally achievable and fully scalable deterministic
photon-photon CNOT gate, which so far has been missing in photonic
quantum-information processing where most gates are probabilistic.

$\mathbb{F}$ if $X$ is connected and, for every induced subcomplex $Y$ of $X$,
the linear map $H_\ast (Y; \mathbb{F}) \rightarrow H_\ast (X; \mathbb{F})$
(induced by the inclusion map) is injective. This notion was introduced by
K\""{u}hnel in [10]. In this paper we prove the following two combinatorial
criteria for tightness. (a) Any $(k+1)$-neighbourly $k$-stacked
$\mathbb{F}$-homology manifold with boundary is $\mathbb{F}$-tight. Also, (b)
any $\mathbb{F}$-orientable $(k+1)$-neighbourly $k$-stacked
$\mathbb{F}$-homology manifold without boundary is $\mathbb{F}$-tight, at least
if its dimension is not equal to $2k+1$.
  The result (a) appears to be the first criterion to be found for tightness of
(homology) manifolds with boundary. Since every $(k+1)$-neighbourly $k$-stacked
manifold without boundary is, by definition, the boundary of a
$(k+1)$-neighbourly $k$-stacked manifold with boundary - and since we now know
several examples (including two infinite families) of triangulations from the
former class - theorem (a) provides us with many examples of tight triangulated
manifolds with boundary.
  The second result (b) generalizes a similar result from [2] which was proved
for a class of combinatorial manifolds without boundary. We believe that
theorem (b) is valid for dimension $2k+1$ as well. Except for this lacuna, this
result answers a recent question of Effenberger [8] affirmatively.

takes a quantitative form when applied to the visibility $\mathcal V$ and

the inequality $\mathcal V^2+ \mathcal P^2 \leq 1$. However, if such a system
is coupled to its environment, it becomes possible to obtain conditional
measures of visibility and predictability, i.e.~measures that are conditional
on the state of the environment. We show that in this case, the predictability
and visibility values can lead to an apparent violation of the duality
principle. We experimentally realize this apparent violation in a controlled
manner by enforcing a fair-sampling-like loophole via postselection. Given the
ability to simultaneously obtain high predictability information and high
visibility interference fringes for a wide range of coupling strengths and
postselected states, this work highlights the role of fair-sampling in tests of

study an accelerated observer in Minkowski space as a quantum tunnelling
problem in Rindler space. Both Bosonic and Fermionic modes are calculated to
construct a reduced density matrix of particles tunnelling out across the
accelerated Rindler horizon, giving a thermal spectrum characterized by a
temperature proportional to the local acceleration - Unruh temperature. So, we
calculate both the spectrum and temperature from within the tunnelling
framework.
  In another direction, following Utiyama-Sciama-Kibble, we localise the
Poincare group to obtain a Poincare gauge theory (PGT) of gravity. It had been
pointed before in the literature, that the Poincare symmetries seemed to be
recoverable canonically only on-shell. This would however mean existence of two
independent sets of symmetries, each by itself having number of gauge
parameters equal to the Poincare group, implying an apparent doubling of
symmetries. To resolve this, we first start by a constraint analysis and
construct the first-class gauge generator through an explicitly off-shell
algorithm. We investigate both the Mielke-Baekler 3d model and a PGT
formulation of New-Massive gravity. Next, we carefully study the symmetries and
corresponding Noether identities to show that the difference between the two
sets is a `trivial symmetry.' These is a transformation of fields that is not a
true gauge symmetry as it gives rise to no new gauge degeneracy in defining
physical states.

an (outer) Runge-Kutta method of arbitrary order. We show that, with an
appropriate choice of inner step size, the time step restriction on the outer
time step is similar to the CFL condition for the hyperbolic conservation law.
Moreover, the number of inner time steps is also independent of the stiffness
of the BGK source term. We discuss stability and consistency, and illustrate
with numerical results (linear advection, Burgers' equation and the shallow
water and Euler equations) in one and two spatial dimensions.

on a previously established framework. There are three functional modules in
this framework, namely, a transient well flow model that describes the response
of certain physical variables in a well, for instance, temperature, velocity
and pressure, to the flow rates entering and leaving the well zones; a Markov
jump process that is designed to capture the potential abrupt changes in the
flow rates; and an estimation method that is adopted to estimate the underlying
flow rates based on the measurements from the physical sensors installed in the
well.
  In the previous studies, the variances of the flow rates in the Markov jump
process are chosen manually. To fill this gap, in the current work two
automatic approaches are proposed in order to optimize the variance estimation.
Through a numerical example, we show that, when the estimation framework is
used in conjunction with these two proposed variance-estimation approaches, it
can achieve reasonable performance in terms of matching both the measurements
of the physical sensors and the true underlying flow rates.

assimilation problems. In certain circumstances, however, divergence of the
EnKF might be spotted. In previous studies, the authors proposed an
observation-space-based strategy, called residual nudging, to improve the
stability of the EnKF when dealing with linear observation operators. The main
idea behind residual nudging is to monitor and, if necessary, adjust the
distances (misfits) between the real observations and the simulated ones of the
state estimates, in the hope that by doing so one may be able to obtain better
estimation accuracy.
  In the present study, residual nudging is extended and modified in order to
handle nonlinear observation operators. Such extension and modification result
in an iterative filtering framework that, under suitable conditions, is able to
achieve the objective of residual nudging for data assimilation problems with
nonlinear observation operators. The 40 dimensional Lorenz 96 model is used to
illustrate the performance of the iterative filter. Numerical results show
that, while a normal EnKF may diverge with nonlinear observation operators, the
proposed iterative filter remains stable and leads to reasonable estimation
accuracy under various experimental settings.

such important properties of real-world networks as the power-law degree
distribution, small diameter, etc. Many different models are based on the idea
of preferential attachment: LCD, Buckley-Osthus, Holme-Kim, fitness, random
Apollonian network, and many others.
  Although preferential attachment models reflect some important properties of
real-world networks, they do not allow to model the so-called recency property.
Recency property reflects the fact that in many real networks vertices tend to
connect to other vertices of similar age. This fact motivated us to introduce a
new class of models - recency-based models. This class is a generalization of
fitness models, which were suggested by Bianconi and Barabasi. Bianconi and
Barabasi extended preferential attachment models with pages' inherent quality
or fitness of vertices. When a new vertex is added to the graph, it is joined
to some already existing vertices that are chosen with probabilities
proportional to the product of their fitness and incoming degree.
  We generalize fitness models by adding a recency factor to the attractiveness
function. This means that pages are gaining incoming links according to their
attractiveness, which is determined by the incoming degree of the page (current
popularity), its inherent quality (some page-specific constant) and age (new
pages are gaining new links more rapidly).
  We analyze different properties of recency-based models. In particular, we
show that some distributions of inherent quality lead to the power-law degree
distribution.

central star of the candidate planetary nebula IPHASXJ211420.0+434136 (also
named Ou5) was clearly variable. This is generally considered as an indication
of binarity. To confirm it, we performed a photometric monitoring of the
central star, and obtained images and spectra of the nebula.
  The nebular spectrum confirms that IPHASXJ211420.0+434136 is a planetary
nebula of moderately high excitation. It has a remarkable morphology with two
nested pairs of bipolar lobes, and other unusual features. The light curve of
the central star reveals that it is an eclipsing binary system with an orbital
period of 8.74 hours. It also displays a strong irradiation effect with an
amplitude of 1.5~mag.
  The presence of multiple bipolar outflows adds constraints to the formation
of these nebulae, suggesting the occurrence of discrete ejection events during,
or immediately before, the common-envelope phase.
  IPHASXJ211420.0+434136 also adds evidence to the hypothesis that a
significant fraction of planetary nebulae with close binary central stars have
a peculiar nebular chemistry and a relatively low nebular mass. This may point
to low-mass, low-metallicity progenitors, with additional effects related to
the binary evolution. We also suggest that these objects may be relevant to
understand the abundance discrepancy problem in planetary nebulae.

results of the coupled cluster method and the exact diagonalization method both
disclose that the type of phase transition occurring at ac1 changes from a

financial puzzle to explain, since assuming foreign exchange risk is
uninhibited and the markets have rational risk-neutral investors, then one
would not expect profits from such strategies. That is, according to uncovered
interest rate parity (UIP), changes in the related exchange rates should offset
the potential to profit from such interest rate differentials. However, it has
been shown empirically, that investors can earn profits on average by borrowing
in a country with a lower interest rate, exchanging for foreign currency, and
investing in a foreign country with a higher interest rate, whilst allowing for
any losses from exchanging back to their domestic currency at maturity. This
paper explores the financial risk that trading strategies seeking to exploit a
violation of the UIP condition are exposed to with respect to multivariate tail
dependence present in both the funding and investment currency baskets. It will
outline in what contexts these portfolio risk exposures will benefit
accumulated portfolio returns and under what conditions such tail exposures
will reduce portfolio returns.

that the enhancement factors scale with the orbital ionization energy $I_{nl}$

improve his result. We are especially interested in the cases that the phase is
smooth and that the amplitude has a zero at a critical point of the phase. In
order to exactly treat the latter case, a weight function is introduced in the

oscillatory integrals, whose phases and weights are contained in a certain
class of smooth functions including the real analytic class, can be expressed
by the Newton distance and multiplicity defined in terms of geometrical
relationship of the Newton polyhedra of the phase and the weight. We also
compute explicit formulae of the coefficient of the leading term of the
asymptotic expansion in the weighted case. Our method is based on the
resolution of singularities constructed by using the theory of toric varieties,
which naturally extends the resolution of Varchenko. The properties of poles of
local zeta functions, which are closely related to the behavior of oscillatory

inorganic chemical reactions. The computational study of their electronic
structure is often challenging, because a reliable description of the
correlation, and in particular of the static one, requires multi-reference
techniques. The Jastrow correlated Antisymmetrized Geminal Power (JAGP) is a
compact and efficient wave function ansatz, based on the valence-bond
representation, which can be used within Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) approaches.
The AGP part can be rewritten in terms of molecular orbitals, obtaining a
multi-determinant expansion with zero-seniority number. In the present work we
demonstrate the capability of the JAGP ansatz to correctly describe the
electronic structure of two diradical prototypes: the orthogonally twisted
ethylene, C2H4, and the methylene, CH2, representing respectively a
homosymmetric and heterosymmetric system. On the other hand, we show that the
simple ansatz of a Jastrow correlated Single Determinant (JSD) wave function is
unable to provide an accurate description of the electronic structure in these
diradical molecules, both at variational level and, more remarkably, in the
fixed-nodes projection schemes showing that a poor description of the static
correlation yields an inaccurate nodal surface. The suitability of JAGP to
correctly describe diradicals with a computational cost comparable with that of
a JSD calculation, in combination with a favorable scalability of QMC
algorithms with the system size, opens new perspectives in the ab initio study
of large diradical systems, like the transition states in cycloaddition

indicate that the indexing ratio is low in Google, and virtually nonexistent in

Usually, Monte Carlo ophthalmic brachytherapy dosimetry is performed in a water
phantom. However, here, the compositions of human eye have been considered
instead of water. Both human eye and water phantoms have been simulated with
MCNP5 code. These simulations were performed for a fully-loaded 16 mm COMS eye
plaque containing 13 125I seeds. The dose delivered to the tumor and healthy
tissues have been calculated in both phantoms, with and without GNPs. The
results indicates that the dose to the tumor in an eye-ball implanted with COMS
plaque increases with increasing GNPs concentration inside the target.
Therefore, the required irradiation time for the tumors in the eye is decreased
by adding the GNPs prior to treatment. As a result, the dose to healthy tissues
decreases when the irradiation time is reduced. Furthermore, a comparison
between the simulated data in an eye phantom made of water and eye phantom made
of human-eye composition, in the presence of GNPs shows the significance of
utilizing the composition of eye in ophthalmic brachytherapy dosimetry.
Normally, the radiation therapy of cancer patients is designed to deliver a
required dose to the tumor while sparing the surrounding healthy tissues. The
results demonstrated that the use of GNPs enable us to overcome this challenge.
Also, defining the eye composition instead of water will leads to more accurate
calculations of GNPs radiation effects in ophthalmic brachytherapy dosimetry.

map considered for the present study is the Arnold-Beltrami-Childress (ABC)
map. We consider the behavior of the system both in the aerosol regime, where
the density of the particle is larger than that of the base flow, as well as
the bubble regime, where the particle density is less than that of the base
flow. The phase spaces in both the regimes show rich and complex dynamics with
three type of dynamical behaviors - chaotic structures, regular orbits and
hyperchaotic regions. In the one-action case, the aerosol regime is found to
have periodic attractors for certain values of the dissipation and inertia
parameters. For the aerosol regime of the two-action ABC map, an attractor
merging and widening crises is identified using the bifurcation diagram and the
spectrum of Lyapunov exponents. After the crisis an attractor with two parts is
seen, and trajectories hop between these parts with period 2. The bubble regime
of the embedded map shows strong hyperchaotic regions as well as crisis induced
intermittency with characteristic times between bursts that scale as a power
law behavior as a function of the dissipation parameter. Furthermore, we
observe riddled basin of attraction and unstable dimension variability in the
phase space in the bubble regime. The bubble regime in one-action shows similar
behavior. This study of a simple model of impurity dynamics may shed light upon
the transport properties of passive scalars in three dimensional flows. We also
compare our results with those seen earlier in two dimensional flows.

resolve the thermodynamic structure of the Intracluster Medium (ICM) on length
scales of ~ 1 kpc near the cool core. We find several previously unresolved
structures, including a high pressure feature to the north of the BCG that
appears to arise from the bulk motion of Abell 1795's cool core. To the south
of the cool core, we find low temperature (~ 3 keV), diffuse ICM gas extending
for distances of ~ 50 kpc spatially coincident with previously identified
filaments of H-alpha emission. Gas at similar temperatures is also detected in
adjacent regions without any H-alpha emission. The X-ray gas coincident with
the H-alpha filament has been measured to be cooling spectroscopically at a
rate of ~ 1 Solar Masses/ yr, consistent with measurements of the star
formation rate in this region as inferred from UV observations, suggesting that
the star formation in this filament as inferred by its H$\alpha$ and UV
emission can trace its origin to the rapid cooling of dense, X-ray emitting
gas. The H-alpha filament is not a unique site of cooler ICM, however, as ICM
at similar temperatures and even higher metallicities not cospatial with
H$\alpha$ emission is observed just to the west of the H-alpha filament,
suggesting that it may have been uplifted by Abell 1795's central active
galaxy. Further simulations of cool core sloshing and AGN feedback operating in
concert with one another will be necessary to understand how such a dynamic
cool core region may have originated and why the H-alpha emission is so
localized with respect to the cool X-ray gas despite the evidence for a
catastrophic cooling flow.

case which is apparently more problematic than those I treated before:
renormalization.
  Renormalization is a vast subject. So I confine myself to emphasizing how the
modern approach to renormalization (initiated by Wilson and others between 1965
and 1975), when applied to quantum field theories, illustrates both Nagelian
reduction and emergence. My main point is that the modern understanding of how
renormalizability is a generic feature of quantum field theories at accessible
energies gives us a conceptually unified family of Nagelian reductions.
  That is worth saying since philosophers tend to think of scientific
explanation as only explaining an individual event, or perhaps a single law, or
at most deducing one theory as a special case of another. Here we see a
framework in which there is a space of theories endowed with enough structure
that it provides a family of reductions.

galaxies and is visually the most striking feature in cosmological maps.
  Aims. We study the distribution of galaxies along the filamentary network,
trying to find specific patterns and regularities.
  Methods. Galaxy filaments are defined by the Bisous model, a marked point
process with interactions. We use the two-point correlation function and the
Rayleigh Z-squared statistic to study how galaxies and galaxy groups are
distributed along the filaments.
  Results. We show that galaxies and groups are not uniformly distributed along
filaments, but tend to form a regular pattern. The characteristic length of the
pattern is around 7 Mpc/h. A slightly smaller characteristic length 4 Mpc/h can
also be found, using the Z-squared statistic.
  Conclusions. We find that galaxy filaments in the Universe are like pearl
necklaces, where the pearls are galaxy groups distributed more or less
regularly along the filaments. We propose that this well defined characteristic
scale could be used to test various cosmological models and to probe
environmental effects on the formation and evolution of galaxies.

a porous medium. The coupling of evapotranspiration remains a key aspect
affecting overall root behavior. Predicting the evapotranspiration curve in the
presence of roots helps keep track of the amount of water that remains in the
porous medium. Using a controlled visual set-up of a 2D model soil system
consisting of monodisperse glass beads, we first perform experiments on actual
roots grown in partially saturated systems under different relative humidity
conditions. We record parameters such as the total mass loss in the medium and
the resulting position of the receding fronts and use these experimental
results to develop a simple analytical model that predicts the position of the
evaporating front as a function of time as well as the total amount of water
that is lost from the medium due to the combined effects of evaporation and
transpiration. The model is based on fundamental principles of evaporation flux
and includes empirical assumptions on the quantity of stoma in the leaves and
the transition time between regime 1 and regime 2. The model also underscores
the importance of a much prolonged root life as long as the root is exposed to
a partially saturated zone composed of a mixture of air and water. Comparison
between the model and experimental results shows good prediction of the
position of the evaporating front as well as the total mass loss from
evapotranspiration in the presence of real root systems. These results provide
additional understanding of both complex evaporation phenomenon and its
influence on root mechanisms.

spatially nonlocal nonlinear optical interactions. We show that in properly

internal down-conversion between a single quantized plasmon and an entangled
plasmon pair, or the reverse process of second harmonic generation. A separate
issue is how such strong internal nonlinearities can be observed, given the
nominally weak coupling between these plasmon resonances and free-space
radiative fields. On one hand, by using the collective coupling to radiation of
nanostructure arrays, we show that the internal nonlinearities can manifest
themselves as efficient frequency conversion of radiative fields at extremely
low input powers. On the other hand, the development of techniques to
efficiently couple to single nanostructures would allow these nonlinear
processes to occur at the level of single input photons.

play a crucial role in the evolution of these systems. The supernova explosions
that mark the death of massive stars in these regions often lead to
interactions between the supernova remnants (SNRs) and the clouds. These
interactions have a profound effect on our understanding of SNRs. Shocks in
SNRs should be capable of accelerating particles to cosmic ray (CR) energies
with efficiencies high enough to power Galactic CRs. X-ray and gamma-ray
studies have established the presence of relativistic electrons and protons is
some SNRs and provided strong evidence for diffusive shock acceleration as the
primary acceleration mechanism, including strongly amplified magnetic fields,
temperature and ionization effects on the shock-heated plasmas, and
modifications to the dynamical evolution of some systems. Because protons
dominate the overall energetics of the CRs, it is crucial to understand this
hadronic component even though electrons are much more efficient radiators and
it can be difficult to identify the hadronic component. However, near MCs the
densities are sufficiently high to allow the gamma-ray emission to be dominated
by protons. Thus, these interaction sites provide some of our best
opportunities to constrain the overall energetics of these particle
accelerators. Here we summarize some key properties of interactions between
SNRs and MCs, with an emphasis on recent X-ray and gamma-ray studies that are

intercombination line and provide theoretical models to describe the obtained
bound state energies. We show that using only the molecular states correlating
with the $^1S_0$$+$$^3P_1$ asymptote is insufficient to provide a mass scaled
theoretical model that would reproduce the bound state energies for all
isotopes investigated to date: $^{84}$Sr, $^{86}$Sr and $^{88}$Sr. We attribute
that to the recently discovered avoided crossing between the $^1S_0$$+$$^3P_1$
$0_u^+$ ($^3\Pi_u$) and $^1S_0$$+$$^1D_2$ $0_u^+$ ($^1\Sigma^+_u$) potential
curves at short range and we build a mass scaled interaction model that
quantitatively reproduces the available $0_u^+$ and $1_u$ bound state energies
for the three stable bosonic isotopes. We also provide isotope-specific
two-channel models that incorporate the rotational (Coriolis) mixing between
the $0_u^+$ and $1_u$ curves which, while not mass scaled, are capable of
quantitatively describing the vibrational splittings observed in experiment. We
find that the use of state-of-the-art ab initio potential curves significantly
improves the quantitative description of the Coriolis mixing between the two -8
GHz bound states in $^{88}$Sr over the previously used model potentials. We
show that one of the recently reported energy levels in $^{84}$Sr does not
follow the long range bound state series and theorize on the possible causes.
Finally, we give the Coriolis mixing angles and linear Zeeman coefficients for
all of the photoassociation lines. The long range van der Waals coefficients
$C_6(0_u^+)=3868(50)$~a.u. and $C_6(1_u)=4085(50)$~a.u. are reported.

surface, called the heliopause (HP), that separates the plasma and magnetic

that in August 2012 Voyager 1 (V1) crossed that boundary. Unexpectedly, the
magnetic fields on both its sides, although theoretically independent of each
other, were found to be similar in direction. This delayed the identification
of the boundary as the heliopause and led to many alternative explanations.
Here we show that the Voyager 1 observations can be readily explained and,
after the Interstellar Boundary Explorer (IBEX) discovery of the ribbon, could
even have been predicted. Our explanation relies on the fact that the Voyager 1
and the undisturbed interstellar field directions (which we assume to be given
by the IBEX ribbon center (RC)) share the same heliolatitude (~34.5 degrees)
and are not far separated in longitude (difference ~27 degrees). Our result
confirms that Voyager 1 has indeed crossed the heliopause and offers the first
independent confirmation that the IBEX ribbon center is in fact the direction
of the undisturbed interstellar magnetic field. For Voyager 2 we predict that
the difference between the inner and the outer magnetic field directions at the
heliopause will be significantly larger than the one observed by Voyager 1 (~30
degrees, instead of ~20 degrees), and that the outer field direction will be
close to the RC.

  FASTQ is a standard file format for DNA sequencing data which stores both
nucleotides and quality scores. A typical sequencing study can easily generate
hundreds of gigabytes of FASTQ files, while public archives such as ENA and
NCBI and large international collaborations such as the Cancer Genome Atlas can
accumulate many terabytes of data in this format. Text compression tools such
as gzip are often employed to reduce the storage burden, but have the
disadvantage that the data must be decompressed before it can be used.
  Here we present BEETL-fastq, a tool that not only compresses FASTQ-formatted
DNA reads more compactly than gzip, but also permits rapid search for $k$-mer
queries within the archived sequences. Importantly, the full FASTQ record of
each matching read or read pair is returned, allowing the search results to be
piped directly to any of the many standard tools that accept FASTQ data as
input.
  Results:
  We show that 6.6 terabytes of human reads in FASTQ format can be transformed
into 1.7 terabytes of indexed files, from where we can search for 1, 10, 100,
1000, a million of 30-mers in respectively 3, 8, 14, 45 and 567 seconds plus 20
ms per output read. Useful applications of the search capability are
highlighted, including the genotyping of structural variant breakpoints and ""in
silico pull-down"" experiments in which only the reads that cover a region of
interest are selectively extracted for the purposes of variant calling or
visualization.

Universe. Recently Chon et al.(2013) presented the first supercluster catalogue
constructed with a well-defined selection function based on the X-ray
flux-limited cluster survey, REFLEX II. For the construction of the sample we
proposed a concept to find the large objects with a minimum overdensity such
that most of their mass will collapse in the future. The main goal of the paper
is to provide support for our concept using simulations that we can, on the
basis of our observational sample of X-ray clusters, construct a supercluster
sample defined by a certain minimum overdensity, and to test how superclusters
trace the underlying dark matter distribution. Our results confirm that an
overdensity in the number of clusters is tightly correlated with an overdensity
of the dark matter distribution. This enables us to define superclusters such
that most of the mass will collapse in the future and to get first-order mass
estimates of superclusters on the basis of the properties of the member
clusters. We also show that in this context the ratio of the cluster number
density and dark matter mass density is consistent with the theoretically
expected cluster bias. Our previous work provided evidence that superclusters
are a special environment for density structures of the dark matter to grow
differently from the field as characterised by the X-ray luminosity function.
Here we confirm for the first time that this originates from a top-heavy mass
function at high statistical significance provided by a Kolmogorov-Smirnov
test. We also find in close agreement with observations that the superclusters
occupy only a small volume of few percent while they contain more than half of
the clusters in the present day Universe.

antiferroelectric-ferroelectric polar phase reaching the ferroelectric onset at

number of phonons is maintained down to 4 K. A weak phonon anomaly in the band
profile at 217 cm-1 (4 K) suggests subtle Rare Earth magnetoelectric couplings
at ~TN and below. A low energy collective excitation is identified as a THz
instability associated with room temperature eg electrons in a d-orbital
fluctuating environment. It condenses into two modes that emerge pinned to the
E-type antiferromagmetic order hardening simultaneously down to 4 K. They obey
power laws with TN as the critical temperature and match known zone center
magnons. The one peaking at 26 cm-1, with critical exponent \b{eta}=0.42 as for
antiferromagnetic order in a hexagonal lattice, is dependent on the Rare Earth.
The band at ~50 cm-1, with \b{eta}=0.25, splits at ~TN into two peaks. The
weaker band of the two is assimilated to the upper branch of gap opening in the
transverse acoustical (TA) phonon branch crossing the magnetic dispersion found
in YMnO3. (Petit et al, 2007 PRL 99, 266604). The stronger second at ~36 cm-1
corresponds to the lower branch of the TA gap. We assign both excitations as

driven by an external field to transform NdMnO3 into a multiferroic compound by
perturbation enhancing the TA phonon-magnetic correlation.

approach to the structure of atomic nuclei. It is used in numerous
applications, from determining the limits of stability to gaining a deep
understanding of the formation of elements in the universe or the mechanisms
that power stars and reactors. The predictive power of the theory depends on
the amount of physics embedded in the energy density functional as well as on
efficient ways to determine a small number of free parameters and solve the DFT
equations. In this article, we discuss the various sources of uncertainties and
errors encountered in DFT and possible methods to quantify these uncertainties
in a rigorous manner.

visualise the rate of change, obtained from derivatives of a continuous

isogrowth curves, and solutions to differential equations. Using Australian and
Chilean fertility, we present phase-plane plots. Similarly to the scatter plot

fertility rate and displays skewness of fertility distribution. Unlike the
scatter plot and Lexis surface, the phase-plane plot identifies the age with
maximum positive or negative velocity (i.e., trend), can compare the magnitude
of the rate of change between any two years based on the size of the radius of
circles. The phase-plane plot allows the visualisation of dynamic changes in
fertility for a given age over the years and is potentially useful for
visualising dynamic changes in birth-cohort fertility. Via the animate package

integrations are necessary despite atmospheric turbulence. Fringe trackers are
needed to stabilize the fringes and thus increase the fringe visibility and
phase signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), with efficient controllers robust to
instrumental vibrations, and to subsequent path fluctuations and flux
drop-outs.
  We report on simulations, analysis and comparison of the performances of a
classical integrator controller and of a Kalman controller, both optimized to
track fringes under realistic observing conditions for different source
magnitudes, disturbance conditions, and sampling frequencies. The key
parameters of our simulations (instrument photometric performance, detection
noise, turbulence and vibrations statistics) are based on typical observing
conditions at the Very Large Telescope observatory and on the design of the
GRAVITY instrument, a 4-telescope single-mode long baseline interferometer in
the near-infrared, next in line to be installed at VLT Interferometer.
  We find that both controller performances follow a two-regime law with the
star magnitude, a constant disturbance limited regime, and a diverging detector
and photon noise limited regime. Moreover, we find that the Kalman controller
is optimal in the high and medium SNR regime due to its predictive commands
based on an accurate disturbance model. In the low SNR regime, the model is not
accurate enough to be more robust than an integrator controller. Identifying
the disturbances from high SNR measurements improves the Kalman performances in
case of strong optical path difference disturbances.

can be globally asymptotically stabilized with a decentralized PI control, that
exploits its passivity properties. Close connections between the proposed PI

Third, to reveal the transient performance limitations of the proposed

control. Fourth, motivated by the latter, an outer-loop that overcomes the
aforementioned limitations is proposed. The performance limitation of the PI,
and its drastic improvement using outer-loop controls, are verified via
simulations on a three-terminals benchmark example. A final contribution is a
novel formulation of the power flow equations for the centralized references

small unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are flexible, inexpensive and fast to
deploy. This makes them a very attractive technology for many civilian and
military applications. Due to the high mobility of the nodes, maintaining a
communication link between the UAVs is a challenging task. The topology of
these networks is more dynamic than that of typical mobile ad hoc networks
(MANETs) and of typical vehicle ad hoc networks (VANETs). As a consequence, the
existing routing protocols designed for MANETs partly fail in tracking network
topology changes. In this work, we compare two different routing algorithms for
ad hoc networks: optimized link-state routing (OLSR), and predictive-OLSR
(P-OLSR). The latter is an OLSR extension that we designed for FANETs; it takes
advantage of the GPS information available on board. To the best of our
knowledge, P-OLSR is currently the only FANET-specific routing technique that
has an available Linux implementation. We present results obtained by both
Media Access Control (MAC) layer emulations and real-world experiments. In the
experiments, we used a testbed composed of two autonomous fixed-wing UAVs and a
node on the ground. Our experiments evaluate the link performance and the
communication range, as well as the routing performance. Our emulation and
experimental results show that P-OLSR significantly outperforms OLSR in routing
in the presence of frequent network topology changes.

than expected from the stars' isochronal age, and therefore an underestimated
gyrochronology age. By comparing to planetary systems in stellar clusters, I

magnetoresistance perovskite below the Curie temperature $T_{C}$ = 70 K and
attributed to an antiferromagnetic (AFM) - ferromagnetic (FM) spontaneous phase
segregated state of this compound. Field cooled magnetic hysteresis loops
exhibit shifts toward negative direction of the magnetic field axis. The values
of exchange field $H_{EB}$ and coercivity $H_{C}$ are found to be strongly
dependent of temperature and strength of the cooling magnetic field $H_{cool}$.
These effects are attributed to evolution of the FM phase content and a size of
FM clusters. A contribution to the total magnetization of the system due to the
FM phase has been evaluated. The exchange bias effect decreases with increasing
temperature up to $T_{C}$ and vanishes above this temperature with
disappearance of FM phase. Relaxation of a non-equilibrium magnetic state of
the compound manifests itself through a training effect also observed while
studying EB in Nd2/3Ca1/3MnO3.

prior to derive posterior concentration rates for data-dependent priors (or
empirical Bayes approaches). We aim at providing conditions that are close to
the conditions provided in the seminal paper by Ghosal and van der Vaart
(2007a). We then apply the general theorem to two different settings: the
estimation of a density using Dirichlet process mixtures of Gaussian random
variables with base measure depending on some empirical quantities and the
estimation of the intensity of a counting process under the Aalen model. A
simulation study for inhomogeneous Poisson processes also illustrates our
results. In the former case we also derive some results on the estimation of
the mixing density and on the deconvolution problem. In the latter, we provide
a general theorem on posterior concentration rates for counting processes with
Aalen multiplicative intensity with priors not depending on the data.

61 and Pa 5 and explore the nature of their central stars. Our analysis is
based on high resolution and medium resolution spectroscopic observations, deep
narrow-band imaging, and integral photometry. This material allows us to
identify the morphological components and study their kinematics. The direct
images and spectra indicate an absence of the characteristic [N II] and [S II]
emission lines in both nebulae. The nebular spectrum of Kn 61 suggests an
hydrogen deficient planetary nebula and the stellar spectrum of the central
star reveals a hydrogen deficient PG 1159-type star. The [O III] position
velocity diagram reveals that Kn 61 is a closed, empty, spherical shell with a
thin border and a filamentary surface expanding at 67.6 km s$^{-1}$, and the
shell is currently not expanding isotropically. We derived a kinematic age of
$\sim$ 1.6$\times$10$^4$ yrs for an assumed distance of 4 kpc. A photometric
period of $\sim$ 5.7($\pm$0.4) days has been detected for Kn 61, indicating
presence of a possible binary system at its core. A possible link between
filamentary, spherical shells and PG 1159-type stars is noted.
  The morphology of Pa 5 is dominated by an equatorial toroid and faint polar
extensions. The equatorial region of this planetary nebula is expanding at 45.2
kms$^{-1}$. The stellar spectrum corresponds to a very hot star and is
dominated by a steep blue rising continuum and He II, Balmer and Ca II
photospheric lines.

kernels, also known as self-tuning kernels, however much of the current theory
of kernel based techniques is only applicable to fixed bandwidth kernels. In
this paper, we derive the asymptotic expansion of these variable bandwidth
kernels for arbitrary bandwidth functions; generalizing the theory of Diffusion
Maps and Laplacian Eigenmaps. We also derive pointwise error estimates for the
corresponding discrete operators which are based on finite data sets;
generalizing a result of Singer which was restricted to fixed bandwidth
kernels. Our analysis reveals how areas of small sampling density lead to large
errors, particularly for fixed bandwidth kernels. We explain the limitation of
the existing theory to data sampled from compact manifolds by showing that when
the sampling density is not bounded away from zero (which implies that the data
lies on an open set) the error estimates for fixed bandwidth kernels will be
unbounded. We show that this limitation can be overcome by choosing a bandwidth
function inversely proportional to the sampling density (which can be estimated
from data) which allows us to control the error estimates uniformly over a
non-compact manifold. We numerically verify these results on non-compact
manifolds by constructing the generator of the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process on a
real line and a two-dimensional plane using data sampled independently from the
respective invariant measures. We also verify our results on compact manifolds
by constructing the Laplacian on the unit circle and the unit sphere and we
show that the variable bandwidth kernels exhibit reduced sensitivity to
bandwidth selection and give better results for an automatic bandwidth
selection algorithm.

  systems","8 pages. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with
  arXiv:1006.3775",,,,"physics.bio-ph physics.chem-ph quant-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A generic and intuitive model for coherent energy transport in multiple
minima systems coupled to a quantum mechanical bath is shown. Using a simple
spin-boson system, we illustrate how a generic donor-acceptor system can be
brought into resonance using a narrow band of vibrational modes, such that the
transfer efficiency of an electron-hole pair (exciton) is made arbitrarily
high. Coherent transport phenomena in nature are of renewed interest since the
discovery that a photon captured by the light-harvesting complex (LHC) in
photosynthetic organisms can be conveyed to a chemical reaction centre with
near-perfect efficiency. Classical explanations of the transfer use stochastic
diffusion to model the hopping motion of a photo-excited exciton. This accounts
inadequately for the speed and efficiency of the energy transfer measured in a
series of recent landmark experiments. Taking a quantum mechanical perspective
can help capture the salient features of the efficient part of that transfer.
To show the versatility of the model, we extend it to a multiple minima system
comprising seven-sites, reminiscent of the widely studied Fenna-Matthews-Olson
(FMO) light-harvesting complex. We show that an idealised transport model for
multiple minima coupled to a narrow-band phonon can transport energy with
arbitrarily high efficiency.
