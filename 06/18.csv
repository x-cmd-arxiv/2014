Understanding how to find targets with very limited information is a topic
of interest in many disciplines. In ecology, such research has often focused on
the development of two movement models: i) the L\'evy walk and; ii) the
composite correlated random walk and its associated area-restricted search
behaviour. Although the processes underlying these models differ, they can
produce similar movement patterns. Due to this similarity and because of their
disparate formulation, current methods cannot reliably differentiate between
these two models.
  2. Here, we present a method that differentiates between the two models. It
consists of likelihood functions, including one for a hidden Markov model, and
associated statistical measures that assess the relative support for and
absolute fit of each model.
  3. Using a simulation study, we show that our method can differentiate
between the two search models over a range of parameter values. Using the
movement data of two polar bears (\textit{Ursus maritimus}), we show that the
method can be applied to complex, real-world movement paths.
  4. By providing the means to differentiate between the two most prominent
search models in the literature, and a framework that could be extended to
include other models, we facilitate further research into the strategies
animals use to find resources.

that X-ray masses can be underestimated by 10% to 30%. The largest bias
originates by both violation of hydrostatic equilibrium and an additional
temperature bias caused by inhomogeneities in the X-ray emitting intra-cluster
medium (ICM). To elucidate on this large dispersion among theoretical
predictions, we evaluate the degree of temperature structures in cluster sets
simulated either with smoothed-particle-hydrodynamics (SPH) and
adaptive-mesh-refinement (AMR) codes. We find that the SPH simulations produce
larger temperature variations connected to the persistence of both
substructures and their stripped cold gas. This difference is more evident in
no-radiative simulations, while it is reduced in the presence of radiative
cooling. We also find that the temperature variation in radiative cluster
simulations is generally in agreement with the observed one in the central
regions of clusters. Around R_500 the temperature inhomogeneities of the SPH
simulations can generate twice the typical hydrostatic-equilibrium mass bias of
the AMR sample. We emphasize that a detailed understanding of the physical
processes responsible for the complex thermal structure in ICM requires
improved resolution and high sensitivity observations in order to extend the
analysis to higher temperature systems and larger cluster-centric radii.

circular trajectories near surfaces. Fluid dynamics predicts this circular
motion to be clockwise (CW) above a rigid surface (when viewed from inside the
fluid) and counter-clockwise (CCW) below a free surface. Recent experimental
investigations showed that complex physicochemical processes at the nearby
surface could lead to a change in the direction of rotation, both at solid
surfaces absorbing slip-inducing polymers and interfaces covered with
surfactants. Motivated by these results, we use a far-field hydrodynamic model
to predict the kinematics of swimming near three types of interfaces: clean
fluid-fluid interface, slipping rigid wall, and a fluid interface covered by
incompressible surfactants. Representing the helical swimmer by a superposition
of hydrodynamic singularities, we first show that in all cases the surfaces
reorient the swimmer parallel to the surface and attract it, both of which are
a consequence of the Stokes dipole component of the swimmer flow field. We then
show that circular motion is induced by a higher-order singularity, namely a
rotlet dipole, and that its rotation direction (CW vs. CCW) is strongly
affected by the boundary conditions at the interface and the bacteria shape.
Our results suggest thus that the hydrodynamics of complex interfaces provide a
mechanism to selectively stir bacteria.

seen in high-redshift galaxies. We base this analysis on Hubble Space Telescope
COS spectra of four Green Pea (GP) galaxies, which may be analogs of z>2
Ly-alpha emitters (LAEs). In the two GPs with the strongest Ly-alpha emission,
the Ly-alpha line profiles show reduced signs of resonant scattering. Instead,
the Ly-alpha profiles resemble the H-alpha line profiles of evolved star
ejecta, suggesting that the Ly-alpha emission originates from a low column
density and similar outflow geometry. The weak C II absorption and presence of
non-resonant C II* emission in these GPs support this interpretation and imply
a low LyC optical depth along the line of sight. In two additional GPs, weak
Ly-alpha emission and strong C II absorption suggest a higher optical depth.
These two GPs differ in their Ly-alpha profile shapes and C II* emission
strengths, however, indicating different inclinations of the outflows to our
line of sight. With these four GPs as examples, we explain the observed trends
linking Ly-alpha, C II, and C II* in stacked LAE spectra, in the context of
optical depth and geometric effects. Specifically, in some galaxies with strong
Ly-alpha emission, a low LyC optical depth may allow Ly-alpha to escape with
reduced scattering. Furthermore, C II absorption, C II* emission, and Ly-alpha
profile shape can reveal the optical depth, constrain the orientation of
neutral outflows in LAEs, and identify candidate LyC emitters.

single mutant is the same on all regular networks. But non-regular networks can
increase or decrease the fixation probability. While the time until fixation
formally depends on the same transition probabilities as the fixation
probabilities, there is no obvious relation between them. For example, an
amplifier of selection, which increases the fixation probability and thus
decreases the number of mutations needed until one of them is successful, can
at the same time slow down the process of fixation. Based on small networks, we
show analytically that (i) the time to fixation can decrease when links are
removed from the network and (ii) the node providing the best starting

  Schemes for the BGK Equation",,,"10.1016/j.jcp.2014.12.021",,"math.NA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, we develop high-order asymptotic preserving (AP) schemes for
the BGK equation in a hyperbolic scaling, which leads to the macroscopic models
such as the Euler and compressible Navier-Stokes equations in the asymptotic
limit. Our approaches are based on the so-called micro-macro formulation of the
kinetic equation which involves a natural decomposition of the problem to the
equilibrium and the non-equilibrium parts. The proposed methods are formulated
for the BGK equation with constant or spatially variant Knudsen number. The new
ingredients for the proposed methods to achieve high order accuracy are the
following: we introduce discontinuous Galerkin (DG) discretization of arbitrary
order of accuracy with nodal Lagrangian basis functions in space; we employ a
high order globally stiffly accurate implicit-explicit (IMEX) Runge-Kutta (RK)
scheme as time discretization. Two versions of the schemes are proposed: Scheme
I is a direct formulation based on the micro-macro decomposition of the BGK
equation, while Scheme II, motivated by the asymptotic analysis for the
continuous problem, utilizes certain properties of the projection operator.
Compared with Scheme I, Scheme II not only has better computational efficiency
(the computational cost is reduced by half roughly), but also allows the
establishment of a formal asymptotic analysis. Specifically, it is demonstrated
that when $0<\epsilon \ll 1$, Scheme II, up to $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^2)$,
becomes a local DG discretization with an explicit RK method for the
macroscopic compressible Navier-Stokes equations, a method in a similar spirit
to the ones in [Bassi \& Rabey 1997, Cockburn \& Shu 1998]. Numerical results
are presented for a wide range of Knudsen number to illustrate the
effectiveness and high order accuracy of the methods.

both scaling laws by modeling the usage of words by simple stochastic processes
in which the overall distribution of word-frequencies is fat tailed (Zipf's
law) and the frequency of a single word is subject to fluctuations across
documents (as in topic models). In this framework, the mean and the variance of
the vocabulary size can be expressed as quenched averages, implying that: i)
the inhomogeneous dissemination of words cause a reduction of the average
vocabulary size in comparison to the homogeneous case, and ii) correlations in
the co-occurrence of words lead to an increase in the variance and the
vocabulary size becomes a non-self-averaging quantity. We address the
implications of these observations to the measurement of lexical richness. We
test our results in three large text databases (Google-ngram, Enlgish

It has been shown that in such systems binary relations of magnitudes of

associations of pre- and proto- stellar cores with the filaments suggest a
direct link with the process of star formation. Any study of the properties of
such filaments requires a representative samples from different enviroments and
so an unbiased detection method. We developed such an approach using the
Hessian matrix of a surface-brightness distribution to identify filaments and
determine their physical and morphological properties. After testing the method
on simulated, but realistic filaments, we apply the algorithms to
column-density maps computed from Herschel observations of the Galactic Plane
obtained by the Hi-GAL project. We identified ~500 filaments, in the longitude
range of l=216.5 to l=225.5, with lengths from ~1 pc up to ~30 pc and widths
between 0.1 pc and 2.5 pc. Average column densities are between 10^20 cm^-2 and
10^22 cm^-2. Filaments include the majority of dense material with N_H_2 >
6x10^21cm^-2. We find that the pre- and proto-stellar compact sources already
identified in the same region are mostly associated with filaments. However,
surface densities in excess of the expected critical values for high-mass star
formation are only found on the filaments, indicating that these structures are
necessary to channel material into the clumps. Furthermore, we analyze the
gravitational stability of filaments and discuss their relationship with star
formation.

network scenarios. The main problem in this respect is due to interaction among
queues. When transmission probabilities during successive transmissions change,
e.g., when exponential backoff mechanism is exploited, the interactions in the
network are stimulated. In this paper, we derive the stability region of a
buffered slotted Aloha network with K-exponential backoff mechanism,
approximately, when a finite number of nodes exist. To this end, we propose a
new approach in modeling the interaction among wireless nodes. In this
approach, we model the network with inter-related quasi-birth-death (QBD)
processes such that at each QBD corresponding to each node, a finite number of
phases consider the status of the other nodes. Then, by exploiting the
available theorems on stability of QBDs, we find the stability region. We show
that exponential backoff mechanism is able to increase the area of the
stability region of a simple slotted Aloha network with two nodes, more than
40\%. We also show that a slotted Aloha network with exponential backoff may
perform very near to ideal scheduling. The accuracy of our modeling approach is
verified by simulation in different conditions.

successively through two different media with opposite dispersions,

exploit available paths through multiple network interfaces. MPTCP is
particularly useful for mobile devices, which usually have multiple wireless
interfaces. However, these devices have limited power capacity and thus
judicious use of these interfaces is required. In this work, we develop a model
for MPTCP energy consumption derived from experimental measurements using MPTCP
on a mobile device with both cellular and WiFi interfaces. Using our energy
model, we identify an operating region where there is scope to improve power
efficiency compared to both standard TCP and MPTCP. We design and implement an
improved energy-efficient MPTCP, called eMPTCP. We evaluate eMPTCP on a mobile
device across several scenarios, including varying bandwidth, background
traffic, and user mobility. Our results show that eMPTCP can reduce the power
consumption by up to 15% compared with MPTCP, while preserving the availability
and robustness benefits of MPTCP. Furthermore, we show that when compared with
TCP over WiFi, which is more energy efficient than TCP over LTE, eMPTCP obtains
significantly better performance with relatively little additional energy
overhead.

note fluctuation is $\sqrt{S_\hat{\nu}(f)} = (0.5\,\mathrm{Hz})/f^{1/2}$. By
careful budgeting of noise sources contributing to the beat note, we find that
our measurement is consistent with the fluctuation in this band being dominated
by the Brownian noise of the mirror coatings. Fitting for the coating loss

their properties were studied in the recent years by several authors due to
their importance in cryptography. In particular, Peikert and Rosen showed that
on cyclic lattices in prime dimensions, the shortest independent vectors
problem SIVP reduces to the shortest vector problem SVP with a particularly
small loss in approximation factor, as compared to general lattices. In this
paper, we further investigate geometric properties of cyclic lattices. Our main
result is a counting estimate for the number of well-rounded cyclic lattices,
indicating that well-rounded lattices are more common among cyclic lattices
than generically. We also show that SVP is equivalent to SIVP on a positive

an example, we demonstrate an explicit construction of a family of such

applications. Among all motion estimation approaches, Block-matching (BM)
algorithms are the most popular methods due to their effectiveness and
simplicity for both software and hardware implementations. A BM approach
assumes that the movement of pixels within a defined region of the current
frame can be modeled as a translation of pixels contained in the previous
frame. In this procedure, the motion vector is obtained by minimizing a certain
matching metric that is produced for the current frame over a determined search
window from the previous frame. Unfortunately, the evaluation of such matching
measurement is computationally expensive and represents the most consuming
operation in the BM process. Therefore, BM motion estimation can be viewed as
an optimization problem whose goal is to find the best-matching block within a
search space. The simplest available BM method is the Full Search Algorithm
(FSA) which finds the most accurate motion vector through an exhaustive
computation of all the elements of the search space. Recently, several fast BM
algorithms have been proposed to reduce the search positions by calculating
only a fixed subset of motion vectors despite lowering its accuracy. On the
other hand, the Harmony Search (HS) algorithm is a population-based
optimization method that is inspired by the music improvisation process in
which a musician searches for harmony and continues to polish the pitches to
obtain a better harmony. In this paper, a new BM algorithm that combines HS
with a fitness approximation model is proposed. The approach uses motion
vectors belonging to the search window as potential solutions. A fitness
function evaluates the matching quality of each motion vector candidate.

little influence on the band offsets, although it affects the spatial
localization of the quantum states from the individual components. Comparing
the influence of strain on coupled quantum dots and core/shell nanowires, we
find strain practically has no role in the electronic structure of coupled
quantum dots as the small effective area of the interface in a coupled quantum
dot helps a large part of the structure remain free from any substantial
strain. We argue that in contrast to core-shell nanowires, quantum confinement
is the key parameter that controls the electronic properties of coupled quantum
dot and should therefore be an ideal candidate for the design of a quantum
device.

investigating the signatures of warm absorption and Compton reflection reported
from previous Suzaku and XMM-Newton studies of the source. Contrary to previous
results, we find that warm absorption is not required by the data. Instead, we
report upper limits on absorption lines that are below previous (marginal)
detections. Fe Ka line emission is clearly detected and is likely resolved with
sigma ~ 0.02 keV with the HETG data. We applied self-consistent, broadband
spectral-fitting models to the HETG and Suzaku data to investigate this and
other signatures of distant absorption and reflection. Utilizing in particular
the MYTorus model, we find that the data are consistent with reprocessing by a
distant, neutral torus that is Compton thick and out of the line-of-sight.
However, we do not find compelling evidence of a relativistically-broadened
Fe-K emission line, which is often expected from type 1 AGN. This is consistent
with some, although not all, previous studies of MCG +8-11-11. A well-measured
edge is identified by the HETG near 0.5 keV, indicating neutral absorption in
the line of sight that is consistent with galactic absorption; however, the
absorption may be partially intrinsic to the source. The HETG data are
consistent with the presence of a soft excess, a feature that may be missed by
considering the Suzaku data alone.

we identify signatures of endogenous and exogenous factors in the S-curves of

three different methods to estimate it from S-curves. We obtain cases in which
the exogenous factors are dominant (in the adoption of German orthographic

dominant (in the adoption of conventions for romanization of Russian names and
in the regularization of most studied verbs). These results show that the shape

chiral-symmetry-breaking, fully gapped, charge-density-wave order even for

strong magnetic fields. In the former systems, due to the natural momentum
space separation of Weyl nodes the ordered phase lacks the translational
symmetry and represents an axionic phase of matter, while that in a Dirac
semimetal (neglecting the Zeeman coupling) is only a trivial insulator. We
present the scaling of this spectral gap for a wide range of subcritical (weak)

high rate of redshift completeness (97.6 %), and includes improved photometric
redshifts over previous studies. We use spectral models designed for heavily
obscured AGN which self consistently include all major spectral signatures of
heavy absorption. We identify CT sources not selected through our spectral
fitting method using X-ray colours, validate our spectral fitting method
through simulations, and take considerations for the constraints on $N_{H}$
given the low count nature of many of our sources. After these considerations
we identify a total of 100 CT AGN with best-fit $N_{H}>10^{24} cm^{-2}$ and
$N_{H}$ constrained to be above $10^{23.5} cm^{-2}$ at 90% confidence. These
sources cover an intrinsic $L_{X}$ range of $10^{42}-3x10^{45}$ ergs s$^{-1}$
and a redshift range of z=0.1-4. This sample will enable characterisation of
these heavily obscured AGN across cosmic time and to ascertain their
cosmological significance. Furthermore, by using the torus models to test
different covering factor scenarios, and by investigating the inclusion of the
soft scattered emission, we find evidence that the covering factor of the
obscuring material decreases with $L_{X}$ for all redshifts, consistent with
the receding torus model, and that this factor increases with redshift,
consistent with an increase in the obscured fraction towards higher redshifts.
We make $N_{H}$, $\Gamma$ (with uncertainties), observed X-ray fluxes and
intrinsic $L_{X}$ for all sources analysed in this work publicly available in

formation rate (SFR), gas-phase metallicity, gas-mass fraction, and Ly$\alpha$
velocity offset. We find that LAEs may lie below the mass-metallicity relation
for continuum-selected star-forming galaxies at the same redshift. The LAEs all
show velocity shifts of Ly$\alpha$ relative to the systemic redshift ranging
between +85 and +296 km s$^{-1}$ with a mean of +180 km s$^{-1}$. This value is
smaller than measured for continuum-selected star-forming galaxies at similar
redshifts. The Ly$\alpha$ velocity offsets show a moderate correlation with the
measured star formation rate (2.5$\sigma$), but no significant correlations are
seen with the SFR surface density, specific SFR, stellar mass, or dynamical
mass ($\lesssim$ 1.5$\sigma$). Exploring the role of dust, kinematics of the
interstellar medium (ISM), and geometry on the escape of Ly$\alpha$ photons, we
find no signature of selective quenching of resonantly scattered Ly$\alpha$
photons. However, we also find no evidence that a clumpy ISM is enhancing the
Ly$\alpha$ equivalent width. Our results suggest that the low metallicity in
LAEs may be responsible for yielding an environment with a low neutral hydrogen
column density as well as less dust, easing the escape of Ly$\alpha$ photons

Most importantly, the clumpy nature of the interstellar medium has a major
impact on the the dynamical evolution of the SMBH pair, which undergo
gravitational encounters with massive gas clouds and stochastic torquing by
both clouds and spiral modes in the disk. These effects combine to greatly
delay the decay of the two SMBHs to separations of a few parsecs by nearly two
orders of magnitude, $\sim 10^8$ yr, compared to previous work. In mergers of
more gas-rich, clumpier galaxies at high redshift stochastic torques will be
even more pronounced and potentially lead to stronger modulation of the orbital
decay. This suggests that SMBH pairs at separations of several tens of parsecs
should be relatively common at any redshift.

local (U)LIRGs, in which its data quality mimics the high-z dataset. Based on
the Gini-M20 classification scheme, we find that the fraction of interacting
systems decreases by ~8% from local to z<~1, and it is consistent with the
reduction between local and redshifted datasets (6(+14-6)%). Based on visual
classifications, the merger fraction of local ULIRGs is found to be ~20% lower

15(+10-8)%. Consequently, the differences of merger fractions between local and

For stronger fields, these effects are usually suppressed or quenched, and
additional anisotropies are introduced. Using different variants of the
test-field method, we determine the quenching of the turbulent transport
coefficients for the forced Roberts flow, isotropically forced non-helical
turbulence, and rotating thermal convection. We see significant quenching only
when the mean magnetic field is larger than the equipartition value of the
turbulence. Expressing the magnetic field in terms of the equipartition value
of the {\it quenched} flows, we obtain for the quenching exponents of the
turbulent magnetic diffusivity about 1.3, 1.1, and 1.3 for Roberts flow, forced
turbulence, and convection, respectively. However, when the magnetic field is
expressed in terms of the equipartition value of the unquenched flows these
quenching exponents become about 4, 1.5, and 2.3, respectively. For the
$\alpha$ effect, the exponent is about 1.3 for the Roberts flow and 2 for
convection in the first case, but 4 and 3, respectively, in the second. In
convection, the quenching of turbulent pumping follows the same power law as
turbulent diffusion, while for the coefficient describing the $\bf \Omega
\times \bf J$ effect nearly the same quenching exponent is obtained as for
$\alpha$. For forced turbulence, turbulent diffusion proportional to the second
derivative along the mean magnetic field is quenched much less, especially for
larger values of the magnetic Reynolds number. However, we find that in
corresponding axisymmetric mean-field dynamos with dominant toroidal field the
quenched diffusion coefficients are the same for the poloidal and toroidal

forcing applied by a wall on one edge of the packing. We measure the response
experienced by a wall on the opposite edge of the packing and obtain the
resonant frequency of the packing as the static or dynamic pressures are
varied. Under increasing static pressure, the resonant frequency increases,
indicating a velocity increase of elastic waves propagating through the
packing. In contrast, when the dynamic amplitude is increased for fixed static
pressure, the resonant frequency decreases, indicating a decrease in the wave
velocity. This occurs both for compressional and for shear dynamic forcing, and
is in agreement with experimental results. We find that the average contact
number $Z_c$ at the resonant frequency decreases with increasing dynamic
amplitude, indicating that the elastic softening of the packing is associated
with a reduced number of grain-grain contacts through which the elastic waves
can travel. We image the excitations created in the packing and show that there
are localized disturbances or soft spots that become more prevalent with
increasing dynamic amplitude. Our results are in agreement with experiments on
glass bead packings and earth materials such as sandstone and granite, and may
be relevant to the decrease in elastic wave velocities that has been observed

  arXiv:1406.4354",,,,"physics.hist-ph hep-th","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We have two aims. The main one is to expound the idea of renormalization in
quantum field theory, with no technical prerequisites (Sections 2 and 3). Our
motivation is that renormalization is undoubtedly one of the great ideas, and
great successes, of twentieth-century physics. Also it has strongly influenced
in diverse ways, how physicists conceive of physical theories. So it is of
considerable philosophical interest. Second, we will briefly relate
renormalization to Ernest Nagel's account of inter-theoretic relations,
especially reduction (Section 4).
  One theme will be a contrast between two approaches to renormalization. The
old approach, which prevailed from ca. 1945 to 1970, treated renormalizability
as a necessary condition for being an acceptable quantum field theory. On this
approach, it is a piece of great good fortune that high energy physicists can
formulate renormalizable quantum field theories that are so empirically
successful. But the new approach to renormalization (from 1970 onwards)
explains why the phenomena we see, at the energies we can access in our
particle accelerators, are described by a renormalizable quantum field theory.
For whatever non-renormalizable interactions may occur at yet higher energies,
they are insignificant at accessible energies. Thus the new approach explains
why our best fundamental theories have a feature, viz. renormalizability, which
the old approach treated as a selection principle for theories.
  We also maintain that universality, a concept stressed in renormalization
theory, is essentially the familiar philosophical idea of multiple
realizability; and that it causes no problems for reductions of a Nagelian
kind.

directional transience and ballisticity and have served to quantify the gap
which would need to be proven in order to answer affirmatively this conjecture.
Two important ballisticity conditions introduced by Sznitman \cite{Sz02} in
2001 and 2002 are the so called conditions $(T')$ and $(T)$: given a slab of
width $L$ orthogonal to $l$, condition $(T')$ in direction $l$ is the
requirement that the annealed exit probability of the walk through the side of
the slab in the half-space $\{x:x\cdot l<0\}$, decays faster than
$e^{-CL^\gamma}$ for all $\gamma\in (0,1)$ and some constant $C>0$, while
condition $(T)$ in direction $l$ is the requirement that the decay is
exponential $e^{-CL}$. It is believed that $(T')$ implies $(T)$. In this
article we show that $(T')$ implies at least an {\it almost} (in a sense to be
made precise) exponential decay.

better understand the formation of the thick disk. The stars I consider are
mostly within 1 kpc of the Sun. Based on a Monte-Carlo analysis of the data and
comparison with a toy model, I suggest the thick disk formed fairly rapidly
when [Mg/Fe] ${\approx}$0.2-0.3. We consider an origin via direct accretion
unlikely as the thick disk is fast-rotating and fairly metal-rich for its age.
As internal disk heating can not easily reach the high observed velocity
dispersions and would likely be more gradual, it also appears implausible. A
very early formation of the thick disk (e.g. from star formation in the
collapsing primordial gas cloud of the Milky Way) appears unlikely given it
would require [Mg/Fe] ${\geq}$ 0.4 at the time the thick disk formed. An origin
via tidal interaction with another galaxy is one of the few remaining
possibilities. My proposed explanation for the nature of the event which formed
the thick disk is a close flyby of Andromeda, whose orbital dynamics in MOND
are consistent with my estimate that the event occurred 7-11 Gyr ago. This
leads to reasonable thick disk velocity dispersions. It will be important to
determine whether the event heated the outer regions of the thin disk uniformly
or if substantial portions of it were left largely unaffected. This may
distinguish between models (like mine) involving a single close encounter and
models with multiple encounters (as common in mergers). The main limiting
factor at present seems to be the accuracy of elemental abundances and lack of
direct observations at different galactocentric radii to the Sun.

applied under more general conditions including the case ofnon stationary
series and relatively short series. We also present a robust version of our
procedure that allows to estimate the DPC when the series have outlier
contamination. Our non robust and robust procedures are illustrated with real
datasets.

atmospheres. These atmospheres can play an important role on the planet's spin
evolution, since thermal atmospheric tides, driven by the host star, may
counterbalance gravitational tides. In this work we study the long-term spin
evolution of Earth-sized exoplanets. We generalize previous works by including
the effect of eccentric orbits and obliquity. We show that under the effect of
tides and core-mantle friction, the obliquity of the planets evolve either to 0
or 180 degrees. The rotation of these planets is also expected to evolve into a
very restricted number of equilibrium configurations. In general, none of this
equilibria is synchronous with the orbital mean motion. The role of thermal
atmospheric tides becomes more important for Earth-sized planets in the
habitable zones of their systems, so they cannot be neglected when we search
for their potential habitability.

plane. We argue that for interacting quantum field theories in more than two
dimensions, this entropy has a simple expression in terms of the expectation
value of the null components of the stress tensor on the null interval. More
explicitly $\Delta S = 2\pi \int d^{d-2}y \int_0^1 dx^+\, g(x^+)\, \langle
T_{++}\rangle$, where $g(x^+)$ is a theory-dependent function. This function is
constrained by general properties of quantum relative entropy. These
constraints are enough to extend our recent free field proof of the quantum
Bousso bound to the interacting case.
  This unusual expression for the entropy as the expectation value of an
operator implies that the entropy is equal to the modular Hamiltonian, $\Delta
S = \langle \Delta K \rangle $, where $K$ is the operator in the right hand
side. We explain how this equality is compatible with a non-zero value for
$\Delta S$. Finally, we also compute explicitly the function $g(x^+)$ for
theories that have a gravity dual.

binary linear code of length $tk$ and dimension $k$ is called a complementary
information set code of order $t$ ($t$-CIS code for short) if it has $t$
pairwise disjoint information sets. The duals of such codes permit to reduce
the cost of masking cryptographic algorithms against side-channel attacks. As
in the case of codes for error correction, given the length and the dimension
of a $t$-CIS code, we look for the highest possible minimum distance. In this
paper, this new class of codes is investigated. The existence of good long CIS
codes of order $3$ is derived by a counting argument. General constructions
based on cyclic and quasi-cyclic codes and on the building up construction are
given. A formula similar to a mass formula is given. A classification of 3-CIS
codes of length $\le 12$ is given. Nonlinear codes better than linear codes are
derived by taking binary images of $\Z_4$-codes. A general algorithm based on
Edmonds' basis packing algorithm from matroid theory is developed with the
following property: given a binary linear code of rate $1/t$ it either provides
$t$ disjoint information sets or proves that the code is not $t$-CIS. Using
this algorithm, all optimal or best known $[tk, k]$ codes where $t=3, 4, \dots,

deterministic sampling we obtain a discrepancy of $O(n^{-1/d})$ for $d\ge2$.
For random stratified sampling, and scrambled van der Corput points, we get a
mean squared error of $O(n^{-1-2/d})$ for integration of Lipshitz continuous
integrands, when $d\ge3$. These rates are the same as one gets by sampling on
$d$ dimensional grids and they show a deterioration with increasing $d$. The
rate for Lipshitz functions is however best possible at that level of
smoothness and is better than plain IID sampling. Unlike grids, space-filling
curve sampling provides points at any desired sample size, and the van der
Corput version is extensible in $n$. Additionally we show that certain
discontinuous functions with infinite variation in the sense of Hardy and
Krause can be integrated with a mean squared error of $O(n^{-1-1/d})$. It was
previously known only that the rate was $o(n^{-1})$. Other space-filling
curves, such as those due to Sierpinski and Peano, also attain these rates,

interacts with standard fields. We then show that the instability is more

compatibility with observational constraints implies that low energy effective
ghosts can exist only at the price of giving up Lorentz-invariance or locality
above the cut-off, in which case the cut-off has to be much lower that the
energy scales we currently probe in particle colliders. We also comment on the

behavior of the autocorrelation times of these observables on periodic and open

create a stochastic background. This background is expected to contain unique
information from throughout the history of the universe that is unavailable
through standard electromagnetic observations, making its study of fundamental
importance to understanding the evolution of the universe. We carry out a
search for the stochastic background with the latest data from LIGO and Virgo.
Consistent with predictions from most stochastic gravitational-wave background
models, the data display no evidence of a stochastic gravitational-wave signal.
Assuming a gravitational-wave spectrum of
Omega_GW(f)=Omega_alpha*(f/f_ref)^alpha, we place 95% confidence level upper
limits on the energy density of the background in each of four frequency bands
spanning 41.5-1726 Hz. In the frequency band of 41.5-169.25 Hz for a spectral
index of alpha=0, we constrain the energy density of the stochastic background
to be Omega_GW(f)<5.6x10^-6. For the 600-1000 Hz band, Omega_GW(f)<0.14*(f/900
Hz)^3, a factor of 2.5 lower than the best previously reported upper limits. We
find Omega_GW(f)<1.8x10^-4 using a spectral index of zero for 170-600 Hz and
Omega_GW(f)<1.0*(f/1300 Hz)^3 for 1000-1726 Hz, bands in which no previous
direct limits have been placed. The limits in these four bands are the lowest
direct measurements to date on the stochastic background. We discuss the
implications of these results in light of the recent claim by the BICEP2
experiment of the possible evidence for inflationary gravitational waves.

  We then consider the expected value of this power series over random,
$d$-regular graph on $n$ vertices, with $d$ fixed and $n$ tending to infinity.
Under rather speculative assumptions, we make a formal calculation that
suggests that for fixed $d$ and $n$ large, this expected value should have
simple poles of residue $-1/2$ at $\pm (d-1)^{-1/2}$. We shall explain that
calculation suggests that for fixed $d$ there is an $f(d)>1/2$ such that a
$d$-regular graph on $n$ vertices is Ramanujan with probability at least $f(d)$
for $n$ sufficiently large.
  Our formal computation has a natural analogue when we consider random
covering graphs of degree $n$ over a fixed, regular ""base graph."" This again
suggests that for $n$ large, a strict majority of random covering graphs are
relatively Ramanujan.
  We do not regard our formal calculations as providing overwhelming evidence
regarding the frequency of Ramanujan graphs. However, these calculations are
quite simple, and yield intiguing suggestions which we feel merit further
study.

corresponding to a heavier and a lighter scalar particle. Each model is solved
via the complex Langevin method, following the approach of Aarts and James, and

mechanical compression effect on the thermal conductivity of the single-walled
carbon nanotube (SWCNT) forest, in which SWCNTs are closely aligned and
parallel with each other. We find that the thermal conductivity can be linearly
enhanced by increasing compression before the buckling of SWCNT forests, but
the thermal conductivity decreases quickly with further increasing compression
after the forest is buckled. Our phonon mode analysis reveals that, before
buckling, the smoothness of the inter-tube interface is maintained during
compression, and the inter-tube van der Waals interaction is strengthened by
the compression. Consequently, the twisting-like mode (good heat carrier) is
well preserved and its group velocity is increased by increasing compression,
resulting in the enhancement of the thermal conductivity. The buckling
phenomenon changes the circular cross section of the SWCNT into ellipse, which
causes effective roughness at the inter-tube interface for the twisting motion.
As a result, in ellipse SWCNTs, the radial breathing mode (poor heat carrier)
becomes the most favorable motion instead of the twisting-like mode, leading to
the quick decrease of the thermal conductivity with further increasing
compression after buckling.

scale, against some previous suppositions, we show that the system entropy $S$
is not sufficient to govern the time scale defined by structural relaxation
time $\tau $. In the density scaling regime, we argue that the decoupling
between $\tau $ and $S$ is a consequence of different values of the scaling
exponents $\gamma $ and $\gamma_S $ in the density scaling laws, $\tau = f(\rho
^\gamma /T)$ and $S = h(\rho ^{\gamma_S}/T)$, where $\rho $ and $T$ denote
density and temperature, respectively. It implies that the proper relation
between $\tau $ and $S$ requires supplementing with a density factor,
$u(\rho)$, i.e.,$\tau = g(u(\rho)w(S))$. This meaningful finding additionally
demonstrates that the density scaling idea can be successfully used to separate
physically relevant contributions to the time scale of molecular dynamics near
the glass transition. As an example, we revise the Avramov entropic model of
the dependence $\tau (T,\rho)$, giving evidence that its entropic basis has to
be extended by the density dependence of the maximal energy barrier for
structural relaxation. We also discuss the excess entropy $S_{ex}$, the density
scaling of which is found to mimic the density scaling of the total system

with high mobilities and saturation velocities in the full-band Monte Carlo
analysis of the Boltzmann transport equation. It is also found that monolayer
MX$_2$ crystals with an exception of MoSe$_2$ generally show hole mobilities
comparable to or even larger than the value for bulk silicon at room
temperature, suggesting a potential opportunity in p-type devices. The analysis
is extended to estimate the effective deformation potential constants for a

being absent at tree-level. From the operator mixing pattern, we classify all
such RG-induced phenomena and underlying models that can induce them. We then
calculate the full one-loop QCD RG evolution as the leading estimator of the
effects and address the question of which RG-induced phenomena have largest and
observable effects. The answer is related to the color structure of QCD. The
studied topics include the RG-induction of top asymmetries, polarizations and
polarization mixings as well as issues arising at this order. The RG-induction
of top asymmetries is further compared with the generation of asymmetries from
QCD and QED at one-loop order. We finally discuss the validity of using the RG
as the proxy of one-loop effects on the top pair production. As an aside, we
clarify the often-studied relations between top pair observables.

tools assume that all samples are tips, they do not allow for this possibility.
We have developed and implemented a Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)
algorithm to infer what we call sampled ancestor trees, that is, trees in which
sampled individuals can be direct ancestors of other sampled individuals. We
use a family of birth-death models where individuals may remain in the tree
process after the sampling, in particular we extend the birth-death skyline
model [Stadler et al, 2013] to sampled ancestor trees. This method allows the
detection of sampled ancestors as well as estimation of the probability that an
individual will be removed from the process when it is sampled. We show that
sampled ancestor birth-death models where all samples come from different time
points are non-identifiable and thus require one parameter to be known in order
to infer other parameters. We apply this method to epidemiological data, where
the possibility of sampled ancestors enables us to identify individuals that
infected other individuals after being sampled and to infer fundamental
epidemiological parameters. We also apply the method to infer divergence times
and diversification rates when fossils are included among the species samples,
so that fossilisation events are modelled as a part of the tree branching
process. Such modelling has many advantages as argued in literature. The
sampler is available as an open-source BEAST2 package

(VARMA) models that allows estimation of parameters under the constraints of
causality and invertibility. The parameter constraints associated with a causal
invertible VARMA model are highly complex. Currently there are no procedures
that can maintain the constraints in the estimated VARMA process, except in the
special case of a vector autoregression (VAR), where some moment based causal
estimators are available. Even in the VAR case, the available likelihood based
estimators are not causal. The maximum likelihood estimator based on the full
likelihood that does not condition on the initial observations by definition
satisfies the causal invertible constraints but optimization of the likelihood
under the complex constraints is an intractable problem. The commonly used
Bayesian procedure for VAR often has posterior mass outside the causal set
because the priors are not constrained to the causal set of parameters.
  We provide an exact mathematical solution to this problem. An $m$-variate
VARMA$(p, q)$ process contains $(p+ q) m^2 + \binom{m+1}{2}$ parameters, which
must be constrained to a subset of Euclidean space in order to guarantee
causality and invertibility. This space is implicitly described in this paper,
through the device of parameterizing the entire space of block Toeplitz
matrices in terms of positive definite matrices and orthogonal matrices. The
parameterization has connection to Schur- stability of polynomials and the
associated Stein transformation that are often used in dynamical systems
literature. As an important by-product of our investigation, we generalize a
classical result in dynamical systems to provide a characterization of Schur

1 to 2012 May 31 were estimated, and there are 39 front-side events could be
fitted by the GCS model. In this work, we continue to study whether and when
these front-side FHCMEs (FFHCMEs) hit the Earth. It is found that 59\% of these
FFHCMEs hit the Earth, and for central events, whose deviation angles
$\epsilon$, which are the angles between the propagation direction and the
Sun-Earth line, are smaller than 45 degrees, the fraction increases to 75\%.
After checking the deprojected angular widths of the CMEs, we found that all of
the Earth-encountered CMEs satisfy a simple criterion that the angular width
($\omega$) is larger than twice the deviation angle ($\epsilon$). This result
suggests that some simple criteria can be used to forecast whether a CME could
hit the Earth. Furthermore, for Earth-encountered CMEs, the transit time is
found to be roughly anti-correlated with the de-projected velocity, but some
events significantly deviate from the linearity. For CMEs with similar
velocities, the differences of their transit times can be up to several days.
Such deviation is further demonstrated to be mainly caused by the CME geometry
and propagation direction, which are essential in the forecasting of CME
arrival.

finite similarity structures. An $\mathcal{FSS}$ group acts by local
similarities on a compact ultrametric space. Thompson's group $V$ is a
representative example, but there are many others.
  We show that $\mathcal{FSS}$ groups have context-free co-word problem under a
minimal additional hypothesis. As a result, we can specify a subfamily of
$\mathcal{FSS}$ groups that are potential counterexamples to the conjecture.

fluid-like atmospheres of complex physics and chemistry that are still poorly
understood. The incomplete description of these atmospheres by the models
results in serious problems with the description of spectra of these stars and
subsequent difficulties in derivation of their surface parameters. Here, we
address the problem of infrared (IR) opacities in the atmospheres of cool white
dwarfs by direct $ab$ $initio$ simulations of IR absorption of dense helium.
  Methods: We applied state-of-the-art density functional theory-based quantum
molecular dynamics simulations to obtain the time evolution of the induced
dipole moment. The IR absorption coefficients were obtained by the Fourier
transform of the dipole moment time autocorrelation function.
  Results: We found that a dipole moment is induced due to three- and more-body
simultaneous collisions between helium atoms in highly compressed helium. This
results in a significant IR absorption that is directly proportional to $\rm
\rho_{\rm He}^3$, where $\rho_{\rm He}$ is the density of helium. To our
knowledge, this absorption mechanism has never been measured or computed before
and is therefore not accounted for in the current atmosphere models. It should
dominate the other collisionally induced absorptions (CIA), arising from $\rm
H-He$ and $\rm H_2-He$ pair collisions, and therefore shape the IR spectra of
helium-dominated and pure helium atmosphere cool white dwarfs for $\rm
He/H>10^4$.
  Conclusions: Our work shows that there exists an unaccounted IR absorption
mechanism arising from the multi-collisions between He atoms in the helium-rich
atmospheres of cool white dwarfs, including pure helium atmospheres. This
absorption may be responsible for a yet unexplained frequency dependence of
near- and mid- IR spectra of helium-rich stars.

  Association Studies in presence of confounding factor",,,,,"stat.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  It is generally acknowledged that most complex diseases are affected in part
by interactions between genes and genes and/or between genes and environmental
factors. Taking into account environmental exposures and their interactions
with genetic factors in genome-wide association studies (GWAS) can help to
identify high-risk subgroups in the population and provide a better
understanding of the disease. For this reason, many methods have been developed
to detect gene-environment (G*E) interactions. Despite this, few loci that
interact with environmental exposures have been identified so far. Indeed, the
modest effect of G*E interactions as well as confounding factors entail low
statistical power to detect such interactions. In this work, we provide a
simulated dataset in order to study methods for detecting G*E interactions in
GWAS in presence of confounding factor and population structure. Our work
applies a recently introduced non-subjective method for H1 simulations called
waffect and exploits the publicly available HapMap project to build a datasets
with real genotypes and population structures. We use this dataset to study the
impact of confounding factors and compare the relative performance of popular
methods such as PLINK, random forests and linear mixed models to detect G*E
interactions. Presence of confounding factor is an obstacle to detect G*E
interactions in GWAS and the approaches considered in our power study all have
insufficient power to detect the strong simulated interaction. Our simulated
dataset could help to develop new methods which account for confounding factors
through latent exposures in order to improve power.

experimentalists are able to extract response functions which comprise the
cross section. However, analysis of the response functions separately produces
very different spectroscopic factors. Two calculations led to different
conclusions as to whether exchange currents can eliminate the discrepancies.
Neither calculation considered relativistic corrections.
  The purpose of the article is to investigate the disagreement as to whether
exchange currents are the solution to obtaining consistent spectroscopic
factors, and to show that relativistic corrections have a much greater
influence on providing this consistency.
  This calculation employs the recoil corrected continuum shell model, a model
that uses a realistic interaction, and produces non-spurious scatterings states
that are solutions to the coupled channels problems. Pionic and pair
contributions to the exchange currents were calculated as developed by Dubach,
Koch, and Donnelly. Relativistic effects are included by use of the direct
Pauli reduction.
  Contributions of the exchange currents are shown to be insufficient to
provide consistent spectroscopic factors. However, the inclusion of
relativistic corrections, that can be large, lead to more consistent
spectroscopic factors and cross sections. The influence of channel coupling is
also shown to be significant. Tests of current conservation show that inclusion
of the direct Pauli reduction produces small increases in its violation.
Response functions which depend on the transverse current are sensitive to the
lower component of relativistic wave functions, and hence, would provide a
measure of the appropriateness of any relativistic model.

also predicts the existence of a light scalar of mass less than 1 GeV that

the parameters of the model by imposing constraints from giving correct relic
abundance and satisfying bounds from direct dark matter detection, rare decays

in accommodating the gamma rays from the Galactic center is discussed as well.

arbitrary time-dependent asymptotically AdS spacetimes in any number of
dimensions. We discuss their relation, specifying a criterion for when these
two constructs coincide, and prove an inclusion relation for a general case. We
also speculate about the implications for residual entropy. Curiously, despite
each construct admitting a well-defined finite quantity related to the areas of
associated bulk surfaces, these quantities are not in one-to-one correspondence
with the defining regions of unknown. This has nontrivial implications about
holographic measures of quantum information.

requires increased flexibility in the operation of the electric grid. Storage,
broadly speaking, provides the flexibility of shifting energy over time;
network, on the other hand, provides the flexibility of shifting energy over
geographical locations. The optimal control of storage networks in stochastic
environments is an important open problem. The key challenge is that, even in
small networks, the corresponding constrained stochastic control problems on
continuous spaces suffer from curses of dimensionality, and are intractable in
general settings. For large networks, no efficient algorithm is known to give
optimal or provably near-optimal performance for this problem. This paper
provides an efficient algorithm to solve this problem with performance
guarantees. We study the operation of storage networks, i.e., a storage system
interconnected via a power network. An online algorithm, termed Online Modified
Greedy algorithm, is developed for the corresponding constrained stochastic
control problem. A sub-optimality bound for the algorithm is derived, and a
semidefinite program is constructed to minimize the bound. In many cases, the
bound approaches zero so that the algorithm is near-optimal. A task-based
distributed implementation of the online algorithm relying only on local
information and neighbor communication is then developed based on the
alternating direction method of multipliers. Numerical examples verify the
established theoretical performance bounds, and demonstrate the scalability of
the algorithm.

oblique whistler turbulence in presence of a relatively intense external
magnetic field $b_0 {\bf e_\parallel}$. In this situation, turbulence is
strongly anisotropic and the fluid equations describing both regimes are the
reduced electron magnetohydrodynamics (REMHD) whose derivation, originally made
from the gyrokinetic theory, is also obtained here from compressible Hall MHD.
We use the asymptotic equations derived by Galtier \& Bhattacharjee (2003) to
study the REMHD dynamics in the weak turbulence regime. The analysis is focused
on the magnetic helicity equation for which we obtain the exact solutions: they
correspond to the entanglement relation, $n+\tilde n = -6$, where $n$ and
$\tilde n$ are the power law indices of the perpendicular (to ${\bf b_0}$) wave
number magnetic energy and helicity spectra respectively. Therefore, the
spectra derived in the past from the energy equation only, namely $n=-2.5$ and
$\tilde n = - 3.5$, are not the unique solutions to this problem but rather
characterize the direct energy cascade. The solution $\tilde n = -3$ is a limit
imposed by the locality condition; it is also the constant helicity flux
solution obtained heuristically. The results obtained offer a new paradigm to
understand solar wind turbulence at sub-ion scales where it is often observed
that $-3 < n < -2.5$.

quantile regression. A \emph{conditional vector quantile function} (CVQF) of a
random vector $Y$, taking values in $\mathbb{R}^d$ given covariates $Z=z$,
taking values in $\mathbb{R}% ^k$, is a map $u \longmapsto Q_{Y\mid Z}(u,z)$,
which is monotone, in the sense of being a gradient of a convex function, and
such that given that vector $U$ follows a reference non-atomic distribution
$F_U$, for instance uniform distribution on a unit cube in $\mathbb{R}^d$, the
random vector $Q_{Y\mid Z}(U,z)$ has the distribution of $Y$ conditional on
$Z=z$. Moreover, we have a strong representation, $Y = Q_{Y\mid Z}(U,Z)$ almost
surely, for some version of $U$. The \emph{vector quantile regression} (VQR) is
a linear model for CVQF of $Y$ given $Z$. Under correct specification, the
notion produces strong representation, $Y=\beta \left(U\right) ^\top f(Z)$, for
$f(Z)$ denoting a known set of transformations of $Z$, where $u \longmapsto
\beta(u)^\top f(Z)$ is a monotone map, the gradient of a convex function, and
the quantile regression coefficients $u \longmapsto \beta(u)$ have the
interpretations analogous to that of the standard scalar quantile regression.
As $f(Z)$ becomes a richer class of transformations of $Z$, the model becomes
nonparametric, as in series modelling. A key property of VQR is the embedding
of the classical Monge-Kantorovich's optimal transportation problem at its core
as a special case. In the classical case, where $Y$ is scalar, VQR reduces to a
version of the classical QR, and CVQF reduces to the scalar conditional
quantile function. An application to multiple Engel curve estimation is
considered.

found in soccer team ranking by the Union of European Football Associations
(UEFA), is due to implicit game result value or score competition conditions.
The analysis is based on considerations about complex systems, i.e. searching
whether power or other simple law fits are appropriate to describe some
internal dynamics. It is observed that the ranking is specifically organized: a
major class made of a few teams emerges after each game season. Other classes
which apparently have regular sizes subsequently occur. Thus, the notion of
Sheppard primacy index is envisaged to describe the findings. Additional
primacy indices are discussed for enhancing the features. These measures can be
used to sort out peer classes in more general terms. A very simplified toy
model containing ingredients of the UEFA ranking rules suggests that such peer
classes are an extrinsic property of the ranking, as obtained in many nonlinear
systems under boundary condition constraints.

457 based on observations obtained during three separate runs spanning almost
20 years. In total, we found 79 variable stars, of which 66 are new. The BVI
photometry was transformed to the standard system and used to derive cluster
parameters by means of isochrone fitting. Using the complementary H-alpha
photometry carried out in two seasons separated by over 10 years, we find that
the cluster is very rich in Be stars. In total, 15 stars in the observed field
of which 14 are cluster members showed H-alpha in emission either during our
observations or in the past. Most of the Be stars vary in brightness on
different time scales including short-period variability related most likely to
g-mode pulsations. A single-epoch spectrum of NGC457-6 shows that this Be star
is presently in the shell phase. The inventory of variable stars in the
observed field consists of a single BCep-type star, NGC457-8, 13 Be stars, 21
slowly pulsating B stars, seven DSct stars, one GDor star, 16 unclassified
periodic stars, 8 eclipsing systems and a dozen of stars with irregular
variability, of which six are also B-type stars. As many as 45 variable stars
are of spectral type B which is the largest number in all open clusters
presented in this series of papers. The most interesting is the discovery of a
large group of slowly pulsating B stars which occupy the cluster main sequence
in the range between V=11 and 14.5 mag, corresponding to spectral types B3 to
B8. They all have very low amplitudes and about half show pulsations with
frequencies higher than 3 c/d. We argue that these are most likely
fast-rotating slowly pulsating B stars, observed also in other open clusters.

Monte-Carlo methods. For distributions on a continuous state space, one can
find diffusions with the target distribution as equilibrium measure, so that
the state of the diffusion after a long time provides a good sample from the
desired distribution. There exist many diffusions with a common equilibrium,
and one would naturally like to choose those that make the convergence to
equilibrium faster. One way to do this is to consider a reversible diffusion,
and add to it an antisymmetric drift which preserves the invariant measure. It
has been proven that, in general, the irreversible algorithm performs better
than the reversible one, in that the spectral gap is larger. In the present
work, asymptotic variance is used as the criterion to compare these algorithms.
We first provide a general comparison result, and then apply it to the specific
cases of a diffusion on $\mathbb{R}^d$, or on a compact Riemannian manifold. We
prove that, in general, adding an antisymmetric drift to a reversible diffusion
reduces the asymptotic variance. We also provide some extensions of this result
concerning strict inequality, the worst-case analysis, and the behavior of the
asymptotic variance when the drift goes to infinity.

analysis shows that the axis of spicule undergoes quasi-periodic transverse
displacement at different heights from the photosphere. The mean period of
transverse displacement is ~ 175 s and the mean amplitude is 1 arc\,sec. The
oscillation periods are increasing linearly with height which may be counted as
the signature that the spicule is working as a low pass filter and allows only
the low frequencies to propagate towards higher heights. The oscillations
amplitude is increasing with height due to decrease in density. The phase
speeds are increasing until some heights and then decreasing which may be
related to the small scale reconnection at the spicule basis. We conclude that
transversal displacement of spicules axis can be related to the propagation of
kink waves along them. Moreover, we observe signatures of small-scale magnetic
reconnection at the cusp of spicules which may excite kink waves.

backgrounds, based on the formalism used to characterise the polarisation of
the cosmic microwave background. In contrast to standard analyses, this
approach makes no assumptions about the nature of the background and so has the
potential to reveal much more about the physical processes that generated it.
An arbitrary background can be decomposed into modes whose angular dependence
on the sky is given by gradients and curls of spherical harmonics. We derive
the pulsar timing overlap reduction functions for the individual modes, which
are given by simple combinations of spherical harmonics evaluated at the pulsar
locations. We show how these can be used to recover the components of an
arbitrary background, giving explicit results for both isotropic and
anisotropic uncorrelated backgrounds. We also find that the response of a
pulsar timing array to curl modes is identically zero, so half of the
gravitational-wave sky will never be observed using pulsar timing, no matter
how many pulsars are included in the array. An isotropic, unpolarised and
uncorrelated background can be accurately represented using only three modes,
and so a search of this type will be only slightly more complicated than the
standard cross-correlation search using the Hellings and Downs overlap
reduction function. However, by measuring the components of individual modes of
the background and checking for consistency with isotropy, this approach has
the potential to reveal much more information. Each individual mode on its own
describes a background that is correlated between different points on the sky.
A measurement of the components that indicates the presence of correlations in
the background on large angular scales would suggest startling new physics.

constructed based a bunch of labeled data. Recently, due to technological
innovation and automatic data collection schemes, we easily encounter with data
sets containing large amounts of unlabeled samples. Because to label each of
them is usually costly and inefficient, how to utilize these unlabeled data in
a classifier construction process becomes an important problem. In machine
learning literature, active learning or semi-supervised learning are popular
concepts discussed under this situation, where classification algorithms
recruit new unlabeled subjects sequentially based on the information learned
from previous stages of its learning process, and these new subjects are then
labeled and included as new training samples. From a statistical aspect, these
methods can be recognized as a hybrid of the sequential design and stochastic
approximation procedure. In this paper, we study sequential learning procedures
for building efficient and effective classifiers, where only the selected
subjects are labeled and included in its learning stage. The proposed algorithm
combines the ideas of Bayesian sequential optimal design and uncertainty

(175706) 1996 FG3 including new measurements constraining evolution of the
mutual orbit with potential consequences for the entire binary asteroid
population. We also refined previously determined values of parameters of both
components, making 1996 FG3 one of the most well understood binary asteroid
systems. We determined the orbital vector with a substantially greater accuracy
than before and we also placed constraints on a stability of the orbit.
Specifically, the ecliptic longitude and latitude of the orbital pole are
266{\deg} and -83{\deg}, respectively, with the mean radius of the uncertainty
area of 4{\deg}, and the orbital period is 16.1508 +/- 0.0002 h (all quoted
uncertainties correspond to 3sigma). We looked for a quadratic drift of the
mean anomaly of the satellite and obtained a value of 0.04 +/- 0.20 deg/yr^2,
i.e., consistent with zero. The drift is substantially lower than predicted by
the pure binary YORP (BYORP) theory of McMahon and Scheeres (McMahon, J.,
Scheeres, D. [2010]. Icarus 209, 494-509) and it is consistent with the theory
of an equilibrium between BYORP and tidal torques for synchronous binary
asteroids as proposed by Jacobson and Scheeres (Jacobson, S.A., Scheeres, D.
[2011]. ApJ Letters, 736, L19). Based on the assumption of equilibrium, we
derived a ratio of the quality factor and tidal Love number of Q/k = 2.4 x 10^5
uncertain by a factor of five. We also derived a product of the rigidity and
quality factor of mu Q = 1.3 x 10^7 Pa using the theory that assumes an elastic
response of the asteroid material to the tidal forces. This very low value
indicates that the primary of 1996 FG3 is a 'rubble pile', and it also calls
for a re-thinking of the tidal energy dissipation in close asteroid binary
systems.

(\phi_{511 keV} ~ 10^{-3} ph/cm^2/s) in agreement with SPI observation. However
our estimates assumed a negligible number density of electrons in the bulge

Coulomb losses in this configuration). Assuming a number density greater than
$n_e > 10^{-3} cm^{-3}$, we now obtain a flux of 511 keV photons that is
smaller than \phi_{511 keV} ~ 10^{-6} ph/cm^2/s and is essentially in agreement
with the 511 keV flux that one can infer from the total number of positrons
injected by dark matter annihilations into $b \bar{b}$. We thus conclude that

establish a connexion between the two types of signals, even though they are

present solid evidence that the CME was deflected not only in the corona but
also in the interplanetary space. The deflection angle in the interplanetary

in the probability the CME encounters the Earth. A further modeling and
simulation-based analysis suggest that the cause of the deflection in the

conserving GPDs of 3He, H and E, is dominated by the neutron contribution. This
peculiar result makes the 3He target very promising to access the neutron
information. We present here the IA calculation of the spin dependent GPD
tilde-H of 3He. Also for this quantity the neutron contribution is found to be
the dominant one, at low momentum transfer. The known forward limit of the IA
calculation of tilde-H, yielding the polarized parton distributions of 3He, is
correctly recovered. The extraction of the neutron information could be anyway
non trivial, so that a procedure, able to take into account the nuclear effects
encoded in the IA analysis, is proposed. These calculations, essential for the
evaluation of the coherent DVCS cross section asymmetries, which depend on the

observational implications. We model coronal loops as straight cold cylinders
with plasma flow embedded in a static corona. An eigen-value problem governing
propagating sausage waves is formulated, its solutions used to construct
standing modes. Two transverse profiles are distinguished, one being the
generalized Epstein distribution (profile E) and the other (N) proposed
recently in Nakariakov et al.(2012). A parameter study is performed on the
dependence of the maximum period $P_\mathrm{max}$ and cutoff length-to-radius
ratio $(L/a)_{\mathrm{cutoff}}$ in the trapped regime on the density parameters
($\rho_0/\rho_\infty$ and profile steepness $p$) and flow parameters (magnitude
$U_0$ and profile steepness $u$). For either profile, introducing a flow
reduces $P_\mathrm{max}$ relative to the static case. $P_\mathrm{max}$ depends
sensitively on $p$ for profile N but is insensitive to $p$ for profile E. By
far the most important effect a flow introduces is to reduce the capability for
loops to trap standing sausage modes: $(L/a)_{\mathrm{cutoff}}$ may be
substantially reduced in the case with flow relative to the static one. If the
density distribution can be described by profile N, then measuring the sausage
mode period can help deduce the density profile steepness. However, this
practice is not feasible if profile E better describes the density
distribution. Furthermore, even field-aligned flows with magnitudes
substantially smaller than the ambient Alfv\'en speed can make coronal loops
considerably less likely to support trapped standing sausage modes.

the sum distribution is usually intractable and presents an open problem. A
crude Monte Carlo (MC) simulation is the standard technique for the estimation
of this type of probability. However, this approach is computationally
expensive especially when dealing with rare events (i.e events with very small
probabilities). Importance Sampling (IS) is an alternative approach which
effectively improves the computational efficiency of the MC simulation. In this
paper, we develop a general framework based on IS approach for the efficient
estimation of the probability that the sum of independent and not necessarily
identically distributed heavy-tailed RVs exceeds a given threshold. The
proposed IS approach is based on constructing a new sampling distribution by
twisting the hazard rate of the original underlying distribution of each
component in the summation. A minmax approach is carried out for the
determination of the twisting parameter, for any given threshold. Moreover,
using this minmax optimal choice, the estimation of the probability of interest
is shown to be asymptotically optimal as the threshold goes to infinity. We
also offer some selected simulation results illustrating first the efficiency
of the proposed IS approach compared to the naive MC simulation. The
near-optimality of the minmax approach is then numerically analyzed.

determine the geographical distribution of voltages at the nodes. Adjusting the

power flow through the transmission lines. Next, we study the response of the

calculate the resulting change in the power flow distribution. This change is
found to decay slowly in space, with a power of the distance from the
additional line. We find the geographical distribution of the power
transmission, when a link is added. With a finite probability the maximal load
in the grid becomes larger when a transmission line is added, a phenomenon that
is known as Braess' paradox. We find that this phenomenon is more pronounced in
a DC grid described by the nonlinear equations derived from Kirchhoff's law
than in a linearised flow model studied previously in Ref. \cite{witthaut2013}.
We observe furthermore that the increase in the load of the transmission lines
due to an added line is of the same order of magnitude as Joule heating.
Interestingly, for a fixed system size the load of the lines increases with the
degree of disorder in the geographical distribution of consumers and producers.

variable methods is used to derive an analytical solution of the

Assuming an ideal permselective medium allows for the analytic calculation of
the 3D concentration and electric potential distributions as well as a
current-voltage relation. It is shown that any asymmetry in the microchamber
geometries will result in current rectification. Moreover, it is demonstrated
that for non-negligible microchamber resistances the conductance does not

continuous decrease. The results are intended to facilitate a more direct
comparison between theory and experiments as now the voltage drop is across a

poses a difficult problem due to the lack of a closed form expression for the
likelihood. From a Bayesian computational perspective it can be casted as a
missing data problem where the diffusion bridges in between discrete-time
observations are missing. The computational problem can then be dealt with
using a Markov-chain Monte-Carlo method known as data-augmentation. If unknown
parameters appear in the diffusion coefficient, direct implementation of
data-augmentation results in a Markov chain that is reducible. Furthermore,
data-augmentation requires efficient sampling of diffusion bridges, which can
be difficult, especially in the multidimensional case.
  We present a general framework to deal with with these problems that does not
rely on discretisation. The construction generalises previous approaches and
sheds light on the assumptions necessary to make these approaches work. We
define a random-walk type Metropolis-Hastings sampler for updating diffusion
bridges. Our methods are illustrated using guided proposals for sampling
diffusion bridges. These are Markov processes obtained by adding a guiding term
to the drift of the diffusion. We give general guidelines on the construction
of these proposals and introduce a time change and scaling of the guided
proposal that reduces discretisation error. Numerical examples demonstrate the
performance of our methods.

Gaussian energy disorder famously explains the origin of non-Arrhenius
$\exp[-\sigma^2/(k_BT^2)]$ temperature-dependence in disordered systems. Here
we show that unbiased diffusion remains asymptotically normal also in the
presence of spatial correlations decaying to zero. However, due to a temporal
lack of self-averaging transient subdiffusion emerges on mesoscale, and it can
readily reach macroscale even for moderately strong disorder fluctuations of
$\sigma\sim 4-5\, k_BT$. Due to its nonergodic origin such subdiffusion
exhibits a large scatter in single trajectory averages. However, at odds with
intuition, it occurs essentially faster than one expects from the normal
diffusion in the absence of correlations. We apply these results to diffusion
of regulatory proteins on DNA molecules and predict that such diffusion should
be anomalous, but much faster than earlier expected on a typical length of
genes for a realistic energy disorder of several room $k_BT$, or merely
$0.05-0.075$ eV.

indefinite descriptions or quantified noun phrases, is often as- sumed to be a
fully solved question: common nouns are properties, and determiners are
generalised quantifiers that apply to two predicates: the property
corresponding to the common noun and the one corresponding to the verb phrase.
We first present a criticism of this standard view. Firstly, the semantics of
determiners does not follow the syntactical structure of the sentence. Secondly
the standard interpretation of the indefinite article cannot ac- count for
nominal sentences. Thirdly, the standard view misses the linguis- tic asymmetry
between the two properties of a generalised quantifier. In the sequel, we
propose a treatment of determiners and quantifiers as Hilbert terms in a richly
typed system that we initially developed for lexical semantics, using a many
sorted logic for semantical representations. We present this semantical
framework called the Montagovian generative lexicon and show how these terms
better match the syntactical structure and avoid the aforementioned problems of
the standard approach. Hilbert terms rather differ from choice functions in
that there is one polymorphic operator and not one operator per formula. They
also open an intriguing connection between the logic for meaning assembly, the
typed lambda calculus handling compositionality and the many-sorted logic for
semantical representations. Furthermore epsilon terms naturally introduce
type-judgements and confirm the claim that type judgment are a form of
presupposition.

Boolean equations in several variables with co-efficients in the two element
Boolean algebra $B_{0}=\{0,1\}$ and find all satisfying assignments. The
algorithm is based on the application of a well known generalized Boole-Shannon
orthonormal (ON) expansion of Boolean functions. A necessary and sufficient
consistency condition for a special class of functions was developed in
\cite{sule} using such an expansion. Paper \cite{sule} develops a condition for
consistency of the equation $f(X)=0$ for the special classes of Boolean
functions 1) $f$ in $B(\Phi(X))$ for an ON set $\Phi$ of Boolean functions in
$X$ over a general Boolean algebra $B$ and 2) $f$ in $B(X_{2})(\Phi(X_{1}))$.
The present paper addresses the problem of obtaining the consistency conditions
for arbitrary Boolean functions in $B_{0}(X)$. Next, the consistency for a
single equation is shown equivalent to another system of Boolean equations
which involves the ON functions and characterizes all solutions. This result is
then extended for Boolean systems in several variables over the algebra
$B_{0}=\{0,1\}$ which does not convert the system into a single equation. This
condition leads to the algorithm for computing all solutions of the Boolean
system without using analogous resolution and determine satisfiability. For
special systems defined by CNF formulas this algorithm results into an
extension of the DPLL algorithm in which the \emph{splitting rule} is
generalized to several variables in terms of ON terms in the sense that
splitting of CNF set in a single variable $x$ is equivalent to ON terms $x,x'$.

show stochastic, broadband, pulse-shape variations intrinsic to the pulsar

observations; understanding the properties of this noise is of particular
importance for the effort to detect gravitational waves with pulsar timing
arrays. We assess the short-term profile and timing stability of 22 millisecond
pulsars that are part of the Parkes Pulsar Timing Array sample by examining
intra-observation arrival time variability and single-pulse phenomenology. In 7
of the 22 pulsars, in the band centred at approximately 1400MHz, we find that
the brightest observations are limited by intrinsic jitter. We find consistent
results, either detections or upper limits, for jitter noise in other frequency
bands. PSR J1909-3744 shows the lowest levels of jitter noise, which we
estimate to contribute $\sim$10 ns root mean square error to the arrival times
for hour-duration observations. Larger levels of jitter noise are found in
pulsars with wider pulses and distributions of pulse intensities. The jitter
noise in PSR J0437-4715 decorrelates over a bandwidth of $\sim$2 GHz. We show
that the uncertainties associated with timing pulsar models can be improved by
including physically motivated jitter uncertainties. Pulse-shape variations
will limit the timing precision at future, more sensitive, telescopes; it is
imperative to account for this noise when designing instrumentation and timing

we compute the feature maps from the entire image only once, and then pool
features in arbitrary regions (sub-images) to generate fixed-length

of bound 5-HT, the endogenous agonist that ac-tivates the receptor and triggers
downstream signaling, suggesting that IL2 rigid-body motions can display
distinct behaviors that may discriminate functional mechanism of GPCRs.

time-reversal-symmetry breaking on the electronic states in the vicinity of the
Dirac point. In agreement with experiments, we find evidence that the Mn ion is
in the ${+2}$-valence state and introduces an acceptor in the bulk band gap.
The Mn-acceptor has predominantly $p$-character, and is localized mainly around
the Mn impurity and its nearest-neighbor Se atoms. Its electronic structure and
spin-polarization are determined by the hybridization between the Mn $d$-levels
and the $p$-levels of surrounding Se atoms, which is strongly affected by
electronic correlations at the Mn site. The opening of the gap at the Dirac
point depends crucially on the quasi-resonant coupling and the strong
real-space overlap between the spin-chiral surface states and the mid-gap
spin-polarized Mn-acceptor states.

physical-layer network coding (PLNC) with multiuser detection (MUD). PLNC and
MUD are applied jointly at the physical level in order to extract any linear
combination of messages experiencing a collision. The set of combinations
extracted from a whole frame is then processed by the receiver to recover the
original packets. A simple pre-coding stage at the transmitting terminals
allows the receiver to further increase system diversity. We derive an
analytical bound on the system throughput and present simulation results for
the decoding at the physical level as well as several performance measures at

energy efficiency. The results we present are promising and suggest that a
cross layer approach leveraging on the joint use of PLNC and MUD can
significantly improve the performance of RA systems.

  77-102",,,"physics.hist-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  I discuss three connections between Dummett's writings about time and
philosophical aspects of physics.
  The first connection (Section 2) arises from remarks of Dummett's about the
different relations of observation to time and to space. The main point is
uncontroversial and applies equally to classical and quantum physics. It
concerns the fact that perceptual processing is so rapid, compared with the
typical time-scale on which macroscopic objects change their observable
properties, that it engenders the idea of a 'common now', spread across space.
  The other two connections are specific to quantum theory, as interpreted
along the lines of Everett. So for these two connections, the physics side is
controversial, just as the philosophical side is.
  In Section 3, I connect the subjective uncertainty before an Everettian
'splitting' of the multiverse to Dummett's suggestion, inspired by McTaggart,
that a complete, i.e. indexical-free description of a temporal reality is
impossible. And in Section 4, I connect Barbour's denial that time is real---a
denial along the lines of Everett, rather than McTaggart---to Dummett's
suggestion that statements about the past are not determinately true or false,
because they are not effectively decidable.

consequence of the existence of a larger number of models with a high

Our investigation is based on a systematic parameter study of weakly stratified

M$_{\odot}$). High-resolution radio detections of MBHs are rare. Here we
present sensitive, contemporaneous Chandra X-ray, and very long baseline
interferometry (VLBI) radio observations with the European VLBI Network (EVN).
The source is detected in the X-rays, and shows no long-term variability. If
the hard X-ray source is powered by accretion, the apparent low accretion
efficiency would be consistent with a black hole in the hard state. Hard state
black holes are known to show radio emission compact on the milliarcsecond
scales. However, the central region of NGC 404 is resolved out on 10
milliarcsecond (0.15-1.5 pc) scales. Our VLBI non-detection of a compact,
partially self-absorbed radio core in NGC 404 implies that either the black
hole mass is smaller than $3^{+5}_{-2}\times10^5$ M$_{\odot}$, or the source
does not follow the fundamental plane of black hole activity relation. An
alternative explanation is that the central black hole is not in the hard
state. The radio emission observed on arcsecond (tens of pc) scales may
originate in nuclear star formation or extended emission due to AGN activity,
although the latter would not be typical considering the structural properties
of low-ionization nuclear emission-line region galaxies (LINERs) with confirmed
nuclear activity.

difficult or impossible to achieve in other effective spin systems, such as
long-ranged spin-spin interactions with controllable degrees of spatial and
spin anisotropy and favorable energy scales. Realizing quantum magnetism with
ultracold molecules provides access to rich many-body behaviors, including many
exotic phases of matter and interesting excitations and dynamics.
Far-from-equilibrium dynamics plays a key role in our exposition, just as it
did in recent ultracold molecule experiments realizing effective quantum
magnetism. In particular, we show that dynamical probes allow the observation
of correlated many-body spin physics, even in polar molecule gases that are not
quantum degenerate. After describing how quantum magnetism arises in ultracold
molecules and discussing recent observations of quantum magnetism with polar
molecules, we survey prospects for the future, ranging from immediate goals to
long-term visions.

are also found. Interestingly, in almost all the geometries studied in this
work, the metric associated with the second dreibein turns out to be
equivalent, up to a constant global factor, to the first one. This phenomenon
has been previously observed in other bigravity theories in asymptotically flat
and asymptotically Anti-de Sitter backgrounds. However, for the particular case
of the $z=3$ Lifshitz black hole, here we found that the second metric

number of periodic variable stars in a region of the H-R diagram where no
pulsation is expected. This region lies between the instability strips of the
delta Scuti and SPB stars. Moreover the periods of the new phenomenon,
P~0.1-0.7 d, do not allow to associate it a priori to either of these two types
of pulsations. Stars in the NGC 3766 cluster are known as fast rotators with
rotational velocities typically larger than half of their critical velocity.
Rotation can affect both the geometrical properties and period domain of
pulsations. It also alters the apparent stellar luminosity through gravity
darkening, effect seldom taken considered in theoretical studies of the
rotation-pulsation interaction. We explore if both of these effects are able to
deliver a consistent interpretation for the observed properties of the ""new
variables"" in NGC 3766: explaining their presence outside the known instability
strips and their variability periods. We carry out an instability analysis of
SPB models within the framework of the Traditional Approximation of Rotation
and study the visibility of modes according to the angle of view and rotation.
We also check how gravity darkening affects the effective temperature and
luminosity of stellar models for different angles of view and rotation
velocities. At the red (cold) border of the instability strip, prograde
sectoral modes are preferentially excited and their visibilities are maximum
when seen equator-on. Furthermore low-mass SPB models seen equator-on can
appear in the gap between non-rotating SPB and delta Scuti stars due to gravity
darkening. In that case, periods of these most visible modes are shifted to the
0.2-0.5 d range due to the effects of the Coriolis force. We hence suggest that
the new variable stars observed in NGC 3766 are actually fast rotating SPB
pulsators.

field, with a modest contribution from quasi-thermal gamma rays whose spectrum
was calculated in Paper I. We focus on the case of extreme baryon depletion in
the magnetized material, but allow for a separate baryonic component that is
entrained from a confining medium. Dissipation is driven by relativistic motion
between these two components, which develops once the photon compactness drops
below $ 4\times 10^3(Y_e/0.5)^{-1}$. We first calculate the acceleration of the
magnetized component following breakout, showing that embedded MHD turbulence
provides significant inertia, the neglect of which leads to unrealistically
high estimates of flow Lorentz factor. After re-heating begins, the pair and
photon distributions are evolved self-consistently using a one-zone kinetic
code that incorporates an exact treatment of Compton scattering, pair
production and annihilation, and Coulomb scattering. Heating leads to a surge
in pair creation, and the scattering depth saturates at $\tau_{\rm T} \sim$
1-4. The plasma maintains a very low ratio of particle to magnetic pressure,
and can support strong anisotropy in the charged particle distribution, with
cooling dominated by Compton scattering. High-energy power-law spectra with
photon indices in the range observed in GRBs ($-3 < \beta < -3/2$) are obtained
by varying the ratio of heat input to the seed energy in quasi-thermal photons.

arise in a number of applications, ranging from analysis of gene expression

  In the unconstrained case, the estimation performances of PCA has been
precisely characterized using random matrix theory, under a statistical model
known as the `spiked model.' It is known that the estimation error undergoes a
phase transition as the signal-to-noise ratio crosses a certain threshold.
Unfortunately, tools from random matrix theory have no bearing on the

  ""Absolute Arithmetic and $\mathbb{F}_1$-Geometry"" (ed. K. Thas)",,,,"math.GR math.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Starting from an ancient observation of Tits concerning the interpretation of
symmetric groups as Chevalley groups over a (non-existing) field having only
one element, we describe combinatorial geometry over this field, as well as
Linear Algebra. We arrive at an ""absolute mantra"" which is one of the basic
principles of the present book.

twenty microns, are electrically charged while proton beam irradiating. These
bodies are accelerated by the running pulse field in a spiral waveguide up to
velocity: thirty kilometers per second. The accelerator, generating
micrometeorites is placed at satellites on the Earth orbit. This article
considers processes of penetration of micrometeorites into the Earth
atmosphere. It is shown that micrometeorites evaporate at the height of one
hundred kilometers-one hundred fifty kilometers from the surface of the Earth.
A micrometeorite which is a segment of the beryllium tube equipped with a
graphite cone in the head part is the very meteorite to reach the Earth surface
without being broken.
