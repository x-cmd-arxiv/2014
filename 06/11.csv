curves of four Galactic classical Cepheids and investigate their impact as a
systematic uncertainty for Baade-Wesselink distances. Highly precise Doppler
measurements were obtained using the Coralie high-resolution spectrograph since
2011. Particular care was taken to sample all phase points in order to very
accurately trace the RV curve during multiple epochs and to search for
differences in linear radius variations derived from observations obtained at
different epochs. Different timescales are sampled, ranging from cycle-to-cycle
to months and years. The unprecedented combination of excellent phase coverage
obtained during multiple epochs and high precision enabled the discovery of
significant modulation in the RV curves of the short-period s-Cepheids QZ
Normae and V335 Puppis, as well as the long-period fundamental mode Cepheids l
Carinae and RS Puppis. The modulations manifest as shape and amplitude
variations that vary smoothly on timescales of years for short-period Cepheids
and from one pulsation cycle to the next in the long-period Cepheids. The order
of magnitude of the effect ranges from several hundred m/s to a few km/s. The
resulting difference among linear radius variations derived using data from
different epochs can lead to systematic errors of up to 15% for
Baade-Wesselink-type distances, if the employed angular and linear radius
variations are not determined contemporaneously. The different natures of the
Cepheids exhibiting modulation in their RV curves suggests that this phenomenon
is common. The observational baseline is not yet sufficient to conclude whether
these modulations are periodic. To ensure the accuracy of Baade-Wesselink
distances, angular and linear radius variations should always be determined
contemporaneously.

lower than expected for a star of this age and mass. This value proves an
unusual lack of activity for a star with estimated age around 600 Myr. We argue

  We present a novel, visually intuitive approach to partitioning two input
sorted arrays into pairs of contiguous sequences of elements, one from each
array, such that 1) each pair comprises any desired total number of elements,
and 2) the elements of each pair form a contiguous sequence in the output
merged sorted array. While the resulting partition and the computational
complexity are similar to those of certain previous algorithms, our approach is
different, extremely intuitive, and offers interesting insights. Based on this,
we present a synchronization-free, cache-efficient merging (and sorting)
algorithm.
  While we use a shared memory architecture as the basis, our algorithm is
easily adaptable to additional architectures. In fact, our approach is even
relevant to cache-efficient sequential sorting. The algorithms are presented,
along with important cache-related insights.

candidate cosmic-ray accelerators. GRBs, including low-luminosity GRBs, can be
efficient PeV neutrino emitters for low bulk Lorentz factor outflows, although
the photopion production efficiency needs to be tuned to simultaneously explain
ultra-high-energy cosmic rays. Photopion production efficiency of cosmic-rays
accelerated in the inner jets of flat spectrum radio quasars (FSRQs) is ~1-10%
due to interactions with photons of the broad-line region (BLR), whereas BL Lac
objects are not effective PeV neutrino sources due to the lack of external
radiation fields. Photopion threshold effects with BLR photons suppress
neutrino production below ~1 PeV, which imply that neutrinos from other sources
would dominate over the diffuse neutrino intensity at sub-PeV energies.
Reduction of the >> PeV neutrino flux can be expected when curving cosmic-ray
proton distributions are employed. Considering a log-parabolic function to
describe the cosmic-ray distribution, we discuss possible implications for
particle acceleration in black-hole jets. Our results encourage a search for

  approach without reversibility",,,,,"math.PR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We study the hitting times of Markov processes to target set $G$, starting
from a reference configuration $x_0$ or its basin of attraction. The
configuration $x_0$ can correspond to the bottom of a (meta)stable well, while
the target $G$ could be either a set of saddle (exit) points of the well, or a
set of further (meta)stable configurations. Three types of results are
reported: (1) A general theory is developed, based on the path-wise approach to
metastability, which has three important attributes. First, it is general in
that it does not assume reversibility of the process, does not focus only on
hitting times to rare events and does not assume a particular starting measure.
Second, it relies only on the natural hypothesis that the mean hitting time to
$G$ is asymptotically longer than the mean recurrence time to $x_0$ or $G$.
Third, despite its mathematical simplicity, the approach yields precise and
explicit bounds on the corrections to exponentiality. (2) We compare and relate
different metastability conditions proposed in the literature so to eliminate
potential sources of confusion. This is specially relevant for evolutions of
infinite-volume systems, whose treatment depends on whether and how relevant
parameters (temperature, fields) are adjusted. (3) We introduce the notion of
early asymptotic exponential behavior to control time scales asymptotically
smaller than the mean-time scale. This control is particularly relevant for
systems with unbounded state space where nucleations leading to exit from
metastability can happen anywhere in the volume. We provide natural sufficient
conditions on recurrence times for this early exponentiality to hold and show
that it leads to estimations of probability density functions.

efficient technologies for producing high quality graphene for large areas.
Nevertheless, still high pressures and big quantities of precursor gas are
currently required. The objective of this work is to deposit graphene using the
monolayer-formation-time concept (t) from the kinetic theory of gases, which
leads to an economization of the precursor gas, a minimization of the process
pressure and the time needed to grow a graphene monolayer. Our process has been
designed taking into account the dependence of t on the pressure, the mass
particle of the gas, the sticking coefficient, and the growth temperature.
Thus, with this alternative method, based on CVD but using very-low pressure
instant pulses of precursor gas (~10^-4 Pa), we have reduced the deposition
time to the order of 10 s. We carried out the processes at temperatures below
1000 Grad Celsius with methane (CH4) as a precursor gas under High Vacuum (HV)

the first time. It is shown that the experimental data portray a first-order
phase transition from a superfluid to an ideal gas of non-interacting
quasiparticles. Even-even, odd-$A$, and odd-odd level densities show in detail
the behavior of gap- and gapless superconductors also observed in solid-state
physics. These results and analysis should find a direct application to
mesoscopic systems such as superconducting clusters.

black phosphorus, have raised exciting prospects of an outstanding
two-dimensional (2D) material that exhibits excellent properties for nanodevice
applications. Here we study by first-principles calculations the adsorption of
CO, CO2, NH3, NO and NO2 gas molecules on a mono-layer phosphorene. Our results
predict superior sensing performance of phosphorene that rivals or even
surpasses other 2D materials such as graphene and MoS2. We determine the
optimal adsorption positions of these molecules on the phosphorene and identify
molecular doping, i.e., charge transfer between the molecules and phosphorene,
as the driving mechanism for the high adsorption strength. We further
calculated the current-voltage (I-V) relation using a non-equilibrium Greens
function (NEGF) formalism. The transport features show large (one to two orders
of magnitude) anisotropy along different (armchair or zigzag) directions, which
is consistent with the anisotropic electronic band structure of phosphorene.
Remarkably, the I-V relation exhibits distinct responses with a marked change
of the I-V relation along either the armchair or the zigzag directions
depending on the type of molecules. Such selectivity and sensitivity to
adsorption makes phosphorene a superior gas sensor that promises wide-ranging
applications.

simplified setup, galactic outflows driven by a momentum input rate of order
L_Edd/c can establish an M_BH - sigma relation with slope and normalisation
similar to that observed. We show that momentum input at a rate of L_Edd/c is
however insufficient to drive efficient outflows once cooling and gas inflows

account. We argue that observed large-scale AGN-driven outflows are instead
likely to be energy-driven and show that such outflows can reach momentum
fluxes exceeding 10 L_Edd/c within the innermost 10 kpc of the galaxy. The
outflows are highly anisotropic, with outflow rates and a velocity structure
found to be inadequately described by spherical outflow models. We verify that
the hot energy-driven outflowing gas is expected to be strongly affected by

to discover bubbles missed by previous searches -- particularly bubbles near
bright sources which have low contrast relative to their surroundings. Brut
demonstrates the synergies that exist between citizen scientists, professional

citizens can identify patterns that machines cannot detect without training,
machine learning algorithms like Brut can use the output of citizen science

""fundamental plane"" scaling relation between size, mean surface brightness and
velocity dispersion, with the form $R \propto \sigma^{a}\mu^{b}$. This relation
not only has very small (<0.05 dex) intrinsic scatter, but also has
significantly different coefficients from the expected virial scaling (a
""tilt""). We analyze hundreds of simulations of elliptical galaxies formed from
mergers of spiral galaxies in groups to determine if the fundamental plane can
emerge from multiple, mostly minor and hierarchical collisionless mergers. We
find that these simulated ellipticals lie on a similar fundamental plane with
$a \approx 1.7$ and $b \approx 0.3$. The scatter about this plane is not larger
than observed, while the tilt is in the correct sense, although $a$ is larger
than for typical observations. This supports the idea that collisionless
mergers can contribute significantly to the tilt of the fundamental plane. The
tilt is mainly driven by a mass-dependent dark matter fraction, such that more
massive galaxies have larger dark matter fractions within $R_{e}$. We further
discuss the origin of this mass-dependent dark matter fraction and its
compatibility with strong lensing observations, as well as the links between
the fundamental plane, dynamical masses and the virial theorem.

from the recently proposed Grand Tack model, which couples the gas-driven
migration of giant planets to the accretion of the terrestrial planets. The
giant impact phase follows the oligarchic growth phase, which builds a bi-modal
mass distribution within the disc of embryos and planetesimals. By varying the
ratio of the total mass in the embryo population to the total mass in the
planetesimal population and the mass of the individual embryos, we explore how
different disc conditions control the final planets. The total mass ratio of
embryos to planetesimals controls the timing of the last giant (Moon forming)
impact and its violence. The initial embryo mass sets the size of the lunar
impactor and the growth rate of Mars. After comparing our simulated outcomes
with the actual orbits of the terrestrial planets (angular momentum deficit,
mass concentration) and taking into account independent geochemical constraints
on the mass accreted by the Earth after the Moon forming event and on the
timescale for the growth of Mars, we conclude that the protoplanetary disc at
the beginning of the giant impact phase must have had most of its mass in
Mars-sized embryos and only a small fraction of the total disc mass in the
planetesimal population. From this, we infer that the Moon forming event
occurred between $\sim$60 and $\sim$130 My after the formation of the first

robust new phenomenon -- dynamic critical trapping -- in which the system is
self-trapped near the critical point due to efficient absorption of field
kinetic energy by heating the quantum spins. We quantify limits in which this
phenomenon can be observed and generalize these results by developing a
Kibble-Zurek scaling theory that incorporates the dynamic field. Our findings
can potentially be interesting in the context of early universe physics, where
the role of the driving field is played by the inflaton or a modulus.

distribution in the Galaxy and the gamma-ray emission parameters by considering
radio and gamma-ray observational constraints. By simulating a large number of

1-sigma upper limit. The emission from unresolved MSPs at 2 GeV, where the peak

this strong-coupling multi-band perspective are 1) that the symmetry hierarchy

symmetry-breaking patterns compete with energy differences within a few meV per

the covariance matrix of the 3D matter density power spectrum for the
concordance $\Lambda$CDM cosmology from an ensemble of N-body simulations of
the Dark Energy Universe Simulation - Parallel Universe Runs (DEUS-PUR). This
consists of 12288 realisations of a $(656\,h^{-1}\,\textrm{Mpc})^3$ simulation
box with $256^3$ particles. We combine this set with an auxiliary sample of 96
simulations of the same volume with $1024^3$ particles. We find N-body mass
resolution effect to be an important source of systematic errors on the
covariance at high redshift and small intermediate scales. We correct for this
effect by introducing an empirical statistical method which provide an accurate
determination of the covariance matrix over a wide range of scales including
the Baryon Oscillations interval. Contrary to previous studies that used
smaller N-body ensembles, we find the power spectrum distribution to
significantly deviate from expectations of a Gaussian random density field at
$k\gtrsim 0.25\,h\,\textrm{Mpc}^{-1}$ and $z<0.5$. This suggests that in the
case of finite volume surveys an unbiased estimate of the ensemble averaged

of compact white dwarf (WD) binaries. Not only do tides affect the pre-merger
state (such as temperature and rotation rate) of the WDs, but they may also
determine which systems merge and which undergo stable mass transfer. In this
paper, we attempt to quantify the effects of rotation on tidal angular momentum
transport in binary stars, with specific calculations applied to WD stellar
models. We incorporate the effect of rotation using the traditional
approximation, in which the dynamically excited gravity waves within the WDs
are transformed into gravito-inertial Hough waves. The Coriolis force has only
a minor effect on prograde gravity waves, and previous results predicting the
tidal spin-up and heating of inspiraling WDs are not significantly modified.
However, rotation strongly alters retrograde gravity waves and inertial waves,
with important consequences for the tidal spin-down of accreting WDs. We
identify new dynamical tidal forcing terms that arise from a proper separation
of the equilibrium and dynamical tide components; these new forcing terms are
very important for systems near synchronous rotation. Additionally, we discuss
the impact of Stokes drift currents on the wave angular momentum flux. Finally,
we speculate on how tidal interactions will affect super-synchronously rotating
WDs in accreting systems.

cosmic evolution. This is global history greatly extended, big history with a

this formalism to the Kardar Parisi Zhang (KPZ) equation, and introduce the

inserting a representation of the unit operator into the path integral which

a random extended network with multi-antenna base stations (BSs), where the
number of antennas per BS is allowed to scale as a function of the network
size. The antenna scaling is justified by the current trend towards the use of
higher carrier frequencies, which allows to pack large number of antennas in
small form factors. The main goal is to study the per-BS antenna requirement
that ensures scalability of this network, i.e., its ability to deliver
non-vanishing rate to each source-destination pair. We first derive an
information theoretic upper bound on the capacity of this network under a
general propagation model, which provides a lower bound on the per-BS antenna
requirement. Then, we characterize the scalability requirements for two
competing strategies of interest: (i) long hop: each source-destination pair
minimizes the number of hops by sacrificing multiplexing gain while achieving
full beamforming (power) gain over each hop, and (ii) short hop: each
source-destination pair communicates through a series of short hops, each
achieving full multiplexing gain. While long hop may seem more intuitive in the
context of massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) transmission, we show
that the short hop strategy is significantly more efficient in terms of per-BS
antenna requirement for throughput scalability. As a part of the proof, we
construct a scalable short hop strategy and show that it does not violate any
fundamental limits on the spatial degrees of freedom (DoFs).

which undergo transitions into the absorbing state and which are described by a
Master equation. These models include predator prey models, and directed

systems with external noise it is always possible to construct an MSR action.
  Using a path integral representation for the generator of the correlation
functions, we show how, by introducing a composite auxiliary field, one can
generate an auxiliary field loop expansion for the effective action for both
types of systems. As a specific example of the Doi-Peliti formalism we
determine the effective action for the chemical reaction annihilation and
diffusion process $A+A \rightarrow 0$. For the external noise problem we
evaluate the effective action for the Cole-Hopf form of the Kardar-Parisi Zhang

$-$18.21 mag and a half-light radius (R$_{e}$) of 559 pc. Interestingly, it
possesses a faint outer stellar component, which extends up to 10 kpc from its
centre and has a nearly constant $r$-band surface brightness of $\sim$26
mag/arcsec$^{2}$. ESO-VLT long-slit spectroscopic data reveal that the simple
stellar population (SSP) properties are fairly similar to those of previously

engineering technique for phase-matched resonant four-wave mixing (FWM). We
demonstrate a dual-cavity resonant structure that employs coupling-induced
frequency splitting at one of three resonances to compensate for cavity
dispersion, enabling phase-matching. Coupling strength is controlled by thermal
tuning of one cavity enabling active control of the resonant
frequency-matching. In a fabricated silicon microresonator, we show an 8 dB
enhancement of seeded FWM efficiency over the non-compensated state. The
measured four-wave mixing has a peak wavelength conversion efficiency of -37.9
dB across a free spectral range (FSR) of 3.334 THz ($\sim$27 nm). Enabled by
strong counteraction of dispersion, this FSR is, to our knowledge, the largest
in silicon to demonstrate FWM to date. This form of mode-coupling-based, active
dispersion compensation can be beneficial for many FWM-based devices including
wavelength converters, parametric amplifiers, and widely detuned correlated
photon-pair sources. Apart from compensating intrinsic dispersion, the proposed
mechanism can alternatively be utilized in an otherwise dispersionless
resonator to counteract the detuning effect of self- and cross-phase modulation
on the pump resonance during FWM, thereby addressing a fundamental issue in the
performance of light sources such as broadband optical frequency combs.

performing inference remains a major challenge. Helmholtz machines and deep
belief networks are such models, and the wake-sleep algorithm has been proposed
to train them. The wake-sleep algorithm relies on training not just the
directed generative model but also a conditional generative model (the
inference network) that runs backward from visible to latent, estimating the
posterior distribution of latent given visible. We propose a novel
interpretation of the wake-sleep algorithm which suggests that better
estimators of the gradient can be obtained by sampling latent variables
multiple times from the inference network. This view is based on importance
sampling as an estimator of the likelihood, with the approximate inference
network as a proposal distribution. This interpretation is confirmed
experimentally, showing that better likelihood can be achieved with this
reweighted wake-sleep procedure. Based on this interpretation, we propose that
a sigmoidal belief network is not sufficiently powerful for the layers of the
inference network in order to recover a good estimator of the posterior
distribution of latent variables. Our experiments show that using a more
powerful layer model, such as NADE, yields substantially better generative
models.

which is helpful for further research. Since there is a close relationship
between microwave brightness temperature data and some related properties of
the lunar regolith, such as the thickness, temperature and dielectric constant,
so precise and high resolution brightness temperature is necessary for such

this paper is to solve the problem in performing deconvolution of the lunar

pulsar paradigms and central to polar cap models of gamma-ray pulsars for over
three decades. The Fermi gamma-ray pulsar population now exceeds 140 sources
and has defined an important part of Fermi's science legacy. Among the
population characteristics well established is the common occurrence of
exponential turnovers in their spectra in the 1--10 GeV range. These turnovers
are too gradual to arise from magnetic pair creation in the strong magnetic
fields of pulsar inner magnetospheres. By demanding insignificant photon
attenuation precipitated by such single-photon pair creation, the energies of
these turnovers for Fermi pulsars can be used to compute lower bounds for the
typical altitude of GeV band emission. This paper explores such pair
transparency constraints below the turnover energy, and updates earlier
altitude bound determinations of that have been deployed in various Fermi
pulsar papers. For low altitude emission locales, general relativistic
influences are found to be important. Rotational aberration influences are also
explored, and are found to be small at low altitudes, except near the magnetic
pole. The altitude bounds are typically in the range of 2-7 stellar radii for
the young Fermi pulsar population, and provide key information on the emission
altitude in radio quiet pulsars that do not possess double-peaked pulse
profiles. The bound for the Crab pulsar is at a much higher altitude, with the
putative detection by MAGIC out to 350-400 GeV implying a lower bound of 310km
to the emission region, i.e., approximately 20% of the light cylinder radius.
These results are also extended to the super-critical field domain, where it is
found that emission in magnetars originating below around 10 stellar radii will
not appear in the Fermi-LAT band.

second-order stochastic processes driven by position-dependent forces and

forces and fluxes in such a limit follow a linear phenomenonical relation and
the associated scalar coefficients always satisfy the reciprocal relation for
both transient and steady states. The scalar coefficient is proportional to the
square of local temperature divided by the local frictional coefficient and
originated from the second moment of velocity distribution along each
dimension. This result suggests the very close connection between Soret effect
(thermal diffusion) and Dufour effect at nano scale even far from equilibrium.

between jet power, X-ray luminosity, and black hole mass. Under the assumption
that a Blandford-Znajek-type mechanism, which relies on black hole spin,
contributes non-negligibly to jet production, the sufficiently small scatter in
the fundamental plane shows that black hole spin differences of
$\mid$$\Delta$a$\mid \sim$1 are not typical among the active galactic nuclei
population. If $-$ as it seems $-$ radio loud and radio quiet objects are both
faithful to the fundamental plane, models of black hole accretion in which the
radio loud/radio quiet dichotomy is based on a spin dichotomy of
a$\sim$1/a$\sim$0, respectively, are difficult to reconcile with the
observations.
  We show how recent theoretical work based on differences in accretion flow
orientation between retrograde and prograde, accommodates a small scatter in
the fundamental plane for objects that do have non-negligible differences in
black hole spin values. We also show that the dichotomy in spin between the
most radio loud and the most radio quiet involves $\mid$$\Delta$a$\mid

with the fundamental plane, also allows one to interpret other otherwise
puzzling observations of jets across the mass scale including 1) the recently
observed inverse relation between radio and X-rays at higher Eddington ratios
in both black hole X-ray binaries as well as active galactic nuclei and 2) the

widely used to provide two ways audio transfer feature. The solution here is to
provide inter-working between the two protocols which they have different media
transports, audio codecs, header formats and different transport protocols for
the audio transmission. This translation will help bridging the gap between the
two protocols by providing inter-working capability between the two audio
streams of IAX and RSW. Some related works have been done to provide
translation between IAX and RSW control signalling messages. But, this research
paper concentrates on the translation that depends on the media transfer. The
proposed translation module was tested and evaluated in different scenarios in

implement multiple-rate codes~(referred to as {\em HT-coset codes}), where the
code length $N=2^p$ is fixed but the code dimension $K$ can be varied from $1$
to $N-1$ by adjusting the set of frozen bits. The HT-coset codes, including
Reed-Muller~(RM) codes and polar codes as typical examples, can share a pair of
encoder and decoder with implementation complexity of order $O(N \log N)$.
However, to guarantee that all codes with designated rates perform well,
HT-coset coding usually requires a sufficiently large code length, which in
turn causes difficulties in the determination of which bits are better for
being frozen. In this paper, we propose to transmit short HT-coset codes in the
so-called block Markov superposition transmission~(BMST) manner. At the
transmitter, signals are spatially coupled via superposition, resulting in long
codes. At the receiver, these coupled signals are recovered by a sliding-window
iterative soft successive cancellation decoding algorithm. Most importantly,
the performance around or below the bit-error-rate~(BER) of $10^{-5}$ can be
predicted by a simple genie-aided lower bound. Both these bounds and simulation
results show that the BMST of short HT-coset codes performs well~(within one dB
away from the corresponding Shannon limits) in a wide range of code rates.

continuous at the surface with an outside dipole field. We examine the cases of
the field strength $B_{{\rm{S}}}\sim10^{16}$ G at the surface. Since separation
of variables is not possible for the oscillations of magnetized stars, we
employ finite series expansions for the perturbations using spherical harmonic
functions. We find discrete normal toroidal modes of odd parity, but no
toroidal modes of even parity are found. The frequencies of the toroidal modes
form distinct mode sequences and the frequency in a given mode sequence
gradually decreases as the number of radial nodes of the eigenfunction
increases. From the frequency spectra computed for neutron stars of different
masses, we find that the frequency is almost exactly proportional to
$B_{{\rm{S}}}$ and is well represented by a linear function of $R/M$ for a
given $B_{{\rm{S}}}$, where $M$ and $R$ are the mass and radius of the star.
The toroidal mode frequencies for $B_{{\rm{S}}}\sim 10^{15}$ G are in the

critically assess these proposals in a comprehensive review. The Planck data
shows an unmistakably red, quasi scale-invariant, purely adiabatic primordial
power spectrum and no primary non-Gaussianities. While these observations are
consistent with inflationary predictions, bouncing cosmologies aspire to
provide an alternative framework to explain them. Such models face many
problems, both of the purely theoretical kind, such as the necessity of
violating the NEC and instabilities, and at the cosmological application level,
as exemplified by the possible presence of shear. We provide a pedagogical
introduction to these problems and also assess the fitness of different
proposals with respect to the data. For example, many models predict a slightly
blue spectrum and must be fine-tuned to generate a red spectral index; as a
side effect, large non-Gaussianities often result.
  We highlight several promising attempts to violate the NEC without
introducing dangerous instabilities at the classical and/or quantum level. If
primordial gravitational waves are observed, certain bouncing cosmologies, such
as the cyclic scenario, are in trouble, while others remain valid. We conclude
that, while most bouncing cosmologies are far from providing an alternative to
the inflationary paradigm, a handful of interesting proposals have surfaced,
which warrant further research. The constraints and lessons learned as laid out
in this review might guide future research.

electrons and protons will be accelerated by the shocks. High energy neutrinos
could be produced by these protons interacting with stellar materials and
electron-radiating photons. The jet will probably be collimated, which may have
a strong effect on the final neutrino flux. Under the assumption of a power-law
stellar-envelope density profile $\rho \propto r^{-\alpha}$ with an index
$\alpha$, we calculate this neutrino emission flux by these shocks for
low-luminosity GRBs (LL-GRBs) and ultra-long GRBs (UL-GRBs) in different
collimation regimes, using the jet propagation framework developed by
\citet{bro11}. We find that LL-GRBs and UL-GRBs are capable for detectable high
energy neutrinos up to $\sim {\rm PeV}$, and obtain the final neutrino

neutrino flux at high energy end ($\sim {\rm PeV}$) and higher maximum neutrino
energy as well. However, such differences are so small that it is not promising
for us to distinguish from observations, given the energy resolution we have
now.

locations in an unknown graph. The agents have distinct labels and walk in
synchronous steps. However the graph is unlabelled and the agents have no means
of marking the nodes of the graph and cannot communicate with or see each other
until they meet at a node. When the graph is very large we want the time to
rendezvous to be independent of the graph size and to depend only on the
initial distance between the agents and some local parameters such as the
degree of the vertices, and the size of the agent's label. It is well known
that even for simple graphs of degree $\Delta$, the rendezvous time can be
exponential in $\Delta$ in the worst case. In this paper, we introduce a new
version of the rendezvous problem where the agents are equipped with a device
that measures its distance to the other agent after every step. We show that
these \emph{distance-aware} agents are able to rendezvous in any unknown graph,
in time polynomial in all the local parameters such the degree of the nodes,
the initial distance $D$ and the size of the smaller of the two agent labels $l

$O(\Delta(D+\log{l}))$ and we show an almost matching lower bound of
$\Omega(\Delta(D+\log{l}/\log{\Delta}))$ on the time complexity of any
rendezvous algorithm in our scenario. Further, this lower bound extends

employed, it is crucial to understand nanoscale friction and wear especially at
technically relevant sliding velocities. Accordingly, a novel technique has
been developed for Friction Coefficient Mapping (FCM), leveraging recent
advances in high speed AFM. The technique efficiently acquires friction versus
force curves based on a sequence of images at a single location, each with
incrementally lower loads. As a result, true maps of the coefficient of
friction can be uniquely calculated for heterogeneous surfaces. These
parameters are determined at a scan velocity as fast as 2 mm/s for
microfabricated SiO2 mesas and Au coated pits, yielding results that are
identical to traditional speed measurements despite being ~1000 times faster.
To demonstrate the upper limit of sliding velocity for the custom setup, the
friction properties of mica are reported from 200 {\mu}m/sec up to 2 cm/sec.
While FCM is applicable to any AFM and scanning speed, quantitative
nanotribology investigations of heterogeneous sliding or rolling components are
therefore uniquely possible, even at realistic velocities for devices such as
MEMS, biological implants, or data storage systems.

the Bolocam X-ray-SZ (BOXSZ) sample. All parameters are integrated within
$r_{2500}$. $Y_{2500}$ values are measured using SZE data collected with
Bolocam, operating at 140 GHz at the Caltech Submillimeter Observatory (CSO).
The temperature, $T_{\rm X}$, and mass, $M_{\rm gas,2500}$, of the intracluster
medium are determined using X-ray data collected with Chandra, and $M_{\rm
tot}$ is derived from $M_{\rm gas}$ assuming a constant gas mass fraction. Our
analysis accounts for several potential sources of bias, including: selection
effects, contamination from radio point sources, and the loss of SZE signal due
to noise filtering and beam-smoothing effects. We measure the
$Y_{2500}$--$Y_{\rm X}$ scaling to have a power-law index of $0.84\pm0.07$, and
a fractional intrinsic scatter in $Y_{2500}$ of $(21\pm7)\%$ at fixed $Y_{\rm
X}$, both of which are consistent with previous analyses. We also measure the
scaling between $Y_{2500}$ and $M_{2500}$, finding a power-law index of
$1.06\pm0.12$ and a fractional intrinsic scatter in $Y_{2500}$ at fixed mass of
$(25\pm9)\%$. While recent SZE scaling relations using X-ray mass proxies have
found power-law indices consistent with the self-similar prediction of 5/3, our
measurement stands apart by differing from the self-similar prediction by
approximately 5$\sigma$. Given the good agreement between the measured
$Y_{2500}$--$Y_{\rm X}$ scalings, much of this discrepancy appears to be caused
by differences in the calibration of the X-ray mass proxies adopted for each
particular analysis.

solvent is by now well-understood in terms of scaling laws. Here we consider a
polymer in a bacterial bath, i.e. in a solvent consisting of active particles
which bring in nonequilibrium fluctuations. Using computer simulations of a
self-avoiding polymer chain in two dimensions which is exposed to a dilute bath
of active particles, we show that the Flory-scaling exponent is unaffected by
the bath activity provided the chain is very long. Conversely, for shorter
chains, there is a nontrivial coupling between the bacteria intruding into the
chain which may stiffen and expand the chain in a nonuniversal way. As a
function of the molecular weight, the swelling first scales faster than
described by the Flory exponent, then an unusual plateau-like behaviour is
reached and finally a crossover to the universal Flory behaviour is observed.
As a function of bacterial activity, the chain end-to-end distance exhibits a
pronounced non-monotonicity. Moreover, the mean-square displacement of the
center of mass of the chain shows a ballistic behaviour at intermediate times
as induced by the active solvent. Our predictions are verifiable in
two-dimensional bacterial suspensions and for colloidal model chains exposed to
artificial colloidal microswimmers.

(receiver) in a spin-1/2 chain governed by the nearest-neighbor
$XY$-Hamiltonian. Owing to the evolution of the chain along with the variable
local unitary transformation of the one- or two-qubit sender, a large variety
of receiver states can be created during some time interval starting with a
fixed initial state of the whole quantum system. These states form the
creatable region of the receiver's state-space. It is remarkable that, having
the two-qubit sender, a large creatable region may be covered at a properly
fixed time instant $t_0$ using just the variable local unitary transformation
of the sender. In this case we have completely local control of the remote
state creation. In general, for a given initial state, there are such
receiver's states that may not be created using the above tool. These states
form the unavailable region. In turn, this unavailable region might be the
creatable region of another sender. Thus, in future, we have a way to share the
whole receiver's state-space among the creatable regions of several senders.
  The effectiveness of remote state creation is characterized by the density
function of the creatable region.

discontinuous (jumping) state trajectories. We consider state-triggered jumps
in the state evolution, potentially accompanied by mode switching in the
control vector field as well. For a given trajectory with state jumps, we show
how to construct an approximation of a nearby perturbed trajectory
corresponding to a small variation of the initial condition and input. A major
complication in the construction of such an approximation is that, in general,
the jump times corresponding to a nearby perturbed trajectory are not equal to
those of the nominal one. The main contribution of this work is the development
of a notion of error to clarify in which sense the approximate trajectory is,
at each instant of time, a firstorder approximation of the perturbed
trajectory. This notion of error naturally finds application in the (local)
tracking problem of a time-varying reference trajectory of a hybrid system. To
illustrate the possible use of this new error definition in the context of
trajectory tracking, we outline how the standard linear trajectory tracking
control for nonlinear systems -based on linear quadratic regulator (LQR) theory
to compute the optimal feedback gain- could be generalized for hybrid systems.

independently in each variable, which provides higher flexibility and accuracy.
However, the total amount of degrees of freedom grows exponentially with the

the data is kept compressed in the TT decomposition, a recurrent low-rank
factorization. PCE computations on sparse grids sets are extensively studied,
but the TT representation for PCE is a novel approach that is investigated in
this paper. We outline how to deduce the PCE from the covariance matrix,
assemble the Galerkin operator, and evaluate some post-processing (mean,
variance, Sobol indices), staying within the low-rank framework. The most
demanding are two stages. First, we interpolate PCE coefficients in the TT

approximation method. Second, we solve the discretized equation (large linear
system) via the alternating minimal energy algorithm. In the numerical

case it is necessary to understand the reasons thereof. This knowledge is
important even for people who do not use or do not develop/provide SaaS, since
sooner or later it will be unavoidable due to current trends. In the near
future, nearly all decision-makers of IT strategies will be forced to consider
adopting SaaS as an IT solution for the convenience benefits associated with
technology or market competition. At that time they will have to know how to
evaluate impacts and decide. Often, decision-makers of business strategies
consider only the attractive incentives of using SaaS ignoring the impacts
associated with new technologies. The need for tools and processes to assess
these impacts before adopting a SaaS solution is crucial to ensure the
sustainability of the information system, reduce uncertainty and facilitate
decision making. This article presents a framework for evaluating impacts of
SaaS called SIE (SaaS Impact Evaluation) which in addition to guidance for the

similar to those of the broad-lined Type Ic SN 2002ap, but the spectra show
remarkable differences. The optical spectra of SN 2007gr are characterized by
unusually narrow lines, prominent carbon lines, and slow evolution of the line
velocity after maximum light. The earliest spectrum (taken at t=-8 days) shows
a possible signature of helium (He~I 5876 at a velocity of ~19,000 km s{-1}).
Moreover, the larger intensity ratio of the [O I] 6300 and 6364 lines inferred
from the early nebular spectra implies a lower opacity of the ejecta shortly
after the explosion. These results indicate that SN 2007gr perhaps underwent a
less energetic explosion of a smaller-mass Wolf-Rayet star (~ 8--9 Msun) in a
binary system, as favored by an analysis of the progenitor environment through
pre-explosion and post-explosion Hubble Space Telescope images. In the nebular
spectra, asymmetric double-peaked profiles can be seen in the [O~I] 6300 and
Mg~I] 4571 lines. We suggest that the two peaks are contributed by the
blueshifted and rest-frame components. The similarity in velocity structure and
the different evolution of the strength of the two components favor an
aspherical explosion with the ejecta distributed in a torus or disk-like
geometry, but inside the ejecta the O and Mg have different distributions.

  (MPIMD/13-21)",,,,"math.NA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Krylov subspace recycling is a process for accelerating the convergence of
sequences of linear systems. Based on this technique, the recycling BiCG
algorithm has been developed recently. Here, we now generalize and extend this
recycling theory to BiCGSTAB. Recycling BiCG focuses on efficiently solving
sequences of dual linear systems, while the focus here is on efficiently
solving sequences of single linear systems (assuming non-symmetric matrices for
both recycling BiCG and recycling BiCGSTAB).
  As compared with other methods for solving sequences of single linear systems
with non-symmetric matrices (e.g., recycling variants of GMRES), BiCG based
recycling algorithms, like recycling BiCGSTAB, have the advantage that they
involve a short-term recurrence, and hence, do not suffer from storage issues
and are also cheaper with respect to the orthogonalizations.
  We modify the BiCGSTAB algorithm to use a recycle space, which is built from
left and right approximate invariant subspaces. Using our algorithm for a
parametric model order reduction example gives good results. We show about 40%
savings in the number of matrix-vector products and about 35% savings in
runtime.

single-letterization. We argue that this is due to the lack of a geometric
structure on the space of probability distribution. In this paper, we develop
such a structure by assuming that the distributions of interest are close to
each other. Under this assumption, the K-L divergence is reduced to the squared
Euclidean metric in an Euclidean space. In addition, we construct the notion of
coordinate and inner product, which will facilitate solving communication
problems. We will present the application of this approach to the
point-to-point channel, general broadcast channel, and the multiple access
channel (MAC) with the common source. It can be shown that with this approach,
information theory problems, such as the single-letterization, can be reduced
to some linear algebra problems. Moreover, we show that for the general
broadcast channel, transmitting the common message to receivers can be
formulated as the trade-off between linear systems. We also provide an example
to visualize this trade-off in a geometric way. Finally, for the MAC with the
common source, we observe a coherent combining gain due to the cooperation
between transmitters, and this gain can be quantified by applying our

of this paper is to study the geometry of domains for which, at any fixed value
of time, the normal derivative of the solution (heat flow) is a constant
function on the boundary. We express this fact by saying that such domains have
the constant flow property. In constant curvature spaces known examples of such
domains are given by geodesic balls and, more generally, by domains whose
boundary is connected and isoparametric. The question is: are they all like
that?
  In this paper we give an affirmative answer to this question: in fact we
prove more generally that, if a domain in an analytic Riemannian manifold has
the constant flow property, then every component of its boundary is an
isoparametric hypersurface. For space forms, we also relate the order of
vanishing of the heat content with fixed boundary data with the constancy of
the $r$-mean curvatures of the boundary and with the isoparametric property.
Finally, we discuss the constant flow property in relation to other well-known
overdetermined problems involving the Laplace operator, like the Serrin problem

specify the likelihood function up to a constant. While such models are natural
and popular, the lack of normalisation makes inference much more difficult.
Here we show that inferring the parameters of a unnormalised model on a space
$\Omega$ can be mapped onto an equivalent problem of estimating the intensity
of a Poisson point process on $\Omega$. The unnormalised statistical model now
specifies an intensity function that does not need to be normalised.
Effectively, the normalisation constant may now be inferred as just another
parameter, at no loss of information. The result can be extended to cover
non-IID models, which includes for example unnormalised models for sequences of
graphs (dynamical graphs), or for sequences of binary vectors. As a
consequence, we prove that unnormalised parameteric inference in non-IID models
can be turned into a semi-parametric estimation problem. Moreover, we show that
the noise-contrastive divergence of Gutmann & Hyv\""arinen (2012) can be
understood as an approximation of the Poisson transform, and extended to
non-IID settings. We use our results to fit spatial Markov chain models of eye
movements, where the Poisson transform allows us to turn a highly non-standard

well known that parallel tree search changes the order in which the exploration
of solution space is done. In the context where the first solution found is
returned, using a different number of cores may change the returned solution.
In the literature, several non deterministic strategies have been proposed to
parallelize the exploration of Constraint Programming search space. Most of
them are based on the Work Stealing technique used to partition the Constraint
Programming search space on demand and during the execution of the search
algorithm. Our study focuses on the determinism of the parallel search versus
the sequential one. We consider that the sequential search algorithm is
deterministic, then propose an elegant solution introducing a total order on
the nodes in which the parallel algorithm always gives the same solution as the
sequential one regardless of the number of cores used. To evaluate this

S-stars. However, the evolution of orbits below the SB, $e>e_\mathrm{SB}$, is
not well understood; the main current limitation is the computational
complexity of detailed simulations. Here we present an $N$-body algorithm that
allows us to efficiently integrate orbits of test stars around a SBH including
general relativistic corrections to the equations of motion and interactions
with a large ($\gtrsim 10^3$) number of field stars. We apply our algorithm to
the S-stars and extract diffusion coefficients describing the evolution in
angular momentum $L$. We identify three angular momentum regimes, in which the
diffusion coefficients depend in functionally different ways on $L$. Regimes of
lowest and highest $L$ are well-described in terms of non-resonant relaxation
(NRR) and resonant relaxation (RR), respectively. In addition, we find a new
regime of ""anomalous relaxation"" (AR). We present analytic expressions, in

NIR long-slit spectrograph ISAAC (VLT) in a drift-scan to construct an
integral-field spectroscopic map of the central 9.5 x 8pc of our Galaxy. We use
this data set to extract stellar kinematics both of individual stars and from
the unresolved integrated light spectrum. We present a velocity and dispersion
map from the integrated light and model these kinematics using kinemetry and
axisymmetric Jeans models. We also measure CO bandhead strengths of 1,375
spectra from individual stars. We find kinematic complexity in the NSCs radial
velocity map including a misalignment of the kinematic position angle by 9
degree counterclockwise relative to the Galactic plane, and indications for a
rotating substructure perpendicular to the Galactic plane at a radius of 20"" or
0.8pc. We determine the mass of the NSC within r = 4.2pc to 1.4 x 10^7 Msun. We
also show that our kinematic data results in a significant underestimation of
the supermassive black hole (SMBH) mass. The kinematic substructure and
position angle misalignment may hint at distinct accretion events. This
indicates that the MWNSC grew at least partly by the mergers of massive star
clusters. Compared to other NSCs, the MWNSC is on the compact side of the r_eff
- M_NSC relation. The underestimation of the SMBH mass might be caused by the
kinematic misalignment and a stellar population gradient. But it is also
possible that there is a bias in SMBH mass measurements obtained with

for an arbitrary photon statistics. This problem is related to the interaction
of a light beam with a macroscopic device, for example a diaphragm, that
separates the photon flux into two parts with known probabilities. To solve
this problem, a Generalized Binomial Distribution (GBD) is derived that is
applicable to an arbitrary photon statistics satisfying probability convolution
equations. It is shown that if photons obey Poisson statistics then the GBD is
reduced to the ordinary binomial distribution, whereas in the case of
Bose-Einstein statistics the GBD is reduced to the Polya distribution. In this
case, the photon spatial distribution depends on the phase-space volume
occupied by the photons. This result involves a photon bunching effect, or
collective behavior of photons that sharply differs from the behavior of
classical particles. It is shown that the photon bunching effect looks similar
to the quantum interference effect.

$D$ is the diameter of the communication graph and $n$ is the number of

novel distributed coloring method, which is of independent interest and
potential applicability to other communication tasks under the SINR wireless

are determined making use of chi-square minimization technique. The analysis is
carried out here considering the Wang-Steinhardt ansatz for growth index

Subsequently, the best-fit values of the EoS parameters are used to study the
evolution of the growth function $f$, growth index $\gamma$, state parameter
$\omega$ with red shift parameter $z$. The present value of the parameters,

also derive a semiclassical approximation of the canonical partition function
of the model by assuming $\hbar$ to be small in the regime of large enough
total number of excitations $n$, where the dimension of the Hilbert space of
the problem becomes constant as a function of $n$. We observe in this case an
interesting behaviour of the average of the bosonic number operator showing a
single crossover between regimes with different integer values of this
observable. These features persist when we generalize the parafermionic
Hamiltonian by deforming the bosonic oscillator with a generic function
$\Phi(x)$; the $q-$deformed bosonic oscillator corresponds to a specific choice
of the deformation function $\Phi$. In this particular case, we observe at most
$k(F-1)$ crossovers in the behavior of the mean bosonic number operator,
suggesting a phenomenology of superradiance similar to the $k-$atoms Jaynes
Cummings model.

an appendix, we identify new morphological features of NGC 1316 and its
companion galaxy NGC 1317. The GC sample based on radial velocities confirms
the colour peaks already found in our photometric study. The bright clusters,
which probably have their origin in a 2 Gyr-old starburst and younger star
formation events, avoid the systemic velocity. A Gaussian velocity distribution
is found only for clusters fainter than about m_R=22 mag. The velocity
distribution of clusters shows a pronounced peak at 1600 km/s. These clusters
populate a wide area in the south-western region which we suspect to be a disk
population. Globular clusters or subsamples of them do not show a clear
rotation signal. This is different from the galaxy light, where rotation along
the major axis is discernable out to 3 arcmin radius. A simple spherical model
like that suggested by dynamical analyses of planetary nebulae reproduces also
the velocity dispersions of the faint GCs. The central dark matter density of
the present model resembles a giant elliptical galaxy. This contradicts
population properties which indicate spiral galaxies as pre-merger components.
MOND would provide a solution, but the kinematical complexity of NGC 1316 does
not allow a really firm conclusion. (abridged)

must be able to control the valency of the colloids, i.e. the number of
partners to which a given DNACC can bind. One obvious, but not very simple
approach is to decorate the colloidal surface with patches of single-stranded
DNA that selectively bind those on other colloids. Here we propose a design
principle that exploits many-body effects to control the valency of otherwise
isotropic colloids. Using a combination of theory and simulation, we show that
we can tune the valency of colloids coated with mobile ssDNA, simply by tuning
the non-specific repulsion between the particles. Our simulations show that the
resulting effective interactions lead to low-valency colloids self-assembling
in peculiar open structures, very different from those observed in DNACCs with
immobile DNA linkers.

wireless connectivity: Any data service is instantly accessible everywhere.
With each generation of cellular networks, we have moved closer to this
wireless dream; first by delivering wireless access to voice communications,
then by providing wireless data services, and recently by delivering a
WiFi-like experience with wide-area coverage and user mobility management. The
support for high data rates has been the main objective in recent years, as
seen from the academic focus on sum-rate optimization and the efforts from
standardization bodies to meet the peak rate requirements specified in
IMT-Advanced. In contrast, a variety of metrics/objectives are put forward in
the technological preparations for 5G networks: higher peak rates, improved
coverage with uniform user experience, higher reliability and lower latency,
better energy efficiency, lower-cost user devices and services, better
scalability with number of devices, etc. These multiple objectives are coupled,
often in a conflicting manner such that improvements in one objective lead to
degradation in the other objectives. Hence, the design of future networks calls
for new optimization tools that properly handle the existence and tradeoffs
between multiple objectives.
  In this article, we provide a review of multi-objective optimization (MOO),
which is a mathematical framework to solve design problems with multiple
conflicting objectives. (...) We provide a survey of the basic definitions,
properties, and algorithmic tools in MOO. This reveals how signal processing
algorithms are used to visualize the inherent conflicts between 5G performance
objectives, thereby allowing the network designer to understand the possible
operating points and how to balance the objectives in an efficient and
satisfactory way. For clarity, we provide a case study on massive MIMO.

have revealed that the powerful radio galaxy 3C 220.3 at z=0.685 acts as a
gravitational lens for a background submillimeter galaxy (SMG) at z=2.221. At
an observed wavelength of 1mm, the SMG is lensed into three distinct images. In
the observed near infrared, these images are connected by an arc of 1.8"" radius
forming an Einstein half-ring centered near the radio galaxy. In visible light,
only the arc is apparent. 3C 220.3 is the only known instance of strong
galaxy-scale lensing by a powerful radio galaxy not located in a galaxy cluster
and therefore it offers the potential to probe the dark matter content of the
radio galaxy host. Lens modeling rejects a single lens, but two lenses centered
on the radio galaxy host A and a companion B, separated by 1.5"", provide a fit
consistent with all data and reveal faint candidates for the predicted fourth
and fifth images. The model does not require an extended common dark matter
halo, consistent with the absence of extended bright X-ray emission on our
Chandra image. The projected dark matter fractions within the Einstein radii of
A (1.02"") and B (0.61"") are about 0.4 +/- 0.3 and 0.55 +/- 0.3. The mass to
i-band light ratios of A and B, M/L ~ 8 +/- 4 Msun/Lsun, appear comparable to
those of radio-quiet lensing galaxies at the same redshift in the CASTLES, LSD,
and SL2S samples. The lensed SMG is extremely bright with observed f(250um) =
440mJy owing to a magnification factor mu~10. The SMG spectrum shows luminous,
narrow CIV 154.9nm emission, revealing that the SMG houses a hidden quasar in
addition to a violent starburst. Multicolor image reconstruction of the SMG
indicates a bipolar morphology of the emitted ultraviolet (UV) light suggestive
of cones through which UV light escapes a dust-enshrouded nucleus.

often not sufficient to fit the entire range of the probability distribution of
the empirical data, and fit better to two distinct functions with a single
crossover point. Here we provide general formulas to calculate these inequality
measures for the above cases. We attempt to specify the crossover point by
minimizing the gap between empirical and analytical evaluations of measures.
Regarding the $k$ index as an `extra dimension', both the lower and upper

of inequality relations among inequality indices might help us to check the

But these surface transports are buried in presence of metallic bulk
conduction. We synthesized very high quality Bi$_2$Te$_2$Se single crystals by
modified Bridgman method, that possess high bulk resistivity of
$>$20~$\Omega$cm below 20~K, whereas the bulk is mostly inactive and surface
transport dominates. Temperature dependence resistivity follows the activation
law like a gap semiconductor in temperature range 20-300~K. We designed a
special measurement geometry, which aims to extract the surface transport from
the bulk. This special geometry is applied to measure the resistance and found
that Bi$_2$Te$_2$Se single crystal exhibits a cross over from bulk to surface
conduction at 20~K. Simultaneously, the material also shows strong evidence of
weak anti-localization in magneto-transport due to the protection against
scattering by conducting surface states. This novel simple geometry is an easy
route to find the evidence of surface transport in topological insulators,
which are the promising materials for future spintronic applications.

in the practice of scientific disciplines. However, scientometric studies have
typically focused on a single genre, the journal article. The goal of this
study is to understand the role that handbooks play in knowledge creation and
diffusion and their relationship with the genre of journal articles,
particularly in highly interdisciplinary and emergent social science and
humanities disciplines. To shed light on these questions we focused on
handbooks and journal articles published over the last four decades belonging
to the research area of Science and Technology Studies (STS), broadly defined.
To get a detailed picture we used the full-text of five handbooks (500,000
words) and a well-defined set of 11,700 STS articles. We confirmed the
methodological split of STS into qualitative and quantitative (scientometric)
approaches. Even when the two traditions explore similar topics (e.g., science
and gender) they approach them from different starting points. The change in
cognitive foci in both handbooks and articles partially reflects the changing
trends in STS research, often driven by technology. Using text similarity
measures we found that, in the case of STS, handbooks play no special role in
either focusing the research efforts or marking their decline. In general, they
do not represent the summaries of research directions that have emerged since
the previous edition of the handbook.

used to study the kinetics via a generalised diffusion equation. To test this

nanoparticles, and show that the dynamics obtained within DDFT is consistent
with that extrapolated from experiments. We also perform a systematic study of
the effect of various parameters in our model, and investigate the loading
dynamics as a function of proteins' valence and hydrophobic adsorption energy,
as well as their concentration and that of the nanoparticles. Although we
concentrated here on the case of adsorption for a single protein type, the

also provide downlink communications require high average optical powers in
order to satisfy the illumination needs. This can cause high amplitude signals
common in higher-order modulation schemes to be clipped by the peak power
constraint of the light emitting diode (LED) and lead to high signal
distortion. In this paper we introduce Hadamard coded modulation (HCM) to
achieve low error probabilities in LED-based VLC systems needing high average
optical powers. This technique uses a fast Walsh-Hadamard transform (FWHT) to
modulate the data as an alternative modulation technique to orthogonal
frequency division multiplexing (OFDM). HCM achieves a better performance for
high illumination levels because of its small peak to average power ratio
(PAPR). The power efficiency of HCM can be improved by reducing the DC part of
the transmitted signals without losing any information. The resulting so-called
DC-reduced HCM (DCR-HCM) is well suited to environments requiring dimmer
lighting as it transmits signals with lower peak amplitudes compared to HCM,
which are thus subject to less nonlinear distortion. Interleaving can be
applied to HCM to make the resulting signals more resistant against
inter-symbol interference (ISI) in dispersive VLC links.

and Huntington (WH) predicted its existence in 1935. The density obtained
experimentally is within a few percent of the density predicted by WH. Metallic
fluid H was achieved by multiple-shock compression of liquid H2, which
compression is quasi-isentropic and H is thermally equilibrated in experiments
with 100 ns lifetimes. Quasi-isentropic means compressions are isentropic but
with sufficient temperature and entropy to drive a crossover from liquid H2 to
degenerate fluid H at 9-fold compression and pressure P=140 GPa (1.4 Mbar). The
metallic fluid is highly degenerate: T/TF 0.014, where temperature T=3000 K and
Fermi temperature TF =220,000 K, respectively, at metallization density 0.64
mol H/cm3.
  Dynamic compression is achieved by supersonic, adiabatic, nonlinear
hydrodynamics, the basic ideas of which were developed in the Nineteenth
Century in European universities. Today dynamic compression is generally
unfamiliar to the scientific community. The purposes of this paper are to
present a brief review of (i) dynamic compression and its affects on materials,

fluctuations lead to an imaginary term in their action signaling an instability
in the system. Due to this instability, a phase transition is expected. On the
gauge theory side, it indicates that the quarkonium mesons are not stable and
dissociate in the plasma. Identifying the imaginary part of the probe barne
action with the thermal width of the mesons, we observe that the thermal width
increases as one decreases the mass of the quarks. Also keeping the mass fixed,
thermal width increases by temperature as expected.

protocols. Within the last decades, various techniques for covert channels
arose. We surveyed and analyzed 109 techniques developed between 1987 and 2013
and show that these techniques can be reduced to only 11 different patterns.
Moreover, the majority (69.7%) of techniques can be categorized in only four
different patterns, i.e. most of the techniques we surveyed are very similar.
We represent the patterns in a hierarchical catalog using a pattern language.
Our pattern catalog will serve as a base for future covert channel novelty
evaluation. Furthermore, we apply the concept of pattern variations to network
covert channels. With pattern variations, the context of a pattern can change.
For example, a channel developed for IPv4 can automatically be adapted to other
network protocols. We also propose the pattern-based covert channel
optimizations pattern hopping and pattern combination. Finally, we lay the
foundation for pattern-based countermeasures: While many current
countermeasures were developed for specific channels, a pattern-oriented
approach allows to apply one countermeasure to multiple channels. Hence, future
countermeasure development can focus on patterns, and the development of
real-world protection against covert channels is greatly simplified.

Recently, we showed that a mutlimode optical fiber can also function as a

interference between the guided modes. Here, we reach a record resolution of 1
pm at wavelength 1500 nm using a 100 meter long multimode fiber, outperforming

study the model as a function of the strength of the next-nearest-neighbor

nearest-neighbor interactions that exhibit limit-periodic phases. For models
with no next-nearest-neighbor interactions of the Taylor-Socolar type, there is
a large degenerate classes of ground states, including crystalline patterns and
limit-periodic ones, but a slow quench still yields the limit-periodic state.
For the Taylor-Socolar lattice model, we present calculations of the
diffraction pattern for a particular decoration of the tile that permits exact
expressions for the amplitudes, and identify domain walls that slow the
relaxation times in the ordered phases. For one of the 3D models, we show that
the phase transitions are first order, with equilibrium structures that can be
more complex than in the 2D case, and we include a proof of aperiodicity for a

the time and the frequency domain by comparison with state-of-the-art frequency
references developed at LNE-SYRTE. In free-running mode, it features a residual
phase noise level of -65 dBrad$^2.Hz^{-1} at 10-Hz offset frequency and a white

A multivariate analysis reduces the background of hadronic cosmic rays. The
search is sensitive to a declination band from -85{\deg} to +20{\deg}, in an
energy range from 10^17.3 eV to 10^18.5 eV. No photon point source has been
detected. An upper limit on the photon flux has been derived for every
direction. The mean value of the energy flux limit that results from this,
assuming a photon spectral index of -2, is 0.06 eV cm^-2 s^-1, and no celestial
direction exceeds 0.25 eV cm^-2 s^-1. These upper limits constrain scenarios in

properties of the sample paths and seeks for some global scaling property that
would enable extracting the so-called spectrum of singularities. In this paper
we establish bounds on the support of the spectrum of singularities. To do
this, we prove a theorem that complements the famous Kolmogorov's continuity
criterion. The nature of these bounds helps us identify the quantities truly
responsible for the support of the spectrum. We then make several conclusions
from this. First, specifying global scaling in terms of moments is incomplete
due to possible infinite moments, both of positive and negative order. For the
case of ergodic self-similar processes we show that negative order moments and
their divergence do not affect the spectrum. On the other hand, infinite
positive order moments make the spectrum nontrivial. In particular, we show
that the self-similar stationary increments process with the nontrivial
spectrum must be heavy-tailed. This shows that for determining the spectrum it
is crucial to capture the divergence of moments. We show that the partition
function is capable of doing this and also propose a robust variant of this
method for negative order moments.

important to basic science and conservation. In recent years, considerable
progress was made in explaining communities using simple and general models,
with neutral theory as a prominent example. However, while successful in
explaining static patterns such as species abundance distributions, the neutral
theory was criticized for making unrealistic predictions of fundamental dynamic
patterns. Here we incorporate environmental stochasticity into the neutral
framework, and show that the resulting generalized neutral theory is capable of
predicting realistic patterns of both population and community dynamics.
Applying the theory to real data (the tropical forest of Barro-Colorado
Island), we find that it better fits the observed distribution of short-term
fluctuations, the temporal scaling of such fluctuations, and the decay of
compositional similarity with time, than the original theory, while retaining
its power to explain static patterns of species abundance. Importantly,
although the proposed theory is neutral (all species are functionally
equivalent) and stochastic, it is a niche-based theory in the sense that
species differ in their demographic responses to environmental variation. Our
results show that this integration of niche forces and stochasticity within a
minimalistic neutral framework is highly successful in explaining fundamental
static and dynamic characteristics of ecological communities.

combinatorial possibilities. Despite the existence of a rich literature,
spanning a variety of disciplines, elaborating on the recombinant nature of
invention, we lack a formal and quantitative characterization of the
combinatorial process underpinning inventive activity. Here we utilize U.S.
patent records dating from 1790 to 2010 to formally characterize the invention
as a combinatorial process. To do this we treat patented inventions as carriers
of technologies and avail ourselves of the elaborate system of technology codes
used by the U.S. Patent Office to classify the technologies responsible for an
invention's novelty. We find that the combinatorial inventive process exhibits
an invariant rate of ""exploitation"" (refinements of existing combinations of
technologies) and ""exploration"" (the development of new technological
combinations). This combinatorial dynamic contrasts sharply with the creation
of new technological capabilities -- the building blocks to be combined --
which has significantly slowed down. We also find that notwithstanding the very
reduced rate at which new technologies are introduced, the generation of novel
technological combinations engenders a practically infinite space of
technological configurations.

well satisfied even when electron-electron (e-e) interactions are strong. In
ultra-clean conductors, however, large deviations from the standard form of the
law are expected, due to the fact that e-e interactions affect the two
conductivities in radically different ways. Thus, the standard Wiedemann-Franz
ratio between the thermal and the electric conductivity is reduced by a factor
$1+\tau/\tau_{\rm th}^{\rm ee}$, where $1/\tau$ is the momentum relaxation

blended. In this work, the profiles of these three infra-red (IR) lines have
been studied theoretically and compared to experimental spectra to assist in
the complete understanding of the solar spectrum in the IR. It is shown that
the structure of these lines can not be described in the conventional way by
the diagonal $A$ and $B$ hyperfine interaction constants. The off-diagonal
hyperfine interaction not only has large impact on the energies of the
hyperfine levels, but also introduces a large intensity redistribution among
the hyperfine lines, changing the line profiles dramatically. By performing
large-scale calculations of the diagonal and off-diagonal hyperfine interaction
and $gf$-values between the upper and lower hyperfine levels and using a
semi-empirical fitting procedure, agreement between our synthetic and

that always lead to polarization (in the general multilevel sense) when they

two parts, solves this problem by providing a necessary and sufficient
condition for a binary operation to be polarizing. This (first) part of the
paper introduces the mathematical framework that we will use in the second part
to characterize the polarizing operations. We define uniformity preserving,
irreducible, ergodic and strongly ergodic operations and we study their
properties. The concepts of a stable partition and the residue of a stable
partition are introduced. We show that an ergodic operation is strongly ergodic
if and only if all its stable partitions are their own residues. We also study
the products of binary operations and the structure of their stable partitions.
We show that the product of a sequence of binary operations is strongly ergodic
if and only if all the operations in the sequence are strongly ergodic. In the
second part of the paper, we provide a foundation of polarization theory based
on the ergodic theory of binary operations that we develop in this part.

optimization, additional light sources are being used. Traditional light
sources such as high pressure sodium lamps and other metal halide lamps are not
very efficient and generate high radiant heat. Therefore, new sustainable
solutions should be developed for energy efficient greenhouse lighting. Recent
developments in the field of light source technologies have opened up new
perspectives for sustainable and highly efficient light sources in the form of
light-emitting diodes, i.e. LEDs, for greenhouse lighting. This review focuses
on the potential of LEDs to replace traditional light sources in the
greenhouse. In a comparative economic analysis of traditional vs. LED lighting,
we show that the introduction of LEDs allows reduction of the production cost
of vegetables in the long-run of several years, due to the high energy
efficiency, low maintenance cost and longevity of LEDs. In order to evaluate
LEDs as a true alternative to current lighting sources, species specific plant
response to different wavelengths is discussed in a comparative study. However,
more detailed scientific studies are necessary to understand the effect of
different LED spectra on plants physiology. Technical innovations are required
to design and realize an energy efficient light source with a spectrum tailored
for optimal plant growth in specific plant species.

Particularly, this is shown that this idea is able to generate new types of
non-abelian both dyons and magnetic monopoles and, moreover, that within the
new model the scalar field can be described through the Coulomb potential,
whereas, up to a constant, the non-abelian gauge field becomes the Wu-Yang
monopole.
