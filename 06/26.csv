associated excessive pay packages of CEOs in the U.S. and elsewhere, is of
growing concern among policy makers as well as the common person. However,
there seems to be no satisfactory answer, in conventional economic theories and
models, to the fundamental question of what kind of pay distribution we ought
to see, at least under ideal conditions, in a free market environment and
whether this distribution is fair. We propose a game theoretic framework that
addresses these questions and show that the lognormal distribution is the
fairest inequality of pay in an organization comprising of homogenous agents,
achieved at equilibrium, under ideal free market conditions. We also show that
for a population of two different classes of agents, the final distribution is
a combination of two different lognormal distributions where one of them,
corresponding to the top 3-5% of the population, can be misidentified as a
Pareto distribution. Our theory also shows the deep and direct connection
between potential game theory and statistical mechanics through entropy, which
is a measure of fairness in a distribution. This leads us to propose the fair
market hypothesis, that the self-organizing dynamics of the ideal free market,
i.e., Adam Smith's ""invisible hand"", not only promotes efficiency but also
maximizes fairness under the given constraints.

mean-field Poisson-Boltzmann solution. For the unconstrained model, the large-d
asymptotic behaviour of the free-fermion pressure differs from that predicted
by the mean-field theory. For the constrained model, the asymptotic pressure
coincides with the attractive van der Waals-Casimir fluctuational force. For
both models, there are fundamental differences between the cases of

thin-films are synthesized on various substrates using an epi-stabilization
technique. We have observed that as in-plane lattice compression is increased,
the dc-resistivity (\r{ho}) of the thin films increases by a few orders of
magnitude, and the d\r{ho}/dT changes from positive to negative values.
However, optical absorption spectra show Drude-like, metallic responses without
an optical gap opening for all compressively-strained thin films. Transport
measurements under magnetic fields show negative magneto-resistance at low
temperature for compressively-strained thin-films. Our results suggest that
weak localization is responsible for the strain-induced metal-insulator
transition for the orthorhombic SrIrO3 thin-films.

long-distance decay of the mutual information follows the square of that of the
most slowly decaying generalized correlation function. The main advantage of
our procedure is that, in order to identify the most relevant physical
processes, there is no need to know a priori the nature of the ordering in the

functions. We explore the behavior of the mutual information and the
generalized correlation functions for conformally invariant models and for the

These fits are derived from reflected-light near-infrared images taken
simultaneously with thermal emission measurements, allowing for more accurate
measurements of the near-infrared albedos than is possible for visible albedo
measurements. As our sample requires reflected light measurements, it
undersamples small, low albedo asteroids, as well as those with blue spectral
slopes across the wavelengths investigated. We find that the Main Belt
separates into three distinct groups of 6%, 16%, and 40% reflectance at 3.4 um.
Conversely, the 4.6 um albedo distribution spans the full range of possible
values with no clear grouping. Asteroid families show a narrow distribution of
3.4 um albedos within each family that map to one of the three observed
groupings, with the (221) Eos family being the sole family associated with the

the absence of restrictive pre-suppositions on the underlying dynamical
structure of the data at hand, is non-trivial. Nevertheless, ability to
computationally infer statistical prima facie evidence of causal dependence may
yield a far more discriminative tool for data analysis compared to the
calculation of simple correlations. In the present work, we present a new
non-parametric test of Granger causality for quantized or symbolic data streams
generated by ergodic stationary sources. In contrast to state-of-art binary
tests, our approach makes precise and computes the degree of causal dependence
between data streams, without making any restrictive assumptions, linearity or
otherwise. Additionally, without any a priori imposition of specific dynamical
structure, we infer explicit generative models of causal cross-dependence,
which may be then used for prediction. These explicit models are represented as
generalized probabilistic automata, referred to crossed automata, and are shown
to be sufficient to capture a fairly general class of causal dependence. The
proposed algorithms are computationally efficient in the PAC sense; $i.e.$, we
find good models of cross-dependence with high probability, with polynomial
run-times and sample complexities. The theoretical results are applied to
weekly search-frequency data from Google Trends API for a chosen set of

reveals, quite expectedly, the causal importance of certain keywords. It is

ignored, a power law with exponent beta = -0.22 provides a crude approximation
over P=1.4 -- 2000 d, as does a piece-wise linear function with a break near 45

correction for completeness, indicating either a lower binary fraction or a
shift toward low-mass companions. A high degree of similarity (91% likelihood)
between the Cyg OB2 period distribution and that of other surveys suggests that
the binary properties at P<25 d are determined by local physics of disk/clump
fragmentation and are relatively insensitive to environmental and evolutionary

(SALT) to treat complex gain media. The generalized theory (C-SALT) is able to
treat atomic and molecular gain media with diffusion and multiple lasing

including fully the effect of Pauli blocking. The key assumption of the theory
is stationarity of the level populations, which leads to coupled
self-consistent equations for the populations and the lasing modes that fully
include the effects of openness and non-linear spatial hole-burning. These
equations can be solved efficiently for the steady-state lasing properties by a
similar iteration procedure as in SALT, where a static gain medium with a
single transition is assumed. The theory is tested by comparison to much less
efficient Finite Difference Time Domain (FDTD) methods and excellent agreement
is found. Using C-SALT to analyze the effects of varying gain diffusion
constant we demonstrate a cross-over between the regime of strong spatial hole
burning with multimode lasing to a regime of negligible spatial hole burning,
leading to gain-clamping, and single mode lasing. The effect of spatially

time reversal symmetry is broken. Can these two phenomena coexist in the same

answer is yes. Moreover, it is theoretically possible that the onset of
antiferromagnetism enables the non-trivial topology since it may create
spin-orbit coupling effects which are absent in the non-magnetic phase. The

antisymmetric matter. The presence of the antisymmetric fields leads to further
splitting of the Coulomb branch. Counting zero modes in the instanton
background suggests that more than a single direction along the Coulomb branch
may remain unlifted. We examine the case of SU(4) with one or two antisymmetric
fields and various flavors in detail. Using the results for the corresponding
4D theories, we find the IR dynamics of the 3D cases via compactification and a
real mass deformation. We find that for the s-confining case with two
antisymmetric fields, a second unlifted Coulomb branch direction indeed appears
in the low-energy dynamics. We present several non-trivial consistency checks
to establish the validity of these results. We also comment on the expected
structure of general s-confining theories in 3D, which might involve several
unlifted Coulomb branch directions.

Intermediate Mass Black Holes (IMBH, 10^{4-6} Msun) formed inside metal-free,
UV illuminated atomic cooling haloes (virial temperature T_vir > 10^4 K) either
via the direct collapse of the gas or via an intermediate Super Massive Star
(SMS) stage. We achieve this goal in three steps: (a) we derive the gas
accretion rate for a proto-SMS to undergo General Relativity instability and
produce a direct collapse black hole (DCBH) or to enter the ZAMS and later
collapse into a IMBH; (b) we use merger-tree simulations to select atomic
cooling halos in which either a DCBH or SMS can form and grow, accounting for
metal enrichment and major mergers that halt the growth of the proto-SMS by gas
fragmentation. We derive the properties of the host halos and the mass
distribution of black holes at this stage, and dub it the ""Birth Mass
Function""; (c) we follow the further growth of the DCBH due to accretion of
leftover gas in the parent halo and compute the final IMBH mass.We consider two
extreme cases in which minihalos (T_vir < 10^4 K) can (fertile) or cannot
(sterile) form stars and pollute their gas leading to a different IMBH IMF. In
the (fiducial) fertile case the IMF is bimodal extending over a broad range of
masses, M= (0.5-20)x10^5 Msun, and the DCBH accretion phase lasts from 10 to
100 Myr. If minihalos are sterile, the IMF spans the narrower mass range M=
(1-2.8)x10^6 Msun, and the DCBH accretion phase is more extended (70-120 Myr).
We conclude that a good seeding prescription is to populate halos (a) of mass
7.5 < log (M_h/Msun) < 8, (b) in the redshift range 8 < z < 17, (c) with IMBH
in the mass range 4.75 < log (M_BH/Msun) < 6.25.

on the behaviour of Mo I and Ru I at higher and lower metallicity than is
currently known. We find a wide spread in the Mo and Ru abundances, which is
typical of heavy elements. This indicates that several formation processes, in
addition to high entropy winds, can be responsible for the formation of Mo and
Ru. The formation processes are traced by comparing Mo and Ru to elements (Sr,
Zr, Pd, Ag, Ba, and Eu) with known formation processes. We find contributions
from different formation channels, namely p-, slow (s-), and rapid (r-)
neutron-capture processes. Molybdenum is a highly convolved element that
receives contributions from several processes, whereas Ru is mainly formed by
the weak r-process as is silver. We also compare our absolute elemental stellar
abundances to relative isotopic abundances of presolar grains extracted from
meteorites. Their isotopic abundances can be directly linked to the formation
process (e.g. r-only isotopes) providing a unique comparison between
observationally derived abundances and the nuclear formation process. The
comparison to abundances in presolar grains shows that the r-/s-process ratios
from the presolar grains match the total elemental chemical composition derived
from metal-poor halo stars with [Fe/H]~ -1.5 to -1.1 dex. This indicates that
both grains and stars around and above [Fe/H]=-1.5 are equally (well) mixed and

naturally give rise to a 126 GeV Higgs boson. However, without having a
custodial symmetry it suffers from the weak-isospin violation constraint, which
pushes the chiral symmetry breaking scale above a few TeV, causing a
substantial fine-tuning for the weak scale. We consider an extension to the
minimal model to incorporate the custodial symmetry by adding a vector-like
electroweak doublet of quarks with hypercharge +7/6. Such a setup also protects
the $Zb\bar{b}$ coupling which is another challenge for many composite Higgs
models. With this addition, the chiral symmetry breaking scale can be lowered
to around 1 TeV, making the theory much less fine-tuned. The Higgs is a
pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone boson of the broken O(5) symmetry. For the Higgs mass to

both semi-analytic modeling and simulations of long-term evolution where two-
or three-dimensional calculations are too computationally costly. Despite the
utility of these models, the only publicly-available frameworks for simulating
them are rather specialized and non-general. Here we describe a highly
flexible, general numerical method for simulating viscous thin disks with
arbitrary rotation curves, viscosities, boundary conditions, grid spacings,
equations of state, and rates of gain or loss of mass (e.g., through winds) and
energy (e.g., through radiation). Our method is based on a conservative,
finite-volume, second-order accurate discretization of the equations, which we
solve using an unconditionally-stable implicit scheme. We implement Anderson
acceleration to speed convergence of the scheme, and show that this leads to
factor of $\sim 5$ speed gains over non-accelerated methods in realistic
problems, though the amount of speedup is highly problem-dependent. We have

galaxies (VIPERS) of ~50,000 objects to measure the biasing relation between
galaxies and mass in the redshift range z=[0.5,1.1]. We estimate the 1-point
distribution function [PDF] of VIPERS galaxies from counts in cells and,
assuming a model for the mass PDF, we infer their mean bias relation. The
reconstruction of the bias relation from PDFs is performed through a novel
method that accounts for Poisson noise, redshift distortions, inhomogeneous sky
coverage and other selection effects. With this procedure we constrain galaxy
bias and its deviations from linearity down to scales as small as 4 Mpc/h and
out to z=1.1. We detect small (~3%) but significant deviations from linear
bias. The mean biasing function is close to linear in regions above the mean
density. The mean slope of the biasing relation is a proxy to the linear bias
parameter. It increases both with luminosity, in agreement with results of
previous analyses, and with redshift. However, we detect a strong bias
evolution only for z>0.9 in agreement with some, but not all, previous studies.
We also detected a significant increase of the bias with the scale, from 4 to 8
Mpc/h, now seen for the first time out to z=1. The amplitude of nonlinearity
depends on redshift, luminosity and on scales but no clear trend is detected.
Thanks to the large cosmic volume probed by VIPERS we find that the mismatch
between the previous estimates of bias at z~1 from zCOSMOS and VVDS-Deep galaxy
samples is fully accounted for by cosmic variance. The results of our work
confirm the importance of going beyond the over-simplistic linear bias
hypothesis showing that non-linearities can be accurately measured through the
applications of the appropriate statistical tools to existing datasets like
VIPERS.

work we consider the GeV light curves of ten GRBs with measured redshift
detected by the Fermi-LAT. These light curves are characterised by a long-lived
($\gtrsim10^2$ seconds) emission, whose luminosity decays in time as a
power-law. While the decay rate is similar for all GRBs (i.e. $L_{LAT}\propto
t^{-1.2}$), the normalisation spans about two orders of magnitude in
luminosity. However, after re-normalising the luminosities to the prompt
energetics $E_{iso}$ the light curves overlap. We consider the scenario in
which the temporally extended LAT emission is dominated by synchrotron
radiation from electrons accelerated at the forward external shock. According
to this model, at high-energies (i.e. above the typical synchrotron
frequencies) a small dispersion of the $E_{iso}$-normalised light curves is
expected. The fact that the LAT temporally extended emission follows this
behaviour reinforces its interpretation in terms of afterglow radiation from
external shocks. Assuming this scenario, we argue that the parameters
$\epsilon_e$ and $\eta_\gamma$ (i.e., the fraction of shock-dissipated energy
gained by the electrons, and the efficiency of the mechanism producing the
prompt radiation, respectively) must be narrowly distributed.

Globally, fast rotating galaxies with significant recent in situ star formation
are dominated by $z$-tubes. Slow rotators with recent mergers have significant
box orbit and $x$-tube components. Rotation, quantified by the
$\lambda_R$-parameter often originates from streaming motion of stars on
$z$-tubes but sometimes from figure rotation. The observed anti-correlation of
$h_3$ and $V_0 / \sigma$ in rotating galaxies can be connected to a dissipative
formation history leading to high $z$-tube fractions. For galaxies with recent
mergers in situ formed stars, accreted stars and dark matter particles populate
similar orbits. Dark matter particles have isotropic velocity dispersions.
Accreted stars are typically radially biased ($\beta \approx 0.2 - 0.4$). In
situ stars become tangentially biased (as low as $\beta \approx -1.0$) if
dissipation was relevant during the late assembly of the galaxy. We discuss the

of the nucleation fraction by comparing two homogeneous samples of nearby field
vs. cluster early type galaxies with uniform Hubble Space Telescope (HST)
coverage. Existing Chandra X-ray Telescope data for both samples yield
complementary information on low-level accretion onto nuclear SMBHs.
Specifically, we report on dual-band (F475W & F850LP) Advanced Camera for

compose the AMUSE-Field Chandra survey, and compare our results against the

two-dimensional light profiles of the field targets to identify and
characterize NSCs, and find a field nucleation fraction of 26% (+17%, -11%; at
the 1-sigma level), consistent with the measured Virgo nucleation fraction of
30% (+17%, -12%), across a comparable mass distribution. Coupled with the
Chandra result that SMBH activity is higher for the field, our findings
indicate that, since the last epoch of star formation, the funneling of gas to
the nuclear regions has been inhibited more effectively for Virgo galaxies,
arguably via ram pressure stripping.

we report numerical simulations demonstrating that such MMR behavior places
important constraints on the disk evolution stage out of which the observed

tend to end up with a 2:1 MMR mostly independent of the disk masses but
low-mass planets (with mass $\leq 30$ $M_{\oplus}$) can have MMRs larger than

dwarf spheroidal and ultra-faint dwarf galaxies-as observed today-do not appear
to follow the well defined pulsation properties shown by those in either the

particularly at `snow-lines' where a gas-phase species freezes out to form ice
grains. Such sharp discontinuities will diffuse out due to the turbulence
suspected to drive angular momentum transport in accretion discs. We
demonstrate that the concentration gradient - in the vicinity of the snow-line
- of a species present outside a snow-line but destroyed inside is strongly
sensitive to the level of turbulent diffusion (provided the chemical and
transport time-scales are decoupled) and provides a direct measurement of the
radial `Schmidt number' (the ratio of the angular momentum transport to radial
turbulent diffusion). Taking as an example the tracer species N$_2$H$^+$, which
is expected to be destroyed inside the CO snow-line (as recently observed in TW
Hya) we show that ALMA observations possess significant angular resolution to
constrain the Schmidt number. Since different turbulent driving mechanisms
predict different Schmidt numbers, a direct measurement of the Schmidt number
in accretion discs would allow inferences about the nature of the turbulence to
be made.

in the Ly$\alpha$ equivalent width (EW). Our multiphase medium consists of
spherically symmetric distributions of cold, dusty clumps embedded within a hot
dust-free medium. We focus on three models from the analysis presented by
Laursen et al. (2013). We find that for a Ly$\alpha$ and UV-continuum point
source, it is possible to find an EW boost $b(\theta,\phi) > 5 \bar{b}$ in a
few per cent of sight lines, where $\bar{b}$ denotes the boost averaged over
all photons. For spatially extended sources this directional dependence
vanishes quickly when the size of the UV emitting region exceeds the mean
distance between cold dusty clumps. Our analysis suggests that directional EW
boosting can occur, and that this is mostly driven by reduced escape fractions
of UV photons (which gives rise to UV-continuum `shadows'), and less due to an
enhanced Ly$\alpha$ escape fraction (or beaming), in certain directions.

tissue architecture investigated in (Matzavinos et al., 2009) in the context of
abdominal tissue flaps that are commonly used for reconstructive surgery. We
apply two-scale convergence methods and unfolding operator techniques to
homogenize the developed microscopic model, which involves different unit-cell

account for different arterial branching patterns.

The encoder merely describes the indices of the few maximal source components,

components based on this information. This scheme turns out to be near-optimal
for the memoryless Gaussian source in the sense of achieving the zero-rate
slope of its distortion-rate function. Motivated by this finding, we then
propose a scheme comprised of iterating the above lossy compressor on an
appropriately transformed version of the difference between the source and its
reconstruction from the previous iteration. The proposed scheme achieves the
rate distortion function of the Gaussian memoryless source (under squared error
distortion) when employed on any finite-variance ergodic source. It further
possesses desirable properties we respectively refer to as infinitesimal
successive refinability, ratelessness, and complete separability. Its storage
and computation requirements are of order no more than $\frac{n^2}{\log^{\beta}
n}$ per source symbol for $\beta>0$ at both the encoder and decoder. Though the
details of its derivation, construction, and analysis differ considerably, we
discuss similarities between the proposed scheme and the recently introduced

signaling networks within individual cells. Connecting the dynamics of these
intracellular networks to the population phenomena they control poses a
considerable challenge because of network complexity and our limited knowledge
of kinetic parameters. However, from physical systems we know that behavioral
changes in the individual constituents of a collectively-behaving system occur
in a limited number of well-defined classes, and these can be described using
simple models. Here we apply such an approach to the emergence of collective
oscillations in cellular populations of the social amoeba Dictyostelium
discoideum. Through direct tests of our model with quantitative in vivo
measurements of single-cell and population signaling dynamics, we show how a
simple model can effectively describe a complex molecular signaling network and
its effects at multiple size and temporal scales. The model predicts novel
noise-driven single-cell and population-level signaling phenomena that we then
experimentally observe. Our results suggest that like physical systems,
collective behavior in biology may be universal and described using simple
mathematical models.

to understand the interplay between cluster and nucleon degrees of freedom.
  Purpose:To study resonances in the $^{18}$O spectrum, populated in
$^{14}$C+$\alpha$ elastic scattering.
  Method: The Thick Target Inverse Kinematics (TTIK) technique was used to
measure the excitation function for the $^{14}$C+$\alpha$ elastic scattering. A
42 MeV $^{14}$C beam was used to populate states of excitation energy up to
14.9 MeV in $^{18}$O. The analysis was performed using a multi-level,
multi-channel R-Matrix approach.
  Results: Detailed spectroscopic information, including spin-parities, partial
$\alpha$- and neutron- decay widths and dimensionless reduced widths, was
obtained for excited states in $^{18}$O between 8 and 14.9 MeV in excitation
energy. Cluster-Nucleon Configuration Interaction Model calculations of the
same quantities are performed and compared to the experimental results.
  Conclusions: Strong fragmentation of large $\alpha$-cluster strengths is
observed in the spectrum of $^{18}$O making the $\alpha$-cluster structure of
$^{18}$O quite different from the pattern of known quasi-rotational bands of
alternating parity that are characteristic of $N=Z$, even-even nuclei like
$^{16}$O and $^{20}$Ne.

in the Seyfert 1 galaxy NGC 4151. The new stellar dynamical mass measurement is
derived by applying an axisymmetric orbit-superposition code to near-infrared
integral field data obtained using adaptive optics with the Gemini NIFS
spectrograph. When our models attempt to fit both the NIFS kinematics and
additional low spatial resolution kinematics, our results depend sensitively on
how chi-squared is computed--probably a consequence of complex bar kinematics
that manifest immediately outside the nuclear region. The most robust results
are obtained when only the high spatial resolution kinematic constraints in the
nuclear region are included in the fit. Our best estimates for the BH mass and
H-band mass-to-light ratio are Mbh~(3.76+/-1.15)E7 Msun (1-sigma error) and
M/L(H-band)~0.34+/-0.03 Msun/Lsun (3-sigma error), respectively (the quoted
errors reflect the model uncertainties). Our BH mass measurement is consistent
with estimates from both reverberation mapping (3.57[+0.45/-0.37]E7 Msun) and
gas kinematics (3.0[+0.75/-2.2]E7 Msun; 1-sigma errors), and our best-fit
mass-to-light ratio is consistent with the photometric estimate of
M/L(H-band)=0.4+/-0.2 Msun/Lsun. The NIFS kinematics give a central bulge
velocity dispersion sigma_c=116+/-3 km/s, bringing this object slightly closer
to the M-sigma relation for quiescent galaxies. Although NGC 4151 is one of
only a few Seyfert 1 galaxies in which it is possible to obtain a direct
dynamical BH mass measurement--and thus, an independent calibration of the
reverberation mapping mass scale--the complex bar kinematics makes it less than
ideally suited for this purpose.

$J_{1}$-$J_{2}$ Heisenberg interactions, and they couple to the itinerant

representation for the local moments and perform a generalized random-phase

in the $\left(\pi,0\right)$ magnetically-ordered state, the spin-wave
excitation at $\left(\pi,\pi\right)$ is pushed to a higher energy due to the
presence of itinerant electrons, which is consistent with a previous study

Booster cycle-rate from 15- to 20-Hz. We find that changing the Booster
cycle-rate to 20-Hz would greatly increase the slip-stacking bucket area, while
potentially requiring greater usage of the Recycler momentum aperture and
additional power dissipation in the RF cavities. In particular, the losses from
RF interference can be reduced by a factor of 4-10 (depending on Booster beam
longitudinal parameters). We discuss the aspect ratio and beam emittance
requirements for efficient slip-stacking in both cycle-rate cases. Using a
different injection scheme can eliminate the need for greater momentum aperture
in the Recycler.

Bhargava and Ho have shown that the average size of the $2$-Selmer group in the

these results, we show that the average size of the $2$-Selmer group in the

the existence of a two-torsion point implies the existence of rational isogeny.
A fundamental quantity attached to a pair of isogenous curves is the Tamagawa
ratio, which measures the relative sizes of the Selmer groups associated to the
isogeny and its dual. Building on previous work in which we considered the
Tamagawa ratio in quadratic twist families, we show that, in the family of all
elliptic curves with a two-torsion point, the Tamagawa ratio is essentially
governed by a normal distribution with mean zero and growing variance.

the edges of $F$ contains a monochromatic copy of $H$. The graph $F$ is Ramsey
$H$-minimal if $F$ is Ramsey for $H$ and there is no proper subgraph $F'$ of
$F$ so that $F'$ is Ramsey for $H$. Burr, Erdos, and Lovasz defined $s(H)$ to
be the minimum degree of $F$ over all Ramsey $H$-minimal graphs $F$. Define
$H_{t,d}$ to be a graph on $t+1$ vertices consisting of a complete graph on $t$
vertices and one additional vertex of degree $d$. We show that $s(H_{t,d})=d^2$
for all values $1<d\le t$; it was previously known that $s(H_{t,1})=t-1$, so it
is surprising that $s(H_{t,2})=4$ is much smaller.
  We also make some further progress on some sparser graphs. Fox and Lin
observed that $s(H)\ge 2\delta(H)-1$ for all graphs $H$, where $\delta(H)$ is
the minimum degree of $H$; Szabo, Zumstein, and Zurcher investigated which
graphs have this property and conjectured that all bipartite graphs $H$ without
isolated vertices satisfy $s(H)=2\delta(H)-1$. Fox, Grinshpun, Liebenau,

isolated vertices satisfy this property. We show that $d$-regular $3$-connected
triangle-free graphs $H$, with one extra technical constraint, satisfy $s(H) =

identified through the BANYAN Bayesian inference method of \citet{2013malo},
which takes into account the position, proper motion, magnitude, color, radial
velocity and parallax (when available) to establish a membership probability.
The derived parameters are compared to Dartmouth Magnetic evolutionary models
and to field stars with the goal to constrain the age of our candidates. We
find that, in general, low-mass stars in our sample are more luminous and have
inflated radii compared to older stars, a trend expected for pre-main sequence
stars. The Dartmouth Magnetic evolutionary models show a good fit to
observations of field K and M stars assuming a magnetic field strength of a few
kG, as typically observed for cool stars. Using the low-mass members of
$\beta$Pictoris moving group, we have re-examined the age inconsistency problem
between Lithium Depletion age and isochronal age (Hertzspring-Russell diagram).
We find that the inclusion of the magnetic field in evolutionary models
increase the isochronal age estimates for the K5V-M5V stars. Using these models
and field strengths, we derive an average isochronal age between 15 and 28 Myr
and we confirm a clear Lithium Depletion Boundary from which an age of
26$\pm$3~Myr is derived, consistent with previous age estimates based on this

For an E$^{-2}$ spectrum the median sensitivity at 90\% C.L. is $\sim 10^{-12}$
TeV$^{-1}$cm$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$ for energies between 1 TeV$-$1 PeV in the northern
sky and $\sim 10^{-11}$ TeV$^{-1}$cm$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$ for energies between 100

additional year of data and the introduction of improved reconstructions
compared to previous publications. In addition, we present the first results
from an all-sky search for extended sources of neutrinos. We update results of
searches for neutrino emission from stacked catalogs of sources, and test five
new catalogs; two of Galactic supernova remnants and three of active galactic
nuclei. In all cases, the data are compatible with the background-only

presented within the framework of the one-dimensional two-layer shallow-water
equations.
  The equations represent four basic physical laws: the theory is developed on
the basis of these laws. Though the first three of the four basic laws are
apparent, the forth basic law has been uncertain. This paper shows first that
this forth basic law can be deduced from the law which is called in this paper
the conservation law of circulation.
  It is then demonstrated that, within the framework of the equations, an
internal bore is represented by a shock satisfying the shock conditions that
follow from the four basic laws. A gravity current can also be treated within
the framework of the equations if the front conditions, i.e. the boundary
conditions to be imposed at the front of the current, are known. Basically, the
front conditions for a gravity current also follow from the four basic laws.
When the gravity current is advancing along a no-slip boundary, however, it is
necessary to take into account the influence of the thin boundary layer formed
on the boundary; this paper describes how this influence can be evaluated.
  It is verified that the theory can satisfactorily explain the behaviour of
internal bores advancing into two stationary layers of fluid. The theory also
provides a formula for the rate of advance of a gravity current along a no-slip
lower boundary; this formula proves to be consistent with some empirical
formulae. In addition, some well-known theoretical formulae on gravity currents
turn out to be obtainable on the basis of the theory.

amplitude measurements $|<x, a_i > |^2$, $i=1,2,...,m$, where $a_i$'s are
over-complete basis vectors, with $m$ at least $3n -2$ to ensure a unique
solution up to a constant phase factor. The quadratic measurement becomes
linear in terms of the rank-one matrix $X = x x^*$. Phase retrieval is then a
rank-one minimization problem subject to linear constraint for which a convex
relaxation based on trace-norm minimization (PhaseLift) has been extensively
studied recently. At $m=O(n)$, PhaseLift recovers with high probability the
rank-one solution. In this paper, we present a precise proxy of rank-one
condition via the difference of trace and Frobenius norms which we call
PhaseLiftOff. The associated least squares minimization with this penalty as
regularization is equivalent to the rank-one least squares problem under a mild
condition on the measurement noise. Stable recovery error estimates are valid
at $m=O(n)$ with high probability. Computation of PhaseLiftOff minimization is
carried out by a convergent difference of convex functions algorithm. In our
numerical example, $a_i$'s are Gaussian distributed. Numerical results show
that PhaseLiftOff outperforms PhaseLift and its nonconvex variant
(log-determinant regularization), and successfully recovers signals near the
theoretical lower limit on the number of measurements without the noise.

continuum observations at 1.2 mm. We predict its submillimetre dust emission
using detailed models that follow SN dust enrichment and destruction and the
equilibrium dust temperature, and obtain a plausible upper limit to the dust
mass produced by a single SN: $m_\mathrm{d,SN} < 0.15$--0.45 M$_\odot$,
depending on the adopted dust optical properties. These upper limits are
smaller than the dust mass deduced for SN 1987A and that predicted by dust
condensation theories, implying that dust produced in SNe are likely to be
subject to reverse shock destruction before being injected into the
interstellar medium. Finally, we provide a recipe for deriving
$m_\mathrm{d,SN}$ from submillimetre observations of young, metal poor objects

that an excited electron-hole pair, originating from the optical transition

electron-hole pairs, although it displays a substantial exchange self-energy

correction in comparison to the difference between renormalized transition

other electron-hole states with a significant optical strength.

influence everything from how governments sell wireless spectrum licenses to
how the major search engines auction off online advertising. There are,
however, some basic problems for which the traditional optimal mechanism design
approach is ill-suited --- either because it makes overly strong assumptions,
or because it advocates overly complex designs. The thesis of this paper is
that approximately optimal mechanisms allow us to reason about fundamental
questions that seem out of reach of the traditional theory.
  This survey has three main parts. The first part describes the approximately
optimal mechanism design paradigm --- how it works, and what we aim to learn by
applying it. The second and third parts of the survey cover two case studies,
where we instantiate the general design paradigm to investigate two basic
questions. In the first example, we consider revenue maximization in a
single-item auction with heterogeneous bidders. Our goal is to understand if
complexity --- in the sense of detailed distributional knowledge --- is an
essential feature of good auctions for this problem, or alternatively if there
are simpler auctions that are near-optimal. The second example considers
welfare maximization with multiple items. Our goal here is similar in spirit:
when is complexity --- in the form of high-dimensional bid spaces --- an
essential feature of every auction that guarantees reasonable welfare? Are
there interesting cases where low-dimensional bid spaces suffice?

following long-term orbital evolution due to planet-planet and planet-star {\it

N-body simulations of the systems consisting of three jupiter-mass planets
taking into account the dynamical tide. The formation rate of the binary
planets is as much as 10% of the systems that undergo orbital crossing and this
fraction is almost independent of the initial stellarcentric semi-major axes of
the planets, while ejection and merging rates sensitively depend on the
semi-major axes. As a result of circularization by the planet-planet dynamical
tide, typical binary separations are a few times the sum of the physical radii
of the planets. After the orbital circularization, the evolution of the binary
system is governed by long-term quasi-static tide. We analytically calculated
the quasi-static tidal evolution in later phase ii). The binary planets first
enter the spin-orbit synchronous state by the planet-planet tide. The
planet-star tide removes angular momentum of the binary motion, eventually
resulting in a collision between the planets. However, we found that the binary
planets survive the tidal decay for main-sequence life time of solar-type stars

These results suggest that the binary planets can be detected by transit

the two- and three-body break-up of 3He are calculated with a variety of
nucleon-nucleon potentials, among which is the AV18 potential, augmented by the
Urbana~IX three-nucleon potential. Most of our results are based on the single
nucleon weak current operator. As a first step, we have tested our calculation
in the case of the mu + 2H -> nu + n + n and mu + 3He -> nu + 3H reactions, for
which theoretical predictions obtained in a comparable framework are available.
Additionally, we have been able to obtain for the first time a realistic
estimate for the total rates of the muon capture reactions on 3He in the
break-up channels: 544 1/s and 154 1/s for the n + d and n + n + p channels,
respectively. Our results have also been compared with the most recent
experimental data, finding a rough agreement for the total capture rates, but
failing to reproduce the differential capture rates.

schemes, both possessing an inherent double replication of data. The two coding
schemes belong to the class of regenerating and locally regenerating codes
respectively, and these two classes are representative of recent advances made
in designing codes for the efficient storage of data in a distributed setting.
In comparison with triple replication, double replication permits a significant
reduction in storage overhead, while delivering good MapReduce performance
under moderate work loads. The two coding solutions under evaluation here, add
only moderately to the storage overhead of double replication, while
simultaneously offering reliability levels similar to that of triple
replication.
  One might expect from the property of inherent data duplication that the
performance of these codes in executing a MapReduce job would be comparable to
that of double replication. However, a second feature of this class of code
comes into play here, namely that under both coding schemes analyzed here,
multiple blocks from the same coded stripe are required to be stored on the
same node. This concentration of data belonging to a single stripe negatively
impacts MapReduce execution times. However, much of this effect can be undone
by simply adding a larger number of processors per node. Further improvements
are possible if one tailors the Map task scheduler to the codes under
consideration. We present both experimental and simulation results that
validate these observations.

ultrarelativistic heavy-ion collisions with respect to a p-p baseline in terms
of the nuclear suppression factor R_AA is one of the key observables to gauge
the density of a hot and dense QCD medium. However, the suppression measured by
R_AA is not a straightforward measure of the medium properties, the value of
the observable also depends on the ratio of quark to gluon jets and on the
slope of the hard parton spectrum, which explains why R_AA is found to be
fairly similar at RHIC and LHC despite the very different dynamics. Measuring
high P_T jets and hadrons at forward rapidity offers the same possibility of
varying medium density, parton mixture and spectral slope without the need to
compare across different sqrt(s) and experiments. In this work, the well-tested
jet quenching Monte-Carlo (MC) framework YaJEM is utilized to compute the
rapidity dependence of R_AA for three test cases.

quantum decoherence, as long as some local measurement has been performed on
the detector to acquire the information of the radiation in it. But unlike

regions in parameter space that are more consistent with the observational
data. In particular, we find that any broad distribution of birth spin periods
with $P_0\lesssim 0.5$ s can fit the data, and that if the alignment angle is
allowed to vary consistently with the torque model, realistic magnetospheric
models are favoured compared to models with classical magneto-dipolar radiation
losses. Assuming that the initial magnetic field is given by a lognormal
distribution, our optimal model has mean strength $\langle\log B_0{\rm

However, there are strong correlations between parameters. This degeneracy in
the parameter space can be broken by an independent estimate of the pulsar
birth rate or by future studies correlating this information with the
population in other observational bands (X-rays and $\gamma$-rays).

related to the inverse dwell time in the diffusive region in the limit

In the opposite limit of a large Thouless energy $E_{\mathrm{Th}}\gg\Delta$, a

further secondary gap, which is around two orders of magnitude smaller compared

a normal cavity connected to two superconductors through ballistic contacts to
a wider range of contact types. We show that the existence of the secondary gap
is not limited to ballistic contacts, but is a more general property of such

existence of a secondary gap to the presence of small transmission eigenvalues

microscopy. We present several aspects of the tip-induced potential on the
two-dimensional electron gas. First, we give methods on how to estimate the
size of the tip-induced potential. Then, a ballistic cavity is formed and
studied as a function of the bias-voltage of the metallic top gates and probed
with the tip-induced potential. It is shown how the potential of the cavity
changes by tuning the system to a regime where conductance quantization in the
constrictions formed by the tip and the top gates occurs. This conductance
quantization leads to a unprecedented rich fringe pattern over the entire
structure. Finally, the effect of electrostatic screening of the metallic top
gates is discussed.

characterize algebraically the corresponding solution manifold by means of
Noether invariants. This constitutes a necessary preliminary step towards the
correct quantization in non-linear cases, where the success of Canonical
Quantization is not guaranteed in general. To achieve this task ""point
symmetries"" of the Lagrangian are generally not enough, and the notion of
contact transformations is in order: the solution manifold can not be in
general parametrized by means of Noether invariants associated with basic point
symmetries. The use of the contact structure given by the Poincar\'e-Cartan
form permits the definition of the symplectic form on the solution manifold,
through some sort of Hamilton-Jacobi transformation. It also provides the
required basic symmetries, realized as Hamiltonian vector fields associated
with global functions on the solution manifold (thus constituting an inverse of
the Noether Theorem), lifted back to the evolution space through the inverse of
this Hamilton-Jacobi mapping. In this framework, solutions and symmetries, as a
whole, are somehow identified and this correspondence is also kept at a
perturbative level. We present non-trivial examples of this interplay between
symmetries and solutions pointing out the usefulness of this mechanism in
approaching the corresponding quantization. In particular, we achieve the
proper generalization of the Heisenberg-Weyl algebra for the non-linear
particle sigma model in $S^3$ within this framework, and notice that a subset
of the classical symmetries corresponding with this quantizing algebra (those
generalizing boosts) are necessarily of non-point character.

changes and is therefore an important activity for software evolution. In
modelbased software development, models are core artifacts, which are often
used to generate essential parts of a software system. Changes to a model can
thus substantially affect different artifacts of a software system. In this
paper, we propose a modelbased approach to impact analysis, in which explicit
impact rules can be specified in a domain specific language (DSL). These impact
rules define consequences of designated UML class diagram changes on software
artifacts and the need of dependent activities such as data evolution. The UML
class diagram changes are identified automatically using model differencing.
The advantage of using explicit impact rules is that they enable the
formalization of knowledge about a product. By explicitly defining this
knowledge, it is possible to create a checklist with hints about development
steps that are (potentially) necessary to manage the evolution. To validate the
feasibility of our approach, we provide results of a case study.

occurs at the frequency $\omega$ when the amplitude of the high-frequency force
is varied. When the system is subjected to an input signal containing

the high-frequency input signal and is called ghost-vibrational resonance. In
both types of resonances, the number of resonances is $N$ and hysteresis occurs
in each resonance region. There are some similarities and differences in these
two resonance phenomena. We report in detail the influence of the role of

In the ideal case, porting a GF application grammar to a new language would
only require introducing the domain lexicon - translation equivalents that are
interlinked via common abstract terms. While it is possible for a highly
restricted CNL, developing and porting a less restricted CNL requires above
average linguistic knowledge about the particular language, and above average
GF experience. Specifying a lexicon is mostly straightforward in the case of
nouns (incl. multi-word units), however, verbs are the most complex category
(in terms of both inflectional paradigms and argument structure), and adding
them to a GF application grammar is not a straightforward task. In this paper
we are focusing on verbs, investigating the possibility of creating a
multilingual FrameNet-based GF library. We propose an extension to the current

similarly as was found in avalanches in jammed systems. In contrast to the
similar Ising spin-glass (Sherrington-Kirkpatrick) studied previously, we find
that avalanches are not distributed with a scale-free power law, but rather
have a typical size which scales with the system size. We also observe that the
Hessians of the spin-glass minima are not part of standard random matrix
ensembles as the lowest eigenvector has a fractal support.

the point group and of time reversal. We show that for instability wave vectors
along the diagonals all possible basis functions are either fine-tuned (i.e.,
obey restrictions beyond the requirements of symmetry) or break time reversal
symmetry and thus describe flux states. For instability wave vectors along the
crystalline axes, corresponding to the observed case in underdoped cuprates,
there are only three representations with $A_1$, $B_1$, and $E$ symmetry which
do not break time reversal symmetry in the general case. We suggest that one of

achieved (several order of magnitude more efficient than the free-standing

forbidden by the localization of the nonlinear quadratic response on the
two-dimensional atomic layered material, but it stems from the interplay
between the two-dimensional planar geometry of the nonlinear medium and the

called \emph{primitive} if no proper divisor of $L$ is a covering number. Sun
constructed an infinite set $\mathcal L$ of primitive covering numbers, and he
conjectured that every primitive covering number must satisfy a certain
condition. In this paper, for a given $L\in \mathcal L$, we derive a formula
that gives the exact number of coverings that have $L$ as the least common
multiple of the set $M$ of moduli, under certain restrictions on $M$.
Additionally, we disprove Sun's conjecture by constructing an infinite set of

reuse towards increasing the offered throughput is considered. Focusing on the
forward link, the goal is to employ multi-antenna signal processing techniques,
namely linear precoding, to manage the inter-beam interferences. In this
context, fundamental practical limitations, namely the rigid framing structure
of satellite communication standards and the on-board per-antenna power
constraints, are herein considered. Therefore, the concept of optimal frame
based precoding under per-antenna constraints, is discussed. This consists in
precoding the transmit signals without changing the underlying framing
structure of the communication standard. In the present work, the connection of
the frame based precoding problem with the generic signal processing problem of
conveying independent sets of common data to distinct groups of users is
established. This model is known as physical layer multicasting to multiple
co-channel groups. Building on recent results, the weighted fair per-antenna
power constrained multigroup multicast precoders are employed for frame based
precoding. The throughput performance of these solutions is compared to
multicast aware heuristic precoding methods over a realistic multibeam

designing a fully automated latent fingerprint matcher is a very challenging
task as it needs to address many challenging issues including the separation of
overlapping structured patterns over the partial and poor quality latent
fingerprint image, and finding a match against a large background database that
would have different resolutions. Currently there is no fully automated latent
fingerprint matcher available to the public and most literature reports have
utilized a specialized latent fingerprint matcher COTS3 which is not accessible

target to develop a fully automated latent matcher for adaptive detection of
the region of interest and robust matching of latent prints. Unlike the
manually conducted matching procedure, the proposed latent matcher can run like
a sealed black box without any manual intervention. This matcher consists of
the following two modules: (i) the dictionary learning-based region of interest
(ROI) segmentation scheme; and (ii) the genetic algorithm-based minutiae set
matching unit. Experimental results on NIST SD27 latent fingerprint database
demonstrates that the proposed matcher outperforms the currently public

this work, we identify the exact sign structure for the bipartite Hubbard model
at an arbitrary strength of the on-site Coulomb repulsion $U$. This general
sign structure naturally reproduces the conventional fermion signs in the small
$U$ limit, and the phase string signs of the $t$-$J$ model in the large $U$
limit. We focus on the half-filling case as an example to illustrate why such a
generic sign structure is important to understand the transition from the
weakly correlated Fermi liquid regime to the strongly correlated Mott regime.
In particular, we show that an electron fractionalization scheme with emergent
partons and mutual Chern-Simons gauge fields provides a suitable framework to
accurately handle the singular sign structure in two dimensions. A ground state
ansatz at half-filling with incorporating the sign structure and the specific
electron fractionalization is also proposed.

produce a flux of stable final state particles, e.g. high energy neutrinos.
These neutrinos can be detected with IceCube, a cubic-kilometer sized Cherenkov
detector. Given IceCube's large field of view, a characteristic anisotropy of
the additional neutrino flux is expected. In this paper we describe a multipole
method to search for such a large-scale anisotropy in IceCube data. This method
uses the expansion coefficients of a multipole expansion of neutrino arrival
directions and incorporates signal-specific weights for each expansion
coefficient. We apply the technique to a high-purity muon neutrino sample from
the Northern Hemisphere. The final result is compatible with the
null-hypothesis. As no signal was observed, we present limits on the
self-annihilation cross-section averaged over the relative velocity
distribution $<\sigma v>$ down to $1.9\cdot
10^{-23}\,\mathrm{cm}^3\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ for a dark matter particle mass of
$700\,\mathrm{GeV}$ to $1000\,\mathrm{GeV}$ and direct annihilation into
$\nu\bar{\nu}$. The resulting exclusion limits come close to exclusion limits
from $\gamma$-ray experiments, that focus on the outer Galactic halo, for high
dark matter masses of a few TeV and hard annihilation channels.

the dark matter is composed by spinless-ultra-light particles which can be
described by a scalar field. This model is an alternative model to the
$\Lambda$-cold dark matter paradigm, and therefore should be studied at
galactic and cosmological scales. Dwarf spheroidal galaxies have been very
useful when studying any dark matter theory, because the dark matter dominates
their dynamics. In this paper we study the Sextans dwarf spheroidal galaxy,
embedded in a scalar field dark matter halo. We explore how the dissolution
time-scale of the stellar substructures in Sextans, constrain the mass, and the
self-interacting parameter of the scalar field dark matter boson. We find that
for masses in the range $(0.12< m_{\phi}<8) \times10^{-22}$~eV, scalar field
dark halos without self-interaction would have cores large enough to explain
the longevity of the stellar substructures in Sextans, and small enough mass to
be compatible with dynamical limits. If the self-interacting parameter is
distinct to zero, then the mass of the boson could be as high as
$m_{\phi}\approx2\times10^{-21}$~eV, but it would correspond to an unrealistic
low mass fot the Sextans dark matter halo . Therefore, the Sextans dwarf galaxy
could be embedded in a scalar field/BEC dark matter halo with a preferred
self-interacting parameter equal to zero.

a comparative study of the gaseous-phase and stellar-phase metallicities in the

not find a significant difference in the metallicity (neither gaseous nor

formation process of seed black holes and track galactic evolution to the
present day. Observations of extreme mass ratio inspirals will allow us to
explore galactic centers in the local universe, as well as providing tests of
General Relativity and constraining the value of Hubble's constant. The
detection of compact binaries in our own galaxy may allow us to model stellar

a stochastic background would help us to constrain cosmological models.
However, all of this depends on our ability to not only resolve sources and
carry out parameter estimation, but also on our ability to define an optimal
data analysis strategy. In this presentation, I will examine the challenges

October 2009 and April 2011. Analysis of this data sample using the latest
improvements in the MAGIC stereoscopic software provided an unprecedented
precision of spectral and night-by-night light curve determination at gamma
rays. We derived a differential spectrum with a single instrument from 50 GeV
up to almost 30 TeV with 5 bins per energy decade. At low energies, MAGIC
results, combined with Fermi-LAT data, show a flat and broad Inverse Compton
peak. The overall fit to the data between 1 GeV and 30 TeV is not well
described by a log-parabola function. We find that a modified log-parabola
function with an exponent of 2.5 instead of 2 provides a good description of
the data ($\chi^2=35/26$). Using systematic uncertainties of red the MAGIC and
Fermi-LAT measurements we determine the position of the Inverse Compton peak to
be at (53 $\pm$ 3stat + 31syst -13syst) GeV, which is the most precise
estimation up to date and is dominated by the systematic effects. There is no
hint of the integral flux variability on daily scales at energies above 300 GeV
when systematic uncertainties are included in the flux measurement. We consider
three state- of-the-art theoretical models to describe the overall spectral
energy distribution of the Crab Nebula. The constant B-field model cannot
satisfactorily reproduce the VHE spectral measurements presented in this work,
having particular difficulty reproducing the broadness of the observed IC peak.
Most probably this implies that the assumption of the homogeneity of the
magnetic field inside the nebula is incorrect. On the other hand, the
time-dependent 1D spectral model provides a good fit of the new VHE results
when considering a 80 {\mu}G magnetic field. However, it fails to match the
data when including the morphology of the nebula at lower wavelengths.

observations. We select red clump stars for which accurate distances, radial
velocities, and metallicities have been measured. Combined with data from the
2MASS and UCAC catalogues, we build a sample of 4600 red clump stars within a
cylinder of 500 pc radius oriented in the direction of the South Galactic Pole,
in the range of 200 pc to 2000 pc distances. We deduce the vertical force and
the total mass density distribution up to 2 kpc away from the Galactic plane by
fitting a distribution function depending explicitly on three isolating
integrals of the motion in a separable potential locally representing the
Galactic one with four free parameters. Because of the deep extension of our
sample, we can determine nearly independently the dark matter mass density and
the baryonic disc surface mass density. We find (i) at 1kpc Kz/(2piG) = 68.5 pm
1.0 Msun/pc2, and (ii) at 2 kpc Kz/(2piG) = 96.9 pm 2.2 Msun/pc2. Assuming the
solar Galactic radius at R0 = 8.5 kpc, we deduce the local dark matter density
rhoDM (z=0) = 0.0143 pm 0.0011Msun pc3 = 0.542 pm 0.042 Gev/cm3 and the
baryonic surface mass density Sigma = 44.4 pm 4.1 Msun/pc2 . Our results are in
agreement with previously published Kz determinations up to 1 kpc, while the
extension to 2 kpc shows some evidence for an unexpectedly large amount of dark
matter. A flattening of the dark halo of order 0.8 can produce such a high
local density in combination with a circular velocity of 240 km/s . Another
explanation, allowing for a lower circular velocity, could be the presence of a
secondary dark component, a very thick disc resulting either from the deposit
of dark matter from the accretion of multiple small dwarf galaxies, or from the
presence of an effective phantom thick disc in the context of effective
galactic-scale modifications of gravity.

attributes drawn from a general compact space and edges between two nodes are
randomly generated and labeled according to some unknown distribution as a
function of their latent attributes. Our goal is then to infer the edge label
distributions from a partially observed network. We propose a computationally
efficient spectral algorithm and show it allows for asymptotically correct
inference when the average node degree could be as low as logarithmic in the

specific constant threshold, we show that no algorithm can achieve better

is a characteristic feature of quantum mechanics, which lies at the root of a
number of nonclassical phenomena, such as uncertainty relations, wave--particle
dual behavior, Bell-inequality violation, and contextuality. However, no
intuitive criterion is available for determining the compatibility of even two
(generalized) observables, despite the overarching importance of this problem
and intensive efforts of many researchers. Here we introduce an information
theoretic paradigm together with an intuitive geometric picture for decoding
incompatible observables, starting from two simple ideas: Every observable can
only provide limited information and information is monotonic under data
processing. By virtue of quantum estimation theory, we introduce a family of
universal criteria for detecting incompatible observables and a natural measure
of incompatibility, which are applicable to arbitrary number of arbitrary
observables. Based on this framework, we derive a family of universal
measurement uncertainty relations, provide a simple information theoretic
explanation of quantitative wave--particle duality, and offer new perspectives
for understanding Bell nonlocality, contextuality, and quantum precision limit.

(ODEs) are, by now, an established tool for bifurcation analysis in dynamical
systems theory as well as across almost all natural and engineering sciences.
Although several excellent standard software packages are available for ODEs,
there are - for good reasons - no standard numerical continuation toolboxes
available for partial differential equations (PDEs), which cover a broad range
of different classes of PDEs automatically. A natural approach to this problem
is to look for efficient gluing computation approaches, with independent
components developed by researchers in numerical analysis, dynamical systems,
scientific computing and mathematical modelling. In this paper, we shall study
several elliptic PDEs (Lane-Emden-Fowler, Lane-Emden-Fowler with microscopic
force, Caginalp) via the numerical continuation software pde2path and develop a
gluing component to determine a set of starting solutions for the continuation
by exploting the variational structures of the PDEs. In particular, we solve
the initialization problem of numerical continuation for PDEs via a minimax
algorithm to find multiple unstable solution. Furthermore, for the Caginalp
system, we illustrate the efficient gluing link of pde2path to the underlying
mesh generation and the FEM MatLab pdetoolbox. Even though the approach works
efficiently due to the high-level programming language and without developing
any new algorithms, we still obtain interesting bifurcation diagrams and
directly applicable conclusions about the three elliptic PDEs we study, in
particular with respect to symmetry-breaking. In particular, we show for a
modified Lane-Emden-Fowler equation with an asymmetric microscopic force, how a
fully connected bifurcation diagram splits up into C-shaped isolas on which
localized pattern deformation appears towards two different regimes.

  Our main observation is that this stratification reflects the stratified

surrogate classes. Each surrogate class is formed by applying a variety of
transformations to a randomly sampled 'seed' image patch. In contrast to
supervised network training, the resulting feature representation is not class
specific. It rather provides robustness to the transformations that have been
applied during training. This generic feature representation allows for
classification results that outperform the state of the art for unsupervised
learning on several popular datasets (STL-10, CIFAR-10, Caltech-101,
Caltech-256). While such generic features cannot compete with class specific
features from supervised training on a classification task, we show that they
are advantageous on geometric matching problems, where they also outperform the
SIFT descriptor.

We show that recursive constructions of first-return maps on a suitable

the elements of the field $K$ that lie in the given interval. The
renormalization process is organized by a graph. There are ten distinct
renormalization scenarios corresponding to as many closed circuits in the

intermediate maps undergoing, as the parameter varies, infinitely many
bifurcations. Our proofs rely on computer-assistance.

constrain the total bombardment mass experienced by the satellite since its

small angles. Moreover, for small system sizes we show that upon decreasing the
restriction angle, the kind of the transition to polar collective motion
changes from continuous to discontinuous. Thus, an apparent tricritical point
is identified and calculated analytically. We also find that at very small
interaction angles the polar ordered phase becomes unstable with respect to the
apolar phase. We show that the mean-field kinetic theory permits stationary
nematic states below a restriction angle of $0.681 \pi$. We calculate the
critical noise, at which the disordered state bifurcates to a nematic state,
and find that it is always smaller than the threshold noise for the transition
from disorder to polar order. The disordered-nematic transition features two
tricritical points: At low and high restriction angle the transition is
discontinuous but continuous at intermediate $\alpha$. We generalize our
results to systems that show fragmentation into more than two groups and obtain
scaling laws for the transition lines and the corresponding tricritical points.
A novel numerical method to evaluate the nonlinear Fredholm integral equation
for the stationary distribution function is also presented.

  propagation","5 pages, 3 figures",,,,"math.NA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We develop a method for numerical time-domain wave propagation based on the
model order reduction approach. The method is built with high-performance
computing (HPC) implementation in mind that implies a high level of parallelism
and greatly reduced communication requirements compared to the traditional
high-order finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) methods. The approach is
inherently multiscale, with a reference fine grid model being split into
subdomains. For each subdomain the coarse scale reduced order models (ROMs) are
precomputed off-line in a parallel manner. The ROMs approximate the
Neumann-to-Dirichlet (NtD) maps with high (spectral) accuracy and are used to
couple the adjacent subdomains on the shared boundaries. The on-line part of
the method is an explicit time stepping with the coupled ROMs. To lower the
on-line computation cost the reduced order spatial operator is sparsified by
transforming to a matrix Stieltjes continued fraction (S-fraction) form. The
on-line communication costs are also reduced due to the ROM NtD map
approximation properties. Another source of performance improvement is the time
step length. Properly chosen ROMs substantially improve the
Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy (CFL) condition. This allows the CFL time step to
approach the Nyquist limit, which is typically unattainable with traditional
schemes that have the CFL time step much smaller than the Nyquist sampling
rate.

transition rates to construct the mean-field dynamical equations. We

the temperature dependence of the dynamic total magnetization to find the
dynamic compensation points as well as to determine the type of behavior. We
also investigate the effect of a crystal-field interaction and the exchange
couplings between the nearest-neighbor pairs of spins on the compensation
phenomenon and construct the phase diagrams in four different planes. The
dynamic phase diagrams contain paramagnetic (P), ferromagnetic (F), the
antiferromagnetic (AF), and two coexistence or mixed phase regions, namely, the
F + P and AF + P that strongly depend on interaction parameters. The system
also exhibits the compensation temperatures, or the N-, P-, Q-, S- type

W-type behaviors, which this result is compared with some experimental works

be the difference operators with respect to $x$ and $y$. A rational function
$f(x,y)$ is called summable if there exist rational functions $g(x,y)$ and
$h(x,y)$ such that $f(x,y)=\Delta_x g(x,y) + \Delta_y h(x,y)$. Recently, Chen
and Singer presented a method for deciding whether a rational function is
summable. To implement their method in the sense of algorithms, we need to
solve two problems. The first is to determine the shift equivalence of two
bivariate polynomials. We solve this problem by presenting an algorithm for
computing the dispersion sets of any two bivariate polynomials. The second is
to solve a univariate difference equation in an algebraically closed field. By
considering the irreducible factorization of the denominator of $f(x,y)$ in a
general field, we present a new criterion which requires only finding a
rational solution of a bivariate difference equation. This goal can be achieved
by deriving a universal denominator of the rational solutions and a degree
bound on the numerator. Combining these two algorithms, we can decide the
summability of a bivariate rational function.
