cohesion (which manifests as a line tension) and dipole-dipole repulsion which
are observed in physical systems including ferrofluids in Hele-Shaw cells and
Langmuir layers. When the dipolar repulsion is sufficiently strong, domains
undergo forked branching reminiscent of viscous fingering. A known difficulty
with these models is that the energy associated with dipole-dipole interactions
is singular at small distances. Following previous work, we demonstrate how to
ameliorate this singularity and show that in the macroscopic limit, only the
relative scale of the microscopic details of a system are relevant, and develop
an expression for the system energy that depends only on a generalized line
tension, {\Lambda}, that in turn depends logarithmically on that scale. We
conduct numerical studies that use energy minimization to find equilibrium
states. Following the subcritical bifurcations from the circle, we find a few
highly symmetric stable shapes, but nothing that resembles the observed
diversity of experimental and dynamically simulated domains. The application of
a weak random background to the energy landscape stabilizes a sm\""org\r{a}sbord
of domain morphologies recovering the diversity observed experimentally. With
this technique, we generate a large sample of qualitatively realistic shapes
and use them to create an empirical model for extracting {\Lambda} using only a
shape's perimeter and morphology with high accuracy.

electromagnetic fields, giving rise to distinctive and potentially detectable
electromagnetic signatures. In this paper, we study such interactions for
far-field gravitational radiation using the 1+3 approach to relativity.
Linearised equations for the electromagnetic field on perturbed Minkowski space
are derived and solved analytically. The inverse Gertsenshtein conversion of
gravitational waves in a static electromagnetic field is rederived, and the
resultant electromagnetic radiation is shown to be significant for highly
magnetised pulsars in compact binary systems. We also obtain a variety of
nonlinear interference effects for interacting gravitational and
electromagnetic waves, although wave-wave resonances previously described in
the literature are absent when the electric-magnetic self-interaction is taken
into account. The fluctuation and amplification of electromagnetic energy flux
as the gravitational wave strength increases towards the
gravitational-electromagnetic frequency ratio is a possible signature of
gravitational radiation from extended astrophysical sources.

relationship that corroborates a fundamental assumption in recent related
works: according the number of BS antennas $N$ grows, the product of the
small-scale fading channel matrix with its conjugate transpose tends to a
scaled identity, with a variability measure inversely proportional to $N$.
Furthermore, analysis of the Massive MIMO system downlink is carried out from a
bit-error-rate (BER) performance viewpoint, including some realistic adverse
effects, such as interference from neighboring cells, channel estimation errors
due to background thermal noise, and pilot contamination, which was recently
shown to be the only impairment that remains in the MIMO multicell system with

transformed to new point clouds embedded in $\mathbb{R}^n$ by
Laplace-Beltrami(LB) eigenmap using the $n$ leading eigenvalues and
corresponding eigenfunctions of LB operator defined intrinsically on the

original manifolds. Then we design computational models and algorithms for
registration of the transformed point clouds in distribution/probability form
based on the optimal transport theory which provides both generality and
flexibility to handle general point clouds setting. Our methods use robust
sliced-Wasserstein distance, which is as the average of projected Wasserstein
distance along different directions, and incorporate a rigid transformation to
handle ambiguities introduced by the Laplace-Beltrami eigenmap. By going from
smaller $n$, which provides a quick and robust registration (based on coarse
scale features) as well as a good initial guess for finer scale registration,
to a larger $n$, our method provides an efficient, robust and accurate approach

alloreactivity to minor histocompatibility antigens (mHA) presented by the HLA
in each donor-recipient pair (DRP) undergoing stem cell transplantation (SCT).
Whole exome sequencing has demonstrated extensive nucleotide sequence variation
in HLA-matched DRP. Non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (nsSNPs) in
the GVH direction (polymorphisms present in recipient and absent in donor) were
identified in 4 HLA-matched related and 5 unrelated DRP. The nucleotide
sequence flanking each SNP was obtained utilizing the ANNOVAR software package.
All possible nonameric-peptides encoded by the non-synonymous SNP were then
interrogated in-silico for their likelihood to be presented by the HLA class I
molecules in individual DRP, using the Immune-Epitope Database (IEDB) SMM
algorithm. The IEDB-SMM algorithm predicted a median 18,396 peptides/DRP which
bound HLA with an IC50 of <500nM, and 2254 peptides/DRP with an IC50 of <50nM.
Unrelated donors generally had higher numbers of peptides presented by the HLA.
A similarly large library of presented peptides was identified when the data
was interrogated using the Net MHCPan algorithm. These peptides were uniformly
distributed in the various organ systems. The bioinformatic algorithm presented
here demonstrates that there may be a high level of minor histocompatibility
antigen variation in HLA-matched individuals, constituting an HLA-specific
alloreactivity potential. These data provide a possible explanation for how
relatively minor adjustments in GVHD prophylaxis yield relatively similar
outcomes in HLA matched and mismatched SCT recipients.

Moreover, we show that the deviations from the Wiedemann-Franz law are

statistical learning problems where the data is generated according to some
unknown distribution $\mathsf{P}$ and returns a hypothesis $f$ chosen from a
fixed class $\mathcal{F}$ with small loss $\ell$. In the parametric setting,
depending upon $(\ell, \mathcal{F},\mathsf{P})$ ERM can have slow
$(1/\sqrt{n})$ or fast $(1/n)$ rates of convergence of the excess risk as a
function of the sample size $n$. There exist several results that give
sufficient conditions for fast rates in terms of joint properties of $\ell$,
$\mathcal{F}$, and $\mathsf{P}$, such as the margin condition and the Bernstein
condition. In the non-statistical prediction with expert advice setting, there
is an analogous slow and fast rate phenomenon, and it is entirely characterized
in terms of the mixability of the loss $\ell$ (there being no role there for
$\mathcal{F}$ or $\mathsf{P}$). The notion of stochastic mixability builds a
bridge between these two models of learning, reducing to classical mixability
in a special case. The present paper presents a direct proof of fast rates for
ERM in terms of stochastic mixability of $(\ell,\mathcal{F}, \mathsf{P})$, and
in so doing provides new insight into the fast-rates phenomenon. The proof
exploits an old result of Kemperman on the solution to the general moment
problem. We also show a partial converse that suggests a characterization of
fast rates for ERM in terms of stochastic mixability is possible.

scattering in weakly absorbing, cold paramagnetic systems. Kinetic neutron
energy is removed in constant decrements determined by the Zeeman energy of
paramagnetic atoms or ions in an external magnetic field, or by zero-field
level splittings in magnetic molecules. Analytical solutions of the stationary
neutron transport equation are given using inelastic neutron scattering cross
sections derived in an appendix. They neglect any inelastic process except the
paramagnetic scattering and hence still underestimate very-cold neutron
densities. Molecular oxygen with its triplet ground state appears particularly
promising, notably as a host in fully deuterated oxygen-clathrate hydrate, or
more exotically, in dry oxygen-He4 van der Waals clusters. At a neutron
temperature about 6 K, for which neutron conversion to ultra-cold neutrons by
single-phonon emission in pure superfluid He4 works best, conversion rates due
to paramagnetic scattering in the clathrate are found to be a factor 9 larger.
While in conversion the neutron imparts only a single energy quantum to the
medium, the multi-step paramagnetic cooling cascade leads to further strong
enhancements of very-cold neutron densities, e.g., by a factor 14 (57) for an
initial neutron temperature of 30 K (100 K), for the moderator held at about
1.3 K. Due to a favorable Bragg cutoff of the oxygen-clathrate the
cascade-cooling can take effect in a moderator with linear extensions smaller
than a meter. The paramagnetic cooling mechanism may offer benefits in novel
intense sources of very cold neutrons and for enhancing production of
ultra-cold neutrons.

explicitly correlated Gaussian functions and the global vector representation.
The integrals of the electric transition dipole moment are derived
corresponding to these basis functions in both the length and the velocity
representation. The complete derivation and the calculations are performed in
laboratory-fixed Cartesian coordinates without relying on coordinates which
separate the center of mass from the translationally invariant degrees of
freedom. The effect of the overall motion is eliminated via translationally
invariant integral expressions. As a numerical example the electric transition
dipole moment is calculated between two rovibronic levels of the H2 molecule
assignable to the lowest rovibrational states of the X ^1Sigma^+_g and B
^1Sigma^+_u electronic states in the clamped-nuclei framework. This is the

possess tertiary companions. Excluding the triples, the models reproduce the
stellar masses to better than ~10% in the H-R diagram, down to 0.5 Msun, below
which the current sample is fully contaminated by tertiaries. We consider
several mechanisms by which a tertiary might cause changes in the EB properties
and thus corrupt the agreement with stellar model predictions. We show that the
energies of the tertiary orbits are comparable to that needed to potentially
explain the scatter in the EB properties through injection of heat, perhaps
involving tidal interaction. It seems from the evidence at hand that this
mechanism, however it operates in detail, has more influence on the surface
properties of the stars than on their internal structure, as the lithium
abundances are broadly in good agreement with model predictions. The EBs that
are members of young clusters appear individually coeval to within 20%, but
collectively show an apparent age spread of ~50%, suggesting true age spreads

propose two new NoC structures using bi-directional links for the performance
optimization. In particular, we propose a flit-level speedup scheme to enhance

  Support Vector Regression Modeling Framework",,,"10.1016/j.ijepes.2014.06.010",,"cs.LG stat.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Highly accurate interval forecasting of electricity demand is fundamental to
the success of reducing the risk when making power system planning and
operational decisions by providing a range rather than point estimation. In
this study, a novel modeling framework integrating bivariate empirical mode
decomposition (BEMD) and support vector regression (SVR), extended from the
well-established empirical mode decomposition (EMD) based time series modeling
framework in the energy demand forecasting literature, is proposed for interval
forecasting of electricity demand. The novelty of this study arises from the
employment of BEMD, a new extension of classical empirical model decomposition
(EMD) destined to handle bivariate time series treated as complex-valued time
series, as decomposition method instead of classical EMD only capable of
decomposing one-dimensional single-valued time series. This proposed modeling
framework is endowed with BEMD to decompose simultaneously both the lower and
upper bounds time series, constructed in forms of complex-valued time series,
of electricity demand on a monthly per hour basis, resulting in capturing the
potential interrelationship between lower and upper bounds. The proposed
modeling framework is justified with monthly interval-valued electricity demand
data per hour in Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Maryland Interconnection, indicating
it as a promising method for interval-valued electricity demand forecasting.

of reasons. They are ubiquitous throughout the course of a person's life, and
face recognition is crucial for daily social interaction. Faces are also unlike
any other stimulus class in terms of certain physical stimulus characteristics.
Furthermore, faces have been empirically found to elicit certain characteristic
behavioral phenomena, which are widely held to be evidence of ""holistic""
processing of faces. However, little is known about the neural mechanisms
underlying such holistic face processing. In other words, for the processing of
faces by the primate visual system, the input and output characteristics are
relatively well known, but the internal neural computations are not. The main
aim of this work is to further the fundamental understanding of what causes the
visual processing of faces to be different from that of objects. In this
computational modeling work, we show that a single factor - ""neural tuning
size"" - is able to account for three key phenomena that are characteristic of
face processing, namely the Composite Face Effect (CFE), Face Inversion Effect
(FIE) and Whole-Part Effect (WPE). Our computational proof-of-principle
provides specific neural tuning properties that correspond to the
poorly-understood notion of holistic face processing, and connects these neural
properties to psychophysical behavior. Overall, our work provides a unified and
parsimonious theoretical account for the disparate empirical data on
face-specific processing, deepening the fundamental understanding of face
processing.

important classes of linear codes that have been extensively studied due to

codes over Galois rings are studied in terms of the ideals in the group ring
${\rm GR}(p^r,s)[G]$, where $G$ is a finite abelian group and ${\rm GR}(p^r,s)$

number of such self-dual codes is established. In the case where
$\gcd(|G|,p)=1$, the number of self-dual abelian codes in ${\rm GR}(p^r,s)[G]$
is completely and explicitly determined. Applying known results on cyclic codes
of length $p^a$ over ${\rm GR}(p^2,s)$, an explicit formula for the number of
self-dual abelian codes in ${\rm GR}(p^2,s)[G]$ are given, where the Sylow
$p$-subgroup of $G$ is cyclic. Subsequently, the characterization and

established. The analogous results for self-dual and complementary dual cyclic

Hirschhorn

They also conjectured that $\overline{p}(40n+35)\equiv 0 \pmod{40}$ for $n\geq
0$. Chen and Xia proved this conjecture by using the $(p,k)$-parametrization of
theta functions given by Alaca, Alaca and Williams. In this paper, we show that
$\overline{p}(5n)\equiv (-1)^{n}\overline{p}(4\cdot 5n) \pmod{5}$ for $n \geq
0$ and $\overline{p}(n)\equiv (-1)^{n}\overline{p}(4n)\pmod{8}$ for $n \geq 0$
by using the relation of the generating function of $\overline{p}(5n)$ modulo
$5$ found by Treneer and the $2$-adic expansion of the generating function of
$\overline{p}(n)$ due to Mahlburg. As a consequence, we deduce that
$\overline{p}(4^k(40n+35))\equiv 0 \pmod{40}$ for $n,k\geq 0$. Furthermore,
applying the Hecke operator on $\phi(q)^3$ and the fact that $\phi(q)^3$ is a
Hecke eigenform, we obtain an infinite family of congrences $\overline{p}(4^k
\cdot5\ell^2n)\equiv 0 \pmod{5}$, where $k\ge 0$ and $\ell$ is a prime such
that $\ell\equiv3 \pmod{5}$ and $\left(\frac{-n}{\ell}\right)=-1$. Moreover, we
show that $\overline{p}(5^{2}n)\equiv \overline{p}(5^{4}n) \pmod{5}$ for $n \ge
0$. So we are led to the congruences
$\overline{p}\big(4^k5^{2i+3}(5n\pm1)\big)\equiv 0 \pmod{5}$ for $n, k, i\ge
0$. In this way, we obtain various Ramanujan-type congruences for
$\overline{p}(n)$ modulo $5$ such as $\overline{p}(45(3n+1))\equiv 0 \pmod{5}$
and $\overline{p}(125(5n\pm 1))\equiv 0 \pmod{5}$ for $n\geq 0$.

All disks are found in nearly perfect Keplerian rotation. We determine accurate

one, DG Tau B, is a deeply embedded object for which CN emission partially
arises from the outflow. With previous determination, this leads to 14 (single)

of anthracnose disease in a bounded domain. The model is a generalization of
the one previously developed in [14]. We use the model to simulate two
different types of control strategies against anthracnose disease. Strategies
that employ chemical fungicides are modeled using a continuous control
function; while strategies that rely on cultivational practices (such as
pruning and removal of mummified fruits) are modeled with a control function
which is discrete in time (though not in space). Under weak smoothness
conditions on parameters we demonstrate the well-posedness of the model by
verifying existence and uniqueness of the solution for given initial
conditions. We also show that the set [0; 1] is positively invariant. We first
study control by pulse strategy only, then analyze the simultaneous use of
continuous and pulse strategies. In each case we specify a cost functional to
be minimized, and we demonstrate the existence of optimal control strategies
that can be evaluated numerically using the gradient method presented in [1].
We discuss the results of numerical simulations both for a spatially averaged
version of the model and for the full model.

Previous studies have mainly focused on the properties of the ground state.
Here we consider a two-dimensional Fermi gas with Rashba spin-orbit coupling

its ground state topological structure is captured by the spin texture, which
is readily measurable in experiments. We show that, when the Zeeman field is
suddenly quenched, dynamical topological phases can be realized. More
specifically, three post-quench dynamical phases can be identified according to
the asymptotic behavior of the order parameter. In the undamped phase, a
persistent oscillation of the order parameter may support a topological Floquet
state with multiple edge states. In the Landau damped phase, the magnitude of
the order parameter approaches a constant via a power-law decay, and this
system can support a dynamical topological phase with a pair of edge states at
the boundary. In the over-damped phase, the order parameter decays to zero
exponentially although the condensate fraction remains finite. These
predictions can be observed in the strong coupling regime of ultracold Fermi
gas.

difficulties we developed a global measure of the information content of an
individual's genome relative to a reference population, which may be used to
assess differences in global genome structure between cases and appropriate
controls. Informally this measure, which we call relative genome information

to test its ability to predict disease risk we used RGI to compare single
nucleotide polymorphism genotypes from two independent samples of women with
early-onset breast cancer with three independent sets of controls. We found
that RGI was significantly elevated in both sets of breast cancer cases in
comparison with all three sets of controls, with disease risk rising sharply
with RGI (odds ratio greater than 12 for the highest percentile RGI).
Furthermore, we found that these differences are not due to associations with
common variants at a small number of disease-associated loci, but rather are
due to the combined associations of thousands of markers distributed throughout
the genome. Our results indicate that the information content of an
individual's genome may be used to measure the risk of a complex disease, and
suggest that early-onset breast cancer has a strongly polygenic basis.

  Systems","20 pages, 11 figures",,,,"nlin.CD","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Entrainment of limit cycles by chaos [1] is discovered numerically through
specially designed unidirectional coupling of two glow discharge-semiconductor
systems. By utilizing the auxiliary system approach [2], it is verified that
the phenomenon is not a chaos synchronization. Simulations demonstrate various
aspects of the chaos appearance in both drive and response systems. Chaotic
control is through the external circuit equation and governs the electrical
potential on the boundary. The expandability of the theory to collectives of
glow discharge systems is discussed, and this increases the potential of
applications of the results. Moreover, the research completes the previous
discussion of the chaos appearance in a glow discharge-semiconductor system
[3].

  Football System in European Countries","6 Pages, 12 Figures, 4 Tables, Accepted in GEM 2014, but rejected due
  to lack of money",,,,"cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper a new heuristic optimization algorithm has been introduced
based on the performance of the major football leagues within each season in EU
countries. The algorithm starts with an initial population including three
different groups of teams: the wealthiest (strongest), the regular, the poorest
(weakest). Each individual of population constitute a football team while each
player is an indication of a player in a post. The optimization can hopefully
occurs when the competition among the teams in all the leagues is imitated as
the strongest teams usually purchase the best players of the regular teams and
in turn, regular teams purchase the best players of the weakest who should
always discover young players instead of buying professionals. It has been
shown that the algorithm can hopefully converge to an acceptable solution
solving various benchmarks. Key words: Heuristic Algorithms

  Evolutionary Methods",,,,,"cs.NE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Initial population plays an important role in heuristic algorithms such as GA
as it help to decrease the time those algorithms need to achieve an acceptable
result. Furthermore, it may influence the quality of the final answer given by
evolutionary algorithms. In this paper, we shall introduce a heuristic method
to generate a target based initial population which possess two mentioned
characteristics. The efficiency of the proposed method has been shown by
presenting the results of our tests on the benchmarks.

future enhancements that will allow tailoring the printed scintillation

  lattices",,,,,"q-fin.EC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Two distinct specifications of single peakedness as currently met in the
relevant literature are singled out and discussed. Then, it is shown that,
under both of those specifications, a voting rule as defined on a bounded
distributive lattice is strategy-proof on the set of all profiles of single
peaked total preorders if and only if it can be represented as an iterated
median of projections and constants, or equivalently as the behaviour of a
certain median tree-automaton. The equivalence of individual and coalitional
strategy-proofness that is known to hold for single peaked domains in bounded
linear orders fails in such a general setting. A related impossibility result
on anonymous coalitionally strategy-proof voting rules is also obtained.

and balance of momentum and energy across moving discontinuities in
inextensible strings and sheets of uniform mass density. The balances are
derived from an action with a time-dependent, non-material boundary, and reduce
to matching of material boundary conditions if the discontinuity is stationary
with respect to the body. I first consider a point discontinuity in a string
and a line discontinuity in a sheet, in the context of classical inertial
motion in three Euclidean dimensions. I briefly comment on line discontinuities
terminating in point discontinuities in a sheet, discontinuous line
discontinuities in a sheet, and an approach to dynamic fracture that treats a
crack tip in a sheet as a time-dependent boundary point. I provide two examples
of general solutions for conservative sheet motions near a line discontinuity.
The approach also enables treatment of actions depending on higher derivatives
of position; I thus derive balances for an \emph{elastica} which are applicable
to moving contact problems.
