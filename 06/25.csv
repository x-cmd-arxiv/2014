previously developed for deforming principal chiral and symmetric space
sigma-models. We also show that the original psu(2,2|4) symmetry is replaced in
the deformed theory by a classical analog of the quantum group U_q(psu(2,2|4))

action is given. The framework used to derive the deformation also enables to
prove that at the hamiltonian level, the ""maximal deformation"" limit
corresponds to an undeformed semi-symmetric space sigma-model with bosonic part
dS_5 x H^5. Finally, we discuss the various freedoms in the construction.

to Bayesian inference on complex models, including model choice. Both
theoretical arguments and simulation experiments indicate, however, that model
posterior probabilities may be poorly evaluated by standard ABC techniques. We
propose a novel approach based on a machine learning tool named random forests
to conduct selection among the highly complex models covered by ABC algorithms.
We thus modify the way Bayesian model selection is both understood and
operated, in that we rephrase the inferential goal as a classification problem,
first predicting the model that best fits the data with random forests and
postponing the approximation of the posterior probability of the predicted MAP
for a second stage also relying on random forests. Compared with earlier
implementations of ABC model choice, the ABC random forest approach offers
several potential improvements: (i) it often has a larger discriminative power
among the competing models, (ii) it is more robust against the number and
choice of statistics summarizing the data, (iii) the computing effort is
drastically reduced (with a gain in computation efficiency of at least fifty),
and (iv) it includes an approximation of the posterior probability of the
selected model. The call to random forests will undoubtedly extend the range of
size of datasets and complexity of models that ABC can handle. We illustrate
the power of this novel methodology by analyzing controlled experiments as well
as genuine population genetics datasets. The proposed methodologies are
implemented in the R package abcrf available on the CRAN.

evolve via continual applications of evolutionary operators such as

conducted by participating humans. Based on this evolutionary perspective, we
generated hypotheses about collective human decision making using agent-based
computer simulations. The hypotheses were then tested through several

evolutionary computation (EC) in non-traditional ways---(1) as a theoretical
framework for reinterpreting the dynamics of idea generation and selection, (2)
as a computational simulation model of collective human decision making
processes, and (3) as a research tool for collecting high-resolution
experimental data of actual collaborative design and decision making from human

channel walls approach the flag, its flapping amplitude decreases roughly in
proportion to the near-wall distance, for both symmetric and asymmetric
channels. Meanwhile, its dominant flapping frequency and mean number of

with fittings to the continuum, we were able to constrain the shell size,
radius, density, temperature and velocity. The detection of the He
recombination lines is compatible with the high temperature gas and requires a
high energy ionizing photon flux, which must be provided by the companion star.
The mass loss rate and wind velocity, necessary to explain the formation of the

parameters of the shell coincide with those of the Weigelt blobs. The dynamics
found for the expanding shell corresponds to matter ejected by $\eta$ Carinae

and a more extended one. Assuming that these two components correspond to two
different temperature components observed in previous H2O and CO studies, the
excitation analysis of the H2O emission suggests that the compact (about 3
arcsec) component is associated with a hot (T~1000 K) gas with densities
~(1-4)x10^5 cm^{-3}, whereas the extended one (10-17 arcsec) traces a warm

multi-packet reception capabilities, where multiple flows are forwarded to the
gateways through node disjoint paths. We explore the issue of allocating flow
on multiple paths, exhibiting both intra- and inter-path interference, in order
to maximize average aggregate flow throughput (AAT) and also provide bounded
packet delay. A distributed flow allocation scheme is proposed where allocation
of flow on paths is formulated as an optimization problem. Through an
illustrative topology it is shown that the corresponding problem is non-convex.
Furthermore, a simple, but accurate model is employed for the average aggregate
throughput achieved by all flows, that captures both intra- and inter-path
interference through the SINR model. The proposed scheme is evaluated through
Ns2 simulations of several random wireless scenarios. Simulation results reveal
that, the model employed, accurately captures the AAT observed in the simulated
scenarios, even when the assumption of saturated queues is removed. Simulation
results also show that the proposed scheme achieves significantly higher AAT,
for the vast majority of the wireless scenarios explored, than the following
flow allocation schemes: one that assigns flows on paths on a round-robin
fashion, one that optimally utilizes the best path only, and another one that
assigns the maximum possible flow on each path. Finally, a variant of the
proposed scheme is explored, where interference for each link is approximated
by considering its dominant interfering nodes only.

thermodynamics in the context of interacting $f(R)$ gravity. We take into
account that the boundary of the universe to be confined by the dynamical
apparent horizon in a flat FRW universe. We study the effective equation of
state, deceleration parameter and GSL in this interaction-framework. We find
that the evolution of the total entropy increases through the interaction term.
As a example, we consider a $f(R)$ gravity with a power-law dependence on the
curvature $R$. Here, we find exact solutions for a model in which the
interaction term is related to the total energy density of matter.

  Acoustic Metasurface",,,"10.1038/ncomms6553",,"cond-mat.mtrl-sci","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Metasurfaces are a family of novel wavefront shaping devices with planar
profile and subwavelength thickness. Acoustic metasurfaces with ultralow
profile yet extraordinary wave manipulating properties would be highly
desirable for improving the performance of many acoustic wave-based
applications. However, designing acoustic metasurfaces with similar
functionality as their electromagnetic counterparts remains challenging with
traditional metamaterial design approaches. Here we present a design and
realization of an acoustic metasurface based on tapered labyrinthine
metamaterials. The demonstrated metasurface can not only can steer an acoustic
beam as expected from the generalized Snell s law, but also exhibits various
unique properties including surface wave conversion, extraordinary
beam-steering and apparent negative refraction through higher-order
diffraction. Such designer acoustic metasurfaces provide a new design
methodology for acoustic signal modulation devices and may be useful for
applications such as beam-steering, surface wave manipulation, high efficiency
sound absorption, acoustic imaging and ultrasound lens design.

proved the existence of a ""complete"" set of seven modular equations (including
three new ones), this paper offers an optimized sieve based on these equations.
A program written in C++ (and given elsewhere) allows then to make a checking

interpretation often relies on inherent grouping of terms into phrases. As
such, we consider the problem of discovering topical phrases of mixed lengths.
Existing work either performs post processing to the inference results of
unigram-based topic models, or utilizes complex n-gram-discovery topic models.
These methods generally produce low-quality topical phrases or suffer from poor
scalability on even moderately-sized datasets. We propose a different approach
that is both computationally efficient and effective. Our solution combines a
novel phrase mining framework to segment a document into single and multi-word
phrases, and a new topic model that operates on the induced document partition.
Our approach discovers high quality topical phrases with negligible extra cost
to the bag-of-words topic model in a variety of datasets including research
publication titles, abstracts, reviews, and news articles.

monoclinic MnWO4 between 10K and 295K. The full dielectric tensor and the
frequency dependence of the orientation of the principal axes have been
determined in the frequency range of the phonons. All infrared-active phonon
modes (7 A_u modes and 8 B_u modes) are unambiguously identified. In particular
the strongest B_u modes have been overlooked in previous studies, in which the
monoclinic symmetry was neglected in the analysis. Using a generalized
Drude-Lorentz model, we determine the temperature dependence of the phonon
parameters, including the orientation of the B_u modes within the ac plane. The
phonon parameters and their temperature dependence have been discussed
controversially in previous studies, which do not include a full polarization
analysis. Our data does not confirm any of the anomalies reported above 20K.
However, in the paramagnetic phase we find a drastic reduction of the spectral
weights of the weakest A_u mode and of the weakest B_u mode with increasing
temperature. Below 20K, the parameters of the A_u phonon modes for E||b show
only subtle changes, which demonstrate a finite but weak coupling between
lattice dynamics and magnetism in MnWO4. A quantitative comparison of our
infrared data with the quasi-static dielectric constant epsilon_b indicates
that the spectral weight of the electromagnon is tiny for E||b, in particular
much smaller than the weak changes of the spectral weight of the phonons.

$F_\infty : (\Sigma, h)\to \mathbb C^2$. When the area bound is less than
$16\pi$, the limit $F_\infty$ is an embedded torus. When the genus of $\Sigma$
is one, we can drop the assumption on convergence $h_n\to h$. When the genus of
$\Sigma$ is zero, we show that there is no branched immersion of $\Sigma$ as a
Lagrangian shrinker, generalizing the rigidity result of Smoczyk in dimension
two by allowing branch points.

about 2,300 microwave, millimeter-wave, sub-millimeter and THz lines and about

images with similar content, but possibly different 3D scenes. One of the
challenges in designing such a system is the local scale differences of objects
appearing in the two images. Previous methods often considered only small
subsets of image pixels; matching only pixels for which stable scales may be
reliably estimated. More recently, others have considered dense
correspondences, but with substantial costs associated with generating, storing
and matching scale invariant descriptors. Our work here is motivated by the
observation that pixels in the image have contexts -- the pixels around them --
which may be exploited in order to estimate local scales reliably and
repeatably. Specifically, we make the following contributions. (i) We show that
scales estimated in sparse interest points may be propagated to neighboring
pixels where this information cannot be reliably determined. Doing so allows
scale invariant descriptors to be extracted anywhere in the image, not just in
detected interest points. (ii) We present three different means for propagating
this information: using only the scales at detected interest points, using the
underlying image information to guide the propagation of this information
across each image, separately, and using both images simultaneously. Finally,
(iii), we provide extensive results, both qualitative and quantitative,
demonstrating that accurate dense correspondences can be obtained even between
very different images, with little computational costs beyond those required by
existing methods.

Superconductivity can be generated in the presence of a random distribution of
NUCs. The NUCs play dual roles as both pair creator and pair breaker, and the
competition of the two effects results in non-monotonic dependence of the mean
field superconducting transition temperature on the density of NUCs. Global
phase coherence is established through coupling the locally superconducting
puddles via Josephson coupling. Rare fluctuations play important roles, and a
globally superconducting phase can only be achieved at large enough
concentration of NUCs. The p-wave component of the superconducting order
parameter gives rise to frustration among the superconducting grains, which is
captured by a Potts-XY type model. New phases with chiral order, glass order,

grains.

consist in classify the pixels into two or more groups depending on their
intensity levels and a threshold value. The quality of the segmentation depends
on the method applied to select the threshold. The use of the classical
implementations for multilevel thresholding is computationally expensive since
they exhaustively search the best values to optimize the objective function.
Under such conditions, the use of optimization evolutionary approaches has been
extended. The Electromagnetism Like algorithm (EMO) is an evolutionary method
which mimics the attraction repulsion mechanism among charges to evolve the
members of a population. Different to other algorithms, EMO exhibits
interesting search capabilities whereas maintains a low computational overhead.
In this paper, a multilevel thresholding (MT) algorithm based on the EMO is
introduced. The approach combines the good search capabilities of EMO algorithm
with objective functions proposed by the popular MT methods of Otsu and Kapur.
The algorithm takes random samples from a feasible search space inside the
image histogram. Such samples build each particle in the EMO context whereas
its quality is evaluated considering the objective that is function employed by
the Otsu or Kapur method. Guided by these objective values the set of candidate
solutions are evolved through the EMO operators until an optimal solution is
found. The approach generates a multilevel segmentation algorithm which can
effectively identify the threshold values of a digital image in a reduced
number of iterations. Experimental results show performance evidence of the
implementation of EMO for digital image segmentation.

SpeX at 0.8-2.4$\mu$m to investigate the spatial distribution of the stellar

NGC3310 and NGC7714. We use the STARLIGHT code updated with the synthetic
simple stellar populations models computed by Maraston (2005, M05). Our main
results are that the NIR light in the nuclear surroundings of the galaxies is
dominated by young/intermediate age SPs ($t \leq 2\times10^9$yr), summing from
$\sim$40\% up to 100\% of the light contribution. In the nuclear aperture of
two sources (NGC1614 and NGC3310) we detected a predominant old SP component
($t > 2\times10^9$yr), while for NGC34 and NGC7714 the younger component
prevails. Furthermore, we found evidence of a circumnuclear star formation
ring-like structure and a secondary nucleus in NGC1614, in agreement with
previous studies. We also suggest that the merger/interaction experienced by
three of the galaxies studied, NGC1614, NGC3310 and NGC7714 can explain the
lower metallicity values derived for the young SP component of these sources.
In this scenario the fresh unprocessed metal poorer gas from the
destroyed/interacting companion galaxy is driven to the centre of the galaxies
and mixed with the central region gas, before star formation takes place. In
order to deepen our analysis, we performed the same procedure of SP synthesis
using Maraston (2011, M11) EPS models. Our results show that the newer and
higher resolution M11 models tend to enhance the old/intermediate age SP
contribution over the younger ages.

stochastic codes. Contrary to deterministic codes, stochastic codes can give
different results when they are called several times with the same input. In
this paper, two approaches are proposed to build a metamodel of the probability
density function of a stochastic code output. The first one is based on kernel
regression and the second one consists in decomposing the output density on a
basis of well-chosen probability density functions, with a metamodel linking
the coefficients and the input parameters. For the second approach, two types
of decomposition are proposed, but no metamodel has been designed for the
coefficients yet. This is a topic of future research. These methods are applied
to two analytical models and three industrial cases.

features. Recently, even the possibility of having nulls in the power spectrum
(at certain scales) has been considered. The existence of these nulls has been
shown in linear perturbation theory. What shall be the effect of higher order
corrections on such nulls? Inspired by this question, we attempt to calculate
quantum radiative corrections to the Fourier transform of the two-point
function in a toy field theory and address the issue of how these corrections
to the power spectrum behave in models in which the tree-level power spectrum
has a sharp dip (but not a null). In particular, we consider the possibility of
the relative enhancement of radiative corrections in a model in which the
tree-level spectrum goes through a dip in power at a certain scale. The mode
functions of the field (whose power spectrum is to be evaluated) are chosen
such that they undergo the kind of dynamics that leads to a sharp dip in the
tree level power spectrum. Next we consider the situation in which this field
has quartic self interactions and find one loop correction in a suitably chosen
renormalization scheme. We thus attempt to answer the following key question in
the context of this toy model (which is as important in the realistic case): in
the chosen renormalization scheme, can quantum radiative corrections get
enhanced relative to tree-level power spectrum at scales at which sharp dips
appear in the tree-level spectrum?

satisfiability of the conjunction of any two Boolean formulas from a set called
a full representation of Boolean functions of $n$ variables - a set containing
a Boolean formula to represent each Boolean function of $n$ variables. The
contradiction proof first assumes that there exists a Post machine (Post's
Formulation 1) that correctly decides the satisfiability of the conjunction of
any two Boolean formulas from such a set by following an execution path that
includes fewer than $2^n$ conditional branches. By using multiple runs of this
Post machine, with one run for each Boolean function of $n$ variables, the
proof derives a contradiction by showing that this Post machine is unable to
correctly decide the satisfiability of the conjunction of at least one pair of
Boolean formulas from a full representation of $n$-variable Boolean functions
if the machine executes fewer than $2^n$ conditional branches. This lower bound
of $2^n$ conditional branches holds for any full representation of Boolean
functions of $n$ variables, even if a full representation consists solely of
minimized Boolean formulas derived by a Boolean minimization method. We discuss
why the lower bound fails to hold for satisfiability of certain restricted
formulas, such as 2CNF satisfiability, XOR-SAT, and HORN-SAT. We also relate
the lower bound to 3CNF satisfiability. The lower bound does not depend on
sequentiality of access to the boxes in the symbol space and will hold even if

Furthermore, we elucidate why there is such a close relationship between the

reproduce an IGM equation of state with $T_0 \approx 10^4 K$ and $\gamma

al. (2009), the mean flux is 10-15 per cent below observed values at z=2, and a
factor of 2 too small at z = 4. We show the effects of the common practice of
rescaling optical depths to the observed mean flux and how it affects
convergence rates. We also investigate the common practice of `splicing'
results from a number of different simulations to estimate the 1D flux power

We use hydrodynamic cosmological simulations of the Local Group to study the
discriminating factors for galaxy formation in the early Universe and connect
them to the present-day properties of galaxies and halos. A combination of
selection effects related to reionization, and the subsequent evolution of
halos in different environments, introduces strong biases between the
population of halos that host dwarf galaxies, and the total halo population.
Halos that host galaxies formed earlier and are more concentrated. In addition,
halos more affected by tidal stripping are more likely to host a galaxy for a
given mass or maximum circular velocity, vmax, today. Consequently, satellite
halos are populated more frequently than field halos, and satellite halos of
10^8 - 10^9 solar masses or vmax of 12 - 20 km/s, similar to the Local Group
dwarf spheroidals, have experienced a greater than average reduction in both
mass and vmax after infall. They are on closer, more radial orbits with higher
infall velocities and earlier infall times. Together, these effects make dwarf
galaxies highly biased tracers of the underlying dark matter distribution.

cloud MS30.7-81.4-118 (MS30.7), a constituent of the Magellanic Stream. In
order to investigate the origin of this enhancement, we have analyzed two
overlapping XMM-Newton observations of this cloud. We find that the X-ray
enhancement is $\sim$6' or $\sim$100 pc across, and is concentrated to the
north and west of the densest part of the cloud. We modeled the X-ray
enhancement with a variety of spectral models. A single-temperature equilibrium
plasma model yields a temperature of $(3.69^{+0.47}_{-0.44}) \times 10^6$ K and
a 0.4-2.0 keV luminosity of $7.9 \times 10^{33}$ erg s$^{-1}$. However, this
model underpredicts the on-enhancement emission around 1 keV, which may
indicate the additional presence of hotter plasma ($T \gtrsim 10^7$ K), or that
recombination emission is important. We examined several different physical
models for the origin of the X-ray enhancement. We find that turbulent mixing
of cold cloud material with hot ambient material, compression or shock heating
of a hot ambient medium, and charge exchange reactions between cloud atoms and
ions in a hot ambient medium all lead to emission that is too faint. In
addition, shock heating in a cool or warm medium leads to emission that is too
soft (for reasonable cloud speeds). We find that magnetic reconnection could
plausibly power the observed X-ray emission, but resistive
magnetohydrodynamical simulations are needed to test this hypothesis. If
magnetic reconnection is responsible for the X-ray enhancement, the observed
spectral properties could potentially constrain the magnetic field in the
vicinity of the Magellanic Stream.

large-scale radio jets, as a rotationally-symmetric helical modulation, which
provides a useful way to search for other tight pairs without needing extremely
high resolution observations. As we found this tight pair after searching only
six galaxies, we conclude that tight pairs are more common than hitherto
believed, which is an important observational constraint for low-frequency

  cluster galaxies","extended final version is published as arXiv:1601.03744",,,,"astro-ph.HE astro-ph.GA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  (Abridged) We propose a new method to estimate the Bondi (hot gas) accretion
rates, \dot M_B, onto the supermassive black holes (SMBHs) at the centres of
elliptical galaxies. It can be applied even if the Bondi radius is not
well-resolved in X-ray observations. This method is based on two simple
assumptions: (1) hot gas outside the Bondi radius is in nearly a hydrostatic
equilibrium, and (2) the gas temperature near the galaxy centre is close to the
virial temperature. We apply this method to 28 bright elliptical galaxies in
nearby galaxy clusters (27 of them are the brightest cluster galaxies; BCGs).
We find a correlation between the Bondi accretion rates and the power of jets
associated with the SMBHs over four orders of magnitude in \dot M_B. For most
galaxies, the accretion rates are large enough to account for the jet powers.
Our results indicate that the feedback from the active galactic nuclei (AGN)
correlates with the properties of the hot gas surrounding the SMBHs. We also
find that more massive SMBHs in BCGs tend to have larger specific growth rates.
This may explain the hyper masses (~ 10^10 M_sun) of some of the SMBHs.
Comparison between the accretion rates and the X-ray luminosities of the AGN
suggests that the AGN in the BCGs are extremely radiatively inefficient
compared with X-ray binaries in the Milky Way, even when their Eddington
accretion ratio, \dot M_B/\dot M_Edd, exceeds 0.01. Lastly, we find a tight
correlation between the Bondi accretion rates and the X-ray luminosities of
cool cores. Their relation is linear and the power generated by the Bondi
accretion is large enough to compensate the radiative cooling of the cool
cores. Although the `classical' Bondi accretion model is a greatly
oversimplified one, the correlations we find here demonstrate that the
accretion onto the SMBHs reflects broadly the properties of the Bondi
accretion.

overdensities on both sides of the Galactic disk, extending between b = -25 and
b = +35 degrees and covering over 130 degrees in Galactic longitude. The
structure exhibits a complex morphology with both stream-like features and a
sharp edge to the structure in both the north and the south. We compare this
map to mock observations of two published simulations aimed at explaining such
structures in the outer stellar disk, one postulating an origin as a tidal
stream and the other demonstrating a scenario where the disk is strongly
distorted by the accretion of a satellite. These morphological comparisons of
simulations can link formation scenarios to observed structures, such as
demonstrating that the distorted-disk model can produce thin density features
resembling tidal streams. Although neither model produces perfect agreement
with the observations--the tidal stream predicts material at larger distances
which is not detected while in the distorted disk model the midplane is warped
to an excessive degree--future tuning of the models to accommodate these latest
data may yield better agreement.

apply the results of our simplified model to the $Z_3$ NMSSM for
Singlino/Higgsino(S/H) or Bino/Higgsino(B/H) DM. In the case of S/H DM, we find
that the DM must be be very close to a pseudoscalar resonance to be viable, and
large $\tan\beta$ and positive values of $\mu$ are preferred for evading direct
detection constraints while simultaneously obtaining the observed Higgs mass.
In the case of B/H DM, by contrast, the situation is much less tuned:
annihilation generally occurs off-resonance, and for large $\tan\beta$ direct
detection constraints are easily satisfied by choosing $\mu$ sufficiently large
and negative. The B/H model generally has a light, largely MSSM-like
pseudoscalar with no accompanying charged Higgs, which could be searched for at
the LHC.

probe of the ionization state of the intergalactic medium (IGM). Here we
present the most complete study to date of the IGM Lya opacity, and its
application to the redshift evolution of the 'Lya fraction', i.e. the fraction
of color-selected galaxies with a detectable Lya emission line. We use a tiered
approach, which combines large-scale semi-numeric simulations of reionization
with moderate-scale hydrodynamic simulations of the ionized IGM. This allows us
to simultaneously account for evolution in both: (i) the opacity from an
incomplete (patchy) reionization, parameterized by the filling factor of
ionized regions, Q_HII; and (ii) the opacity from self-shielded systems in the
ionized IGM, parameterized by the average photo-ionization rate inside HII
regions, \Gamma. In contrast to recent empirical models, attenuation from
patchy reionization has a unimodal distribution along different sightlines,
while attenuation from self-shielded systems is more bimodal. We quantify the
average IGM transmission in our (Q_HII, \Gamma) parameter space, which can
easily be used to interpret new data sets. Using current observations, we
predict that the Lya fraction cannot drop by more than a factor of ~2 with IGM
attenuation alone, even for HII filling factors as low as Q_HII>0.1. Larger
changes in the Lya fraction could result from a co-evolution with galaxy
properties. Marginalizing over \Gamma, we find that current observations
constrain Q_HII < 0.6 at z=7 [68% confidence level (C.L.)]. However, all of our
parameter space is consistent with observations at 95% C.L., highlighting the
need for larger observational samples at z >= 6.

The analysis shows that the readout contribution can be reduced to that of the

actual search over database. We introduce a quantum model of an unordered phone
book (quantum database) with programmable queries to search in the phone book
either for a number, or for a name. In the second part we investigate how
successful the algorithm can be if the number of elements of the database is
not known precisely. This question reduces to analysis of the
distinguishability of states occurring during Grover's algorithm. We found that
using unambiguous discrimination scheme even a seemingly good guess, that is
close to the optimal one can result in a rather small success rate.

the susceptibility is finite inside the subcritical phase. We prove that the
cluster size distribution decays exponentially in the subcritical phase, and
sub-exponentially in the supercritical phases. For a model of lattice animals

criterion. We show that the steady-state separation mode, where the separation
front speed is independent of the wave amplitude, exists only in a bounded
speed-dependent range of the wave amplitude. As the latter exceeds the critical
value the steady-state mode is replaced by a more complicated regime with
porous-like local separations emerging at a distance ahead of the main

group speed is greater than the phase speed. The analytical solution allows us

periodic process. As the incident wave amplitude grows the period decreases,
while the separation front speed averaged over the period increases to the

symmetry (1D) and axial symmetry (2D) with different progenitor models by
Woosley & Heger (2007) from 12 $M_{\odot}$ to 100 $M_{\odot}$, we find that all
1D runs fail to produce an explosion and several 2D runs succeed. The
difference in the shock evolutions for different progenitors can be interpreted
by the difference in their mass accretion histories, which are in turn
determined by the density structures of progenitors. The mass accretion history
has two phases in the majority of the models: the earlier phase in which the
mass accretion rate is high and rapidly decreasing and the later phase with a
low and almost constant accretion rate. They are separated by the so-called
turning point, the origin of which is a change of the accreting layer. We argue
that shock revival will most likely occur around the turning point and hence
that its location in the $\dot M$-$L_\nu$ plane will be a good measure for the
possibility of shock revival: if the turning point lies above the critical
curve and the system stays there for a long time, shock revival will obtain. In
addition, we develop a phenomenological model to approximately evaluate the
trajectories in the $\dot M$-$L_\nu$ plane, which, after calibrating free
parameters by a small number of 1D simulations, reproduces the location of the
turning point reasonably well by using the initial density structure of
progenitor alone. We suggest the application of the phenomenological model to a
large collection of progenitors in order to infer without simulations which
ones are more likely to explode.

traditionally been driven by the goal of achieving sensible model selection and
parameter estimation. The formalization of properties that characterize good
performance has led to the development and popularization of thick tailed
mixtures of g priors such as the Zellner--Siow and hyper-g priors. The
properties of a particular prior are typically illuminated under limits on the
likelihood or the prior. In this paper we introduce a new, conditional
information asymptotic that is motivated by the common data analysis setting
where at least one regression coefficient is much larger than others. We
analyze existing mixtures of g priors under this limit and reveal two new
behaviors, Essentially Least Squares (ELS) estimation and the Conditional
Lindley's Paradox (CLP), and argue that these behaviors are, in general,
undesirable. As the driver behind both of these behaviors is the use of a
single, latent scale parameter that is common to all coefficients, we propose a
block hyper-g prior, defined by first partitioning the covariates into groups
and then placing independent hyper-g priors on the corresponding blocks of
coefficients. We provide conditions under which ELS and the CLP are avoided by
the new class of priors, and provide consistency results under traditional
sample size asymptotics.

undergo deflections, which uniquely characterize the surface geometry of the
object. Associated with each point on the surface is a deflection map (or
spectrum) which describes the pattern of deflections in various directions.
This article presents a novel method to efficiently acquire and reconstruct
sparse deflection spectra induced by smooth object surfaces. To this end, we
leverage the framework of Compressed Sensing (CS) in a particular
implementation of a schlieren deflectometer, i.e., an optical system providing
linear measurements of deflection spectra with programmable spatial light
modulation patterns. We design those modulation patterns on the principle of
spread spectrum CS for reducing the number of observations. The ability of our
device to simultaneously observe the deflection spectra on a dense
discretization of the object surface is related to a Multiple Measurement
Vector (MMV) model. This scheme allows us to estimate both the noise power and
the instrumental point spread function.
  We formulate the spectrum reconstruction task as the solving of a linear
inverse problem regularized by an analysis sparsity prior using a translation
invariant wavelet frame. Our results demonstrate the capability and advantages
of using a CS based approach for deflectometric imaging both on simulated data
and experimental deflectometric data.
  Finally, the paper presents an extension of our method showing how we can
extract the main deflection direction in each point of the object surface from
a few compressive measurements, without needing any costly reconstruction
procedures. This compressive characterization is then confirmed with
experimental results on simple plano-convex and multifocal intra-ocular lenses
studying the evolution of the main deflection as a function of the object point
location.

eclipsing WZ Sge-type dwarf nova MASTER OT J005740.99+443101.5 and found
evidence of a sharp eclipse during the phase of early superhumps. The profile
can be reproduced by a combination of the eclipse of the axisymmetric disk and
the uneclipsed light source of early superhumps. This finding confirms the lack
of evince of a greatly enhanced hot spot during the early stage of WZ Sge-type
outburst. We detected growing (stage A) superhumps in MN Dra and give a
suggestion that some of SU UMa-type dwarf novae situated near the critical

large negative period derivatives reported in such systems can be understood a
result of the combination of stage A and B superhumps. The WZ Sge-type dwarf

independent of overtone number (or BAW resonance frequency) overcoming the
constraint and allowing better observation of quantum effects in a mechanical
system. The piezoelectric electro-mechanical coupling approach is qualitatively
compared to the parametric optomechanical technique for the curved BAW
cavities. In both cases the detectible quantity grows proportional to the
square root of the overtone number, and thus the resonance frequency. Also, the
phonon trapping improves with higher overtone numbers, which allows the
electrode size to be reduced such that in the optimal case the parasitic
capacitive impedance becomes independent of the overtone number, allowing
effective coupling to very high frequency overtones.

superconductivity as found in the heavy-fermions, high-transition-temperature

superconductivity emerges in the vicinity of long-range antiferromagnetically
ordered state.[1] In addition to doping charge carriers, the application of
external physical pressure has been taken as an effective and clean approach to
induce the unconventional superconductivity near a magnetic quantum critical
point (QCP).[2,3] Superconductivity has been observed in a majority of 3d
transition-metal compounds,[4-9] except for the Cr- and Mn-based compounds in
the sense that the low-lying states near Fermi level are dominated by their 3d
electrons. Herein, we report on the discovery of superconductivity on the verge
of antiferromagnetic order in CrAs via the application of external high
pressure. Bulk superconductivity with Tc ~ 2 K emerges at the critical pressure
Pc ~ 8 kbar, where the first-order antiferromagnetic transition at TN = 265 K
under ambient pressure is completely suppressed. Abnormal normal-state
properties associated with a magnetic QCP have been observed nearby Pc. The
close proximity of superconductivity to an antiferromagnetic order suggests an
unconventional pairing mechanism for the superconducting state of CrAs. The
present finding opens a new avenue for searching novel superconductors in the
Cr and other transitional-metal based systems.

the contributions to atmospheric loss from both giant impacts and planetesimal
accretion. Giant impacts cause global motion of the ground. Using analytic
self-similar solutions and full numerical integrations we find (for isothermal
atmospheres with adiabatic index ($\gamma=5/3$) that the local atmospheric mass
loss fraction for ground velocities $v_g < 0.25 v_{esc}$ is given by
$\chi_{loss}=(1.71 v_g/v_{esc})^{4.9}$, where $v_{esc}$ is the escape velocity
from the target. Yet, the global atmospheric mass loss is a weaker function of
the impactor velocity $v_{Imp}$ and mass $m_{Imp}$ and given by $X_{loss} ~
0.4x+1.4x^2-0.8x^3$ (isothermal atmosphere) and $X_{loss} ~ 0.4x+1.8x^2-1.2x^3$
(adiabatic atmosphere), where $x=(v_{Imp}m/v_{esc}M)$. Atmospheric mass loss
due to planetesimal impacts proceeds in two different regimes: 1) Large enough
impactors $m > \sqrt{2} \rho_0 (\pi h R)^{3/2}$ (25~km for the current Earth),
are able to eject all the atmosphere above the tangent plane of the impact
site, which is $h/2R$ of the whole atmosphere, where $h$, $R$ and $\rho_0$ are
the atmospheric scale height, radius of the target, and its atmospheric density
at the ground. 2) Smaller impactors, but above $m>4 \pi \rho_0 h^3$ (1~km for
the current Earth) are only able to eject a fraction of the atmospheric mass
above the tangent plane. We find that the most efficient impactors (per unit
impactor mass) for atmospheric loss are planetesimals just above that lower
limit and that the current atmosphere of the Earth could have resulted from an
equilibrium between atmospheric erosion and volatile delivery to the atmosphere
from planetesimals. We conclude that planetesimal impacts are likely to have
played a major role in atmospheric mass loss over the formation history of the
terrestrial planets. (Abridged)

positionally consistent with the Cygnus Cocoon discovered by $Fermi$-LAT at GeV
energies in the Cygnus superbubble. Reanalyzing the ARGO-YBJ data collected
from November 2007 to January 2013, the angular extension and energy spectrum
of ARGO J2031+4157 are evaluated. After subtracting the contribution of the
overlapping TeV sources, the ARGO-YBJ excess map is fitted with a
two-dimensional Gaussian function in a square region of $10^{\circ}\times
10^{\circ}$, finding a source extension $\sigma_{ext}$=
1$^{\circ}$.8$\pm$0$^{\circ}$.5. The observed differential energy spectrum is
$dN/dE =(2.5\pm0.4) \times 10^{-11}(E/1 TeV)^{-2.6\pm0.3}$ photons cm$^{-2}$
s$^{-1}$ TeV$^{-1}$, in the energy range 0.2-10 TeV. The angular extension is
consistent with that of the Cygnus Cocoon as measured by $Fermi$-LAT, and the
spectrum also shows a good connection with the one measured in the 1-100 GeV
energy range. These features suggest to identify ARGO J2031+4157 as the
counterpart of the Cygnus Cocoon at TeV energies. The Cygnus Cocoon, located in
the star-forming region of Cygnus X, is interpreted as a cocoon of freshly
accelerated cosmic rays related to the Cygnus superbubble. The spectral
similarity with Supernova Remnants indicates that the particle acceleration
inside a superbubble is similar to that in a SNR. The spectral measurements
from 1 GeV to 10 TeV allows for the first time to determine the possible
spectrum slope of the underlying particle distribution. A hadronic model is
adopted to explain the spectral energy distribution.

shows a positive spectral index-flux correlation for each object (Sobolewska &
Papadakis 2009). An inner advection dominated accretion flow (ADAF) may connect
to a thin disc/corona at a certain transition radius, which are responsible for
hard X-ray emission in AGN. The ADAF is hot and its X-ray spectrum is hard,
while the corona above the disc is relatively cold and its X-ray spectrum is
therefore soft. The radiation efficiency of the ADAF is usually much lower than
that of the thin disc. The increase of the transition radius may lead to
decreases of the spectral index (i.e., a hard spectrum) and the X-ray
luminosity even if the accretion rate is fixed, and vice versa. We propose that
such X-ray variability is caused by the change of the transition radius. Our

transition radius fluctuates around an equilibrium position, and the radiation

Ia supernovae Union 2.1 sample and 116 long gamma-ray bursts. The luminosity
distance is expanded with model-independent cosmographic parameters as a
function of $z/(1+z)$ directly. Thus the results are independent of cosmology
model. We find a dipolar anisotropy in the direction ($l=309.2^\circ \pm
15.8^\circ$, $b=-8.6^\circ \pm 10.5^\circ$) in galactic coordinates with a
significant evidence $97.29\%$ (more than $2~\sigma$). The magnitude is
$(1.37\pm 0.57) \times 10^{-3}$ for the dipole, and $(2.6\pm 2.1)\times
10^{-4}$ for the monopole, respectively. This dipolar anisotropy is more
significant at low redshift from the redshift tomography analysis. We also test
whether this preferred direction is caused by bulk flow motion or dark energy
dipolar scalar perturbation. We find that the direction and the amplitude of
the bulk flow in our results are approximately consistent with the bulk flow
surveys. Therefore, bulk flow motion may be the main reason for the anisotropic
expansion at low redshift, but the effect of dipolar distribution dark energy
can not be excluded, especially at high redshift.

F814W filters, approximately every two weeks for two years, with the principal
aim of detecting a hidden population of isolated black holes and neutron stars
through astrometric microlensing. Proper motions were measured with an accuracy
of ~0.1 mas/yr (~4 km/s) at F606W~25.5 mag, and better than ~0.5 mas/yr (20
km/s) at F606W~28 mag, in both axes. Proper-motion measurements allowed us to
separate disk and bulge stars and obtain a clean bulge color-magnitude diagram.
We then identified for the first time a white dwarf (WD) cooling sequence in
the Galactic bulge, together with a dozen candidate extreme horizontal branch
stars. The comparison between theory and observations shows that a substantial
fraction of the WDs (30%) are systematically redder than the cooling tracks for
CO-core H-rich and He-rich envelope WDs. This evidence would suggest the
presence of a significant number of low-mass WDs and WD - main sequence
binaries in the bulge. This hypothesis is further supported by the finding of
two dwarf novae in outburst, two short-period (P < 1 d) ellipsoidal variables,
and a few candidate cataclysmic variables in the same field.

simulation predicts the occurrence of a floating incommensurate (IC)
Kosterlitz-Thouless (KT) type phase, which never emerges in non-equilibrium
relaxation (NER) simulations. In this paper, we first examine previously
published results of both methods, and then investigate a higher transition
temperature, $T_{c1}$, between the IC and paramagnetic phases. In the usual
equilibrium simulation, we calculate the layer magnetization on larger lattices
(up to $512 \times 512$ sites) and estimate $T_{c1} \approx 1.16J$ with
frustration ratio $\kappa (\equiv -J_2/J_1) = 0.6$. We examine the nature of
the phase transition in terms of the Binder ratio $g_L$ of spin overlap
functions and the correlation-length ratio $\xi/L$. In the NER simulation, we
observe the spin dynamics in equilibrium states by means of an autocorrelation
function, and also observe the layer magnetization relaxations from the ground
and disordered states. These quantities exhibit an algebraic decay at $T

choosing control scheme. One is the coherent feedback, which feeds the output
field of the system, through a fully quantum device, back to manipulate the
system without involving any measurement process. The other one is the
measurement-based feedback, which measures the output field and performs a
real-time manipulation on the system based on the measurement results. Both
schemes have advantages/disadvantages, depending on the system and the control
goal, hence their comparison in several situation is important. This paper
considers a general open linear quantum system with the following specific
control goals; back-action evasion (BAE), generation of a quantum
non-demolished (QND) variable, and generation of a decoherence-free subsystem
(DFS), all of which have important roles in quantum information science. Then
some no-go theorems are proven, clarifying that those goals cannot be achieved
by any measurement-based feedback control. On the other hand it is shown that,
for each control goal, there exists a coherent feedback controller
accomplishing the task. The key idea to obtain all the results is system
theoretic characterizations of BAE, QND, and DFS in terms of controllability
and observability properties or transfer functions of linear systems, which are
consistent with their standard definitions.

upon previous studies by incorporating a significant number of additional
spectra and precise determination of frequencies. Four frequencies were
identified for this star: $1.6774 \pm 0.0002$ d$^{-1}$, $1.4174 \pm 0.0002$
d$^{-1}$, $0.0714 \pm 0.0002$ d$^{-1}$, and $1.8228 \pm 0.0002$ d$^{-1}$ which
were identified with the modes ($l$,$m$) = ($1,+1$), ($1,+1$), ($2,-2$), and
($1,+1$) respectively. These findings are in agreement with the most recent
literature. The prevalence of ($l$,$m$) = ($1,+1$) modes in $\gamma$ Doradus
stars is starting to become apparent and we discuss this result.

Once the exact ground state is obtained, its properties can be easily analyzed.

interestingly, saturates in the $U \to \infty$ limit. The unapproximated

configurations in the ground state present ""Zittern"" (trembling)
characteristics which are absent in 2D square Hubbard systems. Consequently,
the manifestation of the local Coulomb repulsion in 2D square and honeycomb

dusty gas clouds irradiated by an active galactic nucleus (AGN) to investigate
the dependence of evolution of clouds on the ionization parameter $\mathcal{U}$
and the Str{\""o}mgren number $\mathcal{N}_{S}$. We find that the evolution can
be classified into two cases depending on $\mathcal{U}$. In low $\mathcal{U}$
cases ($\mathcal{U}\approx 10^{-2}$), the evolution is mainly driven by
photo-evaporation. A approximately spherically-symmetric evaporation flow with
velocity of $100\operatorname{-}150\;\mathrm{km\;s^{-1}}$ is launched from the
irradiated face. The cloud is compressed by a D-type shock with losing its mass
due to photo-evaporation and is finally turned into a dense filament by
$t\lesssim 1.5t_{\mathrm{sc}}$. In high $\mathcal{U}$ cases
($\mathcal{U}\approx 5\times 10^{-2}$), radiation pressure suppresses
photo-evaporation from the central part of the irradiated face, reducing
photo-evaporation rate. A evaporation flow from the outskirts of the irradiated
face is turned into a high velocity ($\lesssim 500\;\mathrm{km\;s^{-1}}$) gas
wind because of radiation pressure on dust. The cloud is swept by a radiation
pressure-driven shock and becomes a dense gas disk by $t\approx
t_{\mathrm{sweep}}$. Star formation is expected in these dense regions for both
cases of $\mathcal{U}$. We discuss the influences of the AGN radiation on the
clumpy torus. A simple estimate suggests that the clumps are destroyed in
timescales shorter than their orbital periods. For the clumpy structure to be
maintained over long period, the incident radiation field needs to be
sufficiently weaken for most of the clumps, or, some mechanism that creates the
clumps continuously is needed.

with thermodynamic perspectives like the Random First-Order Transition theory
(RFOT), the purely dynamic approach of the Dynamical Facilitation (DF) theory
lacks experimental validation. Further, for glass transitions induced by
randomly freezing a subset of particles in the liquid phase, simulations
support the predictions of RFOT, whereas the DF theory remains unexplored.
Here, using video microscopy and holographic optical tweezers, we show that
dynamical facilitation in a colloidal glass-forming liquid unambiguously grows
with density as well as the fraction of pinned particles. In addition, we show
that heterogeneous dynamics in the form of string-like cooperative motion,
which is believed to be consistent with RFOT, emerges naturally within the

fermionic DM components with nearly degenerate masses are stabilized by an
$Z_2$ symmetry and interact with the right-handed muon and tau only via real
Yukawa couplings, together with an additional $Z_2$-odd singly-charged scalar.
In this setup, the decay from the heavy DM to the lighter one via the
transition electric dipole yields the 3.55 keV X-ray signal observed recently.
The Yukawa couplings in the dark sector are assumed to be hierarchical, so that
the observed DM relic abundance can be achieved with the leading s-wave
amplitudes without a fine-tuning. We also consider the constraints from flavor
physics, DM direct detections and collider searches, respectively.

waves on a thin layer of (Ga,Mn)(As,P). The out-of-plane uniaxial magnetic
anisotropy of this dilute magnetic semiconductor is very sensitive to the
strain of the layer, making it an ideal test material for the dynamic control
of magnetization via magneto-striction. The time-domain measurement of the
amplitude and phase of the transmitted SAW during magnetic field sweeps
indicated a clear resonant behavior at a field close to the one calculated to
give a precession frequency equal to the SAW frequency. A resonance was
observed from 5K to 85K, just below the Curie temperature of the layer. A full
analytical treatment of the coupled magnetization/acoustic dynamics showed that
the magneto-strictive coupling modifies the elastic constants of the material
and accordingly the wave-vector solution to the elastic wave equation. The
shape and position of the resonance were well reproduced by the calculations,
in particular the fact that velocity (phase) variations resonated at lower
fields than the acoustic attenuation variations.

tailor physical properties of atomically thin two-dimensional (2D) materials.
In graphene/graphene and graphene/boron-nitride structures it leads to
interesting physical phenomena ranging from new van Hove singularities1-4 and
Fermi velocity renormalization5, 6 to unconventional quantum Hall effects7 and
Hofstadter's butterfly pattern8-12. 2D transition metal dichalcogenides
(TMDCs), another system of predominantly vdW-coupled atomically thin layers13,
14, can also exhibit interesting but different coupling phenomena because TMDCs
can be direct or indirect bandgap semiconductors15, 16. Here, we present the
first study on the evolution of interlayer coupling with twist angles in
as-grown MoS2 bilayers. We find that an indirect bandgap emerges in bilayers
with any stacking configuration, but the bandgap size varies appreciably with
the twist angle: it shows the largest redshift for AA- and AB-stacked bilayers,
and a significantly smaller but constant redshift for all other twist angles.
The vibration frequency of the out-of-plane phonon in MoS2 shows similar twist
angle dependence. Our observations, together with ab initio calculations,
reveal that this evolution of interlayer coupling originates from the repulsive
steric effects, which leads to different interlayer separations between the two
MoS2 layers in different stacking configurations.

it is shown that the distribution of the power density of extragalactic rays
over energy is of the power law, ${\bar q}(E)\propto E^{-2.7}$, with the same
index of $2.7$ that has the distribution of Galactic cosmic rays before so
called 'knee', $E<3\cdot 10^{15}eV$. However, the average power of
extragalactic sources, which is of ${\cal E}\simeq 10^{43}erg \,s^{-1}$, at
least two orders exceeds the power emitted by the Galaxy in cosmic rays,
assuming that the density of galaxies is estimated as $N_g\simeq 1 Mpc^{-3}$.
Considering that such power can be provided by relativistic jets from active
galactic nuclei with the power ${\cal E}\simeq 10^{45} - 10^{46} erg \,
s^{-1}$, we estimate the density of extragalactic sources of cosmic rays as
$N_g\simeq 10^{-2}-10^{-3}\, Mpc^{-3}$. Assuming the same nature of Galactic
and extragalactic rays, we conclude that the Galactic rays were produced by a
relativistic jet emitted from the Galactic center during the period of its
activity in the past. The remnants of a bipolar jet are now observed in the
form of bubbles of relativistic gas above and below the Galactic plane. The
break, observed in the spectrum of Galactic rays ('knee'), is explained by fast
escape of energetic particle, $E>3\cdot 10^{15}eV$, from the Galaxy because of
the dependence of the coefficient of diffusion of cosmic rays on energy,
$D\propto E^{0.7}$. The obtained index of the density distribution of particles
over energy, $N(E)\propto E^{-2.7-0.7/2}=E^{-3.05}$, for $E>3\cdot 10^{15}eV$
agrees well with the observed one, $N(E)\propto E^{-3.1}$. Estimated time of
termination of the jet in the Galaxy is $4.2\cdot 10^{4}$ years ago.

adjusting the detuning of the driving beam we varied the relative contributions

which reads out a spatially multimode state of atomic memory. We measured the
temporal evolution of the readout fields and the spatial intensity correlations
between write-in and readout as a function of detuning with the use of an
intensified camera. The correlation maps enabled us to resolve between the
anti-Stokes and the Stokes scattering and to quantify their contributions. Our
experimental results agree quantitatively with a simple, plane-wave theoretical
model we provide. They allow for a simple interpretation of the coaction of the
anti-Stokes and the Stokes scattering at the readout stage. The Stokes
contribution yields additional, adjustable gain at the readout stage, albeit
with inevitable extra noise. Here we provide a simple and useful framework to
trace it, which is significant to the existing atomic memories setups.
Furthermore, the shown Hamiltonian manipulation offers a broad range of
atom-light interfaces readily applicable in current and future quantum
protocols with atomic ensembles.

and nonnegative. We proposed {\it variance competitiveness} as a quality
measure of estimators: For each data vector, we consider the minimum variance
attainable on it by an unbiased and nonnegative estimator. We then define the
competitiveness of an estimator as the maximum ratio, over data, of the
expectation of the square to the minimum possible. We also presented a general
construction of the L$^*$ estimator, which is defined for any MEP for which a
nonnegative unbiased estimator exists, and is at most 4-competitive.
  Our aim here is to obtain tighter bounds on the {\em universal ratio}, which
we define to be the smallest competitive ratio that can be obtained for any
MEP. We obtain an upper bound of 3.375, improving over the bound of $4$ of the
L$^*$ estimator. We also establish a lower bound of 1.44. The lower bound is
obtained by constructing the {\it optimally competitive} estimator for
particular MEPs. The construction is of independent interest, as it facilitates
estimation with instance-optimal competitiveness.

phase matching and to apply this to the stars HD49933 observed by CoRoT, and
HD177153 (aka Perky), observed by Kepler Methods. We use theoretical analysis,
phase shifts, and model fitting. Results. We define the inner and outer phase
shifts of a frequency set of a model star and show that the outer phase shifts
are (almost) independent of degree $\ell$, and that a function of the inner
phase shifts (the phase function) collapses to an $\ell$ independent function
of frequency in the outer layers. We then show how to use this result in a
model fitting technique to find a best fit model to an observed frequency set
by calculating the inner phase shifts of a model using the observed frequencies
and determining the extent to which the phase function collapses to a single
function of frequency in the outer layers. We give two examples applying this
technique to the frequency sets of HD49933 observed by CoRoT and HD177153 (aka
Perky) observed by Kepler, and compare our results with those of previous
studies and show that they are compatible with those obtained using different
techniques. We show that there can be many different models that fit the data
within the errors and that better precision on the frequencies is needed to
discriminate between the models. We compare this technique to that using the
ratios of small to large separations, showing that in principle it is more
accurate and avoids the problem of correlated errors in separation ratio
fitting.

show that Atlas is currently librating in both the 54:53
co-rotation-eccentricity resonance (CER) and the 54:53 inner Lindblad (ILR)
resonance with Prometheus, making it the latest example of a coupled CER-ILR
system, in common with the Saturnian satellites Anthe, Aegaeon and Methone, and
possibly Neptune's ring arcs. We further demonstrate that Atlas's orbit is
chaotic, with a Lyapunov time of ~10 years, and show that its chaotic behaviour
is a direct consequence of the coupled resonant interaction with Prometheus,
rather than being an indirect effect of the known chaotic interaction between
Prometheus and Pandora. We provide an updated analysis of the second-order
resonant perturbations involving Prometheus, Pandora and Epimetheus based on
the new observations, showing that these resonant arguments are librating only
when Epimetheus is the innermost of the co-orbital pair, Janus and Epimetheus.

state exhibits a remanent M and electric polarization below ~150 K. Upon
sweeping E between +- 2 MV/m, M is quasi-linearly varied between +- 2

non-volatile changes of {\Delta}M = +- 0.15 {\mu}B/f.u., depending on the

non-volatile two-states of M at zero magnetic field are observable up to ~150 K

resonance measurements provide microscopic evidences that the electric field

magnetic domains change accompanied by the domain wall motion. The present
findings point to a new pathway for realizing the large magnetization reversal

on a certain ring of operators that acts on the completion at a point of the
function field of the curve. This approach was generalized to higher
dimensional algebraic varieties by Beilinson in 1980. However Beilinson's paper
had very few details, and his operator-theoretic construction remained cryptic
for many years. Currently there is a renewed interest in the Beilinson-Tate
approach to residues in higher dimensions.
  Our paper presents a variant of Beilinson's operator-theoretic construction.
We consider an n-dimensional topological local field K, and define a ring of
operators E(K) that acts on K, which we call the ring of local Beilinson-Tate
operators. Our definition is of an analytic nature (as opposed to the original
geometric definition of Beilinson). We study various properties of the ring
E(K). In particular we show that E(K) has an n-dimensional cubical
decomposition, and this gives rise to a residue functional in the style of
Beilinson-Tate. Presumably this residue functional coincides with the residue
functional that we had constructed in 1992; but we leave this as a conjecture.

building block in the structural studies. In the case of general linear groups
over a finite field $F_q$, given a sequence of positive integers $n_1, ...,

a quantum algorithm of time polynomial in $\log q$ and $n$ for solving the

random vectors with covariance matrix $\Sigma.$ The problem of estimating
$\Sigma$ when $p$ is much larger than $n$ has received a lot of attention in
recent years. Yet little is known about the information criterion for
covariance matrix estimation. How to properly define such a criterion and what
are the statistical properties? We attempt to answer these questions in the
present paper by focusing on the estimation of bandable covariance matrices
when $p>n$ but $\log(p)=o(n)$. Motivated by the deep connection between Stein's
unbiased risk estimation (SURE) and AIC in regression models, we propose a
family of generalized SURE ($\text{SURE}_c$) indexed by $c$ for covariance
matrix estimation, where $c$ is some constant. When $c$ is 2, $\text{SURE}_2$
provides an unbiased estimator of the Frobenious risk of the covariance matrix
estimator. Furthermore, we show that by minimizing $\text{SURE}_2$ over all
possible banding covariance matrix estimators we attain the minimax optimal
rate of convergence and the resulting estimator behaves like the covariance
matrix estimator obtained by the so-called oracle tuning. On the other hand, we
also show that $\text{SURE}_2$ is selection inconsistent when the true
covariance matrix is exactly banded. To fix the selection inconsistency, we
consider using SURE with $c=\log(n)$ and prove that by minimizing
$\text{SURE}_{\log(n)}$ we select the true bandwith with probability tending to
one. Therefore, our analysis indicates that $\text{SURE}_2$ and
$\text{SURE}_{\log(n)}$ can be regarded as the AIC and BIC for large covariance
matrix estimation, respectively.

susceptibility including vertex corrections respects the Ward identity and
yields a manifestly gauge-invariant response in finite dimensions. For
computing the susceptibility, we use a different expression and establish its
formal equivalence to the standard DMFT formula. It allows for a more stable
analytical continuation. We find a zero-sound mode expected for short-range
forces. The relation between the vertex corrections, gauge invariance, and the
appearance of the collective modes is discussed. Long-range forces are treated
within extended dynamical mean-field theory. In order to obtain a
gauge-invariant response, it is necessary to additionally incorporate some non
local vertex corrections into the polarization. In doing so, we obtain plasmons
in the three-dimensional Hubbard model. The plasma frequency is determined by
the (single-particle) density distribution as a consequence of gauge
invariance. We compare this result with the plasma frequency extracted from the
analytical continuation of the susceptibility. It is in good agreement with the
prediction from the gauge-invariance condition.

for eigenvalues of general second order elliptic operators in any dimension.
Unlike most methods in the literature, the proposed method only needs to solve
one discrete eigenvalue problem but not involves any base or intermediate
eigenvalue problems, and does not need any a priori information concerning
exact eigenvalues either. Moreover, it just assumes basic regularity of exact
eigenfunctions. This method is defined by a novel generalized Crouzeix-Raviart
element which is proved to yield asymptotic lower bounds for eigenvalues of
general second order elliptic operators, and a simple post-processing method.
As a byproduct, a simple and cheap method is also proposed to obtain guaranteed
upper bounds for eigenvalues, which is based on generalized Crouzeix-Raviart
element approximate eigenfunctions, an averaging interpolation from the the
generalized Crouzeix-Raviart element space to the conforming linear element
space, and an usual Rayleigh-Ritz procedure. The ingredients for the analysis
consist of a crucial projection property of the canonical interpolation
operator of the generalized Crouzeix-Raviart element, explicitly computable
constants for two interpolation operators. Numerics are provided to demonstrate
the theoretical results.

interdependency between different image modalities such as intensity and depth.
Fusing corresponding information can be achieved on several levels, and one
promising approach is the integration at a low level. Moreover, sparse signal
models have successfully been used in many vision applications. Within this
area of research, the so called co-sparse analysis model has attracted
considerably less attention than its well-known counterpart, the sparse
synthesis model, although it has been proven to be very useful in various image
processing applications. In this paper, we propose a co-sparse analysis model
that is able to capture the interdependency of two image modalities. It is
based on the assumption that a pair of analysis operators exists, so that the
co-supports of the corresponding bimodal image structures are correlated. We
propose an algorithm that is able to learn such a coupled pair of operators
from registered and noise-free training data. Furthermore, we explain how this
model can be applied to solve linear inverse problems in image processing and
how it can be used for image registration tasks. This paper extends the work of
some of the authors by two major contributions. Firstly, a modification of the
learning process is proposed that a priori guarantees unit norm and zero-mean
of the rows of the operator. This accounts for the intuition that contrast in
image modalities carries the most information. Secondly, the model is used in a
novel bimodal image registration algorithm which estimates the transformation
parameters of unregistered images of different modalities.

secure wireless layered video information to multiple single-antenna secondary

non-convex optimization problem for minimization of the total transmit power at
the secondary transmitter. The proposed framework takes into account a quality
of service (QoS) requirement regarding video communication secrecy in the
secondary system, the imperfection of the channel state information (CSI) of
potential eavesdroppers (primary receivers) at the secondary transmitter, and a
limit for the maximum tolerable received interference power at the primary
receivers. Thereby, the proposed problem formulation exploits the
self-protecting architecture of layered transmission and artificial noise
generation to ensure communication secrecy. Semidefinite programming (SDP)
relaxation is employed to derive a resource allocation algorithm which finds
the global optimal solution to the formulated problem. Simulation results
demonstrate significant transmit power savings and robustness against CSI
imperfection for the proposed resource allocation algorithm for layered
transmission compared to baseline schemes with traditional single-layer
transmission.

so falls into every astrophysical black hole. The blueshift of the infalling
photons, measured by a static observer, is infinite at the event horizon. This
raises a question as to whether a ""firewall"" of high energy density may form
just outside the horizon, or whether the effect can be attributed exclusively
to a singular behavior of the static observer's frame at the horizon. In
principle, the presence of such firewall may alter the motion of the infalling
matter, influence the black hole evolution, or even invalidate the {\it vacuum}
Einstein field equation solution as a realistic approximation for black holes.
In this paper we show by means of analytic calculations that all these effects
indeed exist, but their magnitude is typically negligibly small, even though
the matter stress tensor is divergent in the static frame at $r=2M$. That is
not surprising because of the divergent relation of that frame to a freely
falling frame as $r \rightarrow 2M$; however it represents a kind of classical
analogue for the Black Hole Complementarity principle that has been proposed
for quantum effects near a black hole. What is perhaps more surprising is the
divergence of the radiation stress tensor for massive particles moving on
circular geodesic orbits for values of $r$ approaching $r = 3M$. However such
orbits will not occur for infalling matter in realistic accretion discs.

problem and neutrino mass generation in the minimal inverse seesaw realisation.
The Standard Model is extended by two right-handed neutrinos and three sterile
fermionic states, leading to three light active neutrino mass eigenstates, two
pairs of (heavy) pseudo-Dirac mass eigenstates and one (mostly) sterile state
with mass around the keV, possibly providing a dark matter candidate, and
accounting for the recently observed and still unidentified monochromatic 3.5
keV line in galaxy cluster spectra. The conventional production mechanism
through oscillation from active neutrinos can account only for $\sim 43\%$ of
the observed relic density. This can be slightly increased to $\sim 48\%$ when
including effects of entropy injection from the decay of light (with mass below
20 GeV) pseudo-Dirac neutrinos. The correct relic density can be achieved
through freeze-in from the decay of heavy (above the Higgs mass) pseudo-Dirac
neutrinos. This production is only effective for a limited range of masses,
such that the decay occurs not too far from the electroweak phase transition.
We thus propose a simple extension of the inverse seesaw framework, with an
extra scalar singlet coupling to both the Higgs and the sterile neutrinos,
which allows to achieve the correct dark matter abundance in a broader region
of the parameter space, in particular in the low mass region for the
pseudo-Dirac neutrinos.

the simultaneous removal of all reactions/genes in the set abolishes growth of
an organism. In silico, synthetic lethal sets can be identified by simulating
the effect of removal of gene sets from the reconstructed genome-scale
metabolic network of an organism. Flux balance analysis (FBA), based on linear
programming, has emerged as a powerful tool for the in silico analyses of
metabolic networks. To identify all possible synthetic lethal reactions
combinations, an exhaustive sampling of all possible combinations is
computationally expensive. We surmount the computational complexity of
exhaustive search by iteratively restricting the sample space of reaction
combinations for search, resulting in a substantial reduction in the running
time. We here propose an algorithm, Fast-SL, which provides an efficient way to
analyse metabolic networks for higher order lethal reaction sets. Fast-SL
offers a substantial speed-up through a massive reduction in the search space
for synthetic lethals; in the case of E. coli, Fast-SL reduces the search space
for synthetic lethal triplets by over 4000-fold. Fast-SL also compares
favourably with SL Finder, an algorithm for identifying synthetic lethal sets,
by Suthers et al (2009), which involves the solution of a bi-level Mixed
Integer Linear Programming problem. We have implemented the Fast-SL algorithm
in MATLAB, building upon COBRA toolbox v2.0.

exhibiting robustness, but adversely demanding considerable computational

methods that employ iterative optimization procedures for detecting multiple
circles. Since only one circle can be marked at each optimization cycle,
multiple executions must be enforced in order to achieve multi detection. This
paper presents an algorithm for automatic detection of multiple circular shapes
that considers the overall process as a multi-modal optimization problem. The
approach is based on the artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm, a swarm
optimization algorithm inspired by the intelligent foraging behavior of honey
bees. Unlike the original ABC algorithm, the proposed approach presents the
addition of a memory for discarded solutions. Such memory allows holding
important information regarding other local optima which might have emerged
during the optimization process. The detector uses a combination of three
non-collinear edge points as parameters to determine circle candidates. A
matching function (nectar- amount) determines if such circle candidates
(bee-food-sources) are actually present in the image. Guided by the values of
such matching functions, the set of encoded candidate circles are evolved
through the ABC algorithm so that the best candidate (global optimum) can be
fitted into an actual circle within the edge only image. Then, an analysis of
the incorporated memory is executed in order to identify potential local
optima, i.e., other circles.

  Following our previous work we use hydrostatic and dynamical model
atmospheres to simulate observed high-resolution near-infrared spectra of 12
variable and non-variable red giants in the globular cluster 47 Tuc. The 47 Tuc
red giants are independently well-characterized in important parameters (mass,
metallicity, luminosity). The principal aim was to compare synthetic spectra
based on the dynamical models with observational spectra of 47 Tuc variables.
Assuming that the abundances are unchanged on the upper giant branch in these
low-mass stars, our goal is to estimate the impact of atmospheric dynamics on
the abundance determination.
  We present new measurements of the C/O and 12C/13C ratio for 5 non-variable
red giants in 47Tuc. The equivalent widths measured for our 7 variable stars
strongly differ from the non-variable stars and cannot be reproduced by either
hydrostatic or dynamical model atmospheres. Nevertheless, the dynamical models
fit the observed spectra of long-period variables much better than any
hydrostatic model. For some spectral features, the variations in the line
intensities predicted by dynamical models over a pulsation cycle give similar
values as a sequence of hydrostatic models with varying temperature and
constant surface gravity.

high-Q microwave cavity and the dipole is a Rydberg transition of an atom. For
this specific situation we analyze the limitations on the fidelity due to
parameter fluctuations and identify robust dynamics based on pulses found using
ensemble OCT. Our analysis can be extended to quantum-state preparation of
continuous-variable systems in other platforms, such as trapped ions and

of the polar ice sheets, we design high-order finite element discretizations
and scalable solvers for the solution of nonlinear incompressible Stokes
equations. We focus on power-law, shear thinning rheologies used in modeling
ice dynamics and other geophysical flows. We use nonconforming hexahedral
meshes and the conforming inf-sup stable finite element velocity-pressure
pairings $\mathbb{Q}_k\times \mathbb{Q}^\text{disc}_{k-2}$ or $\mathbb{Q}_k
\times \mathbb{P}^\text{disc}_{k-1}$. To solve the nonlinear equations, we
propose a Newton-Krylov method with a block upper triangular preconditioner for
the linearized Stokes systems. The diagonal blocks of this preconditioner are
sparse approximations of the (1,1)-block and of its Schur complement. The
(1,1)-block is approximated using linear finite elements based on the nodes of
the high-order discretization, and the application of its inverse is
approximated using algebraic multigrid with an incomplete factorization
smoother. This preconditioner is designed to be efficient on anisotropic
meshes, which are necessary to match the high aspect ratio domains typical for
ice sheets. We develop and make available extensions to two libraries---a
hybrid meshing scheme for the p4est parallel AMR library, and a modified
smoothed aggregation scheme for PETSc---to improve their support for solving
PDEs in high aspect ratio domains. In a numerical study, we find that our
solver yields fast convergence that is independent of the element aspect ratio,
the occurrence of nonconforming interfaces, and of mesh refinement, and that
depends only weakly on the polynomial finite element order. We simulate the ice
flow in a realistic description of the Antarctic ice sheet derived from field
data, and study the parallel scalability of our solver for problems with up to
383M unknowns.

dark matter ($\psi$DM) composed of a non-relativistic Bose-Einstein condensate,
so the uncertainty principle counters gravity below a Jeans scale. Here we
achieve the first cosmological simulations of this quantum state at
unprecedentedly high resolution capable of resolving dwarf galaxies, with only
one free parameter, $\bf{m_B}$, the boson mass. We demonstrate the large scale
structure of this $\psi$DM simulation is indistinguishable from CDM, as
desired, but differs radically inside galaxies. Connected filaments and
collapsed haloes form a large interference network, with gravitationally
self-bound solitonic cores inside every galaxy surrounded by extended haloes of
fluctuating density granules. These results allow us to determine
$\bf{m_B=(8.1^{+1.6}_{-1.7})\times 10^{-23}~eV}$ using stellar phase-space
distributions in dwarf spheroidal galaxies. Denser, more massive solitons are
predicted for Milky Way sized galaxies, providing a substantial seed to help
explain early spheroid formation. Suppression of small structures means the

particular, this theory provides statements about uniqueness, existence, and

conditions. In terms of the corresponding polynomial equations, the results
guarantee uniqueness and existence of positive solutions for all positive
parameters.
  We address a recent extension of CRNT, called generalized mass-action
systems, where reaction rates are allowed to be power-laws in the
concentrations. In particular, the (real) kinetic orders can differ from the
(integer) stoichiometric coefficients. As with mass-action kinetics, complex
balancing equilibria are determined by the graph Laplacian of the underlying
network and can be characterized by binomial equations and parametrized by
monomials. In algebraic terms, we focus on a constructive characterization of
positive solutions of polynomial equations with real and symbolic exponents.
  Uniqueness and existence for all rate constants and initial conditions
additionally depend on sign vectors of the stoichiometric and kinetic-order
subspaces. This leads to a generalization of Birch's theorem, which is robust
with respect to certain perturbations in the exponents. In this context, we
discuss the occurrence of multiple complex balancing equilibria. We illustrate
our results by a running example and provide a MAPLE worksheet with

discuss the different contributions of the experimental setup to the phase
difference \Delta\phi(\nu) between transmitter arm and receiver arm. A simple
model based on three contributions yields a quantitative description of the
overall behavior of \Delta\phi(\nu). Firstly, the optical path-length
difference gives rise to a term linear in frequency. Secondly, the
ultra-wideband log-spiral antennae effectively radiate and receive in a
frequency-dependent active region, which in the most simple model is an annular
area with a circumference equal to the wavelength. The corresponding term
changes by roughly 6 pi between 100 GHz and 1 THz. The third contribution stems
from the photomixer impedance. In contrast, the derivative (d\Delta\phi / d\nu)
is dominated by the contribution of periodic modulations of \Delta\phi(\nu)
caused by standing waves, e.g., in the photomixers' Si lenses. Furthermore, we
discuss the Fourier-transformed spectra, which are equivalent to the waveform
in a time-domain experiment. In the time domain, the group delay introduced by
the log-spiral antennae gives rise to strongly chirped signals, in which low
frequencies are delayed. Correcting for the contributions of antennae and
photomixers yields sharp peaks or ""pulses"" and thus facilitates a
time-domain-like analysis of our continuous-wave data.

$N$ disordered chains with inter-chain coupling $t$ is examined. Localization
becomes weaker than for the 1D disordered chain ($t=0$) when $t$ is smaller
than the longitudinal hopping $t'=1$, and localization becomes usually much
stronger when $t\gg t'$. This is not so for all $N$. We find ""immunity"" to
strong localization for open (periodic) lateral boundary conditions when $N$ is
odd (a multiple of four), with localization that is weaker than for $t=0$ and
rather insensitive to $t$ when $t \gg t'$. The peculiar $N$-dependence and a
critical scaling with $N$ is explained by a perturbative treatment in $t'/t$,
and the correspondence to a weakly disordered effective chain is shown. Our
results could be relevant for experimental studies of localization in photonic
waveguide arrays.

gradient projection (SGP) method, proposed by Bonettini et al. in a recent
paper for constrained smooth optimization. The main feature of SGP is the
presence of a variable scaling matrix multiplying the gradient, which may
change at each iteration. In the last few years, an extensive numerical
experimentation showed that SGP equipped with a suitable choice of the scaling
matrix is a very effective tool for solving large scale variational problems
arising in image and signal processing. In spite of the very reliable numerical
results observed, only a weak, though very general, convergence theorem is
provided, establishing that any limit point of the sequence generated by SGP is
stationary. Here, under the only assumption that the objective function is
convex and that a solution exists, we prove that the sequence generated by SGP
converges to a minimum point, if the scaling matrices sequence satisfies a
simple and implementable condition. Moreover, assuming that the gradient of the
objective function is Lipschitz continuous, we are also able to prove the
O(1/k) convergence rate with respect to the objective function values. Finally,
we present the results of a numerical experience on some relevant image
restoration problems, showing that the proposed scaling matrix selection rule
performs well also from the computational point of view.

term of the entropy in the high temperature limit \beta/a<<1 of a massive field
theory in 3-dimensional spherical spaces M_3 with constant curvature 6/a^2. For
masses lower than 2\pi/\beta, this term can be identified with the free energy
of the same theory on M_3 considered as a 3-dimensional Euclidean space-time.
The non-extensive part of this free energy, S_hol, is generated by the holonomy
of the spatial metric connection. We show that for homogeneous spherical spaces
the holonomy entropy S_hol decreases monotonically when the RG scale flows to
the infrared. At the conformal fixed points the values of the holonomy entropy
do coincide with the genuine topological entropies recently introduced. The
monotonic behavior of the RG flow leads to an inequality between the
topological entropies of the conformal field theories connected by such flow,
i.e. S_top^UV > S_top^IR. From a 3-dimensional viewpoint the same term arises
in the 3-dimensional Euclidean effective action and has the same monotonic
behavior under the RG group flow. We conjecture that such monotonic behavior is
generic, which would give rise to a 3-dimensional generalization of the
c-theorem, along the lines of the 2-dimensional c-theorem and the 4-dimensional
a-theorem. The conjecture is related to recent formulations of the F-theorem.
In particular, the holonomy entropy on lens spaces is directly related to the
topological R\'enyi entanglement entropy on disks of 2-dimensional flat spaces.

appropriate model class, and is classically addressed resorting to
cross-validation or using asymptotic arguments. As recently suggested in the
literature, this can be addressed in a Bayesian framework, where model
complexity is regulated by few hyperparameters, which can be estimated via
marginal likelihood maximization. It is thus of primary importance to design
effective optimization methods to solve the corresponding optimization problem.
If the unknown impulse response is modeled as a Gaussian process with a
suitable kernel, the maximization of the marginal likelihood leads to a
challenging nonconvex optimization problem, which requires a stable and
effective solution strategy. In this paper we address this problem by means of
a scaled gradient projection algorithm, in which the scaling matrix and the
steplength parameter play a crucial role to provide a meaning solution in a
computational time comparable with second order methods. In particular, we
propose both a generalization of the split gradient approach to design the
scaling matrix in the presence of box constraints, and an effective
implementation of the gradient and objective function. The extensive numerical
experiments carried out on several test problems show that our method is very
effective in providing in few tenths of a second solutions of the problems with
accuracy comparable with state-of-the-art approaches. Moreover, the flexibility
of the proposed strategy makes it easily adaptable to a wider range of problems

Studying their behavior and understanding their position in Twitter is thus of
important interest. A recent work provided an efficient way to detect social
capitalists using two simple topological measures. Based on this detection
method, we study how social capitalists are distributed over Twitter's
friend-to-follower network. We are especially interested in analyzing how they
are organized, and how their links spread across the network. Answering these
questions allows to know whether the social capitalism methods increase the
actual visibility on the service. To that aim, we study the position of social
capitalists on Twitter w.r.t. the community structure of the network. We base
our work on the concept of community role of a node, which describes its
position in a network depending on its connectivity at the community level. The
topological measures originally defined to characterize these roles consider
only some aspects of community-related connectivity and rely on a set of
empirically fixed thresholds. We first show the limitations of such measures
and then extend and generalize them by considering new aspects of the
community-related connectivity. Moreover, we use an unsupervised approach to
distinguish the roles, in order to provide more flexibility relatively to the

show that they are highly visible on Twitter, due to the specific roles they

idiosyncrasies they might produce dissimilar modular decompositions of a given
network. In this contribution, we aimed to analyze how alternative modular
descriptions could condition the outcome of follow-up network biology analysis.
We considered a human protein interaction network and two paradigmatic cluster
recognition algorithms, namely: the Clauset-Newman-Moore and the infomap
procedures. We analyzed at what extent both methodologies yielded different
results in terms of granularity and biological congruency. In addition, taking
into account Guimera cartographic role characterization of network nodes, we
explored how the adoption of a given clustering methodology impinged on the
ability to highlight relevant network meso-scale connectivity patterns. As a
case study we considered a set of aging related proteins, and showed that only
the high-resolution modular description provided by infomap, could unveil
statistically significant associations between them and inter-intra modular
cartographic features. Besides reporting novel biological insights that could
be gained from the discovered associations, our contribution warns against
possible technical concerns that might affect the tools used to mine for
interaction patterns in network biology studies. In particular our results
suggested that sub-optimal partitions from the strict point of view of their
modularity levels might still be worth being analyzed when meso-scale features
were to be explored in connection with external source of biological knowledge.

simulations for space and astrophysical plasmas is presented. The conventional
hybrid simulation model dealing with kinetic ions and a massless
charge-neutralizing electron fluid is known to be susceptible to numerical
instability due to divergence of the whistler-mode wave dispersion, as well as
division-by-density operation in regions of low density. Consequently, a pure
vacuum region is not allowed to exist in the simulation domain unless some ad
hoc technique is used. To resolve this difficulty, an alternative way to
introduce finite electron inertia effect is proposed. Contrary to the
conventional method, the proposed one introduces a correction to the electric
field rather than the magnetic field. It is shown that the generalized Ohm's
law correctly reduces to Laplace's equation in a vacuum which therefore does
not involve any numerical problems. In addition, a variable ion-to-electron
mass ratio is introduced to reduce the phase velocity of high frequency
whistler waves at low density regions so that the stability condition is always
satisfied. It is demonstrated that the proposed model is able to handle near
vacuum regions generated as a result of nonlinear self-consistent development
of the system, as well as pure vacuum regions set up at the initial condition,
without losing the advantages of the standard hybrid code.

  Schmidt, Jochen Schiller","The Role of the Internet of Things in Network Resilience",,,,,"cs.NI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Disasters lead to devastating structural damage not only to buildings and
transport infrastructure, but also to other critical infrastructure, such as
the power grid and communication backbones. Following such an event, the
availability of minimal communication services is however crucial to allow
efficient and coordinated disaster response, to enable timely public
information, or to provide individuals in need with a default mechanism to post
emergency messages. The Internet of Things consists in the massive deployment
of heterogeneous devices, most of which battery-powered, and interconnected via
wireless network interfaces. Typical IoT communication architectures enables
such IoT devices to not only connect to the communication backbone (i.e. the
Internet) using an infrastructure-based wireless network paradigm, but also to
communicate with one another autonomously, without the help of any
infrastructure, using a spontaneous wireless network paradigm. In this paper,
we argue that the vast deployment of IoT-enabled devices could bring benefits
in terms of data network resilience in face of disaster. Leveraging their
spontaneous wireless networking capabilities, IoT devices could enable minimal
communication services (e.g. emergency micro-message delivery) while the
conventional communication infrastructure is out of service. We identify the
main challenges that must be addressed in order to realize this potential in
practice. These challenges concern various technical aspects, including
physical connectivity requirements, network protocol stack enhancements, data
traffic prioritization schemes, as well as social and political aspects.

the choice of making direct-scoring (cardinal) or comparative (ordinal)
measurements. In this paper we study the relative merits of either choice,
providing empirical and theoretical guidelines for the selection of a
measurement scheme. We provide empirical evidence based on experiments on
Amazon Mechanical Turk that in a variety of tasks, (pairwise-comparative)
ordinal measurements have lower per sample noise and are typically faster to
elicit than cardinal ones. Ordinal measurements however typically provide less
information. We then consider the popular Thurstone and Bradley-Terry-Luce
(BTL) models for ordinal measurements and characterize the minimax error rates
for estimating the unknown quantity. We compare these minimax error rates to
those under cardinal measurement models and quantify for what noise levels
ordinal measurements are better. Finally, we revisit the data collected from
our experiments and show that fitting these models confirms this prediction:
for tasks where the noise in ordinal measurements is sufficiently low, the
ordinal approach results in smaller errors in the estimation.

parametrized LTL (pLTL) formulas. In pLTL, the until-modality is equipped with
a bound that contains variables; e.g., $\Diamond_{\le x}\ \varphi$ asserts that
$\varphi$ holds within $x$ time steps, where $x$ is a variable on natural
numbers. The central problem studied in this paper is to determine the set of
parameter valuations $V_{\prec p} (\varphi)$ for which the probability to
satisfy pLTL-formula $\varphi$ in a Markov chain meets a given threshold $\prec
p$, where $\prec$ is a comparison on reals and $p$ a probability. As for pLTL
determining the emptiness of $V_{> 0}(\varphi)$ is undecidable, we consider
several logic fragments. We consider parametric reachability properties, a
sub-logic of pLTL restricted to next and $\Diamond_{\le x}$, parametric B\""uchi
properties and finally, a maximal subclass of pLTL for which emptiness of $V_{>
0}(\varphi)$ is decidable.

However, existing schemes to observe such behaviour are not scalable over

oscillators, separated in frequency by 80kHz and situated far from each other

have low loss and be extended over long distances. This scheme is reversible
and can be generalised for arbitrary network configurations.
