equipment failures (units and lines) and wind power correlation on generation
expansion decisions. For this purpose, we use a bilevel stochastic optimization
problem, which models the sequential and noncooperative game between the
generating company (GENCO) and the system operator. The upper-level problem
maximizes the GENCO's expected profit, while the lower-level problem simulates
an hourly market-clearing procedure, through which LMPs are determined. The

by a scenario set, and their impact on generation expansion decisions are

posterior inference in the presence of prior-likelihood discordance, a broader
concept than the usual notion of prior-likelihood conflict. We achieve this
dual purpose by extending the classic notion of \textit{prior sample size},
$M$, in three directions: (I) estimating $M$ beyond conjugate families; (II)
formulating $M$ as a relative notion, i.e., as a function of the likelihood
sample size $k, M(k),$ which also leads naturally to a graphical diagnosis; and
(III) permitting negative $M$, as a measure of prior-likelihood conflict, i.e.,
harmful discordance. Our asymptotic regime permits the prior sample size to
grow with the likelihood data size, hence making asymptotic arguments
meaningful for investigating the impact of the prior relative to that of
likelihood. It leads to a simple asymptotic formula for quantifying the impact
of a proper prior that only involves computing a centrality and a spread
measure of the prior and the posterior. We use simulated and real data to
illustrate the potential of the proposed framework, including quantifying how
weak is a ""weakly informative"" prior adopted in a study of lupus nephritis.
Whereas we take a pragmatic perspective in assessing the impact of a prior on a
given inference problem under a specific evaluative metric, we also touch upon
conceptual and theoretical issues such as using improper priors and permitting
priors with asymptotically non-vanishing influence.

appears as a generalization of the Lieb-Liniger quantum mechanics of bosons to

the model is integrable in terms of a coordinate Bethe Ansatz, as discovered by
Brunet. Using the Brunet-Bethe eigenstates we obtain an exact expression for
the integer moments of $\overline{Z^n}$ for polymers of arbitrary lengths and
fixed endpoint positions. Although these moments do not exist for all integer

all existing integer moments, and which takes the form of a Fredholm

transform and we thereby propose a FD ansatz representation for the probability
distribution function (PDF) of $Z$ and its Laplace transform. In the limit of
very long DP, this ansatz yields that the distribution of the free energy

same statistical distribution of the observed rogue events and are explored
during the light dynamics due to soliton collisions, with inelastic mechanisms
enhancing the process. Slightly different initial conditions lead to very

that there exists a Turing machine with $k$ symbols in its tape alphabet that
correctly decides the satisfiability of the conjunction of any two Boolean
formulas from such a set by making fewer than $2^nlog_k2$ moves. By using
multiple runs of this Turing machine, with one run for each Boolean function of

consider the coherent field at parsec scales in a blazar jet as well as the
turbulent field inside a galaxy cluster. For the latter, we explicitly derive
the transversal components of a magnetic field with gaussian turbulence which
are responsible for the photon-ALP mixing. To illustrate the method, we apply
it to a mock IACT array with characteristics similar to the Cherenkov Telescope
Array and investigate the dependence of the sensitivity to detect a
$\gamma$-ray excess on the magnetic-field parameters.

limiting the number of states to two, the use of d-level quantum systems
(qudits) could provide advantages for quantum information processing. Among
other merits, it has recently been shown that multi-level quantum systems can
offer increased stability to external disturbances - a key problem in current
technologies. In this study we demonstrate that topological quantum memories
built from qudits, also known as abelian quantum double models, exhibit a
substantially increased resilience to noise. That is, even when taking into
account the multitude of errors possible for multi-level quantum systems,
topological quantum error correction codes employing qudits can sustain a
larger error rate than their two-level counterparts. In particular, we find
strong numerical evidence that the thresholds of these error-correction codes
are given by the hashing bound. Considering the significantly increased error
thresholds attained, this might well outweigh the added complexity of
engineering and controlling higher dimensional quantum systems.

recently it has been shown that this mechanism overproduces the gamma ray flux
at GeV energy and violates the observational results from Fermi LAT. We have
considered the synchrotron emission from a broken power law spectrum of

flux from knot A. The two scenarios discussed in our work are (i) magnetic
field is high, synchrotron energy loss time of the protons is shorter than
their escape time from the knot region and the age of the jet (ii) their escape
time is shorter than their synchrotron energy loss time and the age of the jet.
These scenarios can explain the observed photon spectrum well for moderate

of CH4 and CD4 molecules is due, mainly, the difference in the frequencies of
local tranlational and libration vibrations of molecules CH4 and CD4. The
contribution of the tunnel rotation of the CH4 and CD4 molecules to the heat
capacities of this gases is dominant below 8 K. The isotopic effect is caused
by the difference between both the conversion rates and the rotational spectra
of the nuclear spin species of CH4 and CD4 molecules. The conversion rate of
CH4 molecules is several times lower than that of CD4 ones. Weak features
observed in the curves of heat capacity of CH4 and CD4 near 6 K and 8 K,

from point-particle perturbations. Extensive tests of a time domain
implementation in the code {\it Teukode} are presented. The code can
efficiently deliver waveforms at future null infinity. As a first application
of the method, we compute the gravitational waveforms from inspiraling and
coalescing black-hole binaries in the large-mass-ratio limit. The smaller mass
black hole is modeled as a point particle whose dynamics is driven by an
effective-one-body-resummed analytical radiation reaction force. We compare the
analytical angular momentum loss to the gravitational wave angular momentum
flux. We find that higher-order post-Newtonian corrections are needed to
improve the consistency for rapidly spinning binaries. Close to merger, the
subdominant multipolar amplitudes (notably the $m=0$ ones) are enhanced for
retrograde orbits with respect to prograde ones. We argue that this effect
mirrors nonnegligible deviations from circularity of the dynamics during the
late-plunge and merger phase. We compute the gravitational wave energy flux
flowing into the black hole during the inspiral using a time-domain formalism
proposed by Poisson. Finally, a self-consistent, iterative method to compute
the gravitational wave fluxes at leading-order in the mass of the particle is
presented. For a specific case study with $\hat{a}$=0.9, a simulation that uses
the consistent flux differs from one that uses the analytical flux by $\sim35$
gravitational wave cycles over a total of about $250$ cycles. In this case the
horizon absorption accounts for about $+5$ gravitational wave cycles.

problem with input data $(X, Y) \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times p} \times

full data $(X,Y)$, sketching algorithms solve the LS problem using only the
sketched data $(SX, SY)$. Prior work has typically adopted an algorithmic
perspective, in that it has made no statistical assumptions on the input $X$
and $Y$, and instead it has been assumed that the data $(X,Y)$ are fixed and
worst-case (WC). Prior results show that, when using sketching matrices such as
random projections and leverage-score sampling algorithms, with $p < r \ll n$,
the WC error is the same as solving the original problem, up to a small
constant. From a statistical perspective, we typically consider the
mean-squared error performance of randomized sketching algorithms, when data
$(X, Y)$ are generated according to a statistical model $Y = X \beta +
\epsilon$, where $\epsilon$ is a noise process. We provide a rigorous
comparison of both perspectives leading to insights on how they differ. To do
this, we first develop a framework for assessing algorithmic and statistical
aspects of randomized sketching methods. We then consider the statistical
prediction efficiency (PE) and the statistical residual efficiency (RE) of the
sketched LS estimator; and we use our framework to provide upper bounds for
several types of random projection and random sampling sketching algorithms.
Among other results, we show that the RE can be upper bounded when $p < r \ll

addressing the major challenges of cosmology, in particular in understanding
the nature of the dark universe. The strength of these surveys comes from their
unprecedented depth and width. Optimal extraction of their three-dimensional
information is of utmost importance to best constrain the properties of the
dark universe. Although there is theoretical motivation and novel tools to
explore these surveys using the 3D spherical Fourier-Bessel (SFB) power
spectrum of galaxy number counts $C_\ell(k,k^\prime)$, most survey
optimisations and forecasts are based on the tomographic spherical harmonics
power spectrum $C^{(ij)}_\ell$. We performed a new investigation of the
information that can be extracted from the tomographic and 3D SFB techniques by
comparing the forecast cosmological parameter constraints obtained from a
Fisher analysis in the context of planned stage IV wide-field galaxy surveys.
The comparison was made possible by careful and coherent treatment of
non-linear scales in the two analyses. Nuisance parameters related to a scale-
and redshift-dependent galaxy bias were also included for the first time in the
computation of both the 3D SFB and tomographic power spectra. Tomographic and
3D SFB methods can recover similar constraints in the absence of systematics.
However, constraints from the 3D SFB analysis are less sensitive to unavoidable
systematics stemming from a redshift- and scale-dependent galaxy bias. Even for
surveys that are optimised with tomography in mind, a 3D SFB analysis is more
powerful. In addition, for survey optimisation, the figure of merit for the 3D
SFB method increases more rapidly with redshift, especially at higher
redshifts, suggesting that the 3D SFB method should be preferred for designing
and analysing future wide-field spectroscopic surveys.

non-supersymmetric and is obtained from a known intersecting non-supersymmetric
D3-brane with chargeless D0-brane solution of type IIB string theory, by
restricting some parameters characterizing the solution and going to a new
coordinate. In the IR the dilaton is non-constant in general and the metric is
three (spatial) dimensional hyperscaling violating Lifshitz with dynamical
critical exponent $z=(3+3\gamma)/(3-\gamma)$ and hyperscaling violation
exponent $\theta = 12/(3-\gamma)$, where $\gamma$ is a real parameter and can
take continuous values from $-1$ to $+1$. At the two extreme values, i.e., for
$\gamma = \pm 1$, the dilaton is constant. The second solution is
supersymmetric and is obtained from the known F-D2 bound state solution of type
IIA string theory by zooming into a particular region of space. In the UV, the
proper description is given in a T-dual frame which is AdS$_5$, whereas in the
IR, it gives a three dimensional hyperscaling violating Lifshitz with $z=3$ and
$\theta=2=d-1$.

involves the change of the flow structure, with more strongly magnetised flows
approaching the slab geometry more closely. We find that the model with thermal
synchrotron radiation being the main source of seed photons agrees with the
spectral index vs Eddington ratio relation observed in black hole transients
below 1 per cent of the Eddington luminosity, LEdd, and models with a weak
direct heating of electrons (small delta) are more consistent with
observations. Models with large delta predict slightly too soft spectra,
furthermore, they strongly overpredict electron temperatures at ~0.01 LEdd. The
low-luminosity spectra, at <0.001 LEdd, deviate from a power-law shape in the
soft X-ray range and we note that the first-scattering bump often resembles a
thermal like component, with the temperature of a few hundred eV, superimposed
on a power-law spectrum. The model with thermal Comptonization of thermal
synchrotron radiation does not agree with well studied AGNs observed below
~0.01 LEdd, for which there is a substantial evidence for the lack of an inner
cold disc. This indicates that the model of hot flows powering AGNs should be
revised, possibly by taking into account an additional (but internal to the
flow) source of seed photons.

emission lines (most notably the Fe line) in the X-ray spectra of AGN indicate
that this material is located far away from the SMBH. Contributions from the
inner accretion disk, affected by relativistic effects, have also been detected
in several cases.
  We studied the average X-ray spectrum of a sample of 263 X-ray unabsorbed AGN
that yield 419023 counts in the 2-12 keV rest-frame band distributed among 388
XMM-Newton spectra. We fitted the average spectrum using a (basically)
unabsorbed power law (primary radiation). From second model that represents the
interaction of the primary radiation with matter located far away from the
SMBH, we found that it was very significantly detected. Finally, we added a
contribution from interaction with neutral material in the accretion disk close
to the central SMBH, which is therefore smeared by relativistic effects, which
improved the fit at 6 sigma. The reflection factors are 0.65 for the accretion
disk and 0.25 for the torus. Replacing the neutral disk-reflection with
low-ionisation disk reflection, also relativistically smeared, fits the data
equally well, suggesting that we do not find evidence for a significant
ionisation of the accretion disk.
  We detect distant neutral reflection in the average spectrum of unabsorbed
AGN with z=0.8. Adding the disk-reflection component associated with a
relativistic Fe line improves the data description at 6 sigma confidence level,
suggesting that both reflection components are present. The disk-reflection
component accounts for about 70 % of the total reflected flux.

magnetic field is a potential source of systematic error for any experiment
where magnetic fields guide charged particles to detectors with finite size.
Assuming uniform probability as a function of the phase along the particle's
helical trajectory, an analytic solution for the radial probability
distribution function follows which applies to experiments in which particles
are generated throughout a volume that spans a sufficient length along the axis
of a homogeneous magnetic field. This approach leads to the same result as a
different derivation given by Dubbers et al. But the constant phase
approximation does not strictly apply to finite source volumes or fixed
positions, which lead to local maxima in the radial distribution of emitted
particles at the plane of the detector. A simple method is given to calculate
such distributions, then the effect is demonstrated with data from a $^{207}$Bi
electron-conversion source in the superconducting solenoid magnet spectrometer
of the Ultracold Neutron facility at the Los Alamos Neutron Science Center.
Potential future applications of this effect are discussed.

drawing up a corpuscular formalism in which solitons are coherent states of
quantum constituents. This naturally leads to a functional integral
representation, in which the classical saddle point is reached as the most
probable distribution of corpuscles in the $\hbar = 0$ limit and where quantum
corpuscular corrections correspond to excursions away from such a distribution
that occur only for finite $\hbar$. Several striking features come up.
Topological charge emerges as a collective flow of quantum numbers carried by
individual corpuscles. Moreover, the corpuscular corrections are not reducible
to any known form of quantum corrections, such as loop expansions in the
coupling constant $\hbar g^2$ or semiclassical $e^{-1/\hbar g^2}$ effects.
Corpuscular corrections are stronger and appear already at order $\sqrt{\hbar
g^2}$. In SUSY theories quantum corpuscular corrections generically break
supersymmetry. We show that a domain wall which perturbatively is a BPS state,
violates all supersymmetries when the corpuscular effects are taken into
account. The extension of the corpuscular structure to $D$-branes can lead to a
built-in supersymmetry breaking mechanism in string theory, insensitive to
technicalities such as moduli stabilization, with the SUSY breaking scale set
by the string coupling times the $D$-brane tension.

of non-central ultra-relativistic heavy ion collisions indicate the presence of
magnetic fields $B\sim \mathcal{O}(0.1-15\,m_\pi^2)$, where $m_\pi$ is the pion
mass. It is then of special interest to study the effects of strong (Abelian)
magnetic fields on the transport coefficients of strongly coupled non-Abelian
plasmas, such as the quark-gluon plasma formed in heavy ion collisions. In this
work we study the anisotropy in the shear viscosity induced by an external
magnetic field in a strongly coupled $\mathcal{N} = 4$ SYM plasma. Due to the
spatial anisotropy created by the magnetic field, the most general viscosity
tensor of a magnetized plasma has 5 shear viscosity coefficients and 2 bulk
viscosities. We use the holographic correspondence to evaluate two of the shear
viscosities, $\eta_{\perp} \equiv \eta_{xyxy}$ (perpendicular to the magnetic
field) and $\eta_{\parallel} \equiv \eta_{xzxz}=\eta_{yzyz}$ (parallel to the
field). When $B\neq 0$ the shear viscosity perpendicular to the field saturates
the viscosity bound $\eta_{\perp}/s = 1/(4\pi)$ while in the direction parallel
to the field the bound is violated since $\eta_{\parallel}/s < 1/(4\pi)$.
However, the violation of the bound in the case of strongly coupled SYM is
minimal even for the largest value of $B$ that can be reached in heavy ion
collisions.

understood. Here, we present the first detailed charge storage mechanism of

{\beta}-MnO2 using a combined theoretical electrochemical and band structure
analysis. We identify the importance of the band gap, work function, the point
of zero charge, and the tunnel sizes of the electrode material, as well as the
pH and stability window of the electrolyte in determining the viability of a
given electrode material. The high capacity of {\alpha}-MnO2 results from
cation induced charge-switching states in the band gap that overlap with the
scanned potential allowed by the electrolyte. The charge-switching states
originate from interstitial and substitutional cations (H+, Li+, Na+, and K+)
incorporated into the material. Interstitial cations are found to induce
charge-switching states by stabilizing Mn-O antibonding orbitals from the
conduction band. Substitutional cations interact with O[2p] dangling bonds that
are destabilized from the valence band by Mn vacancies to induce
charge-switching states. We calculate the equilibrium electrochemical
potentials at which these states are reduced and predict the effect of the
electrochemical operating conditions on their contribution to charge storage.
The mechanism and theoretical approach we report is general and can be used to
computationally screen new materials for improved charge storage via ion
incorporation.

not substantially different from those generated by the Clinac 21EX, so we have
modified the internal schematics of the Clinac 21EX to simulate TrueBeam
electrons. BEAMnrc/DOSXYZnrc were used to simulate 5x5 and 20x20 cm$^2$
electron fields with MLC-shaped apertures. Secondary collimating jaws were set
0.5 cm beyond the MLC periphery and to 40x40 cm$^2$. Complete accelerator
models agreed with diode measurement within 2%/2 mm at 12 and 20 MeV, and
within 3%/3 mm at 6 MeV. Comparisons of measured depth and profile data showed
dose-dependencies on jaw position; simulated energy fluences scored just above
the phantom showed that, for small apertures, dose dependencies on jaw position
are dominated by changes in the in-field energy fluence (not scattered by jaws
or MLC) at 6 MeV, while at 20 MeV dose dependencies are dominated by the
scattered component. Our models reproduce these jaw position dependencies,
which is an asset as there is no consensus on the optimal position for jaws in

radio observations independently put very severe constraints on a DM

chance, resulting in significant loss of performance and fairness. To improve
performance and fairness, we propose use of the preemptive Shortest Remaining
Time First (SRTF) policy instead. Although SRTF requires an estimate of runtime
of GPU kernels, we show that such an estimate of the runtime can be easily
obtained using online profiling and exploiting a simple observation on GPU
kernels' grid structure. Specifically, we propose a novel Structural Runtime
Predictor. Using a simple Staircase model of GPU kernel execution, we show that
the runtime of a kernel can be predicted by profiling only the first few thread
blocks. We evaluate an online predictor based on this model on benchmarks from
ERCBench, and find that it can estimate the actual runtime reasonably well
after the execution of only a single thread block. Next, we design a thread
block scheduler that is both concurrent kernel-aware and uses this predictor.
We implement the SRTF policy and evaluate it on two-program workloads from
ERCBench. SRTF improves STP by 1.18x and ANTT by 2.25x over FIFO. When compared
to MPMax, a state-of-the-art resource allocation policy for concurrent kernels,
SRTF improves STP by 1.16x and ANTT by 1.3x. To improve fairness, we also
propose SRTF/Adaptive which controls resource usage of concurrently executing
kernels to maximize fairness. SRTF/Adaptive improves STP by 1.12x, ANTT by
2.23x and Fairness by 2.95x compared to FIFO. Overall, our implementation of
SRTF achieves system throughput to within 12.64% of Shortest Job First (SJF, an

approach to this problem consists of fitting a mixture of the conditional score
distributions observed last year to the current score distribution. This is a
special (simple) case of a finite mixture model where the mixture components
are fixed and only the weights of the components are estimated. The optimum
weights provide a forecast of next year's portfolio-wide default rate. We point
out that the maximum-likelihood (ML) approach to fitting the mixture
distribution not only gives an optimum but even an exact fit if we allow the
mixture components to vary but keep their density ratio fix. From this
observation we can conclude that the standard default rate forecast based on
last year's conditional default rates will always be located between last
year's portfolio-wide default rate and the ML forecast for next year. As an
application example, then cost quantification is discussed. We also discuss how
the mixture model based estimation methods can be used to forecast total loss.

statistical difficulties can be overcome by improved data gathering and use of
known techniques that decrease bias. One peculiarity of the SS epidemic is that
the prediction can sometimes be made long before the actual pandemic onset,

modeling is useful to overcome a false sense of security arising from the long

political/psychological factors, as well as improve the public health response.

driven by circularly polarized magnons. Magnons pass through a stationary
domain wall without reflection and thus exert no force on it. However, they
reverse their spin upon transmission, thereby transferring two quanta of
angular momentum to the domain wall and causing it to precess. A precessing
domain wall partially reflects magnons back to the source. The reflection of
spin waves creates a previously identified reactive force. We point out a
second mechanism of propulsion, which we term redshift: magnons passing through
a precessing domain wall lower their frequency by twice the angular velocity of
the domain wall; the concomitant reduction of magnons' linear momentum
indicates momentum transfer to the domain wall. We solve the equations of
motion for spin waves in the background of a uniformly precessing domain wall
with the aid of supersymmetric quantum mechanics and compute the net force and
torque applied by magnons to the domain wall. Redshift is the dominant
mechanism of propulsion at low spin-wave intensities; reflection dominates at
higher intensities. We derive a set of coupled algebraic equations to determine
the linear velocity and angular frequency of the domain wall in a steady state.
The theory agrees well with numerical micromagnetic simulations.

the inelastic backscattering rate, due to the long dwelling time of an electron

the R parameter, i.e. the number ratio of stars in horizontal over red giant
branch of old stellar clusters, would be reduced by the axion production from
photon conversions occurring in stellar cores. In this regard we have compared
the measured R with state-of-the-art stellar models obtained under different
assumptions for $g_{a\gamma}$. We show that the estimated value of
$g_{a\gamma}$ substantially depends on the adopted He mass fraction Y, an
effect often neglected in previous investigations. Taking as benchmark for our
study the most recent determinations of the He abundance in H II regions with
O/H in the same range of the Galactic Globular Clusters, we obtain an upper
bound $g_{a\gamma}<0.66\times 10^{-10}$ GeV$^{-1}$ at 95$\%$ confidence level.
This result significantly improves the constraints from previous analyses and
is currently the strongest limit on the axion-photon coupling in a wide mass
range.

inverted hierarchy is studied, through introduction of a simplified model of
broken flavor symmetry. A new scalar (a flavon) and a new neutral top-philic
massive gauge boson emerge with mass in the TeV range along with a new heavy
fermion associated with the standard model top quark. After checking
constraints from electroweak precision observables, we investigate the
influence of the model on Higgs boson physics, notably on its production cross
section and decay branching fractions. Limits on the flavon $\varphi$ from
heavy Higgs boson searches at the LHC at 7 and 8 TeV are presented. The
branching fractions of the flavon are computed as a function of the flavon mass
and the Higgs-flavon mixing angle. We also explore possible discovery of the
flavon at 14 TeV, particularly via the $\varphi \rightarrow Z^0Z^0$ decay
channel in the $2\ell2\ell'$ final state, and through standard model Higgs
boson pair production $\varphi \rightarrow hh$ in the $b\bar{b}\gamma\gamma$
final state. We conclude that the flavon mass range up to $500$ GeV could
probed down to quite small values of the Higgs-flavon mixing angle with 100

We determine
the formation efficiencies of globular clusters across cosmic time by modeling
the formation and dynamical evolution of the globular cluster population of a
Milky Way type galaxy in hierarchical cosmology, using the merger tree from the
Via Lactea II simulation. All of the models are constrained to reproduce the
observed specific frequency and initial mass function of globular clusters in
isolated dwarfs. Globular cluster orbits are then computed in a time varying
gravitational potential after they are either accreted from a satellite halo or
formed in situ, within the Milky Way halo. We find that the Galactocentric
distances and metallicity distribution of globular clusters are very sensitive
to the formation efficiencies of globular clusters as a function of redshift
and halo mass. Our most accurate models reveal two distinct peaks in the
globular cluster formation efficiency at z~2 and z~7-12 and prefer a formation
efficiency that is mildly increasing with decreasing halo mass, the opposite of
what expected for feedback-regulated star formation. This model accurately
reproduces the positions, velocities, mass function, metallicity distribution,
and age distribution of globular clusters in the Milky Way and predicts that ~
40% formed in situ, within the Milky Way halo, while the other ~ 60% were
accreted from about 20 satellite dwarf galaxies with Vc > 30 km/s, and about
29% or all globular clusters formed at redshifts z > 7. These results further
strengthen the notion that globular cluster formation was an important mode of
star formation in high-redshift galaxies and likely played a significant role
in the reionization of the intergalactic medium

no statistical difference in the satellite distributions of intermediate-mass
quiescent and star-forming centrals, $10.48<\log(M/M_\odot)<10.78$. Comparing
to the Guo2011 semi-analytic model, the excess number of satellites indicates
that quiescent centrals have halo masses 0.3 dex larger than star-forming
centrals, even when the stellar-mass distributions are fixed. We use a simple
toy model that relates halo mass and quenching, which roughly reproduces the
observed quenched fractions and the differences in halo mass between
star-forming and quenched galaxies only if galaxies have a quenching
probability that increases with halo mass from $\sim$0 for
$\log(M_h/M_\odot)\sim$11 to $\sim$1 for $\log(M_h/M_\odot)\sim$13.5. A single

important mechanism, it is unlikely to be the only factor driving quenching. It
remains unclear why a high fraction of centrals remain star-forming even in

interferometers such as Advanced LIGO and Virgo. They are also one of the main
short gamma-ray burst (SGRB) progenitor candidates. If the BH tidally disrupts
its companion, an SGRB may be ignited when a sufficiently massive accretion
disk forms around the remnant BH. Detecting an NS-BH coalescence both in the GW

nature of the source. How much can actually be inferred from a joint detection
is unclear, however, as a mass/spin degeneracy may reduce the GW measurement
accuracy. To shed light on this problem and on the potential of joint EM+GW
observations, we here combine recent semi-analytical predictions for the
remnant disk mass with estimates of the parameter-space portion that is
selected by a GW detection. We identify cases in which an SGRB ignition is
supported, others in which it can be excluded, and finally others in which the
outcome depends on the chosen model for the currently unknown NS equation of
state. We pinpoint a range of systems that would allow us to place lower bounds
on the equation of state stiffness if both the GW emission and its EM
counterpart are observed. The methods we develop can broaden the scope of
existing GW detection and parameter-estimation algorithms and could allow us to
disregard about half of the templates in an NS-BH search following an SGRB

satellite galaxies with stellar masses, ${\rm log} ({\rm M}_*/{\rm

function mass, ${\rm M} \sim {\rm M}^{\ast}$. We fit the radial profiles of
satellite number densities with simple power laws, finding slopes in the range
-1.1 to -1.4 for mass-selected satellites, and -1.3 to -1.6 for passive
satellites. We confirm the tendency for passive satellites to be preferentially
located around passive central galaxies at $3\sigma$ significance and show that
it exists to at least $z\sim2$. Meanwhile, the quenched fraction of satellites
around star-forming galaxies is consistent with field galaxies of equal stellar
masses. We find no convincing evidence for a redshift-dependent evolution of
these trends. One simple interpretation of these results is that only passive
central galaxies occupy an environment that is capable of independently
shutting off star-formation in satellite galaxies. By examining the satellites
of higher stellar mass star-forming galaxies (${\rm log} ({\rm M}_*/{\rm
M}_{\odot}) > 11$), we conclude that the origin of galactic conformity is
unlikely to be exclusively due to the host dark-matter halo mass. A
halo-mass-independent correlation could be established by either formation bias
or a more physical connection between central and satellite star-formation
histories. For the latter, we argue that a star-formation (or AGN) related
outburst event from the central galaxy could establish a hot halo environment
which is then capable of quenching both central and satellite galaxies.

pairs through electromagnetic cascades in pulsar magnetospheres. This process
results in a high multiplicity of electron/positron pairs within the
wind-termination shock of pulsar wind nebula (PWN). A consequence of this
scenario is that no circular polarization should be observed within PWN, since
the contributions from electrons and positrons exactly cancel. Here we note
that current radio instruments are capable of setting meaningful limits on the
circular polarization of synchrotron radiation in PWNs, which observationally
test the model for pulsar production of the local positron excess. The
observation of a PWN with detectable circular polarization would cast strong
doubt on pulsar interpretations of the positron excess, while observations
setting strong limits on the circular polarization of PWN would lend credence
to these models. Finally, we indicate which pulsar wind nebulae are likely to
provide the best targets for observational tests of the AMS-02 excess.

distributed approximately isotropically around their host. The existence of
highly flattened, co-orbiting planes of satellite galaxies has therefore been
identified as a possible problem for these cosmological models, but so far
studies have not considered the hosts' environments. That satellite planes are
now known around both major galaxies in the Local Group raises the question
whether they are more likely around paired hosts. In a first attempt to
investigate this possibility we focus on the flattening and orbital coherence
of the 11 brightest satellite galaxies of the vast polar structure (VPOS)
around the Milky Way (MW). We search for VPOS analogs in the ELVIS suite of
cosmological simulations, which consist of 24 paired and 24 isolated host
halos. We do not find significant differences between the properties of
sub-halo distributions around paired and isolated hosts. The observed
flattening and the observed orbital alignment are each reproduced by only 0.2
to 2 per cent of paired and isolated systems incorporating the obscuration of
satellites by randomly oriented galactic discs. Only one of all 4800 analyzed
realizations (0.02 per cent) reproduces both parameters simultaneously, but the
average orbital pole of this sub-halo system does not align as well with the
normal to the plane fit as observed. That the MW is part of a galaxy pair thus
does not help in explaining the existence of the VPOS if the satellite galaxies

fit to the global, present-day VL2 potential. However, merely assuming an
analytic potential limits the dark matter halo mass measurement to an accuracy
of 5 to 20%, depending on the choice of analytic parametrization. Collectively,
mass estimates using streams from our sample reach this fundamental limit, but
individually they can be highly biased. Individual streams can both under- and
overestimate the mass, and the bias is progressively worse for those with
smaller perigalacticons, motivating the search for tidal streams at
galactocentric distances larger than 70 kpc. We estimate that the assumption of

both modified by the same power-law emissivity (TTMBB). Using these models we
investigate the origin of the submm excess; defined as the submillimeter

pixel-averaged 500 micron submm excesses of 27% and 43% for the LMC and SMC,

calculated from our the fitting results shows that the TTMBB fits require
significantly more dust than are available even if all the metals present in
the interstellar medium (ISM) were condensed into dust. This indicates that the
submm excess is more likely to be due to emissivity variations than a second
population of colder dust. We derive integrated dust masses of (7.3 +/- 1.7) x

Swift/XRT of three relatively unexplored Supergiant Fast X-ray Transients
(SFXTs), IGR J08408-4503, IGR J16328-4726, and IGR J16465-4507, whose hard
X-ray duty cycles are the lowest measured among the SFXT sample, and compare
their properties with those of the prototypical SFXTs. The behaviour of J08408
and J16328 resembles that of other SFXTs, and it is characterized by a
relatively high inactivity duty cycle (IDC) and pronounced dynamic range (DR)
in the X-ray luminosity. Like the SFXT prototypes, J08408 shows two distinct
populations of flares, the first one associated with the brightest outbursts
($L_{\rm X}\gtrsim 10^{35-36}$ erg s$^{-1}$), the second one comprising less
bright events with $L_{\rm X}\lesssim$10$^{35}$ erg s$^{-1}$. This
double-peaked distribution seems to be a ubiquitous feature of the extreme
SFXTs. The lower DR of J16328 suggests it is an intermediate SFXT. We find
J16465 is characterized by IDC$\sim$5% and DR$\sim$40, reminiscent of classical
supergiant HMXBs. The duty cycles measured with XRT are found to be comparable
with those reported previously by BAT and INTEGRAL, when the higher limiting
sensitivities of these instruments are taken into account and sufficiently long
observational campaigns are available. We prove that no clear correlation
exists between the duty cycles of the SFXTs and their orbital periods, which
makes it difficult to interpret the SFXT peculiar variability by only using
arguments related to the properties of supergiant star winds. Our findings
favour the idea that a correct interpretation of the SFXT phenomenology
requires a mechanism to strongly reduce the mass accretion rate onto the
compact object during most of its orbit around the companion, as proposed in a
number of theoretical works. [Abridged]

M, the gas-phase metallicity Z is anti-correlated with the star formation rate
(SFR) of the galaxies. It has also been claimed that the resulting Z(M,SFR)
relation is invariant with redshift - the so-called Fundamental Metallicity
Relation (FMR). Given a number of difficulties in determining metallicities,
especially at higher redshifts, the form of the Z(M,SFR) relation and whether
it is really independent of redshift is still very controversial. To explore
this issue at z>2, we used VLT-SINFONI and Subaru-MOIRCS near-infrared
spectroscopy of 20 zCOSMOS-deep galaxies at 2.1<z<2.5 to measure the strengths
of up to five emission lines: [OII], Hbeta, [OIII], Halpha, and [NII]. This
near-infrared spectroscopy enables us to derive O/H metallicities, and also
SFRs from extinction corrected Halpha measurements. We find that the
mass-metallicity relation (MZR) of these star-forming galaxies at z~2.3 is
lower than the local SDSS MZR by a factor of three to five, a larger change
than found by Erb et al. (2006) using [NII]/Halpha-based metallicities from
stacked spectra. We discuss how the different selections of the samples and
metallicity calibrations used may be responsible for this discrepancy. The
galaxies show direct evidence that the SFR is still a second parameter in the
mass-metallicity relation at these redshifts. However, determining whether the
Z(M,SFR) relation is invariant with epoch depends on the choice of
extrapolation used from local samples, because z>2 galaxies of a given mass
have much higher SFRs than the local SDSS galaxies. We find that the zCOSMOS
galaxies are consistent with a non-evolving FMR if we use the
physically-motivated formulation of the Z(M,SFR) relation from Lilly et al.
(2003), but not if we use the empirical formulation of Mannucci et al. (2010).

we investigate the morphological and kinematical evolution of the stellar
component of disks when galaxies undergo fly-by interactions with adjacent dark
matter halos. We find that the so-called `S'-shaped warps can be excited by
fly-bys and sustained for even up to a few billion years, and that this
scenario provides a cohesive explanation for several key observations. We show
that disk warp properties are governed primarily by the following three
parameters; (1) the impact parameter, i.e., the minimum distance between two
halos, (2) the mass ratio between two halos, and (3) the incident angle of the
fly-by perturber. The warp angle is tied up with all three parameters, yet the
warp lifetime is particularly sensitive to the incident angle of the perturber.
Interestingly, the modeled S-shaped warps are often non-symmetric depending on
the incident angle. We speculate that the puzzling U- and L-shaped warps are
geometrically superimposed S-types produced by successive fly-bys with
different incident angles, including multiple interactions with a satellite on
a highly elongated orbit.

been invoked, assuming a very low intergalactic magnetic field (IGMF). Here we
study the synchrotron emission of UHECR secondaries produced in blazars located
in magnetised environments, and show that it can provide an alternative
explanation to these challenged channels, for sources embedded in structured
regions with magnetic field strengths of the order of $10^{-7}$ G. To
demonstrate this, we focus on three extreme blazars: 1ES 0229+200, RGB
J0710+591, and 1ES 1218+304. We model the expected gamma-ray signal from these
sources through a combination of numerical Monte Carlo simulations and solving
the kinetic equations of the particles in our simulations, and explore the
UHECR source and intergalactic medium parameter space to test the robustness of
the emission. We show that the generated synchrotron pair halo/echo flux at the
peak energy is not sensitive to variations in the overall IGMF strength. This
signal is unavoidable in contrast to the inverse Compton pair halo/echo
intensity, which is appealing in view of the large uncertainties on the IGMF in
voids of large scale structure. It is also shown that the variability of blazar
gamma-ray emission can be accommodated by the synchrotron emission of secondary
products of UHE neutral beams if these are emitted by UHECR accelerators inside
magnetised regions.

we use radical simplifications expressed as neglect of the gravitational
interaction between neighbors and approximation of the incompressible mass
flow. In this frame we show that if the galaxy disc is fuelled constantly by
collisional mass carriers, then the amplification of the gravitomagnetic field
can be large enough to create the rotational velocity pattern and spiral arms.
In this framework the collisional part of the mass gas in the galaxy disc
plane, i.e. molecules and atoms, is responsible for the creation of the
gravitomagnetic field. According to the model the spiral pattern of arms is
static and determined by a direction of the mass flow. The model reproduces
qualitatively the observed spiral arms and reproduces well the shape of the
rotational velocity pattern. As an example of the usability of the proposed
mechanism, we reproduce qualitatively the above features for the IC 342 and NGC
4321 galaxies.

degree to which a variety is not smooth that point. We conjecture a closed

These ideas were obtained through extensive calculations in Sage. Thus, we
include a Sage script which was used in these calculations. It computes the
affine arc spaces $\nabla_{\mathfrak{n}}X$ provided that $X$ is affine,
$\mathfrak{n}$ is a fat point, and the ground field is of characteristic zero.
Finally, we show that the auto Poincar\'e series will often be rational as well

masses through the virial formula and derived Eddington ratios. Moreover, from
optical/IR multi-component SED fitting we have derived the stellar mass of
their host galaxies and their SFRs. We find that most of the sources in our

these sources on the M_BH-M_star plane compared to a sample of optically blue

that increases with redshift which is consistent with or slightly lower than
what has been found for blue QSOs. These sources may represent the blow-out

such large tails. It has also been suggested that fields with large tails are
not necessarily well described by the hierarchy of $N$-point functions. In this
thesis, we are able to make this last statement precise and with the help of
the lognormal model to quantify precisely its implications for inference on
cosmological parameters : we find as our main result that only a tiny fraction
of the total Fisher information of the field is still contained in the
hierarchy of $N$-point moments in the nonlinear regime, rendering parameter
inference from such moments very inefficient. We show that the hierarchy fails
to capture the information that is contained in the underdense regions, which
at the same time are found to be the most rich in information. We find further
our results to be very consistent with numerical analysis using $N$-body
simulations. We also discuss these issues with the help of explicit families of
fields with the same hierarchy of $N$-point moments defined in this work. A
similar analysis is then applied to the convergence field, the weighted
projection of the matter density fluctuation field along the line of sight,

Maxwellian gauge fields without sources. These were reinterpreted in Kholodenko

by the method of Abelian reduction of the non-Abelian Yang-Mills functional.
The developed method uses instanton-type calculations normally employed for the
non-Abelian gauge fields. By invoking the electric-magnetic duality it then
becomes possible to replace all known charges/masses by the particle -like
solutions of the source-free Abelian gauge fields. To employ these results in
high energy physics, it is essential to to extend Ranada's results by carefully
analysing and classifying all dynamically generated knoted/linked structures in
gauge fields, including those discovered by Ranada. This task is completed in
this work. The study is facilitated by the recent progress made in solving the
Moffatt conjecture. Its essence is stated as follows: in steady incompressible
Euler-type fluids the streamlines could have knots/links of all types. By
employing the correspondence between the ideal hydrodynamics and
electrodynamics discussed in part I and by superimposing it with the already
mentioned method of Abelian reduction, it is demonstrated that in the absence
of boundaries only the iterated torus knots and links could be dynamically
generated. Obtained results allow to develop further particle-knot/link
correspondence studied in Kholodenko (2015b)

configuration of interest can be triggered by decrease of strength of the

inside the flux rope due to the adjustment for the internal equilibrium of the
flux rope remains small and does not last very long when the initial state of
the flux rope commences from the stable branch of the theoretical equilibrium
curve. This work also confirms the influence of the initial radius of flux rope

photon in fixed target electroproduction, is preparing for installation at the
Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility (JLab) in the Fall of 2014. As
the first stage of this project, the HPS Test Run apparatus was constructed and
operated in 2012 to demonstrate the experiment's technical feasibility and to
confirm that the trigger rates and occupancies are as expected. This paper
describes the HPS Test Run apparatus and readout electronics and its
performance. In this setting, a heavy photon can be identified as a narrow peak
in the e$^+$e$^-$ invariant mass spectrum, above the trident background or as a
narrow invariant mass peak with a decay vertex displaced from the production
target, so charged particle tracking and vertexing are needed for its
detection. In the HPS Test Run, charged particles are measured with a compact
forward silicon microstrip tracker inside a dipole magnet. Electromagnetic
showers are detected in a PbW0$_{4}$ crystal calorimeter situated behind the
magnet, and are used to trigger the experiment and identify electrons and
positrons. Both detectors are placed close to the beam line and split
top-bottom. This arrangement provides sensitivity to low-mass heavy photons,
allows clear passage of the unscattered beam, and avoids the spray of degraded
electrons coming from the target. The discrimination between prompt and
displaced e$^+$e$^-$ pairs requires the first layer of silicon sensors be
placed only 10~cm downstream of the target. The expected signal is small, and
the trident background huge, so the experiment requires very large statistics.
Accordingly, the HPS Test Run utilizes high-rate readout and data acquisition
electronics and a fast trigger to exploit the essentially 100% duty cycle of
the CEBAF accelerator at JLab.

galaxies have strong optical emission lines, with a clumpy or knot-like

three-dimensional (3D) current sheet about a magnetic null point is described
in detail. We focus on the evolution of the magnetic null points and flux ropes
that are formed during the tearing process. Generally, we find that both
magnetic structures are created prolifically within the layer and are
non-trivially related. We examine how nulls are created and annihilated during
bifurcation processes, and describe how they evolve within the current layer.
The type of null bifurcation first observed is associated with the formation of
pairs of flux ropes within the current layer. We also find that new nulls form
within these flux ropes, both following internal reconnection and as adjacent
flux ropes interact. The flux ropes exhibit a complex evolution, driven by a
combination of ideal kinking and their interaction with the outflow jets from
the main layer. The finite size of the unstable layer also allows us to
consider the wider effects of flux rope generation. We find that the unstable
current layer acts as a source of torsional MHD waves and dynamic braiding of
magnetic fields. The implications of these results to several areas of
heliophysics are discussed.

  In 1979, Lusztig proposed a cohomological construction of supercuspidal

smooth one-dimensional representations of $L^\times$ and representations of

pseudo equivalent widths and their correlation with established scales of
[Fe/H] and $T_{eff}$.
  Results. Our technique achieves a $rms$ of 0.08$\pm$0.01 for [Fe/H],
91$\pm$13 K for $T_{eff}$, and is valid in the (-0.85, 0.26 dex), (2800, 4100

respectively. We also calculated the RMSE$_{V}$ which estimates uncertainties
of the order of 0.12 dex for the metallicity and of 293 K for the effective
temperature. The technique has an activity limit and should only be used for
stars with $\log{L_{H_{\alpha}}/L_{bol}} < -4.0$. Our method is available

pseudobulges have a different zero point and much larger scatter. Motivated by
these developments, we reevaluate the $f$ factor for RM AGNs with available
$\sigma_*$ measurements, updated H$\beta$ RM lags, and new bulge
classifications based on detailed decomposition of high-resolution ground-based

first storing magnetic energy accumulated over time and then releasing it
suddenly. We focus here on this release. A key concept in analysing
reconnection is that of the separatrix, a surface (line in 2D) that separates
the fresh unperturbed plasma embedded in magnetic field lines not yet
reconnected with the hotter exhaust embedded in reconnected field lines. In

theory but not every method that uses projections really belongs to the class
of projection methods as we mean it here. Here projection methods are iterative
algorithms that use projections onto sets while relying on the general
principle that when a family of (usually closed and convex) sets is present
then projections (or approximate projections) onto the given individual sets
are easier to perform than projections onto other sets (intersections, image
sets under some transformation, etc.) that are derived from the given family of
individual sets. Projection methods employ projections (or approximate
projections) onto convex sets in various ways. They may use different kinds of
projections and, sometimes, even use different projections within the same
algorithm. They serve to solve a variety of problems which are either of the
feasibility or the optimization types. They have different algorithmic
structures, of which some are particularly suitable for parallel computing, and
they demonstrate nice convergence properties and/or good initial behavior
patterns. This class of algorithms has witnessed great progress in recent years
and its member algorithms have been applied with success to many scientific,
technological, and mathematical problems. This annotated bibliography includes

cardiac motion? The best known approach is to take a mathematical model of the
fibered structure, insert it into a more-or-less complex model of cardiac
architecture, and then study the resulting fibers of activation that propagate
through the myocardium. In our paper, we have attempted to create a novel
software capable of demonstrate left ventricular (LV) model in normal hearts.
  Method: Echocardiography was performed on 70 healthy volunteers. Data
evaluated included: velocity (radial, longitudinal, rotational and vector
point), displacement (longitudinal and rotational), strain rate (longitudinal
and circumferential) and strain (radial, longitudinal and circumferential) of
all 16 LV myocardial segments. Using these data, force vectors of myocardial
samples were estimated by MATLAB software, interfaced in the echocardiograph
system. Dynamic orientation contraction (through the cardiac cycle) of every
individual myocardial fiber could be created by adding together the sequential
steps of the multiple fragmented sectors of that fiber. This way we attempted
to mechanically illustrate the global LV model.
  Result: Our study shows that in normal cases myocardial fibers initiate from
the posterior basal region of the heart, continues through the LV free wall,
reaches the septum, loops around the apex, ascends, and ends at the
superior-anterior edge of LV.
  Conclusion: We were able to define the whole LV myocardial model
mathematically, by MATLAB software in normal subjects. This will enable
physicians to diagnose and follow up many cardiac diseases when this software
is interfaced within echocardiographic machines.

contact mechanics theory. It casts the evolution of the pressure distribution
${\rm Pr}(p)$ with increasing resolution of surface roughness as a diffusive
process, in which resolution plays the role of time. The tested key assumptions
of the theory are: (a) the diffusion coefficient is independent of pressure
$p$, (b) the diffusion process is drift-free at any value of $p$, (c) the point
$p=0$ acts as an absorbing barrier, i.e., once a point falls out of contact, it
never reenters again, (d) the Fourier component of the elastic energy is only
populated if the appropriate wave vector is resolved, and (e) it no longer
changes when even smaller wavelengths are resolved. Using high-resolution
numerical simulations, we quantify deviations from these approximations and
find quite significant discrepancies in some cases. For example, the drift
becomes substantial for small values of $p$, which typically represent points
in real space close to a contact line. On the other hand, there is a
significant flux of points reentering contact. These and other identified
deviations cancel each other to a large degree, resulting in an overall
excellent description for contact area, contact geometry, and gap distribution
functions. Similar fortuitous error cancellations cannot be guaranteed under
different circumstances, for instance when investigating rubber friction. The
results of the simulations may provide guidelines for a systematic improvement
of the theory.

used to determine cosmological distance ratios, which in turn depend on the
expansion history. Hence, such systems are viewed as potential tools for
constraining cosmological parameters. Here we show that in lens systems with
two distinct source redshifts, of which the nearest one contributes to the
light deflection towards the more distant one, there exists an invariance
transformation which leaves all strong lensing observables unchanged (except
the product of time delay and Hubble constant), generalizing the well-known
mass-sheet transformation in single plane lens systems. The transformation
preserves the relative distribution of mass and light, so that a
`mass-follows-light' assumption does not fix the MST. All time delays (from
sources on both planes) scale with the same factor -- time-delay ratios are
therefore invariant under the MST. Changing cosmological parameters, and thus
distance ratios, is essentially equivalent to such a mass-sheet transformation.
As an example, we discuss the double source plane system SDSSJ0946+1006, which
has been recently studied by Collett and Auger, and show that variations of
cosmological parameters within reasonable ranges lead to only a small
mass-sheet transformation in both lens planes. Hence, the ability to extract
cosmological information from such systems depends heavily on the ability to
break the mass-sheet degeneracy.

different for other singularities. In this paper we show that a big freeze
singularity in general relativity (GR) can in some cases be smoothed to a
sudden or a type IV singularity under the EiBI scenario. Similarly, a sudden or
a type IV singularity in GR can be replaced in some regions of the parameter
space by a type IV singularity or a loitering behaviour, respectively, in the
EiBI framework. Furthermore, we find that the auxiliary metric related to the
physical connection usually has a smoother behaviour than that based on the
physical metric. In addition, we show that bound structures close to a big rip
or a little rip will be destroyed before the advent of the singularity and will
remain bound close to a sudden, big freeze or type IV singularity. We then
constrain the model following a cosmographic approach, which is well-known to
be model-independent, for a given Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker
geometry. It turns out that among the various past or present singularities,
the cosmographic analysis can pick up the physical region that determines the
occurrence of a type IV singularity or a loitering effect in the past.
Moreover, to determine which of the future singularities or doomsdays is more

a new H$_2$O-CO$_2$ interaction potential is proposed and used to model the
ballistic deposition of CO$_2$ layers on water ice surfaces, and to study the
individual binding sites at low coverages. Contrary to recent experimental
results, we do not observe CO$_2$ island formation on any type of water
substrate. Additionally, density functional theory calculations are performed
to assess the importance of induced electrostatic interactions.

$s$ for which any $(1,\beta)$ FT-ABFS structure rooted at $s$ has
$\Omega(n^{1+\epsilon(\beta)})$ edges, for some function $\epsilon(\beta) \in

$\Omega(n^{5/4})$ edges. Our lower bounds are complemented by an upper bound,
showing that there exists a poly-time algorithm that for every $n$-vertex

$\pm$ 3 s and a high eccentricity of 0.772 $\pm$ 0.045. The planet transits the
main star of a metal-rich, relatively old binary system with stars of mass of
0.99 $\pm$ 0.05 Msun and 0.70 $ \pm $ 0.07 Msun for the primary and secondary,
respectively. This binary system is constrained thanks to a self-consistent
modelling of the ${\it Kepler}$ transit light curve, the SOPHIE radial
velocities, line bisector and full-width half maximum (FWHM) variations, and
the spectral energy distribution. However, future observations are needed to
confirm it. The PASTIS fully-Bayesian software was used to validate the nature
of the planet and to determine which star of the binary system is the transit
host. By accounting for the dilution from the binary both in photometry and in
radial velocity, we find that the planet has a mass of 1.45 $ \pm $ 0.35 Mjup,
and a radius of 0.94 $ \pm $ 0.12 Rjup, and thus a bulk density of 2.1 $ \pm $

making it one of the few known members of the warm-jupiter population. The

simultaneously with a joint amateur and professional photometric follow-up,

instrumental response function and increase of the statistics, the
observational uncertainties of the spectrum in $\sim$100-300 MeV bands and
$>10$GeV bands are significantly improved. The present data analysis suggests
that the 0.1-100GeV emissions from LS~5039 contain three different components;
(i) the first component contributes to $<$1GeV emissions around superior
conjunction, (ii) the second component dominates in 1-10GeV energy bands and
(iii) the third component is compatible to lower energy tail of the TeV
emissions. In the second part, we develop an emission model to explain the
properties of the phase-resolved emissions in multi-wavelength observations.
Assuming that LS~5039 includes a pulsar, we argue that both emissions from
magnetospheric outer gap and inverse-Compton scattering process of
cold-relativistic pulsar wind contribute to the observed GeV emissions. We
assume that the pulsar is wrapped by two kinds of termination shock; Shock-I
due to the interaction between the pulsar wind and the stellar wind and
Shock-II due to the effect of the orbital motion. We propose that the X-rays
are produced by the synchrotron radiation at Shock-I region and the TeV

magnetohydrodynamics. Previous investigations of particle acceleration for this
CMT model focused on the non-relativistic energy regime. It is the specific aim
of this Research Note to extend the previous work to relativistic particle
energies. Particle orbits were calculated numerically using the relativistic
guiding centre equations. We also calculated particle orbits using the
non-relativistic guiding centre equations for comparison. For mildly
relativistic energies the relativistic and non-relativistic particle orbits
mainly agree well, but clear deviations are seen for higher energies. In
particular, the final particle energies obtained from the relativistic
calculations are systematically lower than the energies reached from the
corresponding non-relativistic calculations, and the mirror points of the
relativistic orbits are systematically higher than for the corresponding
non-relativistic orbits. While the overall behaviour of particle orbits in CMTs
does not differ qualitatively when using the relativistic guiding centre
equations, there are a few systematic quantitative differences between
relativistic and non-relativistic particle dynamics.

by impurity-atom doping below 10 at.%. The dopant atoms were B and N for
diamond, Be, Si, and C for cBN, and Be and C for hBN. It was found that the
Fermi level was located at the valence band maximum or the conduction band
minimum in the following seven cases: (i) the B concentration was 0.3 at.% in
B-doped diamond, (ii) the N concentration was 0.4 at.% in N-doped diamond,
(iii) the concentration of Be substituting B was 0.9 at.% in cBN, (iv) the
concentration of Si substituting B was 0.3 at.% in cBN, (v) the concentration
of C substituting B was 0.3 at.% in cBN, (vi) the concentration of C
substituting N was 0.9 at.% in cBN, and (vii) the concentration of Be
substituting B was ~2 at.% in hBN. Each of these values indicates the critical
dopant concentration for semiconductor-to-metal transition. In B-doped diamond,
it serves a measure for the occurrence of superconductivity at low temperature.

to play an important role in the maintenance of massive galaxies in the
present-day Universe. We study the link between radio emission and the
properties of the central black hole in a large sample of local radio galaxies
drawn from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), based on the catalogue of Best
and Heckman (2012). Our sample is mainly dominated by massive black holes
(mostly in the range $10^8-10^9 M_{\odot}$) accreting at very low Eddington
ratios (typically $\lambda < 0.01$). In broad agreement with previously
reported trends, we find that radio galaxies are preferentially associated with
the more massive black holes, and that the radio loudness parameter seems to
increase with decreasing Eddington ratio. We compare our results with previous
studies in the literature, noting potential biases. The majority of the local
radio galaxies in our sample are currently in a radiatively inefficient
accretion regime, where kinetic feedback dominates over radiative feedback. We
discuss possible physical interpretations of the observed trends in the context
of a two-stage feedback process involving a transition in the underlying
accretion modes.

is modelled by varying the lengths of constituent tether elements. Dynamic

combining it with the automatic control system used for the operation of a kite

The four point model can better predict the influence of gravity and inertia on

simple one point models, the proposed framework is more accurate and robust

sample of short period comets and their dynamical history. With this aim, we
characterized the dust tails when the comets are active, and we made a
statistical study to determine their dynamical evolution. The targets selected
were 22P/Kopff, 30P/Reinmuth 1, 78P/Gehrels 2, 115P/Maury, 118P/Shoemaker-Levy
4, 123P/West-Hartley, 157P/Tritton, 185/Petriew, and P/2011 W2 (Rinner).
Methods. We use two different observational data: a set of images taken at the
Observatorio de Sierra Nevada and the Afrho curves provided by the amateur
astronomical association Cometas-Obs. To model these observations, we use our
Monte Carlo dust tail code. From this analysis, we derive the dust parameters,
which best describe the dust environment: dust loss rates, ejection velocities,
and size distribution of particles. On the other hand, we use a numerical
integrator to study the dynamical history of the comets, which allows us to
determine with a 90% of confidence level the time spent by these objects in the
region of Jupiter Family Comets. Results. From the Monte Carlo dust tail code,
we derived three categories attending to the amount of dust emitted: Weakly
active (115P, 157P, and Rinner), moderately active (30P, 123P, and 185P), and
highly active (22P, 78P, and 118P). The dynamical studies showed that the
comets of this sample are young in the Jupiter Family region, where the
youngest ones are 22P (100 yr), 78P (500 yr), and 118P (600 yr). The study
points to a certain correlation between comet activity and time spent in the
Jupiter Family region, although this trend is not always fulfilled. The largest
particle sizes are not tightly constrained, so that the total dust mass derived
should be regarded as lower limits.}

surface of Bi$_2$Se$_3$ and reproduce all the main features of the recent
experimental results, i.e., the incomplete current saturation and the finite
residual conductance in the high applied field regime [Costache {\it et al.},
Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 112}, 086601 (2014)]. Due to the hot-electron effect, the
conductance decreases and the current shows the tendency of the saturation with
the increase of the applied electric field. Moreover, the electric field can
excite carriers within the surface bands through interband precession and leads
to a higher conductance. As a joint effect of the hot-electron transport and
the carrier excitation, the conductance approaches a finite residual value in
the high-field regime and the current saturation becomes incomplete. We thus
demonstrate that, contrary to the conjecture in the literature, the observed
transport phenomena can be understood qualitatively in the framework of surface
transport alone. Furthermore, if a constant bulk conductance which is
insensitive to the field is introduced, one can obtain a good quantitative
agreement between the theoretical results and the experimental data.

bodies that have negative material parameters. Such material parameters are
used to model metals on optical frequencies and so-called metamaterials. As the
absorption of the materials in the model tends to zero the fields may blow up.
When the speed of the blow up is suitable, this is called the Anomalous
Localized Reconance (ALR). In this paper we study this phenomenon and formulate
a new condition, the weak Anomalous Localized Reconance (w-ALR), where the
speed of the blow up of fields may be slower. Using this concept, we can study
the blow up of fields in the presence of negative material parameters without
the commonly used quasi-static approximation. We give simple geometric
conditions under which w-ALR or ALR may, or may not appear. In particular, we
show that in a case of a curved layer of negative material with a strictly
convex boundary neither ALR nor w-ALR appears with non-zero frequencies (i.e.
in the dynamic range) in dimensions $d\ge 3$. In the case when the boundary of
the negative material contains a flat subset we show that the w-ALR always
happens with some point sources in dimensions $d\ge 2$. These results, together
with the earlier results of Milton et al. ( [22, 23]) and Ammari et al. ([2])
show that for strictly convex bodies ALR may appear only for bodies so small
that the quasi-static approximation is realistic. This gives limits for size of
the objects for which invisibility cloaking methods based on ALR may be used.

continuously with $T$ and has a purely classical origin. This positive MR is

double-quantum-dot (DQD) Aharonov-Bohm (AB) interferometer with spin-orbit

dynamics of spin transport is expressed by effective magnetic fluxes.
Analytical formulae for the time-dependent currents, for initially unpolarized
spins, are presented. In many cases, there appear spin currents in the
electrodes, for which the spins in each electrode are polarized along
characteristic directions, pre-determined by the SOI parameters and by the
geometry of the system. Special choices of the system parameters yield
steady-state currents in which the spins are fully polarized along these
characteristic directions. The time required to reach this steady state depends
on the couplings of the DQD to the leads. The magnitudes of the currents depend
strongly on the SOI-induced effective fluxes. Without the magnetic flux, the
spin-polarized current cannot be sustained to the steady states, due to the
phase rigidity for this system. For a non-degenerate DQD, transient spin
transport can be produced by the sole effects of SOI. We also show that one can
extract the spin-resolved currents from measurements of the total charge
current.

a discrepancy of order $((\log N)^d)/N$ ($d$ is the dimension of the space
where the sequence lies), are a fundamental tool for getting faster rate of
convergence in approximation involving Quasi-Monte Carlo methods. The
objectives of this work can be summarized as follows
  (1)The research of explicit techniques for introducing new classes of u.d.
sequences of points and of partitions on $[0,1]$ and also on fractal sets
  (2) A quantitative analysis of the distribution behaviour of a class of
generalized Kakutani's sequences on $[0,1]$ through the study of their

partitions and of points on fractals generated by an Iterated Function System
(IFS) of similarities having the same ratio and satisfying a natural separation
condition of their components called Open Set Condition (OSC). We also provide
an estimate for the elementary discrepancy of these sequences.
  We generalize these results to a wider class of fractals by using a recent
generalization of Kakutani's splitting procedure on $[0,1]$, namely the
technique of $\rho-$refinements. First, we focus on (2) and get precise bounds
for the discrepancy of a large class of generalized Kakutani's sequences,
exploiting a correspondence between the tree representation associated to
successive $\rho-$refinements and the tree generated by Khodak's coding
algorithm. Then we adapt the $\rho-$refinements method to the new class of
fractals and prove bounds for the elementary discrepancy of the sequences of

energy harvesting wireless networks has recently received considerable
attention, thus requiring for an accurate modeling of the energy harvesting
process and a consequent redesign of the simulation framework to include it.
While the current ns-3 energy framework allows the definition of new energy
sources that incorporate the contribution of an energy harvester, the
integration of an energy harvester component into an existing energy source is
not straightforward using the existing energy framework. In this poster, we
propose an extension of the energy framework currently released with ns-3 in
order to explicitly introduce the concept of an energy harvester. Starting from
the definition of the general interface, we then provide the implementation of
two simple models for the energy harvester. In addition, we extend the set of
implementations of the current energy framework to include a model for a
supercapacitor energy source and a device energy model for the energy
consumption of a sensor. Finally, we introduce the concept of an energy
predictor, that gathers information from the energy source and harvester and
use this information to predict the amount of energy that will be available in
the future, and we provide an example implementation. As a result of these
efforts, we believe that our contributions to the ns-3 energy framework will

an apparent lack of old (> 1 Gyr) open clusters in the solar neighbourhood (< 1

clusters, assuming that the missing old clusters reside at high Galactic
latitudes |b|> 20{\deg}. We were looking for stellar density enhancements using
a star count algorithm on the 2MASS point source catalogue. To increase the
contrast between potential clusters and the field, we applied filters in
colour-magnitude space according to typical colour-magnitude diagrams of nearby
old open clusters. The subsequent comparison with lists of known objects
allowed us to select thus far unknown cluster candidates. For verification they
were processed with the standard pipeline used within the MWSC survey for
computing cluster membership probabilities and for determining structural,
kinematic, and astrophysical parameters. In total we discovered 782 density
enhancements, 522 of which were classified as real objects. Among them 139 are
new open clusters with ages 8.3 < log (t [yr]) < 9.7, distances d < 3 kpc, and
distances from the Galactic plane 0.3 < Z < 1 kpc. This new sample has
increased the total number of known high latitude open clusters by about 150%.
Nevertheless, we still observe a lack of older nearby clusters up to 1 kpc from
the Sun. This volume is expected to still contain about 60 unknown clusters
that probably escaped our detection algorithm, which fails to detect sparse
overdensities with large angular size.

two dimensions. Lattice QED theory with U(1) group symmetry in two dimensional
space-times dimensions has always been a testing ground for algorithms. By the
other side, motivated by our previews work that the two-grid algorithm converge
faster than the standard iterative methods for overlap inversion but not for
all quark masses, we thought to test this idea in less dimensions such as U(1)
gauge theory. Our main objective of this paper it is to implement and develop
the idea of a two level algorithm in a new algorithm coded in QCDLAB. This
implementation is presented in the preconditioned GMRESR algorithm, as our new
contribution in QCDLAB package. The preconditioned part of our algorithm,
different from the one of [18], is the approximation of the overlap operator
with the truncated overlap operator with finite N3 dimension. We have tested it
for 100 statistically independent configurations on 32 x 32 lattice background
U(1) field at coupling constant \b{eta}=1 and for different bare quark masses
mq = [0.5, 0.45, 0.4, 0.35, 0.3, 0.25, 0.2, 0.15, 0.1]. We have compared the
convergence history of the preconditioned GMRESR residual norm with another
overlap inverter of QCDLAB as an optimal one, such as SHUMR. We have shown that
our algorithm converges faster than SHUMR for different quark masses. Also, we
have demonstrated that it saves more time for light quarks compared to SHUMR
algorithm. Our algorithm is approximately independent from the quark mass. This
is a key result in simulations with chiral fermions in lattice theories. By the
other side, if we compare the results of [18] for quark mass 0.1 in SU(3),
results that our chosen preconditioned saves a factor of 2 but in U(1). Our
next step is to test this algorithm in SU(3) and to adopt it in parallel.

such as from the Planck satellite, the metrology of polarization needs to
improve. In particular, it is crucial to take into account full knowledge of
the noise properties when estimating polarization fraction and angle, which
suffer from well-known biases. While strong simplifying assumptions have
usually been made in polarization analysis, we present a method for including
the full covariance matrix of the Stokes parameters in estimates for the
distributions of the polarization fraction and angle. We thereby quantify the
impact of the noise properties on the biases in the observational quantities.
We derive analytical expressions for the pdf of these quantities, taking into
account the full complexity of the covariance matrix, including the Stokes I
intensity components. We perform simulations to explore the impact of the noise
properties on the statistical variance and bias of the polarization fraction
and angle. We show that for low variations of the effective ellipticity between
the Q and U components around the symmetrical case the covariance matrix may be
simplified as is usually done, with negligible impact on the bias. For S/N on
intensity lower than 10 the uncertainty on the total intensity is shown to
drastically increase the uncertainty of the polarization fraction but not the
relative bias, while a 10\% correlation between the intensity and the polarized
components does not significantly affect the bias of the polarization fraction.
We compare estimates of the uncertainties affecting polarization measurements,
addressing limitations of estimates of the S/N, and we show how to build
conservative confidence intervals for polarization fraction and angle
simultaneously. This study is the first of a set of papers dedicated to the
analysis of polarization measurements.

importance in the motor function of gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Intestinal
wall motions depend on myogenic-active properties of smooth muscles layers of
intestinal wall, which is the ability to create active contractile forces in
response to distension. Considering the stress in the circular and longitudinal
smooth muscles as a sum of passive, depending on muscle deformations, and
active, depending on muscle tone, components, and also assuming that the change
in the muscle tone depends on the current stress-strain condition, the system
of four ordinary differential equations (ODE) is obtained, which describes
filling-emptying cycle of intestinal segment as a process of coordinated
activities of circular and longitudinal muscles of intestinal wall. A general
approach in formulating the modelling conditions is based on the previously
described model restricted to the circularly distensible reservoir of constant
length. Obtained results illustrate the character of coordinated activities of
two orthogonal muscle layers, which are alternating phases of reciprocally and
uniformly changing modalities such as stretching of the wall and muscle tone.

Auerbach's and Meisner's intermuscular and submucous neural plexuses in

  nanostructures for thin-film solar cells",,"10.1088/2040-8978/17/2/025102",,"physics.optics cond-mat.mtrl-sci","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Recently, we have suggested dielectric metamaterial composed as an array of
submicron dielectric spheres located on top of an amorphous thin-film solar
cell. We have theoretically shown that this metamaterial can decrease the
reflection and simultaneously can suppress the transmission through the
photovoltaic layer because it transforms the incident plane wave into a set of
focused light beams. This theoretical concept has been strongly developed and
experimentally confirmed in the present paper. Here we consider the
metamaterial for oblique angle illumination, redesign the solar cell and
present a detailed experimental study of the whole structure. In contrast to
our precedent theoretical study we show that our omnidirectional light-trapping
structure may operate better than the optimized flat coating obtained by
plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition.

$\mathcal R$ of the class induces a collection $\{\mathcal R_k\}_{k<\omega}$ of
projected spaces which have the property that every Baire set is Ramsey. Every
projected space $\mathcal R_k$ is a subspace of the corresponding space of
length-$k$ approximation sequences with the Tychonoff, equivalently metric,
topology.
  This answers a question of S. Todorcevic and generalizes the results of
Carlson \cite{Carlson}, Carlson-Simpson \cite{CarSim2}, Pr\""omel-Voigt
\cite{PromVoi}, and Voigt \cite{Voigt}. We also present a new family of
topological Ramsey spaces contained in the aforementioned class which
generalize the spaces of ascending parameter words of Carlson-Simpson
\cite{CarSim2} and Pr\""omel-Voigt \cite{PromVoi} and the spaces
$\FIN_m^{[\infty]}$, $0<m<\omega$, of block sequences defined by Todorcevic
\cite{Todo}.

information-theoretical approach using cross-entropy instead of the Lagrange
multiplier approach which is universal in machine learning literature. The
proposed approach provides a more concise derivation of the Baum-Welch method
and naturally generalizes to multiple observations.

In
this work, we study the records statistics of the time series of select stock
market data and the geometric random walk, primarily through simulations. We
show that the distribution of the age of records is a power law with the
exponent $\alpha$ lying in the range $1.5 \le \alpha \le 1.8$. Further, the
longest record ages follow the Fr\'{e}chet distribution of extreme value
theory. The records statistics of geometric random walk series is in good
agreement with that from the empirical stock data.
