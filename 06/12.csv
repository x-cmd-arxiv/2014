whether it is possible to transmit quantum information at a rate exceeding the
channel capacity if we allow for a non-vanishing probability of decoding error.
Here we establish that the Rains information of any quantum channel is a strong
converse rate for quantum communication: For any sequence of codes with rate
exceeding the Rains information of the channel, we show that the fidelity
vanishes exponentially fast as the number of channel uses increases. This
remains true even if we consider codes that perform classical post-processing
on the transmitted quantum data. As an application of this result, for
generalized dephasing channels we show that the Rains information is also
achievable, and thereby establish the strong converse property for quantum
communication over such channels. Thus we conclusively settle the strong
converse question for a class of quantum channels that have a non-trivial
quantum capacity.

cannot exceed $\frac{1}{2}$, which is the exponent of quasigroup operations. We
also study the polarization of multiple access channels (MAC). In particular,
we show that a sequence of binary operations is MAC-polarizing if and only if
each binary operation in the sequence is polarizing. It is shown that the
exponent of any MAC-polarizing sequence cannot exceed $\frac{1}{2}$, which is
the exponent of sequences of quasigroup operations.

is to compute the essential dimension of $\operatorname{GL}_n/\mu_m$, i.e., the
essential dimension of a generic division algebra of degree $n$ and exponent
dividing $m$. In this paper we study the essential dimension of groups of the
form \[ G=(\operatorname{GL}_{n_1} \times \dots \times
\operatorname{GL}_{n_r})/C \, , \] where $C$ is a central subgroup of
$\operatorname{GL}_{n_1} \times \dots \times \operatorname{GL}_{n_r}$.
Equivalently, we are interested in the essential dimension of a generic
$r$-tuple $(A_1, \dots, A_r)$ of central simple algebras such that
$\operatorname{deg}(A_i) = n_i$ and the Brauer classes of $A_1, \dots, A_r$
satisfy a system of homogeneous linear equations in the Brauer group. The
equations depend on the choice of $C$ via the error-correcting code
$\operatorname{Code}(C)$ which we naturally associate to $C$. We focus on the
case where $n_1, \dots, n_r$ are powers of the same prime. The upper and lower
bounds on $\operatorname{ed}(G)$ we obtain are expressed in terms of
coding-theoretic parameters of $\operatorname{Code}(C)$, such as its weight
distribution. Surprisingly, for many groups of the above form the essential
dimension becomes easier to estimate when $r \geq 3$; in some cases we even
compute the exact value. The Appendix by Athena Nguyen contains an explicit
description of the Galois cohomology of groups of the form

magnetization at a given field, have been previously reported in the spin-ice
compound Dy$_{2}$Ti$_{2}$O$_{7}$. This out-of-equilibrium process, induced by
magneto-thermal heating, is quite usual in low temperature magnetization
studies. A key point is to determine the physical origin of the avalanche
process. In particular, in spin-ice compounds, the origin of the avalanches
might be related to the monopole physics inherent to the system. We have
performed a detailed study of the avalanche phenomena in three single crystals,
with the field oriented along the [111] direction, perpendicular to [111] and
along the [100] directions. We have measured the changing magnetization during
the avalanches and conclude that avalanches in spin ice are quite slow compared
to the avalanches reported in other systems such as molecular magnets. Our
measurements show that the avalanches trigger after a delay of about 500 ms and
that the reversal of the magnetization then occurs in a few hundreds of
milliseconds. These features suggest an unusual propagation of the reversal,
which might be due to the monopole motion. The avalanche fields seem to be
reproducible in a given direction for different samples, but they strongly
depend on the initial state of magnetization and on how the initial state was
achieved.

models used to construct them. We characterize such galaxy history ensembles
both to understand their properties and to identify points of comparison for
histories within a given galaxy formation model or between different galaxy
formation models and simulations. We focus primarily on stellar mass histories
of galaxies with the same final stellar mass, for six final stellar mass values
and for three different simulated galaxy formation models (a semi-analytic
model built upon the dark matter Millennium simulation and two models from the
hydrodynamical OverWhelmingly Large Simulations project). Using principal
component analysis (PCA) to classify scatter around the average stellar mass
history, we find that one fluctuation dominates for all sets of histories we
consider, although its shape and contribution can vary between samples. We
correlate the PCA characterization with several $z=0$ galaxy properties (to
connect with survey observables) and also compare it to some other galaxy
history properties. We then explore separating galaxy stellar mass histories
into classes, using the largest PCA contribution, k-means clustering, and
simple Gaussian mixture models. For three component models, these different
methods often gave similar results. These history classification methods
provide a succinct and often quick way to characterize changes in the full
ensemble of histories of a simulated population as physical assumptions are
varied, to compare histories of different simulated populations to each other,
and to assess the relation of simulated histories to fixed time observations.

states in condensed matter physics at low temperatures are described by the
complex function $\Psi({\bf r}, t)$. These states include superfluids,
superconductors, and a subclass of antiferromagnets and charge-density waves.
The collective fluctuations in the ordered state may then be categorized as
oscillations of phase and amplitude of $\Psi({\bf r}, t)$. The phase
oscillations are the {\it Goldstone} modes of the broken continuous symmetry.
The amplitude modes, even at long wavelengths, are well defined and decoupled
from the phase oscillations only near particle-hole symmetry, where the
equations of motion have an effective Lorentz symmetry as in particle physics,
and if there are no significant avenues for decay into other excitations. They
bear close correspondence with the so-called {\it Higgs} modes in particle
physics, whose prediction and discovery is very important for the standard
model of particle physics. In this review, we discuss the theory and the
possible observation of the amplitude or Higgs modes in condensed matter
physics -- in superconductors, cold-atoms in periodic lattices, and in uniaxial
antiferromagnets. We discuss the necessity for at least approximate
particle-hole symmetry as well as the special conditions required to couple to
such modes because, being scalars, they do not couple linearly to the usual
condensed matter probes.

arising in many real applications, such as image inpainting, compressive
sensing and medical imaging, and this kind of problems are mostly formulated as
low-rank matrix approximation problems. Due to the rank operator being
non-convex and discontinuous, most of the recent theoretical studies use the
nuclear norm as a convex relaxation and the low-rank matrix recovery problem is
solved through minimization of the nuclear norm regularized problem. However, a
major limitation of nuclear norm minimization is that all the singular values
are simultaneously minimized and the rank may not be well approximated
\cite{hu2012fast}. Correspondingly, in this paper, we propose a new multi-stage
algorithm, which makes use of the concept of Truncated Nuclear Norm
Regularization (TNNR) proposed in \citep{hu2012fast} and Iterative Support
Detection (ISD) proposed in \citep{wang2010sparse} to overcome the above
limitation. Besides matrix completion problems considered in
\citep{hu2012fast}, the proposed method can be also extended to the general
low-rank matrix recovery problems. Extensive experiments well validate the

Second, building on the work of Hastings [Phys. Rev. B 73, 085115 (2006)], we
derive a polynomial scaling relation, $D=\left(N/\epsilon\right)^{O(\beta)}$.
This implies that the manifold of PEPS forms an efficient representation of
Gibbs states of local quantum Hamiltonians. From those bounds it also follows
that ground states can be approximated with $D=N^{O(\log(N))}$ whenever the

excitation and the following inter-system crossing. Especially for a
spin-bearing molecule, an exchange interaction between the triplet exciton and
the original spin on the molecule can be expected. In this paper, such exchange
interaction in copper-phthalocyanine (CuPc, spin-$\frac{1}{2}$) was
investigated from first-principles by using density-functional theory within a
variety of approximations to the exchange correlation, ranging from
local-density approximation to long-range corrected hybrid-exchange functional.
The magnitude of the computed exchange interaction is in the order of meV with
the minimum value (1.5 meV, ferromagnetic) given by the long-range corrected
hybrid-exchange functional CAM-B3LYP. This exchange interaction can therefore
give rise to a spin coherence with an oscillation period in the order of
picoseconds, which is much shorter than the triplet lifetime in CuPc (typically
tens of nanoseconds). This implies that it might be possible to manipulate the
localised spin on Cu experimentally using optical excitation and inter-system
crossing well before the triplet state disappears.

mean motion is crucial for numerous applications of acoustic microfluidics,
including particle manipulation and flow visualisation. It is controlled by
four physical effects: acoustic (radiation) pressure, streaming, inertia and
viscous drag. In this paper, we carry out a systematic multiscale analysis of

reveals a new nonlinear dynamical regime. In this regime, the mean motion of
the particle remains intimately coupled to that of the surrounding fluid, and
while viscosity affects the fluid motion, it plays no part in the acoustic
pressure. Simplified equations, valid when only two physical effects control
the particle motion, are also derived. They are used to obtain sufficient

operator as it admits real eigenvalues. This stems from the fact that any
measuring apparatus that is supposed to measure a physical observable will
always yield a real number. However, reality of eigenvalue of some operator
does not mean that it is necessarily Hermitian. There are examples of
non-Hermitian operators which may admit real eigenvalues under some symmetry
conditions. However, in general, given a non-Hermitian operator, its average
value in a quantum state is a complex number and there are only very limited
methods available to measure it. Following standard quantum mechanics, we
provide an experimentally feasible protocol to measure the expectation value of
any non-Hermitian operator via weak measurements. The average of a
non-Hermitian operator in a pure state is a complex multiple of the weak value
of the positive semi-definite part of the non-Hermitian operator. We also prove
a new uncertainty relation for any two non-Hermitian operators and show that
the fidelity of a quantum state under quantum channel can be measured using the
average of the corresponding Kraus operators. The importance of our method is
shown in testing the stronger uncertainty relation, verifying the Ramanujan
formula and in measuring the product of non commuting projectors.

reveal the system's dynamics, we complement this lensing analysis with a study
of the intra-cluster gas using shallow Chandra data, and a three-dimensional
model of the distribution and motions of cluster galaxies derived from over 100
spectroscopic redshifts. The multi-scale grid model obtained from our combined
lensing analysis extends the high-precision strong-lensing mass reconstruction
recently performed to cluster-centric distances of almost 1 Mpc. Our analysis
detects the two well known mass concentrations in the cluster core. A
pronounced offset between collisional and collisionless matter is only observed
for the SW cluster component, while excellent alignment is found for the NE
cluster. Both the lensing analysis and the distribution of cluster light
strongly suggest the presence of a third massive structure, almost 2 arcmin SW
of the cluster centre. Since no X-ray emission is detected in this region, we
conclude that this structure is non-virialised and speculate that it might be
part of a large-scale filament almost aligned with our line of sight. Combining
all evidence from the distribution of dark and luminous matter, we propose two
alternative scenarios for the trajectories of the components of
MACSJ0416.1-2403. Upcoming deep X-ray observations that allow the detection of
shock fronts, cold cores, and sloshing gas (all key diagnostics for studies of
cluster collisions) will allow us to test, and distinguish between these two

exoplanet catalogs have been used to make an extrapolated estimate of the rate
at which Sun-like stars host Earth analogs. These studies are complicated by
the fact that every catalog is censored by non-trivial selection effects and
detection efficiencies, and every property (period, radius, etc.) is measured
noisily. Here we present a general hierarchical probabilistic framework for
making justified inferences about the population of exoplanets, taking into
account survey completeness and, for the first time, observational
uncertainties. We are able to make fewer assumptions about the distribution
than previous studies; we only require that the occurrence rate density be a
smooth function of period and radius (employing a Gaussian process). By
applying our method to synthetic catalogs, we demonstrate that it produces more
accurate estimates of the whole population than standard procedures based on
weighting by inverse detection efficiency. We apply the method to an existing
catalog of small planet candidates around G dwarf stars (Petigura et al. 2013).
We confirm a previous result that the radius distribution changes slope near
Earth's radius. We find that the rate density of Earth analogs is about 0.02

uncertainty. This number is much smaller than previous estimates made with the

of $\sim 10^9\,{\rm M}_{\odot}$ SMBHs observed as luminous quasars at redshifts
$z> 6$ in particular, remains an open fundamental question. The presence of
such massive BHs at such early times, when the Universe was less than a billion
years old, implies that they grew via either super-Eddington accretion, or
nearly uninterrupted gas accretion near the Eddington limit; the latter, at
first glance, is at odds with empirical trends at lower redshifts, where quasar
episodes associated with rapid BH growth are rare and brief. In this work, I
examine whether and to what extent the growth of the $z> 6$ quasar SMBHs can be
explained within the standard quasar paradigm, in which major mergers of host
galaxies trigger episodes of rapid gas accretion below or near the Eddington
limit. Using a suite of Monte Carlo merger tree simulations of the assembly
histories of the likely hosts of the $z> 6$ quasars, I investigate (i) their
growth and major merger rates out to $z\sim 40$, and (ii) how long the feeding
episodes induced by host mergers must last in order to explain the observed $z>
6$ quasar population without super-Eddington accretion. The halo major merger
rate scales roughly as $\propto (1+z)^{5/2}$, with quasar hosts typically
experiencing $> 10$ major mergers between $15> z > 6$ ($\approx 650\,{\rm
Myr}$), compared to $\sim 1$ for typical massive galaxies at $3>z > 0$
($\approx 11 \,{\rm Gyr}$). An example of a viable sub-Eddington SMBH growth
model is one where a host merger triggers feeding for a duration comparable to
the halo dynamical time. These findings suggest that the growth mechanisms of
the earliest quasar SMBHs need not have been drastically different from their
counterparts at lower redshifts.

induced quantum corrections in the effective metallic regime above the critical
density of the so-called two-dimensional metal-insulator transition (2D MIT).
The goal is to look for the effect of logarithmic insulating localization
correction to the metallic temperature dependence in the 2D conductivity so as
to distinguish between the 2D MIT being a true quantum phase transition versus
being a finite-temperature crossover. We use the Boltzmann theory of
resistivity including the temperature dependent screening effect on charged
impurities in the system to fit the data. We analyze weak perpendicluar field
magnetoresistance data taken in the vicinity of the transition and show that
they are consistent with weak localization behavior in the strongly disordered
regime $k_F\ell\gtrsim1$. Therefore we supplement the Botzmann transport theory
with a logarithmic in temperature quantum weak localization correction and
analyze the competition of the insulating temperature dependence of this
correction with the metallic temperature dependence of the Boltzmann
conductivity. Using this minimal theoretical model we find that the logarithmic
insulating correction is masked by the metallic temperature dependence of the
Botzmann resistivity and therefore the insulating $\log T$ behavior may be
apparent only at very low temperatures which are often beyond the range of
temperatures accessible experimentally. Analyzing the low-$T$ experimental Si
MOSFET transport data we identify signatures of the putative insulating
behavior at low temperature and density in the effective metallic phase.

dying low-mass stars plays an important role in preventing star formation in
quiescent galaxies. At the end of their asymptotic giant branch phase,
intermediate and low-mass stars eject their envelopes rapidly in a super-wind
phase, usually giving rise to planetary nebulae. In spheroidal galaxies with
high stellar velocity dispersions, the interaction of these ejected envelopes
with the ambient diffuse gas can lead to significant, isotropic and
steady-state heating that scales as $\dot{M}_\ast\sigma_\ast^2$. We show that
cooling of the central regions of the hot diffuse halo gas can be delayed for a
Hubble time for halos more massive than $\sim10^{12.5}M_{\odot}$ at $0<z<2$,
although stellar heating alone is unlikely to forestall cooling in the most
massive clusters at $z=0$. This mechanism provides a natural explanation for
the strong trend of galaxy quiescence with stellar surface density and velocity
dispersion. In addition, since the ejected material will thermalize to
$kT\sim\sigma_\ast^2$, this mechanism provides an explanation for the observed
similarity between the central temperature of the hot diffuse gas and
$\sigma_\ast^2$, a result which is not trivial in light of the short inferred
cooling times of the hot gas. The main uncertainty in this analysis is the
ultimate fate of the stellar ejecta. Preventing accumulation of the ejecta in
the central regions may require energy input from another source, such as Type
Ia supernovae. Detailed simulations of the interaction of the stellar wind with

the full backreaction from Landau damping of the boson, and obtains an RG flow
that proceeds through three distinct stages. Above the scale of Landau damping
the Fermi velocity flows to zero, while the coupling evolves according to its
classical dimension. Once damping becomes important, its backreaction leads to
a crossover regime where dynamic and static damping effects compete and the
fermion self-energy does not respect scaling. Below this crossover and having
tuned the boson to criticality, the theory flows to a $z=3$ scalar interacting
with a NFL. By increasing the number of bosonic flavors, the phase diagram near
the quantum critical point interpolates between a superconducting dome fully
covering the NFL behavior, and a phase where NFL effects become important
first, before the onset of superconductivity. A generic prediction of the
theory is that the Fermi velocity and quasiparticle residue vanish with a
power-law $\omega^\epsilon$ as the fixed point is approached. These features
may be useful for understanding some of the phenomenology of high $T_c$

N103B, a young Type Ia supernova remnant in the Large Magellanic Cloud that
shows interaction with a dense medium in its western hemisphere. Our images
show that N103B has strong IR emission from warm dust in the post-shock
environment. The post-shock gas density we derive, 45 cm$^{-3}$, is much higher
than in other Type Ia remnants in the LMC, though a lack of spatial resolution
may bias measurements towards regions of higher than average density. This
density is similar to that in Kepler's SNR, a Type Ia interacting with a
circumstellar medium. Optical images show H$\alpha$ emission along the entire
periphery of the western portion of the shock, with [O III] and [S II] lines
emitted from a few dense clumps of material where the shock has become
radiative. The dust is silicate in nature, though standard silicate dust models
fail to reproduce the ""18 $\mu$m"" silicate feature that peaks instead at 17.3
$\mu$m. We propose that the dense material is circumstellar material lost from
the progenitor system, as with Kepler. If the CSM interpretation is correct,
this remnant would become the second member, along with Kepler, of a class of
Type Ia remnants characterized by interaction with a dense CSM hundreds of
years post-explosion. A lack of N enhancement eliminates symbiotic AGB
progenitors. The white dwarf companion must have been relatively unevolved at
the time of the explosion.

with VLT/FORS2. We detect a cluster-associated excess population of about 90

profile with a concentration of c200~10. Based on the Spitzer 4.5 micron
imaging data, we measure a stellar mass fraction of fstar,500=(3.3+-1.4)%
consistent with local values. The total J- and Ks-band galaxy luminosity
functions of the core region yield characteristic magnitudes J* and Ks*
consistent with expectations from simple z_f=3 burst models. However, a
detailed look at the morphologies and color distributions of the
spectroscopically confirmed members reveals that the most massive galaxies are
undergoing a very active mass assembly epoch through merging processes.
Consequently, the bright end of the cluster red-sequence is not in place, while
at intermediate magnitudes [Ks*,Ks*+1.6] a red-locus population is present,
which is then sharply truncated at magnitudes fainter than Ks*+1.6. The
dominant cluster core population comprises post-quenched galaxies transitioning
towards the red-sequence at intermediate magnitudes, while additionally a
significant blue cloud population of faint star-forming galaxies is present
even in the densest central regions. Our observations lend support to the
scenario in which the dominant effect of the dense z~1.6 cluster environment is
an accelerated mass assembly timescale through merging activity that is
responsible for driving core galaxies across the mass quenching threshold of
log(Mstar/Msun)~10.4.

the properties of distant disk galaxies. During the first ~4 Gyr of its
evolution, the MW formed stars with a high star-formation intensity (SFI),
Sigma_SFR~0.6 Msun/yr/kpc2 and as a result, generated outflows and high
turbulence in its interstellar medium. This intense phase of star formation
corresponds to the formation of the thick disk. The formation of the thick disk
is a crucial phase which enables the MW to have formed approximately half of
its total stellar mass by z~1 which is similar to ""MW progenitor galaxies""
selected by abundance matching. This agreement suggests that the formation of
the thick disk may be a generic evolutionary phase in disk galaxies. Using a
simple energy injection-kinetic energy relationship between the 1-D velocity
dispersion and SFI, we can reproduce the average perpendicular dispersion in
stellar velocities of the MW with age. This relationship, its inferred
evolution, and required efficiency are consistent with observations of galaxies
from z~0-3. The high turbulence generated by intense star formation naturally
resulted in a thick disk, a chemically well-mixed ISM, and is the mechanism
that links the evolution of MW to the observed characteristics of distant disk
galaxies.

Nuclei (AGN) in 16 intermediate redshift ($0.5 < z < 1.1$) X-ray-selected
galaxy groups in the Chandra Deep Field-South. We measure an AGN fraction of
$f(L_{X,H} > 10^{42}; M_R<-20) = 8.0_{-2.3}^{+3.0}\%$ at $\bar{z} \sim 0.74$,
approximately a factor of two higher than the AGN fraction found for rich
clusters at comparable redshift. This extends the trend found at low redshift
for groups to have higher AGN fractions than clusters. Our estimate of the AGN
fraction is also more than a factor of 3 higher than that of low redshift
X-ray-selected groups. Using optical spectra from various surveys, we also
constrain the properties of emission-line selected AGN in these groups.
Contrary to the large population of X-ray AGN ($N(L_{X,H} > 10^{41}$ erg/s) =
25), we find only 4 emission-line AGN, 3 of which are also X-ray bright.
Furthermore, most of the X-ray AGN in our groups are optically-dull (i.e. lack
strong emission-lines) similar to those found in low redshift X-ray groups and
clusters of galaxies. This contrasts with the AGN population found in low
redshift optically-selected groups which are dominated by emission-line AGN.
The differences between the optically and X-ray-selected AGN populations in
groups are consistent with a scenario where most AGN in the densest
environments are currently in a low accretion state.

of historic amino acid sequence changes responsible for creating novel
functions observed in present-day proteins. To address this problem, we
developed a new method to identify and rank amino acid mutations in ancestral
protein sequences according to their function-shifting potential. Our approach
scans the changes between two reconstructed ancestral sequences in order to
find (1) sites with sequence changes that significantly deviate from our
model-based probabilistic expectations, (2) sites that demonstrate extreme
changes in mutual information, and (3) sites with extreme gains or losses of
information content. By taking the overlaps of these statistical signals, the
method accurately identifies cryptic evolutionary patterns that are often not
obvious when examining only the conservation of modern-day protein sequences.
We validated this method with a training set of previously-discovered
function-shifting mutations in three essential protein families in animals and
fungi, whose evolutionary histories were the prior subject of systematic
molecular biological investigation. Our method identified the known
function-shifting mutations in the training set with a very low rate of false
positive discovery. Further, our approach significantly outperformed other
methods that use variability in evolutionary rates to detect functional loci.
The accuracy of our approach indicates it could be a useful tool for generating
specific testable hypotheses regarding the acquisition of new functions across
a wide range of protein families.

that the diffusion of quantum trajectories can also be of geometric nature as
characterized by the imaginary part of the geometric phase. Such an imaginary
geometric phase results from the interference of geometric phase dependent
fluctuations around the quantum trajectory. As a specific example, we study the
quantum trajectories of the optically excited electron-hole pairs, driven by an
elliptically polarized terahertz field, in a material with non-zero Berry
curvature near the energy band extremes. While the real part of the geometric
phase leads to the Faraday rotation of the linearly polarized light that

weak measurements suggest that non-classical correlations could be expressed by
complex valued quasi-probabilities, where the phases of the complex
probabilities express the action of transformations between the non-commuting
properties (H. F. Hofmann, New J. Phys. 13, 103009 (2011)). In these relations,
negative probabilities necessarily emerge whenever the physical properties
involved are related to each other by half-periodic transformations, since such

assumptions back to a fundamental and universally valid relation between
statistics and dynamics that associates half-periodic transformations with
negative probabilities.

time series of this star has been proposed to contain either a pair of signals
with periods of around 18 and 25 days, that could be due to a pair of resonant
super-Earths, or a single and varying 25 day signal that could arise due to a
complex interplay between differential rotation and modulated activity. In this

observations and they likely do not change in period, amplitude, or phase as a
function of time, the hallmarks of static Doppler signals. We show that over
the last two observing seasons this star was more intrinsically active and the
noise reddened, highlighting why better noise models are needed to find the
lowest amplitude signals, in particular models that consider noise

Each subsystem supports chiral zero energy modes when a topological index
assigned to the block is nonzero. By applying the argument to Bloch electron
systems, we detect band touching at symmetric points in the Brillouin zone. In
particular, we show that Dirac nodes appearing in honeycomb lattice (e.g.
graphene) and in half-flux square lattice are protected by three-fold and
two-fold rotation symmetry, respectively. We also present several examples of
Dirac semimetal with isolated band-touching points in three-dimensional

conventional winding number. We demonstrate that symmetry-protected band
touching points emerge even though the winding number is zero. Finally, we

Ca$_2$FeOsO$_6$ has the high-spin Fe$^{3+}$ ($3d^5$)-Os$^{5+}$ ($5d^3$) state.
The octahedral Os$^{5+}$ ion has a large intrinsic exchange splitting, and its
$t_{2g\uparrow}^3$ configuration makes the spin-orbit coupling ineffective.
Moreover, there is a strong antiferromagnetic (AF) coupling between the
neighboring Fe$^{3+}$ ($S$ = 5/2) and Os$^{5+}$ ($S$ = -3/2), but the AF
couplings within both the fcc Fe$^{3+}$ and Os$^{5+}$ sublattices are one order
of magnitude weaker. Therefore, a magnetic frustration is suppressed and a
stable ferrimagnetic (FiM) ground state appears. This FiM order is due to the
virtual hopping of the $t_{2g}$ electrons from Os$^{5+}$ ($t_{2g\downarrow}^3$)
to Fe$^{3+}$ ($t_{2g\uparrow}^3e_{g\uparrow}^2$). However, if the experimental
bended Fe$^{3+}$-O$^{2-}$-Os$^{5+}$ exchange path gets straight, the $e_g$
hopping from Fe$^{3+}$ ($t_{2g\uparrow}^3e_{g\uparrow}^2$) to Os$^{5+}$
($t_{2g\uparrow}^3$) would be facilitated and then a ferromagnetic (FM)
coupling would occur.

to use hydrostatic pressure to significantly enhance flux pinning and Tc in

also significantly enhance the irreversibility field, Hirr, by a factor of 4 at
7 K, as well as the critical current density, Jc, by up to 30 times at both low

which are mainly responsible for the Jc enhancement. In addition, we found that
the transformation from surface pinning to point pinning induced by pressure
was accompanied by a reduction of anisotropy at high temperatures. Our findings
provide an effective method to significantly enhance Tc, Jc, Hirr, and the

is a promising concept to improve user experience and resource utilization by
allowing direct transmission between two cellular devices. In this paper,
performance of network-assisted D2D communication is investigated where D2D
traffic is carried through relay nodes. Considering a multi-user and
multi-relay network, we propose a distributed solution for resource allocation
with a view to maximizing network sum-rate. An optimization problem is
formulated for radio resource allocation at the relays. The objective is to
maximize end-to-end rate as well as satisfy the data rate requirements for
cellular and D2D user equipments under total power constraint. Due to
intractability of the resource allocation problem, we propose a solution
approach using message passing technique where each user equipment sends and
receives information messages to/from the relay node in an iterative manner
with the goal of achieving an optimal allocation. Therefore, the computational
effort is distributed among all the user equipments and the corresponding relay
node. The convergence and optimality of the proposed scheme are proved and a
possible distributed implementation of the scheme in practical LTE-Advanced
networks is outlined. The numerical results show that there is a distance
threshold beyond which relay-aided D2D communication significantly improves

preprocessing for important combinatorial problems from various areas in AI. We
consider problems from Constraint Satisfaction, Global Constraints,
Satisfiability, Nonmonotonic and Bayesian Reasoning under structural
restrictions. All these problems involve two tasks: (i) identifying the
structure in the input as required by the restriction, and (ii) using the
identified structure to solve the reasoning task efficiently. We show that for
most of the considered problems, task (i) admits a polynomial-time
preprocessing to a problem kernel whose size is polynomial in a structural
problem parameter of the input, in contrast to task (ii) which does not admit
such a reduction to a problem kernel of polynomial size, subject to a
complexity theoretic assumption. As a notable exception we show that the
consistency problem for the AtMost-NValue constraint admits a polynomial kernel
consisting of a quadratic number of variables and domain values. Our results
provide a firm worst-case guarantees and theoretical boundaries for the
performance of polynomial-time preprocessing algorithms for the considered
problems.

  Multi-Bandgap Solar Cells",,,,,"physics.optics","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Creating a single bandgap solar cell that approaches the Shockley-Queisser
limit requires a highly reflective rear mirror. This mirror enhances the
voltage of the solar cell by providing photons with multiple opportunities for
escaping out the front surface. Efficient external luminescence is a
pre-requisite for high voltage. Intermediate mirrors in a multijunction solar
cell can enhance the voltage for each cell in the stack. These intermediate
mirrors need to have the added function of transmitting the below bandgap
photons to the next cell in the stack. In this work, we quantitatively
establish the efficiency increase possible with the use of intermediate
selective reflectors between cells in a tandem stack. The absolute efficiency
increase can be up to ~6% in dual bandgap cells with optimal intermediate and
rear mirrors. A practical implementation of an intermediate selective mirror is
an air gap sandwiched by antireflection coatings. The air gap provides perfect
reflection for angles outside the escape cone, and the antireflection coating
transmits angles inside the escape cone. As the incoming sunlight is within the
escape cone, it is transmitted on to the next cell, while most of the
internally trapped luminescence is reflected.

infrared excesses. These observations are explained by dust grains formed by
the collisional fragmentation of hidden planetesimals. Such dusty planetesimal
discs are known as debris discs. In a dynamically cold planetesimal disc,
collisional coagulation of planetesimals produces planetary embryos which then
stir the surrounding leftover planetesimals. Thus, the collisional
fragmentation of planetesimals that results from planet formation forms a
debris disc. We aim to determine the properties of the underlying planetesimals
in debris discs by numerically modelling the coagulation and fragmentation of
planetesimal populations. The brightness and temporal evolution of debris discs
depend on the radial distribution of planetesimal discs, the location of their
inner and outer edges, their total mass, and the size of planetesimals in the
disc. We find that a radially narrow planetesimal disc is most likely to result
in a debris disc that can explain the trend of observed infrared excesses of
debris discs around G-type stars, for which planet formation occurs only before
100 million years. Early debris disc formation is induced by planet formation,
while the later evolution is explained by the collisional decay of leftover
planetesimals around planets that have already formed. Planetesimal discs with
underlying planetesimals of radii $\sim 100\,$km at $\approx 30$ AU most
readily explain the Spitzer Space Telescope 24 and 70$ \mu$m fluxes from debris

which, it is proposed, might augment, or fully replace, the conventional
control mechanisms for pitch and yaw in certain types of aircraft. The
anticipated advantages of such a device are around 25% less drag, for a
capability which ranges between equivalent and greater than twofold that of a
conventional tail. The tail of a popular, radio-controlled, model aircraft is
replaced with a rotatable stabiliser and its rotation is effected by way of a
continuously-rotating servo, modified with a potentiometer. Two hollow,
carbon-fibre shafts (one sleeved within the other so as to allow free rotation)
serve as the mechanical link between the servo and the tail. Inserting wiring
along the full length of the innermost shaft and incorporating three slip rings
into its collar, at the forward, servo end, facilitated an electrical supply to
the tail. A mapping betweeen the position of the controls and states of the
stabiliser is formulated. Small and continuous adjustments cause the stabiliser
to rotate in the opposite direction to the controls (when viewed from aft) and
the deflection of the hinged control surface is proportional to the radial
displacement of the controls from their centred position. For what would amount
to large and contradictory rotations of the device in terms of this protocol
(rotations greater than 90$^\circ$), the desired configuration can be more
efficiently achieved by regarding the device's original orientation to differ
by 180$^\circ$ from what it actually is and by reversing the sign of the
deflection. One consequence of this latter mode of control is that a
symmetrical aerofoil is indicated. General flight, including static
longitudinal and directional stability, was not found to be compromised.

has been the main actor in thermal neutron detection for years. Starting in
about 2001 the He-3 stockpile has been declining. The world is now experiencing
the shortage of He-3. This makes the construction of large area detectors
(several squared meters) not realistic anymore. A way to reduce the He-3 demand
for those applications is to move users to alternative technologies, such as
Boron-10. Although it is absolutely necessary to replace He-3 for large area
applications, this is not the main issue for what concerns small area detectors
for which the research is focused on improving their performances. Some
technologies appear promising, though implementation would likely present
technical challenges. There are several aspects that must be investigated in
order to validate those new technologies; e.g. detection efficiency and
gamma-ray sensitivity. Several detectors, based on Boron-10 layers, have been
conceived, built and tested. We have laid a solid theoretical basis, confirmed
by experiments, for the understanding of the main aspects of solid converter
layers employed in neutron detectors. We also explored practically, by the

velocity structure of the clouds using 13CO 1-0 and 12CO 3-2 data, showing that
these IRDCs are the densest regions in massive giant molecular clouds and not
isolated features. The probability distribution function (PDF) of column
densities for all clouds have a power-law distribution over all (high) column
densities, regardless of the evolutionary stage of the cloud: G11.11-0.12,
G18.82-0.28, and G28.37+0.07 contain (proto)-stars, while G28.53-0.25 shows no
signs of star formation. This is in contrast to the purely log-normal PDFs
reported for near/mid-IR extinction maps. We only find a log-normal
distribution for lower column densities, if we perform PDFs of the column
density maps of the whole GMC in which the IRDCs are embedded. By comparing the
PDF slope and the radial column density profile, we attribute the power law to
the effect of large-scale gravitational collapse and to local free-fall
collapse of pre- and protostellar cores. Independent from the PDF analysis, we
find infall signatures in the spectral profiles of 12CO for G28.37+0.07 and
G11.11-0.12, supporting the scenario of gravitational collapse. IRDCs are the
densest regions within GMCs, which may be the progenitors of massive stars or
clusters. At least some of the IRDCs are probably the same features as ridges
(high column density regions with N>1e23 cm-2 over small areas), which were
defined for nearby IR-bright GMCs. Because IRDCs are only confined to the
densest (gravity dominated) cloud regions, the PDF constructed from this kind
of a clipped image does not represent the (turbulence dominated) low column
density regime of the cloud.

is often the nonadiabatic, weak-coupling limit, which being far from the
Born-Oppenheimer regime, provides the greatest challenge to current methods. We
show that in this limit there is an inherent sign problem impeding further
development which originates from the use of the usual quantum flux correlation
functions, which can be very oscillatory at short times. From linear response
theory, we derive a modified flux correlation function for the calculation of
nonadiabatic reaction rates, which still rigorously gives the correct result in
the long-time limit regardless of electronic coupling strength, but unlike the
usual formalism is not oscillatory in the weak-coupling regime. In particular,
a trajectory simulation of the modified correlation function is naturally
initialized in a region localized about the crossing of the potential energy
surfaces. In the weak-coupling limit, a simple link can be found between the
dynamics initialized from this transition-state region and an generalized
quantum golden-rule transition-state theory, which is equivalent to Marcus
theory in the classical harmonic limit. This new correlation function formalism
thus provides a platform on which a wide variety of dynamical simulation
methods can be built aiding the development of accurate nonadiabatic rate
theories applicable to complex systems.

a maximum for separations of order of tens of nanometers, and exhibits an

of non-relativistic Bohmian mechanics, rather than its interpretation. Although
the Bohmian and standard quantum theories have different formalisms, both give
exactly the same predictions for all phenomena. Fifteen years ago, the quantum
chemistry community began to study the practical usefulness of Bohmian
mechanics. Since then, the scientific community has mainly applied it to study
the (unitary) evolution of single-particle wave functions, either by developing
efficient quantum trajectory algorithms or by providing a trajectory-based
explanation of complicated quantum phenomena. Here we present a large list of
examples showing how the Bohmian formalism provides a useful solution in
different forefront research fields for this kind of problems (where the
Bohmian and the quantum hydrodynamic formalisms coincide). In addition, this
work also emphasizes that the Bohmian formalism can be a useful tool in other
types of (non-unitary and nonlinear) quantum problems where the influence of
the environment or the global wave function are unknown. This review contains
also examples on the use of the Bohmian formalism for the many-body problem,
decoherence and measurement processes. The ability of the Bohmian formalism to
analyze this last type of problems for (open) quantum systems remains mainly
unexplored by the scientific community. The authors of this review are
convinced that the final status of the Bohmian theory among the scientific
community will be greatly influenced by its potential success in these type of
problems that present non-unitary and/or nonlinear quantum evolutions. A brief
introduction of the Bohmian formalism and some of its extensions are presented

solar corona. Various indirect observational pieces of evidence have shown that
the magnetic field of CMEs reconnects with surrounding magnetic fields,
forming, e.g., dimming regions distant from the CME source regions. Analyzing
Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) observations of the eruption from AR 11226 on
2011 June 7, we present the first direct evidence of coronal magnetic
reconnection between the fields of two adjacent ARs during a CME. The
observations are presented jointly with a data-constrained numerical
simulation, demonstrating the formation/intensification of current sheets along
a hyperbolic flux tube (HFT) at the interface between the CME and the
neighbouring AR 11227. Reconnection resulted in the formation of new magnetic
connections between the erupting magnetic structure from AR 11226 and the
neighboring active region AR 11227 about 200 Mm from the eruption site. The
onset of reconnection first becomes apparent in the SDO/AIA images when
filament plasma, originally contained within the erupting flux rope, is
re-directed towards remote areas in AR 11227, tracing the change of large-scale
magnetic connectivity. The location of the coronal reconnection region becomes
bright and directly observable at SDO/AIA wavelengths, owing to the presence of
down-flowing cool, dense (10^{10} cm^{-3}) filament plasma in its vicinity. The
high-density plasma around the reconnection region is heated to coronal
temperatures, presumably by slow-mode shocks and Coulomb collisions. These
results provide the first direct observational evidence that CMEs reconnect
with surrounding magnetic structures, leading to a large-scale re-configuration
of the coronal magnetic field.

linear maps (s,t) such that b=t . a . s. We give an algorithm computing s and t
in time complexity O~(n^4) for all instances, and O~(n^3) in a dominant set of
instances.
  The IP2S problem was introduced in cryptography by Patarin back in 1996. The
special case of this problem when t is the identity is called the isomorphism
with one secret (IP1S) problem. Generic algebraic equation solvers (for example
using Gr\""obner bases) solve quite well random instances of the IP1S problem.
For the particular cyclic instances of IP1S, a cubic-time algorithm was later
given and explained in terms of pencils of quadratic forms over all finite
fields; in particular, the cyclic IP1S problem in odd characteristic reduces to
the computation of the square root of a matrix.
  We give here an algorithm solving all cases of the IP1S problem in odd
characteristic using two new tools, the Kronecker form for a singular quadratic
pencil, and the reduction of bilinear forms over a non-commutative algebra.
Finally, we show that the second secret in the IP2S problem may be recovered in
cubic time.

Since the effect of fast fading asymptotically disappears in massive MIMO
systems, large-scale fading becomes the most dominant factor for the ergodic
capacity of massive MIMO systems. Regarding this fact, in our work we
concentrate our attention on the effects of large-scale fading for massive MIMO
systems. Specifically, some interesting and novel lower bounds of the ergodic

importance sampling for drawing particles from a posterior distribution, and a
number of particle filters based on this principle have been proposed. Samples
are drawn from the prior and then moved according to some dynamics over an
interval of pseudo-time such that their final values are distributed according
to the desired posterior. In practice, implementing a particle flow sampler
requires multiple layers of approximation, with the result that the final
samples do not in general have the correct posterior distribution. In this
paper we consider using an approximate Gaussian flow for sampling with a class
of nonlinear Gaussian models. We use the particle flow within an importance
sampler, correcting for the discrepancy between the target and actual densities
with importance weights. We present a suitable numerical integration procedure
for use with this flow and an accompanying step-size control algorithm. In a
filtering context, we use the particle flow to sample from the optimal
importance density, rather than the filtering density itself, avoiding the need
to make analytical or numerical approximations of the predictive density.
Simulations using particle flow importance sampling within a particle filter
demonstrate significant improvement over standard approximations of the optimal
importance density, and the algorithm falls within the standard sequential
Monte Carlo framework.

promotes an effective low-rank estimation for the underlying data. However,
such max-norm regularized problems are typically formulated and solved in a
batch manner, which prevents it from processing big data due to possible memory
budget. In this paper, hence, we propose an online algorithm that is scalable
to large-scale setting. Particularly, we consider the matrix decomposition
problem as an example, although a simple variant of the algorithm and analysis
can be adapted to other important problems such as matrix completion. The
crucial technique in our implementation is to reformulating the max-norm to an
equivalent matrix factorization form, where the factors consist of a (possibly
overcomplete) basis component and a coefficients one. In this way, we may
maintain the basis component in the memory and optimize over it and the
coefficients for each sample alternatively. Since the memory footprint of the
basis component is independent of the sample size, our algorithm is appealing
when manipulating a large collection of samples. We prove that the sequence of
the solutions (i.e., the basis component) produced by our algorithm converges
to a stationary point of the expected loss function asymptotically. Numerical
study demonstrates encouraging results for the efficacy and robustness of our
algorithm compared to the widely used nuclear norm solvers.

approach. We obtain that the critical behavior of the model is controlled by
infinite-disorder fixed points different from that of the short-range one if
$0<a<1/2$. In this range, the critical exponents calculated analytically by a
simplified SDRG scheme are found to vary with $a$, while, for $a>1/2$, the

in the critical point but, as opposed to the short-range model, the prefactor
is disorder-dependent in the range $0<a<1/2$. Numerical results obtained by an

percent in the frequencies and damping times of dominant and sub-dominant modes

relatively rare, it is of interest to see how well the no-hair theorem can be
tested with events at much larger distances and with smaller signal-to-noise
ratios, thus accessing a far bigger volume of space and a larger number of
sources. We employ a model selection scheme called TIGER (Test Infrastructure

relativity with weak binary coalescence signals that will be seen in
second-generation detectors such as Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo. TIGER is
well-suited for the regime of low signal-to-noise ratio, and information from a
population of sources can be combined so as to arrive at a stronger test. By
performing a range of simulations using the expected noise power spectral

lattices of submillimetre-scale posts decorated with nano-textures can generate
a counter-intuitive bouncing regime: drops spread on impact and then leave the
surface in a flattened, pancake shape without retracting. This allows for a
four-fold reduction in contact time compared to conventional complete rebound.
We demonstrate that the pancake bouncing results from the rectification of
capillary energy stored in the penetrated liquid into upward motion adequate to
lift the drop. Moreover, the timescales for lateral drop spreading over the
surface and for vertical motion must be comparable. In particular, by designing
surfaces with tapered micro/nanotextures which behave as harmonic springs, the
timescales become independent of the impact velocity, allowing the occurrence
of pancake bouncing and rapid drop detachment over a wide range of impact
velocities.

\AA\ line profiles made with the Ultraviolet Coronagraph Spectrometer (UVCS) on

altitude of UVCS observations and the core transit time measured from UVCS data
made possible a firm identification of the CME core observed in white light and
UV with the prominence plasma expelled during the CME. Results on the 3D

can be reproduced within the uncertainties only in the peripheral part of the
CME front; at the front center, where the distance of the emitting plasma from
the plane of the sky is greater, synthetic widths turn out to be $\sim 25$%
lower than the measured ones. This provides strong evidence of line broadening

positrons. The system is coupled because of the collision term (an integral
operator). The model is intended especially for dose calculation (forward
problem) in radiation therapy. It, however, does not apply to all relevant
interactions in its present form. We show under physically relevant assumptions
that the system has a unique solution in appropriate ($L^1$-based) spaces and
that the solution is non-negative when the data (internal source and inflow
boundary source) is non-negative. In order to be self-contained as much as is
practically possible, many (basic) results and proofs have been reproduced in
the paper. Existence, uniqueness and non-negativity of solutions for the
related time-dependent coupled system are also proven. Moreover, we deal with
inverse radiation treatment planning problem (inverse problem) as an optimal
control problem both for external and internal therapy (in general
$L^p$-spaces). Especially, in the case $p=2$ variational equations for an
optimal control related to an appropriate differentiable convex object function
are verified. Its solution can be used as an initial point for an actual
(global) optimization.

of vertex-disjoint copies of $H$ which cover all the vertices in $G$. The
seminal Hajnal--Szemer\'edi theorem characterises the minimum degree that
ensures a graph $G$ contains a perfect $K_r$-packing. In this paper we prove
the following analogue for directed graphs: Suppose that $T$ is a tournament on
$r$ vertices and $G$ is a digraph of sufficiently large order $n$ where $r$
divides $n$. If $G$ has minimum in- and outdegree at least $ (1-1/r)n$ then $G$
contains a perfect $T$-packing. In the case when $T$ is a cyclic triangle, this
result verifies a recent conjecture of Czygrinow, Kierstead and Molla (for
large digraphs). Furthermore, in the case when $T$ is transitive we conjecture
that it suffices for every vertex in $G$ to have sufficiently large indegree or
outdegree. We prove this conjecture for transitive triangles and asymptotically
for all $r \geq 3$. Our approach makes use of a result of Keevash and Mycroft
concerning almost perfect matchings in hypergraphs as well as the Directed
Graph Removal lemma.

of D-dimensional geometries that admit a non-twisting and shear-free null

explicitly derive all Weyl scalars of various boost weights. This enables us to
give a complete algebraic classification of the metrics in the case when the
optically privileged null direction k is a (multiple) Weyl aligned null
direction (WAND). No field equations are applied, so that the results are valid
not only in Einstein's gravity, including its extension to higher dimensions,
but also in any metric gravitation theory that admits non-twisting and
shear-free spacetimes.
  We prove that all such geometries are of type I(b), or more special, and we
derive surprisingly simple necessary and sufficient conditions under which k is
a double, triple or quadruple WAND. All possible algebraically special types,
including the refinement to subtypes, are thus identified, namely II(a), II(b),
II(c), II(d), III(a), III(b), N, O, IIi, IIIi, D, D(a), D(b), D(c), D(d), and
their combinations. Some conditions are identically satisfied in four
dimensions.
  We discuss both important subclasses, namely the Kundt family of geometries
with the vanishing expansion (Theta=0) and the Robinson-Trautman family
(Theta\not=0, and in particular Theta=1/r). Finally, we apply Einstein's field
equations and obtain a classification of all Robinson-Trautman vacuum
spacetimes. This reveals fundamental algebraic differences in the D>4 and D=4
cases, namely that in higher dimensions there only exist such spacetimes of
types D(a)=D(abd), D(c)=D(bcd) and O.

the equation F(X;Y) = 0 has only finitely many solutions in integers (X;Y) with

Abouzaid gave a far-going generalization of Skolem theorem. He extended it in
two directions: first, he studied solutions not only in rational integers, but
in arbitrary algebraic numbers. Second, he not only bounded the solution in
terms of the logarithmic gcd, but obtained a sort of asymptotic relation
between the heights of the coordinates and their logarithmic gcd.
Unfortunately, Abouzaid assumption is slightly more restrictive than Skolem: he
assumes not only that the point (0;0) belongs to the plane curve F(X;Y) = 0,
but that (0;0) is a non-singular point on this curve. The purpose of the
present article is to get rid of this non singularity hypothesis.

potential of reservoir computing for ultrahigh bandwidth signal processing

to efficiently address the reservoir was performed digitally. Here we show how
this digital pre-processing can be replaced by an analog input layer. We study
both numerically and experimentally to what extent the pre-processing can be
replaced by a modulation of the input signal by either a single sine-wave or by
a sum of two sine functions, since harmonic oscillations are particularly easy
to generate in hardware. We find that the modulation by a single sine gives
performance worse than state of the art. On the other hand, on many -but not
all- tasks, the modulation by two sines gives performances comparable to the
state of the art. The present work thus represents an important step towards
fully autonomous, ultrahigh bandwidth analog reservoir computers.

LCDM concordance model of the Universe, which has been amplified by the
recently claimed discovery of non-zero tensor to scalar ratio $r$. At the same
time, the current best-fit value of $r$ suggests large field inflation delta
phi>M_p, which requires a UV complete description of inflation. A very
promising working example that predicts large tensor modes and can be UV
completed is axion monodromy inflation. This realization of inflation naturally
produces oscillating features, as consequence of a broken shift symmetry. We
analyse a combination of Planck, ACT, SPT, WMAP low l polarization and BICEP2
data, and show a long wavelength feature from a periodic potential can
alleviate the tension at low multipoles with an improvement delta chi^2 ~2.5-4
per degree of freedom, depending on the level of foreground subtraction. As
with an introduction of running, one expects that any scale dependence should
lead to a worsened fit at high multipoles. We show that the logarithmic nature
of the axion feature in combination with a tilt n_s~1 allows the fit to be
identical to a no feature model at the 2 percent level on scales 100 =< l
=<3500, and quite remarkable actually slightly improves the fit at scales l
>2000. We also consider possible unremoved dust foregrounds and show that
including these hardly changes the best-fit parameters. Our analysis suggests
an axion decay constant of f/M_p ~O(.01). We discuss how Planck measurements of
the TE and EE spectra can further constrain axion monodromy inflation with such
a large feature. A measurement of the large scale structure power spectrum is
even more promising, as the effect is much bigger since the tensor modes do not
affect the large scales. At the same time, a feature could also lead to a lower
sigma8, lifting the tension between CMB and SZ constraints on sigma8.

Adjusting the rf power alters the plasma conditions causing structural changes

SOLPS5.0 are presented. We focus on understanding main prospects associated
with the novel geometry of the Super-X divertor (SXD). This includes a
discussion of the effect of magnetic flux expansion and volumetric power losses
on the reduction of target power loads, the effect of divertor geometry on the
divertor closure and distribution of neutral species and radiation in the
divertor, the role of the connection length in broadening the target wetted
area. A comparison in conditions typical for MAST inter-ELM H-mode plasmas
confirms improved performance of the Super-X topology resulting in
significantly better divertor closure with respect to neutrals (the atomic flux
from the target increased by a factor of 6, but the atomic flux from the
divertor to the upper SOL reduced by a factor of 2), increased radiation volume
and increased total power loss (a factor of 2) and a reduction of target power
loads through both magnetic flux expansion and larger volumetric power loss in
the divertor (a factor of 5-10 in attached plasmas). The reduction of the
target power load by SXD further increases with collisionality (high density or
detached regimes) thanks to larger importance of volumetric power losses. It is
found that a cold divertor plasma leads to stronger parallel temperature
gradients in the SOL which drive more parallel heat flux, meaning that the
effectiveness of perpendicular transport in spreading the power at the target
can be reduced, and this needs to be taken into account in any optimisation.

a marginal spectral rise in optical region compared to the NIR region at

segregate into thinner and thicker domains composed predominantly of the
respective species. Using a coarse-grained mean-field model, we investigate how
mixing oil with the amphiphiles affects the structure and thickness of the
bilayer at and on either side of the boundary between two neighbouring domains.
In particular, we find that oil molecules whose chain length is close to that
of the shorter amphiphiles segregate to the thicker domain. This smooths the
surface of the hydrophobic bilayer core on this side of the boundary, reducing
its area and curvature and their associated free-energy penalties. The
smoothing effect is weaker for oil molecules that are shorter or longer than
this optimum value: short molecules spread evenly through the bilayer, while
long molecules swell the thicker domain, increasing the surface area and
curvature of the bilayer core in the interfacial region. Our results show that
adding an appropriate oil could make the formation of domain boundaries more or
less favourable, raising the possibility of controlling the domain size
distribution.

when the input is only slightly corrupted, the network tends to learn
fine-grained features. This motivates the scheduled denoising autoencoder,
which starts with a high level of noise that lowers as training progresses. We
find that the resulting representation yields a significant boost on a later
supervised task compared to the original input, or to a standard denoising

best model achieves the lowest ever reported error on the CIFAR-10 data set

homochirality. The result is optical activity of biological materials and
circular polarization in the light scattered by microorganisms, cells of living
organisms, as well as molecules (e.g. amino acids) of biological origin. Lab
measurements (Sparks et al. 2009a, b) have found that light scattered by
certain biological systems, in particular photosynthetic organisms, is not only
circular polarized but contains a characteristic spectral trend, showing a fast
change and reversal of sign for circular polarization within absorption bands.
Similar behavior can be expected for other biological and prebiological
organics, especially amino acids. We begin our study by reproducing the
laboratory measurements for photosynthetic organisms through modeling the
biological material as aggregated structures and using the Multiple Sphere
T-matrix (MSTM) code for light scattering calculations. We further study how
the spectral effect described above depends on the porosity of the aggregates
and the size and number of the constituent particles (monomers). We show that
larger aggregates are characterized by larger values of circular polarization
and discuss how light-scattering characteristics of individual monomers and
electromagnetic interaction between them affect this result. We find that
circular polarization typically peaks at medium (40-140{\deg}) scattering
angles, and discuss recommendations for efficient remote observation of
circular polarization from (pre)biological systems.

systems, are suitable laboratories to study star formation outside galaxies.
Recently, several such systems were observed, which contained many young star
forming regions outside the galaxies. In previous works, we have studied young
star forming regions outside galaxies in different systems with optical and/or
gaseous tidal debris, all of them with available archive GALEX/UV images, in
order to understand how often they occur and in which type of environments. In
this paper we searched for star forming regions around the galaxy NGC2865, a
shell galaxy which is circled by a ring of HI, with a total mass of 1.2 x
10$^9$ M$_\odot$. Using the Multi-Slit Imaging Spectroscopy Technique with the
Gemini telescope, we detected all H$\alpha$ emitting sources in the
surroundings of the galaxy NGC2865, down to a flux limit of 10$^{-18}$ erg
cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ \AA$^{-1}$. Together with Near and Far-Ultraviolet flux
information we characterize the star formation rates, masses, ages, and
metallicities for these HII regions. In total, we found 26 emission-line
sources in a 60 $\times$ 60 Kpc field centered over the southeastern tail of
the HI gas present around the galaxy NGC2865. Out of the 26 H$\alpha$ emitters,
19 are in the satellite galaxy FGCE 0745 and seven are intergalactic HII
regions scattered over the south tail of the HI gas around NGC2865. We found
that the intergalactic HII regions are young ($<$200 Myr) with stellar masses
in the range 4 X 10$^3$M$_\odot$ to 17x10$^6$ M$_\odot$. These are found in a
region of low HI gas density, where the probability of forming stars is
expected to be low. For one of the intergalactic HII regions we estimated a
solar oxygen abundance of 12 + log(O/H) $\sim$ 8.7. We also were able to
estimate the metallicity for the satellite galaxy FGCE0745 to be 12 + log(O/H)
~ 8.0.

the principle of Extreme Physical Information. EPI is derived as follows. The
observations follow an information flow J --> I, with J the information
intrinsic to the source and I the Fisher information level in its data, obeying
(i) I=4 Integral dx q' -squared. Here q'= dq/dx and p(x) = q(x)-squared is the
probability. It was previously shown, using L. Hardy's 5 axioms defining
physics, that I = max. Therefore, its variation (ii) delta I = 0. Note that I
is generic, obeying (i) for all source effects, whereas J is specific to the
particular effect. Hence, rather than having form (i), J obeys (iii) J =
Integral dx j[q(x),s(x)] with j some function of its arguments and s(x) a known
source, such as of mass, biological fitness, etc. Information I decreases under
any irreversible operation such as measurement, so that I l.e. J or,
equivalently, I = kJ where 0 l.e. k l.e. 1. Then the variation delta I = k
delta J so that property (ii) gives (iv) delta J = 0 as well. Then combining
(ii) and (iv), delta(I - J) = 0. Or, I - J = L = extremum. What kind of
extremum? Eqs. (i) and (iii) give (v) L=4q'^2 - j[q(x),s(x)]. Differentiating
(v), (d^2 L )/(dq'^2) = +8. Then by the Legendre condition the extremum is a
minimum. The unknown source effect obeys (vi) I - J= minimum, EPI.

small-world network which interpolates between regular lattice and random
network via rewiring, and investigate the effect of small-world connectivity on
emergence of noise-induced population synchronization in an inhibitory
population of subthreshold bursting Hindmarsh-Rose neurons. Thus, noise-induced
slow burst synchronization and fasg spike synchronization are found to appear
in a synchronized region of the $J-D$ plane. As the rewiring probability $p$ is
decreased from 1 (random network) to 0 (regular lattice), the region of spike
synchronization shrinks rapidly in the $J-D$ plane, while the region of the
burst synchronization decreases slowly. Population synchronization may be well
visualized in the raster plot of neural spikes which can be obtained in
experiments. Instantaneous population firing rate, $R(t)$, which is directly
obtained from the raster plot of spikes, is a realistic population quantity
exhibiting collective behaviors with both the slow bursting and the fast
spiking timescales. Through frequency filtering, we separate $R(t)$ into
$R_b(t)$ (describing the slow bursting behavior) and $R_s(t)$ (describing the
fast intraburst spiking behavior). Then, we develop thermodynamic order
parameters and statistical-mechanical measures, based on $R_b (t)$ and $R_s
(t)$, for characterization of the burst and spike synchronizations of the
bursting neurons and show their usefulness in explicit examples. With increase
in $p$, both the degrees of the burst and spike synchronizations are found to
increase because more long-range connections appear. However, they become
saturated for some maximal values of $p$ because long-range short-cuts which
appear up to the maximal values of $p$ play sufficient role to get maximal
degrees of the burst and spike synchronizations.
