separate the diffuse emission components of the inner Galaxy. The purpose of
the paper is to elucidate the morphology of the various emission components in
the strong star-formation region lying inside the solar radius and to clarify
the relationship between the various components. The region of the Galactic
plane covered is l=300-0-60deg where star-formation is highest and the emission
is strong enough to make meaningful component separation. The latitude widths
in this longitude range lie between 1deg and 2deg, which correspond to FWHM
z-widths of 100-200pc at a typical distance of 6kpc. The four emission
components studied here are synchrotron, free-free, anomalous microwave
emission (AME), and thermal (vibrational) dust emission. These components are
identified by constructing spectral energy distributions (SEDs) at positions
along the Galactic plane using the wide frequency coverage of Planck
(28.4-857GHz) in combination with low-frequency radio data at 0.408-2.3GHz plus
WMAP data at 23-94GHz, along with far-infrared (FIR) data from DIRBE and IRAS.
The free-free component is determined from radio recombination line (RRL) data.
AME is found to be comparable in brightness to the free-free emission on the
Galactic plane in the frequency range 20-40GHz with a width in latitude similar
to that of the thermal dust; it comprises 45+/-1% of the total 28.4GHz emission
in the longitude range l=300-0-60deg. The free-free component is the narrowest,
reflecting the fact that it is produced by current star-formation as traced by
the narrow distribution of OB stars. It is the dominant emission on the plane
between 60 and 100GHz. RRLs from this ionized gas are used to assess its
distance, leading to a free-free z-width of FWHM ~100pc...(abridged)

curved geometry of the liquid-vapour interface dictates that the local height
of the interface above the edge $\ell_E$ must remain finite at any subcritical
temperature, even when a macroscopically thick film is formed far from the
edge. Using an interfacial Hamiltonian theory and a more microscopic
fundamental measure density functional theory (DFT), we study the complete
wetting near a single edge and show that $\ell_E(0)-\ell_E(\delta\mu)\sim\delta
\mu^{\beta_E^{co}}$, as the chemical potential departure from the bulk
coexistence $\delta\mu=\mu_s(T)-\mu$ tends to zero. The exponent $\beta_E^{co}$
depends on the range of the molecular forces and in particular
$\beta_E^{co}=2/3$ for three-dimensional systems with van der Waals forces. We
further show that for a substrate model that is characterised by a finite

infinite substrate as $\delta\ell_E(L)\sim L^{-1}$ in the limit of large $L$.
Both predictions are supported by numerical solutions of the DFT.

programs statically. This work illuminates and poses solutions to theoretical
and practical challenges that stand in the way of combining the power of these
techniques. Pushdown flow analysis grants unbounded yet computable polyvariance
to the analysis of return-flow in higher-order programs. Abstract garbage
collection grants unbounded polyvariance to abstract addresses which become
unreachable between invocations of the abstract contexts in which they were
created. Pushdown analysis solves the problem of precisely analyzing recursion
in higher-order languages; abstract garbage collection is essential in solving
the ""stickiness"" problem. Alone, our benchmarks demonstrate that each method
can reduce analysis times and boost precision by orders of magnitude. We
combine these methods. The challenge in marrying these techniques is not
subtle: computing the reachable control states of a pushdown system relies on
limiting access during transition to the top of the stack; abstract garbage
collection, on the other hand, needs full access to the entire stack to compute
a root set, just as concrete collection does. Conditional pushdown systems were
developed for just such a conundrum, but existing methods are ill-suited for
the dynamic nature of garbage collection. We show fully precise and approximate
solutions to the feasible paths problem for pushdown garbage-collecting
control-flow analysis. Experiments reveal synergistic interplay between garbage
collection and pushdown techniques, and the fusion demonstrates

brightness level for the sky condition, which is a critical parameter for
judging a site for solar coronal observations. In this paper we present an
automatic method for the processing of SBM data in large quantity, which can
separate the regions of the Sun and the nearby sky as well as recognize the
regions of the supporting arms in the field of view. These processes are
implemented on the data acquired by more than one SBM instruments during our
site survey project in western China. An analysis applying the result from our
processes has been done for the assessment of the scattered-light levels by the
instrument. Those results are considerably significant for further
investigations and studies, notably to derive a series of the other important
atmospheric parameters such as extinctions, aerosol content and precipitable
water vapor content for candidate sites. Our processes also provide a possible
way for full-disk solar telescopes to track the Sun without an extra guiding
system.

submillimeter wavelengths is ubiquitous in infrared galaxies, both in the local

warm regions. In this work, models are presented that show that (i) the
highest-lying H2O lines (E_{upper}>400 K) are formed in very warm (T_{dust}>~90
K) regions and require high H2O columns (N_{H2O}>~3x10^{17} cm^{-2}), while
lower lying lines can be efficiently excited with T_{dust}~45-75 K and
N_{H2O}~(0.5-2)x10^{17} cm^{-2}; (ii) significant collisional excitation of the
lowest lying (E_{upper}<200 K) levels, which enhances the overall
L_{H2O}-L_{IR} ratios, is identified in sources where the ground-state para-H2O
1_{11}-0_{00} line is detected in emission; (iii) the H2O-to-infrared (8-1000
um) luminosity ratio is expected to decrease with increasing T_{dust} for all
lines with E_{upper}<~300 K, as has recently been reported in a sample of
LIRGs, but increases with T_{dust} for the highest lying H2O lines
(E_{upper}>400 K); (iv) we find theoretical upper limits for L_{H2O}/L_{IR} in
warm environments, owing to H2O line saturation; (v) individual models are
presented for two very different prototypical galaxies, the Seyfert 2 galaxy
NGC 1068 and the nearest ultraluminous infrared galaxy Arp 220, showing that
the excited submillimeter H2O emission is dominated by far-infrared pumping in
both cases; (vi) the L_{H2O}-L_{IR} correlation previously reported in
observational studies indicates depletion or exhaustion time scales,

spacetimes for which the metric is a solution to the Einstein field equations
in vacuum. While this formulation is sufficient to describe the motion of a
small object around a black hole, other applications require a more general
formulation that allows for a nonvacuum background spacetime. We provide a
foundation for such extensions, and carry out a concrete formulation of the
gravitational self-force in two specific cases. In the first we consider a
particle of mass $m$ and scalar charge $q$ moving in a background spacetime
that contains a background scalar field. In the second we consider a particle
of mass $m$ and electric charge $e$ moving in an electrovac spacetime. The
self-force incorporates all couplings between the gravitational perturbations
and those of the scalar or electromagnetic fields. It is expressed as a sum of
local terms involving tensors defined in the background spacetime and evaluated
at the current position of the particle, as well as tail integrals that depend
on the past history of the particle. Because such an expression is rarely a
useful starting point for an explicit evaluation of the self-force, we also
provide covariant expressions for the singular potentials, expressed as local
expansions near the world line; these can be involved in the construction of
effective extended sources for the regular potentials, or in the computation of
regularization parameters when the self-force is computed as a sum over
spherical-harmonic modes.

with a background electromagnetic field, extending previous studies to
situations in which gravitational and electromagnetic perturbations are
comparable. The formal expression $f^{ret}_\alpha$ for the self-force on a
particle, written in terms of the retarded perturbed fields, is divergent, and
a renormalization is needed to find the particle's acceleration at linear order
in its mass $m$ and charge $e$. We assume that, as in previous work in a Lorenz
gauge, the renormalization for accelerated motion comprises an angle average
and mass renormalization. Using the short distance expansion of the perturbed
electromagnetic and gravitational fields, we show that the renormalization is
equivalent to that obtained from a mode sum regularization in which one
subtracts from the expression for the self-force in terms of the retarded
fields a singular part field comprising only the leading and subleading terms
in the mode sum. The most striking part of our result, arising from a
remarkable cancellation, is that the renormalization involves no mixing of
electromagnetic and gravitational fields. In particular, the renormalized mass
is obtained by subtracting (1) the purely electromagnetic contribution from a
point charge moving along an accelerated trajectory and (2) the purely
gravitational contribution from a point mass moving along the same trajectory.
In a mode-sum regularization, the same cancellation implies that the required
regularization parameters are sums of their purely electromagnetic and
gravitational values.

linear dilaton black hole (RLDBH) spacetime describing an action, which emerges
in the Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton-Axion (EMDA) theory. RLDBH spacetime has a
non-asymptotically flat (NAF) geometry. When the rotation parameter "" $a$""
vanishes, the spacetime reduces to its static form, the so-called linear
dilaton black hole (LDBH) metric. Under scalar perturbations, we show that the
radial equation reduces to a hypergeometric differential equation. Using the
boundary conditions of the quasinormal modes (QNMs), we compute the associated
complex frequencies of the QNMs. In a particular case, QNMs are applied in the
rotational adiabatic invariant quantity, and we obtain the quantum entropy/area
spectra of the RLDBH. Both spectra are found to be discrete and equidistant,
and independent of $a-$parameter despite the modulation of QNMs by this
parameter.

with intervals of $\sim1$ week and net exposures of $\sim50$ ksec each. Among
the six observations, the source varied by nearly an order of magnitude, being
brightest in the 1st observation with a 2-10 keV luminosity of
$1.2\times10^{42}$~erg~s$^{-1}$, while faintest in the 4th with
$2.9\times10^{41}$~erg~s$^{-1}$. As it became fainter, the continuum in a 2-45
keV band became harder, while a narrow Fe-K$\alpha$ emission line, detected on
all occasions at 6.4 keV of the source rest frame, remained approximately
constant in the photon flux. Through a method of variability-assisted
broad-band spectroscopy (e.g., Noda et al. 2013), the 2-45 keV spectrum of NGC
3227 was decomposed into three distinct components. One is a relatively soft
power-law continuum with a photon index of $\sim 2.3$, weakly absorbed and
highly variable on time scales of $\sim5$ ksec; it was observed only when the
source was above a threshold luminosity of $\sim6.6 \times10^{41}$ erg s$^{-1}$
(in 2-10 keV), and was responsible for further source brightening beyond.
Another is a harder and more absorbed continuum with a photon index of $\sim
1.6$, which persisted through the six observations and varied slowly on time
scales of a few weeks by a factor of $\sim2$. This component, carrying a major
fraction of the broad-band emission when the source is below the threshold
luminosity, is considered as an additional primary emission. The last one is a
reflection component with the narrow iron line, produced at large distances
from the central black hole.

Our analysis demonstrates that not only entanglement but also quantum

rotor-routing to define a simply transitive action of the sandpile group of G
on its set of spanning trees. Their definition depends on two pieces of
auxiliary data: a choice of a ribbon graph structure on G, and a choice of a
root vertex. Chan, Church, and Grochow showed that if G is a planar ribbon
graph, it has a canonical rotor-routing action associated to it, i.e., the
rotor-routing action is actually independent of the choice of root vertex.
  It is well-known that the spanning trees of a planar graph G are in canonical
bijection with those of its planar dual G*, and furthermore that the sandpile
groups of G and G* are isomorphic. Thus, one can ask: are the two rotor-routing

basic conflict between nanometre separation desired for qubit-qubit
interactions, and the much larger scales that would enable control and
addressing in a manufacturable and fault tolerant architecture. Here we resolve
this conflict by establishing the feasibility of surface code quantum computing
using solid state spins, or `data qubits', that are widely separated from one
another. We employ a second set of `probe' spins which are mechanically
separate from the data qubits and move in-and-out of their proximity. The spin
dipole-dipole interactions give rise to phase shifts; measuring a probe's total
phase reveals the collective parity of the data qubits along the probe's path.
We introduce a protocol to balance the systematic errors due to the spins being
imperfectly located during device fabrication. Detailed simulations show that
the surface code's threshold then corresponds to misalignments that are
substantial on the scale of the array, indicating that it is very robust. We
conclude that this simple `orbital probe' architecture overcomes many of the
difficulties facing solid state quantum computing, while minimising the
complexity and offering qubit densities that are several orders of magnitude
greater than other systems.

LIRG IRAS F11506-3851, on the basis of VIMOS and SINFONI (ESO-VLT)
observations. The morphology and the 2D kinematics of the gaseous (neutral and
ionized) and stellar components have been mapped using the NaD doublet, the
H$\alpha$ line, and the near-IR CO(2-0) and CO(3-1) bands. The kinematics of
the ionized gas and the stars are dominated by rotation, with large observed
velocity amplitudes and centrally peaked velocity dispersion maps. The stars
lag behind the warm gas and represent a dynamically hotter system, as indicated
by the observed dynamical ratios. Thanks to these IFS data we have disentangled
the contribution of the stars and the ISM to the NaD feature, finding that it
is dominated by the absorption of neutral gas clouds in the ISM. The neutral
gas 2D kinematics shows a complex structure dominated by two components. On the
one hand, the thick slowly rotating disk lags significantly compared to the
ionized gas and the stars, with an irregular and off-center velocity dispersion
map. On the other hand, a kpc-scale neutral gas outflow is observed along the
semi-minor axis of the galaxy, as revealed by large blueshifted velocities
(30-154 km/s). We derive an outflowing mass rate in neutral gas of about 48
$\dot{M_{\rm w}}$/yr. Although this implies a global mass loading factor of
1.4, the 2D distribution of the ongoing SF suggests a much larger value of mass
loading factor associated with the inner regions (R$<$200 pc), where the
current SF represents only 3 percent of the total. All together these results
strongly suggest that we are witnessing (nuclear) quenching due to SF feedback
in IRAS F11506-3851. However, the relatively large mass of molecular gas
detected in the nuclear region via the H2 1-0 S(1) line suggests that further
episodes of SF may take place again.

level and their universality in effective field theories and string theory. We
argue that for gauge theories in the planar limit, loop-level soft gluon
theorems can be made manifest already at the integrand level. In particular, we
show that the planar integrand for N=4 SYM satisfies the tree-level soft
theorem to all orders in perturbation theory and provide strong evidence to
this effect for integrands in N<4 SYM. We consider soft theorems for
non-supersymmetric Yang-Mills theories and gravity, and show the validity of
integrand soft theorem, while loop corrections to the integrated soft theorems
are intimately tied to the presence of conformal anomalies. We then address the
question of universality of the soft theorems for various theories. In
effective field theories with F^3 and R^3 interactions, the soft theorems are
not modified. However for gravity theories with R^2 phi interactions, the
sub-sub-leading order soft graviton theorem, which is beyond what is implied by
the extended BMS symmetry, requires modifications at tree level for
non-supersymmetric theories, and at loop level for N<5 supergravity due to
anomalies. Finally, for superstring amplitudes at finite alpha', via explicit
calculation for lower-point examples as well as world-sheet OPE analysis for
arbitrary multiplicity, we show that the superstring amplitudes satisfy the
same soft theorem as its field-theory counterpart. This is no longer true for
bosonic closed strings due to the presence of R^2 phi interactions.

Intuitive techniques for improving the time-space complexity including adaptive

In several cases, where an early sample elimination might result in a false

proposed. The algorithm and heuristics are implemented and evaluated on various
publicly available datasets. Empirical evaluation shows up to 26x speed
improvement on some datasets against the sequential baseline, when evaluated on
multiple compute nodes, and an improvement in execution time up to 30-60\% is
readily observed on a number of other datasets against our parallel baseline.

massive perturbers a Monte Carlo simulation is conducted, using an impulsive
approximation method and assuming a galactic halo constituted by massive
particles of a characteristic mass. The results of such simulations are
compared with several subsamples of our improved catalog of candidate halo wide
binaries. In accordance with Quinn et al. (2009) we also find our results to be
very sensitive to the widest binaries. However, our larger sample, together
with the fact that we can obtain galactic orbits for 150 of our systems, allows
a more reliable estimate of the maximum MACHO mass than that obtained
previously. If we employ the entire sample of 211 candidate halo stars we
obtain an upper limit of $112 M_\sun$. However, using the 150 binaries in our
catalog with computed galactic orbits we are able to refine our fitting
criteria. Thus, for the 100 most halo-like binaries we obtain a maximum MACHO
mass of $21-68 M_\sun$. Furthermore, we can estimate the dynamical effects of
the galactic disk using binary samples that spend progressively shorter times
within the disk. By extrapolating the limits obtained for our most reliable
-albeit smallest- sample we find that as the time spent within the disk tends
to zero the upper bound of the MACHO mass tends to less than $5 M_\sun$. The
non-uniform density of the halo has also been taken into account, but the limit
obtained, less than $5 M_\sun$, does not differ much from the previous one.
Together with microlensing studies that provide lower limits on the MACHO mass,
our results essentially exclude the existence of such objects in the galactic
halo.

powerful technique to recover information about the early stages and evolution

the formation history from the nearby stellar remnants. We rely on the volume
complete sample of white dwarfs within 20 pc, where accurate cooling ages and
masses have been determined. The well characterized initial-final mass relation
is employed in order to recover the initial masses (1 < M/Msun < 8) and total
ages for the local degenerate sample. We correct for moderate biases that are
necessary to transform our results to a global stellar formation rate, which
can be compared to similar studies based on the properties of main-sequence
stars in the solar neighborhood. Our method provides precise formation rates
for all ages except in very recent times, and the results suggest an enhanced
formation rate for the solar neighborhood in the last 5 Gyr compared to the
range 5 < Age (Gyr) < 10. Furthermore, the observed total age of ~10 Gyr for
the oldest white dwarfs in the local sample is consistent with the early
seminal studies that have determined the age of the Galactic disk from stellar
remnants. The main shortcoming of our study is the small size of the local
white dwarf sample. However, the presented technique can be applied to larger
samples in the future.

F-theory compactifications that realize Grand Unified Theories (GUTs). In
F-theory, gauge symmetries with abelian gauge factors are modeled by singular
elliptic fibrations with additional rational sections, i.e. a non-trivial
Mordell-Weil rank. To determine the full scope of possible low energy theories
with abelian gauge factors, which allow for an F-theory realization, it is
central to obtain a comprehensive list of all singular elliptic fibrations with
extra sections. We answer this question for the case of one abelian factor by
applying Tate's algorithm to the elliptic fiber realized as a quartic in the
weighted projective space P^{(1,1,2)}, which guarantees, in addition to the
zero section, the existence of an additional rational section. The algorithm
gives rise to a tree-like enhancement structure, where each fiber is
characterized by a Kodaira fiber type, that governs the non-abelian gauge
factor, and the separation of the two sections. We determine Tate-like forms
for elliptic fibrations with one extra section for all Kodaira fiber types. In
addition to standard Tate forms that are determined by the vanishing order of
the coefficient sections in the quartic (so-called canonical models),the
algorithm also gives rise to fibrations that require non-trivial relations
among the coefficient sections. Such non-canonical models have
phenomenologically interesting properties, as they allow for a richer charged
matter content, and thus codimension two fiber structure, than the canonical
models that have been considered thus far in the literature. As an application
we determine the complete set of codimension one fibers types, matter spectra,
both canonical and non-canonical, for SU(5) x U(1) models.

between the tested system S and an apparatus A, so as to derive the properties
postulated in textbooks. We thus consider within standard quantum mechanics the
measurement of a quantum spin component $\hat s_z$ by an apparatus A, being a
magnet coupled to a bath. We first consider the evolution of the density
operator of S+A describing a large set of runs of the measurement process. The
approach describes the disappearance of the off-diagonal terms (""truncation"")
of the density matrix as a physical effect due to A, while the registration of
the outcome has classical features due to the large size of the pointer
variable, the magnetisation. A quantum ambiguity implies that the density
matrix at the final time can be decomposed on many bases, not only the one of
the measurement. This quantum oddity prevents to connect individual outcomes to
measurements, a difficulty known as the ""measurement problem"". It is shown that
it is circumvented by the apparatus as well, since the evolution in a small
time interval erases all decompositions, except the one on the measurement
basis. Once one can derive the outcome of individual events from quantum
theory, the so-called ""collapse of the wave function"" or the ""reduction of the
state"" appears as the result of a selection of runs among the original large
set. Hence nothing more than standard quantum mechanics is needed to explain
features of measurements. The employed statistical formulation is advocated for

bias results in determinations of the spatial morphology of Galactic bulge

pronounced among the more metal-rich stars than among the metal-poor stars. We
argue that this trend, a result recently claimed by three separate groups, may
have been overestimated as it is relatively easier to detect a bimodality in
the distance distribution function at higher metallicities. This is due to
three factors. First, the intrinsic colour of red clump and red giant stars
vary with metallicity, at the level d(V-I)_{RC}/d\[M/H] ~ 0.25 mag dex^{-1},
and thus the ratio of red clump to red giant stars within a spectroscopic
sample will depend on the photometric selection of any investigation. Second,
the duration of ascent of the red giant branch goes down and the red clump
lifetime goes up as metallicity increases, which has the effect of increasing
the ratio of red clump to red giant stars by as much as ~33% over the range of
the bulge metallicity-distribution function. Finally, over the same metallicity
interval, the effective number of red giant branch bump stars is predicted to
increase by ~200%, and their presence becomes degenerate with the observational
parameters of the two red clumps, creating an illusory increase in
signal-to-noise for a second peak in the distance modulus distribution.

recent software developments to explore the potential of three-dimensional (3D)
line ratio diagnostic diagrams. We introduce a specific set of 3D diagrams, the
ZQE diagrams, which separate the oxygen abundance and the ionisation parameter
of HII region-like spectra, and which also enable us to probe the excitation

is revealed by radio and X-ray observations of galaxy clusters and solar
flares, but the electron acceleration mechanism remains poorly understood.
Diffusive shock acceleration, also known as first-order Fermi acceleration,
cannot be directly invoked to explain the acceleration of electrons. Rather, an
additional mechanism is required to pre-accelerate the electrons from thermal
to supra-thermal energies, so they can then participate in the Fermi process.
In this work, we use two- and three-dimensional particle-in-cell plasma
simulations to study electron acceleration in low Mach number shocks. We focus
on the particle energy spectra and the acceleration mechanism in a reference
run with M=3 and a quasi-perpendicular pre-shock magnetic field. We find that
about 15 percent of the electrons can be efficiently accelerated, forming a
non-thermal power-law tail in the energy spectrum with a slope of p~2.4.
Initially, thermal electrons are energized at the shock front via shock drift
acceleration. The accelerated electrons are then reflected back upstream, where
their interaction with the incoming flow generates magnetic waves. In turn, the
waves scatter the electrons propagating upstream back toward the shock, for
further energization via shock drift acceleration. In summary, the
self-generated waves allow for repeated cycles of shock drift acceleration,
similarly to a sustained Fermi-like process. This mechanism offers a natural
solution to the conflict between the bright radio synchrotron emission observed
from the outskirts of galaxy clusters and the low electron acceleration
efficiency usually expected in low Mach number shocks.

small scatter this star-formation main sequence (SFMS) has been interpreted as
deterministic and fundamental. Here we demonstrate that it is a simple
consequence of the central limit theorem. Our derivation begins by
approximating in situ stellar mass growth as a stochastic process, much like a
random walk (where the expectation of SFR at any time is equal to the SFR at
the previous time). We then derive expectation values for median SSFR of
star-forming disks and their scatter over time. We generalize the results for
stochastic changes in SFR that are not independent of each other but are
correlated over time. For unbiased samples of (disk) galaxies, we derive an
expectation that <SSFR> should be independent of mass, decline as 1/T, and have
a relative scatter that is independent of mass and time. The derived SFMS and
its evolution matches published data to z=10 with sufficient accuracy to
constrain cosmological parameters. The framework reproduces several important
observables, including: the scatter in SSFR at fixed mass; the SFHs of nearby
dwarf galaxies and the Milky Way; and the scatter in the Tully-Fisher relation.
The evolution of the mass function is less well reproduced and we discuss ways
to generalize the framework to include other sources of stellar mass such as
mergers. The predicted dispersion in SSFR has consequences for the
classification of quiescent galaxies, as such galaxies have heterogeneous
formation histories, and many may only be temporarily diminished in their
star-formation activity. The implied dispersion in SFHs, and the SFMS's
insensitivity to timescales of stochasticity, thus substantially limits the
ability to connect massive galaxies to their progenitors over long cosmic
baselines. [TRUNC.]

breaking of scale invariance by almost marginal operators provides a
non-trivial inflaton minimum, which sets and stabilizes the final low-energy

slow-roll approximation remains valid over large inflaton displacements, and
yields a scale invariant spectrum of perturbations as required by the CMB

sufficiently ionized regions of protoplanetary disks, leading to mass
accretion. The dissipation of the potential energy associated with this
accretion determines the thermal structure of accreting regions. Until
recently, the heating from the turbulence has only been treated in an
azimuthally averaged sense, neglecting local fluctuations. However, magnetized
turbulence dissipates its energy intermittently in current sheet structures. We
study this intermittent energy dissipation using high resolution numerical
models including a treatment of radiative thermal diffusion in an optically
thick regime. Our models predict that these turbulent current sheets drive
order unity temperature variations even where the MRI is damped strongly by
Ohmic resistivity. This implies that the current sheet structures where energy
dissipation occurs must be well resolved to correctly capture the flow
structure in numerical models. Higher resolutions are required to resolve
energy dissipation than to resolve the magnetic field strength or accretion
stresses. The temperature variations are large enough to have major
consequences for mineral formation in disks, including melting chondrules,
remelting calcium-aluminum rich inclusions, and annealing silicates; and may
drive hysteresis: current sheets in MRI active regions could be significantly
more conductive than the remainder of the disk.

0.05<z<0.55 and quantified their impact on the cosmic shear signal. We combined
a sample of 38,104 galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts with high-quality data
from the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope. We used phase-space information to
select 14,576 cluster members, 14,250 of which have shape measurements and
measured three different types of alignment: the radial alignment of satellite
galaxies toward the brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs), the common orientations
of satellite galaxies and BCGs, and the radial alignments of satellites with
each other. Residual systematic effects are much smaller than the statistical
uncertainties. We detect no galaxy alignment of any kind out to at least 3
r200. The signal is consistent with zero for both blue and red galaxies, bright
and faint ones, and also for subsamples of clusters based on redshift,
dynamical mass, and dynamical state. These conclusions are unchanged if we
expand the sample with bright cluster members from the red sequence. We augment
our constraints with those from the literature to estimate the importance of
the intrinsic alignments of satellites compared to those of central galaxies,
for which the alignments are described by the linear alignment model.
Comparison of the alignment signals to the expected uncertainties of current

this will be the case for larger surveys.

spin ice. However, their effective energetics is made identical by the
contribution of an emergent field associated to the topological charge, thus
leading to a (quasi) ice manifold for lattices of even (odd) coordination. The
equivalence extends to the local low-energy dynamics of the ice manifold, where
the effect of geometric hard constraints can be subsumed into the spatial
modulation of the emergent field, which mediates an entropic interaction
between topological charges. There, as in spin ice materials, genuine ice
manifolds enter a Coulomb phase, whereas quasi-ice manifolds posses a well
defined screening length, provided by a plasma of embedded topological charges.
The equivalence between the two systems breaks down in lattices of mixed
coordination because of topological charge transfer between sub-latices. We
discuss extensions to social and economical networks.

Bruhat interval polytopes for G/P, which are moment map images of (closures of)

individuals' relocation decisions generate residential segregation in cities.
Agents belong to one of two groups and occupy cells of rectangular space.
Agents react to the fraction of agents of their own group within the
neighborhood around their cell. Agents stay put when this fraction is above a
given tolerance threshold but seek a new location if the fraction is below the
threshold. The model is well known for its tipping point behavior: an initial
random (integrated) pattern remains integrated when the tolerance threshold is
below 1/3 but becomes segregated when the tolerance threshold is above 1/3.
  In this paper, we demonstrate that the variety of the Schelling model steady
patterns is richer than the segregation-integration dichotomy and contains
patterns that consist of segregated patches for each of the two groups
alongside patches where both groups are spatially integrated. We obtain such
patterns by considering a general version of the model in which the mechanisms
of agents' interactions remain the same but the tolerance threshold varies
between agents of both groups.
  We show that the model produces patterns of mixed integration and segregation
when the tolerance threshold of most agents is either below the tipping point
or above 2/3. In these cases, the mixed patterns are relatively insensitive to
the model's parameters.

Camera and Spectrograph (MOIRCS) on the Subaru telescope. These protoclusters
are promising candidates for the most massive class of galaxy clusters seen
today (Paper I). The confirmed HAEs in the protoclusters at $z>2$ show high
excitation levels as characterized by much higher [OIII]/H$\beta$ or
[OIII]/H$\alpha$ line ratios than those of general galaxies at low-$z$. Such a
high excitation level may not only be driven by high specific star formation
rates (sSFRs) and lower gaseous metallicities, but also be contributed by some
other effects. We investigate the environmental dependence of gaseous
metallicities by comparing the HAEs in the protoclusters with those in the
general field at similar redshifts. We find that the gaseous metallicities of
protocluster galaxies are more chemically enriched than those of field galaxies
at a given stellar mass in the range of M$_\star\lesssim10^{11}$ M$_\odot$.
This can be attributed to many processes, such as intrinsic (or nature)
effects, external (or nurture) effects, and/or some systematic sampling
effects. We also find that the offset of the mass-metallicity relation in dense
environment becomes larger at higher redshifts. This can be naturally
understood by the fact that the in/out-flow rates in star forming galaxies are
much higher at higher redshifts. Therefore the environmental dependence of such
""feeding"" and ""feedback"" mechanisms in galaxy formation are probably playing
major roles in producing the offset of the mass-metallicity relation for the
protocluster galaxies at $z>2$.

proton-proton collisions remain an unresolved issue at the RHIC and LHC. A
substantial contribution to the hadronic final state from minimum-bias (MB)
jets is dominated by non-perturbative processes and may provide the common base
for any high-energy dijet. Observation of a same-side (on azimuth)""ridge"" in
LHC p-p collisions suggests to some that hydrodynamic flows may play a role in
that small system at higher energies. The issue of p-p centrality vs triggered
jets has emerged in the context of gluon transverse distributions in the proton
inferred from DIS data. Attempts have been made to isolate and study the
underlying event (UE) complementary to triggered dijets, and it is suggested
that multiple parton interactions may contribute to the UE.
  Reference [1] considered theoretical and experimental results for UE
systematics and p-p centrality in the context of a two-component (soft+hard)
model derived from single-particle $p_t$ spectrum $n_{ch}$ systematics. The
study concluded that there may be a substantial contribution to the UE from the
triggered dijet and that p-p centrality is not controlled significantly by a
jet trigger condition (if p-p centrality is relevant at all). Further study of
two-particle correlations in p-p collisions was called for, particularly the
$n_{ch}$ dependence of MB correlations.
  We report a comprehensive study of MB (no $p_t$ cuts) angular correlations
and trigger-associated (TA) $y_t$ correlations (transverse rapidity $y_t =
\ln[(m_t + p_t)/m_\pi])$ from 200 GeV p-p collisions. Angular correlations are
characterized by 2D model fits that accurately distinguish among proton
dissociation structure (soft), jet-related structure (hard) and a nonjet
azimuth quadrupole. All angular correlations are simply represented by a

real-analytic, or smooth. For the AFM and AFM* methods, we present an example

involves band-limited wave profiles of arbitrarily small amplitude, with
analytic Dirichlet data. We then show how to regularize the AFM and AFM*

the outcomes of low-speed collisions between planetesimals modeled as
gravitational aggregates. We use pkdgrav, a cosmology code adapted to
collisional problems and recently enhanced with a new soft-sphere collision
algorithm that includes more realistic contact forces. A rotating body has
lower effective surface gravity than a non-rotating one and therefore might
suffer more mass loss as the result of a collision. What is less well
understood, however, is whether rotation systematically increases mass loss on
average regardless of the impact trajectory. This has important implications
for the efficiency of planet formation via planetesimal growth, and also more
generally for the determination of the impact energy threshold for catastrophic
disruption (leading to the largest remnant retaining 50% of the original mass),
as this has generally only been evaluated for non-spinning bodies. We find that
for most collision scenarios, rotation lowers the threshold energy for
catastrophic dispersal. For head-on collisions, we develop a semi-analytic
description of the change in the threshold description as a function of the
target's pre-impact rotation rate, and find that these results are consistent
with the ""universal law"" of catastrophic disruption developed by Leinhardt &
Stewart. Using this approach, we introduce re-scaled catastrophic disruption
variables that take into account the interacting mass fraction of the target

address vibrational dynamics and propagation of stress waves in liquids. The
method is based on the decomposition of the macroscopic Green-Kubo stress
correlation function into the atomic level stress correlation functions. This
decomposition, as was demonstrated previously for a model liquid studied in
molecular dynamics simulations, reveals the presence of stress waves
propagating over large distances and a structure that resembles the pair
density function. In this paper, by performing the Fourier transforms of the
atomic level stress correlation functions, we elucidate how the lifetimes of
the stress waves and the ranges of their propagation depend on their frequency,
wavevector, and temperature. These results relate frequency and wavevector
dependence of the generalized viscosity to the character of propagation of the
shear stress waves. In particular, the results suggest that an increase in the
value of the frequency dependent viscosity at low frequencies with decrease of
temperature is related to the increase in the ranges of propagation of the
stress waves of the corresponding low frequencies. We found that the ranges of
propagation of the shear stress waves of frequencies less than half of the
Einstein frequency, extend well beyond the nearest neighbor shell even above
the melting temperature. The results also show that the crossover from
quasilocalized to propagating behavior occurs at frequencies usually associated
with the Boson peak.

centers to realize a factor of up to $\sqrt{N}$ improvement in sensitivity.
However, to realize fully this signal enhancement, new techniques are required
to excite efficiently and to collect fluorescence from large NV ensembles.
Here, we introduce a light-trapping diamond waveguide (LTDW) geometry that
enables both high fluorescence collection ($\sim20\%$) and efficient pump
absorption achieving an effective path length exceeding $1$ meter in a
millimeter-sized device. The LTDW enables in excess of $2\%$ conversion
efficiency of pump photons into optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR)
fluorescence, a \textit{three orders of magnitude} improvement over previous
single-pass geometries. This dramatic enhancement of ODMR signal enables
broadband measurements of magnetic field and temperature at less than $1$ Hz, a
frequency range inaccessible by dynamical decoupling techniques. We demonstrate

relativistic motion, but whose physical origin has remained murky. We focus on
a hot, magnetized jet that is emitted by a black hole and interacts with a
confining medium. Strongly relativistic expansion of the magnetic field, as
limited by a corrugation instability, may commence only after it forms a thin
shell. Then the observed $T_{90}$ burst duration is dominated by the curvature
delay, and null periods arise from angular inhomogeneities, not the duty cycle
of the engine. We associate the $O(1)$ s timescale observed in the pulse width
distribution of long GRBs with the collapse of the central 2.5-3$M_\odot$ of a
massive stellar core. A fraction of the baryons are shown to be embedded in the
magnetized outflow by the hyper-Eddington radiation flux; they strongly disturb
the magnetic field after the compactness drops below $\sim 4\times
10^3(Y_e/0.5)^{-1}$. The high-energy photons so created have a compressed pulse
structure. Delayed breakout of magnetic field from heavier baryon shells is
also a promising approach to X-ray flares. In the second part of the paper, we
calculate the imprint of an expanding, scattering photosphere on pulse
evolution. Two models for generating the high-energy spectral tail are
contrasted: i) pair breakdown due to reheating of an optically thin pair plasma
embedded in a thermal radiation field; and ii) continuous heating extending
from large to small scattering depth. The second model is strongly inconsistent
with the observed hard-to-soft evolution in GRB pulses. The first shows some
quantitative differences if the emission is purely spherical, but we show that
finite shell width, mild departures from spherical curvature, and latitudinal
Lorentz factor gradients have interesting effects.

feedback includes complex gain, for both the normal and for the tangential

to plasma rotation. The work includes (1) analysis with a reduced resistive MHD
model for a tokamak with finite \beta and with stepfunction current density and
pressure profiles, and (2) computations with full compressible visco-resistive
MHD and smooth decreasing profiles of current density and pressure. The
equilibria are stable for \beta=0 and the marginal stability values
$\beta_{rp,rw}<\beta_{rp,iw}<\beta_{ip,rw}<\beta_{ip,iw}$ (resistive plasma,
resistive wall; resistive plasma, ideal wall; ideal plasma, resistive wall;
ideal plasma, ideal wall) are computed for both cases. The main results are:
(a) imaginary gain with normal sensors or plasma rotation stabilizes below
$\beta_{rp,iw}$ because rotation supresses the diffusion of flux from the
plasma out through the wall and, more surprisingly, (b) rotation or imaginary
gain with normal sensors destabilizes above $\beta_{rp,iw}$ because it prevents
the feedback flux from entering the plasma through the resistive wall to form a
virtual wall. The effect of imaginary gain with tangential sensors is more
complicated but essentially destabilizes above and below $\beta_{rp,iw}$. A
method of using complex gain to optimize in the presence of rotation in the
$\beta>\beta_{rp,iw}$ regime is presented.

'objective reality', one might ask if a 'mechanical', conceptual model for
quantum mechanics could be found. We propose such a model. Vacuum energy
fluctuations imply mass fluctuations and, through general relativity, curvature
fluctuations. And those fluctuations are indicated by fluctuations of the
metric tensor. The metric tensor fluctuations can 'explain' the uncertainty
relations and non-commuting properties of conjugate variables. We argue that
that the probability density is proportional to the square root of minus the
determinant of the metric tensor (the differential volume element). We argue
that the metric elements are not stochastic but are oscillating at a high
enough frequency that measured values of same appear stochastic (i.e.
crypto-stochastic). We suggest that the oscillations at the position of
particles are described as torsional vibrations. A crypto-stochastic (or
chaotic) oscillating metric yields, among other things, a model of
super-position, photon polarization, and entanglement, and all within the
confines of a 4-dimensional space-time.

energy cosmic rays from Centaurus A to Earth, for particle rigidities from $E/Z
= 2$ EV to 100 EV, i.e., covering the possibility of primary particles as heavy
as Fe nuclei with energies exceeding 50 EeV. The Galactic magnetic field is
modeled using the recent work of Jansson and Farrar (JF12) which fitted its
parameters to match extragalactic Faraday rotation measures and WMAP7
synchrotron emission maps. We include the random component of the GMF using the
JF12 3D model for $B_{\rm rand}(\vec{r})$ and explore the impact of different
random realizations, coherence length and other features on cosmic ray
deflections. Gross aspects of the arrival direction distribution such as mean
deflection and the RMS dispersion depend mainly on rigidity and differ
relatively little from one realization to another. However different
realizations exhibit non-trivial substructure whose specific features vary
considerably from one realization to another, especially for lower rigidities.
At the lowest rigidity of 2 EV, the distribution is broad enough that it might
be compatible with a scenario in which Cen A is the principle source of all
UHECRs. No attempt is made here to formulate a robust test of this possibility,
although some challenges to such a scenario are noted.

positions of the Virgo satellites and the intermediate principal axis of the
local velocity shear projected onto the plane of the sky. Furthermore, the
dwarf satellites are found to appear more strongly aligned than the normal

normal and the dwarf satellites fall in the Virgo cluster preferentially along
the local filament and the local sheet, respectively. (ii) The local filament
is aligned with the minor principal axis of the local velocity shear while the
local sheet is in parallel to the plane spanned by the minor and the

We fix the problem of spurious exterior resonances via a combined field

scenarios rather than energy balance and efficient utilization. Thus mobile

stations extend cell coverage and enhance signal strength for mobile users.
However, busy traffic makes the relay stations in hot area run out of energy
quickly. In this paper, we propose an energy balancing strategy in which the
mobile nodes are able to dynamically select and hand over to the relay station
with the highest potential energy capacity to resume communication. Key to the
strategy is that each relay station merely maintains two parameters that
contains the trend of its previous energy consumption and then predicts its
future quantity of energy, which is defined as the relay station potential
energy capacity. Then each mobile node can select the relay station with the
highest potential energy capacity. Simulations demonstrate that our approach
significantly increase the aggregate throughput and the average life time of

consequence of our result is that the oscillations of the dynamics are

system under study contains multi bifurcation parameters and we do not know
\textit{a priori} how they come into play in the bifurcation dynamics. 2) the
representation of the linear operator on the center space is a $2\times 2$ zero
matrix, which makes the characteristic condition in the well-known normal form
theorem trivial. We overcome the first difficulty by using projection method.
We managed to overcome the second subtle difficulty by using a conjugate pair
coordinate for the center space and applying duality and projection arguments.
Due to the specific complex pair parametrization, we could naturally get a form
of the center manifold reduction function, which makes the study of the current
dynamics on the center manifold possible. The symmetry of the system plays an
essential role in excluding the possibility of bifurcating rotation waves.

three-dimensional (3D) invisibility for illumination near its center (i.e. with
a limited field of view), and its ideal wide-angle invisibility performance is

wave (SODW), proposed as a possible explanation to the `hidden order' phase of
URu2Si2. Due to the interplay between inter-orbital Coulomb interaction and
spin-orbit coupling (SOC) in this compound, the SODW is shown to arise from
Fermi surface nesting instability between two spin-orbit split bands. An
effective low-energy Hamiltonian including single-particle SOC and two-particle
SODW is derived, while numerical results are calculated by using
density-functional theory (DFT) based band structure input. Computed gapped
quasiparticle spectrum, entropy loss and spin-excitation spectrum are in
detailed agreement with experiments. Interestingly, despite the fact that SODW
governs dynamical spin-excitations, the static magnetic moment is calculated to
be zero, owing to the time-reversal invariance imposed by SOC. As a
consequence, SODW can be destroyed by finite magnetic field even at zero
temperature. Our estimation of the location of the quantum critical point is
close to the experimental value of Bc ~ 35 T. Finally, we extend the idea of
SODW to other SOC systems including iridium oxides (iridates) and
two-dimensional electronic systems such as BiAg2 surface and LaAlO3/SrTiO3
interface. We show hints of quasiparticle gapping, reduction of preexisting
magnetic moment, large magneto-resistance etc. in these systems which can be
explained consistently within the SODW theory.

zigzag direction can be greatly enhanced simultaneously at the critical strain
of 5% where the band convergence is achieved. The largest ZT value of 1.65 at
300 K is then achieved conservatively estimated by using the bulk lattice
thermal conductivity. When the armchair-direction strain of 8% is applied, the

the pure-pixel assumption is not always satisfied in an exact sense, especially
for scenarios where pixels are heavily mixed. In the no pure-pixel case, a good
blind HU approach to consider is the minimum volume enclosing simplex (MVES).
Empirical experience has suggested that MVES algorithms can perform well
without pure pixels, although it was not totally clear why this is true from a

an analysis framework wherein the perfect endmember identifiability of MVES is
studied under the noiseless case. We prove that MVES is indeed robust against

calculate the maximal transverse Lyapunov exponent to evaluate the asymptotic

failures and sector failures, both of which are prevalent in the field.
However, traditional erasure codes employ device-level redundancy to protect
against sector failures, and hence incur significant space overhead. Recent
sector-disk (SD) codes are available only for limited configurations. By making
a relaxed but practical assumption, we construct a general family of erasure
codes called \emph{STAIR codes}, which efficiently and provably tolerate both
device and sector failures without any restriction on the size of a storage
array and the numbers of tolerable device failures and sector failures. We
propose the \emph{upstairs encoding} and \emph{downstairs encoding} methods,
which provide complementary performance advantages for different
configurations. We conduct extensive experiments on STAIR codes in terms of
space saving, encoding/decoding speed, and update cost. We demonstrate that
STAIR codes not only improve space efficiency over traditional erasure codes,
but also provide better computational efficiency than SD codes based on our
special code construction. Finally, we present analytical models that
characterize the reliability of STAIR codes, and show that the support of a
wider range of configurations by STAIR codes is critical for tolerating sector
failure bursts discovered in the field.

projection algorithm (SPA), a simple, efficient and provably robust algorithm
in the pure-pixel algorithm class. Recently, a provably robust preconditioning
was proposed by Gillis and Vavasis (arXiv:1310.2273) which requires the
resolution of a semidefinite program (SDP) to find a data points-enclosing
minimum volume ellipsoid. Since solving the SDP in high precisions can be time
consuming, we generalize the robustness analysis to approximate solutions of
the SDP, that is, solutions whose objective function values are some
multiplicative factors away from the optimal value. It is shown that a high
accuracy solution is not crucial for robustness, which paves the way for faster
preconditionings (e.g., based on first-order optimization methods). This first
contribution also allows us to provide a robustness analysis for two other
preconditionings. The first one is pre-whitening, which can be interpreted as
an optimal solution of the same SDP with additional constraints. We analyze
robustness of pre-whitening which allows us to characterize situations in which
it performs competitively with the SDP-based preconditioning. The second one is
based on SPA itself and can be interpreted as an optimal solution of a
relaxation of the SDP. It is extremely fast while competing with the SDP-based
preconditioning on several synthetic data sets.

interference of tree-level and 1-loop diagrams. We compute the CP asymmetry in
flavor violating Higgs decays in an effective field theory with only one Higgs
boson and in a general Type-III Two Higgs Doublet Model (2HDM). We find that
large (~ O(10%)) asymmetries are possible in the 2HDM if one of the extra Higgs
bosons has a mass similar to the Standard Model Higgs. For the poorly
constrained decay modes h -> tau mu and h -> tau e, this implies that large
lepton charge asymmetries could be detectable at the LHC. We quantify this by
comparing the sensitivity of the LHC to existing direct and indirect
constraints. Interestingly, detection prospects are best if Higgs mixing is
relatively small - a situation that is preferred by the current data.
Nevertheless, CP violation in h -> tau mu or h -> tau e will only be observable

activities targeted at the camera from streaming videos, making the system to
predict intended activities of the interacting person and avoid harmful events
before they actually happen. We introduce the novel concept of 'onset' that
efficiently summarizes pre-activity observations, and design an approach to
consider event history in addition to ongoing video observation for early
first-person recognition of activities. We propose to represent onset using
cascade histograms of time series gradients, and we describe a novel
algorithmic setup to take advantage of onset for early recognition of
activities. The experimental results clearly illustrate that the proposed
concept of onset enables better/earlier recognition of human activities from
first-person videos.

In contrast, in the control sample we selected from the normal star forming

interaction rates may increase by ~5% for the starburst sample and 2% for the

uniform-disk diameter=1.076+/-0.093mas, R=960+/-92Rsun at 8.33+/-0.35kpc). We
detect a significant circumstellar contribution at K-band. The star and its
environment are variable in brightness and in size. The photospheric H-band
variations are well modelled with two periods: P0~470+/-10 days (amplitude
~0.64mag) and long secondary period LSP~2700-2850 days (~1.1mag). As measured
from CO equivalent width, <Teff>=3600+/-195K. The size, periods, luminosity
(<Mbol>=-8.44+/-0.22) and effective temperature are consistent with an M1
supergiant with an initial mass of 22.5+/-2.5Msun and an age of 6.5-10Myr
(depending on rotation). This age is in remarkable agreement with most

should be taken when using this star as an interferometric reference as it is

of view of finite extensions of the field $\mathbb{Q}$ of rationals. We point
out, as the main result, that the associated arithmetic structure of these
extensions makes natural an introduction of some Galois qubits. They are
two-dimensional subspaces of the Hilbert space of the model, which admit a
quantum informatic interpretation as elementary memory units for a
(hypothetical) computer, based on their distinctive properties with respect to
the action of related Galois group for indecomposable factors of the secular
determinant. These Galois qubits are nested on the lattice of subfields which
involves several minimal fields for determination of eigenstates (the complex
Heisenberg field), spectrum (the real Heisenberg field), and Fourier transforms
of magnetic configurations (the cyclotomic field, based on the simple 7th root
of unity). The structure of the corresponding lattice of Galois groups is
presented in terms of Kummer theory, and its physical interpretation is
indicated in terms of appropriate permutations of eigenstates, energies, and
density matrices.

complex web of coronal magnetic field structures. To understand this
complexity, the magnetic skeleton of the coronal field can be calculated. The
skeleton highlights the separatrix surfaces that divide the field into
topologically distinct regions, allowing open-field regions on the solar
surface to be located. Furthermore, separatrix surfaces and their intersections
(separators) are important likely energy release sites. This paper
investigates, throughout the solar cycle, the nature of coronal magnetic-field
topologies that arise under the potential-field source-surface approximation.
In particular, we characterise the typical global fields at solar maximum and
minimum. Global magnetic fields are extrapolated from observed Kitt Peak and
SOLIS synoptic magnetograms, from Carrington rotations 1645 to 2144, using the
potential-field source-surface model. Hence, variations in the coronal skeleton
are studied over three solar cycles. Key building blocks which make up magnetic
fields are identified and classified according to the nature of their
separatrix surfaces. The magnetic skeleton reveals that, at solar maximum, the
global coronal field involves a multitude of topological structures at all
latitudes. Many open-field regions exist originating anywhere on the
photosphere. At solar minimum, the coronal topology is heavily influenced by
the solar dipole. A strong dipole results in a simple large-scale structure
involving just two large polar open-field regions, but, at short radial
distances between plus or minus 60 deg latitude, the small-scale topology is
complex. If the solar dipole if weak, as in the recent minimum, then the
low-latitude quiet-sun magnetic fields may be globally significant enough to
create many disconnected open-field regions at low latitudes, in addition to
the two polar open-field regions.

zero electric charge, like gluons, but have a larger spin. Therefore we call
them tensor-gluons. The nonzero density of tensor-gluons can be generated by
the emission of tensor-gluons by gluons. Tensor-gluons can further split into
the pairs of tensor-gluons through a different channels. To describe all these
processes one should know the general splitting probabilities for
tensor-gluons. These probabilities should fulfill very general symmetry
relations, which we were able to resolve by introducing a splitting index. This
approach allows to find out the general form of the splitting functions, to
derive corresponding DGLAP evolution equations and to calculate the one-loop
Callan-Simanzik beta function for tensor-gluons of a given spin. Our results
provide a nontrivial consistency check of the theory and of the Callan-Simanzik
beta function calculations, because the theory has a unique coupling constant

vanishes leading to a conformal invariant theory at very high energies.

encoded in measurements of travel times between pairs of points on the solar
surface. Travel times are deduced from the cross-covariance of the random wave
field. Here we consider travel times and also products of travel times as
observables. They contain information about e.g. the statistical properties of
convection in the Sun. The basic assumption of the model is that noise is the
result of the stochastic excitation of solar waves, a random process which is
stationary and Gaussian. We generalize the existing noise model (Gizon and
Birch 2004) by dropping the assumption of horizontal spatial homogeneity. Using
a recurrence relation, we calculate the noise covariance matrices for the
moments of order 4, 6, and 8 of the observed wave field, for the moments of
order 2, 3 and 4 of the cross-covariance, and for the moments of order 2, 3 and
4 of the travel times. All noise covariance matrices depend only on the
expectation value of the cross-covariance of the observed wave field. For
products of travel times, the noise covariance matrix consists of three terms
proportional to $1/T$, $1/T^2$, and $1/T^3$, where $T$ is the duration of the
observations. For typical observation times of a few hours, the term
proportional to $1/T^2$ dominates and $Cov[\tau_1 \tau_2, \tau_3 \tau_4]
\approx Cov[\tau_1, \tau_3] Cov[\tau_2, \tau_4] + Cov[\tau_1, \tau_4]
Cov[\tau_2, \tau_3]$, where the $\tau_i$ are arbitrary travel times. This
result is confirmed for $p_1$ travel times by Monte Carlo simulations and
comparisons with SDO/HMI observations. General and accurate formulae have been
derived to model the noise covariance matrix of helioseismic travel times and
products of travel times. These results could easily be generalized to other
methods of local helioseismology, such as helioseismic holography and ring
diagram analysis.

and applied to some constraint satisfaction problems. In this model the input
is hidden by an oracle which, for a candidate assignment, reveals some
information about a violated constraint if the assignment is not satisfying. In
this paper we initiate a {\em systematic} study of constraint satisfaction
problems in the trial and error model. To achieve this, we first adopt a formal
framework for CSPs, and based on this framework we define several types of
revealing oracles. Our main contribution is to develop a \emph{transfer
theorem} for each type of the revealing oracle, under a broad class of
parameters. To any hidden CSP with a specific type of revealing oracle, the
transfer theorem associates another, potentially harder CSP in the normal
setting, such that their complexities are polynomial time equivalent. This in
principle transfers the study of a large class of hidden CSPs, possibly with a
promise on the instances, to the study of CSPs in the normal setting. We then
apply the transfer theorems to get polynomial-time algorithms or hardness
results for hidden CSPs, including satisfaction problems, monotone graph
properties, isomorphism problems, and the exact version of the Unique Games
problem. Most of the proofs of these results are short and straightforward,
which exhibits the power of the transfer theorems.

defined looking at the behaviour in time of the statistical operator, which
determines the evolution of mean values, the quantum regression theorem makes
statements about the behaviour of system correlation functions of order two and
higher. The comparison relies on an estimate of the validity of the quantum
regression hypothesis, which can be obtained exactly evaluating two points
correlation functions. To this aim we consider a qubit undergoing dephasing due
to interaction with a bosonic bath, comparing the exact evaluation of the
non-Markovianity measures with the violation of the quantum regression theorem
for a class of spectral densities. We further study a photonic dephasing model,
recently exploited for the experimental measurement of non-Markovianity. It
appears that while a non-Markovian dynamics according to either definition
brings with itself violation of the regression hypothesis, even Markovian
dynamics can lead to a failure of the regression relation.

always an aggregated state with remarkable structural rearrangements as we vary
the number of curcumin monomers from 4 to 16 monomers. We find that curcumin
monomers form clusters in a very definite pattern where they tend to aggregate
both in parallel and anti-parallel orientation of the phenyl rings, often seen
in the formation of beta-sheet in proteins. A considerable enhancement in the
population of parallel alignments is observed with increasing the system size
from 12 to 16 curcumin monomers. Due to the prevalence of such parallel
alignment for large system size, a more closely packed cluster is formed with
maximum number of hydrophobic contacts. We also follow the pathway of cluster
growth, in particular the transition from the initial segregated to the final
aggregated state. We find the existence of a metastable structural intermediate
involving a number of intermediate-sized clusters dispersed in the solution.
The course of aggregation bears similarity to nucleation and growth in highly
metastable state. The final aggregated form remains stable with total exclusion
of water from its sequestered hydrophobic core. We also investigate water
structure near the cluster surface along with their orientation. We find that
water molecules form a distorted tetrahedral geometry in the 1st solvation
layer of the cluster, interacting strongly with hydrophilic groups at the
surface of curcumin. The dynamics of such quasi-bound water molecules near the
surface of curcumin cluster is considerably slower than the bulk signifying a
restricted motion as often found in protein hydration layer.

energetic enough to play a role in heating the corona and accelerating the fast
solar wind. However, this result is based on comparisons to Monte Carlo
simulations and confirmation via direct measurements is still outstanding.
Thus, this letter reports on the first direct measurements of transverse wave
motions in solar polar plumes. Over a 4 hour period, we measure the transverse
displacements, periods and velocity amplitudes of 596 distinct oscillations
observed in the 171 \AA channel of SDO/AIA. We find a broad range of
non-uniformly distributed parameter values which are well described by
log-normal distributions with peaks at $234$ km, $121$ s and $8$ km s$^{-1}$,
and mean and standard deviations of $407\pm297$ km, $173\pm118$ s and $14\pm10$
km s$^{-1}$. Within standard deviations, our direct measurements are broadly
consistent with previous results. However, accounting for the whole of our
observed non-uniform parameter distribution we calculate an energy flux of
$9-24$ W m$^{-2}$, which is $4-10$ times below the energy requirement for solar
wind acceleration. Hence, our results indicate that transverse MHD waves as

underlying microscopic processes. In the stationary creep regime we have
determined the exponents of the shear rate dependence of the shear stress and
defect density, being $\alpha = 1.15 \pm 0.1$ and $\beta = 2.4 \pm 0.4$,

issue is to develop an effective scheduling algorithm for multiple services

investigate the downlink service scheduling problem in HSR network taking
account of end-to-end deadline constraints and successfully packet delivery
ratio requirements. Firstly, by exploiting the deterministic high-speed train
trajectory, we present a time-distance mapping in order to obtain the highly
dynamic link capacity effectively. Next, a novel service model is developed for
deadline constrained services with delivery ratio requirements, which enables
us to turn the delivery ratio requirement into a single queue stability
problem. Based on the Lyapunov drift, the optimal scheduling problem is
formulated and the corresponding scheduling service algorithm is proposed by
stochastic network optimization approach. Simulation results show that the
proposed algorithm outperforms the conventional schemes in terms of QoS
requirements.

constructing a similarity matrix from pairwise comparisons, using seriation
methods to reorder this matrix and construct a ranking. We first show that this
spectral seriation algorithm recovers the true ranking when all pairwise
comparisons are observed and consistent with a total order. We then show that
ranking reconstruction is still exact when some pairwise comparisons are
corrupted or missing, and that seriation based spectral ranking is more robust
to noise than classical scoring methods. Finally, we bound the ranking error
when only a random subset of the comparions are observed. An additional benefit
of the seriation formulation is that it allows us to solve semi-supervised

that seriation based spectral ranking achieves competitive and in some cases
superior performance compared to classical ranking methods.

the quenched fraction $f_{q}$ is strongly correlated with $\Sigma_{\rm 1kpc}$

increasing $M_{\rm h}$ shifts the entire sSFR distribtuion to lower sSFR

indicating only halo quenching. For satellite galaxies in the outskirts of
halos, quenching is a strong function of compactness and a weak function of
host $M_{\rm h}$. In the inner halo, $M_{\rm h}$ dominates quenching, with
$\sim 90\%$ of the satellites being quenched once $M_{\rm h} >
10^{13}M_{\odot}$. This regional effect is greatest for the least massive
satellites. As demonstrated via semi-analytic modelling with simple
prescriptions for quenching, the observed correlations can be explained if
quenching due to central compactness is rapid while quenching due to halo mass
is slow.

RKKY type interactions between localized moments \mu_{eff}, the substitution of
Ni by isoelectronic Pd leads the antiferromagnetic transition to decrease from
T_N~3.8K to ~1.2K between y=0 and 0.48, while M(H) measured at H=5Tesla and
1.8K rises from 0.12 up to 0.75\mu_B/Ce-at. Furthermore, the C_m(T_N) jump
increases with concentration whereas |\theta_P| decreases. The magnetic entropy
S_m(T) grows moderately with temperature for y=0 due to a significant
contribution of excited levels at low energy, while at y=0.5 it shows a
incipient plateau around S_m=Rln2. All these features reflect the progressive
ground state transformation of from itinerant to a local character. Another
peculiarity of this system is the nearly constant value of C_m(T_N) that ends
in an ""entropy bottleneck"" as T_N decreases. Consequently, the system shows a
critical point at y_{cr}~0.48 with signs of ferromagnetic behavior above
H_{cr}~0.3T. A splitting of the C_m(T_N) maximum, tuned by field and
concentration, indicates a competition between two magnetic phases, with

low-chromospheric, vector magnetogram of a quiet-Sun patch or an active region
and performs calculations in the absence of three-dimensional magnetic and
velocity-field information. In this work we strictly validate this method using
three-dimensional coronal magnetic fields. Benchmarking employs both synthetic,
three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic simulations and nonlinear force-free
field extrapolations of the active-region solar corona. We find that our
time-efficient NLFF method provides budgets that differ from those of more
demanding semi-analytical methods by a factor of ~3, at most. This difference
is expected from the physical concept and the construction of the method.
Temporal correlations show more discrepancies that, however, are soundly
improved for more complex, massive active regions, reaching correlation
coefficients of the order of, or exceeding, 0.9. In conclusion, we argue that
our NLFF method can be reliably used for a routine and fast calculation of free
magnetic energy and relative magnetic helicity budgets in targeted parts of the
solar magnetized corona. As explained here and in previous works, this is an
asset that can lead to valuable insight into the physics and the triggering of
solar eruptions.

the extend of the thick disc formation period by simulating several formation
episodes. We find that the vertical variation in density is not exponential,
but much closer to an hyperbolic secant squared. Assuming a single formation
epoch, the thick disc is better fitted with a sech2 scale height of 470 pc and
a scale length of 2.3 kpc. However if one simulates two successive formation
episodes, mimicking an extended formation period, the older episode has a
higher scale height and a larger scale length than the younger episode,
indicating a contraction during the collapse phase. The scale height decreases
from 800 pc to 340 pc, and the scale length from 3.2 kpc to 2 kpc. The star
formation increases from the old episode to the young one. During the fitting
process, the halo parameters are also determined. The constraint on the halo
shows that a transition between a inner and outer halo, if exists, cannot be at
a distance of less than about 30 kpc, which is the limit of our investigation
using turnoff halo stars. Finally, we show that extrapolating the thick disc
towards the bulge region explains well the stellar populations observed there,
that there is no longer need to invoke a classical bulge. To explain these
results, the most probable scenario for the thick disc is that it formed while
the Galaxy was gravitationally collapsing from well mixed gas-rich giant clumps
sustained by high turbulence which awhile prevent a thin disc to form, as
proposed by Bournaud et al. (2009). This scenario explains the observations in
the thick disc region as well as in the bulge region. (abridged)

conformational entropy of the chains which competes with the binding energy of
the cross-links. This competition gives rise to a sudden increase in the
fraction of bound sites as the tension increases. We show that this transition
is related to the cross-over between weak and strong localization of a directed
polymer in a pinning potential. The cross-over to the strongly bound state can
be interpreted as a mechanism for force-stiffening of cross-linked polymers --
beyond the elasticity of a single wormlike chain.

H-infinity control for a class of nonlinear spatially distributed processes
(SDPs) described by highly dissipative partial differential equations (PDEs),
whose state is observed by a sensor network (SN) with a given topology. A
highly dissipative PDE system typically involves a spatial differential
operator with eigenspectrum that can be partitioned into a finite-dimensional
slow one and an infinite-dimensional stable fast complement. Motivated by this
fact, the modal decomposition and singular perturbation techniques are
initially applied to the PDE system to derive a finite dimensional ordinary
differential equation model, which accurately captures the dynamics of the slow
modes of the PDE system. Subsequently, based on the slow system and the
topology of the SN, a set of finite dimensional distributed consensus observers
are constructed to estimate the state of the slow system. Then, a centralized
control scheme, which only uses the available estimates from a specified group
of SN nodes, is proposed for the PDE system. An H-infinity control design
method is developed in terms of bilinear matrix inequality (BMI), such that the
original closed-loop PDE system is exponentially stable and a prescribed level
of disturbance attenuation is satisfied for the slow system. Furthermore, a
suboptimal H-infinity controller is also provided to make the attenuation level
as small as possible, which can be obtained via a local optimization algorithm
that treats the BMI as double linear matrix inequality. Finally, the proposed
method is applied to the control of one dimensional Kuramoto-Sivashinsky
equation (KSE) system.

intergalactic medium in presence of massive neutrinos on scale ranging from a
few to hundreds of megaparsecs is required, if one wants to interpret
state-of-the-art data from observations of quasar spectra. To this end, we
provide a suite of hydrodynamical simulations made with Gagdet-3, spanning
different volumes and having a range of resolutions and neutrino masses (from
M_nu=0.1 to 0.8 eV, assuming 3 degenerate species), specifically designed to
meet the requirements of the Baryon Acoustic Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS). We
adopted a particle-type implementation of massive neutrinos, and chose
cosmological parameters compatible with the latest Planck (2013) results. While
the resolution requirements match the quality of the SDSS-III/BOSS data, our
numerical simulations will also establish a useful theoretical ground for
upcoming surveys such as SDSS-IV/eBOSS and DESI. In the very near future, data
from leading spectroscopic surveys will allow measuring the absolute mass scale
of neutrinos, and determining the exact nature of the neutrino mass hierarchy;

anharmonic terms in the potential energy when expanded about the equilibrium

quantum simulator made from trapped ions. To be concrete, we consider a linear
chain of $\text{Yb}^{171+}$ ions stabilized close to the zigzag transition. We
find that for typical experimental temperatures, frequencies change by no more
than a factor of $0.01\%$ due to the anharmonic couplings. Furthermore, shifts
in the effective spin-spin interactions (driven by a spin-dependent optical

center-of-mass frequency. However, detuning the spin interactions near other
frequencies can lead to nonnegligible anharmonic contributions to the effective
spin-spin interactions. We also examine an odd behavior exhibited by the
harmonic spin-spin interactions for a range of intermediate detunings, where
nearest neighbor spins with a larger spatial separation on the ion chain
interact more strongly than nearest neighbors with a smaller spatial
separation.

is illustrated, first for one and later for three neutrino generations, and
neutrinoless double beta decay is considered. Neutrino mixing and oscillations
in three flavors are described. The Yukawa couplings to the Higgs field of
quarks and leptons are considered, their transformation properties under the
corresponding flavor groups are spelled out and the principle of Minimal Flavor
Violation is illustrated, in connection with possible new physics beyond the
Standard Theory. The idea that the Yukawa couplings may be the vacuum
expectation value of some new fields is introduced and natural extrema of
potentials which are invariant under quark and lepton flavor groups are
characterized. A recent result indicating large mixing of almost degenerate
neutrinos is derived from the heavy lepton invariance under flavor ${\cal
O}(3)$.

experimental tool enabling accurate investigations of the dynamic phenomena in
molecular liquids. We introduced innovative experimental and fitting
procedures, that permit a safe deconvolution of sample response function from
the instrumental function. This is a critical issue in order to measure the
dynamics of sample presenting weak signal, e.g. liquid water. We report OKE
data on water measuring intermolecular vibrations and the structural relaxation
processes in an extended temperature range, inclusive of the supercooled
states. The unpreceded data quality makes possible a solid comparison with few
theoretical models; the multi-mode Brownian oscillator model, the Kubo's
discrete random jump model and the schematic mode-coupling model. All these
models produce reasonable good fits of the OKE data of stable liquid water,
i.e. over the freezing point. The features of water dynamics in the OKE data
becomes unambiguous only at lower temperatures, i.e. for water in the
metastable supercooled phase. Hence this data enable a valid comparison between
the model fits. We found that the schematic mode-coupling model provides the
more rigorous and complete model for water dynamics, even if is intrinsic
hydrodynamic approach hide the molecular information.

the system are presented. The detailed period analysis of photometry as well as
spectroscopy was carried out. In the system of AG Dra, two periods of
variability are detected. The longer one around 550 days is related to the
orbital motion, and the shorter one around 355 days is interpreted as
pulsations of the red giant in our older paper. In addition the active stages
change distinctively, but the outbursts are repeated with the periods from 359

  separately observable: Relational mass is observable while absolute mass is
  not","Posted to arXiv by Michael G. Raymer, Department of Physics,
  University of Oregon, on behalf of the estate of Craig R. Holt",,,,"physics.class-ph gr-qc","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A brief summary of the objections to the relational nature of inertial mass,
gravitational mass and electric charge is presented. The objections are refuted
by showing that the measurement process of comparing an instrument reference
clock and a reference rod both obeying the laws of physics to a system obeying
the same laws of physics results in relational quantities: inertial mass,
gravitational mass and electric charge appear only as ratios. This means that
scaling of the absolute inertial mass of every object in the universe by the
same factor is unobservable (likewise for gravitational mass and electric
charge). It is shown that the measurement process does not separate the
instrument parameters from the system parameters. Instead a measurement
produces functions of fundamental, dimensionless parameters such as the fine
structure constant, electron-proton mass ratio and the proton gyro-magnetic
factor. It is shown that the measurement of Planck's constant also results in
such a function of these dimensionless parameters. Application of this analysis
to the ""absolute"" Planck units shows that they too are functions only of
relational quantities. Analysis focuses initially on non-relativistic systems
for the sake of clarity and simplicity. The results are then extended to
relativistic systems described by the Dirac equation and the Einstein field
equations of general relativity. The results support the assertion that
instrument parameters cannot be separated from system parameters even in
classical mechanics.

trap is studied explicitly including the Bogoliubov approximation for
temperatures below the critical one. To model the evolution towards equilibrium
at each cooling step, we derive quantum kinetic equations that describe the
dynamics of the gas for temperatures above and below the transition
temperature. These equations, valid in the Born and Markov approximations,
consider the essential role of the chemical potential as the main parameter
that signals the transition. The kinetic equation that describes the growth of
the condensate below the transition temperature is derived within the
Bogoliubov approximation. To illustrate our results we propose an energetic
cooling protocol and simulate the whole sequence of the formation of a
condensate.

Electroencephalogram (EEG) and their detection is a challenging problem. Based
on the unique time-based parameters derived from wavelet coefficients and the
asymmetry property of wavelets a novel algorithm to separate ERP components in
single-trial EEG data is described. Though illustrated as a specific
application to N170 ERP detection, the algorithm is a generalized approach that
can be easily adapted to isolate different kinds of ERP components. The
algorithm detected the N170 ERP component with a high level of accuracy. We
demonstrate that the asymmetry method is more accurate than the matching
wavelet algorithm and t-CWT method by 48.67 and 8.03 percent respectively. This
paper provides an off-line demonstration of the algorithm and considers issues
related to the extension of the algorithm to real-time applications.
