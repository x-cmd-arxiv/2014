broken symmetry is often accompanied by new types of excitations. However, in
many magnetic pyrochlore oxides, geometrical frustration suppresses
conventional LRO while at the same time non-trivial spin correlations are
observed. For such materials, a natural question to ask then is what is the
nature of the excitations in this highly correlated state without broken
symmetry? Frequently the application of a symmetry breaking field can stabilize
excitations whose properties still reflect certain aspects of the anomalous
state without long-range order. Here we report evidence of novel magnetic
excitations in the quantum spin ice material Yb$_2$Ti$_2$O$_7$, obtained from
time-domain terahertz spectroscopy (TDTS). At large fields, both magnon and
two-magnon-like excitations are observed in a $<$001$>$ directed magnetic field
illustrating the stabilization of a field induced LRO state. The unique ability
of TDTS to measure complex response functions allows a direct study of magnetic
responses in different polarization channels, revealing the existence of an
unusual left-hand polarized magnon. The g-factors of these excitations are
dramatically enhanced in the low-field limit, showing a cross-over of these
one- and two-magnon states into features consistent with quantum string-like
excitations proposed to exist in quantum spin ice in a small $<$001$>$ applied
field.

on a microscopic model with $d$-density wave (DDW) scenario in the pseudogap

In particular, by computing and comparing energies of charge orders of
different modulation directions derived from a full microscopic theory with
$d$-density wave scenario, the axial charge order $\phi_{X(Y)}$ with wavevector
$\mathbf{Q}=(Q_0,0)((0,Q_0))$ is shown to be unambiguously energetically more
favorable over the diagonal charge order $\phi_{X\pm Y}$ with wavevector
$\mathbf{Q}=(Q_0,\pm Q_0)$ at least in commensurate limit, to be expected also
to hold even to more general incommensurate case, in agreement with experiment.
The two types of axial charge order $\phi_X$ and $\phi_Y$ are degenerate by
symmetry. We find that within the superconducting background, biaxial
(checkerboard) charge order is energetically more favorable than uniaxial
(stripe) charge order, and therefore checkerboard axial charge order should be
the one observed in experiments, assuming a single domain of charge ordered

frequency-conversion is drawing continued attention, and leading to emerging
applications such as supercontinuum sources for ultra stable clocks and

light confined in micro- and nanocavity resonances to enable on-chip operation.
Supposedly, nonlinear frequency conversion in such confined media differs from
traditional non-linear optics in three key features regarding output spectrum,
frequency shift, and critical time scale. Therefore, we switch GaAs-AlAs
microcavities by the electronic Kerr effect, and study a range of quality
factors to bridge the confined and the traditional non-linear regimes. We
uncover the key role of the density of vacuum fluctuations, i.e., the local
density of optical states (LDOS) for newly generated frequencies, a concept
inspired by cavity quantum electrodynamics (cQED). As a result, we succeed to
establish a framework, which not only describes nonlinear optics both in
traditional bulk and in confined media but also opens a new control dimension
in changing the color of light.

making possible efficient derivation of optimization algorithms directly in the

GHR calculus allows for the product and chain rule, and for a one-to-one

numerical applications are elaborated, and the results illuminate the
usefulness of the GHR calculus in greatly simplifying the derivation of the

generic forms as the corresponding real- and complex-valued algorithms, further
illustrating the advantages in algorithm design and evaluation.

the electric field and ribbon width. The latter forms the background of the

D slits with complex transmission are displayed on a spatial light modulator
(SLM). In a recent work we have shown a method that requires a single
phase-only SLM to control independently the complex coefficients which define
the quantum state of dimension D. The amplitude information was codified by
introducing phase gratings inside each slit and the phase value of the complex
transmission was added to the phase gratings. After a spatial filtering process
we obtained in the image plane the desired qudit state. Although this method
has proven to be a good alternative to compact the previously reported
architectures, it presents some features that could be improved. In this paper
we present an alternative scheme to codify the required phase values that
minimizes the effects of temporal phase fluctuations associated to the SLM
where the codification is carried on. In this scheme the amplitudes are set by
appropriate phase gratings addressed at the SLM while the relative phases are
obtained by a lateral displacement of these phase gratings. We show that this
method improves the quality of the prepared state and provides very high
fidelities of preparation for any state. An additional advantage of this scheme
is that a complete 2\pi modulation is obtained by shifting the grating by one
period, and hence the encoding is not limited by the phase modulation range
achieved by the SLM. Numerical simulations, that take into account the phase
fluctuations, show high fidelities for thousands of qubit states covering the
whole Bloch sphere surface. Similar analysis are performed for qudits with D =

equilibrium (with respect to the social cost) and of an optimal play. It has
been shown that the price of stability of any network design game is at most
$H_n$, the $n$-th harmonic number. This bound is tight for directed graphs. For
undirected graphs, the situation is dramatically different, and tight bounds
are not known. It has only recently been shown that the price of stability is
at most $H_n \left(1-\frac{1}{\Theta(n^4)} \right)$, while the worst-case known
example has price of stability around 2.25. In this paper we improve the upper
bound considerably by showing that the price of stability is at most $H_{n/2} +
\epsilon$ for any $\epsilon$ starting from some suitable $n \geq n(\epsilon)$.

eliminating the tension, we add a scalar dark matter to the aligned

with SM particles, which has no couplings to $WW$ and $ZZ$, but the independent
couplings to the up-type quarks, down-type quarks and charged leptons. We find
that the tension between $<\sigma v>_{SS\to b\bar{b}}$ and the constraint from
LUX induced by the scalar portal dark matter can go away for the
isospin-violating dark matter-nucleon coupling with $-1.0< f^n/f^p<0.7$, and

Interferometer Space Antenna} (eLISA) is expected to observe millions of
compact Galactic binaries that populate our Milky Way. GW measurements obtained
from the eLISA detector are in many cases complimentary to possible
electro-magnetic (EM) data. In our previous papers, we have shown that the EM
data can significantly enhance our knowledge of the astrophysically relevant GW
parameters of the Galactic binaries, such as the amplitude and inclination.
This is possible due to the presence of some strong correlations between GW
parameters that are measurable by both EM and GW observations, for example the
inclination and sky position. In this paper, we quantify the constraints in the
physical parameters of the white-dwarf binaries, i.e. the individual masses,
chirp mass and the distance to the source that can be obtained by combining the
full set of EM measurements such as the inclination, radial velocities,
distances and/or individual masses with the GW measurements. We find the
following $2-\sigma$ fractional uncertainties in the parameters of interest.
The EM observations of distance constrains the the chirp mass to $\sim 15-25
%$, whereas EM data of a single-lined spectroscopic binary constrains the
secondary mass and the distance with factors of 2 to $\sim 40 %$. The
single-line spectroscopic data complemented with distance constrains the
secondary mass to $\sim 25-30%$. Finally EM data on double-lined spectroscopic
binary constrains the distance to $\sim 30%$. All of these constraints depend
on the inclination and the signal strength of the binary systems. We also find
that the EM information on distance and/or the radial velocity are the most
useful in improving the estimate of the secondary mass,inclination and/or
distance.

surface is bending from the equator to the orbital plane of Saturn. The orbital
inclination of Iapetus to the local Laplace plane is ~8 deg, which is
unexpected, because the inclination should be ~0 if Iapetus formed from a
circumplanetary disk on the Laplace surface. It thus appears that some process
has pumped up Iapetus's inclination while leaving its eccentricity near zero
(e=0.03 at present). Here we examined the possibility that Iapetus's
inclination was excited during the early solar system instability when
encounters between Saturn and ice giants occurred. We found that the dynamical
effects of planetary encounters on Iapetus's orbit sensitively depend on the
distance of the few closest encounters. In four out of ten instability cases
studied here, the orbital perturbations were too large to be plausible. In one
case, Iapetus's orbit was practically unneffected. In the remaining five cases,
the perturbations of Iapetus's inclination were adequate to explain its present
value. In three of these cases, however, Iapetus's eccentricity was excited to
0.1-0.25, and it is not clear whether it could have been damped to its present
value (0.03) by some subsequent process (e.g., tides and dynamical friction
from captured irregular satellites do not seem to be strong enough). Our
results therefore imply that only 2 out of 10 instability cases (~20%) can
excite Iapetus's inclination to its present value (~30% of trials lead to >5
deg) while leaving its orbital eccentricity low.

Recently, this has become particularly strking in DFT (double field theory).
Two 'doubles' that are particularly relevant are double vector bundles and
Drinfel'd doubles. The original Drinfel'd double occurred in the contexts of
quantum groups and of Lie bialgebras. Quoting T. Voronov: ""Double Lie
algebroids arose in the works on double Lie groupoids and in connection with an
analog for Lie bialgebroids of the classical Drinfel'd double of Lie
bialgebras...Suppose $(A,A^*)$ is a Lie bialgebroid over a base $M$...
Mackenzie and Roytenberg suggested two different constructions based on the
cotangent bundles $T^*A$ and $T^*\Pi A$, respectively. Here $\Pi$ is the
fibre-wise parity reversal functor."" Although the approaches of Roytenberg and
of Mackenzie look very different, Voronov establishes their equivalence. We
have found Roytenberg's version to be quite congenial with our attempt to
interpret the gauge algebra of DFT in terms of Poisson brackets on a suitable
generalized Drinfel'd double. This double of a Lie bialgebroid $(A,A^*)$
provides a framework to describe the differentials of $A$ and $A^*$ on an equal
footing as Hamiltonian functions on an even symplectic supermanifold. A special
choice of momenta explicates the double coordinates of DFT and shows their
relation to the strong constraint determining the physical fields of double

$\ddot{f}$ can be measured using GW data only for the most massive WD binaries
observed at high-frequencies. Form timing the eclipses for $\sim 10$ years, we
find that $\dot{f}$ can be known to $\sim 0.1% $ for J0651. We find that from
GW data alone, measuring the effects of tides in binaries is (almost)
impossible. We also investigate the improvement in the knowledge of the binary

without $\dot{f}$. In our previous work we found that EM data on distance
constrained 2-$\sigma$ uncertainty in chirp mass to $15-25%$ whereas adding
$\dot{f}$ reduces it to $0.11%$. EM data on $\dot{f}$ also constrains
2-$\sigma$ uncertainty in distance to $35%-19%$. EM data on primary mass
constrains the secondary mass $m_2$ to factors of 2 to $\sim40%$ whereas adding
$\dot{f}$ reduces this to $25%$. And finally using single-line spectroscopic
constrains 2-$\sigma$ uncertainties in both the $m_2, d$ to factors of 2 to
$\sim 40%$. Adding EM data on $\dot{f}$ reduces these 2-$\sigma$ uncertainties
to $\leq 25%$ and $6%-19%$ respectively. Thus we find that EM measurements of

quarks at all temperatures for small magnetic fields and for temperatures close
to the transition temperature at zero magnetic field and above for strong

transition of the light sector smoother and shifted to larger temperatures. A

an inverse magnetic catalysis also in the s quark and smoothen the signature of

which was achieved by periodically driving infrared active apical oxygen

Langevin and Fokker-Planck description of driven, coupled Josephson junctions,
which represent two neighboring pairs of layers and their two plasmons. In a
toy model including only two junctions, we demonstrate that the external
driving leads to a suppression of phase fluctuations of the low-energy plasmon,
an effect which is amplified via the resonance of the high energy plasmon. When
extending the modeling to the full layers, we find that this reduction becomes
far more pronounced, with a striking suppression of the low-energy
fluctuations, as visible in the power spectrum. We also find that this effect
acts onto the in-plane fluctuations, which are reduced on long length scales.

Galton-Watson trees with offspring distribution B(n,d/n), i.e. the binomial
with parameters n and d/n, where d is fixed. Here we consider a broader version
of the problem, as we assume general offspring distribution, which includes
B(n,d/n) as a special case.
  Our approach relates the corresponding bounds for (non)reconstruction to
certain concentration properties of the offspring distribution. This allows to
derive reconstruction thresholds for a very wide family of offspring
distributions, which includes B(n,d/n). A very interesting corollary is that
for distributions with expected offspring d, we get reconstruction threshold
d/ln(d) under weaker concentration conditions than what we have in B(n,d/n).
  Furthermore, our reconstruction threshold for the random colorings of
Galton-Watson with offspring B(n,d/n), implies the reconstruction threshold for
the random colourings of G(n,d/n).

systems (e.g., phase noise (PN), high power amplifier (HPA) nonlinearities, or
in-phase/quadrature-phase (I/Q) imbalance) can severely degrade the performance
of traditional multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. Although
calibration algorithms can partially compensate these impairments, the
remaining distortion still has substantial impact. Despite this, most prior
works have not analyzed this type of distortion. In this paper, we investigate
the impact of residual transceiver hardware impairments on the MIMO system
performance. In particular, we consider a transceiver impairment model, which
has been experimentally validated, and derive analytical ergodic capacity
expressions for both exact and high signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). We
demonstrate that the capacity saturates in the high-SNR regime, thereby
creating a finite capacity ceiling. We also present a linear approximation for
the ergodic capacity in the low-SNR regime, and show that impairments have only
a second-order impact on the capacity. Furthermore, we analyze the effect of
transceiver impairments on large-scale MIMO systems; interestingly, we prove
that if one increases the number of antennas at one side only, the capacity
behaves similar to the finite-dimensional case. On the contrary, if the number
of antennas on both sides increases with a fixed ratio, the capacity ceiling
vanishes; thus, impairments cause only a bounded offset in the capacity
compared to the ideal transceiver hardware case.

formation itself. Despite their importance, we have not been able to fully
quantify the impact of jets and outflows during the formation of a star

resolve the magnetic jet-launching mechanism close to the protostar and at the

Current computer power and codes fall orders of magnitude short of achieving
this. In order to overcome this problem, we implement a subgrid-scale (SGS)
model for launching jets and outflows, which demonstrably converges and
reproduces the mass, linear and angular momentum transfer, and the speed of
real jets, with ~ 1000 times lower resolution than would be required without
SGS model. We apply the new SGS model to turbulent, magnetized star cluster
formation and show that jets and outflows (1) eject about 1/4 of their parent
molecular clump in high-speed jets, quickly reaching distances of more than a
parsec, (2) reduce the star formation rate by about a factor of two, and (3)
lead to the formation of ~ 1.5 times as many stars compared to the no-outflow

efficient experimental quantum field tomography. We employ our procedure to
capture ultracold atomic systems using atom chips, a setup that allows for the
quantum simulation of static and dynamical properties of interacting quantum
fields. Our procedure is based on cMPS, the continuous analogues of matrix

naturally incorporate the locality present in realistic physical settings and
are thus prime candidates for describing the physics of locally interacting
quantum fields. The reconstruction procedure is based on two- and four-point
correlation functions, from which we predict higher-order correlation
functions, thus validating our reconstruction for the experimental situation at
hand. We apply our procedure to quenched prethermalisation experiments for
quasi-condensates. In this setting, we can use the quality of our tomographic
reconstruction as a probe for the non-equilibrium nature of the involved
physical processes. We discuss the potential of such methods in the context of

relaxation in the tidal field of their host galaxy can acquire significant
internal differential rotation and are characterized by a distinctive radial
variation of the velocity anisotropy. These kinematical properties are the
result of the symmetry breaking introduced by the external tidal field in the
collapse phase and of the action of the Coriolis force on the orbit of the

differential rotation, with a peak located between one and two half-mass radii.
As for the anisotropy, similar to clusters evolving in isolation, the systems
explored in this Letter are characterized by an inner isotropic core, followed
by a region of increasing radial anisotropy. However for systems evolving in an
external tidal field the degree of radial anisotropy reaches a maximum in the
cluster intermediate regions and then progressively decreases, with the cluster
outermost regions being characterized by isotropy or a mild tangential
anisotropy. Young or old but less-relaxed dynamically young star clusters may

multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. Although compensation schemes
can cancel out part of these RF impairments, there still remains a certain
amount of impairments. These residual impairments have fundamental impact on
the MIMO system performance. However, most of the previous works have neglected
this factor. In this paper, a training-based MIMO system with residual transmit
RF impairments (RTRI) is considered. In particular, we derive a new channel
estimator for the proposed model, and find that RTRI can create an irreducible
estimation error floor. Moreover, we show that, in the presence of RTRI, the
optimal training sequence length can be larger than the number of transmit
antennas, especially in the low and high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regimes.
An increase in the proposed approximated achievable rate is also observed by
adopting the optimal training sequence length. When the training and data
symbol powers are required to be equal, we demonstrate that, at high SNRs,
systems with RTRI demand more training, whereas at low SNRs, such demands are
nearly the same for all practical levels of RTRI.

with dense targets are highly sensitive to the effect of laser ""noise"" (in the
form of pre-pulses) preceding the main ultra-intense pulse. These
system-dependent pre-pulses in the nanosecond and/or picosecond regimes are
often intense enough to modify the target significantly by ionizing and forming
a plasma layer in front of the target. Time resolved interferometry offers a
robust way to characterize the expanding plasma during this period. We have
developed a novel pump-probe interferometry system for an ultra-intense laser
experiment that uses two short-pulse amplifiers synchronized by one ultra-fast
seed oscillator to achieve 40-femtosecond time resolution over hundreds of
nanoseconds, using a variable delay line and other techniques. The first of
these amplifiers acts as the pump and delivers maximal energy to the
interaction region. The second amplifier is frequency shifted and then
frequency doubled to generate the femtosecond probe pulse. After passing
through the laser-target interaction region, the probe pulse is split and
recombined in a laterally sheared Michelson interferometer. Importantly, the
frequency shift in the probe allows strong plasma self-emission at the second
harmonic of the pump to be filtered out, allowing plasma expansion near the
critical surface and elsewhere to be clearly visible in the interferograms.
Three-phase reconstructions of the electron densities are then inferred by Abel
inversion. This interferometric system delivers precise measurements of
pre-plasma expansion that can identify the condition of the target at the
moment that the ultra-intense pulse arrives. Such measurements are
indispensable for correlating laser pre-pulse measurements with instantaneous
plasma profiles and for enabling realistic Particle-in-Cell simulations of the
ultra-intense laser-matter interaction.

value expected for spin down by magnetic dipole braking. We investigate
magnetic field evolution in the neutron star crust due to Hall drift as an
explanation for observed braking indices. Using numerical simulations and a
semi-analytic model, we show that a $\approx 10^{14}\ {\rm G}$ quadrupolar
toroidal field in the neutron star crust at birth leads to growth of the dipole
moment at a rate large enough to agree with measured braking indices. A key
factor is the density at which the crust yields to magnetic stresses that build
up during the evolution, which sets a characteristic minimum Hall timescale.
The observed braking indices of pulsars with inferred dipole fields of
$\lesssim 10^{13}\ {\rm G}$ can be explained in this picture, although with a
significant octupole component needed in some cases. For the stronger field
pulsars, those with $B_d\gtrsim 10^{13}\ {\rm G}$, we find that the magnetic
stresses in the crust exceed the maximum shear stress before the pulsar reaches
its current age, likely quenching the Hall effect. This may have implications
for the magnetar activity seen in the high magnetic field radio pulsar
PSR~J1846-0258. Observations of braking indices may therefore be a new piece of
evidence that neutron stars contain subsurface toroidal fields that are
significantly stronger than the dipole field, and may indicate that the Hall
effect is important in a wider range of neutron stars than previously thought.

problem. Many classification methods either ignore response-variable/covariate

cost, and the goal is to design a strategy (decision tree) for evaluating the
function incurring as little cost as possible in the worst case or in
expectation (according to a prior distribution on the possible variables
assignments). Except for particular cases of the problem, in general, only the
minimization of one of these two measures is addressed in the literature.
However, there are instances of the problem for which the minimization of one
measure leads to a strategy with a high cost with respect to the other measure
(even exponentially bigger than the optimal). We provide a new construction
which can guarantee a trade-off between the two criteria. More precisely, given
a decision tree guaranteeing expected cost $E$ and a decision tree guaranteeing
worst cost $W$ our method can guarantee for any chosen trade-off value $\rho$
to produce a decision tree whose worst cost is $(1 + \rho)W$ and whose expected
cost is $(1 + \frac{1}{\rho})E.$ These bounds are improved for the relevant
case of uniform testing costs. Motivated by applications, we also study a

running couplings high up in energy. Assuming that the SM is a low energy
effective theory of a cutoff theory residing at the Planck scale, we are able
to calculate the effective bare parameters of the underlying cutoff system. It
turns out that the effective bare mass term changes sign not far below the

symmetric phase. The sign-flip, which is a result of a conspiracy between the
SM couplings and their screening/antiscreening behavior, triggers the Higgs
mechanism. Above the Higgs phase transition the bare mass term in the Higgs
potential must have had a large positive value, enhanced by the quadratic
divergence of the bare Higgs mass. Likewise the quartically enhanced positive
vacuum energy density is present in the symmetric phase. The Higgs system thus
provides the large dark energy density in the early universe, which triggers
slow-roll inflation, i.e. the SM Higgs is the inflaton scalar field. Reheating

spin are investigated on the basis of a classical theory. We demonstrate that
the spin forces can alter the electron dynamics in an ultra-relativistic laser
field due to the coupling of the electron's spin degree of freedom to its
kinematic momentum. High-energy electrons can acquire significant
spin-dependent transverse momenta while passing through a counterpropagating
ultra-relativistic infrared laser pulse. Numerical calculations show that the
deflection of the electrons by the laser pulse is determined by the laser
intensity, the pulse duration, and the initial spin orientation of the
electron. We complement our investigation of these dynamical spin effects by
performing particle-in-cell simulations and point out possibilities of an
experimental realization of the predicted effect with available laser
parameters.

descent (BCD) method whereby at each iteration only one variable block is

desirable to parallelize the BCD method by allowing multiple blocks to be
updated simultaneously at each iteration of the algorithm. In this work, we
propose an inexact parallel BCD approach where at each iteration, a subset of
the variables is updated in parallel by minimizing convex approximations of the
original objective function. We investigate the convergence of this parallel
BCD method for both randomized and cyclic variable selection rules. We analyze
the asymptotic and non-asymptotic convergence behavior of the algorithm for
both convex and non-convex objective functions. The numerical experiments
suggest that for a special case of Lasso minimization problem, the cyclic block

successive minima of a parametric family of convex bodies attached to the given
point. Then they prove that the $n$-tuple of these successive minima can in
turn be approximated up to bounded difference by a function from a certain
class. In this paper, we show that the same is true within a smaller and
simpler class of functions which we call rigid systems. We also show that
conversely, given a rigid system, there exists a point in $\mathbb{R}^n$ whose
associated family of convex bodies has successive minima which approximate that
rigid system up to bounded difference. As a consequence, the problem of
describing the joint spectrum of a family of exponents of Diophantine
approximation is reduced to combinatorial analysis.

effects of anisotropy and tension-compression asymmetry both at single crystal
and polycrystal levels, it is possible to explain and accurately predict the
peculiarities of the room-temperature torsional response of a strongly textured
AZ31 Mg material. This is shown by using two modeling frameworks, namely: the
viscoplastic self-consistent (VPSC) polycrystal model that accounts for
tension-compression asymmetry of the mechanical response of a polycrystalline
aggregate due to the occurrence of twinning at single crystal level, and an
anisotropic plasticity model based on an orthotropic yield criterion that
accounts for tension-compression asymmetry in plastic flow at macroscopic
level, developed by Cazacu et al. (2006). It is shown that unlike Hill's
(1948), the latter macroscopic criterion quantitatively predicts the
experimental results, namely: that the sample with axial direction along the
rolling direction contracts, while the sample with axial direction along the
normal direction elongates. Moreover, it is demonstrated that these
experimentally observed axial effects in torsion can be also quantitatively
predicted with the VPSC polycrystal model only if both slip and twinning are
considered active at single crystal level. On the other hand, if it is assumed
that the plastic deformation is fully accommodated by crystallographic slip,
the predicted axial strains are very close with that obtained with Hill (1948)
criterion, which largely underestimate the measured axial strains.

harvesting networks where fairness is required among both the nodes and the
time slots. Unlike most previous work on fairness, we focus on multihop
topologies and consider different routing methods. We assume a predictable
energy profile and focus on the design of efficient and optimal algorithms that
can serve as benchmarks for distributed and approximate algorithms. We first
develop an algorithm that obtains a max-min fair rate assignment for any given
(time-variable or time-invariable) unsplittable routing or a routing tree. For
time-invariable unsplittable routing, we also develop an algorithm that finds
routes that maximize the minimum rate assigned to any node in any slot. For
fractional routing, we study the joint routing and rate assignment problem. We
develop an algorithm for the time-invariable case with constant rates. We show
that the time-variable case is at least as hard as the 2-commodity feasible
flow problem and design an FPTAS to combat the high running time. Finally, we
show that finding an unsplittable routing or a routing tree that provides
lexicographically maximum rate assignment (i.e., that is the best in the
max-min fairness terms) is NP-hard, even for a time horizon of a single slot.
Our analysis provides insights into the problem structure and can be applied to
other related fairness problems.

polynomial over a finite field under the assumption of the Extended Riemann
Hypothesis (ERH). This work builds upon the line of approach first explored by
Gao in $2001$. The general approach has been to implicitly construct a graph
with the roots as vertices and the edges formed by some polynomial time
computable relation. The algorithm then fails to factor a polynomial if this
associated graph turns out to be \emph{regular}. In the first part of our work
we strengthen the edge relation so that the resulting set of graphs we obtain
are subgraphs of Gao's graphs, all of which must be \emph{regular}.
  In the second part of our work we strengthen the regularity condition of
these graphs. This is accomplished by finding a parallel between their
algorithms and the $1$-dimensional Weisfeiler-Leman algorithm for solving the
Graph Isomorphism problem. We observe that the general principle behind their
algorithms is to separate the roots by computing the $1$-dimensional
Weisfeiler-Leman approximation to the orbits of this graph. This leads us to
the natural question of whether this approximation may be improved. We then go
on to show how to implicitly compute the $2$-dimensional Weisfeiler-Leman
approximation of the orbits of these graphs. The polynomials that our algorithm
fails to factor form graphs that are \emph{strongly regular} and their set of
adjacency matrices forms a combinatorial structure called an \emph{Association
scheme}.

believe that they are communicating with a trusted entity which compels them to
share their personal, financial information. Phishing costs Internet users
billions of dollars every year. Researchers at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU)
created an anti-phishing landing page supported by Anti-Phishing Working Group
(APWG) with the aim to train users on how to prevent themselves from phishing
attacks. It is used by financial institutions, phish site take down vendors,
government organizations, and online merchants. When a potential victim clicks
on a phishing link that has been taken down, he / she is redirected to the
landing page. In this paper, we present the comparative analysis on two
datasets that we obtained from APWG's landing page log files; one, from
September 7, 2008 - November 11, 2009, and other from January 1, 2014 - April
30, 2014. We found that the landing page has been successful in training users
against phishing. Forty six percent users clicked lesser number of phishing
URLs from January 2014 to April 2014 which shows that training from the landing
page helped users not to fall for phishing attacks. Our analysis shows that
phishers have started to modify their techniques by creating more legitimate
looking URLs and buying large number of domains to increase their activity. We
observed that phishers are exploiting ICANN accredited registrars to launch
their attacks even after strict surveillance. We saw that phishers are trying
to exploit free subdomain registration services to carry out attacks. In this
paper, we also compared the phishing e-mails used by phishers to lure victims
in 2008 and 2014. We found that the phishing e-mails have changed considerably
over time. Phishers have adopted new techniques like sending promotional
e-mails and emotionally targeting users in clicking phishing URLs.

massive e-crime. To counter the dissemination of long complex URLs in emails
and character limit imposed on various OSM (like Twitter), the concept of URL
shortening has gained a lot of traction. URL shorteners take as input a long
URL and output a short URL with the same landing page (as in the long URL) in
return. With their immense popularity over time, URL shorteners have become a
prime target for the attackers giving them an advantage to conceal malicious
content. Bitly, a leading service among all shortening services is being
exploited heavily to carry out phishing attacks, work-from-home scams,
pornographic content propagation, etc. This imposes additional performance
pressure on Bitly and other URL shorteners to be able to detect and take a
timely action against the illegitimate content. In this study, we analyzed a
dataset of 763,160 short URLs marked suspicious by Bitly in the month of
October 2013. Our results reveal that Bitly is not using its claimed spam
detection services very effectively. We also show how a suspicious Bitly
account goes unnoticed despite of a prolonged recurrent illegitimate activity.
Bitly displays a warning page on identification of suspicious links, but we
observed this approach to be weak in controlling the overall propagation of
spam. We also identified some short URL based features and coupled them with
two domain specific features to classify a Bitly URL as malicious or benign and
achieved an accuracy of 86.41%. The feature set identified can be generalized
to other URL shortening services as well. To the best of our knowledge, this is
the first large scale study to highlight the issues with the implementation of
Bitly's spam detection policies and proposing suitable countermeasures.

$G$ contains a complete bipartite subgraph $K_{k,k}$. This is the most easily
stated problem on graphs whose parameterized complexity is still unknown. We
provide an fpt-reduction from $k$-clique to $k$-biclique, thus solving this
longstanding open problem.
  Our reduction use a class of bipartite graphs with a threshold property of
independent interest. More specifically, for positive integers $n$, $s$ and
$t$, we consider a bipartite graph $G=(A\;\dot\cup\;B, E)$ such that $A$ can be
partitioned into $A=V_1\;\dot\cup \;V_2\;\dot\cup\cdots\dot\cup\; V_n$ and for
every $s$ distinct indices $i_1\cdots i_s$, there exist $v_{i_1}\in
V_{i_1}\cdots v_{i_s}\in V_{i_s}$ such that $v_{i_1}\cdots v_{i_s}$ have at
least $t+1$ common neighbors in $B$; on the other hand, every $s+1$ distinct
vertices in $A$ have at most $t$ common neighbors in $B$.
  Using the Paley-type graphs and Weil's character sum theorem, we show that
for $t=(s+1)!$ and $n$ large enough, such threshold bipartite graphs can be
computed in $n^{O(1)}$. One corollary of our reduction is that there is no
$f(k)\cdot n^{o(k)}$ time algorithm to decide whether a graph contains a
subgraph isomorphic to $K_{k!,k!}$ unless the ETH(Exponential Time Hypothesis)
fails. We also provide a probabilistic construction with better parameters
$t=\Theta(s^2)$, which indicates that $k$-biclique has no $f(k)\cdot
n^{o(\sqrt{k})}$-time algorithm unless 3-SAT with $m$ clauses can be solved in
$2^{o(m)}$-time with high probability. Our result also implies the dichotomy
classification of the parameterized complexity of cardinality constrain
satisfaction problem and the inapproximability of maximum $k$-intersection
problem.

DiPerna-Lions theory. More precisely, we prove existence and uniqueness of a
maximal regular flow for the DiPerna-Lions theory using only local regularity
and summability assumptions on the vector field, in analogy with the classical
theory, which uses only local regularity assumptions. We also study the
behaviour of the ODE trajectories before the maximal existence time. Unlike the
Cauchy-Lipschitz theory, this behaviour crucially depends on the nature of the
bounds imposed on the spatial divergence of the vector field. In particular, a
global assumption on the divergence is needed to obtain a proper blow-up of the
trajectories.

wide interest in statistics lately and a lot of methods to simultaneously
perform clustering and dimension reduction have been proposed. This work
presents a novel procedure for simultaneously determining the optimal cluster
structure for multivariate binary data and the subspace to represent that
cluster structure. The method is based on a finite mixture model of
multivariate Bernoulli distributions, and each component is assumed to have a
low-dimensional representation of the cluster structure. This method can be
considered an extension of the traditional latent class analysis model.
Sparsity is introduced to the loading values, which produces the
low-dimensional subspace, for enhanced interpretability and more stable
extraction of the subspace. An EM-based algorithm is developed to efficiently
solve the proposed optimization problem. We demonstrate the effectiveness of
the proposed method by applying it to a simulation study and real datasets.

of the stationary configuration. Various authors in the past several decades
demonstrated the validity of such an assumption for inviscid hydrodynamic flow.
Inviscid assumption is a reasonable approximation for low angular^M momentum
advection dominated flow in connection to certain^M supermassive black holes at
the^M centres of the galaxies (including our own) fed from a number of stellar
donors.^M Introduction of a weak viscosity, however, may sometimes provide a
more detail understanding of the observed spectrum. Recently it has been
demonstrated that introduction of small amount of viscosity in the form of
quasi-viscous flow makes a stationary accretion disc -- where the geometric
configuration of matter is described by axisymmetric flow in hydrostatic
equilibrium -- unstable. We perform similar analysis for other disc models (for
all three possible geometric configurations of matter) for quasi-viscous models
under the post-Newtonian scheme. We introduced perturbations on the stationary
flow solution particularly in standing wave form and studied their time
evolution to observe whether they grow with time. Our analysis shows that same
sort of secular instability exists in other disc models too. We further argued
that with sufficiently low value of viscosity in the realistic astrophysical
perspective, the instability does not effectively jeopardize the stationary
condition.

$>30$~mCrab near peak luminosity in the 2008 and 2011 outbursts of the
accreting millisecond X-ray pulsar SAX J1808.4--3658 in observations with the
\textit{Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer}. In each of the two outbursts this high
luminosity flaring is seen for $\sim$3 continuous days and switches on and off
on a timescale of 1--2~hr.
  The flaring can be seen directly in the light curve, where it shows sharp
spikes of emission at quasi-regular separation. In the power spectrum it
produces a broad noise component, which peaks at 1--5~Hz. The total 0.05--10~Hz
variability has a fractional rms amplitude of 20\%--45\%, well in excess of the
8\%--12\% rms broad-band noise usually seen in power spectra of SAX
J1808.4--3658.
  We perform a detailed timing analysis of the flaring and study its relation
to the 401~Hz pulsations. We find that the pulse amplitude varies
proportionally with source flux through all phases of the flaring, indicating
that the flaring is likely due to mass density variations created at or outside
the magnetospheric boundary. We suggest that this 1--5~Hz flaring is a high
mass accretion rate version of the 0.5--2~Hz flaring which is known to occur at
low luminosity ($<13$~mCrab), late in the tail of outbursts of SAX
J1808.4--3658. We propose the dead-disk instability, previously suggested as
the mechanism for the 0.5--2~Hz flaring, as a likely mechanism for the high
luminosity flaring reported here.

the dispersal of gas from the cluster galaxies by tidal interactions, galactic
winds, and ram pressure stripping on the other hand. A reasonably complete

semi-analytic modeling that can be easily implemented to explore a wide range
of parameters. We present first results from a simple model that describes the
build up of the gas mass fraction in clusters by following the overall impact
of the above processes during the merger and accretion history of each cluster

constant rotation curves. The mass density in the equatorial plane falls like
(distance)$^{-1}$ at large radii. Although the inner equidensity contours may
be spherical, oblate or prolate, the outer parts are always severely flattened.
The elongated shape is supported by rotation or tangential velocity anisotropy.
The models are thickened Mestel discs, and form a previously undiscovered part
of the Miyamoto & Nagai sequence of flattened galaxies. The properties of the
models -- axis ratios, velocity dispersions, streaming velocities and
distribution functions -- are all discussed in some detail. We pose the
question: are extremely flattened or disk-like haloes possible for the Milky
Way galaxy? This has never been examined before, as very flattened halo models
were not available. We fit the rotation curve and the vertical kinematics of
disc stars in the solar neighbourhood to constrain the overall shape of the
Galaxy. Denoting the ratio of polar axis to major axis by $q$, we show that
models with $q\lesssim 0.57$ cannot simultaneously reproduce the in-plane and
out-of-plane constraints. The kinematics of the Sagittarius galaxy also
strongly disfavour models with high flattening, as the orbital plane precession
is too great and the height reached above the Galactic plane is too small. At
least for our Galaxy, the dark halo cannot be flatter than E4 (or axis ratio $q
\sim 0.57$) at the Solar circle. Models in which the dark matter is accounted
for by a massive baryonic disc or by decaying neutrinos are therefore ruled out
by constraints from the rotation curve and the vertical kinematics.

Kuramoto model with inertia for fully coupled and diluted systems. In
particular, we examine for a Gaussian distribution of the frequencies the
transition from incoherence to coherence for increasingly large system size and
inertia. For sufficiently large inertia the transition is hysteretic and within
the hysteretic region clusters of locked oscillators of various sizes and
different levels of synchronization coexist. A modification of the mean field
theory developed by Tanaka, Lichtenberg, and Oishi [Physica D, 100 (1997) 279]
allows to derive the synchronization profile associated to each of these
clusters. We have also investigated numerically the limits of existence of the
coherent and of the incoherent solutions. The minimal coupling required to
observe the coherent state is largely independent of the system size and it
saturates to a constant value already for moderately large inertia values. The
incoherent state is observable up to a critical coupling whose value saturates
for large inertia and for finite system sizes, while in the thermodinamic limit
this critical value diverges proportionally to the mass. By increasing the
inertia the transition becomes more complex, and the synchronization occurs via
the emergence of clusters of whirling oscillators. The presence of these groups
of coherently drifting oscillators induces oscillations in the order parameter.
We have shown that the transition remains hysteretic even for randomly diluted
networks up to a level of connectivity corresponding to few links per
oscillator. Finally, an application to the Italian high-voltage power grid is
reported, which reveals the emergence of quasi-periodic oscillations in the
order parameter due to the simultaneous presence of many competing whirling
clusters.

It is a close relative of
Hernquist's model, being generated by the same transformation but this time
applied to the logarithmic potential rather than the point mass. The density is
proportional to (distance)$^{-1}$ at small radii, whilst the rotation curve is
flat at large radii. Isotropic and radially anisotropic distributions functions
are readily found, and the intrinsic and line of sight kinematical quantities
are available as simple formulae. We also provide an analytical approximation
to the Hamiltonian as a function of the actions. As an application, we study
the kinematic properties of stellar haloes and tracers in elliptical galaxies.
We show that the radial velocity dispersion of a power-law population in a
galaxy with a flat rotation curve always tends to the constant value. This
holds true irrespective of the anisotropy or the lengthscales of the dark or
luminous matter. An analogous result holds for the line of sight or projected
velocity dispersion of a power-law surface brightness profile. The radial
velocity dispersion of Population II stars in the Milky Way is a strongly
declining function of Galactocentric radius. So, if the rotation curve is flat,
we conclude that the stellar halo density cannot follow a power-law at large
radii, but must decrease more sharply (like an Einasto profile) or be abruptly
truncated at large radii. Both the starcount and kinematic data of the Milky
Way stellar halo are well-represented by an Einasto profile with index
$m\approx 2$ and effective radius $\approx 20$ kpc.

squared distances to the vertices is the Karcher mean relative to the weights.
Using barycentric coordinates as the weights, we obtain a smooth map from the
standard Euclidean simplex to the manifold. A Riemannian simplex is defined as
the image of this barycentric coordinate map. In this work we articulate
criteria that guarantee that the barycentric coordinate map is a smooth
embedding. If it is not, we say the Riemannian simplex is degenerate. Quality
measures for the ""thickness"" or ""fatness"" of Euclidean simplices can be adapted
to apply to these Riemannian simplices. For manifolds of dimension 2, the
simplex is non-degenerate if it has a positive quality measure, as in the
Euclidean case. However, when the dimension is greater than two, non-degeneracy
can be guaranteed only when the quality exceeds a positive bound that depends

significant influence of macroscopic deformations on the core-energy of
Shockley partials. We show that this dependence of the core-energy on
macroscopic deformations results in an additional force on dislocations, beyond

a bulk form diluted ferromagnetic semiconductor (DFS) Li1.15(Zn0.9Mn0.1)P with
T_C ~ 22 K. MuSR results confirm the gradual development of ferromagnetic
ordering below T_C with a nearly 100% magnetic ordered volume. Despite its low
carrier density, the relation between static internal field and Curie
temperature observed for Li(Zn,Mn)P is consistent with the trend found in
(Ga,Mn)As and other bulk DFSs, indicating these systems share a common
mechanism for the ferromagnetic exchange interaction. Li1+y(Zn1-xMnx)P has the
advantage of decoupled carrier and spin doping, where Mn2+ substitution for
Zn2+ introduces spins and Li+ off-stoichiometry provides carriers. This
advantage enables us to investigate the influence of overdoped Li on the
ferromagnetic ordered state. Overdoping Li suppresses both T_C and saturation
moments for a certain amount of spins, which indicates that more carriers are
detrimental to the ferromagnetic exchange interaction, and that a delicate
balance between charge and spin densities is required to achieve highest T_C.

very rich (richness class 3) cluster cataloged as z = 0.1066. We discover the
He-like Fe K-shell line from the central region for the first time, and find
that the X-ray spectrum yields a high redshift of 0.215^{+0.007}_{-0.006}. On
the other hand, the spectrum of the southwestern region is fitted with a
redshift of 0.11 \pm 0.02 by the He-like Fe L-shell lines, consistent with the
optically determined value. The gas temperature, metal abundance, and core
radius of the X-ray emission in the central region are 3.8 \pm 0.2 keV, 0.20
\pm 0.05 Z_solar and 450 \pm 40 kpc, respectively, while those in the
southwestern region are 2.0 \pm 0.2 keV, 0.41^{+0.17}_{-0.13} Z_solar and
220^{+90}_{-70} kpc, respectively. These parameters are typical for clusters.
We thus conclude that Abell 1674 consists of two independent clusters, A1674-C
at z ~0.22 and A1674-SW at z ~0.11, overlapping along the line of sight. The
X-ray luminosities of A1674-C within r = 2 Mpc is 15.9 \pm 0.6 \times 10^{43}
erg s^{-1} in the 0.1-2.4 keV energy band, while that for A1674-SW is 1.25 \pm
0.07 \times 10^{43} erg s^{-1}. Both are consistent with those expected from
the L-T relation of clusters within a factor of 2. This is another support for
our conclusion.

shape to an elongated axisymmetric plasma shape that improves the energy
confinement time and the triple product, which is a generally used figure of
merit for the conditions needed for fusion reactor performance. However, the
elongated plasma cross section introduces a vertical instability that demands a
real-time feedback control loop to stabilize the plasma vertical position and
velocity. At the Tokamak \`a Configuration Variable (TCV) in-vessel poloidal
field coils driven by fast switching power supplies are used to stabilize
highly elongated plasmas. TCV plasma experiments have used a PID algorithm
based controller to correct the plasma vertical position. In late 2013
experiments a new optimal real-time controller was tested improving the
stability of the plasma.
  This contribution describes the new optimal real-time controller developed.
The choice of the model that describes the plasma response to the actuators is
discussed. The high order model that is initially implemented demands the
application of a mathematical order reduction and the validation of the new
reduced model. The lower order model is used to derive the time optimal control
law. A new method for the construction of the switching curves of a bang-bang
controller is presented that is based on the state-space trajectories that
optimize the time to target of the system.
  A closed loop controller simulation tool was developed to test different

challenge arises from the need to maintain structurally consistent matches
among all the individual entities across different camera views. We propose
PRISM, a structured matching method to jointly account for these challenges. We
view the global problem as a weighted graph matching problem and estimate edge
weights by learning to predict them based on the co-occurrences of visual
patterns in the training examples. These co-occurrence based scores in turn
account for appearance changes by inferring likely and unlikely visual
co-occurrences appearing in training instances. We implement PRISM on single

more small things than large ones, e.g., far more small geographic features
than large ones on the earth surface, or far more large-scale maps than
small-scale maps for a geographic region. This paper attempts to argue and
provide evidence for the fractal nature of maps and mapping. It is the
underlying fractal structure of geographic features, either natural or
human-made, that make reality mappable, large-scale maps generalizable, and
cities imageable. The fractal nature is also what underlies the beauty of maps.
After introducing some key fractal concepts such as recursion, self-similarity,
scaling ratio, and scaling exponent, this paper demonstrates that fractal
thought is rooted in long-standing map-making practices such as series maps
subdivision, visual hierarchy, and T\""opfer's radical law. Drawing on previous
studies on head/tail breaks, mapping can be considered a head/tail breaks
process; that is to divide things around an average, according to their
geometric, topological and/or semantic properties, into the head (for those
above the average) and the tail (for those below the average), and recursively
continue the dividing process for the head for map generalization, statistical
mapping, and cognitive mapping. Given the fractal nature of maps and mapping,
cartography should be considered a perfect combination of science and art, and
scaling must be formulated as a law of cartography or that of geography in
general.
