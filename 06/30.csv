called volatility homogenisation decomposition, and has been designed
specifically to aid the forecasting of price changes on financial markets. The
authors of this method have attempted to prove the its usefulness by applying a
specific forecasting procedure and determining the effectiveness of this
procedure on the decomposed time series, as compared with the original time
series. This is problematic in at least two ways. First, the choice of the
forecasting procedure obviously has an effect on the results, rendering them
non-exhaustive. Second, the results obtained were not completely convincing,
with some values falling under 50% guessing rate. Additionally, only nine
Australian stocks were being investigated, which further limits the scope of
this proof. In this study we propose to find the usefulness of volatility
homogenisation by calculating the predictability of the decomposed time series

applying information-theoretic notion of entropy rate to quantify
predictability, which guarantees the result is not tied to a specific method of

corresponding CTMC is needed for some standard distributions, in particular
most distributions with regions of zero density such as uniform or shifted
distributions. Addressing this class of distributions, we suggest an
alternative representation by CTMC extended with discrete-time transitions.
Using discrete-time transitions we split the density function into multiple
intervals. Within each interval, we then approximate the density with standard
phase-type fitting. We provide an experimental evidence that our method
requires only a moderate number of states to approximate such distributions
with regions of zero density. Furthermore, the usage of CTMC with discrete-time

also with the depth-$3$ set-multilinear circuits (due to Agrawal-Saha-Saxena

  The depth-$3$ model has recently gained much importance, as it has become a
stepping-stone to understanding general arithmetic circuits. Its restriction to
multilinearity has known exponential lower bounds but no nontrivial blackbox
identity tests. In this paper, we take a step towards designing such
hitting-sets. We give the first subexponential whitebox PIT for the sum of
constantly many set-multilinear depth-$3$ circuits. To achieve this, we define
notions of distance and base sets. Distance, for a multilinear depth-$3$
circuit, measures how far are the partitions from a mere refinement. We design
a hitting-set in time $n^{O(d \log n)}$ for $d$-distance. Further, we give an
extension of our result to models where the distance is large but it is small
when restricted to certain base sets (of variables).
  We also explore a new model of ROABP where the factor-matrices are invertible
(called invertible-factor ROABP). We design a hitting-set in time
poly($n^{w^2}$) for width-$w$ invertible-factor ROABP. Further, we could do
without the invertibility restriction when $w=2$. Previously, the best result

  Genetic Algorithm","9 pages, 11 figures, uses algorithm2e.sty",,,,"cs.PF cs.NE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Exploration of task mappings plays a crucial role in achieving high
performance in heterogeneous multi-processor system-on-chip (MPSoC) platforms.
The problem of optimally mapping a set of tasks onto a set of given
heterogeneous processors for maximal throughput has been known, in general, to
be NP-complete. The problem is further exacerbated when multiple applications
(i.e., bigger task sets) and the communication between tasks are also
considered. Previous research has shown that Genetic Algorithms (GA) typically
are a good choice to solve this problem when the solution space is relatively
small. However, when the size of the problem space increases, classic genetic
algorithms still suffer from the problem of long evolution times. To address
this problem, this paper proposes a novel bias-elitist genetic algorithm that
is guided by domain-specific heuristics to speed up the evolution process.
Experimental results reveal that our proposed algorithm is able to handle large
scale task mapping problems and produces high-quality mapping solutions in only
a short time period.

distinctive to open source software, are now found in many other ventures. Some
of these ventures are internet-based: Wikipedia, online forums and communities.
Others are off-line: in medicine, science, and everyday life. Such ventures
have been affecting traditional firms, and may represent a new organizational
form. Despite the impact of such ventures, questions remain about their
operating principles and performance. Here we define open collaboration (OC),
the underlying set of principles, and propose that it is a robust engine for
innovation and production. First, we review multiple OC ventures and identify
four defining principles. In all instances, participants create goods and
services of economic value, they exchange and reuse each other's work, they
labor purposefully with just loose coordination, and they permit anyone to
contribute and consume. These principles distinguish OC from other
organizational forms, such as firms or cooperatives. Next, we turn to
performance. To understand the performance of OC, we develop a computational
model, combining innovation theory with recent evidence on human cooperation.
We identify and investigate three elements that affect performance: the
cooperativeness of participants, the diversity of their needs, and the degree
to which the goods are rival (subtractable). Through computational experiments,
we find that OC performs well even in seemingly harsh environments: when
cooperators are a minority, free riders are present, diversity is lacking, or
goods are rival. We conclude that OC is viable and likely to expand into new
domains. The findings also inform the discussion on new organizational forms,
collaborative and communal.

of voting rules for aggregation. First, we observe that rating, one of the
common alternatives to ranking, manifested effects of bias in our data. Second,

that are organized into networks which govern the flow of resources can learn
to recognize newly emerging opportunities distributed in the environment. This
paper argues that the system does this through a process analogous to neural
network learning with relative status playing the role of synaptic weights.
Hazy showed computationally that learning of this type can occur even when
resource allocation decision makers have no direct visibility into the
environment, have no direct understanding of the opportunity, and are not
involved in their exploitation except to the extent that they evaluate the
success or failure of funded projects. Effectively, the system of interactions
learns which individuals have the best access to information and other
resources within the ecosystem. Hazy [2012] calls this previously unidentified
emergence phenomenon: Influence Process Structural Learning (IPSL). In the
prior model of IPSL, a three-tiered organizational structure was predetermined
in the model design [Hazy 2012]. These initial conditions delimit the extent to
which the emergence of collective intelligence can be posited because the model
itself assumes a defined structure. This work contributes to the field by
extending the IPSL argument for collective intelligence to a holistic emergence
argument. It begins by briefly reviewing previously published work. It
continues the conversation by adding two additional steps: Firstly, it shows
how a three-tier organizing structure might emerge through known complexity
mechanisms. In this case the mechanism identified is preferential attachment
[Barabasi 2002]. Secondly, the paper shows how collective intelligence can
emerge within a system of agents when the influence structure among these
agents is treated as a the genetic algorithm.

out that six thermodynamically stable BaTiO$_{3}$ phases (paraelectric phase

components undergo reproduction and variation. However, a role for selection in
cultural evolutionary dynamics is less clear. Often neutral evolution (also
known as 'drift') models, are used to explain the evolution of human
communication systems, and cultural evolution more generally. Under this
account, cultural change is unbiased: for instance, vocabulary, baby names and
pottery designs have been found to spread through random copying.
  While drift is the null hypothesis for models of cultural evolution it does
not always adequately explain empirical results. Alternative models include
cultural selection, which assumes variant adoption is biased. Theoretical
models of human communication argue that during conversation interlocutors are
biased to adopt the same labels and other aspects of linguistic representation
(including prosody and syntax). This basic alignment mechanism has been
extended by computer simulation to account for the emergence of linguistic
conventions. When agents are biased to match the linguistic behavior of their
interlocutor, a single variant can propagate across an entire population of
interacting computer agents. This behavior-matching account operates at the
level of the individual. We call it the Conformity-biased model. Under a
different selection account, called content-biased selection, functional
selection or replicator selection, variant adoption depends upon the intrinsic
value of the particular variant (e.g., ease of learning or use). This second
alternative account operates at the level of the cultural variant. Following
Boyd and Richerson we call it the Content-biased model. The present paper tests
the drift model and the two biased selection models' ability to explain the
spread of communicative signal variants in an experimental micro-society.

surprising accuracy of a group's aggregated judgments. Less is known, however,
about the generality of crowd wisdom. For example, are crowds wise even if
their members have systematic judgmental biases, or can influence each other
before members render their judgments? If so, are there situations in which we
can expect a crowd to be less accurate than skilled individuals? We provide a
precise but general definition of crowd wisdom: A crowd is wise if a linear
aggregate, for example a mean, of its members' judgments is closer to the
target value than a randomly, but not necessarily uniformly, sampled member of
the crowd. Building on this definition, we develop a theoretical framework for
examining, a priori, when and to what degree a crowd will be wise. We
systematically investigate the boundary conditions for crowd wisdom within this
framework and determine conditions under which the accuracy advantage for
crowds is maximized. Our results demonstrate that crowd wisdom is highly
robust: Even if judgments are biased and correlated, one would need to nearly
deterministically select only a highly skilled judge before an individual's
judgment could be expected to be more accurate than a simple averaging of the
crowd. Our results also provide an accuracy rationale behind the need for
diversity of judgments among group members. Contrary to folk explanations of
crowd wisdom which hold that judgments should ideally be independent so that
errors cancel out, we find that crowd wisdom is maximized when judgments
systematically differ as much as possible. We re-analyze data from two
published studies that confirm our theoretical results.

people make false intuitive conclusions, and are exposed to the analytic output
of their peers, they recognize and adopt this correct output. But they fail to
engage analytical reasoning in similar subsequent tasks. Thus, humans exhibit
an 'unreflective copying bias,' which limits their social learning to the
output, rather than the process, of their peers' reasoning -even when doing so
requires minimal effort and no technical skill. In contrast to much recent work

cluster. In this work we obtain the basic properties of its dominant old
stellar population. Firstly, we derive its structural properties by
constructing a stellar surface density map of the central 1000"" using
extinction corrected star counts from VISTA, WFC3/IR and VLT/NACO data. We can
describe the profile with a two-component model. The inner, slightly flattened
(q=0.80+/-0.04) component is the nuclear cluster, while the outer component
corresponds to the stellar component of the circumnuclear zone. We measure for
the nuclear cluster a half-light radius of 178+/-51""~7+/-2 pc and a luminosity
of M_Ks=-16.0+/-0.5. Secondly, we enlarge the range over which detailed
dynamics are available from 1 pc to 4 pc. We obtain more than 10000 individual
proper motions from NACO data, and more than 2500 radial velocities from
VLT/SINFONI data. We determine the cluster mass by means of isotropic spherical
Jeans modeling. We fix the distance to the Galactic Center and the mass of the
supermassive black hole. We model the cluster either with a constant mass to
light ratio or with a power law mass model. For the latter we obtain a slope of
delta_M=1.18+/-0.06. Assuming spherical symmetry, we get a nuclear cluster mass
within 100"" of M_100""=6.09+/- 0.53_(fix_R_0) +/- 0.97_(R_0) * 10^6 M_sun for
both modeling approaches. A model which includes the observed flattening gives
a 47% larger mass, see Chatzopoulos et al. 2015. Our results slightly favor a
core over a cusp in the mass profile. By minimizing the number of unbound stars
within 8"" in our sample we obtain a distance estimate of
R$_0=8.53^{+0.21}_{-0.15}$ kpc, where an a priori relation between R_0 and SMBH
mass from stellar orbits is used. Combining our mass and flux we obtain
M/L=0.51+/-0.12 M_sun/L_(sun Ks). This is roughly consistent with a Chabrier
IMF.

recovers the true partition with high probability even when the gap of the

is optimal. Finally, we conduct experiments which verify the value of the

individuals by simply using the mean, median or geometric mean of the
individual estimations [Galton 1907, Surowiecki 2005, Page 2008]. However, this
is true only for some tasks and in general these collective estimations show
strong biases. The method fails also when allowing for social interactions,
which makes the collective estimation worse as individuals tend to converge to
the biased result [Lorenz et al. 2011]. Here we show that there is a bright
side of this apparently negative impact of social interactions into collective
intelligence. We found that some individuals resist the social influence and,
when using the median of this subgroup, we can eliminate the bias of the wisdom
of the full crowd. To find this subgroup of individuals more confident in their
private estimations than in the social influence, we model individuals as
estimators that combine private and social information with different relative
weights [Perez-Escudero & de Polavieja 2011, Arganda et al. 2012]. We then
computed the geometric mean for increasingly smaller groups by eliminating
those using in their estimations higher values of the social influence weight.
The trend obtained in this procedure gives unbiased results, in contrast to the
simpler method of computing the median of the complete group. Our results show
that, while a simple operation like the mean, median or geometric mean of a
group may not allow groups to make good estimations, a more complex operation
taking into account individuality in the social dynamics can lead to a better
collective intelligence.

secondarily by meme consumers, whose individual sharing decisions accumulate to
determine total meme propagation. We characterize this as a sender/receiver
sequence in which the first sender is also the creator. This sequence consists
of two distinct processes, the creation process and the sharing process. We
investigated these processes separately to determine their individual influence
on sharing outcomes. Our study observed participants creating memes in the lab.
We then tracked the sharing of those memes, derived a model of sharing
behavior, and implemented our sharing model in a contagion simulation.
  Although we assume meme consumers typically have little or no information
about a meme's creator when making a decision about whether to share a meme
(and vice versa), we nevertheless ask whether consumer re-sharing behavior can
be predicted based on features of the creator. Using human participants, web
log monitoring, and statistical model fitting, the resulting Creator Model of
Re-sharing Behavior predicts 11.5% of the variance in the behavior of
consumers. Even when we know nothing about re-sharers of a meme, we can predict
something about their behavior by observing the creation process.
  To investigate the individual re-sharing decisions that, together, constitute
a meme's total consumer response, we built a statistical model from human
observation. Receivers make their decision to share as a function of the meme's
content and their reaction to it, which we model as a consumer's decision to
share. The resulting Consumer Model of Sharing Decisions describes 37.5% of the

polls are generally not due to actual shifts in vote intention, but rather are
the result of temporary periods of relatively low response rates among
supporters of the reportedly slumping candidate. This work shows great promise
for using non-representative polling to measure public opinion and the first

social contagion can be modeled as an infection process where a specific state
(adoption of product, fad, knowledge, behavior, etc.) spreads from individual
to individual through links between them. In the meantime, other forms of
social contagion may better be understood as a diffusion process where the
state of an individual tends to assimilate with the social norm (i.e., local
average state) within his/her neighborhood.
  Unlike infection scenarios where influence is nonlinear, unidirectional,
fast, and potentially disruptive, social diffusion is linear, bidirectional,
gradual, and converging. The distance between an individual's state and his/her
neighbors' average state always decreases, and thus a homogeneous global state
is guaranteed to be the network's stable equilibrium state in the long run.
This does not sound as intriguing or exciting as infection dynamics, which
might be why there are very few studies on mathematical models of social
diffusion processes.
  Here, this study attempts to shed new light on an unrecognized characteristic
of social diffusion, i.e., non-trivial drift it can cause to the network's
global average state. Although somewhat counterintuitive, such global drift is
indeed possible because, unlike physical diffusion processes, social diffusion
processes are not conservational. In what follows, a mathematical model of
social diffusion will be presented to explain the mechanism of this phenomenon,
and some possible collective actions for influencing the direction of global
drift will be proposed. The relevance of social diffusion to individual and
collective improvement will be discussed briefly, with an emphasis on
educational applications.

varied the structure of 16-person networks we investigate how an organization's
network structure may be constructed to optimize performance in complex
problem-solving tasks. Problem solving involves both search for information and
search for theories to make sense of that information. We show that the effect
of network structure is opposite for these two equally important forms of
search. Dense clustering encourages members of a network to generate more
diverse information, but it also has the power to discourage the generation of
diverse theories: clustering promotes exploration in information space, but
decreases exploration in solution space. Previous research, tending to focus on
only one of those two spaces, had produced inconsistent conclusions about the
value of network clustering. By adopting an experimental platform on which
information was measured separately from solutions, we were able to reconcile
past contradictions and clarify the effects of network clustering on
performance. The finding both provides a sharper tool for structuring
organizations for knowledge work and reveals the challenges inherent in
manipulating network structure to enhance performance, as the communication
structure that helps one aspect of problem solving may harm the other.

can be expressed in terms of just their mass, charge and spin angular momentum.
The recent discovery of approximately equation-of-state-independent relations
among certain multipole moments in neutron stars suggests that they are also
approximately bald. We here explore the yet unknown origin for this
universality. First, we investigate which region of the neutron star's interior
and of the equation of state is most responsible for the universality. We find
that the universal relation between the moment of inertia and the quadrupole
moment is dominated by the star's outer-core, a shell of width (50-95)% of the
total radius, which corresponds to the density range
$(10^{14}$-$10^{15})$g/cm$^3$. Second, we study the impact on the universality
of approximating stellar isodensity contours as self-similar ellipsoids. An
analytical calculation in the Newtonian limit reveals that the shape of the
ellipsoids does not affect the universal relations, but relaxing the
self-similarity assumption can completely destroy it. Third, we investigate the
eccentricity profiles of rotating relativistic stars and find that the
ellipticity is roughly constant, with variations of roughly (20-30)% in the
region that matters to the universal relations. Fourth, we repeat the above
analysis for non-compact, regular stars and find that the ellipticity is not
constant, with variations that easily exceed 100% and universality is lost.
These findings suggest that universality arises as an emergent approximate
symmetry: as one flows in the stellar-structure phase space from non-compact
star region to the relativistic star region, the eccentricity variation inside
stars decreases, leading to approximate self-similarity in their isodensity
contours, which then leads to the universal behavior observed in their exterior
multipole moments.

first to consider the simple case where only asphaltene molecules are counted
in a nanoaggregate. We used a master equation approach and a related
statistical mechanics model. The linear asphaltene nanoaggregates behave as a
rigid linear chain. The most complicated case where all aromatic molecules are
counted in a nanoaggregate is then discussed. The linear aggregates where all
aromatic molecules are counted seem to behave as a flexible linear chain.

using the $SU(4)/SU(2)\times SU(2)\times U(1)$ harmonics which was earlier
applied to the abelian gauge theory. The N=4 non-abelian constraints in a
standard superspace are reformulated as the harmonic-superspace equations for
two basic analytic superfields: the independent superfield strength W of a
dimension 1 and the dimensionless harmonic gauge 4-prepotential V having the
$U(1)$ charge 2. These constraint equations I manifestly depend on the
Grassmann coordinates $\theta$, although they are covariant under the unusual
N=4 supersymmetry transformations. We analyze an alternative harmonic formalism
of the supergauge theory for two unconstrained nonabelian analytic superfields
W and V. The gauge-invariant action A(W,V) in this formalism contains $\theta$
factors in each term, it is invariant under the $SU(4)$ automorphism group. In
this model, the interaction of two infinite-dimensional N=4 supermultiplets
with the physical and auxiliary fields arises at the level of component fields.
The action A(W,V) generate analytic equations of motion II alternative to the
harmonic-superspace superfield constraints I. Both sets of equations give us
the equivalent equations for the physical component fields of the $N=4$ gauge
supermultiplet, they connect auxiliary and physical fields of two superfields.
The nonlinear effective interaction of the abelian harmonic superfield W is
constructed.

seek an alternative parameterization with fewer variables that produces

subspace defined by important directions in the model's input space; input
perturbations along these directions change the model's prediction more, on
average, than perturbations orthogonal to the important directions. We describe
a method for checking if a model admits an exploitable active subspace, and we
apply this method to a single-diode solar cell model with five input
parameters. We find that the maximum power of the solar cell has a dominant
one-dimensional active subspace, which enables us to perform thorough parameter

The current study seeks to answer this question with a comprehensive dataset
(about 100,000 records) from very disparate sources (F1000, Altmetric, and an
in-house database based on Web of Science). In the F1000 peer review system,
experts attach particular tags to scientific papers which indicate whether a
paper could be of interest for science or rather for other segments of society.
The results show that papers with the tag ""good for teaching"" do achieve higher
altmetric counts than papers without this tag - if the quality of the papers is
controlled. At the same time, a higher citation count is shown especially by
papers with a tag that is specifically scientifically oriented (""new finding"").
The findings indicate that papers tailored for a readership outside the area of
research should lead to societal impact. If altmetric data is to be used for
the measurement of societal impact, the question arises of its normalization.
In bibliometrics, citations are normalized for the papers' subject area and
publication year. This study has taken a second analytic step involving a
possible normalization of altmetric data. As the results show there are
particular scientific topics which are of especial interest for a wide
audience. Since these more or less interesting topics are not completely
reflected in Thomson Reuters' journal sets, a normalization of altmetric data
should not be based on the level of subject categories, but on the level of
topics.

we test the hypothesis by analyzing recent, foreground-reduced cosmic microwave

masked CMB temperature anisotropies in such a way that the combined variables
can be treated as statistically independent samples. We find evidence against
the zero mean hypothesis in two particular ranges of multipoles, with
significance levels of $2.5 \sigma$ and $3.1 \sigma$ in the multipole ranges of
$\ell \approx 61$-$86$ and $213$-$256$, respectively, for both the Planck and
Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe maps. The latter signal is consistent with
our previous result found by using brute-force Monte-Carlo simulations.
However, within the method employed in this paper we conclude that the zero
mean hypothesis is consistent with the current CMB data on the basis of
Stouffer's weighted Z statistics, which takes multiple testing into account.

for a multiuser cognitive network is proposed to significantly improve spectrum
efficiency. For such a cognitive network, there are two important and limited
resources that should be distributed in a comprehensive manner, namely feedback
bits and time duration. First, regarding the feedback bits, there are two
components: sensing component (used to convey various users' sensing results)
and accessing component (used to feedback channel state information). A large
sensing component can support more users to perform cooperative sensing, which
results in high sensing precision. However, a large accessing component is
preferred as well, as it has a direct impact on the performance in the
multiuser cognitive network when multi-antenna technique, such as zero-forcing
beamforming (ZFBF), is utilized. Second, the tradeoff of sensing and accessing
duration in a transmission interval needs to be determined, so that the sum
transmission rate is optimized while satisfying the interference constraint. In
addition, the above two resources are interrelated and inversive under some
conditions. Specifically, sensing time can be saved by utilizing more sensing
feedback bits for a given performance objective. Hence, the resources should be
allocation in a jointly manner. Based on the joint optimization framework and
the intrinsic relationship between the two resources, we propose two joint
resource allocation schemes by maximizing the average sum transmission rate in
a multiuser multi-antenna cognitive network. Simulation results show that, by
adopting the joint resource allocation schemes, obvious performance gain can be
obtained over the traditional fixed strategies.

locally deformed halfplanes or wedges, or infinite strips, alternatively they
are the exterior of a bounded obstacle. In the situation when the Robin
condition is strongly attractive, we derive a two-term asymptotic formula in
which the next-to-leading term is determined by the extremum of the boundary
curvature. We also discuss the non-asymptotic case of attractive boundary
interaction and show that the discrete spectrum is nonempty if the domain is a
local deformation of a halfplane or a wedge of angle less than $\pi$, and it is
void if the domain is concave.

question in stellar physics. An appealing option is that hydrogen-deficient W-R
stars are the progenitors of some H-poor supernova (SN) explosions of Types
IIb, Ib, and Ic. A blue object, having luminosity and colors consistent with
those of some W-R stars, has been recently identified at the location of a
SN~Ib in pre-explosion images but has not yet been conclusively determined to
have been the progenitor. Similar previous works have so far only resulted in
nondetections. Comparison of early photometric observations of Type Ic
supernovae with theoretical models suggests that the progenitor stars had radii
<10^12 cm, as expected for some W-R stars. However, the hallmark signature of
W-R stars, their emission-line spectra, cannot be probed by such studies. Here,

are no univocal criteria for the selection of the winning (consensus) ranking
and the outcome is known to depend sensibly on the adopted rule. Building upon
XVIII century Condorcet theory, whose idea was to maximize total voter
satisfaction, we propose here the addition of a new basic principle (dimension)
to guide the selection: satisfaction should be distributed among voters as
equally as possible. With this new criterion we identify an optimal set of
rankings. They range from the Condorcet solution to the one which is the most
egalitarian with respect to the voters. We show that highly egalitarian
rankings have the important property to be more stable with respect to
fluctuations and that classical consensus rankings (Copeland, Tideman, Schulze)
often turn out to be non optimal. The new dimension we have introduced
provides, when used together with that of Condorcet, a clear classification of
all the possible rankings. By increasing awareness in selecting a consensus
ranking our method may lead to social choices which are more egalitarian
compared to those achieved by presently available voting systems.

of Bayesian networks is very hard to tackle: its computational complexity is
super-exponential in the number of nodes in the worst case and polynomial in
most real-world scenarios.
  Efficient implementations of score-based structure learning benefit from past
and current research in optimisation theory, which can be adapted to the task
by using the network score as the objective function to maximise. This is not
true for approaches based on conditional independence tests, called
constraint-based learning algorithms. The only optimisation in widespread use,
backtracking, leverages the symmetries implied by the definitions of
neighbourhood and Markov blanket.
  In this paper we illustrate how backtracking is implemented in recent
versions of the bnlearn R package, and how it degrades the stability of
Bayesian network structure learning for little gain in terms of speed. As an
alternative, we describe a software architecture and framework that can be used
to parallelise constraint-based structure learning algorithms (also implemented
in bnlearn) and we demonstrate its performance using four reference networks
and two real-world data sets from genetics and systems biology. We show that on
modern multi-core or multiprocessor hardware parallel implementations are
preferable over backtracking, which was developed when single-processor
machines were the norm.

varying, as well as a fixed, dust emissivity index (beta). An overall metal
distribution is also derived using data collected from the literature. We use a
simple analytical model of the evolution of the dust in a galaxy with dust
contributed by stellar sources and interstellar grain growth, and fit this
model to the radial dust-to-metals distribution across the galaxy. Our analysis
shows that the dust-to-gas gradient in M31 is steeper than the metallicity
gradient, suggesting interstellar dust growth is (or has been) important in
M31. We argue that M31 helps build a case for cosmic dust in galaxies being the
result of substantial interstellar grain growth, while the net dust production
from stars may be limited. We note, however, that the efficiency of dust
production in stars, e.g., in supernovae (SNe) ejecta and/or stellar
atmospheres, and grain destruction in the interstellar medium (ISM) may be
degenerate in our simple model. We can conclude that interstellar grain growth
by accretion is likely at least as important as stellar dust production
channels in building the cosmic dust component in M31.

investigate the minimal surfaces spanned on boundaries of spherical domains at

overlapping domains, and touching domains. In all these cases we find the

be estimated. Thirty-two possible Cepheid stars (young pulsating variable
stars) in the direction of the Galactic bulge were recently identified. With
their well-calibrated period-luminosity relationships, Cepheid stars are useful
distance indicators. When observations of these stars are made in two colours,
so that their distance and reddening can be determined simultaneously, the
problems of dust obscuration are minimized. Here we report that five of the
candidates are classical Cepheid stars. These five stars are distributed from
approximately one to two kiloparsecs above and below the plane of the Galaxy,

power reduction is the challenge associated with a large amount of parallel

as Selective Match-Line Energizer Content Addressable Memory (SMLE-CAM) which
energizes only those MLs (Match-Line) whose first three bits are conditionally
matched with corresponding first three search bit using special architecture
which comprises of novel XNOR-CAM cell and novel XOR-CAM cell. The rest of the
CAM chain is followed by NOR-CAM cell. The 256 X 144 bit SMLE-CAM is
implemented in TSMC 90 nm technology and its robustness across PVT variation is
verified. The post-layout simulation result shows, it has energy metric of
0.115 fJ/bit/search with search time 361.6 ps, the best reported so far. The
maximum operating frequency is 1GHz.

appliances are in use at what times. Monitoring individual appliances is costly
and intrusive, whereas data on overall household electricity use is more easily
obtained. In this paper, we consider the energy disaggregation problem where a
household's electricity consumption is disaggregated into the component
appliances. The factorial hidden Markov model (FHMM) is a natural model to fit
this data. We enhance this generic model by introducing two constraints on the
state sequence of the FHMM. The first is to use a non-homogeneous Markov chain,
modelling how appliance usage varies over the day, and the other is to enforce
that at most one chain changes state at each time step. This yields a new model
which we call the interleaved factorial non-homogeneous hidden Markov model
(IFNHMM). We evaluated the ability of this model to perform disaggregation in
an ultra-low frequency setting, over a data set of 251 English households. In
this new setting, the IFNHMM outperforms the FHMM in terms of recovering the
energy used by the component appliances, due to that stronger constraints have
been imposed on the states of the hidden Markov chains. Interestingly, we find
that the variability in model performance across households is significant,
underscoring the importance of using larger scale data in the disaggregation
problem.

concerns the emergence of spatial correlations among plastic rearrangements

paper, the rate of plastic events in a Poiseuille flow is experimentally
measured on a confined foam in a Hele-Shaw geometry. The correlation with
independently measured velocity profiles is quantified. To go beyond a
limitation of the experiments, namely the presence of wall friction which
complicates the relation between shear stress and shear rate, we compare the
experiments with simulations of emulsion droplets based on the
lattice-Boltzmann method, which are performed both with, and without, wall
friction. Our results indicate a correlation between the localisation length of
the velocity profiles and the localisation length of the number of plastic
events. Finally, unprecedented results on the distribution of the orientation
of plastic events show that there is a non-trivial correlation with the
underlying local shear strain. These features, not previously reported for a
confined foam, lend further support to the idea that cooperativity mechanisms,
originally invoked for concentrated emulsions (Goyon et al. 2008), have
parallels in the behaviour of other soft-glassy materials.

ubiquitously observed and exploited in both natural and man-made settings,
thus, minimal models for its description are essential. In a model with
continuous space and time we find that if two particles arrive symmetrically in
a plane at a large angle, then (i) radial repulsion and (ii) linear
self-propelling toward a fixed preferred speed are sufficient for them to
depart at a smaller angle. For this local gain of momentum explicit velocity
alignment is not necessary, nor are adhesion/attraction, inelasticity or
anisotropy of the particles, or nonlinear drag. With many particles obeying
these microscopic rules of motion we find that their spatial confinement to a
square with periodic boundaries (which is an indirect form of attraction) leads
to stable macroscopic ordering. After varying the density of particles at
constant system size and varying the size of the system with constant particle
density we predict that in the infinite system size (or density) limit the
hysteresis loop disappears and the transition becomes continuous. We note that
animals, humans, drones, etc. tend to move asynchronously and are often more
responsive to motion than positions. Thus, for them velocity-based continuous
models can provide higher precision than coordinate-based models. An additional
characteristic and realistic feature of the model is that convergence to the
ordered state is fastest at a finite density, which is in contrast to models
applying (discontinuous) explicit velocity alignments and discretized time. In
summary, we find that the investigated model can provide a minimal description
of flocking.

occultations (LO), long baseline interferometry, and aperture masking
interferometry. Multi-epoch LO observations have the potential to detect a
departure of brightness profile from spherical symmetry. Each LO event provides
a uniform disk (UD) angular diameter along the position angle of the

estimators consistent with known totals of auxiliary variables and to reduce
variance. When the number of auxiliary variables is large, calibration on all
the variables may lead to estimators of totals whose mean squared error (MSE)
is larger than the MSE of the Horvitz-Thompson estimator even if this simple
estimator does not take account of the available auxiliary information. We
study in this paper a new technique based on dimension reduction through
principal components that can be useful in this large dimension context.
Calibration is performed on the first principal components, which can be viewed
as the synthetic variables containing the most important part of the
variability of the auxiliary variables. When some auxiliary variables play a
more important role than the others, the method can be adapted to provide an
exact calibration on these important variables. Some asymptotic properties are
given in which the number of variables is allowed to tend to infinity with the
population size. A data driven selection criterion of the number of principal
components ensuring that all the sampling weights remain positive is discussed.
The methodology of the paper is illustrated, in a multipurpose context, by an
application to the estimation of electricity consumption for each day of a week
with the help of 336 auxiliary variables consisting of the past consumption
measured every half an hour over the previous week.

mesh is not aligned to the interface. The method is based on taking traces of a
standard finite element space both on the bulk domains and the embedded
surface. The numerical approach allows an implicit definition of the surface as
the zero level of a level-set function. Optimal order error estimates are
proved for the finite element method both in the bulk-surface energy norm and
the $L^2$-norm. The analysis is not restricted to linear finite elements and a
piecewise planar reconstruction of the surface, but also covers the

behavior of dark energy could be constrained more effectively by adding
high-redshift Hubble parameter data, such as the SDSS DR11 measurement of $H(z)
= 222\pm7$ km/sec/Mpc at z = 2.34. In this paper, we investigate the
significance of these BAO data in the flat $\Lambda$CDM model, by combining
them with the recent observational data of the Hubble constant from local
distance ladder and the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) measurements from
Planck+WP. We perform a detailed data analysis on these datasets and find that
the recent observations of BAO in SDSS DR9 and DR11 have considerable tension
with the Planck + WP measurements in the framework of the standard $\Lambda$CDM
model. The fitting results show that the main contribution to the tension comes
from the Hubble parameter measurement at redshift of $z=2.34$. But there is no
visible tension once the joint data analysis by combining the datasets of SDSS
and Planck+WP is performed. Thus in order to see whether dark energy does
evolve, we need more independent measurements of the Hubble parameter at high
redshifts.

satellite system that aggressively reuses the user link frequency resources.
Two fundamental practical challenges, namely the need to frame multiple users
per transmission and the per-antenna transmit power limitations, are addressed.
To this end, the so-called frame-based precoding problem is optimally solved
using the principles of physical layer multicasting to multiple co-channel
groups under per-antenna constraints. In this context, a novel optimization
problem that aims at maximizing the system sum rate under individual power
constraints is proposed. Added to that, the formulation is further extended to
include availability constraints. As a result, the high gains of the sum rate
optimal design are traded off to satisfy the stringent availability
requirements of satellite systems. Moreover, the throughput maximization with a
granular spectral efficiency versus SINR function, is formulated and solved.
Finally, a multicast-aware user scheduling policy, based on the channel state
information, is developed. Thus, substantial multiuser diversity gains are
gleaned. Numerical results over a realistic simulation environment exhibit as
much as 30% gains over conventional systems, even for 7 users per frame,
without modifying the framing structure of legacy communication standards.

concentrate on the distinction between two different supersymmetric models, the
MSSM and the NMSSM, as they can lead to similar low energy spectra. The NMSSM
adds a singlet superfield to the MSSM particle spectrum and simplifies
embedding a SM-like Higgs candidate with the measured mass of about 125.5 GeV.
In parts of the parameter space the Higgs sector itself does not provide
sufficient indications for the underlying model. We show that exploring the

polarized cross sections $e^+e^-\to \tilde{\chi}^0_i\tilde{\chi}^0_j$,

one can find all time-independent-profile solitary waves (standing solitons are
a specific case of these propagating waves), which exist below the linear
instability threshold; the standing and slow solitons are always unstable while
fast solitons are stable. Depending on initial perturbations, unstable solitons
either grow in an explosive manner, which means layer rupture in a finite time,
or falls apart into stable solitons. The results are derived within the

the distributed channel state information (CSI) setting. We focus in this work
on a particular distributed CSI configuration called hierarchical CSI
configuration in which the TXs can be ordered by increasing level of CSI. This
scenario is particularly relevant for future networks with heterogeneous
backhaul where the TXs connected with a weak backhaul link will receive only a
coarse estimate while the TXs with a stronger backhaul will have a more
accurate CSI. In that scenario, we formulate the optimal precoding as a team
decision problem. Solving optimally this problem is extremely challenging such
that we propose a heuristic approach allowing to obtain a simple, yet efficient
and practical, precoding algorithm. The proposed precoding algorithm exploits
the hierarchical structure of the CSI to make the transmission more robust to
the imperfect CSI knowledge at the TXs.

not universal and decay with a critical exponent that depends on the

constructive field theory methods. In the fermionic language, the height
difference $h_{\boldsymbol{\xi}}-h_{\boldsymbol{\eta}}$ takes the form of a
non-local operator, consisting of a sum of monomials along an {\it arbitrary}

the impact of the axion emission into the neutrino emission can not be

emission needs to be incorporated self-consistently into the evolution of the
white dwarfs when dealing with axion masses larger than $m_a\cos^2\beta\gtrsim
5$ meV (i.e. axion-electron coupling constant $g_{ae}\gtrsim 1.4\times
10^{-13}$). We went beyond previous works by including 5 different derivations
of the WDLF in our analysis. Then we have performed $\chi^2$-tests to have a
quantitative measure of the assessment between the theoretical WDLFs
---computed under the assumptions of different axion masses and normalization
methods--- and the observed WDLFs of the Galactic disk. While all the WDLF
studied in this work disfavour axion masses in the range suggested by
asteroseismology ($m_a\cos^2\beta\gtrsim 10$ meV; $g_{ae}\gtrsim 2.8\times

a particle with these properties is considered, the long-wavelength structure
of such a nonlinear theory is fixed to be that of general relativity. However,
here we show that these arguments conceal an implicit assumption which is
surreptitiously motivated by the very knowledge of general relativity. This is
shown by providing a counterexample: we revisit a nonlinear theory of gravity
which is not structurally equivalent to general relativity and that, in the
non-interacting limit, describes a free helicity $\pm2$ graviton. We explicitly
prove that this theory can be understood as the result of self-coupling in
complete parallelism to the well-known case of general relativity. The
assumption which was seen as natural in previous analyses but biased the result
is pointed out. This special relativistic field theory of gravity implies the
decoupling of vacuum zero-point energies of matter and passes all the known
experimental tests in gravitation.

inverse scale space (ISS) developed in applied mathematics. Our goal here is to
bring this idea to address a challenging problem in statistics, \emph{i.e.}
finding the oracle estimator which is unbiased and sign-consistent using
dynamics. We call our dynamics \emph{Bregman ISS} and \emph{Linearized Bregman
ISS}. A well-known shortcoming of LASSO and any convex regularization
approaches lies in the bias of estimators. However, we show that under proper
conditions, there exists a bias-free and sign-consistent point on the solution
paths of such dynamics, which corresponds to a signal that is the unbiased
estimate of the true signal and whose entries have the same signs as those of
the true signs, \emph{i.e.} the oracle estimator. Therefore, their solution
paths are regularization paths better than the LASSO regularization path, since
the points on the latter path are biased when sign-consistency is reached. We
also show how to efficiently compute their solution paths in both continuous
and discretized settings: the full solution paths can be exactly computed piece
by piece, and a discretization leads to \emph{Linearized Bregman iteration},
which is a simple iterative thresholding rule and easy to parallelize.
Theoretical guarantees such as sign-consistency and minimax optimal $l_2$-error
bounds are established in both continuous and discrete settings for specific
points on the paths. Early-stopping rules for identifying these points are
given. The key treatment relies on the development of differential inequalities
for differential inclusions and their discretizations, which extends the
previous results and leads to exponentially fast recovering of sparse signals
before selecting wrong ones.

that inherent value drives popularity. An alternative theory claims that
popularity is driven by the rich-get-richer effect of cumulative
advantage---certain options become more popular, not because they are higher
quality, but because they are already relatively popular. Realistically, it
seems likely that popularity is driven by neither one of these forces alone but
rather both together. Recently, researchers have begun using large-scale online
experiments to study the effect of cumulative advantage in realistic scenarios,
but there have been no large-scale studies of the combination of these two
effects. We are interested in studying a case where decision-makers observe
explicit signals of both the popularity and the quality of various options. We
derive a model for change in popularity as a function of past popularity and
past perceived quality. Our model implies that we should expect an interaction
between these two forces---popularity should amplify the effect of quality, so
that the more popular an option is, the faster we expect it to increase in
popularity with better perceived quality. We use a data set from eToro.com, an
online social investment platform, to support this hypothesis.

expanded the Hopkins & Quataert (2011) model for the mass inflow following disk
perturbations, and compare the corresponding evolution of the AGN population
with that arising in a scenario where galaxy interactions trigger AGN (IT
mode). We extended and developed the DI model by including different disk
surface density profiles, to study the maximal contribution of DI to the
evolution of the AGN population. We obtained the following results: i) for
luminosities corresponding to $M_{1450}\gtrsim -26$ the DI mode can provide the
BH accretion needed to match the observed AGN luminosity functions up to $z
\approx 4.5$; in such a luminosity range and redshift, it can compete with the
IT scenario as the main driver of cosmological evolution of AGN; ii) The DI
scenario cannot provide the observed abundance of high-luminosity QSO with
$M_{1450}\lesssim -26$ AGN, as well as the abundance of high-redhshift $z
\approx 4.5$ QSOs with $M_{1450}\lesssim -24$, while the IT scenario provides
an acceptable match up to $z \approx 6$, as found in our earliest works; iii)
The dispersion of the distributions of Eddington ratio for low- and
intermediate-luminosity AGN (bolometric $L_{AGN}$ = $10^{43}$ - $10^{45}$
erg/s) is predicted to be much smaller in the DI scenario compared to the IT
mode; iv) The above conclusions are robust with respect to the explored
variants of the Hopkins & Quataert (2011) model. We discuss the physical origin
of our findings, and how it is possible to pin down the dominant fueling
mechanism in the low-intermediate luminosity range $M_{1450}\gtrsim -26$ where
both the DI and the IT modes are viable candidates as drivers for the AGN

nanoresonators can affect the lifetime of emitters and ultimately induce strong
coupling between the emitters and the light field, while nanoantennas can
control the directionality of the emission. Expanding this control to the
manipulation of the emission of orbital angular momentum-changing transitions
would enable coupling between long-lived solid-state qubits and flying qubits.
As these transitions are associated with circular rather than linear dipoles,
such control requires detailed knowledge of the spatially dependent interaction
of a complex dipole with highly structured optical eigenstates containing local
helicity. Using a classical analogue, we experimentally map the coupling of
circular dipoles to photonic modes in a model structure, a photonic crystal
waveguide. We show that depending on the local helicity the dipoles can be made
to couple to modes either propagating to the left or to the right. The maps are
in excellent agreement with calculations. Our measurements, therefore,
demonstrate the coupling of spin to photonic pathway with near-unity (0.8 $\pm$
0.1) efficiency.

periodically arranged on a metal surface is investigated. Three main modulating
factors affecting the optical response are identified: the near-field
distribution at the wavelength of the fundamental harmonic, how SH light
couples to the diffraction orders of the lattice, and its propagation
properties inside the holes. It is shown that light generated at the second
harmonic can excite electromagnetic modes otherwise inaccessible in the linear
regime under normal incidence illumination. It is demonstrated that the
emission of SH radiation is only allowed along off-normal paths precisely due
to that symmetry. Two different regimes are studied in the context of
extraordinary optical transmission, where enhanced linear transmission either
occurs through localized electromagnetic modes or is aided by surface plasmon
polaritons (SPPs). While localized resonances in metallic hole arrays have been
previously investigated, the role played by SPPs in SH generation has not been
addressed so far. In general, good agreement is found between our calculations
(based on the finite difference time domain method) and the experimental
results on localized resonances, even though no free fitting parameters were
used in describing the materials. It is found that SH emission is strongly
modulated by enhanced fields at the fundamental wavelength (either localized or
surface plasmon modes) on the glass metal interface. This is so in the
transmission side but also in reflection, where emission can only be explained
by an efficient tunneling of SH photons through the holes from the output to
the input side. Finally, the existence of a dark SPP at the fundamental field
is identified through a noninvasive method for the first time, by analyzing the
efficiency and far-field pattern distribution in transmission at the second
harmonic.

To facilitate concept search, different types of human-generated metadata have
been created to define the content of scientific and technical disclosures.
Classification schemes such as the International Patent Classification (IPC)
and MEDLINE's MeSH are structured and controlled, but require trained experts
and central management to restrict ambiguity (Mork, 2013). While unstructured
tags of folksonomies can be processed to produce a degree of structure
(Kalendar, 2010; Karampinas, 2012; Sarasua, 2012; Bragg, 2013) the freedom
enjoyed by the crowd typically results in less precision (Stock 2007).
  Existing classification schemes suffer from inflexibility and ambiguity.
Since humans understand language, inference, implication, abstraction and hence
concepts better than computers, we propose to harness the collective wisdom of
the crowd. To do so, we propose a novel classification scheme that is
sufficiently intuitive for the crowd to use, yet powerful enough to facilitate
search by analogy, and flexible enough to deal with ambiguity. The system will
enhance existing classification information. Linking up with the semantic web
and computer intelligence, a Citizen Science effort (Good, 2013) would support
innovation by improving the quality of granted patents, reducing duplicitous
research, and stimulating problem-oriented solution design.
  A prototype of our design is in preparation. A crowd-sourced fuzzy and

calculating the effective population size in two different ways. Under standard

thirty fold difference. We propose that this discrepancy is caused by the
subdivision of the species into a hundred or more ecotypes which are maintained
stably in the population. To investigate the genetic factors involved, we used
51 unrelated isolates to conduct a genome-wide scan for epistatically

formation and regulated by c-di-GMP signaling. All strains had one or other of

respect to the polar axis has been considered. The illumination model has been
used to evaluate the irradiation non-uniformity assuming circular and
elliptical super-gaussian laser intensity profiles and the irradiation scheme
has been optimized by means of the Polar Direct Drive technique. A parametric
study has been performed providing the irradiation non-uniformity as a function
of the Polar Direct Drive displacement and of the laser intensity profile
parameters. Moreover, two-dimensional axis-symmetric hydrodynamic simulations
have been performed for a plastic sphere irradiated by laser beams
characterized by a constant flat temporal power pulse. In these simulations the
front of the inward shock wave has been tracked providing the time-evolution of
any non-uniformity. The results provided by the two methods - illumination
model and hydrodynamic data - have been compared and it is found that the
illumination model reproduces the main behaviour exhibited by the hydrodynamic
data. The two models provide compatible values for the optimum Polar Direct
Drive parameter and similar optimal super-gaussian profiles.

Regular iron was found to occupy two different positions in proportion 2:1.
They differ by the electric quadrupole coupling constants and both of them
exhibit extremely anisotropic electric field gradient tensor (EFG) with the
asymmetry parameter equal one. The negative component of both EFGs is aligned
with the c-axis of the hexagonal unit cell, while the positive component is
aligned with the <120> direction. Hence, a model describing deviation from the
NiAs P63/mmc symmetry group within Fe-planes has been proposed. Spectra in the
magnetically ordered state could be explained by introduction of the
incommensurate spin spirals propagating through the iron atoms in the direction
of the c-axis with a complex pattern of the hyperfine magnetic fields
distributed within a-b plane. Hyperfine magnetic field pattern of spirals due
to major regular iron is smoothed by the spin polarized itinerant electrons,
while the minor regular iron exhibits hyperfine field pattern characteristic of
the highly covalent bonds to the adjacent antimony atoms. The excess
interstitial iron orders magnetically at the same temperature as the regular
iron, and magnetic moments of these atoms are likely to form two-dimensional
spin glass with moments lying in the a-b plane. The upturn of the hyperfine
field for minor regular iron and interstitial iron is observed below 80 K.
Magneto-elastic effects are smaller than for FeAs, however the recoilless
fraction increases significantly upon transition to the magnetically ordered

the future mobility.
  Objective: Miniature vehicles can bridge the gap between simulation-based
evaluations of algorithms relying on simplified models, and those
time-consuming vehicle tests on real-scale proving grounds.
  Method: This article combines findings from a systematic literature review,
an in-depth analysis of results and technical concepts from contestants in a
competition for self-driving miniature cars, and experiences of participating
in the 2013 competition for self-driving cars.
  Results: A simulation-based development platform for real-scale vehicles has
been adapted to support the development of a self-driving miniature car.
Furthermore, a standardized platform was designed and realized to enable
research and experiments in the context of future mobility solutions.
  Conclusion: A clear separation between algorithm conceptualization and
validation in a model-based simulation environment enabled efficient and
riskless experiments and validation. The design of a reusable, low-cost, and
energy-efficient hardware architecture utilizing a standardized
software/hardware interface enables experiments, which would otherwise require
resources like a large real-scale test track.

galaxy with the CanariCam on the Gran Telescopio Canarias with a spatial
resolution of 0.4--0.5$^{\prime\prime}$. In the K' band image the two nuclei of
the galaxy each show a double-peak suggesting the complex geometry of the
source, while the L', M', and Si-2 band images show single compact structures
in each of the two nuclei. Assuming that the center core observed at
wavelengths longer than 3.8$\mu$m is associated with dust heated by the buried
AGN, we re-evaluated the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of the southern
nucleus from 2 to 30$\mu$m with the additional literature values, and performed
the SED+spectroscopy fitting using the clumpy torus models of Nenkova et al.
(2008) and a Bayesian fitting approach. The model fit suggests that the high
covering factor torus emission in the southern nucleus is also obscured by
foreground dust in the host galaxy. The estimated AGN bolometric luminosity of
the southern nucleus, $L_{\rm bol}({\rm AGN})\sim1\times10^{45}$
[erg$\cdot$s$^{-1}$], accounts for approximately 40% of the whole luminosity of
the system.

large-scale surveys based on the variability pattern in their light curves. The
method is based on the Abbe value, that estimates the smoothness of a light
curve, and on a newly introduced value called the excess Abbe that estimates
the regularity of the light curve variability pattern over the duration of the
observations. Based on simulated light curves, transients are shown to occupy a
specific region in the Abbe versus Excess Abbe diagram, distinct from sources
presenting pulsating-like features in their light curves or having featureless
light curves.
  The method is tested on real light curves taken from EROS-2 and OGLE-II
surveys in a 0.50deg x 0.17deg field of the sky in the LMC. The method
identifies 43 EROS-2 transient candidates out of a total of ~1300 variable
stars, and 19 more OGLE-II candidates. The efficiency of the method is further
tested by comparing the list of transient candidates with known Be stars in the
literature. It is shown that all Be stars known in the studied field of view
with detectable bursts or outbursts are successfully extracted by the method.
In addition, four new transient candidates displaying bursts and/or outbursts
are found in the field, of which at least two are good new Be candidates.
  The new method proves to be a potentially powerful tool to extract transient
candidates from large-scale multi-epoch surveys. The better the photometric
measurement uncertainties are, the cleaner the list of detected transient
candidates is. In addition, the diagram is shown to be a good diagnostic tool
to check the data quality of multi-epoch photometric surveys. A trend of
instrumental and/or data reduction origin, for example, will manifest itself by
an unexpected distribution of points in the diagram.

This prompts the question, if stimulated emission can be observed in the

passed. We find that the stimulated photons essentially overlap with the
stimulating pulse. To overcome this problem, we identify the reduction of the
delayed scattered light intensity as alternative signature for the stimulated

  Reordering-Free Load-Balanced Switching",,,,,"cs.NI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Internet traffic continues to grow exponentially, calling for switches that
can scale well in both size and speed. While load-balanced switches can achieve
such scalability, they suffer from a fundamental packet reordering problem.
Existing proposals either suffer from poor worst-case packet delays or require
sophisticated matching mechanisms. In this paper, we propose a new family of
stable load-balanced switches called ""Sprinklers"" that has comparable
implementation cost and performance as the baseline load-balanced switch, but
yet can guarantee packet ordering. The main idea is to force all packets within
the same virtual output queue (VOQ) to traverse the same ""fat path"" through the
switch, so that packet reordering cannot occur. At the core of Sprinklers are
two key innovations: a randomized way to determine the ""fat path"" for each VOQ,
and a way to determine its ""fatness"" roughly in proportion to the rate of the
VOQ. These innovations enable Sprinklers to achieve near-perfect load-balancing
under arbitrary admissible traffic. Proving this property rigorously using
novel worst-case large deviation techniques is another key contribution of this
work.

another without central control. In natural systems, insects, birds, fish and
other large mammals function in larger units to increase the overall fitness of
the individuals. Their behavior is coordinated through local interactions to
enhance mate selection, predator detection, migratory route identification and
so forth [Andersson and Wallander 2003; Buhl et al. 2006; Nagy et al. 2010;
Partridge 1982; Sumpter et al. 2008]. In artificial systems, swarms of
autonomous agents can augment human activities such as search and rescue, and
environmental monitoring by covering large areas with multiple nodes [Alami et
al. 2007; Caruso et al. 2008; Ogren et al. 2004; Paley et al. 2007; Sibley et
al. 2002]. In this paper, we explore the interplay between swarm dynamics,
covert leadership and theoretical information transfer. A leader is a member of
the swarm that acts upon information in addition to what is provided by local
interactions. Depending upon the leadership model, leaders can use their
external information either all the time or in response to local conditions
[Couzin et al. 2005; Sun et al. 2013]. A covert leader is a leader that is
treated no differently than others in the swarm, so leaders and followers
participate equally in whatever interaction model is used [Rossi et al. 2007].
In this study, we use theoretical information transfer as a means of analyzing
swarm interactions to explore whether or not it is possible to distinguish
between followers and leaders based on interactions within the swarm. We find
that covert leaders can be distinguished from followers in a swarm because they
receive less transfer entropy than followers.

the environment, and path-planning based on the destination and barriers in the
environment. Such a process is computationally intensive. Moreover, as the
network scales up, the computational load increases quadratically, or even
exponentially. Unlike these man-made systems, most biological systems scale
linearly in complexity. Furthermore, the scale of a biological swarm can even
enable collective intelligence. One example comes from observations of golden
shiner fish. Golden shiners naturally prefer darkness and school together. Each
individual golden shiner does not know where the darkness is. Neither does it
sense the light gradients in the environment. However, by moving together as a
school, they always end up in the shady area. We apply such collective
intelligence learned from golden shiner fish to navigating robot swarms. Each
individual robot's dynamic is based on the gold shiners' movement strategy---a
random walk with its speed modulated by the light intensity and its direction
affected by its neighbors. The theoretical analysis and simulation results show
that our method 1) promises to navigate a robot swarm with little situational
knowledge, 2) simplifies control and decision-making for each individual robot,
3) requires minimal or even no information exchange within the swarm, and 4) is
highly distributed, adaptive, and robust.

algorithms are coupled, the diffusion-based implementation of each LMS
algorithm is exclusively undertaken by the nodes of the network interested in a
specific set of local or global parameters. To illustrate the effectiveness of
the proposed technique we provide simulation results in the context of
cooperative spectrum sensing in cognitive radio networks.

(AGES). Our observations cover a region spanning 5x4 degrees, over a redshift
range of approximately -2,000 < cz < 20,000 km/s. A total of 334 objects are
detected, mostly in three overdensities at cz $\sim$7,500, cz $\sim$9,600 and
cz $\sim$ 11,400 km/s. The galaxy density is extremely high (15 per square
degree) and many ($\sim$24%) show signs of extended HI emission, including some
features as much as 800 kpc in projected length. We describe the overall
characteristics of this environment : kinematics, typical galaxy colours and
mass to light ratios, and substructure. To aid in the cataloguing of this data
set, we present a new FITS viewer (FRELLED : Fits Realtime Explorer of Low
Latency in Every Dimension). This incorporates interactive source cataloguing
tools which increase our source extraction speed by approximately a factor of
50.

suggesting that they may not fulfill democratic ideals. Instead, peer
production projects may conform to Robert Michels' ""iron law of oligarchy,""

oligarchic as they grow. Using exhaustive data of internal processes from a
sample of 683 wikis, we construct empirical measures of participation and test
for increases in oligarchy associated with growth. In contrast to previous

dominance relationships in a group of rhesus macaques (a species of monkey)
using only position data captured using RFID tags. Automatic inference of the
social structure in an animal group enables a number of important capabilities,
including: 1) A verifiable measure of how the social structure is affected by
an intervention such as a change in the environment, or the introduction of
another animal, and 2) A potentially significant reduction in person hours
normally used for assessing these changes. Social structure in a group is an
important indicator of its members' relative level of access to resources and
has interesting implications for an individual's health and learning in groups.
There are two main quantitative criteria assessed in order to infer the social
structure; Time spent close to conspecifics, and displacements. An interaction
matrix is used to represent the total duration of events detected as grooming
behavior between any two monkeys. This forms an undirected tie-strength
(closeness of relationships) graph. A directed graph of hierarchy is
constructed by using the well cited assumption of a linear hierarchy for rhesus
macaques. Events that contribute to the adjacency matrix for this graph are
withdrawals or displacements where a lower ranked monkey moves away from a
higher ranked monkey. Displacements are one of the observable behaviors that
can act as a strong indication of tie-strength and dominance. To quantify the
directedness of interaction during these events we construct histograms of the
dot products of motion orientation and relative position. This gives us a
measure of how much time a monkey spends in moving towards or away from other
group members.

Namely, we perform a preferential attachment growth process to generate a

denote the degree of a node, and $N$ the number of nodes in the network. The
degree distribution is assumed to converge to a power-law (for $k\geq m$) of
the form $k^{-\gamma}$ and we obtain an exact implicit relationship for
$\gamma$, $m$ and $N$. We verify this with numerical calculations over several
orders of magnitude. Although this expression is exact, it provides only an
implicit expression for $\gamma(m)$. Nonetheless, we provide a reasonable guess
as to the form of this curve and perform curve fitting to estimate the
parameters of that curve --- demonstrating excellent agreement between
numerical fit, theory, and simulation.

phenomenological reconstruction of systems from raw data. In order to face the
problem, the use of sound features to reason on the system from data processing
is a key step. In the specific case of complex societal systems, sentiment
analysis allows to mirror (part of) the affective dimension. However it is not
reasonable to think that individual sentiment categorization can encompass the
new affective phenomena in digital social networks.
  The present papers addresses the problem of isolating sentiment concepts
which emerge in social networks. In an analogy to Artificial Intelligent
Singularity, we propose the study and analysis of these new complex sentiment
structures and how they are similar to or diverge from classic conceptual
structures associated to sentiment lexicons. The conjecture is that it is
highly probable that hypercomplex sentiment structures -not explained with
human categorizations- emerge from high dynamic social information networks.
Roughly speaking, new sentiment can emerge from the new global nervous systems
as it occurs in humans.

environments where the content of work artifacts, and the actions taken on
these artifacts, are fully visible to organizational members. Our qualitative
study of a community of open source software developers revealed a coordination
system characterized by interest-based, asynchronous interaction and knowledge
transfer. At the core of asynchronous knowledge transfer, lies the concept of
quasi-codification, which occurs when rich process knowledge is implicitly
encoded in work artifacts. Our findings suggest that members are able to more
selectively form dependencies, monitor the trajectory of projects, and make
their work understandable to others which facilitates coordination. We discuss
two important characteristics that enable coordination activities in a
transparent environment: the presence of an imagined audience that dictates the
way artifacts are crafted, and experience within the environment, that allows
individuals to derive knowledge from these artifacts. By showing how
transparency influences coordination, this research challenges previous
conceptions of coordination for complex, collaborative work.

modeling of equilibrium configurations for nematic liquid crystals in the
presence of internal and external electric fields. The method targets
minimization of system free energy based on the electrically and
flexoelectrically augmented Frank-Oseen free energy models. The Hessian,
resulting from the linearization of the first-order optimality conditions, is
shown to be invertible for both models when discretized by a mixed
finite-element method under certain assumptions. This implies that the
intermediate discrete linearizations are well-posed. A coupled multigrid solver
with Vanka-type relaxation is proposed and numerically vetted for approximation
of the solution to the linear systems arising in the linearizations. Two
electric model numerical experiments are performed with the proposed iterative
solver. The first compares the algorithm's solution of a classical Freedericksz
transition problem to the known analytical solution and demonstrates the
convergence of the algorithm to the true solution. The second experiment
targets a problem with more complicated boundary conditions, simulating a
nano-patterned surface. In addition, numerical simulations incorporating these
nano-patterned boundaries for a flexoelectric model are run with the iterative
solver. These simulations verify expected physical behavior predicted by a
perturbation model. The algorithm accurately handles heterogeneous coefficients
and efficiently resolves configurations resulting from classical and
complicated boundary conditions relevant in ongoing research.
