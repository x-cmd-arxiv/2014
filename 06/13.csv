implication for space weather and planetary life. The coronal mass ejections
(CMEs) come from the Sun and expand in the heliosphere, becoming interplanetary
coronal mass ejections (ICMEs). They represent huge clouds of plasma and
magnetic fields that travel with velocities reaching even 2000 km/s and
perturbing the planetary and interplanetary field. The magnetic clouds (MC) are
a special class of ICMEs. We summarize some aspects as the ICMEs
identification, propagation and track back to the Sun, where the solar source
could be found. We notice here few known catalogs of the ICMEs and magnetic
clouds.

impurity model. Within the RPT framework exact results for physical observables
such as the spin and charge susceptibility can be obtained in terms of the
renormalized values $\tilde{\boldsymbol\mu} = (\tilde{\Delta}, \tilde{U})$ of
the hybridization $\Delta$ and Coulomb interaction $U$ of the model. The main
difficulty in the RPT approach usually lies in the calculation of the
renormalized values themselves. In the present work we show how this can be
accomplished by deriving differential flow equations describing the evolution
of $\tilde{\boldsymbol \mu} (\Delta)$ with $\Delta$. By exploiting the fact
that $\tilde{\boldsymbol \mu} (\Delta)$ can be determined analytically in the
limit $\Delta \rightarrow \infty$ we solve the flow equations numerically to
obtain estimates for the renormalized parameters in the range
$0<U/\pi\Delta<3.5$.

$n$-bidder auction with additive valuation to $k$-item $1$-bidder auctions.
This approach, called the \emph{Best-Guess} reduction, can be applied to
address several central questions in optimal revenue auction theory such as the
power of randomization, and Bayesian versus dominant-strategy implementations.
First, when the items have independent valuation distributions, we present a
deterministic mechanism called {\it Deterministic Best-Guess} that yields at
least a constant fraction of the optimal revenue by any randomized mechanism.
Second, if all the $nk$ valuation random variables are independent, the optimal
revenue achievable in {\it dominant strategy incentive compatibility} (DSIC) is
shown to be at least a constant fraction of that achievable in {\it Bayesian
incentive compatibility} (BIC). Third, when all the $nk$ values are identically
distributed according to a common one-dimensional distribution $F$, the optimal
revenue is shown to be expressible in the closed form $\Theta(k(r+\int_0^{mr}
(1-F(x)^n) \ud x))$ where $r= sup_{x\geq 0} \, x(1 - F(x)^n)$ and $m=\lceil
k/n\rceil$; this revenue is achievable by a simple mechanism called
\emph{2nd-Price Bundling}. All our results apply to arbitrary distributions,
regular or irregular.

(a generalisation of the idea that no probabilistic interference remains
unaccounted for once we have taken into account interference between pairs of

or Consistent Exclusivity (that, if each pair of a set of experimental outcomes
are exclusive alternatives in some measurement, then their probabilities are
consistent with the existence of a further measurement in which they are all
exclusive). This is a step towards a more unified understanding of quantum
nonlocality and contextuality, which promises to allow derivations of important

implies that lack of third order interference bounds violation of the CHSH-Bell

swarms of insects or animals. Several algorithms arising from such models have
been proposed to solve a wide range of complex optimization problems. In this
paper, a novel swarm algorithm called the Social Spider Optimization (SSO) is
proposed for solving optimization tasks. The SSO algorithm is based on the
simulation of cooperative behavior of social-spiders. In the proposed
algorithm, individuals emulate a group of spiders which interact to each other
based on the biological laws of the cooperative colony. The algorithm considers
two different search agents (spiders): males and females. Depending on gender,
each individual is conducted by a set of different evolutionary operators which
mimic different cooperative behaviors that are typically found in the colony.
In order to illustrate the proficiency and robustness of the proposed approach,
it is compared to other well-known evolutionary methods. The comparison
examines several standard benchmark functions that are commonly considered
within the literature of evolutionary algorithms. The outcome shows a high
performance of the proposed method for searching a global optimum with several
benchmark functions.

performance even in brief presentations and under changes to object exemplar,
geometric transformations, and background variation (a.k.a. core visual object

formed in inferior temporal (IT) cortex. In parallel, recent advances in
machine learning have led to ever higher performing models of object
recognition using artificial deep neural networks (DNNs). It remains unclear,
however, whether the representational performance of DNNs rivals that of the
brain. To accurately produce such a comparison, a major difficulty has been a
unifying metric that accounts for experimental limitations such as the amount
of noise, the number of neural recording sites, and the number trials, and
computational limitations such as the complexity of the decoding classifier and
the number of classifier training examples. In this work we perform a direct
comparison that corrects for these experimental limitations and computational
considerations. As part of our methodology, we propose an extension of ""kernel
analysis"" that measures the generalization accuracy as a function of
representational complexity. Our evaluations show that, unlike previous
bio-inspired models, the latest DNNs rival the representational performance of
IT cortex on this visual object recognition task. Furthermore, we show that
models that perform well on measures of representational performance also
perform well on measures of representational similarity to IT and on measures
of predicting individual IT multi-unit responses. Whether these DNNs rely on
computational mechanisms similar to the primate visual system is yet to be
determined, but, unlike all previous bio-inspired models, that possibility
cannot be ruled out merely on representational performance grounds.

structure of the Higgs sector remains unknown. We discuss how it can be
determined by the combination of direct and indirect searches for additional
Higgs bosons at future collider experiments. First of all, we evaluate expected
excluded regions for the mass of additional neutral Higgs bosons from direct
searches at the LHC with the 14 TeV collision energy in the two Higgs doublet
models with a softly-broken $Z_2$ symmetry. Second, precision measurements of
the Higgs boson couplings at future experiments can be used for the indirect
search of extended Higgs sectors if measured coupling constant with the gauge
boson slightly deviates from the standard model value. In particular, in the
two Higgs doublet model with the softly-broken discrete symmetry, there are
four types of Yukawa interactions, so that they can be discriminated by
measuring the pattern of deviations in Yukawa coupling constants. Furthermore,
we can fingerprint various extended Higgs sectors with future precision data by
detecting the pattern of deviations in the coupling constants of the
standard-model-like Higgs boson. We demonstrate how the pattern of deviations
can be different among various Higgs sectors which predict the electroweak rho
parameter to be unity; such as models with additional an isospin singlet, a
doublet, triplets or a septet. We conclude that as long as the gauge coupling
constant of the Higgs boson slightly differs from the standard model prediction
but is enough to be detected at the LHC and its high-luminosity run or at the
International Linear Collider, we can identify the non-minimal Higgs sector
even without direct discovery of additional Higgs bosons at the LHC.

online sensor planning to monitor a spatial phenomenon in which the spatial

value function is derived from the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence and
represents the information value brought by sensor decision. The sensor
decision at every time step is to select the sensing location that maximizes
the information value function associated with the measurement taken. Gaussian
processes (GPs) are employed to obtain the posterior distribution of the
spatial phenomenon given a number of sensor measurements, because GPs have
sufficient flexibilities to adopt the complexity from data. Furthermore, a
greedy algorithm is designed based on the information value function. By
comparing the greedy algorithm with the random algorithm, it is shown that the

$\mathcal{H^\dagger}=\eta \mathcal{H} \eta^{-1}$. For the Hermitian Hamiltonian
$h$, one can write $h=\rho \mathcal{H} \rho^{-1}$ where $\rho=\sqrt{\eta}$ is

through the density of an individual particle and the ratio of its material

observations, and are proposed to explain observed featureless transit spectra.
However, it is difficult to make inferences from these data because of the need
to disentangle effects of gas absorption from haze extinction. Here, we turn to
the quintessential hazy world -- Titan -- to clarify how high altitude hazes
influence transit spectra. We use solar occultation observations of Titan's
atmosphere from the Visual and Infrared Mapping Spectrometer (VIMS) aboard
NASA's Cassini spacecraft to generate transit spectra. Data span 0.88-5 microns
at a resolution of 12-18 nm, with uncertainties typically smaller than 1%. Our
approach exploits symmetry between occultations and transits, producing transit
radius spectra that inherently include the effects of haze multiple scattering,
refraction, and gas absorption. We use a simple model of haze extinction to
explore how Titan's haze affects its transit spectrum. Our spectra show strong
methane absorption features, and weaker features due to other gases. Most
importantly, the data demonstrate that high altitude hazes can severely limit
the atmospheric depths probed by transit spectra, bounding observations to
pressures smaller than 0.1-10 mbar, depending on wavelength. Unlike the usual
assumption made when modeling and interpreting transit observations of
potentially hazy worlds, the slope set by haze in our spectra is not flat, and
creates a variation in transit height whose magnitude is comparable to those
from the strongest gaseous absorption features. These findings have important
consequences for interpreting future exoplanet observations, including those
from NASA's James Webb Space Telescope.

considering the effect of overcrowding of nodes in the embedding space. The
branching process is suppressed if the newborn node is closer than a distance

competition for resources, limiting the density of individuals and therefore
the total population. This results in an exponential growth in the initial

collider in 2016. SuperKEKB is designed to deliver an instantaneous luminosity
$\mathcal{L}=8\times10^{35}\,\mathrm{cm}^{-2}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}$. The experiment
will therefore have to cope with a much larger machine background than its
predecessor Belle, in particular from events outside of the interaction region.
We present the concept of a track trigger, based on a neural network approach,
that is able to suppress a large fraction of this background by reconstructing
the $z$ (longitudinal) position of the event vertex within the latency of the
first level trigger. The trigger uses the hit information from the Central
Drift Chamber (CDC) of Belle II within narrow cones in polar and azimuthal
angle as well as in transverse momentum (""sectors""), and estimates the
$z$-vertex without explicit track reconstruction. The preprocessing for the
track trigger is based on the track information provided by the standard CDC
trigger. It takes input from the 2D track finder, adds information from the
stereo wires of the CDC, and finds the appropriate sectors in the CDC for each
track. Within the sector, the $z$-vertex is estimated by a specialized neural
network, with the drift times from the CDC as input and a continuous output
corresponding to the scaled $z$-vertex. The neural algorithm will be
implemented in programmable hardware. To this end a Virtex 7 FPGA board will be
used, which provides at present the most promising solution for a fully
parallelized implementation of neural networks or alternative multivariate
methods. A high speed interface for external memory will be integrated into the
platform, to be able to store the $\mathcal{O}(10^9)$ parameters required. The
contribution presents the results of our feasibility studies and discusses the
details of the envisaged hardware solution.

mechanical analogue of topological states bound to defects in electronic

samples, magnetic and photonic probes image their magnetic and dielectric
structure while sharp tips probe mechanical properties like surface topography,
friction or stiffness. Most of these observables, however, are accessible only
under limited circumstances. For instance, electronic properties are measurable
only on conducting samples while atomic-resolution force microscopy requires
careful preparation of samples in ultrahigh vacuum or liquid environments.
  Here we demonstrate a scanning probe imaging method that extends the range of
accessible quantities to label-free imaging of chemical species operating on
arbitrary samples - including insulating materials - under ambient conditions.
Moreover, it provides three-dimensional depth information, thus revealing
subsurface features. We achieve these results by recording nuclear magnetic
resonance signals from a sample surface with a recently introduced scanning
probe, a single nitrogen-vacancy center in diamond. We demonstrate NMR imaging
with 10 nm resolution and achieve chemically specific contrast by separating
fluorine from hydrogen rich regions.
  Our result opens the door to scanning probe imaging of the chemical
composition and atomic structure of arbitrary samples. A method with these

biological specimens down to the level of single macromolecules.

mechanism (DA), the classic Boston mechanism (BM), and a variant of the Boston
mechanism where students automatically skip exhausted schools, which we call
the adaptive Boston mechanism (ABM). Assuming truthful reporting, we compare
student welfare under these mechanisms both from a conceptual and from a
quantitative perspective: We first show that, BM rank dominates DA whenever
they are comparable; and via limit arguments and simulations we show that ABM
yields intermediate student welfare between BM and DA. Second, we perform
computational experiments with preference data from the high school match in
Mexico City. We find that student welfare (in terms of rank transitions) is
highest under BM, intermediate under ABM, and lowest under DA. BM, ABM, and DA
can thus be understood to form a hierarchy in terms of student welfare. In
contrast, in (Mennle and Seuken, 2017), we have found that the same mechanisms
also form a hierarchy in terms of incentives for truthtelling that points in
the opposite direction. A decision between them therefore involves an implicit
trade-off between incentives and student welfare.

power spectrum measurements that include only Gaussian errors exaggerate their
scientific impact. Non-linear evolution and finite volume effects are both
significant sources of non-Gaussian covariance that reduce the ability of power
spectrum measurements to constrain cosmological parameters. Using a halo model
formalism, we derive an intuitive understanding of the various contributions to
the covariance and show that our analytical treatment agrees with simulations.
This approach enables an approximate derivation of a joint likelihood for the
cluster number counts, the weak lensing power spectrum and the bispectrum. We
show that this likelihood is a good description of the ray-tracing simulation.
Since all of these observables are sensitive to the same finite volume effects
and contain information about the non-linear evolution, a combined analysis
recovers much of the ""lost"" information and obviates the non-Gaussian
covariance. For upcoming weak lensing surveys, we estimate that a joint
analysis of power spectrum, number counts and bispectrum will produce an
improvement of about $30-40\%$ in determinations of the matter density and the
scalar amplitude. This improvement is equivalent to doubling the survey area.

this paper, we study the long-term evolution of disc warp and precession for
discs with dimensionless thickness $H/r$ larger than their viscosity parameter
$\alpha$, such that bending waves can propagate and dominate the warp
evolution. For small warps, these discs undergo approximately rigid-body
precession. We derive analytical expressions for the warp/twist profiles of the
disc and the alignment timescale for a variety of models. Applying our results
to circumbinary discs, we find that these discs align with the orbital plane of
the binary on a timescale comparable to the global precession time of the disc,
and typically much smaller than its viscous timescale. We discuss the
implications of our finding for the observations of misaligned circumbinary
discs (such as KH 15D) and circumbinary planetary systems (such as Kepler-413);
these observed misalignments provide useful constraints on the uncertain
aspects of the disc warp theory. On the other hand, we find that circumstellar
discs can maintain large misalignments with respect to the plane of the binary
companion over their entire lifetime. We estimate that inclination angles
larger than $\sim 20^\circ$ can be maintained for typical disc parameters.
Overall, our results suggest that while highly misaligned circumstellar discs
in binaries are expected to be common, such misalignments should be rare for
circumbinary discs. These expectations are consistent with current observations
of protoplanetary discs and exoplanets in binaries, and can be tested with
future observations.

invasion rates determine individual payoffs that govern the process of strategy
change. The traditional version of the game is recovered if the payoffs for
each potential invasion stem from a single pairwise interaction. However, the
transformation of invasion rates to payoffs also allows the usage of larger
interaction ranges. In addition to the traditional pairwise interaction, we
therefore consider simultaneous interactions with all nearest neighbors, as
well as with all nearest and next-nearest neighbors, thus effectively going
from single pair to group interactions in games of cyclic dominance. We show
that differences in the interaction range affect not only the stationary
fractions of strategies, but also their relations of dominance. The transition
from pairwise to group interactions can thus decelerate and even revert the
direction of the invasion between the competing strategies. Like in
evolutionary social dilemmas, in games of cyclic dominance too the indirect
multipoint interactions that are due to group interactions hence play a pivotal
role. Our results indicate that, in addition to the invasion rates, the
interaction range is at least as important for the maintenance of biodiversity
among cyclically competing strategies.

infall, catalyzed by the large fraction of dwarf galaxies that fell in as part

virial radius, so the most distant dwarf galaxies in the Local Group are the
most likely to have experienced a recent major merger. We discuss the

off-nuclear galactic emission. In the off-nuclear diffuse emission we find
signatures of strong cold reflection, including high equivalent-width neutral
Fe lines. This Compton-scattered off-nuclear emission amounts to 18% of the
nuclear flux in the Fe line region, but becomes comparable to the nuclear
emission above 30 keV. The new analysis no longer supports a prominent
transmitted AGN component in the observed band. We find that the nuclear

where the intrinsic spectrum is a powerlaw of photon index $\Gamma = 2.2-2.4$,
the torus has an equatorial column density of $N_{\rm H} =
(6-10)\times10^{24}$cm$^{-2}$ and the intrinsic AGN $2-10$ keV luminosity is

short time-scale variability of Circinus at X-ray energies above 10 keV for the

(IGM) densities and relative velocities that are one to two orders of magnitude
lower than in galaxies showing ram pressure stripping. Our model evaluates ram
pressure induced kinematic terms in gas disks with constant inclination as well
as those with a warped geometry. Ram pressure perturbations are characterized
by kinematic modes of even order, m=0 and m=2, corresponding to a ram wind
perpendicular and parallel to the gas disk, respectively. Long-term
consequences of ram pressure, such as warped disks as well as uncertainties in
the disk geometry typically generate uneven modes (m=1 and m=3), that are
clearly distinguishable from the kinematic ram pressure terms. We have applied
our models to three nearby isolated galaxies, utilizing Markov Chain Monte

prominent Mg II emission and absorption in a P Cygni profile. We find no

The Mg II emission has a broader range of velocities than do the nebular
emission line profiles; the Mg II emission is redshifted with respect to
systemic by 100 to 200 km/s. When present, Lyman alpha is even more redshifted.
The reddest components of Mg II and Lyman alpha emission have tails to 500-600
km/s, implying a strong outflow. The lack of correlation in the Mg II and Lyman
alpha equivalent widths, the differing velocity profiles, and the high ratios
of Mg II to nebular line fluxes together suggest that the bulk of Mg II

heliocentric orbital elements that were formed when a single ""rubble pile""
asteroid failed to remain bound against an increasing rotation rate. Models
suggest that the pairs' progenitors gained the fast rotation due to the YORP
effect. Since it was shown that the spin axis vector can be aligned by the YORP
effect, such a behavior should be seen on asteroid pairs, if they were indeed
formed by the described mechanism. Alternatively, if the pairs were formed by a
collision, the spin axes should have a random direction and small or young
bodies might have a tumbling rotation.
  Here I apply the lightcurve inversion method on self-obtained photometric
data, in order to derive the rotation axis vectors and shape models of the
asteroid pairs 2110, 3749, 5026, 6070, 7343 and 44612. Three asteroids resulted
with polar-directed spin axes and three objects with ambiguous results. In
addition, the secondary member 44612 presents the same sense of rotation as its
primary member 2110, and its spin is not tumbling. Finally, I use a rotational
fission model, based on the assumption of an angular momentum conservation, and
match it to the measured spin, shape, and mass ratio parameters in order to
constrain the density of the primary members in the pairs. Using this method,
low density values that are expected from a ""rubble pile"" are derived. All
these results lead to the conclusion that the disruption of these asteroid
pairs was most likely the outcome of the YORP effect that spun-up ""rubble pile""
asteroids.

the two remaining systems, the X-ay luminosity threshold is close to the

textbooks and exams. However, because of time, cost, and scoring reliability
constraints associated with this format, CR questions are being increasingly
replaced by multiple-choice (MC) questions in formal exams. The integrated
testlet (IT) is a recently-developed question structure designed to provide a
proxy of the pedagogical advantages of CR questions while procedurally
functioning as set of MC questions. ITs utilize an answer-until-correct
response format that provides immediate confirmatory or corrective feedback,
and they thus allow not only for the granting of partial credit in cases of
initially incorrect reasoning, but furthermore the ability to build cumulative
question structures. Here, we report on a study that directly compares the
functionality of ITs and CR questions in introductory physics exams. To do
this, CR questions were converted to concept-equivalent ITs, and both sets of
questions were deployed in midterm and final exams. We find that both question
types provide adequate discrimination between stronger and weaker students,
with CR questions discriminating slightly better than the ITs. Meanwhile, an
analysis of inter-rater scoring of the CR questions raises serious concerns
about the reliability of the granting of partial credit when this traditional
assessment technique is used in a realistic (but non optimized) setting.
Furthermore, we show evidence that partial credit is granted in a valid manner
in the ITs. Thus, together with consideration of the vastly reduced costs of
administering IT-based examinations compared to CR-based examinations, our
findings indicate that ITs are viable replacements for CR questions in formal
examinations where it is desirable to both assess concept integration and to
reward partial knowledge, while efficiently scoring examinations.

incorporating the structures of selectin and integrin receptors into a
conceptual framework based on the theory of stochastic equations, which

catch-bonds at low forces and slip-bonds at high forces). Catch-bonds arise due
to force-induced remodeling of hydrogen bond networks, a finding that also
accounts for unbinding in structurally unrelated integrin-fibronectin and
actomyosin complexes. For the selectin family, remodeling of hydrogen bond
networks drives an allosteric transition resulting in the formation of maximum
number of hydrogen bonds determined only by the structure of the receptor and
is independent of the ligand. A similar transition allows us to predict the
increase in number of hydrogen bonds in a particular allosteric state of
$\alpha_5 \beta_1$ integrin-fibronectin complex, a conformation which is yet to
be crystallized. We also make a testable prediction that a single point
mutation (Tyr51Phe) in the ligand associated with selectin should dramatically
alter the nature of the catch-bond compared to the wild type. Our work suggests
that nature utilizes a ductile network of hydrogen bonds to engineer function
over a broad range of forces.

in count rate increases by orders of magnitude, sometimes limited by the

that the spectra during the tail of the bursts can be modeled with an absorbed
blackbody with temperature decreasing with flux. The bursts flux decays
followed a power-law of index 0.8-0.9. In the burst tail spectra, we detect a
~13 keV emission feature, similar to those reported in previous bursts from
this source as well as from other magnetars observed with the Rossi X-ray

averaging procedures are applied to the modelling of fracture in specimens with
various boundary types. Firstly, the nonlocal models are calibrated by fitting
load-displacement curves and dissipated energy profiles for direct tension to
the results of mesoscale analyses performed using a discrete model. These
analyses are set up so that the results are independent of boundaries. Then,
the models are applied to two-dimensional simulations of three-point bending

meso-scale simulations. As an alternative approach, elastoplasticity combined
with nonlocal or over-nonlocal damage is also included in the comparative

collected 7 minutes and 23 minutes after closest approach. The extracted

3.0 micron consistent in position, bandwidth, and shape with the presence of
water ice grains. Using Hapke's radiative transfer model, we characterize the
type of mixing (areal vs. intimate), relative abundance, grain size, and
spatial distribution of water ice and refractories. Our modeling suggests that
the dust, which dominates the innermost coma of Hartley 2 and is at a
temperature of 300K, is thermally and physically decoupled from the
fine-grained water ice particles, which are on the order of 1 micron in size.
The strong correlation between the water ice, dust, and CO2 spatial
distribution supports the concept that CO2 gas drags the water ice and dust
grains from the nucleus. Once in the coma, the water ice begins subliming while
the dust is in a constant outflow. The derived water ice scale-length is
compatible with the lifetimes expected for 1-micron pure water ice grains at 1
AU, if velocities are near 0.5 m/s. Such velocities, about three order of
magnitudes lower than the expansion velocities expected for isolated 1-micron
water ice particles [Hanner, 1981; Whipple, 1951], suggest that the observed

clusters. Above a critical density that is well below the density at which
non-active particles would crystallize, the system can organize into a drifting
quiescent or frozen state where the fluctuations are lost and large
crystallites form surrounded by a small density of individual particles.
Although all the particles are still moving, their paths form closed orbits.
The average transient time to organize into the quiescent state diverges as a
power law upon approaching the critical density from above. We compare our
results to the random organization observed for periodically sheared systems
that can undergo an absorbing transition from a fluctuating state to a
dynamical non-fluctuating state. In the random organization studies, the system
organizes to a state in which the particles no longer interact; in contrast, we
find that the randomly running active matter organizes to a strongly
interacting dynamically jammed state. We show that the transition to the frozen

examine the effects of adding a small number of pinned particles to the system

two models which modify General Relativity at very large distances, the
Cascading DGP and the dRGT massive gravity, and investigate their
phenomenological viability. We start with a general introduction to standard
cosmology and we introduce the late time acceleration problem and the
cosmological constant problem. We then provide a pedagogical introduction to
the DGP model, of which the Cascading DGP is an extension, and to the dRGT
massive gravity. Concerning the Cascading DGP, we show that the thin limit of
the 4D brane inside the (already thin) 5D brane is well defined, at least for
the class of configurations that we consider, and confirm that gravity is
regularized in these set-ups. We give a geometrical interpretation of the
presence of the critical tension, and comment on the difference between the
results in the literature and our results, which we support with a numerical
calculation. Regarding the dRGT massive gravity, we focus on the branch of
solutions in which the Vainshtein mechanism can occur. We determine
analytically the number and properties of local solutions which exist
asymptotically on large scales (but still below the gravitational Compton
wavelength), and of local (inner) solutions which exist on small scales. We
characterize exactly the properties of global solutions in every point of the
phase space, and characterize precisely in which regions the Vainshtein
mechanism takes place. We also provide numerical solutions which confirm our

$\eta$, or the ratio of the rate of potential energy creation to the total
rate-of-working on the ocean by microswimmers. The first is based on scaling
arguments and estimates $\eta$ in terms of the ratio between the typical
organism size, $a$, and an intrinsic length scale for the stratified flow,
$\ell = \left ( \nu \kappa / N^2 \right )^{1/4}$, where $\nu$ is the kinematic
viscosity, $\kappa$ the diffusivity, and $N$ the buoyancy frequency. In
particular, for small organisms in the relevant oceanic limit, $a / \ell \ll
1$, we predict the scaling $\eta \sim (a / \ell)^3$. The second estimate of
$\eta$ is formed by solving the full coupled flow-stratification problem by
modeling the swimmer as a regularized force dipole, and computing the
efficiency numerically. Our computational results, which are examined for all
ratios $a/\ell$, validate the scaling arguments in the limit $a / \ell \ll 1$

swimming and $\eta \approx 0.15 \left ( a / \ell \right )^3$ for horizontal

to model some epidemic processes over a network. For each dynamic process in
our framework, we can define a function that measures the quality of every
subset of nodes as a potential cluster (or community) with respect to this
process on a given network. This subset-quality function generalizes the
traditional conductance measure for graph partitioning. We partially justify
our choice of the quality function by showing that the classic Cheeger's

a spectral quantity of its Laplacian matrix, can be extended from the

metabolism, gene expression and cell division. Such metabolic oscillations in
synchronized cultures reflect single-cell oscillations, but the relationship
between the oscillations in single cells and synchronized cultures is poorly
understood. To understand this relationship and the coordination between
metabolism and cell division, we collected and analyzed DNA-content,
gene-expression and physiological data, at hundreds of time-points, from
cultures metabolically-synchronized at different growth rates, carbon sources
and biomass densities. The data enabled us to extend and generalize an
ensemble-average-over-phases (EAP) model that connects the population-average
gene-expression of asynchronous cultures to the gene-expression dynamics in the
single-cells comprising the cultures. The extended model explains the
carbon-source specific growth-rate responses of hundreds of genes. Our data
demonstrate that for a given growth rate, the frequency of metabolic cycling in
synchronized cultures increases with the biomass density. This observation
underscores the difference between metabolic cycling in synchronized cultures
and in single cells and suggests entraining of the single-cell cycle by a
quorum-sensing mechanism. Constant levels of residual glucose during the
metabolic cycling of synchronized cultures indicate that storage carbohydrates
are required to fuel not only the G1/S transition of the division cycle but
also the metabolic cycle. Despite the large variation in profiled conditions
and in the time-scale of their dynamics, most genes preserve invariant dynamics
of coordination with each other and with the rate of oxygen consumption.
Similarly, the G1/S transition always occurs at the beginning, middle or end of
the high oxygen consumption phases, analogous to observations in human and
drosophila cells.

baseball team's winning percentage knowing just their runs scored and allowed.
His original formula estimates a winning percentage of ${\rm RS}^2/({\rm
RS}^2+{\rm RA}^2)$, where ${\rm RS}$ stands for runs scored and ${\rm RA}$ for
runs allowed; later versions found better agreement with data by replacing the
exponent 2 with numbers near 1.83. Miller and his colleagues provided a
theoretical justification by modeling runs scored and allowed by independent
Weibull distributions. They showed that a single Weibull distribution did a
very good job of describing runs scored and allowed, and led to a predicted
won-loss percentage of $({\rm RS_{\rm obs}}-1/2)^\gamma / (({\rm RS_{\rm
obs}}-1/2)^\gamma + ({\rm RA_{\rm obs}}-1/2)^\gamma)$, where ${\rm RS_{\rm
obs}}$ and ${\rm RA_{\rm obs}}$ are the observed runs scored and allowed and
$\gamma$ is the shape parameter of the Weibull (typically close to 1.8). We
show a linear combination of Weibulls more accurately determines a team's run
production and increases the prediction accuracy of a team's winning percentage
by an average of about 25% (thus while the currently used variants of the
original predictor are accurate to about four games a season, the new
combination is accurate to about three). The new formula is more involved
computationally; however, it can be easily computed on a laptop in a matter of
minutes from publicly available season data. It performs as well (or slightly
better) than the related Pythagorean formulas in use, and has the additional
advantage of having a theoretical justification for its parameter values (and
not just an optimization of parameters to minimize prediction error).

grammars. Given an input string and a grammar, the parsing problem is to check
if the input string belongs to the language generated by the grammar. A closely
related problem of great importance is one where the input are a string ${\cal
I}$ and a grammar $G$ and the task is to produce a string ${\cal I}'$ that
belongs to the language generated by $G$ and the `distance' between ${\cal I}$
and ${\cal I}'$ is the smallest (from among all the strings in the language).
Specifically, if ${\cal I}$ is in the language generated by $G$, then the
output should be ${\cal I}$. Any parser that solves this version of the problem
is called an {\em error correcting parser}. In 1972 Aho and Peterson presented
a cubic time error correcting parser for context free grammars. Since then this
asymptotic time bound has not been improved under the (standard) assumption
that the grammar size is a constant. In this paper we present an error
correcting parser for context free grammars that runs in $O(T(n))$ time, where
$n$ is the length of the input string and $T(n)$ is the time needed to compute
the tropical product of two $n\times n$ matrices.
  In this paper we also present an $\frac{n}{M}$-approximation algorithm for
the {\em language edit distance problem} that has a run time of $O(Mn^\omega)$,
where $O(n^\omega)$ is the time taken to multiply two $n\times n$ matrices. To
the best of our knowledge, no approximation algorithms have been proposed for
error correcting parsing for general context free grammars.

  12, 8929-8953","10.1090/tran6669",,"math.FA math.CA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Functions preserving Loewner positivity when applied entrywise to positive
semidefinite matrices have been widely studied in the literature. Following the
work of Schoenberg [Duke Math. J. 9], Rudin [Duke Math. J. 26], and others, it
is well-known that functions preserving positivity for matrices of all
dimensions are absolutely monotonic (i.e., analytic with nonnegative Taylor
coefficients). In this paper, we study functions preserving positivity when
applied entrywise to sparse matrices, with zeros encoded by a graph $G$ or a
family of graphs $G_n$. Our results generalize Schoenberg and Rudin's results
to a modern setting, where functions are often applied entrywise to sparse
matrices in order to improve their properties (e.g. better conditioning). The
only such result known in the literature is for the complete graph $K_2$. We
provide the first such characterization result for a large family of
non-complete graphs. Specifically, we characterize functions preserving Loewner
positivity on matrices with zeros according to a tree. These functions are
multiplicatively midpoint-convex and super-additive. Leveraging the underlying
sparsity in matrices thus admits the use of functions which are not necessarily
analytic nor absolutely monotonic. We further show that analytic functions
preserving positivity on matrices with zeros according to trees can contain
arbitrarily long sequences of negative coefficients, thus obviating the need
for absolute monotonicity in a very strong sense. This result leads to the
question of exactly when absolute monotonicity is necessary when preserving
positivity for an arbitrary class of graphs. We then provide a stronger
condition in terms of the numerical range of all symmetric matrices, such that
functions satisfying this condition on matrices with zeros according to any
family of graphs with unbounded degrees are necessarily absolutely monotonic.

wavelength scale of pre-inflation fluctuations in the inflaton field, and the
curvature of the pre-inflation universe, as a function of the fraction of the
total initial energy density in the inflaton field as inflation begins. We
estimate that if the pre-inflation contribution to the current CMB dipole is
near the upper limit set by the {\it Planck} Collaboration then the current
constraints on $\Lambda$CDM cosmological parameters allow for the possibility
of a significantly open $\Omega_{i} \le 0.4$ pre-inflating universe for a broad
range of the fraction of the total energy in the inflaton field at the onset of
inflation. This limit to $\Omega_{i}$ is even smaller if a larger dark-flow

shows marked differences. This result is surprising as clusters are at mass
scales that are {\em a thousand times greater} than that at which structure
formation is suppressed. WDM clusters gain significantly more mass via smooth
accretion and contain fewer substructures than their CDM brethren. The higher
smooth mass accretion results in subhaloes which are physically more extended
and less dense. These fine-scale differences can be probed by strong
gravitational lensing. We find, unexpectedly, that WDM clusters have {\em
higher} lensing efficiencies than those in CDM cosmologies, contrary to the
naive expectation that WDM clusters should be less efficient due to the fewer
substructures they contain. Despite being less dense, the larger WDM subhaloes
are more likely to have larger lensing cross-sections than CDM ones.
Additionally, WDM subhaloes typically reside at larger distances, which
radially stretches the critical lines associated with strong gravitational
lensing, resulting in excess in the number of clusters with large radial
cross-sections at the $\sim2\sigma$ level. Though lensing profile for an
individual cluster vary significantly with the line-of-sight, the radial arc
distribution based on a sample of $\gtrsim100$ clusters may prove to be the

gamma-ray energy range. In this work we argue that there are strong theoretical
motivations for studying these signals in the framework of gravitino dark
matter decay and we perform a search for gamma-ray spectral lines from 100\,MeV
to 10\,GeV with Fermi-LAT data. In contrast to previous line searches at higher
energies, the sensitivity of the present search is dominated by systematic
uncertainties across most of the energy range considered. We estimate the size
of systematic effects by analysing the flux from a number of control regions,
and include the systematic uncertainties consistently in our fitting procedure.
We have not observed any significant signals and present model-independent
limits on gamma-ray line emission from decaying and annihilating dark matter.
We apply the former limits to the case of the gravitino, a well-known dark
matter candidate in supersymmetric scenarios. In particular, the $R$-parity
violating ""$\mu$ from $\nu$"" Supersymmetric Standard Model ($\mu\nu$SSM) is an
attractive scenario in which including right-handed neutrinos solves the $\mu$
problem of the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model while simultaneously
explaining the origin of neutrino masses. At the same time, the violation of
$R$-parity renders the gravitino unstable and subject to decay into a photon
and a neutrino. As a consequence of the limits on line emission, $\mu\nu$SSM
gravitinos with masses larger than about 5\,GeV, or lifetimes smaller than
about $10^{28}$\,s, are excluded at 95% confidence level as dark matter
candidates.

are mostly attributed to flows forced by buoyancy forces in electrically
conducting fluid layers. However, these large-scale fields may also be
controlled by tides, as previously suggested for the star $\tau$-boo, Mars or
the Early Moon. By simulating a small local patch of a rotating fluid,
\cite{Barker2014} have recently shown that tides can drive small-scale dynamos
by exciting a hydrodynamic instability, the so-called elliptical (or tidal)
instability. By performing global magnetohydrodynamic simulations of a rotating
spherical fluid body, we investigate if this instability can also drive the
observed large-scale magnetic fields. We are thus interested by the dynamo
threshold and the generated magnetic field in order to test if such a mechanism
is relevant for planets and stars. Rather than solving the problem in a
geometry deformed by tides, we consider a spherical fluid body and add a body
force to mimic the tidal deformation in the bulk of the fluid. This allows us
to use an efficient spectral code to solve the magnetohydrodynamic problem. We
first compare the hydrodynamic results with theoretical asymptotic results, and
numerical results obtained in a truely deformed ellipsoid, which confirms the
presence of the elliptical instability. We then perform magnetohydrodynamic
simulations, and investigate the dynamo capability of the flow. Kinematic and
self-consistent dynamos are finally simulated, showing that the elliptical
instability is capable of generating dipole dominated large-scale magnetic
field in global simulations of a fluid rotating sphere.

often encountered in single-cell biochemistry, it is expected that FCS time
correlation functions of a reaction-diffusion system can deviate from the
classic results of Elson and Magde. We first discuss this nonlinear effect for
reaction systems without diffusion. For nonlinear stochastic reaction-diffusion
systems here are no closed solutions; therefore, stochastic Monte-Carlo
simulations are carried out. We show that the deviation is small for a simple
bimolecular reaction; the most significant deviations occur when the number of
molecules is small and of the same order. Our results show that current linear
FCS theory could be adequate for measurements on biological systems that
contain many other sources of uncertainties. At the same time it provides a
framework for future measurements of nonlinear, fluctuating chemical reactions
with high-precision FCS. Extending Delbr\""uck-Gillespie's theory for stochastic
nonlinear reactions with rapidly stirring to reaction-diffusion systems
provides a mesoscopic model for chemical and biochemical reactions at
nanometric and mesoscopic level such as a single biological cell.

  metrics","13 pages, 11 figures",,,,"physics.data-an","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Classical metric and non-metric multidimensional scaling (MDS) variants are
widely known manifold learning (ML) methods which enable construction of low
dimensional representation (projections) of high dimensional data inputs.
However, their use is crucially limited to the cases when data are inherently
reducible to low dimensionality. In general, drawbacks and limitations of
these, as well as pure, MDS variants become more apparent when the exploration
(learning) is exposed to the structured data of high intrinsic dimension. As we
demonstrate on artificial and real-world datasets, the over-determination
problem can be solved by means of the hybrid and multi-component
discrete-continuous multi-modal optimization heuristics. Its remarkable feature
is, that projections onto 2D are constructed simultaneously with the data
categorization (classification) compensating in part for the loss of original
input information. We observed, that the optimization module integrated with ML
modeling, metric learning and categorization leads to a nontrivial mechanism
resulting in generation of patterns of categorical variables which can be
interpreted as a heuristic charting. The method provides visual information in
the form of non-convex clusters or separated regions. Furthermore, the ability
to categorize the surfaces into back and front parts of the analyzed 3D data
objects have been attained through self-organized structuring without
supervising.

al., Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 95}, 196801 (2005)] was recently generalized to
multiple quenches and arbitrary finite temperatures [Nghiem et al., Phys. Rev.
B {\bf 89}, 075118 (2014)] by using the full density matrix approach
[Weichselbaum et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 99}, 076402 (2007)]. In this paper,
we numerically implement this formalism to study the response of a quantum
impurity system to a general pulse and periodic driving which are approximated
by a sufficient number of quenches. We show how the NRG approximation affects
the trace of the projected density matrices and the continuity of the
time-evolution of a local observable. For the general pulse case, the local
observable in the long-time limit exhibits a dependence on the switch-on time,
the time interval between the first and last quenches, as well as on the pulse
shape. In particular, the long-time limit is improved for longer switch-on
times and smoother pulses. This lends support to our earlier suggestion that
the long-time limit of observables can be improved by replacing a sudden large
quench by a sequence of smaller ones acting over a finite time-interval: longer
switch-on times and smoother pulses, i.e., increased adiabaticity, favor
relaxation of the system to its correct thermodynamic long-time limit. For the
case of periodic driving, we compare the TDNRG results to exact analytic ones
for the non-interacting resonant level model, finding better agreement at short
to intermediate time scales in the case of smoother driving. Finally, we
demonstrate the validity of the multiple-quench TDNRG formalism for arbitrary
temperatures by studying the time-evolution of the occupation number in the
Anderson impurity model in response to a periodic switching of the local level
from the mixed valence to the Kondo regime at finite temperatures.

collective motions in quantum many-body systems are described as bosonic
excitations. In particular, the first two-phonon $\gamma$ vibrational
($2\gamma$) excitation in odd-$A$ nuclei was reported in 2006 and only a few
have been known. Quite recently, conspicuously enhanced $B(E2)$s feeding
$2\gamma$ states were observed in $^{105}$Nb and conjectured that their parent
states are candidates of $3\gamma$ states. In the present work, the model space
is enlarged from the present author's previous calculation for $^{103}$Nb. The
purpose is twofold: One is to see how the description of $2\gamma$ states is
improved, and the other is to examine the existence of collective $3\gamma$
states, and when they exist, study their collectivity through calculating
interband $B(E2)$s. The particle-vibration coupling model based on the cranking
model and the random-phase approximation is used to calculate the vibrational
states in rotating odd-$A$ nuclei. Interband $B(E2)$s are calculated by
adopting the method of the generalized intensity relation. The present
calculation reproduces the observed spectra of $0\gamma$ - $2\gamma$ states
well and gives collective $3\gamma$ states with enhanced $B(E2)$s to $2\gamma$
states in $^{103}$Nb and $^{105}$Nb. The most collective $3\gamma$ state with
the highest $K$ at zero rotation is thought to be the main component of the
observed band.

self-diffusion seems to get suppressed with any dopant of which heat of nitride
formation is significantly smaller than that of iron nitride. Importantly, it

feature of the ICM in cluster outskirts. We show that the average
hydrostatic-to-lensing total mass ratio for the four clusters decreases from
\sim 70% to \sim 40% as the overdensity contrast decreases from 500 to the
virial value.The average gas mass fraction from lensing total mass estimates
increases with cluster radius and agrees with the cosmic mean baryon fraction
within the virial radius, whereas the X-ray-based gas fraction considerably
exceeds the cosmic values due to underestimation of the hydrostatic mass. We
also develop a new advanced method for determining normalized cluster radial
profiles for multiple X-ray observables by simultaneously taking into account
both their radial dependence and multivariate scaling relations with
weak-lensing masses. Although the four clusters span a range of halo mass,
concentration, X-ray luminosity and redshift, we find that the gas entropy,
pressure, temperature and density profiles are all remarkably self-similar when
scaled with the lensing M_200 mass and r_200 radius.The entropy monotonically
increases out to \sim 0.5r_200 following the accretion shock heating model
K(r)\propto r^1.1, and flattens at \simgt 0.5r_200.The universality of the
scaled entropy profiles indicates that the thermalization mechanism over the
entire cluster region (>0.1r_200) is controlled by gravitation in a common to
all clusters, although the heating efficiency in the outskirts needs to be
modified from the standard law.The bivariate scaling functions of the gas
density and temperature reveal that the flattening of the outskirts entropy
profile is caused by the steepening of the temperature, rather than the
flattening of the gas density.

insight into its rich blue straggler population. Specifically, the NGC 188 blue
stragglers are characterized by: A binary frequency of 80% for orbital periods
less than $10^4$ days;Typical orbital periods around 1000 days;Typical
secondary star masses of 0.5 M$_{\odot}$; At least some white dwarf companion
stars; Modestly rapid rotation; A bimodal radial spatial distribution;
Dynamical masses greater than standard stellar evolution masses (based on
short-period binaries); Under-luminosity for dynamical masses (short-period
binaries). Extensive $N$-body modeling of NGC 188 with empirical initial
conditions reproduces the properties of the cluster, and in particular the
main-sequence solar-type binary population. The current models also reproduce
well the binary orbital properties of the blue stragglers, but fall well short
of producing the observed number of blue stragglers. This deficit could be
resolved by reducing the frequency of common-envelope evolution during Roche
lobe overflow. Both the observations and the $N$-body models strongly indicate
that the long-period blue-straggler binaries - which dominate the NGC 188 blue
straggler population - are formed by asymptotic-giant (primarily) and red-giant
mass transfer onto main sequence stars. The models suggest that the few
non-velocity-variable blue stragglers formed from mergers or collisions.
Several remarkable short-period double-lined binaries point to the importance
of subsequent dynamical exchange encounters, and provide at least one example
of a likely collisional origin for a blue straggler.

covers systems that most likely went through wind mass transfer: barium and

timescales (adiabatic response, equilibrium response, superadiabatic response,
time-dependent response) for different types of their envelopes (convective and

transfer. The predictions of the theory of mass transfer via Roche lobe

stellar collisions are likely to lead to relatively little mass loss and are
thus effective in producing a young population of more-massive stars. The
number of blue straggler stars produced by collisions will tend to increase
with cluster mass. We review how the current population of blue straggler stars
produced from primordial binaries decreases with increasing cluster mass. This
is because exchange encounters with third, single stars in the most massive
clusters tend to reduce the fraction of binaries containing a primary close to
the current turn-off mass. Rather, their primaries tend to be somewhat more
massive and have evolved off the main sequence, filling their Roche lobes in
the past, often converting their secondaries into blue straggler stars (but
more than 1 Gyr or so ago and thus they are no longer visible today as blue
straggler stars).

concurrency in applications have been proposed, such as the actor model,
Communicating Sequential Processes, and Software Transactional Memory. The
ubiquity of multi-core processors has made harnessing concurrency even more
important. We observe that modern languages, such as Scala, Clojure, or F#,
provide not one, but multiple concurrency models that help developers manage
concurrency. Large end-user applications are rarely built using just a single
concurrency model. Programmers need to manage a responsive UI, deal with file
or network I/O, asynchronous workflows, and shared resources. Different
concurrency models facilitate different requirements. This raises the issue of
how these concurrency models interact, and whether they are composable. After
all, combining different concurrency models may lead to subtle bugs or
inconsistencies.
  In this paper, we perform an in-depth study of the concurrency abstractions
provided by the Clojure language. We study all pairwise combinations of the
abstractions, noting which ones compose without issues, and which do not. We
make an attempt to abstract from the specifics of Clojure, identifying the
general properties of concurrency models that facilitate or hinder composition.

stragglers. Stellar collisions, binary mergers (or coalescence), and partial or
ongoing mass transfer have all been studied in some detail. The products of
stellar collisions retain memory of their parent stars and are not fully mixed.
Very high initial rotation rates must be reduced by an unknown process to allow
the stars to collapse to the main sequence. The more massive collision products
have shorter lifetimes than normal stars of the same mass, while products
between low mass stars are long-lived and look very much like normal stars of
their mass. Mass transfer can result in a merger, or can produce another binary
system with a blue straggler and the remnant of the original primary. The
products of binary mass transfer cover a larger portion of the colour-magnitude
diagram than collision products for two reasons: there are more possible
configurations which produce blue stragglers, and there are differing
contributions to the blended light of the system. The effects of rotation may
be substantial in both collision and merger products, and could result in
significant mixing unless angular momentum is lost shortly after the formation
event. Surface abundances may provide ways to distinguish between the formation
mechanisms, but care must be taking to model the various mixing mechanisms
properly before drawing strong conclusions. Avenues for future work are
outlined.

will touch on topics also discussed elsewhere in this book, such as the
discovery and implications of bimodal radial distributions and the ""double
sequences"" of blue stragglers that have recently been found in some clusters.
However, we will focus particularly on the search for a ""smoking gun""
correlation between the number of blue stragglers in a given globular cluster
and a physical cluster parameter that would point towards a particular
formation channel. As we shall see, there is little evidence for an intrinsic
correlation between blue straggler numbers and stellar collision rates, even in
dense cluster cores. On the other hand, there is a clear correlation between
blue straggler numbers and the total (core) mass of the cluster. This would
seem to point towards a formation channel involving binaries, rather than
dynamical encounters. However, the correlation between blue straggler numbers
and actual binary numbers - which relies on recently determined empirical
binary fractions - is actually weaker than that with core mass. We explain how
this surprising result may be reconciled with a binary formation channel if
binary fractions depend almost uniquely on core mass. If this is actually the
case, it would have significant implications for globular cluster dynamics more
generally.

theoretical concept of simple stellar populations (SSPs) in the Universe. SSPs
are widely used as the basic building blocks to interpret stellar contents in
galaxies. The concept of an SSP is a group of coeval stars which follows a
given distribution in mass, and has the same chemical property and age. In
practice, SSPs are more conveniently made by the latest stellar evolutionary
models of single stars. In reality, however, stars can be more complicated than
just single either at birth time or during the course of evolution in a typical
environment. Observations of star clusters show that there are always exotic
objects which do not follow the predictions of standard theory of stellar
evolution. Blue straggler stars (BSSs), as discussed intensively in this book
both observationally and theoretically, are very important in our context when
considering the integrated spectral properties of a cluster, or a simple
stellar population. In this chapter, we are going to describe how important the
contribution of BSSs is to the total light of a cluster.

multivariate and seasonal with spatial and temporal dimensions. The algorithm
What's Strange About Recent Events (WSARE) is the state-of-the-art method for
such problems. It exhaustively searches for contrast sets in the multivariate
data and signals an alarm when find statistically significant rules. This
bottom-up approach presents a much lower detection delay comparing the existing
top-down approaches. However, WSARE is very sensitive to the small-scale
changes and subsequently comes with a relatively high rate of false alarms. We
propose a new approach called EigenEvent that is neither fully top-down nor

changes in data correlation structure via eigenspace techniques. This new
methodology enables us to detect both overall changes (via eigenvalue) and
dimension-level changes (via eigenvectors). Experimental results on hundred

close to the Pareto ones. Differently from previous policy-gradient
multi-objective algorithms, where n optimization routines are use to have n

generates an improved continuous approximation of the Pareto frontier. The idea
is to exploit a gradient-based approach to optimize the parameters of a
function that defines a manifold in the policy parameter space so that the
corresponding image in the objective space gets as close as possible to the
Pareto frontier. Besides deriving how to compute and estimate such gradient, we
will also discuss the non-trivial issue of defining a metric to assess the
quality of the candidate Pareto frontiers. Finally, the properties of the
proposed approach are empirically evaluated on two interesting MOMDPs.

unexpected, with respect to the some baseline information. For instance, in
disease surveillance, the purpose is to detect sub-regions in spatiotemporal
space, where the count of reported diseases (e.g. Cancer) is higher than
expected, with respect to the population. The state-of-the-art method for this
kind of problem is the Space-Time Scan Statistics (STScan), which exhaustively
search the whole space through a sliding window looking for significant
spatiotemporal clusters. STScan makes some restrictive assumptions about the
distribution of data, the shape of the hotspots and the quality of data, which
can be unrealistic for some nontraditional data sources. A novel methodology
called EigenSpot is proposed where instead of an exhaustive search over the
space, tracks the changes in a space-time correlation structure. Not only does
the new approach presents much more computational efficiency, but also makes no
assumption about the data distribution, hotspot shape or the data quality. The
principal idea is that with the joint combination of abnormal elements in the
principal spatial and the temporal singular vectors, the location of hotspots
in the spatiotemporal space can be approximated. A comprehensive experimental
evaluation, both on simulated and real data sets reveals the effectiveness of
the proposed method.

Chemical rate equations are solved with the diffusion term, mimicking the
turbulent mixing in the vertical direction. Turbulence can bring ice-coated
dust grains from the midplane to the warm irradiated disk surface, and the ice
mantles are reprocessed by photoreactions, thermal desorption, and surface
reactions. The upward transport decreases the abundance of methanol and ammonia
ices at r < 30 AU, because warm dust temperature prohibits their reformation on
grain surfaces. This reprocessing could explain the smaller abundances of
carbon and nitrogen bearing molecules in cometary coma than those in low-mass
protostellar envelopes. We also show the effect of mixing on the synthesis of
complex organic molecules (COMs) are two ways: (1) transport of ices from the
midplane to the disk surface and (2) transport of atomic hydrogen from the
surface to the midplane. The former enhances the COMs formation in the disk
surface, while the latter suppresses it in the midplane. Then, when mixing is
strong, COMs are predominantly formed in the disk surface, while their parent
molecules are (re)formed in the midplane. This cycle expands the COMs
distribution both vertically and radially outward compared with that in the
non-turbulent model. We derive the timescale of the sink mechanism by which CO
and N2 are converted to less volatile molecules to be depleted from the gas
phase, and find that the vertical mixing suppresses this mechanism in the inner

Moreover it is possible to characterize those Hopf algebroids that arise in

  Recently, the notion of a weak Hopf algebra has been extended to the case of

algebras. Similarly also the theory of Hopf algebroids was recently developed
for algebras without identity. They are called multiplier Hopf algebroids. Then
it is quite natural to investigate the expected link between weak multiplier
Hopf algebras and multiplier Hopf algebroids. This relation has been considered
already in the original paper on multiplier Hopf algebroids. In this note, we
investigate the connection further.
  First we show that any regular weak multiplier Hopf algebra gives rise, in a
natural way, to a regular multiplier Hopf algebroid. Secondly we give a
characterization, mainly in terms of the base algebra, for a regular multiplier
Hopf algebroid to have an underlying weak multiplier Hopf algebra. We
illustrate this result with some examples. In particular, we give examples of

afterglow emission of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), while a short-lived,
supermassive neutron star (NS) forms during the GRBs. I investigate the
possible contributions to the dispersion measure (DM) of the FRBs from the GRB
ejecta and the wind blown from the precollapsing NS. On the one hand, sometimes
an internal X-ray plateau afterglow could be produced by the NS wind, which
indicates that a great number of electron-positron pairs are carried by the
wind. If the pair-generation radius satisfies a somewhat rigorous condition,
the relativistic and dense wind would contribute a high DM to the associated
FRB, which can be comparable to and even exceed the DM contributed by the
intergalactic medium. On the other hand, if the wind only carries a
Goldreich-Julian particle flux, its DM contribution would become negligible;
meanwhile, the internal plateau afterglow would not appear. Alternatively, the
FRB should be associated with a GRB afterglow produced by the GRB external
shock, i.e., an energy-injection-caused shallow-decay afterglow or a normal
single-power-law afterglow if the impulsive energy release of the GRB is high
enough. In the latter case, the DM contributed by the high-mass GRB ejecta
could be substantially important, in particular, for an environment of
main-sequence stellar wind. In summary, a careful assessment on the various DM
contributors could be required for the cosmological application of the expected
FRB-GRB association. The future DM measurements of GRB-associated FRBs could
provide a constraint on the physics of NS winds.

orthomodular lattices into Boolean algebras with one modal operator. Thus our
classical logic is a completion of the quantum logic QL. In other words, we
refute Birkhoff and von Neumann's classic thesis that the logic (the formal
character) of Quantum Mechanics would be non-classical as well as Putnam's
thesis that quantum logic (of his kind) would be the correct logic for
propositional inference in general. The propositional logic of Quantum
Mechanics is modal but classical, and the correct logic for propositional
inference need not have an extroverted quantum character. One normal necessity
modality suffices to capture the subjectivity of observation in quantum
experiments, and this thanks to its failure to distribute over classical
disjunction. The key to our result is the translation of quantum negation as
classical negation of observability.

antiferroelectric (AFE) transition in PbZr1-xTixO3 (x=0.054) can occur
separately and with different kinetics, depending on the sample history, and
are accompanied by elastic softening and stiffening, respectively. Together
with the softening that accompanies octahedral tilting in the fraction of phase
that is not yet transformed into AFE, they give rise to a variety of shapes of
the curves of the elastic compliance versus temperature. All such anomalies
found in samples with x=0.046 and 0.054, in addition to those already studied
at x=0.050, can be fitted consistently with a phenomenological model based on
the simple hypothesis that each of the polar and AFD transitions produces a
step in the elastic modulus, whose position in temperature and width reflect
the progress of each transition. The slowing of the kinetics of the
transformations is correlated with the formation of defect structures during
aging in the ferroelectric or AFE state, which are also responsible for a
progressive softening of the lattice with time and thermal cycling, until
annealing at high temperature recovers the initial conditions.

taking into account only the crossing of stocks and fixing a convention
defining overcrossings and undercrossings. The braid of stocks prices has a
remarkable connection with the topological quantum computer. Using pairs of
quasi-particles, called non-abelian anyons, having their trajectories braided
in time, topological quantum computer can effectively simulate the stock market
behavior encoded in the braiding of stocks. In a typically topological quantum
computation process the trajectories of non-abelian anyons are manipulated
according to the braiding of stocks and the outcome reflects the probability of
the future state of stock market. The probability depends only on the Jones
polynomial of the knot formed by plat closing the quantum computation. The
Jones polynomial of the knotted stock market acts, making a parallel with the
common financial literature, in a topological quantum computation as a
counterpart of a classical technical indicator in trading the stock market. The
type of knot stock market formed is an indicator of its future tendencies.

various micro-organisms. By continually consuming energy, they bypass the laws
of equilibrium thermodynamics. These laws enforce the Boltzmann distribution in
thermal equilibrium: the steady state is then independent of kinetic
parameters. In contrast, self-propelled particles tend to accumulate where they
move more slowly. They may also slow down at high density, for either
biochemical or steric reasons. This creates positive feedback which can lead to
motility-induced phase separation (MIPS) between dense and dilute fluid phases.
At leading order in gradients, a mapping relates variable-speed, self-propelled
particles to passive particles with attractions. This deep link to equilibrium
phase separation is confirmed by simulations, but generally breaks down at
higher order in gradients: new effects, with no equilibrium counterpart, then
emerge. We give a selective overview of the fast-developing field of MIPS,

states with complex frequencies. Some of these states decay in time, but some
others -- in the superradiant regime -- grow, causing a superradiant
instability. Precisely at the threshold between decaying and growing modes,
there exist bound states with real frequency, known as scalar clouds. Fully
non-linear counterparts of these clouds have been shown to yield Kerr black
holes with scalar hair. Here, we consider massive, (electrically) charged, test
scalar and Proca fields on the background of Reissner-Nordstr\""om black holes.
By computing the quasi-bound state frequencies, we establish that no such
states exist in the superradiant regime for the Proca field -- a similar
behavior to that known for scalar fields. But decaying quasi-bound states with
an arbitrarily small imaginary part of the frequency exist and thus which are
arbitrarily long lived. In the limit of vanishing imaginary part of the
frequency, the field does not trivialize and we dub the corresponding
configurations as marginal (charged) scalar or Proca clouds, since they are
only marginally bound. We comment on the possible existence of non-linear
counterparts to these marginal clouds.

$0.5<p_T<5.0$~GeV/$c$ and $3.0<|\eta|<3.8$ is well described by a
next-to-leading-order perturbative-quantum-chromodynamics calculation. The
asymmetries $A_N$ have been measured as a function of Feynman-$x$ ($x_F$) from
$0.2<|x_{F}|<0.7$, as well as transverse momentum ($p_T$) from
$1.0<p_T<4.5$~GeV/$c$. The asymmetry averaged over positive $x_F$ is
$\langle{A_{N}}\rangle=0.061{\pm}0.014$. The results are consistent with prior
transverse single-spin measurements of forward $\eta$ and $\pi^{0}$ mesons at
various energies in overlapping $x_F$ ranges. Comparison of different particle

higher spin (CHS) theory viewed as a collection of free spin s CFT's in R^d. We
discuss in detail the 4-dimensional case (where s=1 is the standard Maxwell
vector, s=2 is the Weyl graviton, etc.), but also present a generalization for
all even dimensions d. Z may be found by counting the numbers of conformal
operators and their descendants (modulo gauge identities and equations of
motion) weighted by scaling dimensions. This conformal operator counting method
requires a careful analysis of the structure of characters of relevant
(conserved current, shadow field and conformal Killing tensor) representations
of the conformal algebra so(d,2). There is also a close relation to massless
higher spin partition functions with alternative boundary conditions in
AdS_{d+1}. The same partition function Z may also be computed from the CHS path
integral on a curved S^1 x S^{d-1} background. This allows us to determine a
simple factorized form of the CHS kinetic operator on this conformally flat
background. Summing the individual conformal spin contributions Z_s over all
spins we obtain the total partition function of the CHS theory. We also find
the corresponding Casimir energy and show that it vanishes if one uses the same
regularization prescription that implies the cancellation of the total
conformal anomaly a-coefficient. This happens to be true in all even dimensions

string--theoretical $\alpha'$ corrections. Classically one has the relation
$\sigma = 4 G S$ between that absorption cross section and the black hole
entropy. By comparing in each case the values of the horizon area and Wald's
entropy, we discuss the validity of such relation in the presence of higher

the presence of electric and magnetic charges, for nonsupersymmetric and
supersymmetric black holes, in d=4 and d=5 dimensions. The examples we consider
seem to indicate that this relation is not verified in the presence of
$\alpha'$ corrections in general, although being valid in some specific cases
(electrically charged maximally supersymmetric black holes in d=5). We argue
that the relation $\sigma = 4 G S$ should in general be valid for the
absorption cross section of scalar fields which, although being independent
from the black hole solution, have their origin from string theory, and

  Fashion E-commerce",,,,,"cs.HC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Fashion, and especially apparel, is the fastest-growing category in online
shopping. As consumers requires sensory experience especially for apparel goods
for which their appearance matters most, images play a key role not only in
conveying crucial information that is hard to express in text, but also in
affecting consumer's attitude and emotion towards the product. However,
research related to e-commerce product image has mostly focused on quality at
perceptual level, but not the quality of content, and the way of presenting.
This study aims to address the effectiveness of types of image in showcasing
fashion apparel in terms of its attractiveness, i.e. the ability to draw
consumer's attention, interest, and in return their engagement. We apply
advanced vision technique to quantize attractiveness using three common display
types in fashion filed, i.e. human model, mannequin, and flat. We perform
two-stage study by starting with large scale behavior data from real online
market, then moving to well designed user experiment to further deepen our
understandings on consumer's reasoning logic behind the action. We propose a
Fisher noncentral hypergeometric distribution based user choice model to
quantitatively evaluate user's preference. Further, we investigate the
potentials to leverage visual impact for a better search that caters to user's
preference. A visual attractiveness based re-ranking model that incorporates
both presentation efficacy and user preference is proposed. We show

from a few minutes to few tens of minutes and their amplitudes were found to
decay rapidly as they travel along the supporting structure. Previously,
thermal conduction, compressive viscosity, radiation, density stratification,

slow wave amplitude. Our recent studies indicate that the observed damping in
these waves is frequency dependent. We used imaging data from SDO/AIA, to study
this dependence in detail and for the first time from observations we attempted
to deduce a quantitative relation between damping length and frequency of these
oscillations. We developed a new analysis method to obtain this relation. The
observed frequency dependence does not seem to agree with the current linear

a different dependence from those observed in the on-disk loop structures

all pedestrians have the same body size and speed. In this paper, a method
called fine grid cellular automata is proposed in which smaller cells are used

different body sizes, shapes and speeds for pedestrian.
  The proposed model is used for simulating movements of pedestrians toward a

high performance computing, its adoption in low-latency, real-time systems is

  Although GPUs typically show deterministic behaviour in terms of latency in

careful characterization of all subsystems along data stream path.
  The networking subsystem results in being the most critical one in terms of

Interface Card (NIC) design featuring a configurable and extensible set of
network channels with direct access through GPUDirect to NVIDIA Fermi/Kepler
GPU memories.
  NaNet design currently supports both standard - GbE (1000BASE-T) and 10GbE
(10Base-R) - and custom - 34~Gbps APElink and 2.5~Gbps deterministic latency
KM3link - channels, but its modularity allows for a straightforward inclusion
of other link technologies.
  To avoid host OS intervention on data stream and remove a possible source of
jitter, the design includes a network/transport layer offload module with
cycle-accurate, upper-bound latency, supporting UDP, KM3link Time Division

  After NaNet architecture description and its latency/bandwidth

condensation when they are conditioned to a large deviation of their sum. It is
well understood that the condensation, whereby one of the random variables

slower than exponential. Here we study a similar phenomenon in which
condensation is exhibited for non-heavy-tailed distributions, provided random

the additional constraint is the sample variance) and demonstrated in several

  Communication Using Simulated Atmospheric Conditions in Laboratory","13 pages, 11 figures",,,,"physics.ins-det","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","  We present a practical scheme for measurement-device-independent polarization
shift keying using two state polarization encoding. Most of the previous work
on optical free space laser communications through the atmosphere was
concentrated on intensity modulated systems. However, polarization modulated
systems may be more appropriate for such communication links, because the
polarization seems to be the most stable characteristic of a laser beam while
propagating through the atmosphere. Thus, a detailed comparison between
intensity and polarization modulated systems is of much interest. We analyse
the noise in presence of simulated smoke and fog conditions within laboratory
and propose a practical scheme for extracting message from the received data.
The proposed method uses only two detectors to analyse the polarizations and
the practical definition of state of polarization enables a higher
signal-to-noise ratio even in presence of depolaration elements in atmosphere
such as fog and smoke. The system also takes into account existing
imperfections within the experimental setup and hence is more robust.

topological superconductor-quantum dot-topological superconductor hybrid device
by charge transport measurements. The device is made from an epitaxially grown
InSb nanowire with two superconductor Nb contacts on a Si/SiO$_2$ substrate. At
low temperatures, a quantum dot is formed in the segment of the InSb nanowire
between the two Nb contacts and the two Nb contacted segments of the InSb
nanowire show superconductivity due to the proximity effect. At zero magnetic
field, well defined Coulomb diamonds and the Kondo effect are observed in the
charge stability diagram measurements in the Coulomb blockade regime of the
quantum dot. Under the application of a finite, sufficiently strong magnetic
field, a zero-bias conductance peak structure is observed in the same Coulomb
blockade regime. It is found that the zero-bias conductance peak is present in
many consecutive Coulomb diamonds, irrespective of the even-odd parity of the
quasi-particle occupation number in the quantum dot. In addition, we find that
the zero-bias conductance peak is in most cases accompanied by two differential
conductance peaks, forming a triple-peak structure, and the separation between
the two side peaks in bias voltage shows oscillations closely correlated to the
background Coulomb conductance oscillations of the device. The observed
zero-bias conductance peak and the associated triple-peak structure are in line
with the signatures of Majorana fermion physics in a nanowire based topological
superconductor-quantum dot-topological superconductor system, in which the two
Majorana bound states adjacent to the quantum dot are hybridized into a pair of
quasi-particle states with finite energies and the other two Majorana bound
states remain as the zero-energy modes located at the two ends of the entire
InSb nanowire.

reflecting the chemical conditions after the first supernova explosion. Here,
we present the first cosmological simulations with a detailed chemical network
including primordial species as well as C, C$^+$, O, O$^+$, Si, Si$^+$, and
Si$^{2+}$ following the formation of carbon-enhanced metal poor stars. The
presence of background UV flux delays the collapse from $z=21$ to $z=15$ and
cool the gas down to the CMB temperature for a metallicity of
Z/Z$_\odot$=10$^{-3}$. This can potentially lead to the formation of lower mass
stars. Overall, we find that the metals have a stronger effect on the collapse
than the radiation, yielding a comparable thermal structure for large
variations in the radiative background. We further find that radiative
backgrounds are not able to delay the collapse for Z/Z$_\odot$=10$^{-2}$ or a
carbon abundance as in SMSS J031300.36-670839.3.

  During Aerial Spraying","29 pages, 5 figures, 2 tables. arXiv admin note: text overlap with
  arXiv:0902.1616","Acta Tropica, 125: 202-213, 2013",,,"q-bio.OT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A set of discrete formulae that calculates the hypothetical impact of aerial
spraying on a tsetse population is derived and the work is thought to be novel.
Both the original population and the subsequent generations which survive the
aerial spraying, may ultimately be thought of as deriving from two, distinct
sources. These origins are, however, neither distinct, nor relevant by the
third generation. It is for this reason that the female population is
considered to be composed of the following four categories for the purposes of
derivation: Original flies which existed as such at the commencement of
spraying; original pupae which existed as such at the commencement of spraying;
the immediate descendants of both the aforementioned categories, during
spraying; third and higher generation descendants. In theory, the latter
category is a recurrence relation. In practice, the third generation's pupal
stage has hardly come into existence, even by the end of a completed operation.
Implicit in the formulae is the assumption of one, temperature-dependent
mortality rate for the entire pupal stage, a second for the period between
eclosion and ovulation and yet a third for the entire, adult life-span. Gravid
female resistance to the insecticide is assumed to be inconsequential. A
further assumption of the formulae is that at least one male is always
available (degree of sterility variable).

  the existing model has some errors",,,,"cs.CL math.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  While language competition models of diachronic language shift are
increasingly sophisticated, drawing on sociolinguistic components like variable
language prestige, distance from language centers and intermediate bilingual
transitionary populations, in one significant way they fall short. They fail to
consider contact-based outcomes resulting in mixed language practices, e.g.
outcome scenarios such as creoles or unmarked code switching as an emergent
communicative norm. On these lines something very interesting is uncovered in
India, where traditionally there have been monolingual Hindi speakers and
Hindi/English bilinguals, but virtually no monolingual English speakers. While
the Indian census data reports a sharp increase in the proportion of
Hindi/English bilinguals, we argue that the number of Hindi/English bilinguals
in India is inaccurate, given a new class of urban individuals speaking a mixed
lect of Hindi and English, popularly known as ""Hinglish"". Based on
predator-prey, sociolinguistic theories, salient local ecological factors and
the rural-urban divide in India, we propose a new mathematical model of
interacting monolingual Hindi speakers, Hindi/English bilinguals and Hinglish
speakers. The model yields globally asymptotic stable states of coexistence, as
well as bilingual extinction. To validate our model, sociolinguistic data from
different Indian classes are contrasted with census reports: We see that
purported urban Hindi/English bilinguals are unable to maintain fluent Hindi
speech and instead produce Hinglish, whereas rural speakers evidence
monolingual Hindi. Thus we present evidence for the first time where an
unrecognized mixed lect involving English but not ""English"", has possibly taken
over a sizeable faction of a large global population.

will be useful to study final state of quantum perturbed spherically symmetric
curved space times. Thus we take Einstein-massless-scalar $\psi$ tensor gravity
model described on class of spherically symmetric curved space times. We
rewrite the action functional in 2d analogue in terms of dimensionless
dilaton-matter field $(\chi=\Phi\psi)$ where dilaton field $\Phi$ is conformal
factor of 2-sphere. Then we seek renormalized expectation value of quantum
dilaton-matter field stress tensor operator by applying Hadamard
rennormalization prescription. Singularity of the Green function is assumed to
be has logarithmic form. Covariantly conservation condition on the renormalized
quantum dilaton-matter stress tensor demands to input a variable cosmological
parameter $\lambda(x)$. Energy conditions (weak, strong and null) is studied on
the obtained renormalized stress tensor leading to dynamical equations for
$\lambda(x), \Phi$ and quantum vacuum state $W_0(x)=<0|\hat{\chi}^2|0>_{ren}.$
In weak quantum field limits our obtained trace anomaly corresponds to one
which obtained from zeta function regularization method. Setting null-like
apparent horizon equation $\nabla_c\Phi\nabla^c\Phi=0,$ our procedure predicts
that physically correct value of the parameter in the anomaly trace
$\frac{1}{24\pi}\{R-\alpha\frac{\nabla_{c}\nabla^{c}\Phi}{\Phi}+(\alpha-6)\frac{\nabla_c\Phi\nabla^c\Phi}{\Phi^2}
\}$ should be $\alpha=6.$ At last we solved the backreaction equation and
obtained explicitly metric field solution in the slow varying limits of the
quantum and dilaton fields which has black holes topology and its singularity
is covered by apparent horizon hypersurface.
