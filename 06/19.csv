plasma winds can be found in different scenarios, from the interaction
occurring between regions inside galaxy clusters to the interaction between the
solar wind and Mars, Venus, active comets or even the interaction between Titan
and the Saturnian's magnetospheric flow. These objects generate, through
several current systems, perturbations in the streaming magnetic field leading
to its draping around the obstacle's effective conducting surface. Recent
observational results suggest that several properties associated with the
magnetic field draping, such as the location of the polarity reversal layer of
the induced magnetotail, are affected by variations in the conditions of the
streaming magnetic field. To improve our understanding of these phenomena, we
perform a characterization of several magnetic field draping signatures by
analytically solving an ideal problem in which a perfectly conducting
magnetized plasma (with frozen-in magnetic field conditions) flows around a
spherical body for various orientations of the streaming magnetic field. In
particular, we compute the shift of the inverse polarity reversal layer as the
orientation of the background magnetic field is changed.

  of Bone Shapes",,,,"CMPC14-02","cs.LG physics.med-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Bone age assessment is a task performed daily in hospitals worldwide. This
involves a clinician estimating the age of a patient from a radiograph of the
non-dominant hand.
  Our approach to automated bone age assessment is to modularise the algorithm
into the following three stages: segment and verify hand outline; segment and
verify bones; use the bone outlines to construct models of age. In this paper
we address the final question: given outlines of bones, can we learn how to
predict the bone age of the patient? We examine two alternative approaches.
Firstly, we attempt to train classifiers on individual bones to predict the
bone stage categories commonly used in bone ageing. Secondly, we construct
regression models to directly predict patient age.
  We demonstrate that models built on summary features of the bone outline
perform better than those built using the one dimensional representation of the
outline, and also do at least as well as other automated systems. We show that
models constructed on just three bones are as accurate at predicting age as
expert human assessors using the standard technique. We also demonstrate the
utility of the model by quantifying the importance of ethnicity and sex on age
development. Our conclusion is that the feature based system of separating the
image processing from the age modelling is the best approach for automated bone
ageing, since it offers flexibility and transparency and produces accurate
estimates.

query processing cost of the $(K,L)$-parameterized Locality Sensitive Hashing
(LSH) algorithm with minwise hashing, from $O(dKL)$ to merely $O(d + KL)$,
where $d$ is the number of nonzeros of the data vector, $K$ is the number of
hashes in each hash table, and $L$ is the number of hash tables. While that is
a substantial improvement, our analysis reveals that the existing densification
scheme is sub-optimal. In particular, there is no enough randomness in that
procedure, which affects its accuracy on very sparse datasets.
  In this paper, we provide a new densification procedure which is provably
better than the existing scheme. This improvement is more significant for very
sparse datasets which are common over the web. The improved technique has the
same cost of $O(d + KL)$ for query processing, thereby making it strictly
preferable over the existing procedure. Experimental evaluations on public
datasets, in the task of hashing based near neighbor search, support our
theoretical findings.

proper-motion membership, has been used to isolate 382 highly probable,
single-star unevolved main-sequence members over a 20-arcminute field centered
on the cluster. From 278 F dwarfs with high precision photometry in all
indices, a mean reddening of E(b-y) = 0.117 +/- 0.005 or E(B-V) = 0.160 +/-
0.007 is derived, where the standard errors of the mean include both internal
errors and the photometric zero-point uncertainty. With the reddening fixed,
the metallicity derived from the same 278 stars is [Fe/H] = -0.116 +/- 0.101
from m_1 and -0.055 +/- 0.033 from hk, for a weighted average of [Fe/H] = -0.06
+/- 0.04, where the quoted standard errors of the mean values include the
internal errors from the photometric scatter plus the uncertainty in the
photometric zero points. If metallicity is derived using individual reddening
values for each star to account for potential reddening variation across the
face of the cluster, the analogous result is unchanged. The cluster members at
the turnoff of the color-magnitude diagram are used to test and confirm the
recently discovered variation in reddening across the face of the cluster, with
a probable range in the variation of Delta[E(B-V)] = 0.045 +/-0.015. With the
slightly higher reddening and lower [Fe/H] compared to commonly adopted values,
isochrone fitting leads to an age of 2.3 +/- 0.2 Gyr for an apparent modulus of

in the generic case, the long-time evolution can be described by a hierarchy of
cycles defined by the action functional for corresponding stochastic processes.

the six basic cosmological parameters determined from this combination of data
will predict the underlying primordial temperature spectrum at high multipoles
to better than $1\%$ accuracy. Assuming an efficient cleaning from
multi-frequency channels of most foregrounds in the temperature data, we
investigate the sensitivity to the only residual secondary component, the
kinematic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (kSZ) term. The CMB polarization is used to break
degeneracies between primordial and secondary terms present in temperature and,
in effect, to remove from the temperature data all but the residual kSZ term.
We estimate a $15 \sigma$ detection of the diffuse homogeneous kSZ signal from
expected AdvACT temperature data at $\ell>1500$, leading to a measurement of
the amplitude of matter density fluctuations, $\sigma_8$, at $1\%$ precision.
Alternatively, by exploring the reionization signal encoded in the patchy kSZ
measurements, we bound the time and duration of the reionization with
$\sigma(z_{\rm re})=1.1$ and $\sigma(\Delta z_{\rm re})=0.2$. We find that
these constraints degrade rapidly with large beam sizes, which highlights the
importance of arcminute-scale resolution for future CMB surveys.

Observations before, during and after a second outburst in 2010 constrain the
outburst duration to be less than 3 months (with no lower limit). The X-ray
spectrum is a hard powerlaw ($\Gamma$=0.3) with fitted column density
($N_H$=6.3$\times$10$^{21}$ atom cm$^{-2}$) consistent with the established
absorption to sources in IC10. The optical spectrum shows hydrogen Balmer lines
strongly in emission, at the correct blueshift (-340 km/s) for IC10. The NIII
triplet emission feature is seen, accompanied by He II [4686] weakly in
emission. Together these features classify the star as a luminous blue
supergiant of the OBN subclass, characterized by enhanced nitrogen abundance.
Emission lines of HeI are seen, at similar strength to H$\beta$. A complex of
FeII permitted and forbidden emission lines are seen, as in B[e] stars. The

relativity is the coupling between the spin of an electron and its orbital
motion. This is at the origin of the fine structure in atoms, the spin Hall
effect in semiconductors, and underlies many intriguing properties of
topological insulators, in particular their chiral edge states. Configurations
where neutral particles experience an effective spin-orbit coupling have been
recently proposed and realized using ultracold atoms and photons. Here we use
coupled micropillars etched out of a semiconductor microcavity to engineer a
spin-orbit Hamiltonian for photons and polaritons in a microstructure. The
coupling between the spin and orbital momentum arises from the polarisation
dependent confinement and tunnelling of photons between micropillars arranged
in the form of a hexagonal photonic molecule. Dramatic consequences of the
spin-orbit coupling are experimentally observed in these structures in the
wavefunction of polariton condensates, whose helical shape is directly visible
in the spatially resolved polarisation patterns of the emitted light. The
strong optical nonlinearity of polariton systems suggests exciting perspectives
for using quantum fluids of polaritons11 for quantum simulation of the
interplay between interactions and spin-orbit coupling.

spectra from Planck to reconstruct the shape of the primordial power spectrum
and locate possible features. Performing an extensive error analysis we found
the dip near $\ell\sim750-850$ represents the most prominent feature in the

in 217 GHz spectrum and is apparently consequence of a small systematic as

consistent with the reconstructed form of the PPS at 2$\sigma$ C.L. of the

consistency test, we found the reconstructed primordial power spectrum from

allowing an overall amplitude shift of $\sim2.5\%$. In this context low-$\ell$

we present two smooth form of the PPS containing only the important features.
These smooth forms of PPS can provide significant improvements in fitting the

arises from an interplay between active contractility (and passive

and highly parallelizable algorithms, which often obtain nearly
state-of-the-art performance.
  In the first part of this paper, we analyze the convergence rates of several
general splitting algorithms and provide examples to prove the tightness of our
results. The most general rates are proved for the \emph{fixed-point residual}
(FPR) of the Krasnosel'ski\u{i}-Mann (KM) iteration of nonexpansive operators,
where we improve the known big-$O$ rate to little-$o$. We show the tightness of
this result and improve it in several special cases. In the second part of this
paper, we use the convergence rates derived for the KM iteration to analyze the
\emph{objective error} convergence rates for the Douglas-Rachford (DRS),
Peaceman-Rachford (PRS), and ADMM splitting algorithms under general convexity
assumptions. We show, by way of example, that the rates obtained for these

algorithm is nearly as fast as the proximal point algorithm (PPA) in the
ergodic sense and nearly as slow as the subgradient method in the nonergodic

layers (such as h-BN) has opened up possibility of examining highly correlated
states of electron systems in parts of their phase diagram that is impossible
to access in their counterpart devices such as semiconductor heterostructures.
An example of such states are Graphene (or Graphene like) double layer
electron-hole systems under strong magnetic fields where the separation between
layers can be of the order of one magnetic length with interlayer tunneling
still suppressed. In those separations correlations between electrons and holes
are of crucial importance and must be included in determination of observable
quantities. Here we report a thorough mean-field study of the coherent and
crystalline ground states of the interacting balanced electron-hole Graphene
systems in small and intermediate separations with each layer occupying up to
four lowest lying Landau levels. We calculate the capacitance of such states as
a function of layer separation and filling factor. Our calculations show
significant enhancement of the capacitance compared to geometrical value due to
quantum mechanical corrections.

such a spike if the 1-3 GeV excess observed in Fermi data is due to DM
annihilations. We find that for the parameter values favored in recent fits,
the point source-like flux from the spike is 35 times greater than the flux

detections near the GC. We consider the dependence of the spike signal on
astrophysical and particle parameters and conclude that if the GC excess is due
to DM, then a canonical adiabatic spike is disfavored by the data. We discuss
alternative Galactic histories that predict different spike signals, including:
(i) the nonadiabatic growth of the black hole, possibly associated with halo
and/or black hole mergers, (ii) gravitational interaction of DM with baryons in
the dense core, such as heating by stars, or (iii) DM self-interactions. We
emphasize that the spike signal is sensitive to a different combination of

a rich, multi-wavelength dataset, we aim to confirm the lensing hypothesis and
model the background source's morphology and dynamics, as well as to provide a
full physical characterisation. Methods: Multi-wavelength high-resolution data
is utilised to assess the nature of the system. A lensing-analysis algorithm
which simultaneously fits different wavebands is adopted to characterise the
lens. The background galaxy dynamical information is studied by reconstructing
the 3-D source-plane of the ALMA CO(J:4-3) transition. Near-IR imaging from HST
and Keck-AO allows to constrain rest-frame optical photometry independently for
the foreground and background systems. Physical parameters (such as stellar and
dust masses) are estimated via modelling of the spectral energy distribution
taking into account source blending, foreground obscuration, and differential
magnification. Results: The system comprises a foreground edge-on disk galaxy
(at z_sp=0.218) with an almost complete Einstein ring around it. The background
source (at z_sp=1.027) is magnified by a factor of ~8-10 depending on
wavelength. It is comprised of two components and a tens of kpc long tidal tail
resembling the Antennae merger. As a whole, the system is a massive stellar
system (1.32[-0.41,+0.63] x1E11 Mo) forming stars at a rate of 394+-90 Mo/yr,
and has a significant gas reservoir M_ISM = 4.6+-1.7 x1E10 Mo. Its depletion
time due to star formation alone is thus expected to be
tau_SF=M_ISM/SFR=117+-51 Myr. The dynamical mass of one of the components is
estimated to be 5.8+-1.7 x1E10 Mo, and, together with the photometric total
mass estimate, it implies that H1429-0028 is a major merger system
(1:2.8[-1.5,+1.8]).

of cosmology (SMoC) implies a haphazard merger history driven by dynamical
friction on dark matter halos. The SMoC is tested here with the results that
the dual dwarf galaxy theorem is in contradiction to the data if the SMoC is
true, and the action of dynamical friction is not evident in the galaxy
population. A consistency test for this conclusion comes from the significantly
anisotropic distributions of satellite galaxies. Independently, the long
history of failures of the SMoC have the likelihood that it describes the
observed Universe to less than 10^-4 per cent. The implication for fundamental
physics is that exotic dark matter particles do not exist and that consequently
effective gravitational physics on the scales of galaxies and beyond ought to
be non-Newtonian/non-Einsteinian. The data imply that scale-invariant dynamics,
as discovered by Milgrom, is an excellent description of galaxies in the
weak-field regime. Observations of stellar populations in galaxies suggest the
galaxy-wide IMF, the IGIMF, to vary with star formation rate and that
stochastic descriptions of star formation are inconsistent with the data. A
consequence of this understanding of galactic astrophysics is that most dwarf
satellite galaxies are formed as tidal dwarf galaxies in galaxy-galaxy
encounters, that they follow the mass-metallicity relation, that galactic
mergers are rare, that galaxies immersed in external potentials are physically
larger than isolated galaxies and that star-forming galaxies form a main
sequence. Eight predictions are offered which will allow the concepts raised
here to be tested. A very conservative, cold- and warm-dark-matter-free
cosmological model may be emerging from these considerations.

a stronger impact on the dynamics than power-law spectra. For realistic

a function of the density, rotate on cylinders in the presence of a
gravitational potential, so that the angular frequency of such a disk is
independent of height. Such disks with barotropic equilibria can be
approximately modeled using the shearing box framework, representing a small
disk volume with height-independent angular frequency. If the disk is in
baroclinic equilibrium, the angular frequency does generally depend on height,
and it is thus necessary to go beyond the standard shearing box approach. In
this paper, we show that given a global disk model, it is possible to develop
approximate models that are local in horizontal planes without an expansion in
height with shearing-periodic boundary conditions. We refer to the resulting
framework as the vertically global shearing box (VGSB). These models can be
non-axisymmetric for globally barotropic equilibria but should be axisymmetric
for globally baroclinic equilibria. We provide explicit equations for this VGSB
which can be implemented in standard magnetohydrodynamic codes by generalizing
the shearing-periodic boundary conditions to allow for a height-dependent
angular frequency and shear rate. We also discuss the limitations that result
from the radial approximations that are needed in order to impose
height-dependent shearing periodic boundary conditions. We illustrate the
potential of this framework by studying a vertical shear instability and
examining the modes associated with the magnetorotational instability.

present a new approach to evolving partial differential equations occurring in
black hole perturbation theory and calculations of the self-force acting on
point particles orbiting supermassive black holes. Such equations are
distributionally sourced, and standard numerical methods, such as
finite-difference or spectral methods, face difficulties associated with
approximating discontinuous functions. However, in the self-force problem we
typically have access to full a-priori information about the local structure of
the discontinuity at the particle. Using this information, we show that
high-order accuracy can be recovered by adding to the Lagrange interpolation
formula a linear combination of certain jump amplitudes. We construct
discontinuous spatial and temporal discretizations by operating on the
corrected Lagrange formula. In a method-of-lines framework, this provides a
simple and efficient method of solving time-dependent partial differential
equations, without loss of accuracy near moving singularities or
discontinuities. This method is well-suited for the problem of time-domain
reconstruction of the metric perturbation via the Teukolsky or
Regge-Wheeler-Zerilli formalisms. Parallel implementations on modern CPU and

black holes (BHs) rather than neutron stars (NSs) upon death. It has been
common practice to assume that a given zero-age main sequence (ZAMS) mass star

this fails to account for a myriad of other variables that may effect this
outcome, such as spin, binarity, or even stochastic differences in the stellar

of NS versus BH formation may be better suited to account for the current
uncertainties in understanding how massive stars die. We present an initial
exploration of the probability that a star will make a BH as a function of its

extremality, where the anisotropy is big compared to the temperature, some
components of the viscosity tensor become parametrically small compared to the
entropy density. We study the quasi normal modes in considerable detail and
find no instability close to extremality. We also obtain the equations for
fluid mechanics for an anisotropic driven system in general, working upto first
order in the derivative expansion for the stress tensor, and identify

violated if and only if the joint probability distribution for the quadruples
of observables involved the EPR-Bohm-Bell experiment does not exist, i.e., it
is impossible to use the classical probabilistic model (Kolmogorov, 1933). In
this note we demonstrate that, in spite of Fine's theorem, the results of
observations in the EPR-Bohm-Bell experiment can be described in the classical
probabilistic framework. However, the ""quantum probabilities"" have to be
interpreted as conditional probabilities, where conditioning is with respect to
fixed experimental settings. Our approach is based on the complete account of
randomness involved in the experiment. The crucial point is that randomness of
selections of experimental settings has to be taken into account. This approach
can be applied to any complex experiment in which statistical data are
collected for various (in general incompatible) experimental settings. Finally,
we emphasize that our construction of the classical probability space for the
EPR-Bohm-Bell experiment cannot be used to support the hidden variable approach
to the quantum phenomena. The classical random parameter $\omega$ involved in
our considerations cannot be identified with the hidden variable $\lambda$
which is used the Bell-type considerations.

this particle. So far $\mu_p$ has only been measured indirectly, analysing the
spectrum of an atomic hydrogen maser in a magnetic field. Here, we report the
direct high-precision measurement of the magnetic moment of a single proton
using the double Penning-trap technique. We drive proton-spin quantum jumps by
a magnetic radio-frequency field in a Penning trap with a homogeneous magnetic
field. The induced spin-transitions are detected in a second trap with a strong
superimposed magnetic inhomogeneity. This enables the measurement of the
spin-flip probability as a function of the drive frequency. In each measurement
the proton's cyclotron frequency is used to determine the magnetic field of the
trap. From the normalized resonance curve, we extract the particle's magnetic
moment in units of the nuclear magneton $\mu_p=2.792847350(9)\mu_N$. This
measurement outperforms previous Penning trap measurements in terms of
precision by a factor of about 760. It improves the precision of the forty year
old indirect measurement, in which significant theoretical bound state
corrections were required to obtain $\mu_p$, by a factor of 3. By application
of this method to the antiproton magnetic moment $\mu_{\bar{p}}$ the fractional
precision of the recently reported value can be improved by a factor of at

test of matter/antimatter symmetry with baryons.

smooth and nontrivial Nc limit can be obtained if g^2 Nc^(a-1) is held fixed

However, in lower space-time dimensions (2+1, 1+1), for any Nc, renormalization
group flow for such theories always has a stable ultraviolet fixed point at g =
0; the theory is thus ultraviolet complete. For the case of massless quarks,
the theory has an infrared fixed point. For massive quarks, the theory is
confining. The confining scale is parametrically of the order Nc^((2-a)/(4-d))

  A simple explanation of the equality between noncommutative and commutative

on measuring the density of background galaxies behind the clusters. The most
common ways of measuring this quantity ignore the fact that some fraction of
the sky is obscured by the cluster galaxies themselves, reducing the area in
which background galaxies can be observed. We discuss the size of this effect
in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope
Lensing Survey (CFHTLenS), finding a minimum 1 per cent effect at
$0.1h^{-1}$Mpc from the centers of clusters in SDSS; the effect is an order of
magnitude higher in CFHTLenS. The resulting biases on cluster mass and
concentration measurements are of the same order as the size of the obscuration
effect, which is below the statistical errors for cluster lensing in SDSS but
likely exceeds them for CFHTLenS. We also forecast the impact of this
systematic error on cluster mass and magnification measurements in several
upcoming surveys, and find that it typically exceeds the statistical errors. We
conclude that future surveys must account for this effect in stacked lensing
and magnification measurements in order to avoid being dominated by systematic
error.

like LCDM, assumes the presence of dark energy in addition to (baryonic and
non-luminous) matter and radiation. Unlike LCDM, however, it is also
constrained by the equation of state (EOS) p=-rho/3, in terms of the total
pressure p and energy density rho. One-on-one comparative tests between R_h=ct
and LCDM have been carried out using over 14 different cosmological
measurements and observations. In every case, the data have favoured R_h=ct
over the standard model, with model selection tools yielding a likelihood
~90-95% that the former is correct, versus only ~5-10% for the latter. In other
words, the standard model without the EOS p=-rho/3 does not appear to be the
optimal description of nature. Yet in spite of these successes---or perhaps
because of them---several concerns have been published recently regarding the
fundamental basis of the theory itself. The latest paper on this subject even
claims---quite remarkably---that R_h=ct is a vacuum solution, though quite
evidently rho is not 0. Here, we address these concerns and demonstrate that
all criticisms leveled thus far against R_h=ct, including the supposed vacuum
condition, are unwarranted. They all appear to be based on incorrect

these phenomena ultimately drive space weather in the heliosphere. This phase
is known to occur between the photosphere and low corona, where many models
introduce an instability and/or magnetic reconnection that triggers a CME,
often with associated flaring activity. To this end, it is important to obtain
a variety of observations of the low corona in order to build as clear a
picture as possible of the dynamics that occur therein. Here, we combine the
EUV imagery of the SWAP instrument on board PROBA2 with the white-light imagery
of the ground-based Mk4 coronameter at MLSO in order to bridge the
observational gap that exists between the disk imagery of AIA on board SDO and
the coronal imagery of LASCO on board SOHO. Methods of multiscale image
analysis were applied to the observations to better reveal the coronal signal
while suppressing noise and other features. This allowed an investigation into
the initiation phase of a CME that was driven by a rising flux rope structure
from a ""two-stage"" flaring active region underlying an extended helmet
streamer. It was found that the initial outward motion of the erupting loop
system in the EUV observations coincided with the first X-ray flare peak, and
led to a plasma pile-up of the white-light CME core material. The characterized
CME core then underwent a strong jerk in its motion, as the early acceleration
increased abruptly, simultaneous with the second X-ray flare peak. The overall
system expanded into the helmet streamer to become the larger CME structure
observed in the LASCO coronagraph images, which later became concave-outward in
shape. Theoretical models for the event are discussed in light of these unique
observations, and it is concluded that the formation of either a kink-unstable
or torus-unstable flux rope may be the likeliest scenario.

this hope by revealing that the complexity in gate count of such simulations
increases with the number of spin orbitals $N$ as $N^8$, which becomes
prohibitive even for molecules of modest size $N\sim 100$. This study was
partly based on a scaling analysis of the Trotter step required for an ensemble
of random artificial molecules. Here, we revisit this analysis and find instead
that the scaling is closer to $N^6$ in worst case for real model molecules we
have studied, indicating that the random ensemble fails to accurately capture
the statistical properties of real-world molecules. Actual scaling may be
significantly better than this due to averaging effects. We then present an
alternative simulation scheme and show that it can sometimes outperform
existing schemes, but that this possibility depends crucially on the details of
the simulated molecule. We obtain further improvements using a version of the
coalescing scheme of \cite{WBCH13a}; this scheme is based on using different
Trotter steps for different terms. The method we use to bound the complexity of
simulating a given molecule is efficient, in contrast to the approach of
\cite{WBCH13a,HWBT14a} which relied on exponentially costly classical exact

By retaining the quark transverse momentum, employing the Sudakov factors, and
choosing the typical scale as the maximum virtualities of the internal
particles, we calculate the $B_{c}$ ${\to}$ $B$ transition from factors, and
our results show that about 90\% contribution to form factors come from the
${\alpha}_{s}/{\pi}$ $<$ $0.3$ region. The contributions of penguin and
annihilation to branching ratios are very small due to the serious suppression
by the CKM factors. There is some hierarchy relations among the $B_{c}$ ${\to}$

The states in question are defined by Euclidean time evolution of conformal
boundary states associated with the particular boundary conditions imposed on
the edges of the strip. We explain this behavior, and the associated lack of
thermalization, by showing that such states are Lorentz-signature conformal
transformations of the strip ground state. Taking the long-strip limit implies
that states used to model thermalization on the Minkowski plane admit
non-thermal conformal extensions beyond future infinity of the Minkowski plane,
and thus retain some notion of non-thermal behavior at late times. We also
comment on the holographic description of these states.

However, having the CSI of relay-destination link at relay is not always
possible due to the practical considerations of the wireless system. In

system's temperature is above the critical temperature, the potential of a

self-consistently specified according to our method. As an example, stationary
axisymmetric and force-free jet models around rotating black holes are
self-consistently constructed according to the method we proposed. This jet
solution distinguishes itself from prior known analytic solutions in that it is
highly collimated and asymptotically approaches a magnetic cylinder. This jet
solution is helically twisted, since toroidal magnetic field is generated when
the black hole spin is taken into account. For a given magnetic flux threading
the black hole, the jet power and energy extraction rate of the collimated jet
are compared with previous solutions. We find that our new solution agrees
better with current state-of-the-art numerical simulation results. Some
interesting properties of the collimated jet and effects of field line rotation

surface lives in hyperbolic space $H_3$ (or equivalently Euclidean AdS$_3$
space). We argue that finding the area of such extremal surface can be easily
done if we solve the following problem: given two real periodic functions
$V_{0,1}(s)$, $V_{0,1}(s+2\pi)=V_{0,1}(s)$, a third periodic function $V_2(s)$
is to be found such that all solutions to the equation $- \phi""(s) +

value of $\lambda$. This problem is equivalent to the statement that the
monodromy matrix is trivial. It can be restated as that of finding a one
complex parameter family of curves $X(\lambda,s)$ where $X(\lambda=1,s)$ is the
given shape of the Wilson loop and such that the Schwarzian derivative
$\{X(\lambda,s),s\}$ is meromorphic in $\lambda$ with only two simple poles. We
present a formula for the area in terms of the functions $V_{0,1,2}$ and

quantum algorithms, most notably those involving quantum Fourier transforms. We
describe surface code implementations of two recently described methods of
efficiently constructing these rotations. One method uses state distillation to
get low-error (|0> + exp(i pi/2^k)|1>)/sqrt(2) states, with each distillation
level requiring 2^(k+2)-1 input states to produce a single purer output state,
and uses these distilled states to directly implement pi/2^k angle Z rotations.
The other method is indirect, using sequences of single-qubit Clifford and T
gates. We compute and compare the overhead of our surface code implementations
of these two techniques. We find that the approximating sequence overhead is
less than or equal to direct distillation for k > 3 and logical error rates <~
10^-12.

from a satellite to a receiver depends on diversified phenomena and makes
probabilistic upper-bound of possible threats difficult. To widen application
fields of satellite navigation, two methods to upper-bound wide classes of bias

which breaks both continuous and discrete symmetries. In such a phase, the

field and its time variations. Understanding the variability of those deep
currents is crucial to improve the forecast of geomagnetic field variations,
which affect human spacial and aeronautic activities. Moreover, it may provide
relevant information on the core dynamics. The main goal of this study is to
extract and characterize the leading variability modes of core flows over
centennial periods, and to assess their statistical robustness. To this end, we
use flows that we invert from two geomagnetic field models (gufm1 and COV-OBS),
and apply Principal Component Analysis and Singular Value Decomposition of
coupled fields. The quasi geostrophic (QG) flows inverted from both geomagnetic
field models show similar features. However, COV-OBS has a less energetic mean
and larger time variability. The statistical significance of flow components is
tested from analyses performed on subareas of the whole domain. Bootstrapping
methods are also used to extract significant flow features required by both
gufm1 and COV-OBS. Three main empirical circulation modes emerge,
simultaneously constrained by both geomagnetic field models and expected to be
robust against the particular a priori used to build them (large scale QG
dynamics). Mode 1 exhibits three large vortices at medium/high latitudes, with
opposite circulation under the Atlantic and the Pacific hemispheres. Mode 2
interestingly accounts for most of the variations of the Earth's core angular
momentum. In this mode, the regions close to the tangent cylinder and to the
equator are correlated, and oscillate with a period between 80 and 90 years.
Each of these two modes is energetic enough to alter the mean flow, sometimes
reinforcing the eccentric gyre, and other times breaking it up into smaller
circulations. The three main circulation modes added together to the mean flow
account for about 70% of the flows variability, 90% of the root mean square
total velocities, and 95% of the secular variation induced by the total flows.
Direct physical interpretation of the computed modes is not straightforward.
Nonethe-less, similarities found between the two first modes and time/spatial
features identified in different studies of core dynamics, suggest that our
approach can help to pinpoint the relevant physical processes inside the core
on centennial timescales.

insulating phases deposited on a substrate, are characterized by two distinct
electronic transport regimes depending on the relative amount of the metallic
phase. At sufficiently large metallic loadings, granular metals behave as
percolating systems with a well-defined critical concentration above which
macroscopic clusters of physically connected conductive particles span the
entire sample. Below the critical loading, granular metal films are in the
dielectric regime, where current can flow throughout the composite only via
hopping or tunneling processes between isolated nanosized particles or
clusters. In this case transport is intrinsically non-percolative in the sense
that no critical concentration can be identified for the onset of transport. It
is shown here that, although being very different in nature, these two regimes
can be described by treating percolation and hopping on equal footing. By
considering general features of the microstructure and of the electrical
connectedness, the concentration dependence of the dc conductivity of several
nanogranular metal films is reproduced to high accuracy within an effective
medium approach. In particular, fits to published experimental data enable us
to extract the values of microscopic parameters that govern the percolation and
tunneling regimes, explaining thus the transport properties observed in
nanogranular metal films.

antipolarons (counter-displacements due to quantum tunneling effects). We
present a comprehensive study of the ground state two-level system population

investigated by looking at spectroscopic signatures of the bipartite
entanglement entropy between a given environmental mode and all the other

dissipation, indicative of the entangled nature of the environmental states. In
addition, the entropy spreads over a large energy range at strong dissipation,
a testimony to the wide entanglement window characterizing the underlying Kondo
state. Finally, comparisons to accurate numerical renormalization group

the rapid convergence of our variationally-optimized multi-polaron expansion,

The rate of condensation must be equal to the slope of (Mpi^2 Fpi^2)/2 with

and the decay constant of the Nambu-Goldstone bosons. We compute the spectral

astrophysically relevant region (which lies between 7.8 and 11.48 MeV at 3 GK
stellar temperature). The 162Er(a,n)165Yb reaction was studied above the
reaction threshold between Ec.m. = 12.19 and 16.09 MeV. The fact that the
162Er(a,g)166Yb cross sections were measured below the (a,n) threshold at first
time in this mass region opens the opportunity to study directly the a-widths
required for the determination of astrophysical reaction rates. The data
clearly show that compound nucleus formation in this reaction proceeds
differently than previously predicted.

  number of filaments",,,"10.1109/TASC.2014.2338320",,"cond-mat.supr-con","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Striation of HTS coated conductors (CCs) as a way to reduce their
magnetization AC losses has been the subject of intense research in the past
years by several groups. While the principle of this approach is well
understood, its practical application on commercial material to be used in
power application is still far to be implemented due to manufacturing and
technological constraints. Recent advances in tape quality and striation
technology are now enabling systematic investigations of the influence of the
number of filaments on AC loss reduction with a consistency that was not
available in the past. In this work we demonstrate the technological
feasibility of reducing the magnetization losses of commercially available CC
by striating them into a high number of filaments (up to 120). The loss
reduction exceeds one order of magnitude and does not come at the expense of
current-carrying capability: samples with 10 and 20 filaments are unaffected by
the striation process, while samples with 80 and 120 filaments still retain 80
and 70% of the current-carrying potential, respectively. We also investigate
the transverse resistivity in order to understand the paths followed by the
coupling currents: we found that the coupling current prevalently flows in the
metallic substrate, rather than in and out of the filaments. Finally, we use
oxidation as a method to reduce the coupling currents and losses. The
contribution of this work is three-fold: 1) It describes the know-how to
produce a large number of high quality striations in commercially available
CCs, greatly reducing their losses without extensively degrading their
transport properties; 2) It provides a comprehensive characterization of said
samples (e.g. measurements in a wide frequency range, transverse resistance
profiles, influence of oxidation on DC and AC behavior); 3) It provides new
insight on the patterns of the coupling currents.

It
might challenge the standard two-component glitch model, because large
fractions of superfluid neutrons are thought to be entrained in the lattices of
the crust part, then there is not enough superfluid neutrons to trigger the
large glitches in Vela-like pulsars. But the amount of entrainment which could
effectively constrain the fractional moment of inertia of a pulsar, is very
uncertain. In order to examine the importance of this parameter on the inner
structures of neutron stars, we relax the ""glitch crisis"" argument, employ a
set of most developed equations of state derived within microscopic many-body
approaches that could fulfill the recent 2-solar-mass constraint, and evaluate
their predictions for the fractional moment of inertia with two extremes of
crustal entrainment. We find a final determination of the amount of entrainment
could be closely related to the type of neutron star. If a large enough
fraction of neutrons are entrained, a Vela-like pulsar could not be a hybrid
star, namely no free quarks would be present in its core. In addition, we use
the Vela data to narrow the parameter space of hyperon-meson couplings in the
popular phenomenological relativistic mean field model.

automated method that determines the set of parameters of a model atmosphere

our analysis, we account for the spectrograph's varying resolution as a
function of fiber and wavelength. Our results for early SDSS (pre-BOSS upgrade)
data compare well with those from the SEGUE Stellar Parameter Pipeline (SSPP),
except for stars with logg (cgs units) lower than 2.5. An analysis of stars in
the globular cluster M13 reveals a dependence of the inferred metallicity on
surface gravity for stars with logg < 2.5, confirming the systematics
identified in the comparison with the SSPP. We find that our metallicity
estimates are significantly more precise than the SSPP results. We obtain a
halo metallicity distribution that is narrower and more asymmetric than in
previous studies. The lowest gravity stars in our sample, at tens of kpc from
the Sun, indicate a shift of the metallicity distribution to lower abundances,
consistent with what is expected from a dual halo system in the Milky Way.

wavefunctions, we calculate current density beyond linear response, which is in
particular relevant to the topological image monopole effect. As a major
result, the field theory describing the localization physics of the quantum
Hall effect of a single species of Dirac fermions is derived. In this
connection, the issue of (absent) parity anomaly is revisited. The
renormalization group flow (RG) and the resulting phase diagram are extensively
discussed. Starting values of the RG flow are given by the semiclassical
conductivity tensor which is obtained from the Boltzmann transport theory of
the anomalous Hall effect.

consider for the symmetry energy three parametrizations with density providing
similar values at saturation but which manifest very different slopes around
this point. In this way we can explore how the slope affects the collective
response of finite nuclear systems. We focus first on the dipole polarizability
and show that while the model is able to describe the expected mass dependence,
A^{5/3}, it also demonstrates that this quantity is sensitive to the slope
parameter of the symmetry energy. Then, by considering the Sn isotopic chain,
we investigate the emergence of a collective mode, the Pygmy Dipole Resonance

energy-weighted sum rule exhausted by this mode has a linear dependence with
the square of isospin I=(N-Z)/A, again sensitive to the slope of the symmetry
energy with density. Therefore the polarization effects in the isovector
density have to play an important role in the dynamics of PDR. These results
provide additional hints in the investigations aiming to extract the properties

two-dimensional (hkl) crystal planes coupled to each other. For crystals with
negligible spin-orbit coupling, we report a rigorous proof of a criterion on
the non-existence of surface states in a semi-infinite crystal with the crystal
symmetry. The forward transfer to be the same as the backward one, called as
F-B dynamical symmetry, is key to realize the criterion. Based on lattice model
Hamiltonian with coupling between the nearest neighbor crystal planes only, we
prove that a cut crystal will not be able to accommodate any surface states if
the original infinite crystal has reflection symmetry about every crystal plane
which results in F-B symmetry. The criterion provide a platform to simply
conclude whether surface states exist or not in a cut crystal. For any such
crystals, the non-existence or existence of surface states depends on the cut
direction of the crystal plane. Since the spin-orbit coupling breaks the chiral
symmetry, resulting in the F-B asymmetry, surface states can emerge in the
(hkl) cut crystal with spin-orbit coupling.

exert on the power grid, and the mobility of loads represented by electric

examine a network of charging stations equipped with an energy storage device
and propose a scheme that allocates power to them from the grid, as well as
routes customers. We examine three scenarios, gradually increasing their
complexity. In the first one, all stations have identical charging capabilities
and energy storage devices, draw constant power from the grid and no routing
decisions of customers are considered. It represents the current state of
affairs and serves as a baseline for evaluating the performance of the proposed
scheme. In the second scenario, power to the stations is allocated in an
optimal manner from the grid and in addition a certain percentage of customers
can be routed to nearby stations. In the final scenario, optimal allocation of
both power from the grid and customers to stations is considered. The three
scenarios are evaluated using real traffic traces corresponding to weekday rush
hour from a large metropolitan area in the US. The results indicate that the
proposed scheme offers substantial improvements of performance compared to the
current mode of operation; namely, more customers can be served with the same
amount of power, thus enabling the station operators to increase their
profitability. Further, the scheme provides guarantees to customers in terms of
the probability of being blocked by the closest charging station. Overall, the
paper addresses key issues related to the efficient operation of a network of

temperatures below normal freezing is realized by antifreeze proteins (AFPs).
These are surface-active molecules and interact with the diffusive water/ice
interface thus preventing complete solidification. We propose a new dynamical
mechanism on how these proteins inhibit the freezing of water. We apply a
Ginzburg-Landau type approach to describe the phase separation in the
two-component system (ice, AFP). The free energy density involves two fields:
one for the ice phase with a low AFP concentration, and one for liquid water
with a high AFP concentration. The time evolution of the ice reveals
microstructures resulting from phase separation in the presence of AFPs. We
observed a faster clustering of pre-ice structure connected to a locking of
grain size by the action of AFP, which is an essentially dynamical process. The
adsorption of additional water molecules is inhibited and the further growth of
ice grains stopped. The interfacial energy between ice and water is lowered
allowing the AFPs to form smaller critical ice nuclei. Similar to a hysteresis
in magnetic materials we observe a thermodynamic hysteresis leading to a

the rain attenuation is predicted for five major cities of Bangladesh, namely

is estimated for different frequency and polarization. A horizontally polarized
signal encounters 15% more rain attenuation than that of vertically polarized

experiences about 5% less attenuation than the vertically polarized

Small orthorhombic symmetry-breaking distortion sets in at $T_{\rm HO}$ with a

This distortion is observed only in ultrapure sample, implying a highly unusual

compound URu$_2$Si$_2$, identifying which symmetries are broken below the
hidden order transition is one of the most important steps. Several recent
experiments on the electronic structure have shown that the Fermi surface in
the hidden order phase is quite close to the result of band-structure
calculations within the framework of itinerant electron picture assuming the
antiferromagnetism. This provides strong evidence for the band folding along
the c-axis with the ordering vector of $(0\,0\,1)$, corresponding to broken
translational symmetry. In addition to this, there is growing evidence for
fourfold rotational symmetry breaking in the hidden-order phase from
measurements of the in-plane magnetic anisotropy and the effective mass
anisotropy in the electronic structure, as well as the orthorhombic lattice
distortion. This broken fourfold symmetry gives a stringent constraint that the
symmetry of the hidden order parameter should belong to the degenerate $E$-type
irreducible representation. We also discuss a possibility that time reversal
symmetry is also broken, which further narrows down the order parameter that
characterizes the hidden order.

low, almost steady rate, then a rise phase of duration of 10 ks, followed by a

that the region has diameter in the range $0.5-0.6$ R$_*$. The hard X-ray

Fragmentation of the primordial gas is, however, a possible obstacle to SMS
formation. We discuss the expected properties of a compact, metal-free,
marginally unstable nuclear protogalactic disk, and the fate of the clumps
formed in the disk by gravitational instability. Interior to a characteristic
radius R_f=few*10^{-2} pc, the disk fragments into massive clumps with M_c~30
Msun. The clumps grow via accretion and migrate inward rapidly on a timescale
of ~10^4 yr, which is comparable or shorter than the Kelvin-Helmholz time >10^4
yr. Some clumps may evolve to zero-age main sequence stars and halt gas
accretion by radiative feedback, but most of the clumps can migrate inward and
merge with the central protostar before forming massive stars. Moreover, we
found that dust-induced-fragmentation in metal-enriched gas does not modify
these conclusions unless Z> 3*10^{-4} Zsun, because clump migration below this
metallicity remains as rapid as in the primordial case. Our results suggest
that fragmentation of a compact, metal--poor disk can not prevent the formation
of a SMS.

computationally expensive or even impossible. We propose a Bayesian outcome
prediction method that can be applied to data of arbitrary dimension d, from 2
outcome classes, and reduces overfitting without any approximations at
parameter level. This is achieved by avoiding numerical integration or
approximation, and solving the Bayesian integrals analytically. We thereby
reduce the dimension of numerical integrals from 2d dimensions to 4, for any d.
For large d, this is reduced further to 3, and we obtain a simple outcome
prediction formula without integrals in leading order for very large d. We
compare our method to the mclustDA method (Fraley and Raftery 2002), using
simulated and real data sets. Our method perform as well as or better than
mclustDA in low dimensions d. In large dimensions d, mclustDA breaks down due
to computational limitations, while our method provides a feasible and

magnetic flux tubes that constitute mottles and form the magnetic canopy in a
quiet Sun region, highlighting the details and key parameters of the mechanism
that produces power halos and magnetic shadows at the magnetic network observed
in H{\alpha}. We use calculations of the magnetic field vector and the height
of the magnetic canopy and simple assumptions to determine the turning height,
i.e., the height at which the fast magneto-acoustic waves reflect. We compare
the variation of acoustic power in the magnetic shadow and the power halo with
the results of a two-dimensional model on mode conversion and transmission. The
key parameter of the model is the attack angle, which is related to the
inclination of the magnetic field vector at the canopy height. Our analysis
takes also into account that 1) there are projection effects on the propagation
of waves, 2) the magnetic canopy and the turning height are curved layers, 3)
waves with periods longer than 3 min reach the chromosphere in the presence of
inclined magnetic fields (ramp effect), 4) mottles are canopy structures, and
5) the wings of H{\alpha} contain mixed signal from low- and high-{\beta}
plasma. The dependence of power on the attack angle follows the anticipated by
the two-dimensional model very well. Long-period slow waves are channeled to
the upper chromospheric layers following the magnetic field lines of mottles,
while short-period fast waves penetrate the magnetic canopy and reflect at the
turning height. Although both magnetoacoustic modes contribute to velocity
signals, making the interpretation of observations a challenging task, we
conclude that conversion and transmission of the acoustic waves into fast and
slow magnetoacoustic waves are responsible for forming power halos and magnetic
shadows in the quiet Sun region.

galaxy stellar mass functions are steep, and a significant amount of star
formation is hosted by low-mass haloes that may be missed in current
observations. Most of the stars in cluster centrals formed earlier than
$z\approx 2$ but have been assembled much later. Milky Way mass galaxies have
had on-going star formation without significant mergers since $z\approx 2$, and
are thus free of significant (classic) bulges produced by major mergers. In
massive clusters, stars bound in galaxies and scattered in the halo form a
homogeneous population that is old and with solar metallicity. In contrast, in
Milky Way mass systems the two components form two distinct populations, with
halo stars being older and poorer in metals by a factor of $\approx 3$. Dwarf
galaxies in haloes with $M_{\rm h} < 10^{11}h^{-1}M_{\odot}$ have experienced a
star formation burst accompanied by major mergers at $z > 2$, followed by a
nearly constant star formation rate after $z = 1$. The early burst leaves a

population. To shed light on this, we studied 172 stars belonging to the 5 SGBs
that we can identify in our photometry, in order to measure their [Fe/H]
content as well as estimate their age dispersion and the age-metallicity
relation. The first important result is that all of these SGBs has a
distribution in metallicity with a spread that exceeds the observational errors
and typically displays several peaks that indicate the presence of several
sub-populations. We were able to identified at least 6 of them based on their
mean [Fe/H] content. These metallicity-based sub-populations are seen to
varying extents in each of the 5 SGBs. Taking advantage of the age-sensitivity
of the SGB we showed that, first of all, at least half of the sub-populations
have an age spread of at least 2 Gyrs. Then we obtained an age-metallicity
relation that is the most complete up to date for this cluster. The
interpretation of the age-metallicity relation is not straightforward, but it
is possible that the cluster (or what we can call its progenitor) was initially
composed of two populations having different metallicities. Because of their
age, it is very unlikely that the most metal-rich derives from the most
metal-poor by some kind of chemical evolution process, so they must be assumed
as two independent primordial objects or perhaps two separate parts of a single
larger object, that merged in the past to form the present-day cluster.

However, the endmembers are assumed random to take into account their

model generalizing the normal compositional model. The proposed algorithm
exploits the whole image to provide spectral and spatial information. It
estimates both the mean and the covariance matrix of each endmember in the
image. This allows the behavior of each material to be analyzed and its
variability to be quantified in the scene. A spatial segmentation is also
obtained based on the estimated abundances. In order to estimate the parameters

evaluated via simulations conducted on both synthetic and real data.

stars between 280\degr < $\ell$ < 350\degr and 10degr < $\ell$ < 60\degr with
|b|<1.5degr. Combined with an existing sample of radio-selected methanol masers
and compact HII regions, the result is a catalogue of ~1700 massive stars
embedded within ~1300 clumps located across the inner Galaxy, containing three
observationally distinct subsamples, methanol-maser, MYSO and HII-region
associations, covering the most important tracers of massive star formation,
thought to represent key stages of evolution. We find that massive star
formation is strongly correlated with the regions of highest column density in
spherical, centrally condensed clumps. We find no significant differences
between the three samples in clump structure or the relative location of the
embedded stars, which suggests that the structure of a clump is set before the
onset of star formation, and changes little as the embedded object evolves
towards the main sequence. There is a strong linear correlation between clump
mass and bolometric luminosity, with the most massive stars forming in the most
massive clumps. We find that the MYSO and HII-region subsamples are likely to
cover a similar range of evolutionary stages and that the majority are near the
end of their main accretion phase. We find few infrared-bright MYSOs associated
with the most massive clumps, probably due to very short pre-main sequence
lifetimes in the most luminous sources.

cyclic ordering of the edges around each vertex. By adapting a construction due
to O. Bernardi, we associate to any pair (v,e) consisting of a vertex v and an
edge e adjacent to v a bijection between spanning trees of G and elements of
the set Pic^g(G) of degree g divisor classes on G, where g is the genus of G.
Using the natural action of the Picard group Pic^0(G) on Pic^g(G), we show that
the Bernardi bijection gives rise to a simply transitive action \beta_v of
Pic^0(G) on the set of spanning trees which does not depend on the choice of e.
  A plane graph has a natural ribbon structure (coming from the
counterclockwise orientation of the plane), and in this case we show that
\beta_v is independent of v as well. Thus for plane graphs, the set of spanning
trees is naturally a torsor for the Picard group. Conversely, we show that if
\beta_v is independent of v then G together with its ribbon structure is
planar. We also show that the natural action of Pic^0(G) on spanning trees of a
plane graph is compatible with planar duality.
  These findings are formally quite similar to results of Holroyd et al. and
Chan-Church-Grochow, who used rotor-routing to construct an action r_v of
Pic^0(G) on the spanning trees of a ribbon graph G, which they show is
independent of v if and only if G is planar. It is therefore natural to ask how
the two constructions are related. We prove that \beta_v = r_v for all vertices
v of G when G is a planar ribbon graph, i.e. the two torsor structures
(Bernardi and rotor-routing) on the set of spanning trees coincide. In
particular, it follows that the rotor-routing torsor is compatible with planar
duality. We conjecture that for every non-planar ribbon graph G, there exists a
vertex v with \beta_v \neq r_v.

including three main aspects: (1) It was believed that classifying topological
orders corresponds to classifying gapped quantum states. We show that such a
statement is not precise. We introduce the concept of \emph{gapped quantum
liquid} as a special kind of gapped quantum states that can ""dissolve"" any
product states on additional sites. Topologically ordered states actually
correspond to gapped quantum liquids with stable ground-state degeneracy.
Symmetry-breaking states for on-site symmetry are also gapped quantum liquids,
but with unstable ground-state degeneracy. (2) We point out that the
universality classes of generalized local unitary (gLU) transformations
(without any symmetry) contain both topologically ordered states and
symmetry-breaking states. This allows us to use a gLU invariant -- topological
entanglement entropy -- to probe the symmetry-breaking properties hidden in the
exact ground state of a finite system, which does not break any symmetry. This
method can probe symmetry- breaking orders even without knowing the symmetry
and the associated order parameters. (3) The universality classes of
topological orders and symmetry-breaking orders can be distinguished by
\emph{stochastic local (SL) transformations} (i.e.\ \emph{local invertible
transformations}): small SL transformations can convert the symmetry-breaking
classes to the trivial class of product states with finite probability of
success, while the topological-order classes are stable against any small SL
transformations, demonstrating a phenomenon of emergence of unitarity. This
allows us to give a new definition of long-range entanglement based on SL
transformations, under which only topologically ordered states are long-range
entangled.

is reduced to a first order differential equation by using the Laplace
transformation. Exact bound state solutions are obtained using convolution or
Faltungs theorem. The Ladder operators are also constructed for the Mie-type
potentials in N- dimensions. Lie algebra associated with these operators are
studied and it is found that they satisfy the commutation relations for the
SU(1,1) group.

Zilber's project on model theory of quantum mechanics
we study a way of building limit models from finite-dimensional approximations.
Our point of view is that of metric model theory, and we develop a method of
taking ultraproducts of unbounded operators. We first calculate the Feynman
propagator for the free particle as defined by physicists as an inner product
$\langle x_{0}| K^{t}| x_{1}\rangle $ of the eigenvector $| x_{0}\rangle $ of
the position operator with eigenvalue $x_{0}$ and $K^{t}(| x_{1}\rangle )$,
where $K^{t}$ is the time evolution operator. However, due to a discretising
effect, the eigenvector method does not work as expected, and without heavy
case-by-case scaling, it gives the wrong value. We look at this phenomenon, and
then complement this by showing how to instead calculate the kernel of the time
evolution operator (for both the free particle and the harmonic oscillator) in
the limit model. We believe that our method of calculating these is new.
