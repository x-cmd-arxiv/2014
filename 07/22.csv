Egan and Jingxin Zhang","Multichannel Compressive Sensing MRI Using Noiselet Encoding",,,"10.1371/journal.pone.0126386",,"physics.med-ph cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The incoherence between measurement and sparsifying transform matrices and
the restricted isometry property (RIP) of measurement matrix are two of the key
factors in determining the performance of compressive sensing (CS). In CS-MRI,
the randomly under-sampled Fourier matrix is used as the measurement matrix and
the wavelet transform is usually used as sparsifying transform matrix. However,
the incoherence between the randomly under-sampled Fourier matrix and the
wavelet matrix is not optimal, which can deteriorate the performance of CS-MRI.
Using the mathematical result that noiselets are maximally incoherent with
wavelets, this paper introduces the noiselet unitary bases as the measurement
matrix to improve the incoherence and RIP in CS-MRI, and presents a method to
design the pulse sequence for the noiselet encoding. This novel encoding scheme
is combined with the multichannel compressive sensing (MCS) framework to take
the advantage of multichannel data acquisition used in MRI scanners. An
empirical RIP analysis is presented to compare the multichannel noiselet and
multichannel Fourier measurement matrices in MCS. Simulations are presented in
the MCS framework to compare the performance of noiselet encoding
reconstructions and Fourier encoding reconstructions at different acceleration
factors. The comparisons indicate that multichannel noiselet measurement matrix
has better RIP than that of its Fourier counterpart, and that noiselet encoded
MCS-MRI outperforms Fourier encoded MCS-MRI in preserving image resolution and
can achieve higher acceleration factors. To demonstrate the feasibility of the
proposed noiselet encoding scheme, two pulse sequences with tailored spatially
selective RF excitation pulses was designed and implemented on a 3T scanner to
acquire the data in the noiselet domain from a phantom and a human brain.

CdSe nanocrystal quantum dots (NCQDs) we studied the dependence of the
time-resolved Faraday rotation signal on pump energy $E_p$ in a series of NCQD
samples with different sizes. In larger NCQDs, we observe two peaks in the spin
signal vs. $E_p$, whereas in smaller NQCDs, only a single peak is observed
before the signal falls to a low, broad plateau at higher energies. We
calculate the spin-dependent oscillator strengths of optical transitions using
a simple effective mass model to understand these results. The observed $E_p$
dependence of the spin pumping efficiency (SPE) arises from the competition
between the heavy hole (hh), light hole (lh) and split-off (so) band
contributions to transitions to the conduction band. The two latter
contributions lead to an electron spin polarization in the opposite direction
from the former. At lower $E_p$ the transitions are dominated by the hh band,
giving rise to the low energy peaks. At higher $E_p$, the increasing
contributions from the lh and so bands lead to a reduction in SPE. The
different number of peaks in larger and smaller NCQDs is attributed to
size-dependence of the ordering of the valence band states.

Online interactions have been interpreted as indicative of one social process

justification regarding the relation between observed data and theoretical
concept. Our research aims to breach this gap in computational social science
by proposing an unsupervised, parameter-free method to discover, with high
accuracy, the fundamental domains of interaction occurring in social networks.
By applying this method on two online datasets different by scope and type of
interaction (aNobii and Flickr) we observe the spontaneous emergence of three
domains of interaction representing the exchange of status, knowledge and
social support. By finding significant relations between the domains of
interaction and classic social network analysis issues (e.g., tie strength,
dyadic interaction over time) we show how the network of interactions induced
by the extracted domains can be used as a starting point for more nuanced
analysis of online social data that may one day incorporate the normative
grammar of social interaction. Our methods finds applications in online social
media services ranging from recommendation to visual link summarization.

the set $\mathcal{T}(a)$ of all points in $\mathcal{T}$ that are at distance
$a$ from the root. We know from Duquesne and Le Gall \cite{DuLG06} that for any
fixed $a\in (0, \infty)$, the measure $\ell^a$ that is induced on
$\mathcal{T}(a)$ by the local time at $a$ of the Brownian excursion, is equal,
up to a multiplicative constant, to the Hausdorff measure in $\mathcal{T}$ with
gauge function $g(r)= r \log\log1/r$, restricted to $\mathcal{T}(a)$. As
suggested by a result due to Perkins \cite{Per88,Per89} for super-Brownian

surely uniformly in $a$, and we specify the multiplicative constant. Namely, we
prove that almost surely for any $a\in (0, \infty)$, $\ell^a(\cdot) =
\frac{1}{2} \mathscr{H}_g (\, \cdot \, \cap \mathcal{T}(a))$, where

less well using a single set of parameters. To improve the inadequate fit, we
employed two photometric functions, the Shevchenko and Hapke functions. With
the Shevchenko function, we found that the magnitude-phase relation exhibits
linear behavior in a wide phase angle range (alpha = 5-75 deg) and shows weak
nonlinear opposition brightening at alpha< 5 deg, providing a more reliable
absolute magnitude of Hv = 19.25 +- 0.03. The phase slope (0.039 +- 0.001
mag/deg) and opposition effect amplitude (parameterized by the ratio of
intensity at alpha=0.3 deg to that at alpha=5 deg, I(0.3)/I(5)=1.31+-0.05) are
consistent with those of typical C-type asteroids. We also attempted to
determine the parameters for the Hapke model, which are applicable for
constructing the surface reflectance map with the Hayabusa 2 onboard cameras.
Although we could not constrain the full set of Hapke parameters, we obtained
possible values, w=0.041, g=-0.38, B0=1.43, and h=0.050, assuming a surface
roughness parameter theta=20 deg. By combining our photometric study with a

producing to a spectral peak near ~1-2 GeV (in $E^2 dN/dE$ units).
Additionally, while most globular clusters exhibit a similar spectral shape, we
identify a few with significantly softer spectra. We also determine the
gamma-ray luminosity function of millisecond pulsars using the population found
in the nearby field of the Milky Way, and within the globular cluster 47
Tucanae. We find that the gamma-ray emission observed from globular clusters is
dominated by a relatively small number of bright millisecond pulsars, and that
low-luminosity pulsars account for only a small fraction of the total flux. Our
results also suggest that the gamma-ray emission from millisecond pulsars is
more isotropic and less strongly beamed than the emission at X-ray wavelengths.
Furthermore, the observed distribution of apparent gamma-ray efficiencies
provides support for the slot gap or the outer gap models over those in which
the gamma-ray emission originates from regions close to the neutron star's
magnetic poles (polar cap models).

two spatially separated input-output devices gets manifested, solely, through
its \emph{nonlocal} behavior. Study of correlations based on this said feature
is commonly known as local-nonlocal paradigm. While in two-party scenario
correlations can be of only two types either local or nonlocal, the situation
gets more involved for multi-party scenario, \emph{e.g.,} for tripartite
scenario, correlations can be of three types: fully local, two-way local, and
genuinely nonlocal. Nonsignaling correlations having quantum realization are
termed physical. Fully local and certain quantum realizable two-way local
tripartite correlations always have a quantum realization with tripartite
biseparable states if there is no restriction on the local Hilbert-space
dimensions. In this work, we study the quantum simulation of fully local and
two-way local tripartite correlations with restricted local Hilbert-space
dimensions, in particular we consider
$\mathbb{C}^2\otimes\mathbb{C}^2\otimes\mathbb{C}^2$ quantum systems.
Interestingly, in this restricted simulation scenario we find that simulation
of certain fully local and two-way local correlations necessarily requires
\emph{genuine quantumness} in the three qubit states. This, going beyond the
standard nonlocality paradigm, captures a new notion of genuine nonclassicality
even in the fully local and two-way local correlations. To explore this newly
introduced notion of genuine nonclassicality, we propose two quantities of
interest, called \emph{Svetlichny strength} and \emph{Mermin strength}, and
extensively study their properties.

nets are the methods of choice for nonlinear learning problems. Or have we
simply not tried hard enough for kernel methods? Here we propose an approach
that scales up kernel methods using a novel concept called ""doubly stochastic

can be expressed as convex optimization problems, and we solve the problems by
making two unbiased stochastic approximations to the functional gradient, one
using random training points and another using random functions associated with
the kernel, and then descending using this noisy functional gradient. We show
that a function produced by this procedure after $t$ iterations converges to
the optimal function in the reproducing kernel Hilbert space in rate $O(1/t)$,
and achieves a generalization performance of $O(1/\sqrt{t})$. This doubly
stochasticity also allows us to avoid keeping the support vectors and to
implement the algorithm in a small memory footprint, which is linear in number
of iterations and independent of data dimension. Our approach can readily scale
kernel methods up to the regimes which are dominated by neural nets. We show
that our method can achieve competitive performance to neural nets in datasets

particle impenetrable core. Here, we used 12 blobs placed in the vertexes of an

not explicitly resolved, we show that the short-distance hydrodynamic responses

agree with spherical colloids and provide consistent effective radii. A
remarkable property of the present multiblob model is that it naturally
presents a ""divergent"" lubrication force at finite inter-particle distance.
This permits to resolve the large viscosity increase at dense colloidal volume
fractions. The intermediate resolution model is able to recover highly

limited relevance. A penalty like Total Variation (TV) that exploits the
natural 3D structure of the images can increase the spatial coherence of the
weight map. However, TV penalization leads to non-smooth optimization problems
that are hard to minimize. We propose an optimization framework that minimizes
any combination of l1, l2, and TV penalties while preserving the exact l1
penalty. This algorithm uses Nesterov's smoothing technique to approximate the
TV penalty with a smooth function such that the loss and the penalties are
minimized with an exact accelerated proximal gradient algorithm. We propose an
original continuation algorithm that uses successively smaller values of the
smoothing parameter to reach a prescribed precision while achieving the best
possible convergence rate. This algorithm can be used with other losses or

covariance formula $$\mathrm{Cov}\bigl[ (h, \phi_1), (h, \phi_2) \bigr] =
\int_{\mathbb R^d \times \mathbb R^d} -\log|y-z| \phi_1(y) \phi_2(z)dydz$$
which holds for mean-zero test functions $\phi_1, \phi_2$. The LGF belongs to
the larger family of fractional Gaussian fields obtained by applying fractional
powers of the Laplacian to a white noise $W$ on $\mathbb R^d$. It takes the
form $h = (-\Delta)^{-d/4} W$. By comparison, the Gaussian free field (GFF)
takes the form $(-\Delta)^{-1/2} W$ in any dimension. The LGFs with $d \in
\{2,1\}$ coincide with the 2D GFF and its restriction to a line. These objects
arise in the study of conformal field theory and SLE, random surfaces, random
matrices, Liouville quantum gravity, and (when $d=1$) finance. Higher
dimensional LGFs appear in models of turbulence and early-universe cosmology.
LGFs are closely related to cascade models and Gaussian branching random walks.
We review LGF approximation schemes, restriction properties, Markov properties,
conformal symmetries, and multiplicative chaos applications.

environmental history on quenching star formation in central and satellite
galaxies in the local Universe. We take advantage of publicly available galaxy
catalogues obtained from applying a galaxy formation model to the Millennium
simulation. In addition to halo mass, we consider the local density of galaxies
within various fixed scales. Comparing our model predictions to observational
data (SDSS), we demonstrate that the models are failing to reproduce the
observed density dependence of the quiescent galaxy fraction in several
aspects: for most of the stellar mass ranges and densities explored, models
cannot reproduce the observed similar behaviour of centrals and satellites,
they slightly under-estimate the quiescent fraction of centrals and
significantly over-estimate that of satellites. We show that in the models, the
density dependence of the quiescent central galaxies is caused by a fraction of
""backsplash"" centrals which have been satellites in the past (and were thus
suffering from environmental processes). Turning to satellite galaxies, the
density dependence of their quiescent fractions reflects a dependence on the
time spent orbiting within a parent halo of a particular mass, correlating
strongly with halo mass and distance from the halo centre. Comparisons with
observational estimates suggest relatively long gas consumption time scales of
roughly 5 Gyr in low mass satellite galaxies. The quenching time scales
decrease with increasing satellite stellar mass. Overall, a change in modelling
both internal processes (star formation and feedback) and environmental
processes (e.g. making them dependent on dynamical friction time-scales and
preventing the re-accretion of gas onto backsplash galaxies) is required for
improving currently used galaxy formation models.

black hole formation is controlled by the compactness of the stellar core at
the time of collapse. Low compactness stars are more likely to explode as
supernovae and produce neutron stars, while high compactness stars are more
likely to be failed supernovae that produce black holes with the mass of the
helium core of the star. Using three sequences of stellar models and
marginalizing over a model for the completeness of the black hole mass
function, we find that the compactness xi(2.5) above which 50% of core
collapses produce black holes is xi(2.5)=0.24 (0.15 < xi(2.5) < 0.37) at 90%
confidence). While models with a sharp transition between successful and failed
explosions are always the most likely, the width of the transition between the
minimum compactness for black hole formation and the compactness above which
all core collapses produce black holes is not well constrained. The models also
predict that f=0.18 (0.09 < f < 0.39) of core collapses fail assuming a minimum
mass for core collapse of 8Msun. We tested four other criteria for black hole
formation based on xi(2.0) and xi(3.0), the compactnesses at enclosed masses of
2.0 or 3.0 rather than 2.5Msun, the mass of the iron core, and the mass inside
the oxygen burning shell. We found that xi(2.0) works as well as xi(2.5), while
the compactness xi(3.0) works significantly worse, as does using the iron core
mass or the mass enclosed by the oxygen burning shell. As expected from the
high compactness of 20-25Msun stars, black hole formation in this mass range
provides a natural explanation of the red supergiant problem.

(SB) profiles of brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs) match well to observations.
On average, stars formed in galaxies accreted by the BCG account for ~90 per
cent of its total mass (the remainder is formed in situ). In circular
BCG-centred apertures, the superposition of multiple debris clouds (each ~10
per cent of the total BCG mass) from different progenitors can result in an
extensive outer diffuse component, qualitatively similar to a 'cD envelope'.
These clouds typically originate from tidal stripping at z < 1 and comprise
both streams and the extended envelopes of other massive galaxies in the
cluster. Stars at very low SB contribute a significant fraction of the total
cluster stellar mass budget: in the central 1 Mpc^2 of a z ~ 0.15 cluster
imaged at SDSS-like resolution, our fiducial model predicts 80-95 per cent of
stellar mass below a SB of mu_V = 26.5 mag arcsec^2 is associated with accreted

consistent on average with a Salpeter slope. Our study allows for a fully
consistent study of the trend between IMF and $\sigma$ for both the SLACS and

and electronic topological phases, we consider quantum-melting transitions of
{\it weak} quantum liquid crystals, a crystal and a nematic phase, in which
electrons form a quantum Hall state. In certain classes of Chern band
insulators and quantum Hall phases, it has been previously demonstrated that
there are topological Chern-Simons terms such as a Hall viscosity term and a
gravitational Chern-Simons term for local lattice deformations. The
Chern-Simons terms can induce anyonic statistics for the topological lattice
defects and furthermore dress the defects with certain symmetry quantum
numbers. On the other hand, the melting transitions of such liquid-crystalline
orders are driven by the condensation of lattice defects. Based on these
observations, we show how the topological terms can change the nature of the
proximate disordered phases of the quantum liquid crystalline phases. We derive
and study the effective dual field theories for the liquid crystalline phases
with the geometric Chern-Simons terms, and carefully examine the symmetry
quantum numbers and statistics of defects. We show that a crystal may go
through a continuous phase transition into another crystal with the new
discrete translational symmetries because the dislocation, the topological
defect in the crystal, carries non-zero crystal momentum due to the Hall
viscosity term. For the nematic phase, the disclination will condense at the
phase transition to the isotropic phase, and we show that the isotropic phase
may support a deconfined fractionally charged excitation due to the Wen-Zee
term, and thus the isotropic phase and the nematic phase have different
electromagnetic Hall responses.

galaxies from the McMaster Unbiased Galaxy Simulations (Stinson et al. 2010).
Accreted gas is bimodal with a natural temperature division at $10^5$ K, near
the peak of the cooling curve. Cold-mode accretion dominates inflows at early
times, creating a peak in total accretion at redshift z=2-4 and declining
exponentially below z$\sim$2. Hot-mode accretion peaks near z=1-2 and declines
gradually. Hot-mode exceeds cold-mode accretion at z$\sim$1.8 for all four
galaxies rather than when the galaxy reaches a characteristic mass. Cold-mode
accretion can fuel immediate star formation, while hot-mode accretion
preferentially builds a large, hot gas reservoir in the halo. Late-time star
formation relies on reservoir gas accreted 2-8 Gyr prior. Thus, the reservoir
allows the star formation rate to surpass the current overall gas accretion
rate. Stellar feedback cycles gas from the interstellar medium back into the
hot reservoir. Stronger feedback results in more gas cycling, gas removal in a
galactic outflow and less star formation overall, enabling simulations to match
the observed star formation history. For lower mass galaxies in particular,
strong feedback can delay the star formation peak to z=1-2 from the accretion
peak at z=2-4.

level. The spectral and timing evolution of IC10 X-1 are best explained by a
compact disk blackbody and an extended Comptonized component, where the thermal
component is completely absorbed and the Comptonized component is partially
covered during the dip. We consider three possibilities for the absorber: cold
material in the outer accretion disk, as is well documented for Galactic
neutron star (NS) XBs at high inclination; a stream of stellar wind that is
enhanced by traveling through the L1 point; and a spherical wind. We estimated
the corona radius (r_ADC) for IC10 X-1 from the dip ingress to be ~1 E+6 km,
assuming absorption from the outer disk, and found it to be consistent with the
relation between r_m ADC and 1--30 keV luminosity observed in Galactic NS XBs
that spans 2 orders of magnitude. For the other two scenarios, the corona would
be larger. Prior BH mass (M_BH) estimates range over 23--38 M_Sun, depending on
the inclination and WR mass. For disk absorption, the inclination, i, is likely
to be ~60--80 degrees, with M_BH ~24--41 M_Sun. Alternatively, the L1-enhanced
wind requires i ~80 degrees, suggesting ~24--33 M_Sun. For a spherical
absorber, i ~ 40 degrees, and M_BH ~50--65 M_Sun.

  Data Problems",,,,,"cs.AI cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In the big data era, scalability has become a crucial requirement for any
useful computational model. Probabilistic graphical models are very useful for
mining and discovering data insights, but they are not scalable enough to be
suitable for big data problems. Bayesian Networks particularly demonstrate this
limitation when their data is represented using few random variables while each
random variable has a massive set of values. With hierarchical data - data that
is arranged in a treelike structure with several levels - one would expect to
see hundreds of thousands or millions of values distributed over even just a
small number of levels. When modeling this kind of hierarchical data across
large data sets, Bayesian networks become infeasible for representing the
probability distributions for the following reasons: i) Each level represents a
single random variable with hundreds of thousands of values, ii) The number of
levels is usually small, so there are also few random variables, and iii) The
structure of the network is predefined since the dependency is modeled top-down
from each parent to each of its child nodes, so the network would contain a
single linear path for the random variables from each parent to each child
node. In this paper we present a scalable probabilistic graphical model to
overcome these limitations for massive hierarchical data. We believe the
proposed model will lead to an easily-scalable, more readable, and expressive
implementation for problems that require probabilistic-based solutions for
massive amounts of hierarchical data. We successfully applied this model to
solve two different challenging probabilistic-based problems on massive
hierarchical data sets for different domains, namely, bioinformatics and latent
semantic discovery over search logs.

that magnetic fields close to the blastwave are much stronger than would be
naively expected from simple shock compression of the field permeating the

on turbulence generation by cosmic-ray pressure gradients. Previously this
model was investigated using 2D MHD simulations.
  Motivated by the well-known qualitative differences between 2D and 3D
turbulence, we further our investigations of this model using both 2D and 3D
simulations to study the influence of the dimensionality of the simulations on
the field amplification achieved. Further, since the model implies the
formation of shocks which can, in principle, be efficiently cooled by
collisional cooling we include such cooling in our simulations to ascertain
whether it could increase the field amplification achieved. Finally, we examine
the influence of different orientations of the magnetic field with respect to
the normal of the blastwave.
  We find that dimensionality has a slight influence on the overall
amplification achieved, but a significant impact on the morphology of the
amplified field. Collisional cooling has surprisingly little impact, primarily
due to the short time which any element of the ISM resides in the precursor
region for supernova blastwaves. Even allowing for a wide range of orientations
of the magnetic field, we find that the magnetic field can be expected to be
amplified by, on average, at least an order of magnitude in the precursors of
supernova blastwaves.

an outstanding platform to study light matter interactions and realize
practical devices such as efficient light emitting diodes and nanolasers.
Despite progress in the growth and characterization of InGaN quantum dots,
their advantages as the gain medium in low threshold lasers have not been
clearly demonstrated. This work seeks to better understand the reasons for
these limitations by focusing on the simpler, limited-mode microdisk cavities,
and by carrying out comparisons of lasing dynamics in those cavities using
varying gain media including InGaN quantum wells, fragmented quantum wells, and
a combination of fragmented quantum wells with quantum dots. For each gain
medium, we utilize the distinctive, high quality (Q~5500) modes of the
cavities, and the change in the highest intensity mode as a function of pump
power to better understand the dominant radiative processes. The variations of
threshold power and lasing wavelength as a function of gain medium help us
identify the possible limitations to lower-threshold lasing with quantum dot
active medium. In addition, we have identified a distinctive lasing signature
for quantum dot materials, which consistently lase at wavelengths shorter than
the peak of the room temperature gain emission. These findings not only provide
better understanding of lasing in nitride-based quantum dot cavity systems, but
also shed insight into the more fundamental issues of light matter coupling in

obtain $b_1(z_{\rm eff})^{1.40}\sigma_8(z_{\rm eff})=1.672\pm 0.060$ and
$b_2^{0.30}(z_{\rm eff})\sigma_8(z_{\rm eff})=0.579\pm0.082$ at the effective
redshift of the survey, $z_{\rm eff}=0.57$. The main cosmological result is the
constraint on the combination $f^{0.43}(z_{\rm eff})\sigma_8(z_{\rm
eff})=0.582\pm0.084$, which is complementary to $f\sigma_8$ constraints
obtained from 2-point redshift space distortion analyses. A less conservative
analysis yields $f^{0.43}(z_{\rm eff})\sigma_8(z_{\rm eff})=0.584\pm0.051$. We
ensure that our result is robust by performing detailed systematic tests using
a large suite of survey galaxy mock catalogs and N-body simulations. The
constraints on $f^{0.43}\sigma_8$ are useful for setting additional constrains
on neutrino mass, gravity, curvature as well as the number of neutrino species
from galaxy surveys analyses (as presented in a companion paper).

Type II X-ray outbursts occur when a highly misaligned decretion disk around
the Be star becomes eccentric, allowing the compact object companion to capture
a large amount of material at periastron. Using 3D smoothed particle
hydrodynamics simulations we model the long term evolution of a representative
Be/X-ray binary system. We find that periodic (Type I) X-ray outbursts occur
when the neutron star is close to periastron for all disk inclinations. Type II
outbursts occur for large misalignment angles and are associated with
eccentricity growth that occurs on a timescale of about 10 orbital periods.
Mass capture from the eccentric decretion disk results in an accretion disk
around the neutron star whose estimated viscous time is long enough to explain
the extended duration of Type II outbursts. Previous studies suggested that the
outbursts are caused by a warped disk but our results suggest that this is not
sufficient, the disk must be both highly misaligned and eccentric to initiate a
Type II accretion event.

is whether a mean-field description is a reasonable starting point for
understanding experimental glass formers. Although the mean-field theory of the
glass transition -- like that of other statistical systems -- is exact when the
spatial dimension $d\rightarrow\infty$, the evolution of systems properties
with $d$ may not be smooth. Finite-dimensional effects could dramatically
change what happens in physical dimensions, $d=2,3$. For standard phase
transitions finite-dimensional effects are typically captured by
renormalization group methods, but for glasses the corrections are much more
subtle and only partially understood. Here, we investigate hopping between
localized cages formed by neighboring particles in a model that allows to
cleanly isolate that effect. By bringing together results from replica theory,
cavity reconstruction, void percolation, and molecular dynamics, we obtain
insights into how hopping induces a breakdown of the Stokes--Einstein relation
and modifies the mean-field scenario in experimental systems. Although hopping
is found to supersede the dynamical glass transition, it nonetheless leaves a
sizable part of the critical regime untouched. By providing a constructive
framework for identifying and quantifying the role of hopping, we thus take an
important step towards describing dynamic facilitation in the framework of the
mean-field theory of glasses.

flux conservation, (and, in the presence of dissipation, a controlled amount of

galactic discs, while numerical models of their origin and the typical
magnitudes are still absent. Previously, studies of galactic dynamo have
avoided considering the peripheries of galactic discs because of the very
limited (though gradually growing) knowledge about the local properties of the
interstellar medium. Here we investigate the possibility that magnetic fields
can be generated in the outskirts of discs, taking the Milky Way as an example.
We consider a simple evolving galactic dynamo model in the ""no-z"" formulation,
applicable to peripheral regions of galaxies, for various assumptions about the
radial and vertical profiles of the ionized gas disc. The magnetic field may
grow as galaxies evolve, even in the more remote parts of the galactic disc,
out to radii of 15 to 30 kpc, becoming substantial after times of about 10 Gyr.
This result depends weakly on the adopted distributions of the half thickness
and surface density of the ionized gas component. The model is robust to
changes in the amplitude of the initial field and the position of its maximum
strength. The magnetic field in the remote parts of the galactic disc could be
generated in situ from a seed field by local dynamo action. Another possibility
is field production in the central regions of a galaxy, followed by transport
to the disc's periphery by the joint action of the dynamo and turbulent
diffusivity. Our results demonstrate the possibilities for the appearance and
strengthening of magnetic fields at the peripheries of disc galaxies and
emphasize the need for observational tests with new and anticipated radio
telescopes (LOFAR, MWA, and SKA).

microwave background (CMB). We study this effect using a photon ray-tracing
code and a Galactic mass distribution with disk, bulge and halo components. For
an observer at the Sun's coordinates in the Galaxy, the bending of CMB photon
paths is limited to less than one arcsecond, and only for rays that pass within
a few degrees of the Galactic Center. However, the entire sky is affected,
resulting in global distortions of the CMB on large angular scales. These
distortions can cause the low-order multipoles of a spherical harmonic
expansion of the CMB sky temperature to leak into higher-order modes. Thus the
component of the CMB dipole that results from the Local Group's motion relative
to the local cosmic frame of rest contributes to higher-order moments for an
observer in the solar system. With our ray-tracing code we show that the
phenomenon is not sensitive to the specific choice of Galactic potential. We
also quantitatively rule it out as a contributor to CMB anomalies such as power
asymmetry or correlated alignment of low-order multipole moments.

1200 K to <300 K by chemically alloying it with MnFeGe results in a coupling of
the magnetic and structural transitions, leading to a large magnetocaloric
effect near room temperature. It was found that the magnetostructural
transition is highly sensitive to external (hydrostatic) pressure: relatively
low hydrostatic pressures (~2.4 kbar) lead to an extraordinary enhancement of
the isothermal entropy change from $-$\Delta $S$ = 44 to 89 J/kg K at ambient
(atmospheric) and 2.4 kbar applied pressures, respectively, for a field change
of \Delta $H$ = 5 T. This giant entropy change is associated with a large
relative volume change of about 7% induced by 2.4 kbar applied pressure during
the magnetostructural transition. The pressure-enhanced magnetocaloric effects
are accompanied by a shift in transition temperature, an effect that may be
exploited to tune the transition to the required working temperature, and
thereby eliminate the need for a given material to possess a large
magnetocaloric effect (i.e., entropy change) over a wide temperature range.
Furthermore, this material also possesses negligible hysteresis losses.

the dynamics and the steady-state behavior of the out-of-equilibrium double-dot
Aharonov Bohm interferometer, while considering different types of
interactions: Model I includes a closed interferometer with an inter-dot
electron-electron repulsion energy. In model II the interferometer is
interacting with a dissipative environment, possibly driven away from
equilibrium. In both cases we show that depending on the (horizontal, vertical)
mirror symmetries of the setup, nonlinear transport coefficients obey certain
magnetosymmetries. We compare numerically exact simulations to phenomenological
approaches: The behavior of model I is compared to self-consistent mean-field
calculations. Model II, allowing heat dissipation to a thermal bath, is
mimicked by an Aharonov Bohm junction with a voltage probe. In both cases we
find that phenomenological treatments capture the relevant transport
symmetries, yet significant deviations in magnitude may show up.

correlations between sets of times series. It was introduced by Sugihara et al.
and is reported to be ""a necessary condition for causation"" capable of
distinguishing causality from standard correlation. We show that the
relationships between CCM correlations proposed in \cite{Sugihara2012} do not,
in general, agree with intuitive concepts of ""driving"", and as such, should not
be considered indicative of causality. It is shown that CCM causality analysis
implies causality is a function of system parameters for simple linear and
nonlinear systems. For example, in a RL circuit, both voltage and current can
be identified as the driver depending on the frequency of the source voltage.
It is shown that CCM causality analysis can, however, be modified to identify
asymmetric relationships between pairs of time series that are consistent with
intuition for the considered example systems for which CCM causality analysis
provided non-intuitive driver identifications. This modification of the CCM
causality analysis is introduced as ""pairwise asymmetric inference"" (PAI) and
examples of its use are presented.

permutation groups, M and N, and produces an infinite group M [X] N which
carries many of the permutational properties of M. Under mild conditions on M
and N the group M [X] N is simple.
  As a permutational product, its most significant property is the following: M
[X] N is primitive if and only if M is primitive but not regular, and N is
transitive. Despite this remarkable similarity with the wreath product in
product action, M [X] N and M Wr N are thoroughly dissimilar. The product
provides a general way to build exotic examples of non-discrete, simple,
totally disconnected, locally compact, compactly generated topological groups
from discrete groups.
  We use this to solve a well-known open problem from topological group theory,
by obtaining the first construction of uncountably many pairwise non-isomorphic
simple topological groups that are totally disconnected, locally compact,
compactly generated and non-discrete. The groups we construct all contain the
same compact open subgroup.
  To build the product, we describe a group U(M,N) that acts on an
edge-transitive biregular tree T. This group has a natural universal property
and is analogous to the iconic universal group construction of M. Burger and S.
Mozes for locally finite regular trees.

scheme to offset the inconvenience that is experienced by an energy user (EU)
in trading its energy with an energy controller in smart grid. The main
objective is to encourage EUs with small distributed energy resources (DERs),
or with high sensitivity to their inconvenience, to take part in the energy
trading via providing incentive to them with relatively higher payment at the
same time as reducing the total cost to the energy controller. The proposed
scheme is modeled through a two-stage Stackelberg game that describes the
energy trading between a shared facility authority (SFA) and EUs in a smart
community. A suitable cost function is proposed for the SFA to leverage the
generation of discriminate pricing according to the inconvenience experienced
by each EU. It is shown that the game has a unique sub-game perfect equilibrium
(SPE), under the certain condition at which the SFA's total cost is minimized,
and that each EU receives its best utility according to its associated
inconvenience for the given price. A backward induction technique is used to
derive a closed form expression for the price function at SPE, and thus the
dependency of price on an EU's different decision parameters is explained for
the studied system. Numerical examples are provided to show the beneficial
properties of the proposed scheme.

impressions are allocated to advertisers such that the risk of ad network is
minimized. In practice, this translates to starting with an initial estimate of
dual prices and updating them according to the belief of the ad network toward
the future demand and remaining budgets. We apply our algorithms to a real data
set, and we empirically show that Kullback-Leibler divergence risk measure has
the best performance in terms of revenue and balanced budget delivery.

the use of signature-based methods for automated action instance approximation
to automatically reconstruct past user activities within a compromised or

user action may be detected using signature-based methods during a post-mortem
digital forensic analysis. A system is formally defined as a set of objects,
where a subset of objects may be altered on the occurrence of an action. A
novel action-trace update time threshold is proposed that enables objects to be
categorized by their respective update patterns over time. By integrating time
into event reconstruction, the most recent action instance approximation as
well as limited past instances of the action may be differentiated and their
time values approximated. After the formal theory if signature-based event
reconstruction is defined, a case study is given to evaluate the practicality
of the proposed method.

hence interfere with each other. We assume that the users are concentrated at
certain areas in the cell, i.e., they form hotspots. While some of the hotspots
are assumed to have a small cell in their vicinity, the others are directly
served by the macrocell. Due to a relatively small area of each hotspot, the
users lying in a particular hotspot appear to be almost co-located to the
macrocells, which are typically deployed at some elevation. Assuming large
number of antennas at the macrocell, we exploit this directionality in the
channel vectors to obtain spatial blanking, i.e., concentrating transmission
energy only in certain directions while creating transmission opportunities for
the small cells lying in the other directions. In addition to this inherent
interference suppression, we also develop three low-complexity interference
coordination strategies: (i) turn off small cells based on the amount of
cross-tier interference they receive or cause to the scheduled macrocell
hotspots, (ii) schedule hotspots such that treating interference as noise is
approximately optimal for the resulting Gaussian interference channel, and
(iii) offload some of the macrocell hotspots to nearby small cells in order to
improve throughput fairness across all hotspots. For all these schemes, we
study the relative merits and demerits of uniform deployment of small cells vs.
deploying more small cells towards the cell center or the cell edge.

incorporating correlation effects is delineated. In this way, doping and
temperature dependent spectra, from the undoped insulator to the overdoped

both weak and strong coupling can be modeled in a material-specific manner with
very few parameters. Efficacy of the model is shown by considering available

variations in the absorption-line profiles over the 37 days sampled by our

detected reveal that the ISM of M82 probed by SN 2014J consists of a mixture of
diffuse atomic and molecular clouds characterized by a wide range of
physical/environmental conditions. Decreasing N(Na I)/N(Ca II) ratios and
increasing N(Ca I)/N(K I) ratios with increasing velocity are indicative of
reduced depletion in the higher-velocity material. Significant
component-to-component scatter in the N(Na I)/N(Ca II) and N(Ca I)/N(Ca II)
ratios may be due to variations in the local ionization conditions. An apparent
anti-correlation between the N(CH+)/N(CH) and N(Ca I)/N(Ca II) ratios can be
understood in terms of an opposite dependence on gas density and radiation
field strength, while the overall high CH+ abundance may be indicative of
enhanced turbulence in the ISM of M82. The Li abundance also seems to be
enhanced in M82, which supports the conclusions of recent gamma-ray emission
studies that the cosmic-ray acceleration processes are greatly enhanced in this

trends as well as projected 2D metallicity maps. The setup combines high mass
resolution N-body simulations with the semi-analytical galaxy formation model
Galacticus for consistent treatment of the subgrid physics (such as galactic
winds and ram-pressure stripping) in the cosmological hydrodynamical
simulations. The interface between Galacticus and the hydro simulation of the
ICM with FLASH is discussed with respect to observations of star formation rate
histories, radial star formation trends in galaxy clusters, and the metallicity
at different redshifts. As a test for the robustness of the wind model, we
compare three prescriptions from different approaches. For the wind model
directly taken from Galacticus, we find mean ICM metallicities between 0.2 -
0.8Z within the inner 1Mpc at z = 0. The main contribution to the metal mass
fraction comes from galactic winds. The outflows are efficiently mixed in the
ICM, leading to a steady homogenization of metallicities until ram-pressure
stripping becomes effective at low redshifts. We find a very peculiar and yet
common drop in metal mass fractions within the inner ~200kpc of the cool cores,
which is due to a combination of wind suppression by outer pressure within our
model and a lack of mixing after the formation of these dense regions.

detailed analysis of these interesting systems, combining the two observational
techniques: interferometry and apparent period variation, was performed. The
interferometric data for these three systems obtained during the last century
determine the visual orbits of the distant components in the systems. The
combined analysis of the positional measurements together with the analysis of
apparent period changes of the eclipsing binary (using the minima timings) can
be used to study these systems in a combined approach, resulting in a set of
parameters otherwise unobtainable without the radial velocities. The main
advantage of the technique presented here is the fact that one needs no
spectroscopic monitoring of the visual orbits, which have rather long periods:
5.5 yr for V819 Her, 9.0 yr for V2388 Oph, and 31.3 yr for V1031 Ori,
respectively. The eccentricities of the outer orbits are 0.69, 0.33, and 0.92,
respectively. Moreover, the use of minima timings of the eclipsing pairs help
us to derive the orientation of the orbit in space with no ambiguity around the
celestial plane. And finally, the combined analysis yielded also an independent
determination of the distance of V819 Her (68.7 +/- 1.8 pc), and V2388 Oph

techniques, namely, large-scale (LS) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) and
network MIMO. We consider a cooperative wireless cellular system operating in
time-division duplex (TDD) mode, wherein each cooperating cluster includes $B$
base-stations (BSs), each equipped with multiple antennas and scheduling $K$
single-antenna users. In an LS-MIMO system, each BS employs $BM$ antennas not
only to serve its scheduled users, but also to null out interference caused to
the other users within the cooperating cluster using zero-forcing (ZF)
beamforming. In a network MIMO system, each BS is equipped with only $M$
antennas, but interference cancellation is realized by data and channel state
information exchange over the backhaul links and joint downlink transmission
using ZF beamforming. Both systems are able to completely eliminate
intra-cluster interference and to provide the same number of spatial degrees of
freedom per user. Assuming the uplink-downlink channel reciprocity provided by
TDD, both systems are subject to identical channel acquisition overhead during
the uplink pilot transmission stage. Further, the available sum power at each
cluster is fixed and assumed to be equally distributed across the downlink
beams in both systems. Building upon the channel distribution functions and
using tools from stochastic ordering, this paper shows, however, that from a
performance point of view, users experience better quality of service, averaged
over small-scale fading, under an LS-MIMO system than a network MIMO system.
Numerical simulations for a multicell network reveal that this conclusion also
holds true with regularized ZF beamforming scheme. Hence, given the likely
lower cost of adding excess number of antennas at each BS, LS-MIMO could be the
preferred route toward interference mitigation in cellular networks.

previous studies have employed the Bures fidelity or the Hilbert-Schmidt norm
as the figure of merit to characterize the quality of the corresponding cloning
scenarios. However, in many situations, what we truly care about is the
relevant information about certain parameters encoded in quantum states. In
this work, we investigate the multiple phase estimation problem in the
framework of quantum cloning machines, from the perspective of quantum Fisher
information matrix (QFIM). Focusing on the generalized d-dimensional equatorial
states, we obtain the analytical formulas of QFIM for both universal quantum
cloning machine (UQCM) and phase-covariant quantum cloning machine (PQCM), and
prove that PQCM indeed performs better than UQCM in terms of QFIM. We highlight
that our method can be generalized to arbitrary cloning schemes where the
fidelity between the single-copy input and output states is input-state
independent. Furthermore, the attainability of the quantum Cramer-Rao bound is
also explicitly discussed.

with the following improvements over the original: (i) Each heap is represented
by a single heap-ordered tree, instead of a set of trees. (ii) Each
decrease-key operation does only one cut and a cascade of rank changes, instead
of doing a cascade of cuts. (iii) The outcomes of all comparisons done by the
algorithm are explicitly represented in the data structure, so none are wasted.
We also give an example to show that without cascading cuts or rank changes,
both the original data structure and the new version fail to have the desired
efficiency, solving an open problem of Fredman. Finally, we illustrate the
richness of the design space by proposing several alternative ways to do
cascading rank changes, including a randomized strategy related to one
previously proposed by Karger. We leave the analysis of these alternatives as
intriguing open problems.

archetype of a three-dimensional photonic crystal. Here, we describe the optics
of an opal using a flexible model based upon a stratified medium whose
(effective) index is governed by the opal density in a small planar slice of
the opal. We take into account the effect of the substrate and assume a well-
controlled number of layers, as it occurs for an opal fabricated by
Langmuir-Blodgett deposition. The calculations are performed with transfer
matrices, and an absorptive component in the effective index is introduced to
account for the light scattering. This one-dimensional formalism allows
quantitative predictions for reflection and transmission, notably as a function
of the ratio between the irradiation wavelength and the sphere diameter, or as
a function of the incidence angle or of the polarization. It can be used for an
irradiation from the substrate side or from the vacuum side and can account for
defect layers. The interface region between the opal and the substrate (or
vacuum) is shown to have a strong influence, regardless of the exact opal
structure. This break in the periodicity at the interface is a general, but
often ignored feature, of any external coupling to a photonic crystal. Our
calculations provide also the main features of the Bragg peak for reflection,
including its width and strength. Comparisons of this versatile model with
experiments show that despite its simplicity, it is powerful enough to explain
numerous observations.

nonlinear cavity can be changed, in the steady-state limit, into a partially
incoherent superposition of only the vacuum and the single-photon states. This
effect is known as single-photon blockade, which is usually analyzed for a
Kerr-type nonlinear cavity parametrically driven by a single-photon process
assuming single-photon loss mechanisms. We study photon blockade engineering
via a squeezed reservoir, i.e., a quantum reservoir, where only two-photon
absorption is allowed. Namely, we analyze a lossy nonlinear cavity
parametrically driven by a two-photon process and allowing two-photon loss
mechanisms, as described by the master equation derived for a two-photon
absorbing reservoir. The nonlinear cavity engineering can be realized by a
linear cavity with a tunable two-level system via the Jaynes-Cummings
interaction in the dispersive limit. We show that by tuning properly the
frequencies of the driving field and the two-level system, the steady state of
the cavity field can be the single-photon Fock state or a partially incoherent
superposition of several Fock states with photon numbers, e.g., (0,2), (1,3),
(0,1,2), or (0,2,4). We observe that an arbitrary initial coherent or
incoherent superposition of Fock states with an even (odd) number of photons
can be changed into a partially incoherent superposition of a few Fock states
of the same photon-number parity. A general solution for an arbitrary initial
state is a weighted mixture of the above two solutions with even and odd photon
numbers, where the weights are given by the probabilities of measuring the even
and odd numbers of photons of the initial cavity field, respectively. Thus, in
contrast to the standard photon blockade, we prove that the steady state in the
engineered photon blockade, can depend on its initial state.

that cannot be calculated with sufficient accuracy for high quantum levels ($n
\gtrsim 50$) by standard machine-precision methods. Methods to overcome the
accuracy problem have been developed, which include asymptotic expansions and
recursion relations. These methods, used in astrophysical models to calculate

per cent. Detections of radio recombination lines with the new Low Frequency

for transitions up to quantum level $n=2000$, sufficient to model low frequency
Carbon radio recombination lines. The calculations provide a relative error of

compatible with several indirect estimates from other methods (the UV slope,
extrapolation of the attenuation measured from the IR/UV ratio at lower
redshift, and SED fits), and the dust-to-stellar mass ratio is not incompatible
with that of galaxies from z=0 to 3. For their stellar mass the high-z galaxies
studied here have an attenuation below the one expected from the mean relation
of low redshift (z<1.5) galaxies. More and deeper (sub)-mm data are clearly
needed to directly determine the UV attenuation and dust content of the
dominant population of high-z star-forming galaxies and to establish more
firmly their dependence on stellar mass, redshift, and other properties.

of several investigations. However, its impact on the chemical evolution of the
Milky Way still needs to be fully quantified. In this paper, we aim at imposing
some constraints on the significance of this phenomenon by considering its
influence on the chemical evolution of the Milky Way thin disc. We do not
investigate the physical mechanisms underlying the migration of stars. Rather,
we introduce a simple, heuristic treatment of stellar migration in a detailed
chemical evolution model for the thin disc of the Milky Way, which already
includes radial gas flows and reproduces several observational constraints for
the solar vicinity and the whole Galactic disc. When stellar migration is
implemented according to the results of chemo-dynamical simulations by Minchev
et. al. (2013) and finite stellar velocities of 1 km s$^{-1}$ are taken into
account, the high-metallicity tail of the metallicity distribution function of
long-lived thin-disc stars is well reproduced. By exploring the velocity space,
we find that the migrating stars must travel with velocities in the range 0.5
-2 km s$^{-1}$ to properly reproduce the high-metallicity tail of the
metallicity distribution. We confirm previous findings by other authors that
the observed spread in the age-metallicity relation of solar neighbourhood
stars can be explained by the presence of stars which originated at different
Galactocentric distances, and we conclude that the chemical properties of stars
currently observed in the solar vicinity do suggest that stellar migration is
present to some extent.

superconductors is one of the most interesting topics in unconventional
superconductivity. The enhancement of effective mass and the induced
ferromagnetic fluctuations play key roles for reentrant superconductivity.
However, the associated change of the Fermi surface, which is often observed at
(pseudo-) metamagnetic transition, can also be a key ingredient. In order to
study the Fermi surface instability, we performed Hall effect measurements in
the ferromagnetic superconductor URhGe. The Hall effect of URhGe is well
explained by two contributions, namely by the normal Hall effect and by the
large anomalous Hall effect due to skew scattering. The large change in the
Hall coefficient is observed at low fields between the paramagnetic and
ferromagnetic states for H // c-axis (easy-magnetization axis) in the
orthorhombic structure, indicating that the Fermi surface is reconstructed in
the ferromagnetic state below the Curie temperature (T_Curie=9.5K). At low
temperatures (T << T_Curie), when the field is applied along the b-axis, the
reentrant superconductivity was observed in both the Hall resistivity and the
magnetoresistance below 0.4K. Above 0.4K, a large jump with the first-order
nature was detected in the Hall resistivity at a spin-reorientation field H_R ~
12.5T, demonstrating that the marked change of the Fermi surface occurs between
the ferromagnetic state and the polarized state above H_R. The results can be
understood by the Lifshitz-type transition, induced by the magnetic field or by
the change of the effective magnetic field.

distribution, and physical conditions in molecular clouds is a highly
degenerate problem. Aims. The coreshine phenomenon, a scattering process at 3.6
and 4.5 $\mu$m that dominates absorption, has revealed its ability to explore
the densest parts of clouds. We want to use this effect to constrain the dust
parameters. The goal is to investigate to what extent grain growth (at constant
dust mass) inside molecular clouds is able to explain the coreshine
observations. We aim to find dust models that can explain a sample of Spitzer
coreshine data. We also look at the consistency with near-infrared data we
obtained for a few clouds. Methods. We selected four regions with a very high
occurrence of coreshine cases: Taurus-Perseus, Cepheus, Chameleon and
L183/L134. We built a grid of dust models and investigated the key parameters
to reproduce the general trend of surface bright- nesses and intensity ratios
of both coreshine and near-infrared observations with the help of a 3D
Monte-Carlo radiative transfer code. The grid parameters allow to investigate
the effect of coagulation upon spherical grains up to 5 $\mu$m in size derived
from the DustEm diffuse interstellar medium grains. Fluffiness (porosity or
fractal degree), ices, and a handful of classical grain size distributions were
also tested. We used the near- and mostly mid-infrared intensity ratios as
strong discriminants between dust models. Results. The determination of the
background field intensity at each wavelength is a key issue. In particular, an
especially strong background field explains why we do not see coreshine in the
Galactic plane at 3.6 and 4.5 $\mu$m. For starless cores, where detected, the
observed 4.5 $\mu$m / 3.6 $\mu$m coreshine intensity ratio is always lower than
$\sim$0.5 which is also what we find in the models for the Taurus-Perseus and
L183 directions. Embedded sources can lead to higher fluxes (up to four times
greater than the strongest starless core fluxes) and higher coreshine ratios
(from 0.5 to 1.1 in our selected sample). Normal interstellar radiation field
conditions are sufficient to find suitable grain models at all wavelengths for
starless cores. The standard interstellar grains are not able to reproduce
observations and, due to the multi-wavelength approach, only a few grain types
meet the criteria set by the data. Porosity does not affect the flux ratios
while the fractal dimension helps to explain coreshine ratios but does not seem
able to reproduce near-infrared observations without a mix of other grain
types. Conclusions. Combined near- and mid-infrared wavelengths confirm the
potential to reveal the nature and size distribution of dust grains. Careful
assessment of the environmental parameters (interstellar and background fields,
embedded or nearby reddened sources) is required to validate this new
diagnostic.

very rich and complicated. For the ground states, we establish the existence

center-of-mass is either non-periodic or with different frequency to the
trapping frequency when the external trapping potential is taken as harmonic

shift, which is completely different from the case of a two-component BEC
without the SO coupling, and obtain the semiclassical limit of the CGPEs in the

is determined by one crucial design parameter. The main contribution is a
methodology to approximately calculate all solutions up to a certain tolerance

called the regularization path in sparse estimation and is a very important
tool in order to find the appropriate balance between fit and complexity. We
extend this to the more complicated nuclear norm case. The key idea is to
determine when to exactly calculate the optimal solution using an upper bound

optimization problems the whole regularization path up to a given tolerance can
be efficiently computed. We illustrate this approach on some numerical

single-ladder-splitting contribution to double parton scattering (DPS)
production of two S- or P-wave quarkonia, two Higgs bosons and $c \bar c c \bar

discussed as a function of centre-of-mass energy, mass of the produced system

conventional two-parton distribution on transverse parton separation (Gaussian
and independent of $x_i$ and scales), we find that the 2v1 contribution is as
big as the 2v2 contribution discussed in recent years in the literature. This
means that the phenomenological analyses of $\sigma_{eff}$ including only the
conventional DPS mechanism have to be revised including explicitly the
single-ladder-splitting contributions discussed here. The differential
distributions in rapidity and transverse momenta calculated for conventional
and single-ladder-splitting DPS processes are however very similar which causes
their experimental separation to be rather difficult, if not impossible. The
direct consequence of the existence of the two components (conventional and

$\sigma_{eff}$. This is illustrated in our paper for the considered processes.

Decision Theory (QDT) that we have developed in a series of publications since

using the point of view of psychological and cognitive sciences, without
touching physiological aspects. The basic principles of how intelligence acts
are discussed. The human brain processes involved in decisions are argued to be
principally different from straightforward computer operations. The difference
lies in the conscious-subconscious duality of the decision making process and
the role of emotions that compete with utility optimization. The most general
approach for characterizing the process of decision making, taking into account
the conscious-subconscious duality, uses the framework of functional analysis
in Hilbert spaces, similarly to that used in the quantum theory of
measurements. This does not imply that the brain is a quantum system, but just
allows for the simplest and most general extension of classical decision
theory. The resulting theory of quantum decision making, based on the rules of
quantum measurements, solves all paradoxes of classical decision making,
allowing for quantitative predictions that are in excellent agreement with
experiments. Finally, we provide a novel application by comparing the
predictions of QDT with experiments on the prisoner dilemma game. The developed
theory can serve as a guide for creating artificial intelligence acting by
quantum rules.

stars. On the observed spectrum of M dwarf, the continuum is depressed by the
numerous weak lines of H2O and only the depressed continuum or the pseudo-
continuum can be seen. On the theoretical spectrum of M dwarfs, we find that
the pseudo-continuum can be evaluated accurately thanks to the recent H2O line
database. Then quantitative analysis of the spectrum of M dwarf can be done by
referring to the pseudo-continua both on the observed and theoretical spectra.
Since the basic principle of the spectroscopic analysis should be the same
whether the true- or pseudo-continuum is referred to, the difficulty related to
the continuum in cool stars can in principle be overcome. Then, the numerous CO
lines can be excellent abundance indicators of carbon, since almost all the
carbon atoms are in stable CO molecules whose abundance remains almost
unchanged for the changes of physical condition in the photosphere and,
somewhat unexpectedly, carbon abundances in late-type stars can best be
determined in M dwarfs rather than in solar type stars. The resulting C/Fe
ratios for most M dwarfs are nearly constant at about the solar value based on
the classical high carbon abundance rather than on the recently revised lower
value. This result implies that the solar carbon abundance is atypical for its
metallicity among the stellar objects in the solar neighborhood if the downward
revised solar carbon abundance is correct.

generalized eigenvalues of two appropriately chosen random matrices, mapped to
the surface of the sphere by stereographic projection. This model can be
considered as a spherical analogue for other random matrix models on the unit

ensemble, and is one of the most natural constructions of a (statistically)
rotation invariant point process with repelling property on the sphere. In this
paper we study the spherical ensemble and its local repelling property by
investigating the minimum spacing between the points and the area of the
largest empty cap. Moreover, we consider this process as a way of distributing
points uniformly on the sphere. To this aim, we study two ""metrics"" to measure
the uniformity of an arrangement of points on the sphere. For each of these
metrics (discrepancy and Riesz energies) we obtain some bounds and investigate
the asymptotic behavior when the number of points tends to infinity. It is
remarkable that though the model is random, because of the repelling property
of the points, the behavior can be proved to be as good as the best known
constructions (for discrepancy) or even better than the best known

revealed dust grains in molecular cores with sizes larger than commonly
inferred for the diffuse interstellar medium. It is currently unclear whether
these grains are grown within the molecular cores or are an ubiquitous
component of the interstellar medium. Aims: We investigate whether the large
grains necessary for efficient scattering at 1-5 mum are associated with the
abundance of water-ice within molecular clouds and cores. Methods: We combined
water-ice abundance measurements for sight lines through the Lupus IV molecular
cloud complex with measurements of the scattered light at 3.6 mum for the same
sight lines. Results: We find that there is a similar threshold for the cores
in emission in scattered light at 3.6 mum (tau_9.7=0.15pm0.05, A_K=0.4pm0.2 as
water-ice (tau_9.7=0.11pm0.01, A_K=0.19pm0.04) and that the scattering
efficiency increases as the relative water-ice abundance increases. The ice
layer increases the average grain size, which again strongly increases the
albedo. Conclusions: The higher scattering efficiency is partly due to layering
of ice on the dust grains. Although the layer can be relatively thin it can
enhance the scattering substantially.

investigations based on single-metric truncations there is a tension between
this requirement and the condition of Asymptotic Safety since the former
(latter) requires a positive (negative) anomalous dimension of Newton's
constant. We show that the problem disappears using the bi-metric
renormalization group flows that became available recently: They admit an
asymptotically safe UV limit and, at the same time, a genuine semi-classical
regime with a positive anomalous dimension. This brings the gravitons of QEG on
a par with arbitrary (standard model, etc.) particles which exist as asymptotic
states. We also argue that metric perturbations on almost Planckian scales
might not be propagating, and we propose an interpretation as a form of `dark

secondary mirror and a mid-high layer wavefront sensor that drives a Xinetics
349 actuator DM conjugated to an altitude of 7.1 km. When the LINC-NIRVANA MCAO
system is commissioned, it will be one of only two such systems on an 8-meter
telescope and the only such system in the northern hemisphere. In order to
mitigate risk, we take a modular approach to commissioning by decoupling and
testing the LINC-NIRVANA subsystems individually. The Pathfinder is the
ground-layer wavefront sensor for the DX eye of the LBT. It uses 12 pyramid
wavefront sensors to optically co-add light from natural guide stars in order
to make four pupil images that sense ground layer turbulence. Pathfinder is now
the first LINC-NIRVANA subsystem to be fully integrated with the telescope and
commissioned on sky. Our 2013 commissioning campaign consisted of 7 runs at the
LBT with the tasks of assembly, integration and communication with the LBT
telescope control system, alignment to the telescope optical axis, off-sky
closed loop AO calibration, and finally closed loop on-sky AO. We present the
programmatics of this campaign, along with the novel designs of our alignment
scheme and our off-sky calibration test, which lead to the Pathfinder's first
on-sky closed loop images.

Still, they are objects that hold crucial information for probing the chemical
evolution of these regions of the Milky Way. We aim at increasing the number of
old open clusters in the inner disc for which high-resolution metal abundances
are available. Here we report on NGC 4337, which was recently discovered to be
an old, inner disc open cluster. We present the very first high-resolution
spectroscopy of seven clump stars that are all cluster members. We performed a
detailed abundance analysis for them. We find that NGC 4337 is marginally more
metal-rich than the Sun, with [Fe/H]=+0.12$\pm$0.05. The abundance ratios of
$\alpha$-elements are generally solar. At odds with recent studies on
intermediate-age and old open clusters in the Galactic disc, Ba is
under-abundant in NGC 4337 compared with the Sun. Our analysis of the iron-peak
elements (Cr and Ni) does not reveal anything anomalous. Based on these
results, we estimate the cluster age to be 1.6$^{+0.1}_{-0.1}$ Gyr, and derive
a reddening E(B-V)=0.23$\pm$0.05, and an apparent distance modulus
$(m-M)_{V}=12.80\pm0.15$. Its distance to the Galactic centre is 7.6 kpc. With
this distance and metallicity, NGC 4337 fits the metallicity gradient for the
inner Galactic disc fairly well. The age and metallicity we measured make NGC
4337 a twin of the well-known old open cluster NGC 752. The red clumps of these
two clusters bear an amazing resemblance. But the main sequence of NGC 752 is
significantly more depleted in stars than that of NGC 4337. This would mean
that NGC 752 is in a much more advanced dynamical stage, being on the verge of
dissolving into the general Galactic field. Our results make NGC 4337 an
extremely interesting object for further studies of stellar evolution in the
critical turn-off mass range 1.1-1.4 solar masses.

described by nonlinear stochastic differential equations and discrete-time
measurements. Gaussian approximations are a computationally efficient way to
approximate the true smoothing distribution. In this work, we present a
comparison between two Gaussian approximation methods. The Gaussian filtering
based Gaussian smoother uses a Gaussian approximation for the filtering
distribution to form an approximation for the smoothing distribution. The
variational Gaussian smoother is based on minimizing the Kullback-Leibler
divergence of the approximate smoothing distribution with respect to the true
distribution. The results suggest that for highly nonlinear systems, the
variational Gaussian smoother can be used to iteratively improve the Gaussian
filtering based smoothing solution. We also present linearization and
sigma-point methods to approximate the intractable Gaussian expectations in the
Variational Gaussian smoothing equations. In addition, we extend the
variational Gaussian smoother for certain class of systems with singular
diffusion matrix.

evolution of the magnetic field in the upper crust, driven by electron MHD
(EMHD) flows, twists the external magnetic flux tubes, producing persistent
emission, bursts and flares. At the same time the neutron star crust
plastically relieves the imposed magnetic field stress, limiting the strain $
\epsilon_t $ to values well below the critical strain $ \epsilon_{crit}$ of a
brittle fracture, $ \epsilon_t \sim 10^{-2}\epsilon_{crit} $.
  Magnetar-like behavior, occurring near the magnetic equator, takes place in
all neutron stars, but to a different extent. The persistent luminosity is
proportional to cubic power of the magnetic field (at a given age), and hence
is hardly observable in most rotationally powered neutron stars. Giant flares
can occur only if the magnetic field exceeds some threshold value, while
smaller bursts and flares may take place in relatively small magnetic fields.
  Bursts and flares are magnetospheric reconnection events that launch Alfven
shocks which convert into high frequency whistlers upon hitting the neutron
star surface. The resulting whistler pulse induces a strain that increases with
depth both due to the increasing electron density (and the resulting slowing of
the waves), and due to the increasing coherence of a whistler pulse with depth.
The whistler pulse is dissipated on a time scale of approximately a day at
shallow depths corresponding to $\rho \sim 10^{10} {\rm g cm}^{-3}$; this
energy is detected as enhanced post-flare surface emission.

conductivity of GPnC to thermal conductivity of graphene can be changed from
0.1 to 0.01 when the porosity is changed from about 21% to 65%. The phonon
participation ratio spectra reveal that more phonon modes are localized in
GPnCs with larger porosity. Our results suggest that creating GPnCs is a
valuable method to efficiently manipulate the thermal conductivity of graphene.

idea of the Fermi surface reconstruction via charge ordering. The longstanding
issue of the origin of the negative Hall coefficient in YBCO and Hg1201 at low

independent, while the mobility of holes scattered by the short-wavelength

that the reference prior for the parameter of interest (the signal intensity)
can be well approximated by the widely (ab)used flat prior only when the
expected background is very high. On the other hand, a very simple
approximation (the limiting form of the reference prior for perfect prior
background knowledge) can be safely used over a large portion of the background
parameters space. The resulting approximate reference posterior is a Gamma
density whose parameters are related to the observed counts. This limiting form
is simpler than the result obtained with a flat prior, with the additional
advantage of representing a much closer approximation to the reference
posterior in all cases. Hence such limiting prior should be considered a better
default or conventional prior than the uniform prior. On the computing side, it
is shown that a 2-parameter fitting function is able to reproduce extremely
well the reference prior for any background prior. Thus, it can be useful in
applications requiring the evaluation of the reference prior for a very large

to determine the rate and find that Classical Nucleation Theory (CNT) predicts
the rate quite well, even when employing simple modelling of crystallite shape,
chemical potential, surface tension and particle attachment rate, down to the
temperature where the droplet loses metastability and crystallization proceeds
through growth-limited nucleation in an unequilibrated liquid. Below this
crossover temperature, the nucleation rate is still predicted when MC
simulations are used to directly calculate quantities required by CNT.
Discrepancy in critical embryo sizes obtained from MD and MC arises when
twinned structures with five-fold symmetry provide a competing free energy
pathway out of the critical region. We find that crystallization begins with
hcp-fcc stacked precritical nuclei and differentiation to various end
structures occurs when these embryos become critical. We confirm that using the
largest embryo in the system as a reaction coordinate is useful in determining
the onset of growth-limited nucleation and show that it gives the same free
energy barriers as the full cluster size distribution once the proper reference
state is identified. We find that the bulk melting temperature controls the
rate, even though the solid-liquid coexistence temperature for the droplet is
significantly lower. The value of surface tension that renders close agreement
between CNT and direct rate determination is significantly lower than what is
expected for the bulk system.

dynamics (ImQMD) model, the energy dependences of the nucleus-nucleus
potential, the friction parameter, and the random force characterizing a
one-dimensional Langevin-type description of the heavy-ion fusion process are
investigated. Systematic calculations with the ImQMD model show that the
fluctuation-dissipation relation found in the symmetric head-on fusion
reactions at energies just above the Coulomb barrier fades out when the
incident energy increases. It turns out that this dynamical change with
increasing incident energy is caused by a specific behavior of the friction
parameter which directly depends on the microscopic dynamical process, i.e., on
how the collective energy of the relative motion is transferred into the
intrinsic excitation energy. It is shown microscopically that the energy
dissipation in the fusion process is governed by two mechanisms: One is caused
by the nucleon exchanges between two fusing nuclei, and the other is due to a
rearrangement of nucleons in the intrinsic system. The former mechanism
monotonically increases the dissipative energy and shows a weak dependence on
the incident energy, while the latter depends on both the relative distance
between two fusing nuclei and the incident energy. It is shown that the latter
mechanism is responsible for the energy dependence of the fusion potential and
explains the fading out of the fluctuation-dissipation relation.

its smooth points of top dimension is a union of complex hyperplanes, and its
singular set is either of dimension $2n-2$ or dimension $2n-4$. If the singular

it is desirable to fuse and aggregate conditions which are similar to ease the
interpretation and extract the main characteristics of the data. This paper
presents a multidimensional fusion penalty framework to address this question
when the number of conditions is large. If the fusion penalty is encoded by an
$\ell_q$-norm, we prove for uniform weights that the path of solutions is a
tree which is suitable for interpretability. For the $\ell_1$ and
$\ell_\infty$-norms, the path is piecewise linear and we derive a homotopy
algorithm to recover exactly the whole tree structure. For weighted
$\ell_1$-fusion penalties, we demonstrate that distance-decreasing weights lead
to balanced tree structures. For a subclass of these weights that we call
""exponentially adaptive"", we derive an $\mathcal{O}(n\log(n))$ homotopy
algorithm and we prove an asymptotic oracle property. This guarantees that we
recover the underlying structure of the data efficiently both from a
statistical and a computational point of view. We provide a fast implementation
of the homotopy algorithm for the single feature case, as well as an efficient
embedded cross-validation procedure that takes advantage of the tree structure
of the path of solutions. Our proposal outperforms its competing procedures on
simulations both in terms of timings and prediction accuracy. As an example we
consider phenotypic data: given one or several traits, we reconstruct a
balanced tree structure and assess its agreement with the known taxonomy.

  steam generator","34",,,,"physics.comp-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We consider the inverse problem of estimating the shape profile of an unknown
deposit from a set of eddy current impedance measurements. The measurements are
acquired with an axial probe, which is modeled by a set of coils that generate
a magnetic field inside the tube. For the direct problem, we validate the
method that takes into account the tube support plates, highly conductive part,
by a surface impedance condition. For the inverse problem, finite element and
shape sensitivity analysis related to the eddy current problem are provided in
order to determine the explicit formula of the gradient of a least square
misfit functional. A geometrical-parametric shape inversion algorithm based on
cylindrical coordinates is designed to improve the robustness and the quality
of the reconstruction. Several numerical results are given in the experimental
part. Numerical experiments on synthetic deposits, nearby or far away from the
tube, with different shapes are considered in the axisymmetric configuration.

handling problems at container terminals are NP-hard problems. The docking time

simulation model that integrates all the activities of a container terminal.
The proposed approach is applied on a real case study data of container

reduced the ship turnaround time in port where 51% reduction in ship service
time (loading/unloading) in port is achieved.

capacity for authentic astronomical research at the high school level has
skyrocketed. This potential, however, has not realized the bright-eyed hopes
and dreams of the early pioneers who expected to revolutionise science
education through the use of telescopes and other astronomical instrumentation
in the classroom. In this paper, a general history and analysis of these
attempts is presented. We define what we classify as an Astronomy Research in
the Classroom (ARiC) project and note the major dimensions on which these
projects differ before describing the 22 major student research projects active
since the early 1990s. This is followed by a discussion of the major issues
identified that affected the success of these projects and provide suggestions
for similar attempts in the future.

of an inhomogeneous irrotational dust universe is presented. A fully
non-perturbative numerical computation of the time dependence of volume in this
framework leads to the following results. If the initial state of the universe
is Einstein-de Sitter with small Gaussian perturbations, then there is no
acceleration even though the inhomogeneities strongly affect the evolution. A
universe with a positive background curvature can exhibit acceleration, but not
in conjunction with reasonable values for the Hubble rate. Thus the correct
values for both quantities can be achieved only by introducing a positive
cosmological constant. Possible loopholes to this conclusion are discussed; in
particular, acceleration as an illusion created by peculiarities of light
propagation in an inhomogeneous universe is still possible. Independently of
the cosmological constant question, the present formalism should provide an
important tool for precision cosmology.

large applications in many contexts, e.g. for calculating angular momenta,
torques, rotations, volumes etc. Though this mathematical operator is widely
used, it is commonly expressed in a 3-D notation which gives rise to many
paradoxes and difficulties. In fact, instead of other vector operators like
scalar product, the cross product is defined just in 3-D space, it does not
respect reflection rules and invokes the concept of ""handedness"". In this paper
we are going to present an extension of cross product in an arbitrary number N
of spatial Dimensions, different from the one adopted in the Exterior Algebra
and explicitly designed for an easy calculus of moments.
