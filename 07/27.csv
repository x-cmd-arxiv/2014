such as intervals, (higher-order) fuzzy sets, rough sets, and shadowed sets,
which are all suitable to characterize the so-called information granules.
Modeling of the input data uncertainty is recognized as a crucial aspect in
information granulation. Moreover, the uncertainty is a well-studied concept in
many mathematical settings, such as those of probability theory, fuzzy set
theory, and possibility theory. This fact suggests that an appropriate
quantification of the uncertainty expressed by the information granule model
could be used to define an invariant property, to be exploited in practical
situations of information granulation. In this perspective, a procedure of
information granulation is effective if the uncertainty conveyed by the
synthesized information granule is in a monotonically increasing relation with
the uncertainty of the input data. In this paper, we present a data granulation
framework that elaborates over the principles of uncertainty introduced by
Klir. Being the uncertainty a mesoscopic descriptor of systems and data, it is
possible to apply such principles regardless of the input data type and the
specific mathematical setting adopted for the information granules. The
proposed framework is conceived (i) to offer a guideline for the synthesis of
information granules and (ii) to build a groundwork to compare and
quantitatively judge over different data granulation procedures. To provide a
suitable case study, we introduce a new data granulation technique based on the
minimum sum of distances, which is designed to generate type-2 fuzzy sets. We
analyze the procedure by performing different experiments on two distinct data
types: feature vectors and labeled graphs. Results show that the uncertainty of
the input data is suitably conveyed by the generated type-2 fuzzy set models.

Massive Open Online courses (MOOCs) have become the an important foci of

will bring the vision of equitable access to lifelong learning opportunities
within practical reach. MOOCs offer many valuable learning experiences to
students, from video lectures, readings, assignments and exams, to
opportunities to connect and collaborate with others through threaded
discussion forums and other Web 2.0 technologies. Nevertheless, despite all
this potential, MOOCs have so far failed to produce evidence that this
potential is being realized in the current instantiation of MOOCs. In this
work, we primarily explore video lecture interaction in Massive Open Online
Courses (MOOCs), which is central to student learning experience on these
educational platforms. As a research contribution, we operationalize video
lecture clickstreams of students into behavioral actions, and construct a
quantitative information processing index, that can aid instructors to better
understand MOOC hurdles and reason about unsatisfactory learning outcomes. Our
results illuminate the effectiveness of developing such a metric inspired by
cognitive psychology, towards answering critical questions regarding students'
engagement, their future click interactions and participation trajectories that
lead to in-video dropouts. We leverage recurring click behaviors to
differentiate distinct video watching profiles for students in MOOCs.
Additionally, we discuss about prediction of complete course dropouts,
incorporating diverse perspectives from statistics and machine learning, to
offer a more nuanced view into how the second generation of MOOCs be benefited,
if course instructors were to better comprehend factors that lead to student

that binary quantizers at the local sensors are optimal under certain

derive the performance limit for distributed location parameter estimation

threshold quantizer achieves this limit. We corroborate this result using
simulations. We then relax the assumption of conditionally independent

which the populations of either the adiabatic or the non-adiabatic levels are
(continuously and weakly) monitored. The weak measurement formalism, described
using a Gaussian Kraus operator, leads to a time evolution characterized by a
Markovian dephasing process, which, in the non-adiabatic measurement protocol
is similar to earlier studies of LZ dynamics in a dephasing environment.
Casting the problem in the language of measurement theory makes it possible for
us to compare diabatic and adiabatic measurement scenarios, to consider
engineered dephasing as a control device and to examine the manifestation of
the Zeno effect under the different measurement protocols. In particular, under
measurement of the non- adiabatic populations, the Zeno effect is manifested
not as a freezing of the measured system in its initial state, but rather as an
approach to equal asymptotic populations of the two diabatic states. This
behavior can be traced to the way by which the weak measurement formalism
behaves in the strong measurement limit, with a built-in relationship between
measurement time and strength.

the Pearson correlation and ones derived using average mean square-error rate
distortion arguments. Furthermore, their estimation is feasible using
techniques from nonparametric regression. As an illustration we provide
bootstrap confidence intervals for the lower bounds which, through use of a
composite estimator, substantially improve upon inference about mutual

that consensus networks are extremely sensitive to the existence of a single

likelihood ordering on sets of worlds in a natural way, and examine the
resulting logic. Lewis (1973) earlier considered such a notion of relative
likelihood in the context of studying counterfactuals, but he assumed a total

that are not present for total orders. There are subtleties involving the exact
approach to lifting the order on worlds to an order on sets of worlds. In
addition, the axiomatization of the logic of relative likelihood in the case of
partial orders gives insight into the connection between relative likelihood

a microwave signal digitally modulated by binary phase-shift keying. Moreover,
we apply this demodulation capability to the dispersive readout of a

It uses an integral control with adaptive gains, designed to provide fast

derivative of the plant-function with respect to the control parameter, and are
computed by infinitesimal perturbation analysis. Convergence of this technique
is shown to be robust with respect to modeling uncertainties, computing errors,

has received various applications in machine learning, wireless communications,
image restoration, signal reconstruction, etc. This paper aims to provide a
theoretical study on this problem. Firstly, we show that for any fixed $0<q<1$,
finding the global minimizer of the problem, even its unconstrained
counterpart, is strongly NP-hard. Secondly, we derive Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT)
optimality conditions for local minimizers of the problem. Thirdly, we propose
a smoothing sequential quadratic programming framework for solving this
problem. The framework requires a (approximate) solution of a convex quadratic
program at each iteration. Finally, we analyze the worst-case iteration
complexity of the framework for returning an $\epsilon$-KKT point; i.e., a
feasible point that satisfies a perturbed version of the derived KKT optimality
conditions. To the best of our knowledge, the proposed framework is the first
one with a worst-case iteration complexity guarantee for solving composite
$L_q$ minimization over a general polyhedron.

of light water reactors, by simulating specific reference irradiation
experiments.
  Following our previous study, the effect of carbon on radiation defect
evolution can be described in terms of formation of immobile complexes with
vacancies, that in turn act as traps for SIA clusters. This dynamics is
simulated using generic traps for SIA and vacancy clusters. The traps have a
binding energy that depends on the size and type of the clusters and is also
chosen on the basis of previously performed atomistic studies. The model had to
be adapted to account for the existence of two kinds of SIA clusters, <111> and
<100>, as observed in electron microscopy examinations of Fe alloys neutron
irradiated at the temperatures of technological interest.
  The model, which is fully based on physical considerations and only uses a
few parameters for calibration, is found to be capable of reproducing the
experimental trends, thereby providing insight into the physical mechanisms of
importance to determine the type of nanostructural evolution undergone by the
material during irradiation.

In our recent paper [R. Hanai, et. al., Phys. Rev. A 88, 053621 (2013)], we
showed that an extended $T$-matrix approximation (ETMA) can overcome the
serious problem known in the ordinary (non-self-consistent) $T$-matrix
approximation that it unphysically gives double-valued superfluid phase
transition temperature $T_{\rm c}$ in the presence of mass imbalance. However,
at the same time, the ETMA was also found to give the vanishing $T_{\rm c}$ in
the weak-coupling and highly mass-imbalanced case. In this paper, we inspect
the correctness of this ETMA result, using the self-consistent $T$-matrix
approximation (SCTMA). We show that the vanishing $T_{\rm c}$ is an artifact of
the ETMA, coming from an internal inconsistency of this theory. The superfluid
phase transition actually always occurs, irrespective of the ratio of mass
imbalance. We also apply the SCTMA to the pseudogap problem in a
mass-imbalanced Fermi gas. We show that pairing fluctuations induce different
pseudogap phenomena between the the light component and heavy component. We
also point out that a $^6$Li-$^{40}$K mixture is a useful system for the
realization of a hetero pairing state, as well as for the study of
component-dependent pseudogap phenomena.

frequency does not exist - it is a typical misinterpretation that discrete
power spectra of non-stationary signals can suggest; (2) appropriate continuous
periodograms clarify the issue and also show a signature of the 11-year solar
cycle (amplitude <0.1 K), which since 1850 has an average period of about 10.4
year, and of many other natural oscillations; (3) the solar signature in the
surface temperature record can be recognized only using specific techniques of
analysis that take into account non-linearity and filtering of the multiple
climate change contributions; (4) the post 1880-year temperature warming trend
cannot be compared or studied against the sunspot record and its 11-year cycle,
but requires solar proxy models showing short and long scale oscillations plus
the contribution of anthropogenic forcings, as done in the literature. Multiple
evidences suggest that global temperatures and sunspot numbers are quite
related to each other at multiple time scales through complex and non-linear
processes. Finally, I show that the prediction of a semi-empirical model for
the global temperature based on astronomical oscillations and anthropogenic
forcing proposed by Scafetta since 2009 has up to date been successful.

equivalently, on the black hole temperature perceived by observers defining the

industry. Therefore, research on new supramolecular structures shows promise.
Supramolecular structures of the whey proteins {\alpha}-lactalbumin and
glycomacropeptide were produced under varying heat treatments (25 to 75
{\deg}C) and acidic conditions (pH 3.5 to 6.5). Isothermal titration
calorimetry experiments showed protein interactions and demonstrated that this
is an enthalpically driven process. Supramolecular protein structures in
aqueous solutions were characterized by circular dichroism and intrinsic
fluorescence spectroscopy. Additional photon correlation spectroscopy
experiments showed that the size distribution of the structures ranged from 4
to 3545 nm among the different conditions. At higher temperatures, lower pH
increased particle size. The foamability of the supramolecular protein
structures was evaluated. Analysis of variance and analysis of regression for
foaming properties indicated that the two-factor interactions between pH and
temperature exhibited a significant effect on the volume and stability of the
foam.

  Improvement: A new Neighbour Selection Scheme for Kademlia-type Systems' at
  IEEE P2P 2014",,,,"cs.NI cs.DC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Discovery of nodes and content in large-scale distributed systems is
generally based on Kademlia, today. Understanding Kademlia-type systems to
improve their performance is essential for maintaining a high service quality
for an increased number of participants, particularly when those systems are
adopted by latency-sensitive applications.
  This paper contributes to the understanding of Kademlia by studying the
impact of \emph{diversifying} neighbours' identifiers within each routing table
bucket on the lookup performance. We propose a new, yet backward-compatible,
neighbour selection scheme that attempts to maximize the aforementioned
diversity. The scheme does not cause additional overhead except negligible
computations for comparing the diversity of identifiers. We present a
theoretical model for the actual impact of the new scheme on the lookup's hop
count and validate it against simulations of three exemplary Kademlia-type
systems. We also measure the performance gain enabled by a partial deployment
for the scheme in the real KAD system. The results confirm the superiority of
the systems that incorporate our scheme.
