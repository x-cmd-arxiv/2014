  dosimetry","Technical note describing the skewness/kurtosis method of detecting
  range mixing. 39 pages, 2 tables, 32 figures",,,,"physics.med-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Technical Note describing studies, in 2011, of time resolved diode dosimetry
in an anthropomorphic phantom at the Francis H. Burr Proton Therapy Center,
Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA. This technique measures the water
equivalent path length (WEPL) to a diode dosimeter with sub-millimeter
precision, using very little dose. It may allow one to use the proton stopping
point (otherwise too uncertain) to cut between tissue to be treated and tissue
to be spared, in cases (such as the prostate) where a diode can be placed in a
cavity (the rectum) distal to the target.
  A potential problem is range mixing, where (because of scattering) protons
may arrive at a diode with different energy-loss histories. The WEPL reported
by such a diode is meaningless and must be ignored. We therefore use an array
of diodes, of which some are likely to be at more favorable locations. In
addition to the overall analysis of time resolved data, this Note describes in
detail how range mixed diodes can be identified by looking at the skewness and
kurtosis of the time dependent signal.

We found that NaMnF3 undergoes a reconstructive phase transition at 8 GPa from
the Pnma distorted perovskite structure toward the Cmcm post-perovskite
structure. This is confirmed by a sudden change of the Mn-F-Mn bondings where
the crystal goes from corner shared octahedra in the Pnma phase to edge shared
octahedra in the Cmcm phase. The magnetic ordering also changes from a G-type
antiferromagnetic ordering in the Pnma phase to a C-type antiferromagnetic
ordering in the Cmcm phase. Interestingly, we found that the high-spin
d-orbital filling is kept at the phase transition which has never been observed
in the known magnetic post-perovskite structures. We also found a highly
non-collinear magnetic ordering in the Cmcm post-perovskite phase that drives a
large ferromagnetic canting of the spins. We discuss the validity of these
results with respect to the U and J parameter of the GGA+U exchange correlation
functional used in our study and conclude that large spin canting is a
promising property of the post-perovskite fluoride compounds.

  Series","29 pages, 27 figures",,,,"stat.ME math.ST stat.TH","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper addresses the issue of detecting change-points in multivariate
time series. The proposed approach differs from existing counterparts by making
only weak assumptions on both the change-points structure across series, and
the statistical signal distributions. Specifically change-points are not
assumed to occur at simultaneous time instants across series, and no specific
distribution is assumed on the individual signals. It relies on the combination
of a local robust statistical test acting on individual time segments, with a
global Bayesian framework able to optimize configurations from multiple local
statistics (from segments of a unique time series or multiple time series).
Using an extensive experimental set-up, our algorithm is shown to perform well
on Gaussian data, with the same results in term of recall and precision as
classical approaches, such as the fused lasso and the Bernoulli Gaussian model.
Furthermore, it outperforms the reference models in the case of non normal data
with outliers. The control of the False Discovery Rate by an acceptance level
is confirmed. In the case of multivariate data, the probabilities that
simultaneous change-points are shared by some specific time series are learned.
We finally illustrate our algorithm with real datasets from energy monitoring
and genomic. Segmentations are compared to state-of-the-art approaches based on
fused lasso and group fused lasso.

found applications in numerous disciplines. In this letter, we use such methods
to solve a long-standing problem in statistical genetics. The problem, posed by
Haldane and Waddington [J.B.S. Haldane and C.H. Waddington, Genetics 16,
357-374 (1931)], concerns so-called recombinant inbred lines (RILs) produced by
repeated inbreeding. Haldane and Waddington derived the probabilities of RILs
when considering 2 and 3 genes but the case of 4 or more genes has remained
elusive. Our solution uses two probabilistic frameworks relatively unknown
outside of physics: Glauber's formula and self-consistent equations of the
Schwinger-Dyson type. Surprisingly, this combination of statistical formalisms
unveils the exact probabilities of RILs for any number of genes. Extensions of
the framework may have applications in population genetics and beyond.

record: the visual sunspot counts that retrace the last 4 centuries, since the
invention of the astronomical telescope. Currently, this activity index is
available in two main forms: the International Sunspot Number initiated by R.
Wolf in 1849 and the Group Number constructed more recently by Hoyt and
Schatten (1998a,b). Unfortunately, those two series do not match by various
aspects, inducing confusions and contradictions when used in crucial
contemporary studies of the solar dynamo or of the solar forcing on the Earth
climate. Recently, new efforts have been undertaken to diagnose and correct
flaws and biases affecting both sunspot series, in the framework of a series of
dedicated Sunspot Number Workshops. Here, we present a global overview of our
current understanding of the sunspot number calibration. While the early part
of the sunspot record before 1800 is still characterized by large uncertainties
due to poorly observed periods, the more recent sunspot numbers are mainly
affected by three main inhomogeneities: in 1880-1915 for the Group Number and
in 1947 and 1980-2014 for the Sunspot Number. The newly corrected series
clearly indicates a progressive decline of solar activity before the onset of
the Maunder Minimum, while the slowly rising trend of the activity after the
Maunder Minimum is strongly reduced, suggesting that by the mid 18th century,
solar activity had already returned to the level of those observed in recent
solar cycles in the 20th century. We finally conclude with future prospects
opened by this epochal revision of the Sunspot Number, the first one since Wolf
himself, and its reconciliation with the Group Number, a long-awaited
modernization that will feed solar cycle research into the 21st century.

using directional complex tight wavelet frames. Under the assumption that frame
coefficients of images are sparse, several iterative thresholding algorithms
for the image inpainting problem have been proposed in the literature. The
outputs of such iterative algorithms are closely linked to solutions of several
convex minimization models using the balanced approach which simultaneously
combines the $l_1$-regularization for sparsity of frame coefficients and the
$l_2$-regularization for smoothness of the solution. Due to the redundancy of a
tight frame, elements of a tight frame could be highly correlated and
therefore, their corresponding frame coefficients of an image are expected to
close to each other. This is called the grouping effect in statistics. In this
paper, we establish the grouping effect property for frame-based convex
minimization models using the balanced approach. This result on grouping effect
partially explains the effectiveness of models using the balanced approach for
several image restoration problems. Inspired by recent development on
directional tensor product complex tight framelets (TP-CTFs) and their
impressive performance for the image denoising problem, in this paper we
propose an iterative thresholding algorithm using a single tight frame derived
from TP-CTFs for the image inpainting problem. Experimental results show that
our proposed algorithm can handle well both cartoons and textures
simultaneously and performs comparably and often better than several well-known
frame-based iterative thresholding algorithms for the image inpainting problem
without noise. For the image inpainting problem with additive zero-mean i.i.d.
Gaussian noise, our proposed algorithm using TP-CTFs performs superior than
other known state-of-the-art frame-based image inpainting algorithms.

the molecular structures vary from 3e5 to 1e7 Mo3 and the CO(2-1) linewidths
vary from 15 to 65 km/s. Given the large CO(2-1) linewidths, the observed
structures are likely giant molecular associations (GMAs) and not individual
molecular clouds (GMCs). Only a few of the GMAs are spatially resolved with the
cycle 0 ALMA beam and the average density of these GMAs yields a GMC volume
filling factor of about 15%. The observed masses of the resolved GMAs are
insufficient for them to be gravitationally bound, however, the most massive
GMA does contain a less massive component with a linewidth of 5.5 km/s (typical
of an individual virialized GMC). We also show that the GMAs cannot be pressure
confined by the hot gas. Given the observed CO(2-1) linewidths of the GMAs
(i.e., the velocity dispersion of the embedded GMCs) they will likely disperse
on a timescale of about 12 Myr, which is less than the central cooling time of
the hot gas, so the embedded GMCs within a GMA must condense out of the hot gas
at the same time and arise from local concentrations of thermally unstable
parcels of hot gas. There are no indications of any disk-like molecular
structures and all indications suggest that the molecular gas follows ballistic
trajectories after condensing out of the thermally unstable hot gas. The 230
GHz luminosity of the central continuum source is 500 times greater than its
low frequency radio luminosity and probably reflects a recent accretion event
by the central supermassive black hole. The spectrum of the central continuum
source also exhibits an absorption feature.

  to spectral dimensions","36 pages",,,,"math.PR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The Liouville Brownian motion (LBM), recently introduced by Garban, Rhodes
and Vargas and in a weaker form also by Berestycki, is a diffusion process
evolving in a planar random geometry induced by the Liouville measure
$M_\gamma$, formally written as $M_\gamma(dz)=e^{\gamma X(z)-{\gamma^2}
\mathbb{E}[X(z)^2]/2}\, dz$, $\gamma\in(0,2)$, for a (massive) Gaussian free
field $X$. It is an $M_\gamma$-symmetric diffusion defined as the time change
of the two-dimensional Brownian motion by the positive continuous additive
functional with Revuz measure $M_\gamma$.
  In this paper we provide a detailed analysis of the heat kernel $p_t(x,y)$ of
the LBM. Specifically, we prove its joint continuity, a locally uniform
sub-Gaussian upper bound of the form $p_t(x,y)\leq C_{1} t^{-1} \log(t^{-1})
  \exp\bigl(-C_{2}((|x-y|^{\beta}\wedge 1)/t)^{\frac{1}{\beta -1}}\bigr)$ for
$t\in(0,\frac{1}{2}]$ for each $\beta>\frac{1}{2}(\gamma+2)^2$, and an
on-diagonal lower bound of the form $p_{t}(x,x)\geq
C_{3}t^{-1}\bigl(\log(t^{-1})\bigr)^{-\eta}$ for $t\in(0,t_{\eta}(x)]$, with
$t_{\eta}(x)\in(0,\frac{1}{2}]$ heavily dependent on $x$, for each $\eta>18$
for $M_{\gamma}$-almost every $x$. As applications, we deduce that the
pointwise spectral dimension equals $2$ $M_\gamma$-a.e.\ and that the global
spectral dimension is also $2$.

differences between these modules. Using a semi-intact preparation that left
one swimmeret attached to an otherwise isolated crayfish central nervous system
of the crayfish, we investigated how the rhythmic activity of this system
responded to imposed movements. We recorded extracellularly from the Ps and Rs
nerves that innervated the attached limb and from coordinating axons that
encode efference copies of the periodic bursts in Ps and Rs axons.
Simultaneously we recorded from homologous nerves in more anterior and

promptly weakened Ps bursts, strengthened Rs bursts, and caused corresponding
changes in the strength and timing of efference copies in the coordinating
axons. These changes in strength and timing of these efference copies then
caused changes in the phase and duration, but not the strength, of Ps bursts in
modules controlling neighboring swimmerets. These changes were promptly
reversed when the limb was released. Each swimmeret is innervated by two
nonspiking stretch receptors, Nssrs, that depolarize when the limb is
retracted. Voltage-clamp of an Nssr changed the durations and strengths of
bursts in Ps and Rs axons innervating the same limb, and caused corresponding

Sun. A magnetic field was used to infer the location and orientation of the
magnetic field lines along which the waves are expected to travel. The waves
were measured using spectral lines to infer the wave amplitude. The waves cause
a non-thermal broadening of the spectral lines, which can be expressed as a
non-thermal velocity v_nt. By combining the spectroscopic measurements with
this magnetic field model we were able to trace the variation of v_nt along the
magnetic field. At the footpoints of the quiet Sun loops we find that waves
inject an energy flux in the range of 1.2-5.2 x 10^5 erg cm^-2 s^-1. At the
minimum of this range, this amounts to more than 80% of the energy needed to
heat the quiet Sun. We also find that these waves are dissipated over a region
centered on the top of the loops. The position along the loop where the damping
begins is strongly correlated with the length of the loop, implying that the
damping mechanism depends on the global loop properties rather than on local
collisional dissipation.

combinatorial optimization problems. In the field of approximation algorithms,
this is well illustrated by the uncapacitated facility location problem. A
variety of algorithmic methodologies, such as LP-rounding and primal-dual
method, have been applied to and evolved from algorithms for this problem.
Unfortunately, this collection of powerful algorithmic techniques had not yet
been applicable to the more general capacitated facility location problem. In
fact, all of the known algorithms with good performance guarantees were based
on a single technique, local search, and no linear programming relaxation was
known to efficiently approximate the problem.
  In this paper, we present a linear programming relaxation with constant
integrality gap for capacitated facility location. We demonstrate that the
fundamental theories of multi-commodity flows and matchings provide key
insights that lead to the strong relaxation. Our algorithmic proof of
integrality gap is obtained by finally accessing the rich toolbox of LP-based
methodologies: we present a constant factor approximation algorithm based on
LP-rounding.

the symmetries of isospinning Skyrme solitons can differ significantly from the
ones of the static configurations. In particular, isospinning Skyrmion

ignored in previous work on modeling nuclei by quantized Skyrmion solutions.

spectral absorption features and on temporal variations that could be used to
obtain altitude-dependent spectra for planets orbiting stars of different
stellar types. We validate our model against altitude-dependent transmission
spectra of the Earth from ATMOS and against lunar eclipse spectra from Palle et
al. (2009). We perform detectability studies to show the potential effects of
refraction on hypothetical observations of Earth analogs with the James Webb
Space Telescope (JWST) Near-Infrared Spectrograph (NIRSPEC). Due to refraction,
there will be a maximum tangent pressure level that can be probed during
transit for each given planet-star system. We show that because of refraction,
for an Earth-analog planet orbiting in the habitable zone of a Sun-like star
only the top 0.3 bars of the atmosphere can be probed, leading to a decrease in
the signal to noise ratio (SNR) of absorption features by 60%, while for an
Earth-analog planet orbiting in the habitable zone of an M5V star it is
possible to probe almost the entire atmosphere with minimal decreases in SNR.
We also show that refraction can result in temporal variations in the transit
transmission spectrum which may provide a way to obtain altitude-dependent
spectra of exoplanet atmospheres. Additionally, the variations prior to ingress
and subsequent to egress provide a way to probe pressures greater than the
maximum tangent pressure that can be probed during transit. Therefore, probing
the maximum range of atmospheric altitudes, and in particular the near-surface
environment of an Earth-analog exoplanet, will require looking at
out-of-transit refracted light in addition to the in-transit spectrum.

transient sky, we investigate the importance of relativistic effects in
disruptions of stars by non-spinning black holes (BHs). This paper focuses on
calculating the ballistic rate of return of debris to the black hole as this
rate is commonly assumed to be proportional to the light curve of the event. We
simulate the disruption of a low mass main sequence star by BHs of varying
masses ($10^5,10^6,10^7 M_\odot$) and of a white dwarf by a $10^5 M_\odot$ BH.
Based on the orbital energy as well as angular momentum of the debris, we infer
the orbital distribution and estimate the return rate of the debris following
the disruption. We find two signatures of relativistic disruptions: a gradual
rise as well as a delayed peak in the return rate curves relative to their
Newtonian analogs. Assuming that the return rates are proportional to the light
curves, we find that relativistic effects are in principle measurable given the
cadence and sensitivity of the current transient sky surveys. Accordingly,
using a simple model of a relativistic encounter with a Newtonian parametric
fit of the peak leads to an overestimate in the BH mass by a factor of $\sim
{\rm few}\times0.1$ and $\sim {\rm few}$ in the case of the main sequence star
and white dwarf tidal disruptions, respectively.

negligible contribution to the anisotropy, while high-synchrotron-peaked BL

galaxies around isolated Milky Way-like hosts in the local Universe. We find
that the efficiency of satellite quenching around isolated galaxies is low and
roughly constant over two orders of magnitude in satellite stellar mass
($M_{*}$ = $10^{8.5}-10^{10.5} \, M_{\odot}$), with only $\sim~20\%$ of systems
quenched as a result of environmental processes. While largely independent of
satellite stellar mass, satellite quenching does exhibit clear dependence on
the properties of the host. We show that satellites of passive hosts are
substantially more likely to be quenched than those of star-forming hosts, and
we present evidence that more massive halos quench their satellites more
efficiently. These results extend trends seen previously in more massive host
halos and for higher satellite masses. Taken together, it appears that galaxies
with stellar masses larger than about $10^{8}~M_{\odot}$ are uniformly
resistant to environmental quenching, with the relative harshness of the host
environment likely serving as the primary driver of satellite quenching. At
lower stellar masses ($< 10^{8}~M_{\odot}$), however, observations of the Local
Group suggest that the vast majority of satellite galaxies are quenched,
potentially pointing towards a characteristic satellite mass scale below which
quenching efficiency increases dramatically.

bolometric fluxes under the assumption that a star is not rotating causes an
underestimate of the inferred fluxes and, thus, radii. The correction depends
on the stellar spin, radius, and observer's inclination. For a 10 km neutron
star spinning at 600 Hz, the rotational correction to the flux is ~1-4%, while
for a 15 km neutron star with the same spin period, the correction ranges from
2% for pole-on sources to 12% for edge-on sources. We calculate the

and small-scale changes in the magnetic field direction in Cloud 3. In the
northern and western $\zeta$ Oph facing regions of the cloud, the magnetic
field appears to be pushed up against the face of the cloud. This may indicate
that the UV flux from $\zeta$ Oph has compressed the magnetic field on the
western edge of L204. The plane-of-sky magnetic field strength is estimated to
be $\sim 11 - 26$ $\mu$G using the Chandrasekhar-Fermi method. The polarimetry

closely upon the fact that neutral current neutrino nucleon interactions are

population of DM particle $\chi$, created via the decay of a significantly more
massive and long-lived non-thermal relic $\phi$, which forms the bulk of DM. If
$\chi$ interacts with nucleons, its cross-section, like the neutrino-nucleus
coherent cross-section, can rise sharply with energy leading to deep inelastic
scattering, similar to neutral current neutrino-nucleon interactions at high
energies. Thus, its direct detection may be possible via cascades in very large
neutrino detectors. As a specific example, we apply this notion to the recently
reported three ultra-high energy PeV cascade events clustered around $1-2$ PeV

phenomena arising from chiral gauge and gravitational anomalies that lead to
generation of electric currents in presence of magnetic field or vorticity. The
magnitude of these effects is determined by the anomalous conductivities. These
conductivities can be calculated by the linear response theory, and in the
strong coupling limit this calculation can be carried out by the holographic
techniques. Earlier calculations in case of conformal field theories indicate
non-renormalization of these conductivities where the holographic calculation
agrees with the free field limit. We extend this holographic study to
non-conformal theories exhibiting mass-gap and confinement-deconfinement type
transitions in a holographic model based on the analytic black hole solution of
Gao and Zhang. We show that radiative corrections are also absent in these
non-conformal theories confirming indirect arguments of Jensen et al in a
direct and non-trivial fashion. There are various indications in field theory
that such radiative corrections should arise when contribution of dynamical
gluon fields to the chiral anomaly is present. Motivated by this, we seek for
such corrections in the holographic picture and argue that such corrections
indeed arise through mixing of the background and its fluctuations with the
axion and the one-form fields that couple to the flavor and probe gauge branes
through the Wess-Zumino terms. These corrections are non-vanishing when the

As a step in this direction we enumerate rigid clusters of identical hard
spheres for $n\leq 14$, and clusters with the maximum number of contacts for
$n\leq 19$. A rigid cluster is one that cannot be continuously deformed while
maintaining all contacts. This is a nonlinear notion that arises naturally
because such clusters are the metastable states when the spheres interact with
a short-range potential, as is the case in many nano- or micro-scale systems.
We expect these lists are nearly complete, except for a small number of highly
singular clusters (linearly floppy but nonlinearly rigid.) The data contains
some major geometrical surprises, such as the prevalence of hypostatic
clusters: those with less than the $3n-6$ contacts generically necessary for
rigidity. We discuss these and several other unusual clusters, whose geometries
may shed insight into physical mechanisms, pose mathematical and computational

in asynchronous systems with information about faults. This information can
then be used to solve problems otherwise unsolvable in asynchronous systems. A
natural question is on the ""minimum amount of information"" a failure detector
has to provide for a given problem. This question is classically addressed
using a relation that states that a failure detector D is stronger (that is,
provides ""more, or better, information"") than a failure detector D' if D can be
used to implement D'. It has recently been shown that this classic
implementability relation has some drawbacks. To overcome this, different
relations have been defined, one of which states that a failure detector D is
stronger than D' if D can solve all the time-free problems solvable by D'. In
this paper we compare the implementability-based hierarchy of failure detectors
to the hierarchy based on solvability. This is done by introducing a new proof
technique for establishing the solvability relation. We apply this technique to
known failure detectors from the literature and demonstrate significant
differences between the hierarchies.

after abruptly switching on the supercritical current $I>I_c$. In contrast to
previous theoretical works we take into account spatial gradients and use both
the local temperature approach and the kinetic equation for the distribution
function of quasiparticles. In both models the finite delay time $t_d$ in the
voltage response is connected with temporary cooling of quasiparticles due to
the suppression of the superconducitng order parameter by current. We find that
$t_d$ has different values and different temperature dependencies in the
considered models. In turns out that the presence of even small inhomogeneities
in the bridge or of bulk leads/contacts at the ends of the {\it homogenous}
bridge favors a local suppression of the superconducting order parameter
$|\Delta|$ during the dynamic response. It results in a decrease of the delay
time, in comparison with the spatially uniform model, due to the diffusion of
nonequilibrium quasiparticles from the region with locally suppressed
$|\Delta|$. In case the current distribution is spatially nonuniform across the
bridge the delay time is mainly connected with the time needed for the
nucleation of the first vortex at the position where the current density is
maximal (at $I\sim I_c$ and for not very wide films). We also find that a short
alternating current pulse (sinusoid like) with zero time-average may result in
a nonzero time-averaged voltage response where its sign depends on the phase of
the ac current.

possible mechanism to truncate the disk--a two-stage, inward-then-outward

simulations of giant planet formation. In addition to truncating the disk and
producing a more realistic Earth/Mars mass ratio, the migration of the giant
planets also populates the asteroid belt with two distinct populations of
bodies--the inner belt is filled by bodies originating inside of 3 AU, and the
outer belt is filled with bodies originating from between and beyond the giant
planets (which are hereafter referred to as `primitive' bodies).
  We find here that the planets will accrete on order 1-2% of their total mass
from primitive planetesimals scattered onto planet-crossing orbits during the
formation of the planets. For an assumed value of 10% for the water mass
fraction of the primitive planetesimals, this model delivers a total amount of
water comparable to that estimated to be on the Earth today. While the radial
distribution of the planetary masses and the dynamical excitation of their
orbits are a good match to the observed system, we find that the last giant
impact is typically earlier than 20 Myr, and a substantial amount of mass is
accreted after that event. However, 5 of the 27 planets larger than half an
Earth mass formed in all simulations do experience large late impacts and
subsequent accretion consistent with the dating of the Moon-forming impact and

did not take the possible contributions to the envelope ejection from
additional sources of energy (mostly recombination energy) into account. Here
we update existing binary population models of WD+MS PCEBs by assuming that a
fraction of the recombination energy available within the envelope contributes
to ejecting the envelope. We performed Monte Carlo simulations of 10^7 MS+MS
binaries for 9 different models using standard assumptions for the initial
primary mass function, binary separations, and initial-mass-ratio distribution
and evolved these systems using the publicly available BSE code. Including a
fraction of recombination energy leads to a clear prediction of a large number
of long orbital period (>~10 days) systems mostly containing high-mass WDs. The
fraction of systems with He-core WD primaries increases with the CE efficiency
and the existence of very low-mass He WDs is only predicted for high values of
the CE efficiency (>~0.5). All models predict on average longer orbital periods
for PCEBs containing C/O-core WDs than for PCEBs containing He WDs. This effect
increases with increasing values of both efficiencies. Longer periods after the
CE phase are also predicted for systems containing more massive secondary
stars. The initial-mass-ratio distribution affects the distribution of orbital
periods, especially the distribution of secondary star masses. Our simulations,
in combination with a large and homogeneous observational sample, can provide
constraints on the values of the CE efficiencies, as well as on the

regions for oscillation model parameters are likely the only rigorous method
for these comparisons, the $L/E$ distributions are shown to give qualitative

eccentric pre-main-sequence binary system DQ Tau. In a multi-epoch survey
consisting of randomly acquired low to moderate resolution near-infrared
spectra obtained over a period of almost ten years, we detect a significant and
simultaneous brightening of four standard accretion indicators (CaII infrared
triplet, the Paschen and Brackett series HI lines, and HeI 1.083 um), on
back-to-back nights (phase = 0.372, 0.433) with the flare increasing in
strength as the system approached apastron (phase = 0.5). The mass accretion
rate measured for the anomalous flare is nearly an order of magnitude stronger
than the average quiescent rate. While previous observations established that
frequent, periodic accretion flares phased with periastron passages occur in
this system, these data provide evidence that orbitally-modulated accretion
flares occur near apastron, when the stars make their closest approach to the
circumbinary disk. The timing of the flare suggests that this outburst is due
to interactions of the stellar cores (or the highly truncated circumstellar
disks) with material in non-axisymmetric structures located at the inner edge
of the circumbinary disk. We also explore the optical/infrared spectral type
mismatch previously observed for T Tauri stars and successfully model the shape
of the spectra from 0.8 to 1.0 um and the strengths of the TiO and FeH bands as
manifestations of large cool spots on the surfaces of the stellar companions in
DQ Tau. These findings illustrate that a complete model of near-infrared
spectra of many T Tauri stars must include parameters for spot filling factors

Performing the matching of transverse momentum distributions onto the standard

exponentiated part is spin-independent and resummable. We argue that the
inclusion of higher order perturbative pieces is necessary when data from lower
energy scales are analyzed. We consider non-perturbative corrections both to
the intrinsic nucleon structure and to the evolution kernel and find that the
non-perturbative part of the TMDs could be parametrized in terms of a minimal
set of parameters (namely 2-3). When all corrections are included the global

measures of superposition size: one based on the optimal quantum binary
distinguishability of the branches of the superposition and another based on
the ratio of the maximal quantum Fisher information of the superposition to
that of its branches, i.e., the relative metrological usefulness of the
superposition. A general formula for the effective sizes of these states
according to the branch distinguishability measure is obtained and applied to
superposition states of $N$ quantum harmonic oscillators composed of Gaussian

time-evolution path leads naturally to a notion of distinguishability time that
generalizes the well known orthogonalization times of Mandelstam and Tamm and
Margolus and Levitin. We further show that the distinguishability time provides
a compact operational expression for the superposition size measure based on
the relative quantum Fisher information. By restricting the maximization
procedure in the definition of this measure to an appropriate algebra of
observables, we show that the superposition size of, e.g., N00N states and
hierarchical cat states, can scale linearly with the number of elementary
particles comprising the superposition state, implying precision scaling
inversely with the total number of photons when these states are employed as

a higher dimensional homogeneous gravitational field is considered. We study
two cases, when a particle has usual electric charge and a case when it has a
scalar charge, which is a source of a scalar massless minimally coupled field.
We assume that a particle is at rest in the gravitational field, so that its
motion is not geodesic and it has an acceleration a directed from the horizon.
The self-energy of a point charge is divergent and the strength of the
divergence grows with the number of dimensions. In order to obtain a finite
contribution to the self- energy we use a covariant regularization method which
is a modification of the proper time cut-off and other covariant
regularizations. We analyze a relation between the self-energy and self-force
and obtain explicit expressions for the self-forces for the electric and scalar
charge in the spacetimes with the number of dimensions up to eight. General
expressions for the case of higher dimensions are also obtained. We discuss
special logarithmic factors ln(a), which are present both in the self-energy
and self-force in odd dimensions. Finally, we compare the obtained results with
the earlier known results both for the homogeneous gravitational field and for
particles near black holes.

we introduce a methodology that obtains the long time statistics of such
metrics in a network. After describing the general approach, we present a
specific example of the uplink channel of a mobile user in the vicinity of a
massive MIMO base-station antenna array. To guarantee a fixed SINR and rate,
the user inverts the path-loss channel power, while moving around in the cell.
To calculate the long time distribution of the consumed energy of the user, we
assume his movement follows a Brownian motion, and then map the problem to the
solution of the minimum eigenvalue of a partial differential equation, which
can be solved either analytically, or numerically very fast. We also treat the
throughput of a single user. We then discuss the results and how they can be
generalized if the mobility is assumed to be a Levy random walk. We also
provide a roadmap to use this technique when one considers multiple users and

what occurs in the Kitaev model. This separation enables the systematic study
of the entanglement of this 3D interacting bosonic model by using the tools of

however, in the entanglement spectrum of the Majorana fermions that distinguish

simulations. One approach to mitigate the computational cost is to build a
surrogate model, i.e., an approximate mapping from model parameters (input) to
observable quantities (output), so the forward simulations can be done quickly.
Alternatively, if the surrogate is constructed to approximate the inverse
mapping from model outputs to parameters, the parameter estimates can be
obtained directly by treating measurements as inputs to this inverse surrogate.
Moreover, the uncertainties of parameters can be quantified by propagating the
measurement uncertainties in a straightforward Monte Carlo manner. Based on
this idea, we proposed a novel surrogate-based approach for parameter
estimation and uncertainty assessment, i.e., the Inverse Gaussian Process Monte
Carlo (IGPMC) algorithm. The Gaussian Process (GP) regression is used to
directly approximate the inverse function of the model output-input
relationship. For ill-posed problems, i.e., when there exist non-unique sets of
input parameters that all produce an identical system output, multiple inverse
GP systems are constructed and multiple parameter estimates can be obtained
accordingly. The accuracy and efficiency of this IGPMC algorithm were
demonstrated through four numerical case studies. Results obtained from the
Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) are used as references to assess our new
proposed method. It was shown that, the IGPMC algorithm can generally obtain
reliable parameter estimates with an affordable computational cost.

multiple stars. In multiple-star systems, planet formation is under the
dynamical influence of stellar companions, and the planet occurrence rate is
expected to be different from that for single stars. There have been numerous
studies on the planet occurrence rate of single star systems. However, to fully
understand planet formation, the planet occurrence rate in multiple-star
systems needs to be addressed. In this work, we {{infer}} the planet occurrence
rate in multiple-star systems by measuring the stellar multiplicity rate for
planet host stars. For a sub-sample of 56 $Kepler$ planet host stars, we use
adaptive optics (AO) imaging and the radial velocity (RV) technique to search
for stellar companions. The combination of these two techniques results in high
search completeness for stellar companions. We detect 59 visual stellar
companions to 25 planet host stars with AO data. {{Three stellar companions are
within 2$^{\prime\prime}$, and 27 within 6$^{\prime\prime}$. We also detect 2
possible stellar companions (KOI 5 and KOI 69) showing long-term RV
acceleration.}} After correcting for a bias against planet detection in
multiple-star systems due to flux contamination, we find that planet formation
is suppressed in multiple-star systems with separations smaller than 1500 AU.
Specifically, we find that compared to single star systems, planets in
multiple-star systems occur $4.5\pm3.2$, $2.6\pm1.0$, and $1.7\pm0.5$ times
less frequently when a stellar companion is present at a distance of 10, 100,
and 1000 AU, respectively. This conclusion applies only to circumstellar
planets; the planet occurrence rate for circumbinary planets requires further
investigation.

falls off exponentially. Often what lies beyond such a stellar disc is the
neutral hydrogen gas whose distribution also follows a nearly exponential
profile at least for a number of nearby disc galaxies. Both the stars and gas
are commonly known to host lopsided asymmetry especially in the outer parts of
a galaxy. The role of such asymmetry in the dynamical evolution of a galaxy has
not been explored so far.
  Following Lindblad's original idea of kinematic density waves, we show that
the outer part of an exponential disc is ideally suitable for hosting lopsided
asymmetry. Further, we compute the transport of angular momentum in the
combined stars and gas disc embedded in a dark matter halo. We show that in a
pure star and gas disc, there is a transition point where the free precession
frequency of a lopsided mode, $\Omega -\kappa $, changes from retrograde to
prograde and this in turn reverses the direction of angular momentum flow in
the disc leading to an unphysical behaviour. We show that this problem is
overcome in the presence of a dark matter halo, which sets the angular momentum
flow outwards as required for disc evolution, provided the lopsidedness is
leading in nature. This, plus the well-known angular momentum transport in the
inner parts due to spiral arms, can facilitate an inflow of gas from outside
perhaps through the cosmic filaments.

forced-dissipative barotropic turbulence on a beta-plane. The dynamics
underlying the formation of both zonal and non-zonal coherent structures is
investigated in this work within the statistical framework of Stochastic
Structural Stability Theory (S3T). Previous S3T studies have shown that the
homogeneous turbulent state undergoes a bifurcation at a critical parameter and
becomes inhomogeneous with the emergence of zonal and/or large-scale non-zonal
flows and that these statistical predictions of S3T are reflected in direct
numerical simulations. In this paper, we study the dynamics underlying the S3T
statistical instability of the homogeneous state as a function of parameters.
It is shown that for weak planetary vorticity gradient, $\beta$, both zonal
jets and non-zonal large-scale structures form from upgradient momentum fluxes
due to shearing of the eddies by the emerging infinitesimal flow. For large
$\beta$, the dynamics of the S3T instability differs for zonal and non-zonal
flows but in both the destabilizing vorticity fluxes decrease with increasing
$\beta$. Shearing of the eddies by the mean flow continues to be the mechanism
for the emergence of zonal jets while non-zonal large-scale flows emerge from
resonant and near resonant triad interactions between the large-scale flow and
the stochastically forced eddies. The relation between the formation of
large-scale structure through modulational instability and the S3T instability
of the homogeneous state is also investigated and it is shown that the
modulational instability results are subsumed by the S3T results.

linear optics elements and photodetectors to perform Bell-state measurements
(BSMs). Conventionally, the success rate of these BSMs cannot exceed 50%, which
is an impediment for entanglement swapping between distant quantum memories.
Every time that a BSM fails, entanglement needs to be re-distributed between
the corresponding memories in the repeater link. The key ingredient in our
scheme is a repeatable BSM. Although it too relies only on linear optics and
photo-detection, it ideally allows us to repeat every BSM until it succeeds.
This, in principle, can turn a probabilistic quantum repeater into a
deterministic one. Under realistic conditions, where our measurement devices
are lossy, our repeatable BSMs may also fail. However, we show that by using
additional threshold detectors, we can improve the entanglement generation rate
between one and two orders of magnitude as compared to the probabilistic
repeater systems that rely on conventional BSMs. This improvement is sufficient
to make the performance of probabilistic quantum repeaters comparable with some
of existing proposals for deterministic quantum repeaters.

introduce the notion of `the Cayley graph $\mathcal{P}$ of the Weyl group

correspondence with the disjoint orbits of $W$. For a symmetric hyperbolic
generalized Cartan matrix $A$ of rank $\geq 4$ we prove that any 2 real roots

Cartan matrix $A$ contains zeros, then there are simple roots that are
stabilized by simple root reflections in $W$, that is, $W$ does not act simply
transitively on real roots. We give sufficient conditions in terms of the
generalized Cartan matrix $A$ (equivalently ${\mathcal D}$) for $W$ to
stabilize a real root. Using symmetry properties of the imaginary light cone in

  of Complex Networks","arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:1307.3625",,,,"cs.SI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The degree distribution is an important characteristic of complex networks.
In many data analysis applications, the networks should be represented as
fixed-length feature vectors and therefore the feature extraction from the
degree distribution is a necessary step. Moreover, many applications need a
similarity function for comparison of complex networks based on their degree
distributions. Such a similarity measure has many applications including
classification and clustering of network instances, evaluation of network
sampling methods, anomaly detection, and study of epidemic dynamics. The
existing methods are unable to effectively capture the similarity of degree
distributions, particularly when the corresponding networks have different
sizes. Based on our observations about the structure of the degree
distributions in networks over time, we propose a feature extraction and a
similarity function for the degree distributions in complex networks. We
propose to calculate the feature values based on the mean and standard
deviation of the node degrees in order to decrease the effect of the network
size on the extracted features. The proposed method is evaluated using
different artificial and real network datasets, and it outperforms the state of
the art methods with respect to the accuracy of the distance function and the
effectiveness of the extracted features.

character on the fundamental group of their complements. It is derived from the
peripheral structure on the group induced by the inclusion map of the boundary
of a tubular neigborhood in the exterior of the arrangement. By similarity with
knot theory, it can be viewed as an analogue of linking numbers. This is an
orientation-preserving invariant for ordered arrangements. We give an explicit
method to compute the invariant from the equations of the arrangement, by using
wiring diagrams introduced by Arvola, that encode the braid monodromy.
Moreover, this invariant is a crucial ingredient to compute the depth of a
character satisfying some resonant conditions, and complete the existent
methods by Libgober and the first author. Finally, we compute the invariant for
extended MacLane arrangements with an additional line and observe that it takes
different values for the deformation classes.

formation time and lifetime of a magnetic flux rope in a decaying bipolar
active region. We apply a magnetic flux transport model to prescribe the
evolution of the stellar photospheric field, and use this to drive the
evolution of the coronal magnetic field via a magnetofrictional technique.
Increasing the differential rotation (i.e. decreasing the equator-pole lap
time) decreases the flux rope formation time. We find that the formation time
is dependent upon the geometric mean of the lap time and the surface diffusion
timescale. In contrast, the lifetime of flux ropes are proportional to the lap
time. With this, flux ropes on stars with a differential rotation of more than
eight times the solar value have a lifetime of less than two days. As a
consequence, we propose that features such as solar-like quiescent prominences
may not be easily observable on such stars, as the lifetimes of the flux ropes
which host the cool plasma are very short. We conclude that such high
differential rotation stars may have very dynamical coronae.

M82 and NGC 253 suggests that starburst galaxies are huge reservoirs of cosmic

report the search for high-energy gamma-ray emission from several nearby
star-forming and starburst galaxies using the 68 month data obtained with the
Fermi Large Area Telescope. We found a $\sim5.5\sigma$ detection of gamma-ray

location of the luminous infrared galaxy NGC~2146. Taking into account also the
temporal and spectral properties of the gamma-ray emission, we suggest that the
gamma-ray source is likely to be the counterpart of NGC~2146. The gamma-ray
luminosity suggests that cosmic rays in NGC~2146 convert most of their energy
into secondary pions, so NGC~2146 is a ""proton calorimeter"". It is also found
that NGC~2146 obeys the quasi-linear scaling relation between the gamma-ray
luminosity and total infrared luminosity for star-forming galaxies,
strengthening the connection between massive star formation and gamma-ray
emission of star-forming galaxies. Possible TeV emission from NGC~2146 is
predicted and the implications for high-energy neutrino emission from starburst

  Linear Multifractional Stable Motion",,,,,"math.ST math.PR stat.TH","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Since the middle of the 90's, multifractional processes have been introduced
for overcoming some limitations of the classical Fractional Brownian Motion
model. In their context, the Hurst parameter becomes a Holder continuous
function H(?) of the time variable t. Linear Multifractional Stable Motion
(LMSM) is the most known one of them with heavy-tailed distributions. Generally
speaking, global and local sample path roughness of a multifractional process
are determined by values of its parameter $H(\cdot)$; therefore, since about
two decades, several authors have been interested in their statistical
estimation, starting from discrete variations of the process. Because of
complex dependence structures of variations, in order to show consistency of
estimators one has to face challenging problems. The main goal of our article
is to introduce, in the setting of the symmetric alpha-stable non-anticipative
moving average LMSM, where $\alpha \in (1; 2)$, a new strategy for dealing with
such kind of problems. It can also be useful in other contexts. In contrast
with previously developed strategies, this new one does not require to look for
sharp estimates of covariances related to functionals of variations. Roughly
speaking, it consists of expressing variations in such a way that they become
independent random variables up to negligible remainders. Thanks to it, we
obtain, an almost surely and $L^p(\Omega), p\in(0; 4]$, consistent estimator of
the whole function $H(\cdot)$, which converges, uniformly in t, and even for
some Holder norms. Also, we obtain estimates for the rates of convergence.
Such kind of strong consistency results in uniform and Holder norms are rather
unusual in the literature on statistical estimation of functions.

data types in order to identify lines that have desirable characteristics which
are suitable to be taken forward in plant breeding programmes. There are a
number of key morphological and physiological traits such as disease resistance
and yield that are required to be maintained, and improved upon if a commercial
variety is to be successful. Computational tools that provide the ability to
pull this data together, and integrate with pedigree structure, will enable
breeders to make better decisions on which plant lines are used in crossings to
meet both critical demands for increased yield/production and adaptation to
climate change. Results: We have used a large and unique set of experimental
barley (H. vulgare) data to develop a prototype pedigree visualization system
and performed a subjective user evaluation with domain experts to guide and
direct the development of an interactive pedigree visualization tool which we
have called Helium. Conclusions: We show that Helium allows users to easily
integrate a number of data types along with large plant pedigrees to offer an
integrated environment in which they can explore pedigree data. We have also
verified that users were happy with the abstract representation of pedigrees
