but not in open clusters. Cluster mass seems to play a key role in the
existence of multiple populations.
  Studying the chemical homogeneity of the most massive open clusters is
necessary to better understand the mechanism of their formation and determine
the mass limit under which clusters cannot host multiple populations. Here we
studied NGC6705, that is a young and massive open cluster located towards the
inner region of the Milky Way. This cluster is located inside the solar circle.
This makes it an important tracer of the inner disk abundance gradient. This
study makes use of BVI and ri photometry and comparisons with theoretical
isochrones to derive the age of NGC6705. We study the density profile of the
cluster and the mass function to infer the cluster mass. Based on abundances of
the chemical elements distributed in the first internal data release of the
Gaia-ESO Survey, we study elemental ratios and the chemical homogeneity of the
red clump stars. Radial velocities enable us to study the rotation and internal
kinematics of the cluster.
  The estimated ages range from 250 to 316Myr, depending on the adopted stellar
model. Luminosity profiles and mass functions show strong signs of mass
segregation. We derive the mass of the cluster from its luminosity function and
from the kinematics, finding values between 3700 M$_{\odot}$ and 11 000
M$_{\odot}$. After selecting the cluster members from their radial velocities,
we obtain a metallicity of [Fe/H]=0.10$\pm$0.06 based on 21 candidate members.
Moreover, NGC6705 shows no sign of the typical correlations or
anti-correlations between Al, Mg, Si, and Na, that are expected in multiple
populations. This is consistent with our cluster mass estimate, which is lower
than the required mass limit proposed in literature to develop multiple
populations.

dominating dark energy on the evolution of cosmological structures. For this
aim, we introduce the minimally coupled scalar field dark energy model with the
Albrecht-Skordis potential which allows a sudden ephemeral domination of dark
energy component during the radiation or early matter era. The conventional
cosmological parameters in the presence of such an early dark energy are
constrained with WMAP and Planck cosmic microwave background radiation data
including other external data sets. It is shown that in the presence of such an
early dark energy the estimated cosmological parameters can deviate
substantially from the currently known $\Lambda\textrm{CDM}$-based parameters,
with best-fit values differing by several percents for WMAP and by a percent
level for Planck data. For the latter case, only a limited amount of dark
energy with episodic nature is allowed since the Planck data strongly favors
the $\Lambda\textrm{CDM}$ model. Compared with the conventional dark energy
model, the early dark energy dominating near radiation-matter equality or at
the early matter era results in the shorter cosmic age or the presence of
tensor-type perturbation, respectively. Our analysis demonstrates that the
alternative cosmological parameter estimation is allowed based on the same
observations even in Einstein's gravity.

over strings, and are powerful modelling tools in a number of areas, including
natural language processing, software engineering, model checking,
bio-informatics, and pattern recognition. A common important question is that
of comparing the distributions generated or modelled by these grammars: this is
done through checking language equivalence and computing distances. Two PCFGs
are language equivalent if every string has identical probability with both
grammars. This also means that the distance (whichever norm is used) is null.
It is known that the language equivalence problem is interreducible with that
of multiple ambiguity for context-free grammars, a long-standing open question.
In this work, we prove that computing distances corresponds to solving
undecidable questions: this is the case for the L1, L2 norm, the variation
distance and the Kullback-Leibler divergence. Two more results are less
negative: 1. The most probable string can be computed, and, 2. The Chebyshev

lossless data compression for efficient storage and transmission. We present a
novel lossless universal data compression algorithm that uses parallel
computational units to increase the throughput. The length-$N$ input sequence
is partitioned into $B$ blocks. Processing each block independently of the
other blocks can accelerate the computation by a factor of $B$, but degrades
the compression quality. Instead, our approach is to first estimate the minimum
description length (MDL) context tree source underlying the entire input, and
then encode each of the $B$ blocks in parallel based on the MDL source. With
this two-pass approach, the compression loss incurred by using more parallel
units is insignificant. Our algorithm is work-efficient, i.e., its
computational complexity is $O(N/B)$. Its redundancy is approximately
$B\log(N/B)$ bits above Rissanen's lower bound on universal compression
performance, with respect to any context tree source whose maximal depth is at
most $\log(N/B)$. We improve the compression by using different quantizers for
states of the context tree based on the number of symbols corresponding to
those states. Numerical results from a prototype implementation suggest that
our algorithm offers a better trade-off between compression and throughput than
competing universal data compression algorithms.

flip-graphs are infinite whenever the mapping class group of the surface (the
group of self-homeomorphisms up to isotopy) is infinite, and we can obtain
moduli spaces of flip-graphs by considering the flip-graphs up to the action of
the mapping class group. This always results in finite graphs and we are
interested in their geometry.

obtain general estimates that hold for all topological types of filling

providing statistically efficient Markov chain simulation. We reduce the cost
of forming the Fisher information matrix by using a low rank approximation via
a randomized singular value decomposition technique. This is efficient since a
small number of Hessian-vector products are required. The Hessian-vector
product in turn requires only two extra PDE solves using the adjoint technique.

before: dynamical backaction amplification of molecular vibrations. We first
map the problem onto the canonical model of cavity optomechanics, in which the
molecular vibration and the plasmon are \textit{parametrically coupled}. The
optomechanical coupling rate, from which we derive the Raman cross section, is
computed from the molecules Raman activities and the plasmonic field
distribution. When the plasmon decay rate is comparable or smaller than the
vibrational frequency and the excitation laser is blue-detuned from the plasmon
onto the vibrational sideband, the resulting delayed feedback force can lead to
efficient parametric amplification of molecular vibrations. The optomechanical
theory provides a quantitative framework for the calculation of enhanced
cross-sections, recovers known results, and enables the design of novel systems
that leverage dynamical backaction to achieve additional, mode-selective
enhancement. It yields a new understanding of plasmon-enhanced Raman scattering
and opens a route to molecular quantum optomechanics.

effect also plays a role for having the transition between two well known
motions, tumbling and tank-treading (TT) with the long axis oscillating about a
fixed inclination angle (a swinging mode), when varying the shear rate. The
intermittent region between tumbling and TT with a swinging mode of the capsule
with a biconcave rest shape has been obtained in a narrow range of the
capillary number. In such region, the dynamics of the capsule is a mixture of
tumbling and TT with a swinging mode; when having the tumbling motion, the
membrane tank-tread backward and forward within a small range. As the capillary
number is very close to and below the threshold for the pure TT with a swinging
mode, the capsule tumbles once after several TT periods in each cycle. The
number of TT periods in one cycle decreases with respect to the decreasing of
the capillary number, until the capsule has one tumble and one TT period
alternatively and such alternating motion exists over a range of the capillary
number; and then the capsule performs more tumbling between two consecutive TT
periods when reducing the capillary number further, and finally shows pure
tumbling. The critical value of the swelling ratio for having the intermittent

scenario, and propose an alternative approach based on a treatment of the
system as a pseudospin magnet. We show that the experimentally observed
tunneling peak can be linked to the XY ferromagnet (FM) to Ising
antiferromagnet (AFM) phase transition of the S=1/2 XXZ pseudospin model,
driven by the change in total electron density. This transition is accompanied
by a qualitative change in the nature of the low energy spin wave dispersion
from a gapless linear mode in the XY-FM phase to a gapped, quadratic mode in
the Ising-AFM phase.

method to characterize regions of repulsive gravity, associated to black holes
and naked singularities. Our method is based upon the behavior of the curvature
tensor eigenvalues, and leads to an invariant definition of a \emph{repulsion
radius}. The repulsion radius determines a physical region, which can be
interpreted as a repulsion sphere, where the effects due to repulsive gravity
naturally arise. Further, we show that the use of effective masses to
characterize repulsive regions can lead to coordinate-dependent results
whereas, in our approach, repulsion emerges as a consequence of the spacetime
geometry in a completely invariant way. Our definition is tested in the
spacetime of an electrically charged Kerr naked singularity and in all its
limiting cases. We show that a positive mass can generate repulsive gravity if
it is equipped with an electric charge or an angular momentum. We obtain
reasonable results for the spacetime regions contained inside the repulsion
sphere whose size and shape depend on the value of the mass, charge and angular
momentum. Consequently, we define repulsive gravity as a classical relativistic
effect by using the geometry of spacetime only.

flow relations for generalized Newtonian fluids in confined geometries. While
in the previous investigations we used the straight circular tube geometry with
eight fluid rheological models to demonstrate and establish the variational
method, the focus here is on the plane long thin slit geometry using those
eight rheological models, namely: Newtonian, power law, Ree-Eyring, Carreau,
Cross, Casson, Bingham and Herschel-Bulkley. We demonstrate how the variational
principle based on minimizing the total stress in the flow conduit can be used
to derive analytical expressions, which are previously derived by other
methods, or used in conjunction with numerical procedures to obtain numerical
solutions which are virtually identical to the solutions obtained previously
from well established methods of fluid dynamics. In this regard, we use the
method of Weissenberg-Rabinowitsch-Mooney-Schofield (WRMS), with our adaptation
from the circular pipe geometry to the long thin slit geometry, to derive
analytical formulae for the eight types of fluid where these derived formulae
are used for comparison and validation of the variational formulae and
numerical solutions. Although some examples may be of little value, the
optimization principle which the variational method is based upon has a
significant theoretical value as it reveals the tendency of the flow system to
assume a configuration that minimizes the total stress. Our proposal also
offers a new methodology to tackle common problems in fluid dynamics and
rheology.

It is usually assumed, explicitly or implicitly, that the label sets for

many real-world multi-label datasets, the label assignments for training
instances can be incomplete. Some ground-truth labels can be missed by the

the problem of large-scale multi-label learning with incomplete label

unlabeled stochastic gradient descent and stacked models. Unlike prior works,
our method can effectively and efficiently consider missing labels and label

commonly called open quantum systems, can be strongly affected by this
interaction. While this can lead to unwanted consequences, such as causing
decoherence in qubits used for quantum computation, it can also be exploited as
a probe of the environment. For example, magnetic resonance imaging is based on
the dependence of the spin relaxation times of protons in water molecules in a
host's tissue. Here we show that the excitation energy of a single spin, which
is determined by magnetocrystalline anisotropy and controls its stability and
suitability for use in magnetic data storage devices, can be modified by
varying the exchange coupling of the spin to a nearby conductive electrode.
Using scanning tunnelling microscopy and spectroscopy, we observe variations up
to a factor of two of the spin excitation energies of individual atoms as the
strength of the spin's coupling to the surrounding electronic bath changes.
These observations, combined with calculations, show that exchange coupling can
strongly modify the magnetic anisotropy. This system is thus one of the few
open quantum systems in which the energy levels, and not just the excited-state
lifetimes, can be controllably renormalized. Furthermore, we demonstrate that
the magnetocrystalline anisotropy, a property normally determined by the local
structure around a spin, can be electronically tuned. These effects may play a
significant role in the development of spintronic devices5 in which an
individual magnetic atom or molecule is coupled to conducting leads.

$\mathbb R^m$ with at most $\tau m$ nonzero coordinates, and $e$ is a random
noise vector in $\mathbb R^n$ with bounded magnitude. For the case $m=O(n)$,
our algorithm recovers every column of $A$ within arbitrarily good constant
accuracy in time $m^{O(\log m/\log(\tau^{-1}))}$, in particular achieving
polynomial time if $\tau = m^{-\delta}$ for any $\delta>0$, and time $m^{O(\log

comparable assumptions on the distribution required the vector $x$ to be much
sparser---at most $\sqrt{n}$ nonzero coordinates---and there were intrinsic
barriers preventing these algorithms from applying for denser $x$.
  We achieve this by designing an algorithm for noisy tensor decomposition that
can recover, under quite general conditions, an approximate rank-one
decomposition of a tensor $T$, given access to a tensor $T'$ that is
$\tau$-close to $T$ in the spectral norm (when considered as a matrix). To our
knowledge, this is the first algorithm for tensor decomposition that works in
the constant spectral-norm noise regime, where there is no guarantee that the
local optima of $T$ and $T'$ have similar structures.

phase does not vary significantly along the thin bridge, indicating that the
oscillations are likely to originate from the underneath. The slit taken along
the central axis of the wide light bridge exhibits a standing wave feature.
However, at the centre of the wide bridge, the 5-min oscillation power is found
to be stronger than at its sides. Moreover, the time-distance plot across the
wide bridge exhibits a herringbone pattern that indicates a counter-stream of
two running waves originated at the bridge sides.
  Thus, the 5-min oscillations on the wide bridge also resemble the properties
of running penumbral waves. The 5-min oscillations are suppressed in the umbra,
while the 3-min oscillations occupy all three cores of the sunspot's umbra,
separated by the LBs. The 3-min oscillations were found to be in phase at both
sides of the LBs. It may indicate that either LBs do not affect umbral
oscillations, or umbral oscillations at different umbral cores share the same
source. Also, it indicates that LBs are rather shallow objects situated in the
upper part of the umbra. We found that umbral flashes follow the life cycles of
umbral oscillations with much larger amplitudes. They cannot propagate across
LBs. Umbral flashes dominate the 3-min oscillation power within each core,
however, they do not disrupt the phase of umbral oscillation.

Performance at each party and the central observer is measured via the accuracy

the distortion between the true and the computed function value. Our main
result is the exact optimality of a simple non-interactive protocol: each party
randomizes (sufficiently) and publishes its own bit. In other words,
non-interactive randomized response is exactly optimal. Each party and the

the appropriate notion of their accuracy measure. The optimality is very
general: it holds for all types of functions, heterogeneous privacy conditions

rich club nodes, (i.e., highly interconnected, high degree hub nodes), in human
brain functional networks. The cognitive relevance of the detected modules and
hubs has also been demonstrated, for both task based and default mode networks,
suggesting that the brain self-organizes into patterns of co-activated sets of
regions for performing specific tasks or in resting state. In this paper, we
report studies on the resilience or robustness of this modular structure: under
systematic erosion of connectivity in the network under thresholding, how
resilient is the modularity and hub structure? The results show that the
network shows show strong resilience properties, with the modularity and hub
structure maintaining itself over a large range of connection strengths. Then,
at a certain critical threshold that falls very close to 0, the connectivity,
the modularity, and hub structure suddenly break down, showing a phase
transition like property. Additionally, the spatial and topological
organization of erosion of connectivity at all levels was found to be
homogenous rather than heterogenous; i.e., no ""structural holes"" of any
significant sizes were found, and no gradual increases in numbers of components
were detected. Any loss of connectivity is homogenously spread out across the
network. The results suggest that human task-based functional brain networks
are very resilient, where the whole network structure fails only when
connectivity is almost fully removed from the network. The findings may help
further the understanding of dynamics of and relationships between structural
and functional brain networks.

70-year-old. Presently, molecule-based devices are also considered for quantum

metal leads can perform the qubit-based logic operation. This is an interesting
question of why experimental progress is still very slow even when the scope of
molecule-based devices may govern the advancement of next-generation logic and
memory devices for the highest possible computer technologies. Molecules have
the potential to be unmatched device elements as chemists can mass-produce an
endless variety of molecules with novel optical, magnetic, and charge transport
characteristics. However, the biggest challenge is to connect two metal leads
to target molecules and develop a robust and versatile device fabrication
technology that can be adopted for commercial-scale mass production. This paper
discusses the distinct advantages of utilizing commercially successful magnetic
tunnel junctions as a vehicle for developing molecular electronics and
molecular spintronics devices. We describe the use of a tunnel junction with
the exposed sides as a testbed for molecular devices. On the exposed sides of a
tunnel, junction molecules are bridged across an insulator by chemically
bonding with the two metal electrodes; sequential growth of
metal-insulator-metal layers ensures that separation between two metal
electrodes is controlled by the insulator thickness to the molecular device
length scale. Here we also strongly emphasize a need for close collaboration
between chemists and magnetic tunnel junction researchers. Such partnerships
will have a strong potential to develop magnetic tunnel junction based
molecular devices for the futuristic areas such as memory devices, magnetic
metamaterials, and high sensitivity biosensors.

linear and logistic regression, require minimizing a convex function defined by
the data. Since the data may contain sensitive information about individuals,
and these analyses can leak that sensitive information, it is important to be
able to solve convex minimization in a privacy-preserving way.
  A series of recent results show how to accurately solve a single convex
minimization problem in a differentially private manner. However, the same data
is often analyzed repeatedly, and little is known about solving multiple convex
minimization problems with differential privacy. For simpler data analyses,
such as linear queries, there are remarkable differentially private algorithms
such as the private multiplicative weights mechanism (Hardt and Rothblum, FOCS
2010) that accurately answer exponentially many distinct queries. In this work,
we extend these results to the case of convex minimization and show how to give
accurate and differentially private solutions to *exponentially many* convex
minimization problems on a sensitive dataset.

out of wide range of applications, integral equations, multivariate statistics,
radial basis interpolation, etc., to name a few. \emph{The highlight of this
new fast direct solver is that the solver scales linearly in the number of
unknowns in all dimensions.} The solver, termed as Inverse Fast Multipole
Method (abbreviated as IFMM), works on the same data-structure as the Fast
Multipole Method (abbreviated as FMM). More generally, the solver can be
immediately extended to the class of hierarchical matrices, denoted as
$\mathcal{H}^2$ matrices with strong admissibility criteria (weak low-rank
structure), i.e., \emph{the interaction between neighboring cluster of
particles is full-rank whereas the interaction between particles corresponding
to well-separated clusters can be efficiently represented as a low-rank
matrix}. The algorithm departs from existing approaches in the fact that
throughout the algorithm the interaction corresponding to neighboring clusters
are always treated as full-rank interactions. Our approach relies on two major
ideas: (i) The $N \times N$ matrix arising out of FMM (from now on termed as
FMM matrix) can be represented as an extended sparser matrix of size $M \times
M$, where $M \approx 3N$. (ii) While solving the larger extended sparser
matrix, \emph{the fill-in's that arise in the matrix blocks corresponding to
well-separated clusters are hierarchically compressed}. The ordering of the
equations and the unknowns in the extended sparser matrix is strongly related
to the local and multipole coefficients in the FMM~\cite{greengard1987fast} and
\emph{the order of elimination is different from the usual nested dissection
approach}. Numerical benchmarks on $2$D manifold confirm the linear scaling of
the algorithm.

For each object we identify the long-wavelength emission in excess to the dust
thermal emission, attribute that to free-free disk emission, and thereby
compute an upper limit to the EUV reaching the disk. We find upper limits lower
than 10$^{42}$ photons/s for all sources without jets and lower than $5 \times
10^{40}$ photons/s for the three older sources in our sample. These latter
values are low for EUV-driven photoevaporation alone to clear out
protoplanetary material in the timescale inferred by observations. In addition,
our EUV upper limits are too low to reproduce the [NeII] 12.81 micron
luminosities from three disks with slow [NeII]-detected winds. This indicates
that the [NeII] line in these sources primarily traces a mostly neutral wind
where Ne is ionized by 1 keV X-ray photons, implying higher photoevaporative
mass loss rates than those predicted by EUV-driven models alone. In summary,
our results suggest that high-energy stellar photons other than EUV may
dominate the dispersal of protoplanetary disks around sun-like stars.

much more environmentally friendly than conventional internal combustion engine
(ICE) vehicles, their fuel can also be catered from diverse energy sources and
resources. However, they add significant load on the power grid as they become
widespread. The characteristics of this extra load follow the patterns of
people's driving behaviours. In particular, random parameters such as arrival
time and driven distance of the vehicles determine their expected demand
profile from the power grid. In this paper, we first present a model for
uncoordinated charging power demand of PHEVs based on a stochastic process and
accordingly we characterize the EV's expected daily power demand profile. Next,
we adopt different distributions for the EV's charging time following some
available empirical research data in the literature. Simulation results show
that the EV's expected daily power demand profiles obtained under the uniform,
Gaussian with positive support and Rician distributions for charging time are
identical when the first and second order statistics of these distributions are
the same. This gives us useful insights into the long-term planning for
upgrading power systems' infrastructure to accommodate PHEVs. In addition, the
results from this modelling can be incorporated into designing demand response

the modern conception of phases of matter. The global nature of topological

However, the non-locality of this ordering makes direct experimental studies an
outstanding challenge, even in the simplest model topological systems, and
interactions among the constituent particles adds to this challenge. Here we
demonstrate a novel dynamical method to explore topological phases in both
interacting and non-interacting systems, by employing the exquisite control
afforded by state-of-the-art superconducting quantum circuits. We utilize this
method to experimentally explore the well-known Haldane model of topological
phase transitions by directly measuring the topological invariants of the
system. We construct the topological phase diagram of this model and visualize
the microscopic evolution of states across the phase transition, tasks whose
experimental realizations have remained elusive. Furthermore, we developed a
new qubit architecture that allows simultaneous control over every term in a
two-qubit Hamiltonian, with which we extend our studies to an interacting
Hamiltonian and discover the emergence of an interaction-induced topological
phase. Our implementation, involving the measurement of both global and local
textures of quantum systems, is close to the original idea of quantum
simulation as envisioned by R. Feynman, where a controllable quantum system is
used to investigate otherwise inaccessible quantum phenomena. This approach

phase randomness was investigated experimentally by measuring the visibility of
interference. An asymmetric Mach-Zehnder interferometer was used to observe the
interference between adjacent pulses from a gain-switched distributed feedback
laser diode driven at 10 GHz. Low visibility was observed when the minimum
drive current was set far below the threshold, while the interference emerged
when the minimum drive current was close to the threshold. Theoretical
evaluation on the impact of the imperfect phase randomization provides target
values for the visibility to guarantee the phase randomness. The experimental
and theoretical results show that secure implementation of decoy BB84 protocol
is achievable even for the 10-GHz clock frequency, by using the laser diode
under proper operating conditions.

techniques, the partial observation context can be transformed into a full

signal processing, where the goal is to reconstruct an unknown signal from
partial indirect, and possibly noisy, measurements of it. A now standard method
for recovering the unknown signal is to solve a convex optimization problem
that enforces some prior knowledge about its structure. This has proved
efficient in many problems routinely encountered in imaging sciences,
statistics and machine learning. This chapter delivers a review of recent
advances in the field where the regularization prior promotes solutions
conforming to some notion of simplicity/low-complexity. These priors encompass
as popular examples sparsity and group sparsity (to capture the compressibility
of natural signals and images), total variation and analysis sparsity (to
promote piecewise regularity), and low-rank (as natural extension of sparsity
to matrix-valued data). Our aim is to provide a unified treatment of all these
regularizations under a single umbrella, namely the theory of partial
smoothness. This framework is very general and accommodates all low-complexity
regularizers just mentioned, as well as many others. Partial smoothness turns
out to be the canonical way to encode low-dimensional models that can be linear
spaces or more general smooth manifolds. This review is intended to serve as a
one stop shop toward the understanding of the theoretical properties of the
so-regularized solutions. It covers a large spectrum including: (i) recovery
guarantees and stability to noise, both in terms of $\ell^2$-stability and
model (manifold) identification; (ii) sensitivity analysis to perturbations of
the parameters involved (in particular the observations), with applications to
unbiased risk estimation ; (iii) convergence properties of the forward-backward
proximal splitting scheme, that is particularly well suited to solve the
corresponding large-scale regularized optimization problem.

whose demand for energy is inherently deferrable in time. Of interest is the
potential to leverage on such latent flexibility in demand to absorb
variability in power supplied from intermittent renewable generation. The
challenge, however, lies in designing incentives to reliably induce the desired
response in demand. With an eye to electric vehicle charging, we propose a
novel forward market for differentiated electric power services, where
consumers consent to deferred service of pre-specified loads in exchange for a
reduced per-unit price for energy. The longer a consumer is willing to defer,
the larger the reduction in price. The proposed forward contract provides a
guarantee on the aggregate quantity of energy to be delivered by a
consumer-specified deadline. Under the earliest-deadline-first (EDF) scheduling
policy, which is shown to be optimal for the supplier, we explicitly
characterize a non-discriminatory, deadline-differentiated pricing scheme that
yields an efficient competitive equilibrium between the supplier and consumers.
We further show that this efficient pricing scheme, in combination with EDF
scheduling, is incentive compatible (IC) in that every consumer would like to
reveal her true deadline to the supplier, regardless of the actions taken by
other consumers.

broken scale invariance at chiral restoration. In matter-free space, when the
vector mesons and the scalar meson -- whose masses are much greater than that
of the pion -- are integrated out, then the resulting KN coupling Lagrangian
consists of the leading chiral order ($O(p^1)$) Weinberg-Tomozawa term and the
next chiral order ($O(p^2)$) $\Sigma_{KN}$ term. In addressing kaon
condensation in dense nuclear matter in chiral perturbation theory (ChPT), one
makes an expansion in the ""small"" Fermi momentum $k_F$. We argue that in the
Wilsonian RG formalism with the Fermi-liquid fixed point, the expansion is on
the contrary in $1/k_F$ with the ""large"" Fermi momentum $k_F$. The
kaon-quasinucleon interaction resulting from integrating out the massive mesons
consists of a ""relevant"" term from the scalar exchange (analog to the
$\Sigma_{KN}$ term) and an ""irrelevant"" term from the vector-meson exchange
(analog to the Weinberg-Tomozawa term). It is found that the critical density
predicted by the latter approach, controlled by the relevant term, is three
times less than that predicted by chiral perturbation theory.

algebra, a new kind of quivers, as a tool independing upon the associated basic
algebra.
  In \cite{Li}, the notion of the natural quiver of an artinian algebra was
introduced and then was used to generalize the Gabriel theorem for non-basic
artinian algebras splitting over radicals and non-basic finite dimensional
algebras with 2-nilpotent radicals via pseudo path algebras and generalized
path algebras respectively.
  In this paper, firstly we consider the relationship between the natural
quiver and the ordinary quiver of a finite dimensional algebra. Secondly, the
generalized Gabriel theorem is obtained for radical-graded artinian algebras.
Moreover, Gabriel-type algebras are introduced to outline those artinian
algebras satisfying the generalized Gabriel theorem here and in \cite{Li}. For
such algebras, the uniqueness of the related generalized path algebra and
quiver holds up to isomorphism in the case when the ideal is admissible. For an
artinian algebra, there are two basic algebras, the first is that associated to
the algebra itself; the second is that associated to the correspondent
generalized path algebra. In the final part, it is shown that for a
Gabriel-type artinian algebra, the first basic algebra is a quotient of the
second basic algebra.
  In the end, we give an example of a skew group algebra in which the relation
between the natural quiver and the ordinary quiver is discussed.

the influence of two physical phenomena, interstellar magnetic fields and the
presence of interstellar dust grains on the observable shape of the bow shocks

  We find that the interstellar magnetic field, though too weak to restrict the
general shape of the bow shock, reduces the size of the instabilities that
would otherwise be observed in the bow shock of a red supergiant. The
interstellar dust grains, due to their inertia can penetrate deep into the bow
shock structure of a main sequence O-supergiant, crossing over from the ISM
into the stellar wind. Therefore, the dust distribution may not always reflect
the morphology of the gas. This is an important consideration for infrared
observations, which are dominated by dust emission.
  Our models clearly show, that the bow shocks of massive stars are useful
diagnostic tools that can used to investigate the properties of both the
stellar wind as well as the interstellar medium.

work has demonstrated the benefits of in-network content caching in a wired,

goal of minimizing overall content-access delay. Here, needed content may
always be accessed at a back-end server via the cellular infrastructure;
alternatively, content may also be accessed via cache-equipped ""cluster"" nodes
within the MANET. To access content, MANET nodes must thus decide whether to
route to in-MANET cluster nodes or to back-end servers via the cellular
infrastructure; the in-MANET cluster nodes must additionally decide which
content to cache. We model the cellular path as either i) a
congestion-insensitive fixed-delay path or ii) a congestion-sensitive path
modeled as an M/M/1 queue. We demonstrate that under the assumption of
stationary, independent requests, it is optimal to adopt static caching (i.e.,
to keep a cache's content fixed over time) based on content popularity. We also
show that it is optimal to route to in-MANET caches for content cached there,
but to route requests for remaining content via the cellular infrastructure for
the congestion-insensitive case and to split traffic between the in-MANET
caches and cellular infrastructure for the congestion-sensitive case. We
develop a simple distributed algorithm for the joint routing/caching problem

artefacts which seriously degrade the performance of 2D NOESY. In our previous
work [28], it is demonstrated that creation of such artefacts can be prevented
by incorporation of a perfect echo based broadband homo-nuclear decoupling
technique during t1 period that also allows chemical shift encoding. However,
such experiments have limited F1 resolution as the perfect echo based
decoupling remains efficient for interpulse delay 2{\tau} (=t1) short compared
to 1/J. A solution to this problem is provided in the present work where we
show that even a partial decoupling effect of a perfect echo block for extended
t1 period close to 1/2J greatly suppress the build up of antiphase content and
thereby enhances the sensitivity of corresponding NOE cross peaks. The partial
decoupling do lead to generation of partial ZQ coherence which is further
eliminated by application of a ZQ filter.

longitudinal correlation time and obtain their precise dependence on the

the results of our approach are in full agreement with those of the approach

very small barrier heights the transient dynamics plays a crucial role and has
to be taken into account explicitly. When this requirement is satisfied (as,
e.g, at the calculation of the longitudinal correlation time) we obtain
absolute identity of our results with the literature formula in the whole range

investigate the polarization properties of the synchrotron-self-Compton (SSC)
process from a highly relativistic jet. A magnetic-dominated, baryon-loaded jet
ejected from the central engine travels with a large Lorentz factor. Shells
with slightly different velocities collide with each other and produce shocks.
The shocks accelerate electrons to power-law distribution, and at the same
time, magnify the magnetic field. Electrons move in the magnetic field and
produce synchrotron photons. The synchrotron photons suffer from the Compton
scattering (CS) process and then are detected by an observer locating slightly
off-axis. We derive analytically the formulae of photon polarization in the SSC
process in two magnetic configurations: magnetic field in the shock plane and
perpendicular to the shock plane. We show that photons induced by the SSC
process can be highly polarized, with the maximum polarization $\Pi \sim 24\%$
in the energy band $[0.5,5]$ MeV. The polarization depends on the viewing
angles, peaking in the plane perpendicular to the magnetic field. In the energy
band $[0.05,0.5]$ MeV, in which most $\gamma$-ray polarimeters are active, the
polarization is about twice of that in the Thomson limit, reaching to $\Pi\sim
20\%$. This implies that the Klein-Nishina effect, which is often neglected in
literatures, should be carefully considered.

to possible non-nucleonic components of the deuteron wave function. To
accurately estimate the size of the nucleonic contribution, final-state
interactions (FSIs) need to be accounted for in calculations. We outline a
model that, based on the diffractive nature of the effective hadron-nucleon
interaction, uses the generalized eikonal approximation to model the FSIs in
the resonance region, taking into account the proton-neutron component of the
deuteron. The calculation uses a factorized model with a basis of three
resonances with mass $W<2$ GeV as the relevant set of effective hadron states
entering the final-state interaction amplitude for inclusive DIS. We present
results for the tensor asymmetry observable $A_{zz}$ for kinematics accessible
in experiments at Jefferson Lab and Hermes. For inclusive DIS, sizeable effects
are found when including FSIs for Bjorken $x>0.2$, but the overall size of
$A_{zz}$ remains small. For tagged spectator DIS, FSIs effects are largest at

phenomena in science. Bright low frequency terahertz (< 5THz) radiation
confined to a diffraction-limited spot size is a present hurdle due to the
broad bandwidth and long wavelengths associated with single-cycle terahertz
pulses as well as due to the lack of terahertz wavefront correctors. Here,
using a present-technology system, we employ a new concept of terahertz
wavefront manipulation and focusing optimization. We demonstrate a
spatio-temporal confinement of terahertz energy at its physical limits to the
least possible 3-dimensional light bullet volume of lambda cubic. This leads to
a new regime of extremely bright terahertz radiation reaching 40 PW/m2
intensity. The presented work is focused on the sub-5 THz range using small
aperture organic crystals DSTMS and OH1. The obtained peak field of up to 5
GV/m and 17 Tesla is order of magnitude higher than any reported single-cycle
field oscillation in the entire THz range from a laser-based system and
surpassing large scale accelerator systems. The presented results are foreseen
to have a great impact on future nonlinear terahertz applications in different

the relative energetic stabilities of different overlayer structures have shown
some differences with the experimental results. In the GGA calculations, the

management and proactive security tasks. However, lack of sufficient flow-level
measurements as well as potential anomalies pose major challenges towards this
goal. Leveraging the spatiotemporal correlation of nominal traffic, and the
sparse nature of anomalies, this paper brings forth a novel framework to map
out nominal and anomalous traffic, which treats jointly important network
monitoring tasks including traffic estimation, anomaly detection, and traffic
interpolation. To this end, a convex program is first formulated with nuclear
and $\ell_1$-norm regularization to effect sparsity and low rank for the
nominal and anomalous traffic with only the link counts and a {\it small}
subset of OD-flow counts. Analysis and simulations confirm that the proposed
estimator can {\em exactly} recover sufficiently low-dimensional nominal
traffic and sporadic anomalies so long as the routing paths are sufficiently
""spread-out"" across the network, and an adequate amount of flow counts are
randomly sampled. The results offer valuable insights about data acquisition
strategies and network scenaria giving rise to accurate traffic estimation. For
practical networks where the aforementioned conditions are possibly violated,
the inherent spatiotemporal traffic patterns are taken into account by adopting
a Bayesian approach along with a bilinear characterization of the nuclear and
$\ell_1$ norms. The resultant nonconvex program involves quadratic regularizers
with correlation matrices, learned systematically from (cyclo)stationary
historical data. Alternating-minimization based algorithms with provable
convergence are also developed to procure the estimates. Insightful tests with
synthetic and real Internet data corroborate the effectiveness of the novel
schemes.

meaning the frame potential to be optimized is a function on the manifold of
Gram matrices belonging to finite Parseval frames. Next to the known classes of
equal-norm and equiangular Parseval frames, we introduce equidistributed
Parseval frames, which are more general than the equiangular type but have more
structure than equal-norm ones. We also provide examples where this class
coincides with that of Grassmannian frames, the minimizers for the maximal
magnitude among inner products between frame vectors. These different types of
frames are characterized in relation to the optimization of frame potentials.
Based on results by Lojasiewicz, we show that the gradient descent for a real
analytic frame potential on the manifold of Gram matrices belonging to Parseval
frames always converges to a critical point. We then derive geometric
structures associated with the critical points of different choices of frame
potentials. The optimal frames for families of such potentials are thus shown
to be equal-norm, or additionally equipartitioned, or even equidistributed.

large interest in characterizing the community structures of real networks, not
enough attention has been devoted to the detection of universal mechanisms able
to spontaneously generate networks with communities. Triadic closure is a
natural mechanism to make new connections, especially in social networks. Here
we show that models of network growth based on simple triadic closure naturally
lead to the emergence of community structure, together with fat-tailed
distributions of node degree, high clustering coefficients. Communities emerge
from the initial stochastic heterogeneity in the concentration of links,
followed by a cycle of growth and fragmentation. Communities are the more
pronounced, the sparser the graph, and disappear for high values of link
density and randomness in the attachment procedure. By introducing a
fitness-based link attractivity for the nodes, we find a novel phase
transition, where communities disappear for high heterogeneity of the fitness
distribution, but a new mesoscopic organization of the nodes emerges, with
groups of nodes being shared between just a few superhubs, which attract most
of the links of the system.

a subset of vertices is a maximal stable set if and only if it is of total
weight $1$. In $1994$, Mahadev et al.~introduced a subclass of equistable
graphs, called strongly equistable graphs, as graphs such that for every $c \le
1$ and every non-empty subset $T$ of vertices that is not a maximal stable set,
there exist positive vertex weights such that every maximal stable set is of
total weight $1$ and the total weight of $T$ does not equal $c$. Mahadev et al.
conjectured that every equistable graph is strongly equistable. General
partition graphs are the intersection graphs of set systems over a finite
ground set $U$ such that every maximal stable set of the graph corresponds to a
partition of $U$. In $2009$, Orlin proved that every general partition graph is
equistable, and conjectured that the converse holds as well.
  Orlin's conjecture, if true, would imply the conjecture due to Mahadev,

the well-known Cantor fractal. The model allows us to explain a succession of
power-law decays and respectively, of generalized power-law decays
(superposition of maxima and minima on a power-law decay) with arbitrarily
decreasing scattering exponents in the range from zero to three. We show that
within the model, the present analysis allows us to obtain the edges of all the
fractal regions in the momentum space, the number of fractal iteration and the
fractal dimensions and scaling factors at each structural level in the fractal.
We applied our model to calculate an analytical expression for the radius of
gyration of the fractal. The obtained quantities characterizing the fat fractal
are correlated to variation of scaling factor with the iteration number.

stochastic processes in classical and quantum systems. However, there are many
physical examples where the dynamics is continuous and only approximately
discrete, or where it is favourable to discuss the dynamics on a discretized
and a continuous level in parallel. An example is the hindered motion of
particles through potential landscapes with barriers. In the present paper we
propose a consistent generalisation of the WTD from the discrete case to
situations where the particles perform continuous barrier-crossing
characterised by a finite duration. To this end, we introduce a recipe to
calculate the WTD from the Fokker-Planck/Smoluchowski equation. In contrast to
the closely related first passage time distribution (FPTD), which is frequently
used to describe continuous processes, the WTD contains information about the
direction of motion. As an application, we consider the paradigmatic example of
an overdamped particle diffusing through a washboard potential. To verify the
approach and to elucidate its numerical implications, we compare the WTD
defined via the Smoluchowski equation with data from direct simulation of the
underlying Langevin equation and find full consistency provided that the jumps
in the Langevin approach are defined properly. Moreover, for sufficiently large
energy barriers, the WTD defined via the Smoluchowski equation becomes
consistent with that resulting from the analytical solution of a (two-state)
master equation model for the short-time dynamics developed previous by us [PRE
86, 061135 (2012)]. Thus, our approach ""interpolates"" between these two types
of stochastic motion. We illustrate our approach for both symmetric systems and
systems under constant force.

Such rapid flares are theoretically challenging and several {models} have been
put forward to explain the fast variability. In this paper we continue the
discussion concerning the effects of non-linear, time-dependent synchrotron
self-Compton (SSC) cooling. In previous papers we were able to show that the
non-linearity{, introduced by a time-dependent electron injection,} has severe
consequences for both the spectral energy distribution (SED) and the
monochromatic synchrotron light curve. The non-linear cooling introduces novel
breaks in the SED, which are usually explained by complicated underlying
electron distributions, while the much faster cooling of the SSC process
{causes significant differences in the synchrotron light curves}. In this paper
we calculate the inverse Compton light curves, taking into account both the SSC
and the external Compton process. The light curves are calculated from the
monochromatic intensities by introducing the retardation due to the finite size
of the emission region and the geometry of the source. Even though some of the
obvious effects of the SSC cooling are washed out by the retardation, there are
still several observational constraints which could help to discriminate
between the non-linear and the usual linear models, such as different flux
states, temporal shapes or faster variability of the light curves at different
energies.

\alpha-nucleus potentials. The reactions 165Ho(\alpha,n) and 166Er(\alpha,n)
probe the optical model in a mass region where \gamma-process calculations
exhibit an underproduction of p nuclei which is not yet understood. Method: To
investigate the energy-dependent cross sections of the reactions
165Ho(\alpha,n) and 166Er(\alpha,n) close to the reaction threshold,
self-supporting metallic foils were irradiated with \alpha-particles using the
FN tandem Van de Graaff accelerator at University of Notre Dame. The induced
activity was determined afterwards by monitoring the specific \beta-decay
channels. Results: Hauser-Feshbach predictions with a widely used global
\alpha-potential describe the data well at energies where the cross sections
are almost exclusively sensitive to the \alpha-widths. Increasing discrepancies
appear towards the reaction threshold at lower energy. Conclusions: The tested
global \alpha-potential is suitable at energies above 14 MeV, while a
modification seems necessary close to the reaction threshold. Since the \gamma-
and neutron width show non-negligible impact on the predictions, complementary
data are required to judge whether or not the discrepancies found can to be
solely assigned to the \alpha-width.

(i) streaming model, where data arrives over time and one can use only a small
amount of storage, and (ii) query model, where we can structure the data in low
space and answer sampling queries. In this paper, we prove the following
results in above two settings:
  - In the streaming setting, we would like to maintain a random sample from
the elements seen so far. We prove that one can maintain a random sample using
$O(\log n)$ random bits and $O(\log n)$ space, where $n$ is the number of
elements seen so far. We can extend this to the case when elements have weights
as well.
  - In the query model, there are $n$ elements with weights $w_1, ..., w_n$
(which are $w$-bit integers) and one would like to sample a random element with
probability proportional to its weight. Bringmann and Larsen (STOC 2013) showed
how to sample such an element using $nw +1 $ space (whereas, the information
theoretic lower bound is $n w$). We consider the approximate sampling problem,
where we are given an error parameter $\varepsilon$, and the sampling
probability of an element can be off by an $\varepsilon$ factor. We give
matching upper and lower bounds for this problem.

(LBVs), which can show three types of variability. The LBV phase of evolution
is poorly understood, and the driving mechanisms for the variability are not
known. The most common type of variability, the S Dor instability, occurs on
timescales of tens of years. During an S Dor outburst, the visual magnitude of
the star increases, while the bolometric magnitude stays approximately
constant. In this work, we investigate pulsation as a possible trigger for the
S Dor type outbursts. We calculate the pulsations of envelope models using a
nonlinear hydrodynamics code including a time-dependent convection treatment.
We initialize the pulsation in the hydrodynamic model based on linear
non-adiabatic calculations. Pulsation properties for a full grid of models from
20 to 85 M$_{\odot}$ were calculated, and in this paper we focus on the few
models that show either long-period pulsations or outburst-like behaviour, with
photospheric radial velocities reaching 70-80 km/s. At the present time, our
models cannot follow mass loss, so once the outburst event begins, our
simulations are terminated. Our results show that pulsations alone are not able
to drive enough surface expansion to eject the outer layers. However, the
outbursts and long-period pulsations discussed here produce large variations in
effective temperature and luminosity, which are expected to produce large
variations in the radiatively driven mass-loss rates.

second order accurate and was validated in different ways. We use for
calibration an auxiliary 1D solver with the same initial and boundary
conditions and the same evolution algorithm. We reproduce the quasinormal modes
for the massless scalar field harmonics $\ell = 0$, $1$ and $2$. For these same
harmonics, in the linear approximation, we calculate the balance of energy
between the black hole and the world tube. As an example of nonlinear harmonic
generation, we show the distortion of a marginally trapped two-surface
approximated as a q-boundary and based upon the harmonic $\ell=2$.
Additionally, we study the evolution of the $\ell = 8$ harmonic in order to
test the solver in a spacetime with a complex angular structure. Further
applications and extensions are briefly discussed.

problem because of limited energy, bandwidth, and computational complexity.
While facing numerous threats these severely resource constrained nodes are
responsible for data collection, data processing, localization, time
synchronization aggregation and data forwarding. One of the effective
approaches to control and tolerate these threats is through clustering. In this
paper we present a new method called Efficient Fault Control Mechanism for
fault controlling in wireless sensor networks based on clustering and
cluster-head selection. Simulation results show Efficient Fault Control

arbitrary numbers of qubits in the sense of the maximal mixedness of the
one-qubit reduced density operator. A general criterion is provided to easily
identify whether given symmetric states are maximally entangled in that respect
or not. We show that these maximally entangled symmetric (MES) states are the
only symmetric states for which the expectation value of the associated
collective spin of the system vanishes, as well as in corollary the dipole
moment of the Husimi function. We establish the link between this kind of
maximal entanglement, the anticoherence properties of spin states, and the
degree of polarization of light fields. We analyze the relationship between the
MES states and the classes of states equivalent through stochastic local
operations with classical communication (SLOCC). We provide a nonexistence
criterion of MES states within SLOCC classes of qubit states and show in
particular that the symmetric Dicke state SLOCC classes never contain such MES
states, with the only exception of the balanced Dicke state class for even
numbers of qubits. The 4-qubit system is analyzed exhaustively and all MES
states of this system are identified and characterized. Finally the
entanglement content of MES states is analyzed with respect to the geometric
and barycentric measures of entanglement, as well as to the generalized
N-tangle. We show that the geometric entanglement of MES states is ensured to
be larger than or equal to 1/2, but also that MES states are not in general the
symmetric states that maximize the investigated entanglement measures.

near a 2D coronal null point is investigated. When a uniform plasma density is
considered, it is seen that an initially planar Alfv\'en wavefront remains
planar, despite the varying equilibrium Alfv\'en speed, and that all the wave
collects at the separatrices. Thus, in the non-ideal case, these Alfv\'enic
disturbances preferentially dissipate their energy at these locations. For a
non-uniform equilibrium density, it is found that the Alfv\'en wavefront is
significantly distorted away from the initially planar geometry, inviting the
possibility of dissipation due to phase mixing. Despite this however, we
conclude that for the Alfv\'en wave, current density accumulation and
preferential heating still primarily occur at the separatrices, even when an
extremely non-uniform density profile is considered.

highly pulsed in the X-ray domain, with a light curve characterized by two
sharp, asymmetrical peaks, separated by 0.5 in phase. We detected no
significant X-ray spectral changes during the pulsar phase. We extended the
available {\it Fermi} ephemeris to five years. We found two glitches. The
$\gamma$-ray lightcurve is characterized by two peaks, separated by 0.5 in
phase, with a bridge in between and no off-pulse emission. The spectrum shows
clear evolution in phase, being softer at the peaks and hardenning towards the
bridge. The X-ray peaks lag the $\gamma$-ray ones by 0.25 in phase. We found a
hint of detection in the 30-500 keV band with {\it INTEGRAL} IBIS/ISGRI, that
is consistent with the extrapolation of both the soft X-ray and $\gamma$-ray

marginal distribution of two ordered responses and their association, given a
set of covariates. When the number of categories of the responses increases,
the number of global odds ratios (or their re-parametrizations) to be estimated
also increases and estimating the association structure becomes crucial for
this type of data. In fact, such data could be too ""rich"" to be fully modelled
with an ordinary BOLM while, sometimes, the well-known Dale's model could be
too parsimonious to provide a good fit. In addition, when the cross-tabulation
of the responses contains some zeros, for a number of model configurations,
including the bivariate version of the partial proportional odds model (PPOM),
estimation of a BOLM by the Fisher-scoring algorithm may either fail or
estimate a too ""irregular"" association structure. In this work, we propose to
use a nonparametric approach for the maximum likelihood estimation of a BOLM.
We apply penalties to the differences between adjacent row and column effects.
As a result, estimation is less demanding than an ordinary BOLM, permitting the
fit of PPOMs and/or the smoothing of the marginal and association parameters by
polynomial curves and surfaces, with scores chosen by the data. Model selection
is based on the penalized log-likelihood ratio, whose limiting distribution has
been studied through simulations, and AIC. Our proposal is compared to the
Goodman's model and the Dale's model, in terms of goodness-of-fit and
parsimony, on a literature data set. Finally, an application on an original

that can be derived or inferred from a consideration of Bricard octahedra and
generalizations of Bricard octahedra. These flexible polyhedra are of genus 0
and 1, have dihedral angles all of which are non-constant under flexion, have
faces that exhibit self-intersections, have an indefinite number of faces and
have vertex motion that can treated as a function of a single variable.

  of a novel therapeutical strategy",,,,,"q-bio.QM","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Grade II gliomas are slowly growing primary brain tumors that affect mostly
young patients and become fatal after a few years. Current clinical handling
includes surgery as first line treatment. Cytotoxic therapies (radiotherapy RT
or chemotherapy QT) are used initially only for patients having a bad
prognosis. Therapies are administered following the 'maximum dose in minimum
time' principle, what is the same schedule used for high grade brain tumors.
Using mathematical models describing the growth of these tumors in response to
radiotherapy, we find that a extreme protraction therapeutical strategy, i.e.
enlarging substantially the time interval between RT fractions, may lead to a
better tumor control. Explicit formulas are found providing the optimal spacing
between doses in a very good agreement with the simulations of the full
three-dimensional mathematical model approximating the tumor spatio-temporal
dynamics. This idea, although breaking the well-stablished paradigm, has
biological meaning since in these slowly growing tumors it may be more
favourable to treat the tumor as the different tumor subpopulations move to
more sensitive phases of the cell cycle.

flocks of birds are metric free, i.e. they have no characteristic interaction
length scale. However, models that involve interactions between neighbours that
are assigned topologically are naturally invariant under spatial expansion,
supporting a continuous reduction in density towards zero, unless additional
cohesive interactions are introduced or the density is artificially controlled,
e.g. via a finite system size. We propose a solution that involves a
metric-free motional bias on those individuals that are topologically
identified to be on an edge of the swarm. This model has only two primary
control parameters, one controlling the relative strength of stochastic noise
to the degree of co-alignment and another controlling the degree of the
motional bias for those on the edge, relative to the tendency to co-align. We
find a novel power-law scaling of the real-space density with the number of
individuals N as well as a familiar order-to-disorder transition.

real plane into the complex plane. In doing so, the Cauchy-Riemann (C-R)
equations are interpreted as constraint conditions defining two distinct
domains where complex differentiation is permitted. It is shown each of these
domains contains an orbital angular momentum contribution plus an non-orbital
term that cancels out between them. It is further shown the field equations for
spinning quantum particles include C-R equations that restrict the particles to
a single complex constraint space. It is therefore proposed the non-orbital
term in the constraint space angular momentum is the source of the spin.
