formation of two tilted plane waves traveling in the external cavity with
opposite transverse components and alternating in time at every round-trip.
Each of these plane waves gives birth to a train of mode-locked pulses
separated by twice the external cavity round-trip, while the two trains are
time shifted by a round-trip. A large portion of the transverse section of the
device contributes to mode-locked emission leading to pulses of approximately 1

particularly in relation to problems arising in M-theory, such as selfdual
strings and the so-called (2,0) theory. This thesis will begin with a Nahm-like
construction for selfdual strings using loop space, the space of loops on
spacetime. This construction maps solutions of the Basu-Harvey equation, the
BPS equation arising in the description of multiple M2-branes, to solutions of
a selfdual string equation on loop space. Furthermore, all ingredients of the
construction reduce to those of the ordinary Nahm construction when
compactified on a circle with all loops restricted to those wrapping the
circle. The rest of this thesis, however, will not involve loop space. We will
see a Nahm-like construction for the case of infinitely many selfdual strings,
suspended between two M5-branes. This is possible since the limit taken renders
the fields describing the M5-branes abelian. This avoids the problem which the
rest of this thesis focuses on: What fields describe multiple M5-branes? The
answer is likely to involve higher gauge theory, a categorification of gauge
theory which describes the parallel transport of extended objects. Any theories
which involves 3-algebras, including current M2-brane models and the
Lambert-Papageorgakis M5-brane model, are examples of higher gauge theories.
Recently, a class of models with N=(1,0) supersymmetry have been found, with
significant overlap with algebraic structures in higher gauge theory. This
overlap suggests that the full N=(2,0) theory could involve semistrict
$L_\infty$-algebras. Finally, we will see some explicit selfdual string
solutions, which may fit into these frameworks.

Blazars are a subset of active galactic nuclei (AGN) with jets that
are oriented along our line of sight. Variability and spectral energy
distribution (SED) studies are crucial tools for understanding the physical
processes responsible for observed AGN emission.
  Aims. We report peculiar behaviour in the bright gamma-ray blazar PKS
1424-418 and use its strong variability to reveal information about the
particle acceleration and interactions in the jet. Methods. Correlation
analysis of the extensive optical coverage by the ATOM telescope and nearly
continuous gamma-ray coverage by the Fermi Large Area Telescope is combined
with broadband, time-dependent modeling of the SED incorporating supplemental
information from radio and X-ray observations of this blazar.
  Results. We analyse in detail four bright phases at optical-GeV energies.
These flares of PKS 1424-418 show high correlation between these energy ranges,
with the exception of one large optical flare that coincides with relatively
low gamma-ray activity. Although the optical/gamma-ray behaviour of PKS
1424-418 shows variety, the multiwavelength modeling indicates that these
differences can largely be explained by changes in the flux and energy spectrum
of the electrons in the jet that are radiating. We find that for all flares the
SED is adequately represented by a leptonic model that includes inverse Compton
emission from external radiation fields with similar parameters.
  Conclusions. Detailed studies of individual blazars like PKS 1424-418 during
periods of enhanced activity in different wavebands are helping us identify
underlying patterns in the physical parameters in this class of AGN.

surpass those at the Eddington limit later in the burst by factors of 2.6 to
3.1. We are able to explain both the short duration and the super-Eddington
flux by mildly relativistic outflow velocities of 0.1$c$ to 0.3$c$ subsequent
to the thermonuclear shell flashes on the neutron stars. These are the highest
velocities ever measured from any thermonuclear flash. The precursor rise times
are also exceptionally short: about 1 ms. This is inconsistent with predictions
for nuclear flames spreading laterally as deflagrations and suggests
detonations instead. This is the first time that a detonation is suggested for
such a shallow ignition column depth ($y_{\rm ign}$ = 10$^{10}$ g cm$^{-2}$).
The detonation would possibly require a faster nuclear reaction chain, such as
bypassing the alpha-capture on $^{12}$C with the much faster
$^{12}$C(p,$\gamma$)$^{13}$N($\alpha$,p)$^{16}$O process previously proposed.
We confirm the possibility of a detonation, albeit only in the radial
direction, through the simulation of the nuclear burning with a large nuclear
network and at the appropriate ignition depth, although it remains to be seen
whether the Zel'dovich criterion is met. A detonation would also provide the
fast flame spreading over the surface of the neutron star to allow for the
short rise times. (...) As an alternative to the detonation scenario, we
speculate on the possibility that the whole neutron star surface burns almost
instantly in the auto-ignition regime. This is motivated by the presence of 150
ms precursors with 30 ms rise times in some superexpansion bursts from 4U
1820-30 at low ignition column depths of ~10$^8$ g cm$^{-2}$.

identifies classical conformal blocks with twisted superpotentials and then
with Yang-Yang functions. In this paper the triple correspondence is studied in
the simplest, yet not completely understood case of pure SU(2) super-Yang-Mills
gauge theory. A missing element of that correspondence is identified with the
classical irregular block. Explicit tests provide a convincing evidence that
such a function exists. In particular, it has been shown that the classical
irregular block can be recovered from classical blocks on the torus and sphere
in suitably defined decoupling limits of classical external conformal weights.
These limits are ""classical analogues"" of known decoupling limits for
corresponding quantum blocks. An exact correspondence between the classical
irregular block and the SU(2) gauge theory twisted superpotential has been
obtained as a result of another consistency check. The latter determines the
spectrum of the 2-particle periodic Toda (sin-Gordon) Hamiltonian in accord
with the Bethe/gauge correspondence. An analogue of this statement is found
entirely within 2d CFT. Namely, considering the classical limit of the null
vector decoupling equation for the degenerate irregular block a celebrated
Mathieu's equation is obtained with an eigenvalue determined by the classical
irregular block. As it has been checked this result reproduces a well known
weak coupling expansion of Mathieu's eigenvalue. Finally, yet another new
formulae for Mathieu's eigenvalue relating the latter to a solution of certain
Bethe-like equation are found.

devices containing small, tightly packed antidots, which have optimal
performance in pristine lattices. Larger antidots display a range of effects
which strongly depend on their edge geometry. Antidot systems with armchair

elements are widely believed to be the predominant means by which regulatory
networks evolve, yet examples of regulatory network divergence due to
transcription factor (TF) variation have also been observed. To systematically
ascertain the extent to which TFs contribute to regulatory divergence, we
analyzed the evolution of the largest class of metazoan TFs, Cys2-His2 zinc
finger (C2H2-ZF) TFs, across 12 Drosophila species spanning ~45 million years
of evolution. Remarkably, we uncovered that a significant fraction of all
C2H2-ZF 1-to-1 orthologs in flies exhibit variations that can affect their
DNA-binding specificities. In addition to loss and recruitment of C2H2-ZF
domains, we found diverging DNA-contacting residues in ~47% of domains shared
between D. melanogaster and the other fly species. These diverging
DNA-contacting residues, found in ~66% of the D. melanogaster C2H2-ZF genes in
our analysis and corresponding to ~24% of all annotated D. melanogaster TFs,
show evidence of functional constraint: they tend to be conserved across
phylogenetic clades and evolve slower than other diverging residues. These same
variations were rarely found as polymorphisms within a population of D.
melanogaster flies, indicating their rapid fixation. The predicted
specificities of these dynamic domains gradually change across phylogenetic
distances, suggesting stepwise evolutionary trajectories for TF divergence.
Further, whereas proteins with conserved C2H2-ZF domains are enriched in
developmental functions, those with varying domains exhibit no functional
enrichments. Our work suggests that a subset of highly dynamic and largely
unstudied TFs are a likely source of regulatory variation in Drosophila and
other metazoans.

Josephson plasma waves in layered superconductors. We study theoretically the
reflection and transmission of terahertz waves through a finite-size
superconducting slab placed inside a rectangular waveguide with ideal-metal
walls. We assume that the superconducting layers are parallel to the waveguide
axis. We show that there exist two specific mutually-orthogonal polarizations
for waves which, in spite of the nonlinearity, reflect and transmit through the
superconductor \emph{independently}. The wave of the first polarization causes
a strong shielding current along the crystallographic \textbf{ab}-plane of the
superconductor. Therefore, this wave reflects nearly completely from the
superconductor and excites only an evanescent mode inside it. The wave of the
other polarization does not contain the electric field component parallel to
both the sample surface and the crystallographic \textbf{ab}-plane, and excites
much weaker shielding currents. Therefore, it partially reflects and partially
transmits through the sample. Moreover, this wave excites the nonlinear mode in
the layered superconductor, and the transmission coefficient of the
superconductor depends on the amplitude of the incident wave of this
polarization.On the basis of the discussed superposition principle, we suggest
a new method for solving nonlinear problems of waves interaction in layered
superconductors. Namely, it is reasonably to represent incident, reflected, and
transmitted waves of any polarizations as superpositions of the modes with the
two specific polarizations considered here, and then solve the problem
separately for these modes. We apply this method to the case of nonlinear
interaction and mutual transformation of the transverse electric and transverse
magnetic modes in layered superconductors.

modeling and optimization of such systems are complicated by the potential
interference coupling between active nodes. In this article, we give an
overview on different aspects of this problem. We show how prior knowledge of

some of those cases, the $k\omega$ diagram also reveals a new class of low

combined with the more recent modular localization principle, has led to a
significant conceptual and computational extension of renormalized perturbation
theory to interactions involving fields of higher spin. Traditionally the clash
between pointlike localization and the the Hilbert space was resolved by
passing to a Krein space setting which resulted in the well-known BRST gauge
formulation. Recently it turned out that maintaining a Hilbert space
formulation for interacting higher spin fields requires a weakening of
localization from point- to string-like fields for which the d=s+1 short
distance scaling dimension for integer spins is reduced to d=1 and and
renormalizable couplings in the sense of power-counting exist for any spin.
This new setting leads to a significant conceptual change of the relation of
massless couplings with their massless counterpart. Whereas e.g. the
renormalizable interactions of s=1 massive vectormesons with s<1 matter falls
within the standard field-particle setting, their zero mass limits lead to much
less understood phenomena as ""infraparticles"" and gluon/quark confinement. It
is not surprising that such drastic conceptual changes in the area of gauge
theories also lead to a radical change concerning the Higgs issue.

be tested. The effect in case (ii) is due a phase shift picked by unpaired
electrons upon encircling an odd number of fluxons. In principle, this effect
may lead to small modifications in Abrikosov lattices. While the AB forces
exist at extremely low temperatures, we find that thermal decoherence may
strongly suppress the topological force at experimentally pertinent finite
temperatures. It is suggested that both cases (i) and (ii) (as well as other
examples briefly sketched) are related to a quantum version of the
fluctuation-dissipation theorem.

describe the world. A local realist theory is one where physical properties are
defined prior to and independent of measurement, and no physical influence can
propagate faster than the speed of light. Quantum-mechanical predictions for
certain experiments violate the Bell inequality while a local realist theory
cannot, and this shows that a local realist theory cannot give those
quantum-mechanical predictions. However, because of unexpected circumstances or
""loopholes"" in available experiment tests, local realist theories can reproduce
the data from these experiments. This paper reviews such loopholes, what effect
they have on Bell inequality tests, and how to avoid them in experiment.
Avoiding all these simultaneously in one experiment, usually called a
""loophole-free"" or ""definitive"" Bell test, remains an open task, but is very
important for technological tasks such as device-independent security of
quantum cryptography, and ultimately for our understanding of the world.

(pore scale) incorporates a number of related processes, i.e. residual
trapping, trapping due to hysteresis of the relative permeability, and trapping
due to hysteresis of the capillary pressure. Additionally CO2 may be trapped in
heterogeneous media due to difference in capillary pressure entry points for
different materials (facies scale). The amount of CO2 trapped by these
processes depends upon a complex system of non-linear and hysteretic
relationships including how relative permeability and capillary pressure vary
with brine and CO2 saturation, and upon the spatial variation in these
relationships as caused by geologic heterogeneity. Geological heterogeneities
affect the dynamics of CO2 plumes in subsurface environments. Recent studies
have led to new conceptual and quantitative models for sedimentary architecture
in fluvial deposits over a range of scales that are relevant to the performance
of some deep saline reservoirs. We investigated how the dynamics of a CO2
plume, during and after injection, is influenced by the hierarchical and
multi-scale stratal architecture in such reservoirs. The results strongly
suggest that representing small scales features (decimeter to meter), including
their organization within a hierarchy of larger-scale features, is critical to

the NIR range, from 0.9 to 2.5 micron. The observations were designed to detect
new DIBs, confirm previously proposed NIR DIBs, and characterise their
behaviour with respect to known line-of-sight properties (including the optical
DIBs present in our spectra). X-shooter at the VLT was used to obtained
medium-resolution spectra of eight known DIB targets and one telluric reference
star. In addition to the known 9577, 9632, 10780, 11797, and 13175 Angstroms
NIR DIBs, we confirm 9 out of the 13 NIR DIBs that were presented by Geballe
and co-workers in 2011. Furthermore, we report 12 new NIR DIB candidates. The
strengths of the strongest NIR DIBs show a general correlation with reddening,
E(B-V), but with a large scatter. Several NIR DIBs are more strongly correlated
with the 5780 Angstroms DIB strength than with E(B-V); this is especially the
case for the 15268 Angstroms DIB. The NIR DIBs are strong: the summed
equivalent widths of the five strongest NIR DIBs represent a few percent of the
total equivalent width of the entire average DIB spectrum (per unit reddening).
The NIR DIBs towards the translucent cloud HD 147889 are all weak with respect
to the general trend. No direct match was found between observed NIR DIBs and
laboratory matrix-isolation spectroscopic data of PAHs. The strong correlation
between the 5780-15268 DIB pair implies that (Nf)_5780 / (Nf)_15268 = 14.
However, the reduced strength of the 15268 Angstroms DIB in HD 147889 rules out
a common carrier for these two DIBs. Since the ionisation fraction for small
PAHs in this translucent cloud is known to be low compared to diffuse clouds,
the weakness of the 15268 Angstrom DIB suggests that an ionised species could
be the carrier of this NIR DIB. (abridged).

lithography, heavily-doped superconducting regions within a single crystal
could be constructed. We describe the characteristic parameters of basic

estimate the values for boron-doped silicon. The epitaxial, single-crystal

down to the single-atom scale, may enable lower-noise or new types of devices

inductance of these materials. Building on this, we explore how kinetic
inductance based particle detectors (e.g., photon or phonon) could be realized

devices (such as in silicon, germanium, or diamond) which would not require
atomistic fabrication approaches and could be realized today.

characterize the topological structures arising in a coevolutionary network
subject to an adaptive rewiring process and a node dynamics given by a simple
voterlike rule. We find that, for some values of the parameters describing the
adaptive rewiring process, a community structure emerges on a connected
network. We show that the emergence of communities is associated to a decrease
in the number of active links in the system, i.e. links that connect two nodes
in different states. The lifetime of the community structure state scales
exponentially with the size of the system. Additionally, we find that a small
noise in the node dynamics can sustain a diversity of states and a community
structure in time in a finite size system. Thus, large system size and/or local
noise can explain the persistence of communities and diversity in many real
systems.

bias and its scale dependence for a range of redshifts and halo masses in a
standard $\Lambda$LCDM cosmology. Assuming bias converges to a scale
independent form at large scales, we develop a phenomenological model which
fully expresses the mass and redshift dependence of bias and its scale
dependence in real or redshift space. We then use this to illustrate how
scale-dependent bias can systematically skew measurements of the growth-rate of
cosmic structure obtained from redshift-space distortion measurements. When
data is fit only to scales $k_{\rm max}{\le}0.1$ $[h^{-1} \rm{Mpc}]^{-1}$, we
find that these effects are significant only for large biases ($b{\gtrsim}3$)
at large redshifts ($z{\gtrsim}1$). However, when smaller scales are
incorporated ($k_{\rm max}{\le}0.2$ $[h^{-1} \rm{Mpc}]^{-1}$) to increase
measurement precision, the combination of reduced statistical uncertainty and
increased scale dependent bias can result in highly significant systematics for
most large halos across all redshifts. We identify several new interesting
aspects of bias, including a significant large-scale bias boost for small halos
at low-redshifts due to substructure effects ($\sim$20\% for Milky Way-like
systems) and a nearly redshift-independent halo mass (corresponding to a
redshift-space bias of ${\sim}1.5$) for which halo bias has little-or-no scale
dependence on scales greater than $3$ $[h^{-1} {\rm Mpc}]$. This suggests an
optimal strategy of targeting bias ${\sim}{1.5}$ systems for clustering studies
which are dominated by systematic uncertainties in how observed halo (or
galaxy) distributions map to their underlying mass distribution, such as
cosmological measurements of neutrino masses. Code for generating our fitting

matter subhaloes are found to be preferentially accreted along the principal
axis of the shear tensor which corresponds to the direction of weakest
collapse. We examine the dependence of this preferential infall on subhalo
mass, host halo mass and redshift. Although strongest for the most massive
hosts and the most massive subhaloes at high redshift, the preferential infall
of subhaloes is effectively universal in the sense that its always aligned with
the axis of weakest collapse of the velocity shear tensor. It is the same shear
tensor that dictates the structure of the cosmic web and hence the shear field
emerges as the key factor that governs the local anisotropic pattern of
structure formation. Since the small (sub-Mpc) scale is strongly correlated
with the mid-range (~10 Mpc) scale - a scale accessible by current surveys of
peculiar velocities - it follows that findings presented here open a new window

extragalactic predictions provide a better agreement, however are still strong
discrepancies with the low-latitude detection rate at a confidence of 99.69%

optimum skew-spectra for various models of primordial non-Gaussianity as well
as secondary bispectra that originate from the cross-correlation of secondaries
and lensing of CMB: coupling of lensing with the Integrated Sachs-Wolfe (ISW)
effect, coupling of lensing with thermal Sunyaev-Zeldovich (tSZ), as well as
from unresolved point-sources (PS). For joint estimation of various types of

maps. Bias induced in the estimation of primordial non-Gaussianity due to
secondary non-Gaussianity is evaluated. The PCA approach allows one to infer

selective bond formation between predetermined pairs of patches. By using MD
simulations, we compare the local connectivity, the bond orientation order, and
other structural properties of the aggregates formed by the ""colored"" and
""colorless"" systems. The analysis is done for spherical particles with two
different patch arrangements (tetrahedral and cubic). It is found that the
aggregated (liquid) phase of the ""colorless"" patchy particles is better
connected, denser and typically has stronger local order than the corresponding
""colored"" one. This, in turn, makes the colored liquid less stable
thermodynamically. Specifically, we predict that in a typical case the
chromatic interactions should increase the relative stability of the

polynomially terminating using polynomials with rational coefficients only. He

  Frontier",,,,,"cs.GT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In many multiagent scenarios, agents distribute resources, such as time or
energy, among several tasks. Having completed their tasks and generated
profits, task payoffs must be divided among the agents in some reasonable
manner. Cooperative games with overlapping coalitions (OCF games) are a recent
framework proposed by Chalkiadakis et al. (2010), generalizing classic
cooperative games to the case where agents may belong to more than one
coalition. Having formed overlapping coalitions and divided profits, some
agents may feel dissatisfied with their share of the profits, and would like to
deviate from the given outcome. However, deviation in OCF games is a
complicated matter: agents may decide to withdraw only some of their weight
from some of the coalitions they belong to; that is, even after deviation, it
is possible that agents will still be involved in tasks with non-deviators.
This means that the desirability of a deviation, and the stability of formed
coalitions, is to a great extent determined by the reaction of non-deviators.
In this work, we explore algorithmic aspects of OCF games, focusing on the core
in OCF games. We study the problem of deciding if the core of an OCF game is
not empty, and whether a core payoff division can be found in polynomial time;
moreover, we identify conditions that ensure that the problem admits polynomial
time algorithms. Finally, we introduce and study a natural class of OCF games,
Linear Bottleneck Games. Interestingly, we show that such games always have a
non-empty core, even assuming a highly lenient reaction to deviations.

preserving public health and industrial growth. Despite the ubiquity of these
urban systems, aging infrastructure, and increased risk of terrorism, decision
support models for a timely and adaptive contamination emergency response still
remain at an undeveloped stage. Emergency response is characterized as a
progressive, interactive, and adaptive process that involves parallel
activities of processing streaming information and executing response actions.
This study develops a dynamic decision support model that adaptively simulates
the time-varying emergency environment and tracks changing best health
protection response measures at every stage of an emergency in real-time.
Feedback mechanisms between the contaminated network, emergency managers, and
consumers are incorporated in a dynamic simulation model to capture
time-varying characteristics of an emergency environment. An
evolutionary-computation-based dynamic optimization model is developed to
adaptively identify time-dependant optimal health protection measures during an
emergency. This dynamic simulation-optimization model treats perceived
contaminant source attributes as time-varying parameters to account for
perceived contamination source updates as more data stream in over time.
Performance of the developed dynamic decision support model is analyzed and
demonstrated using a mid-size virtual city that resembles the dynamics and
complexity of real-world urban systems. This adaptive emergency response
optimization model is intended to be a major component of an all-inclusive
cyberinfrastructure for efficient contamination threat management, which is
currently under development.

  dimensions","25pp. A revised version: a remark, a lemma, and a theorem have been
  added",,,,"math.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We prove an incidence theorem for points and planes in the projective space
$\mathbb P^3$ over any field $\mathbb F$, whose characteristic $p\neq 2.$ An
incidence is viewed as an intersection along a line of a pair of two-planes
from two canonical rulings of the Klein quadric. The Klein quadric can be
traversed by a generic hyperplane, yielding a line-line incidence problem in a
three-quadric, the Klein image of a regular line complex. This hyperplane can
be chosen so that at most two lines meet. Hence, one can apply an algebraic
theorem of Guth and Katz, with a constraint involving $p$ if $p>0$.
  This yields a bound on the number of incidences between $m$ points and $n$
planes in $\mathbb P^3$, with $m\geq n$ as $$O\left(m\sqrt{n}+ m k\right),$$
where $k$ is the maximum number of collinear planes, provided that $n=O(p^2)$
if $p>0$. Examples show that this bound cannot be improved without additional
assumptions.
  This gives one a vehicle to establish geometric incidence estimates when
$p>0$. For a non-collinear point set $S\subseteq \mathbb F^2$ and a
non-degenerate symmetric or skew-symmetric bilinear form $\omega$, the number
of distinct values of $\omega$ on pairs of points of $S$ is
$\Omega\left[\min\left(|S|^{\frac{2}{3}},p\right)\right]$. This is also the
best known bound over $\mathbb R$, where it follows from the
Szemer\'edi-Trotter theorem. Also, a set $S\subseteq \mathbb F^3$, not
supported in a single semi-isotropic plane contains a point, from which

The authentication process depends on two key steps: feature extraction and
outlier detection. In this paper, a geometric tight frame and some simple
statistics of the tight frame coefficients are used to extract features from
the paintings. Then a forward stage-wise rank boosting is used to select a
small set of features for more accurate classification so that van Gogh
paintings are highly concentrated towards some center point while forgeries are
spread out as outliers. Numerical results show that our method can achieve
86.08% classification accuracy under the leave-one-out cross-validation
procedure. Our method also identifies five features that are much more
predominant than other features. Using just these five features for
classification, our method can give 88.61% classification accuracy which is the
highest so far reported in literature. Evaluation of the five features is also
performed on two hundred datasets generated by bootstrap sampling with
replacement. The median and the mean are 88.61% and 87.77% respectively. Our
results show that a small set of statistics of the tight frame coefficients
along certain orientations can serve as discriminative features for van Gogh
paintings. It is more important to look at the tail distributions of such
directional coefficients than mean values and standard deviations. It reflects
a highly consistent style in van Gogh's brushstroke movements, where many
forgeries demonstrate a more diverse spread in these features.

processors to return bogus results for tasks with certain probabilities, and
may cause a subset $F$ of the initial set of processors $P$ to crash. The
adversary is constrained in two ways. First, for the set of non-crashed
processors $P-F$, the \emph{average} probability of a processor returning a
bogus result is inferior to $\frac{1}{2}$. Second, the adversary may crash a

adversaries that are much stronger than previously studied. Our randomized
synchronous algorithm is formulated for $n$ processors and $t$ tasks, with

to terminate dynamically with the knowledge that the problem is solved with

round complexity of the algorithm is
$O(\frac{t}{n^\varepsilon}\log{n}\log{\log{n}})$, its work is $O(t\log{n}

massive surveys such as LSST. A challenge for classifiers in the context of
neural-net training and massive data sets is to minimize the number of
parameters required to describe each light curve. We show that a simple and
fast geometric representation that encodes the overall light curve shape,
together with a chi-square parameter to capture higher-order morphology
information results in efficient yet robust light curve classification,
especially for eclipsing binaries. Testing the classifier on the ASAS light
curve database, we achieve a retrieval rate of 98\% and a false-positive rate
of 2\% for eclipsing binaries. We achieve similarly high retrieval rates for
most other periodic variable-star classes, including RR Lyrae, Mira, and delta
Scuti. However, the classifier currently has difficulty discriminating between
different sub-classes of eclipsing binaries, and suffers a relatively low
($\sim$60\%) retrieval rate for multi-mode delta Cepheid stars. We find that it
is imperative to train the classifier's neural network with exemplars that
include the full range of light curve quality to which the classifier will be
expected to perform; the classifier performs well on noisy light curves only
when trained with noisy exemplars. The classifier source code, ancillary

applying the theory of compressed sensing. The relation between the hybrid and

data on the inter-residue separations for 36 pairs of residues in five IDPs:
$\alpha$-, $\beta$-, and $\gamma$-synuclein, the microtubule-associated protein

recapitulate the average inter-residue separations regardless of the choice of
the hydrophobicity scale, which shows that our calibrated model can robustly
capture the conformational dynamics of IDPs. We then employ our model to study
the scaling of the radius of gyration with chemical distance in 11 known IDPs.
We identify a strong correlation between the distance to the dividing line

of the calculation. Because of nucleus as a toy model hence the fission process
does not represent real fission process in nature completely. Fission event is
modeled by one random number. The number is assumed as width of distribution
probability of nucleon position in compound nuclei when fission process is
started. The toy model is formed by Gaussian distribution of random number that
randomizes distance like between particle and central point. The scission
process is started by smashing compound nucleus central point into two parts
that are left central and right central points. These three points have
different Gaussian distribution parameters such as mean ({\mu}CN, {\mu}L,
{\mu}R), and standard deviation ({\sigma}CN, {\sigma}L ,{\sigma}R). By
overlaying of three distributions, the number of particles ( NL, NR) that they
are trapped by central points is obtained. This process is iterated until ( NL,
NR) become constant numbers. The yield is determined from portion of nuclei
distribution which is proportional with portion of mass numbers. Smashing

introduce a general classification-based approximate policy iteration (CAPI)

regularities of both the value function and the policy space, depending on what
is advantageous. This framework has two main components: a generic value
function estimator and a classifier that learns a policy based on the estimated
value function. We establish theoretical guarantees for the sample complexity
of CAPI-style algorithms, which allow the policy evaluation step to be
performed by a wide variety of algorithms (including temporal-difference-style
methods), and can handle nonparametric representations of policies. Our bounds
on the estimation error of the performance loss are tighter than existing
results. We also illustrate this approach empirically on several problems,

historical context in the work of Herz and to recognise such spaces as preduals
of spaces of intertwining operators of induced representations as suggested by
the work of Rieffel. This generalisation of Apq spaces involves considering
projective tensor products of Lp spaces of Banach space-valued functions (the
spaces of induced representations) and constructing a convolution of functions
of such spaces. Sufficient conditions for the existence of the integral of the
convolution are established. Most of this analysis depends upon an identity we
derive of Radon-Nikodym derivatives of measures on homogeneous spaces involved.
  The elements of the generalised Apq space are shown to be cross-sections of a
Banach semi-bundle over the double coset space corresponding to the groups from
which the representations are induced, and their properties are duly discussed.
In particular, the generalised form of the classical result Lp*Lq is a subset
of Lr; where 1/r = 1/p + 1/q - 1; is shown to be true in this situation. The
result that the Apq space is the predual of the space of intertwining operators
is then established, under the condition that the intertwining operators can be
approximated, in the ultraweak operator topology, by integral operators.

this paper, we pursue the possibility that the 3.5-keV X-ray arises from a late

have the mass of $O(100)$~GeV and whose mass splitting is about 3.5~keV. We
focus on the simplest case where there are two Majorana dark matter particles
and two charged scalars that couple with a standard model matter particle. By
assuming a hierarchical structure in the couplings of the two dark matter
particles and two charged scalars, it is possible to explain the 3.5-keV line
and realize the WIMP dark matter scenario at the same time. Since the effective
coupling of the two different Majorana dark matter particles and one photon
violates CP symmetry, the model always contains a new source of CP violation,
so the model's connection to the physics of electric dipole moments is
discussed. The model's peculiar signatures at the LHC are also studied. We show

(i.e. a single two-leg ladder) where we consider two forms of spin-Peierls (SP)
instabilities on the legs: columnar dimers (CD) and staggered dimers (SD). We
particularly examine the regime of parameters (corresponding to an intermediate
XXZ anisotropy) where the SP and rung coupling terms are equally relevant. In
both the CD and SD cases we find that the effective field theory describing the
system is a self-dual sine-Gordon model, which favors ordering and the opening
of a gap to excitations. The order parameter, which reflects the interplay
between the SP and rung interactions, represents a crystal of 4-spin plaquettes
on which longitudinal and transverse dimers are in a superposition. Depending
on the SP instability mode these plaquettes are closed or open, however both
types spontaneously break reflection symmetry across the ladder. The closed
plaquettes are stable, while the open plaquette-order is relatively fragile and
the corresponding gap may be tuned to zero under extreme conditions. We further
find that a first order transition occurs from the Plaquette order to a valence
bond crystal (VBC) of dimers on the legs. It is suggestive that in a higher
dimensional version of this system, this variety of distinct VBC states with
comparable energies leads to the formation of domains. Effectively
one-dimensional gapless spinon modes on domain boundaries can possibly account
for the experimental observation of a spin-liquid behavior in a physical
realization of the model.

nitrogen-vacancy centers (NV-) vs. applied magnetic field (magnetic spectrum)
was studied. A narrow line in zero magnetic field was discovered. The
properties of this line are considerably different from those of other narrow
magnetic spectrum lines. Its magnitude is weakly dependent of the orientation
of the single-crystal sample to the external magnetic field. This line is also
observed in a powdered sample. The shape of the line changes greatly when
excitation light polarization is varied. The magnitude of the line has a
non-linear relation to excitation light intensity. For low intensities this
dependence is close to a square law. To explain the mechanism giving rise to
this line in the magnetic spectrum, we suggest a model based on the
dipole-dipole interaction between different NV- centers.

{\mu}'' ~ 20 {\mu}'' on objects as faint as 11 mag ~ 13 mag in K band. This
contribution focuses on upgrades and characterizations carried out since then.
  The astrometric metrology was extended from the Coud\'e focus of the
Auxillary Telescopes to their secondary mirror, in order to reduce the baseline
instabilities and improve the astrometric performance. While carrying out this
extension, it was realized that the polarization retardance of the star
separator derotator had a major impact on both the astrometric metrology and
the fringe sensors. A local compensation of this retardance and the operation
on a symmetric baseline allowed a new astrometric commissioning. In October
2013, an improved astrometric performance of 160 {\mu}'' was demonstrated,
still short of the requirements. Instabilities in the astrometric baseline
still appear to be the dominating factor.
  In preparation to a review held in January 2014, a plan was developed to
further improve the astrometric and faint target performance of PRIMA
Astrometry. On the astrometric aspect, it involved the extension of the
internal longitudinal metrology to primary space, the design and implementation
of an external baseline metrology, and the development of an astrometric
internal fringes mode. On the faint target aspect, investigations of the
performance of the fringe sensor units and the development of an AO system
(NAOMI) were in the plan. Following this review, ESO decided to take a proposal
to the April 2014 STC that PRIMA be cancelled, and that ESO resources be
concentrated on ensuring that Gravity and Matisse are a success. This proposal
was recommended by the STC in May 2014, and endorsed by ESO.

probe dynamic phenomena that are currently inaccessible for inelastic neutron
scattering due to flux limitations. VOR is a short instrument by the standards
of the European Spallation Source (ESS), 30.2 m moderator to sample, and
provides instantaneous access to a broad dynamic range, 1 - 120 meV within each
ESS period. The short instrument length combined with the long ESS pulse width
enables a quadratic flux increase, even at longer wavelengths, by relaxing
energy resolution from $\Delta$E/E = 1% up to $\Delta$E/E = 7%. This is
impossible both on a long chopper spectrometer at the ESS and with instruments
at short pulsed sources. In comparison to current day chopper spectrometers,
VOR can offer an order of magnitude improvement in flux for equivalent energy
resolutions, $\Delta$E/E = 1-3%. Further relaxing the energy resolution enables
VOR to gain an extra order of magnitude in flux. In addition, VOR has been
optimised for repetition rate multiplication (RRM) and is therefore able to
measure, in a single ESS period, 6 - 14 incident wavelengths, across a
wavelength band of 9 \AA{} with a novel chopper configuration that transmits
all incident wavelengths with equivalent counting statistics. The
characteristics of VOR make it a unique instrument with capabilities to access
small, limited-lifetime samples and transient phenomena with inelastic neutron

However constructing such a bias is not simple. Here we introduce a functional
of the bias potential and an associated variational principle. The bias that
minimizes the functional relates in a simple way to the free energy surface.
This variational principle can be turned into a practical, efficient and
flexible sampling method. A number of numerical examples are presented which
include the determination of a three dimensional free energy surface. We argue
that, beside being numerically advantageous, our variational approach provides
a convenient standpoint for looking with novel eyes at the sampling problem.

star formation history and chemical evolution of a galaxy. Sulphur, being
moderately volatile, can be reliably measured in the interstellar medium (ISM)
of damped Ly-alpha galaxies and extragalactic HII regions. Measurements in
stars of different metallicity in our Galaxy can then be readily compared to
the abundances in external galaxies. Such a comparison is not possible for Si
or Ca that suffer depletion onto dust in the ISM. Furthermore, studying sulphur
is interesting because it probes nucleosynthetic conditions that are very
different from those of O or Mg. The measurements in star clusters are a
reliable tracers of the Galactic evolution of sulphur. We find
<A(S)>NLTE=6.11+/-0.04 for M 4, <A(S)>NLTE=7.17+/-0.02 for NGC 2477, and
<A(S)>NLTE=7.13+/-0.06 for NGC 5822. For the only star studied in Trumpler 5 we
find A(S)NLTE=6.43+/-0.03 and A(S)LTE=6.94+/-0.05. Our measurements show that,
by and large, the S abundances in Galactic clusters trace reliably those in
field stars. The only possible exception is Trumpler 5, for which the NLTE
sulphur abundance implies an [S/Fe] ratio lower by roughly 0.4 dex than
observed in field stars of comparable metallicity, even though its LTE sulphur
abundance is in line with abundances of field stars. Moreover the LTE sulphur
abundance is consistent only with the abundance of another alpha-element, Mg,
in the same star, while the low NLTE value is consistent with Si and Ca. The S

respective metal surface. Upon increasing the coverage, however, the
orientation of the molecules in the thin films depends on the growth
conditions. Multilayers deposited at low temperatures (LT) exhibit a similar
average tilting angle (30 degree relative to the surface plane) on both
substrates. Conversely, for multilayers grown at room temperature a markedly
different scenario exists. On Cu(111) the film thickness is self-limited to a
coverage of approximately two layers, while on Ag(111) multilayers can be grown
easily and, in contrast to the bulk 2H-P crystal, the molecules are oriented
perpendicular to the surface. This difference in molecular orientation results
in a modified line-shape of the C 1s XPS signatures that is dependent on the
incident photon energy, which is explained by comparison with depth-resolved
DFT calculations. Simulations of ionization energies for differently stacked
molecules show no indication for a packing-induced modification of the
multilayer XP spectra, thus indicating that the comparison of single molecule
calculations to multilayer data is justified.

investigated using a 2.5 dimensional hybrid code simulation. In astrophysical
disks, magnetorotational instability (MRI) is considered to play an important
role by generating turbulence in the disk and contributes to an effective
angular momentum transport through a turbulent viscosity. Magnetic
reconnection, on the other hand, also plays an important role on the evolution
of the disk through a dissipation of a magnetic field enhanced by a dynamo
effect of MRI. In this study, we developed a hybrid code to calculate an
evolution of a differentially rotating system. With this code, we first
confirmed a linear growth of MRI. We also investigated a behavior of a
particular structure of a current sheet, which would exist in the turbulence in
the disk. From the calculation of the magnetic reconnection, we found an
asymmetric structure in the out-of-plane magnetic field during the evolution of
reconnection, which can be understood by a coupling of the Hall effect and the
differential rotation. We also found a migration of X-point whose direction is
determined only by an initial sign of J_0 \times \Omega_0, where J_0 is the
initial current density in the neutral sheet and \Omega_0 is the rotational
vector of the background Keplerian rotation. Associated with the migration of
X-point, we also found a significant enhancement of the perpendicular magnetic
field compared to an ordinary MRI. MRI-Magnetic reconnection coupling and the
resulting magnetic field enhancement can be an effective process to sustain a
strong turbulence in the accretion disk and to a transport of angular momentum.

results from the work distribution part, we next obtain the distribution of the
dissipated heat for the equilibrium initial condition. Using the method of
steepest descent, we obtain a Gaussian distribution for small fluctuations in
the large time limit. The distribution function, for a fixed time has been
obtained numerically. It is shown that the heat distribution, in general, does
not satisfy the transient fluctuation theorem.

Recall that $B$ is a non-degenerate algebra, sitting nicely in the multiplier
algebra $M(A)$ of $A$ so that also $M(B)$ can be viewed as a subalgebra of
$M(A)$. Assume that $u,v$ are invertible elements in $M(B)$ so that
$E(vu\otimes 1)E=E$. This last condition is obviously fulfilled if $u$ and $v$
are each other inverses, but there are also other cases. Now modify $\Delta$
and define $\Delta'(a)=(u\otimes 1)\Delta(a)(v\otimes 1)$ for all $a \in A$. We
show in this paper that $(A,\Delta')$ is again a regular weak multiplier Hopf
algebra and we obtain formulas for the various data of $(A,\Delta')$ in terms
of the data associated with the original pair $(A,\Delta)$. In the case of a
finite-dimensional weak Hopf algebra, the above deformation is a special case
of the twists as studied by Nikshych and Vainerman. It is known that any
regular weak multiplier Hopf algebra gives rise in a natural way to a regular
multiplier Hopf algebroid. This result applies to both the original weak
multiplier Hopf algebra $(A,\Delta)$ and the modified version $(A,\Delta')$.
However, the same method can be used to associate another regular multiplier
Hopf algebroid to the triple $(A,\Delta,\Delta')$. This turns out to give an
example of a regular multiplier Hopf algebroid that does not arise from a
regular weak multiplier Hopf algebra although the base algebra is separable

Deterministic pension models often rely on projections that are based on
several assumptions concerning the ""average"" long-time behavior of the stock
market. Our aim here is to examine some of the popular ""average"" assumptions in
a more realistic setting of a stochastic model. Thus, we examine the contention
that investment in the stock market is similar to gambling in a casino, while
purchasing companies, after due diligence, is safer under the premise that
acting as a holding company that wholly owns other companies avoids some of the
stock market risks. We show that the stock market index faithfully reflects its
companies' profits at the time of their publication. We compare the shifted
historical dynamics of the S\&P500's aggregated financial earnings to its
value, and find a high degree of correlation. We conclude that there is no
benefit to a pension fund in wholly owning a super trust. We verify, by
examining historical data, that stock earnings follow an exponential
(geometric) Brownian motion and estimate its parameters. The robustness of this
model is examined by an estimate of a pensioner's accumulated assets over a
saving period. We also estimate the survival probability and mean survival time
of the accumulated individual fund with pension consumption over the residual
life of the pensioner.

is famously equivalent to that of computing marginal Boltzmann probabilities
for an Ising-like model with multispin interactions in a non-uniform magnetic

well approximated by a generalized mean-field (Bethe-Peierls) approximation.
Belief propagation (BP) and similar iterative algorithms are an efficient way
to perform the calculation, but they sometimes fail to converge, or converge to
non-codewords, giving rise to a non-negligible residual error probability
(error floor). On the other hand, provably-convergent algorithms are far too
complex to be implemented in a real decoder. In this work we consider the
application of the probability-damping technique, which can be regarded either
as a variant of BP, from which it retains the property of low complexity, or as
an approximation of a provably-convergent algorithm, from which it is expected
to inherit better convergence properties. We investigate the algorithm
behaviour on a real instance of Gallager code, and compare the results with

However, the use of linear space is impractical in many applications. In this

the first smooth deterministic time-space trade-off from constant to linear

$\tau$-additive approximation to the LCS in $O(n^2/\tau)$ time and $O(1)$

branching programs, which implies that any deterministic RAM algorithm solving

multiple external interferers, for modeling challenging conditions in

augmented subcarrier processing, which processes each subcarrier jointly with
its counterpart at the image subcarrier, and jointly across RX antennas.
Furthermore, we derive an augmented LMMSE RX. The novel approach integrates the
I/Q imbalance mitigation, interference suppression and data stream separation
into a single processing stage, thus avoiding a separate transceiver
calibration. Our numerical results show the signal-to-interference-plus-noise
ratio and symbol-error rate of an arbitrary data stream after RX processing as
a function of different system parameters. The per-subcarrier processing is
shown to suffer heavily under I/Q imbalances, and being particularly sensitive
to external interferers, whereas the augmented method provides efficient data
stream separation and interference suppression. Finally, we extend the studies

instrumental polarisation in 610 MHz observations by subtracting the expected
response from the $uv$-data itself. Furthermore, a new technique for
polarisation angle calibration is presented that allows for calibration using
an unpolarised source and therefore can be implemented at arbitrarily low

the polarisation angle independently of ionospheric Faraday rotation and source
variability. It also removes the need for known polarised sources on the sky -
which are scarce at low frequencies. We use the technique to retrieve the

consideration of index guiding with an arbitrary profile. Because their domain
of definition is infinite, the convergence properties of the Chebyshev Rational

the previously studied Fourier method. As practical examples, we solve the beam
propagation problem with and without index guiding: we obtain excellent results

of water on the surface of dust grains. Following up on this detection, we
present a search for HOOH in a diverse sample of sources in different

we rediscuss the detection of HOOH in Oph A, as well as the implications of the
low abundance of HOOH, and its similarity with the case of O$_2$. Our chemical
models show that the production of HOOH is extremely sensitive to the

the starting values of the orbital elements derived from the positional
observations. In addition, when drawing conclusions about the origin of these
objects, it is crucial to control the uncertainties of orbital elements at each
stage of the dynamical evolution.
  Aims. I apply a completely homogeneous approach to determine the cometary
orbits and their uncertainties. The resulting catalogue is suitable for the
investigation of the origin and future of near-parabolic comets.
  Methods. First, osculating orbits were determined on the basis of positional
data. Second, the dynamical calculations were performed backwards and forwards
up to 250 au from the Sun to derive original and future barycentric orbits for
each comet. In the present investigation of dynamical evolution, the numerical
calculations for a given object start from the swarm of virtual comets
constructed using the previously determined osculating (nominal) orbit. In this
way, the uncertainties of orbital elements were derived at the end of numerical
calculations.
  Results. Homogeneous sets of orbital elements for osculating, original and
future orbits are given. The catalogue of 119 cometary orbits constitutes about
70 per cent of all the first class so-called Oort spike comets discovered
during the period of 1801-2010 and about 90 per cent of those discovered in
1951-2010, for which observations were completed at the end of 2013.
Non-gravitational (NG) orbits are derived for 45 comets, including asymmetric

occurs in the phase transition phase between the quark gluon plasma (QGP) and
the hadron resonance gas (HRG). Their abundance is believed to appear near the
Hagedorn temperature $T_H$ which in our understanding equals the critical
temperature $T_c$. These hadron-like resonances are characterized by being very
massive and by not being limited to quantum numbers of known hadrons. To
generate a whole zoo of such new states we solve the covariantly formulated
bootstrap equation by regarding energy conservation and conservation of the
baryon number $B$, strangeness $S$ and electric charge $Q$. To investigate
their decay properties decay chain calculations of HS were conducted. One
single (heavy) HS with certain quantum numbers decays by various two-body decay
channels subsequently into final stable hadrons. Multiplicities of these stable
hadrons, their ratios and their energy distributions are presented. Strikingly
the final energy spectra of resulting hadrons show a thermal-like distribution

shape of a M\""obius band. Starting from the solution for a square cross-section
(isotropic), they employ numerical continuation in the cross-sectional aspect
ratio in order to approach the solution for a thin strip. Certain smoothly
varying configurations are obtained. More recently in 2007, Starostin and van
der Heijden pointed out that an actual M\""obius band ""localizes"" into a nearly
flat triangular configuration as the ratio of the strip width to center-line
circumference is no longer small. Accordingly they return to the developable,
thin-plate model of Sadowsky and Wunderlich, obtaining such localized shapes.
In this work we strike a middle ground between these two approaches. We employ
the standard two-director (special) Cosserat model, and we also use the
cross-sectional aspect ratio as a numerical continuation parameter.
Nonetheless, we are able to capture both the smoothly varying shapes and the
localized, nearly triangular configurations. Our point of departure is that we
do not always employ the strength-of-materials formula for the torsional
stiffness - a standard feature of the Kirchhoff theory. Our key observation
comes from the usual Cosserat ansatz in light of developability, suggesting an
increasing torsional stiffness ratio (as well as one increasing bending
stiffness ratio) as the thickness becomes small. We demonstrate that the
closed-loop configurations we obtain are stable with respect to small
perturbations.

using such lattices was limited by very shallow dressed lattices and strong
Landau-Zener tunnelling loss between adiabatic potentials, equivalent to
failure of the adiabatic criterion. In this work we operate with significantly
stronger rf coupling (increasing the avoided-crossing gap between adiabatic
potentials), observing dressed lifetimes of interest for optical lattice-based

chargino decays to the LSP by emitting a $W$ boson. A wide range of scenarios
with different mass splittings between the stop, the lightest neutralino and
the lightest chargino are considered, including cases where the $W$ bosons or
the top quarks are off-shell. Decay modes involving the heavier charginos and
neutralinos are addressed using a set of phenomenological models of
supersymmetry. No significant excess over the Standard Model prediction is
observed. A stop with a mass between $210$ and $640$ GeV decaying directly to a
top quark and a massless LSP is excluded at $95$ % confidence level, and in

are excluded at $95$ % confidence level up to a mass of $500$ GeV for an LSP
mass in the range of $100$ to $150$ GeV. Stringent exclusion limits are also
derived for all other stop decay modes considered, and model-independent upper
limits are set on the visible cross-section for processes beyond the Standard

cone of sums of squares of linear forms. We examine the dimensions of the faces
$P(\Gamma)$ and $\Sigma(\Gamma)$ consisting of forms in $P$ and $\Sigma$, which
vanish on $\Gamma$. As the cardinality of the set $\Gamma$ varies in
$1,\dots,\rm{codim}(X)$, the difference between the dimensions of $P(\Gamma)$
and $\Sigma(\Gamma)$ defines a numerical invariant of $X$, which we call the
gap vector of X. In this article we begin a systematic study of its fundamental
properties. Our main result is a formula relating the components of the gap
vector of $X$ and the quadratic deficiencies of $X$ and its generic
projections. The quadratic deficiency is a fundamental numerical invariant of
projective varieties introduced by F. L. Zak. The relationship between
quadratic deficiency and gap vectors allows us to effectively compute the gap
vectors of concrete varieties as well as to prove several general properties.
We prove that gap vectors are weakly increasing, obtain upper bounds for their
rate of growth and prove that these upper bounds are eventually achieved for
all varieties. Moreover, we give a characterization of the varieties with the
simplest gap vectors: We prove that the gap vector vanishes identically
precisely for varieties of minimal degree, and characterize the varieties whose
gap vector equals $(0,\dots, 0,1)$. In particular, our results give a new proof
of the theorem of Blekherman, Smith and Velasco saying that there are
nonnegative quadratic forms which are not sums of squares on every variety,
which is not of minimal degree. Finally, we determine the gap vector of all

drop of the cross-section for the string ball production can be one to two
orders of magnitude with the increase of the width of the brane from $L=0$ to
15 $\text{TeV}^{-1}$. The cross-section for string ball production in

Black holes are quite hard to be observed at the LHC. In fact, taking into
account the current experimental limits on the fundamental Planck scale, black
holes cannot be produced at the LHC. Cross-section for string ball production
depends significantly on string coupling constant, making it very model
dependent. We investigate the range of values of string coupling constant from
0.02 to 0.4. There has been no evidence for production of string balls at

planet searches. High-precision astrometry is one way to efficiently discover
planets around these objects. We are conducting a planet search survey of 20
M8-L2 using ground-based imaging astrometry with FORS2 at VLT. The realised
accuracy of 100 micro-arcseconds allows us to set stringent constraints on the
presence of planets, to discover astrometric binaries, and to measure
parallaxes with an unprecedented precision of 0.1 %. The obtained detection
limits firmly establish that giant planets are rare around UCDs at all
separations. The astrometric performance of our programme is comparable to what
is expected from Gaia observations of single faint objects and we discuss
potential synergies for planet searches around ultracool dwarfs. We estimate
that Gaia will be able to characterise ~100 astrometric binaries with an
ultracool primary.

the nature of the data, intrinsic properties of the objects, etc. One common
approach is to compare the observational data with theoretical models passed
through some simulator that will leave in the synthetic data the same imprint
than the observational data carries, and see what set of parameters reproduce
the observations best. Even in this case, depending on the kind of data the
astronomer has, the methodology changes slightly. After parameters are
published, the community tend to quote, praise and criticize them, sometimes
paying little attention on whether the possible discrepancies come from the
theoretical models, the data themselves or just the methodology used in the
analysis. In this work we perform the simple, yet interesting, exercise of
comparing the effective temperatures obtained via SED and more detailed
spectral fittings (to the same grid of models), of a sample of well known and
characterized young M-type objects members to different star forming regions

from the difference in methodology/data used. On the other hand we show how
these differences are smaller for colder objects even when the complexity of
the fit increases like for example introducing differential extinction. To
perform this exercise we benefit greatly from the framework offered by the

systems with high photovoltaic (PV) generation have focused on the possibility
of inverters providing ancillary services such as active power curtailment and
reactive power compensation. Major benefits include the possibility of averting
overvoltages, which may otherwise be experienced when PV generation exceeds the
demand. This paper deals with ancillary service procurement in the face of
solar irradiance forecasting errors. In particular, assuming that the
forecasted PV irradiance can be described by a random variable with known
(empirical) distribution, the proposed uncertainty-aware optimal inverter
dispatch (OID) framework indicates which inverters should provide ancillary
services with a guaranteed a-priori risk level of PV generation surplus. To
capture forecasting errors, and strike a balance between risk of overvoltages
and (re)active power reserves, the concept of conditional value-at-risk is
advocated. Due to AC power balance equations and binary inverter selection
variables, the formulated OID involves the solution of a nonconvex
mixed-integer nonlinear program. However, a computationally-affordable convex
relaxation is derived by leveraging sparsity-promoting regularization
approaches and semidefinite relaxation techniques. The proposed scheme is
tested using real-world PV-generation and load-profile data for an illustrative
low-voltage residential distribution system.

of direct pair production of top squarks and presented in terms of exclusion
limits in the ($m_{\tilde{t}_1}$, $m_{\tilde{\chi}_{1}^{0}}$) parameter space.
A top squark of mass up to about 240 GeV is excluded at 95$\%$ confidence level
for arbitrary neutralino masses, within the kinematic boundaries. Top squark
masses up to 270 GeV are excluded for a neutralino mass of 200 GeV. In a
scenario where the top squark and the lightest neutralino are nearly degenerate
in mass, top squark masses up to 260 GeV are excluded. The results from the
monojet-like analysis are also interpreted in terms of compressed scenarios for
top squark pair production in the decay channel $\tilde{t}_1 \to b + ff^{'} +
\tilde{\chi}^{0}_{1}$ and sbottom pair production with $\tilde{b}_1 \to b +
\tilde{\chi}^{0}_{1}$, leading to a similar exclusion for nearly
mass-degenerate third-generation squarks and the lightest neutralino. The
results in this paper significantly extend previous results at colliders.

can determine the popularity of candidates by running sentiment analysis. We
can also uncover candidates popularities in the US states by running the
sentiment analysis algorithm on geo-tagged tweets. To the best of our
knowledge, no previous work in the field has presented a systematic analysis of
a considerable number of tweets employing a combination of analysis techniques

computation-intensive problems by harnessing the power of a vast number of
interconnected computers. For the problem of using network supercomputing to
perform a large collection of independent tasks, prior work introduced a
decentralized approach and provided randomized synchronous algorithms that
perform all tasks correctly with high probability, while dealing with
misbehaving or crash-prone processors. The main weaknesses of existing
algorithms is that they assume either that the \emph{average} probability of a
non-crashed processor returning incorrect results is inferior to $\frac{1}{2}$,
or that the probability of returning incorrect results is known to \emph{each}
processor. Here we present a randomized synchronous distributed algorithm that
tightly estimates the probability of each processor returning correct results.
Starting with the set $P$ of $n$ processors, let $F$ be the set of processors
that crash. Our algorithm estimates the probability $p_i$ of returning a
correct result for each processor $i \in P-F$, making the estimates available
to all these processors. The estimation is based on the $(\epsilon,
\delta)$-approximation, where each estimated probability $\tilde{p_i}$ of $p_i$
obeys the bound ${\sf Pr}[p_i(1-\epsilon) \leq \tilde{p_i} \leq
p_i(1+\epsilon)] > 1 - \delta$, for any constants $\delta >0$ and $\epsilon >0$
chosen by the user. An important aspect of this algorithm is that each
processor terminates without global coordination. We assess the efficiency of
the algorithm in three adversarial models as follows. For the model where the
number of non-crashed processors $|P-F|$ is linearly bounded the time
complexity $T(n)$ of the algorithm is $\Theta(\log{n})$, work complexity $W(n)$
is $\Theta(n\log{n})$, and message complexity $M(n)$ is $\Theta(n\log^2n)$.

second order dynamics. The communication among members of the group is assumed
to be directed and affected by two rationally independent time delays, one in
the position and the other in the velocity information channels. These delays
are unknown but considered to be constant and uniform throughout the system.
The stability of the consensus protocol is studied using a simplifying
factorization procedure and deploying the Cluster Treatment of Characteristic
Roots (CTCR) paradigm. This effort results in a unique depiction of the exact
stability boundaries in the domain of the delays. CTCR requires the knowledge
of the potential stability switching loci exhaustively within this domain. The
creation of these loci is an important contribution of this work. It is done in
a new surrogate coordinate system, called the \emph{Spectral Delay Space
(SDS)}. The relative stability, i.e., the speed to reach consensus of the
system is also investigated for this class of systems. Based on the outcome of
this effort, a paradoxical control design concept is introduced. It is called
the \emph{Delay Scheduling}, which is another key contribution of this paper.
It reveals that the performance of the system may be improved by increasing the
delays. The amount of increase, however, is only revealed by the CTCR. Example
case studies are presented to verify the underlying analytical derivations.

spacetime. There are various propositions on the table, as the grand unified
theory, quantum gravity, supersymmetry, string and superstring theories, and M
theory. However, none of these propositions is able to consistently explain
what matter is and how matter interacts by describing at the same time
electromagnetism, relativity, gravitation, quantum physics and observed
elementary particles. Here it is proposed that spacetime is an isotropic
Newtonian 3D lattice, and that its topological defects, namely diverse
dislocations and disclination loops, are the fundamental building blocks of
ordinary matter. We find, for an isotropic lattice obeying Newton laws and with
specific assumptions on its elastic properties, that the macroscopic behaviour
of this lattice and of its topological defects displays all known physics,
unifying electromagnetism, relativity, gravitation and quantum physics, and
resolving some longstanding questions of modern cosmology. Moreover, studying
various possible microscopic structures of the Newton's lattice, for example
assuming lattice axial symmetry, represented by a colored cubic 3D lattice, we
show that one can possibly identify a lattice structure whose topological
defect loops coincide with the complex zoology of elementary particles, opening
a promising field of research.

Yang-Mills theory with the critical temperature for the

$T_0\sim 2.725\,$K (SU(2)$_{\tiny{CMB}}$), we investigate how CMB temperature
$T$ connects with the cosmological scale factor $a$ in a
Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker Universe. Owing to a violation of
conformal scaling at late times, the tension between the (instantaneous)
redshift of reionisation from CMB observation ($z_{\tiny{re}}\sim 11$) and
quasar spectra ($z_{\tiny{re}}\sim 6$) is repealed. Also, we find that the
redshift of CMB decoupling moves from $z_{\tiny{dec}}\sim 1100$ to
$z_{\tiny{dec}}\sim 1775$ which questions $\Lambda$CDM cosmology at high
redshifts. Adapting this model to the conventional physics of three flavours of
massless cosmic neutrinos, we demonstrate inconsistency with the value
N$_{\tiny{eff}}\sim 3.36$ extracted from Planck data. Interactions between
cosmic neutrinos and the CMB implies a {\sl common} temperature $T$ of (no
longer separately conserved) CMB and neutrino fluids. N$_{\tiny{eff}}\sim 3.36$
then entails a universal, temperature induced cosmic neutrino mass $m_\nu=\xi
T$ with $\xi=3.973$. Our above results on $z_{\tiny{re}}$ and $z_{\tiny{dec}}$,
derived from SU(2)$_{\tiny{CMB}}$ alone, are essentially unaffected when
including such a neutrino sector.

thick regime in simulations of primordial star formation. Our new approach is
based on the TreeCol algorithm, which projects matter distributions onto a
spherical grid to create maps of column densities for each fluid element in the
computational domain. We have improved this algorithm by using the relative gas
velocities, to weight the individual matter contributions with the relative
spectral line overlaps, in order to properly account for the Doppler effect. We
compare our new method to the widely used Sobolev approximation, which yields
an estimate for the column density based on the local velocity gradient and the
thermal velocity. This approach generally underestimates the photon escape
probability, because it neglects the density gradient and the actual shape of
the cloud. We present a correction factor for the true line overlap in the
Sobolev approximation and a new method based on local quantities, which fits
the exact results reasonably well during the collapse of the cloud, with the
error in the cooling rates always being less than 10%. Analytical fitting
formulae fail at determining the photon escape probability after formation of
the first protostar (error of 40%) because they are based on the assumption of
spherical symmetry and therefore break down once a protostellar accretion disc
has formed. Our method yields lower temperatures and hence promotes
fragmentation for densities above 10^{10}/ccm at a distance of 200AU from the
first protostar. Since the overall accretion rates are hardly affected by the
cooling implementation, we expect Pop III stars to have lower masses in our
simulations, compared to the results of previous simulations that used the
Sobolev approximation.

the absolute stable phase from the metastable phase. This emergent quantity is
independent of the density of the traffic lane, and determines an intrinsic
scale that characterizes the dynamics of localized quasisoliton structures
given by the time derivative of the headways. The intrinsic scale is analogous
to the ""charge"" of quasisolitons that controls the strength of interaction
between multiple clusters, leading to non-trivial cluster statistics from
random perturbations to initial uniform traffic. The cluster statistics depend
both on the charge and the density of the traffic lane; the relationship is
qualitatively universal for general car-following models.
