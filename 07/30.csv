CO(3-2), 13CO(2-1) and C18O(2-1) line emission of a faint object, SMM2E, near
the driving source of the HH797 outflow in the IC348 cluster. The continuum
emission shows an unresolved source for which we estimate a mass of gas and
dust of 30 Mjup, and the CO(3-2) line reveals a compact bipolar outflow centred
on SMM2E, and barely seen also in 13CO(2-1). In addition, C18O(2-1) emission
reveals hints of a possible rotating envelope/disk perpendicular to the
outflow, for which we infer a dynamical mass of ~16 Mjup. In order to further
constrain the accreted mass of the object, we gathered data from Spitzer,
Herschel, and new and archive submillimetre observations, and built the
Spectral Energy Distribution (SED). The SED can be fitted with one single
modified black-body from 70 micron down to 2.1 cm, using a dust temperature of
~24 K, a dust emissivity index of 0.8, and an envelope mass of ~35 Mjup. The
bolometric luminosity is 0.10 Lsun, and the bolometric temperature is 35 K.
Thus, SMM2E is comparable to the known Class 0 objects in the stellar domain.
An estimate of the final mass indicates that SMM2E will most likely remain
substellar, and the SMM2E outflow force matches the trend with luminosity known
for young stellar objects. Thus, SMM2E constitutes an excellent example of a
Class 0 proto-brown dwarf candidate which forms as a scaled-down version of
low-mass stars. Finally, SMM2E seems to be part of a wide (~2400 AU) multiple
system of Class 0 sources.

radio continuum sources in the vicinity of the Perseus molecular cloud. Strong
absorption lines were detected in all cases allowing us to estimate spin
temperature (T_s) and optical depth for 107 individual Gaussian components
along these lines of sight. Basic properties of individual HI clouds (spin
temperature, optical depth, and the column density of the cold and warm neutral
medium, CNM and WNM) in and around Perseus are very similar to those found for
random interstellar lines of sight sampled by the Millennium HI survey. This
suggests that the neutral gas found in and around molecular clouds is not
atypical. However, lines of sight in the vicinity of Perseus have on average a
higher total HI column density and the CNM fraction, suggesting an enhanced
amount of cold HI relative to an average interstellar field. Our estimated
optical depth and spin temperature are in stark contrast with the recent
attempt at using Planck data to estimate properties of the optically thick HI.
Only ~15% of lines of sight in our study have a column density weighted average
spin temperature lower than 50 K, in comparison with >85% of Planck's sky
coverage. The observed CNM fraction is inversely proportional to the
optical-depth weighted average spin temperature, in excellent agreement with
the recent numerical simulations by Kim et al. While the CNM fraction is on
average higher around Perseus relative to a random interstellar field, it is
generally low, 10-50%. This suggests that extended WNM envelopes around
molecular clouds, and/or significant mixing of CNM and WNM throughout molecular
clouds, are present and should be considered in the models of molecule and star

renders the super-ionic and reticulating phases accessible to relatively low
mass planets lacking a H/He atmosphere. We model the thermal and structural
profile of the planetary crust and discuss five possible crustal regimes. The
formation of methane clathrate in the subsurface is shown to inhibit the
formation of a subterranean ocean. This effect results in increased stresses on
the lithosphere making modes of ice plate tectonics possible. The dynamics of

  Networks Powered by Hybrid Energy Sources",,,,"TR-ANL-2014-05","cs.NI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Dramatic mobile data traffic growth has spurred a dense deployment of small
cell base stations (SCBSs). Small cells enhance the spectrum efficiency and
thus enlarge the capacity of mobile networks. Although SCBSs consume much less
power than macro BSs (MBSs) do, the overall power consumption of a large number
of SCBSs is phenomenal. As the energy harvesting technology advances, base
stations (BSs) can be powered by green energy to alleviate the on-grid power
consumption. For mobile networks with high BS density, traffic load balancing
is critical in order to exploit the capacity of SCBSs. To fully utilize
harvested energy, it is desirable to incorporate the green energy utilization
as a performance metric in traffic load balancing strategies. In this paper, we
have proposed a traffic load balancing framework that strives a balance between
network utilities, e.g., the average traffic delivery latency, and the green
energy utilization. Various properties of the proposed framework have been
derived. Leveraging the software-defined radio access network architecture, the
proposed scheme is implemented as a virtually distributed algorithm, which
significantly reduces the communication overheads between users and BSs. The
simulation results show that the proposed traffic load balancing framework
enables an adjustable trade-off between the on-grid power consumption and the
average traffic delivery latency, and saves a considerable amount of on-grid
power, e.g., 30%, at a cost of only a small increase, e.g., 8%, of the average
traffic delivery latency.

network's MIMO channels are mathematically decomposed into several effective
multiple-input--single-output (MISO) channels, which are essentially spatially
multiplexed for transmission. Hence, these effective MISO channels are referred
to as spatial multiplexing components (SMCs). For the sake of improving the
SE/ESE performance attained, the SMCs are grouped using a pair of proposed
grouping algorithms. The first is optimal in the sense that it exhaustively
evaluates all the possible combinations of SMCs satisfying both the
semi-orthogonality criterion and other relevant system constraints, whereas the
second is a lower-complexity alternative. Corresponding to each of the two
grouping algorithms, the pair of SE and ESE maximization problems are
formulated, thus the optimal SMC groups and optimal power control variables can
be obtained for each subcarrier block. These optimization problems are proven
to be concave, and the dual decomposition approach is employed for obtaining
their solutions. Relying on these optimization solutions, the impact of various
system parameters on both the attainable SE and ESE is characterized. In

surface with diffusion constant $D_{\rm B}$, and can exchange with any A atom
of the substrate at constant rate. There is no exchange back, and emerging
atoms diffuse on the surface with diffusion constant $D_{\rm A}$. When any two
diffusing atoms meet, they nucleate a point island. The islands neither diffuse
nor break, and grow by capturing other diffusing atoms. The model leads to an
island density governed by the diffusion of one of the species at low

preserves certain characteristics of data. In this work we focus on data coming
from a mixture of Gaussian distributions and we propose a method that preserves
distinctness of clustering structure, although the structure is assumed to be
yet unknown. The rationale behind the method is the following: (i) had one
known the clusters (classes) within the data, one could facilitate further
analysis and reduce space dimension by projecting the data to the Fisher's
linear subspace, which -- by definition -- preserves the structure of the given
classes best (ii) under some reasonable assumptions, this can be done, albeit
approximately, without the prior knowledge of the clusters (classes). In the
paper, we show how this approach works. We present a method of preliminary data
transformation that brings the directions of largest overall variability close
to the directions of the best between-class separation. Hence, for the
transformed data, simple PCA provides an approximation to the Fisher's
subspace. We show that the transformation preserves distinctness of unknown
structure in the data to a great extent.

applies in particular to the generalised Chaplygin gas, which was shown to be
equivalent to interacting models at both background and perturbation levels. In
the present paper we test the non-adiabatic Chaplygin gas against the Hubble
diagram of type Ia supernovae, the position of the first acoustic peak in the
anisotropy spectrum of the cosmic microwave background and the linear power
spectrum of large scale structures. We consider two different samples of SNe
Ia, namely the Constitution and SDSS compilations, both calibrated with the
MLCS2k2 fitter, and for the power spectrum we use the 2dFGRS catalogue. The
model parameters to be adjusted are the present Hubble parameter, the present
matter density and the Chaplygin gas parameter $\alpha$. The joint analysis
best fit gives $\alpha \approx - 0.5$, which corresponds to a constant-rate
energy flux from dark energy to dark matter, with the dark energy density
decaying linearly with the Hubble parameter. The $\Lambda$CDM model, equivalent
to $\alpha = 0$, stands outside the $3\sigma$ confidence interval. This result
is still valid if we use, as supernovae samples, the SDSS and Union2.1

follow a increasing exponential function. This property of a Yule tree can
serve as a simple test for empirical data to be well described by a Yule

separated by a certain time distance. To make our results more useful for
realistic scenarios, we explicitly take into account that the leaves of a tree

indirect detection of dark matter (DM) from annihilation and/or decay products.
Empirical estimates of their DM content - and hence the magnitudes of expected
signals - rely on inferences from stellar-kinematic data. However, various
kinematic analyses can give different results and it is not obvious which are
most reliable. Using extensive sets of mock data of various sizes (mimicking
'ultra-faint' and 'classical' dSphs) and an MCMC engine, here we investigate
biases, uncertainties, and limitations of analyses based on parametric
solutions to the spherical Jeans equation. For a variety of functional forms
for the tracer and DM density profiles, as well as the orbital anisotropy
profile, we examine reliability of estimates for the astrophysical J- and
D-factors for annihilation and decay, respectively. For large (N > 1000)
stellar-kinematic samples typical of 'classical' dSphs, errors tend to be
dominated by systematics, which can be reduced through the use of sufficiently
general and flexible functional forms. For small (N < 100) samples typical of
'ultrafaints', statistical uncertainties tend to dominate systematic errors and
flexible models are less necessary. We define an optimal strategy that would
mitigate sensitivity to priors and other aspects of analyses based on the
spherical Jeans equation. We also find that the assumption of spherical
symmetry can bias estimates of J (with the 95% credibility intervals not
encompassing the true J-factor) when the object is mildly triaxial (axis ratios
b/a = 0.8, c/a = 0.6). A concluding table summarises the typical error budget
and biases for the different sample sizes considered.

extending the lumped-element derivation to include transmission line filters,
this is achieved by the introduction of a novel method wherein the left- and

two-port sub-network. Specific examples of the sub-network are given which
increase the stop-band attenuation per filter cell and steepen the cutoff
response without disrupting the reflectionless property or increasing the
insertion-loss in the pass-band. It is noteworthy that a common feature of all
the structures derived by these methods is that most, if not all, of the
reactive elements are of equal normalized value. This greatly simplifies the
tuning requirements, and has facilitated their implementation as monolithic
microwave integrated circuits (MMICs). A number of examples of MMIC
reflectionless filters constructed in this way are presented and their results

enabled by far-ultraviolet spectroscopy of a low-mass (~0.19 Msun) white dwarf
(WD), GALEX J1717+6757, which is in a 5.9-hr binary with a fainter,
more-massive companion. We see absorption from nine metals, including roughly
solar abundances of Ca, Fe, Ti, and P. We detect a significantly sub-solar
abundance of C, and put upper limits on N and O that are also markedly
sub-solar. Updated diffusion calculations indicate that all metals should
settle out of the atmosphere of this 14,900 K, log(g) = 5.67 WD in the absence
of radiative forces in less than 20 yr, orders of magnitude faster than the
cooling age of hundreds of Myr. We demonstrate that ongoing accretion of rocky
material that is often the cause of atmospheric metals in isolated, more
massive WDs is unlikely to explain the observed abundances in GALEX J1717+6757.
Using new radiative levitation calculations, we determine that radiative forces
can counteract diffusion and support many but not all of the elements present
in the atmosphere of this WD; radiative levitation cannot, on its own, explain
all of the observed abundance patterns, and additional mechanisms such as
rotational mixing may be required. Finally, we detect both primary and
secondary eclipses using ULTRACAM high-speed photometry, which we use to
constrain the low-mass WD radius and rotation rate as well as update the
ephemeris from the discovery observations of this WD+WD binary.

to predict the location of transitions between antineutrino states which, in
the normal hierarchy we are using, will not undergo Mikheev-Smirnov-Wolfenstein

applied to the turbulence derived found in a 2D supernova simulation and

non-Gaussian metastable distributions, which emerge from the interplay between

passive adversary (without the above capabilities) can observe from the device
communications. Work in this latter direction aimed, for example, at inferring
the apps a user has installed on his device, or identifying the presence of a

  In this paper, we move a step forward: we investigate to which extent it is
feasible to identify the specific actions that a user is doing on his mobile

aim at identifying actions like browsing someone's profile on a social network,
posting a message on a friend's wall, or sending an email. We design a system
that achieves this goal starting from encrypted TCP/IP packets: it works
through identification of network flows and application of machine learning

meet increasing demands for rapidly available energy by switching to purely

cytotoxic cells of the immune system also have increased energy demands and
also switch to pure glycolysis when they are in an activated state. Moreover,
while cancer cells can revert back to aerobic metabolism, rapidly proliferating
cytotoxic lymphocytes are incapable of performing their function when adequate
resources are lacking. Consequently, in the tumor microenvironment there must
exist competition for the common resources between cancer cells and the cells
of the immune system, which may drive a lot of the tumor-immune dynamics.
Proposed here is a model of tumor-immune-glucose interactions, formulated as a
predator-prey-common resource type system, which allows to investigate possible
dynamical behaviors that may arise as a result of competition for glucose,
including tumor elimination, tumor dormancy and unrestrained tumor growth.

As dust forms around stars, stellar transients, quasars or supernovae, the
grains must grow through a regime where they are stochastically heated by
individual photons. Since evaporation rates increase exponentially with
temperature while cooling times decrease only as a power law, the evaporation
rates for these small grains are dominated by the temperature spikes. We
calculate effective evaporation temperatures for a broad range of input spectra
that are encapsulated in a series of simple interpolation formulae for both
graphitic and silicate grains. These can be easily used to first determine if
dust formation is possible and then to estimate the radius or time at which it
commences for a broad range of radiation environments. With these additional
physical effects, very small grains may form earlier than in standard models of
AGB winds. Even for very high mass loss rates, the hottest stars that can form
dust are G and F stars particularly in the case of silicate dusts. For hotter
stars, the higher fluxes of ultraviolet photons prevent dust formation. Thus,
episodic dust formation by OH/IR stars and LBVs is primarily driven by
fluctuations in their apparent temperatures rather than changes in luminosity
or mass loss rates.

matter can enhance gravitational forces on cosmological scales while restoring
general relativity in the Solar neighborhood. In the intermediate regime,
kinematically inferred masses experience an additional radial dependence with
respect to the underlying distribution of matter, which is caused by the
increment of gravitational forces with increasing distance from the Milky Way
center. The same effect can influence the internal kinematics of subhalos and
cause cuspy matter distributions to appear core-like. Specializing to the
chameleon model as a worked example, we demonstrate this effect by tracing the
scalar field from the outskirts of the Milky Way halo to its interior,
simultaneously fitting observed velocity dispersions of chemo-dynamically
discriminated red giant populations in the Fornax and Sculptor dwarf
spheroidals. Whereas in standard gravity these observations suggest that the
matter distribution of the dwarfs is cored, we find that in the presence of a
chameleon field the assumption of a cuspy Navarro-Frenk-White profile becomes
perfectly compatible with the data. Importantly, chameleon models also predict
the existence of slopes between two stellar subcomponents that in Newtonian
gravity would be interpreted as a depletion of matter in the dwarf center.
Hence, an observation of such an apparently pathological scenario may serve as
a smoking gun for the presence of a chameleon field or a similar modification
of gravity, independent of baryonic feedback effects. In general, measuring the
dynamic mass profiles of the Milky Way dwarfs provides stronger constraints
than those inferred from the screening scale of the Solar System since these
are located at greater distances from the halo center.

is the first evidence for active accretion of a free-floating planet. The
object allows us to study accretion and disk physics at the extreme and can be
seen as free-floating analog of accreting planets that orbit stars. Our
analysis of OTS44 shows that the mass-accretion rate decreases continuously
from stars of several solar masses down to free-floating planets. We
determined, furthermore, the disk mass (10 Earth masses) and further disk
properties of OTS44 through modeling its SED including Herschel far-IR data. We

black hole remnants. In this paper, we explore the WGC from the perspective of
low-energy effective field theory. Below the charged particle threshold, the
effective action describes a photon and graviton interacting via
higher-dimension operators. We derive infrared consistency conditions on the
parameters of the effective action using i) analyticity of light-by-light
scattering, ii) unitarity of the dynamics of an arbitrary ultraviolet
completion, and iii) absence of superluminality and causality violation in
certain non-trivial backgrounds. For convenience, we begin our analysis in
three spacetime dimensions, where gravity is non-dynamical but has a physical
effect on photon-photon interactions. We then consider four dimensions, where
propagating gravity substantially complicates all of our arguments, but bounds
can still be derived. Operators in the effective action arise from two types of
diagrams: those that involve electromagnetic interactions (parameterized by a
charge-to-mass ratio $q/m$) and those that do not (parameterized by a
coefficient $\gamma$). Infrared consistency implies that $q/m$ is bounded from

relatively low rates of star formation. The slow recycling of gas and energy
from supernovae in our chemical model has important consequences on the
predicted star formation rates, which are systematically lower than the

boundary conditions in AdS$_3$, we can define a consistent phase space in
warped AdS$_3$ with identical conserved charges. This way, we easily obtain a
Virasoro $\times$ Virasoro asymptotic symmetry algebra in warped AdS$_3$; two
different types of Virasoro $\times$ Ka\v{c}-Moody symmetries are also
consistent alternatives.
  Next, we study the phase space of these theories when propagating modes are
included. We show that, as long as one can define a conserved symplectic form
without introducing instabilities, the Virasoro $\times$ Virasoro asymptotic
symmetries can be extended to the entire (linearized) phase space. This implies
that, at least at semi-classical level, consistent theories of gravity in
warped AdS$_3$ are described by a two-dimensional conformal field theory, as
long as stability is not an issue.

the fundamental plane relations for elliptical galaxies. Halos in less luminous
galaxies have smaller core radii, higher central densities, and smaller central
velocity dispersions. If dwarf spheroidal (dSph) and dwarf Magellanic irregular
(dIm) galaxies lie on the extrapolations of these correlations, then we can
estimate their baryon loss relative to that of brighter Sc-Im galaxies. We find
that, if there had been no such enhanced baryon loss, then typical dSph and dIm
galaxies would be brighter in absolute magnitude by 4 and 3.5 mag,
respectively. Instead, these galaxies lost or retained as gas (in dIm galaxies)
baryons that could have formed stars. Also, typical dSph and dIm galaxies have
DM halos that are more massive than we thought, with velocity dispersions of
about 30 km/s or circular-orbit rotation velocities of V_circ ~ 42 km/s.
Comparison of DM and visible matter correlations confirms that, at V-band
absolute magnitudes fainter than -18, dSph and dIm galaxies form a sequence of
decreasing baryon-to-DM mass ratios in smaller dwarfs. We show explicitly that
galaxy baryon content goes to (almost) zero at halo V_circ = 42 +- 4 km/s, in
agreement with what we found from our estimate of baryon depletion. Our results
suggest that there may be a large population of DM halos that are essentially
dark and undiscovered. This helps to solve the problem that the fluctuation

the partition function in thermodynamics, and the results mapped between

the optimal cost is provided by investigating the steady state of the system
for some specific scenarios. Then, an algorithm to solve the cost minimization
problem using the technique of Lyapunov optimization is developed and results
for the performance of the algorithm are provided. These results show that in
the presence of limited storage devices, the grid can benefit greatly from
cooperation, whereas in the presence of large storage capacity, cooperation
does not yield much benefit. Further, it is observed that most of the gains
from cooperation can be obtained by exchanging energy only among a few energy
harvesting sources.

the use of three stochastic quantifiers: the Kullback-Leibler divergence and
the Jensen-Shannon and Hellinger distances. The sensitivity of these measures
was analyzed with respect to the following perturbations: edge addition, edge
removal, edge rewiring and node removal, all of them applied at different

these perturbations. Additionally, hypotheses tests were performed to verify
the behavior of the degree distribution to identify the intensity of the
perturbations that leads to break this property.

momenta are predicted by some alternative approaches to ""real"" 4D quantum

concerns that a nonlinear law of addition of momenta might inevitably produce a

of momentum composition in the description of spacetime locality. However, the
notion of total momentum of a multi-particle system is not a manifestation of
locality, but rather reflects translational invariance. By working within an

translational invariance still results in an undeformed linear law of addition

driven lattice gases under global weak exchange, I show here that it does not
predict the coexisting densities in athermal stochastic lattice gases under a
nonuniform drive. I consider the lattice gas with nearest-neighbor exclusion on
the square lattice, with nearest-neighbor hopping (NNE dynamics), and with
hopping to both nearest and next-nearest neighbors (NNE2 dynamics). Part of the
system is subject to a drive $D$ that favors hopping along one direction, while
the other part is free of the drive. Thus the steady state represents
coexistence between two subsystems, one far from equilibrium and the other in
equilibrium, which exchange particles along the interfaces. The dimensionless
chemical potential $\mu^*(\rho,D) = \mu/k_B T$ for the lattice gas with density
$\rho$ is readily determined in studies of a uniform system. Under the
nonuniform drive, however, equating the chemical potentials of the coexisting
subsystems does not yield the coexisting densities. The steady state chemical
potential is, moreover, different in the coexisting bulk regions, contrary to
the basic principles of thermodynamics. These results cast serious doubt on the

allow up to $h$ assemblies to combine in a single assembly step. Despite
substantial consideration, no purely growth self-assembly model has yet been
shown to strictly assemble an infinite fractal without significant modification
to the fractal shape. In this paper we not only achieve this, but in the case
of the Sierpinski carpet are able to achieve it within the 2-HAM, one of the

for deep learning. Reconstructions can be propagated in a form of target
propagation playing a role similar to back-propagation but helping to reduce
the reliance on derivatives in order to perform credit assignment across many
levels of possibly strong non-linearities (which is difficult for
back-propagation). A regularized auto-encoder tends produce a reconstruction
that is a more likely version of its input, i.e., a small move in the direction
of higher likelihood. By generalizing gradients, target propagation may also
allow to train deep networks with discrete hidden units. If the auto-encoder
takes both a representation of input and target (or of any side information) in
input, then its reconstruction of input representation provides a target
towards a representation that is more likely, conditioned on all the side
information. A deep auto-encoder decoding path generalizes gradient propagation
in a learned way that can could thus handle not just infinitesimal changes but
larger, discrete changes, hopefully allowing credit assignment through a long
chain of non-linear operations. In addition to each layer being a good
auto-encoder, the encoder also learns to please the upper layers by
transforming the data into a space where it is easier to model by them,
flattening manifolds and disentangling factors. The motivations and theoretical
justifications for this approach are laid down in this paper, along with
conjectures that will have to be verified either mathematically or
experimentally, including a hypothesis stating that such auto-encoder mediated
target propagation could play in brains the role of credit assignment through
many non-linear, noisy and discrete transformations.

  assisted by less noisy qubits","8 pages, 1 figure",,,,"quant-ph cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Recently a framework for assisted quantum error correction was proposed in
which a specific type of error is allowed to occur on auxiliary qubits, which
is in contrast to standard entanglement assistance that requires noiseless
auxiliary qubits. However, while the framework maintains the ability to import
any binary or quaternary linear code without sacrificing active error
correction power, it requires the code designer to turn a parity-check matrix
of the underlying classical code into an equivalent one in standard form. This
means that classical coding theoretic techniques that require parity-check
matrices to be in specific form may not fully be exploitable. Another issue of
the recently proposed scheme is that the error correction capabilities for bit
errors and phase errors are generally equal, which is not ideal for asymmetric
error models. This paper addresses these two problems. We generalize the
framework in such a way that any parity-check matrix of any binary or
quaternary linear code can be exploited. Our generalization also allows for
importing a pair of distinct linear codes so that error correction capabilities
become suitably asymmetric.

  Recently, we performed magnetic Doppler imaging study of the chemically

with the HARPSpol instrument on the 3.6-m ESO telescope. Our analysis shows
that the magnetic field of HD 24712 has very strong dipolar component with weak

  The finding of dipole-like field for HD 24712 gives evidence for the

plan on performing magnetic Doppler imaging from four Stokes parameter

significant hotspots of dengue transmission near the center of Machala. The
best-fit model to predict the presence of dengue included older age and female
gender of the head of the household, greater access to piped water in the home,
poor housing condition, and less distance to the central hospital. Wavelet
analyses revealed that dengue transmission co-varied with rainfall and minimum

function basis. These rules were extended by Macdonald to his now famous
symmetric function basis. The original form of these rules had a forbidding
complexity that made them difficult to use in explicit calculations. In the
early 90's it was discovered that, due to massive cancellations, the dual rule,
which expresses skewing by $e_1$ the modified Macdonald polynomial ${\tilde
H}_\mu[X;q,t]$, can be given a very simple combinatorial form in terms of
corner weights of the Ferrers' diagram of $\mu$. A similar formula was later
obtained by the last named author for the multiplication of ${\tilde
H}_\mu[X;q,t]$ by $e_1$, but never published. In the years that followed we
have seen some truly remarkable uses of these two Pieri rules in establishing
highly non trivial combinatorial results in the Theory of Macdonald
polynomials. This theory has recently been spectacularly enriched by various
Algebraic Geometrical results in the works of Hikita, Schiffmann,
Schiffmann-Vasserot, A. Negut and Gorsky-Negut. This development opens up the
challenging task of deriving their results by purely Algebraic Combinatorial
methods. In this paper we present the progress obtained by means of Pieri

exponential dichotomy, where the linear evolution operators are defined by
nonautonomous differential equations $\dot x=A(t)x$ in $\R^n$. Using the
nonuniform dichotomy spectrum we obtain the normal forms of the nonautonomous
linear differential equations. Finally we establish the finite jet normal forms
of the nonlinear differential systems $\dot x=A(t)x+f(t,x)$ in $\R^n$, which is
based on the nonuniform dichotomy spectrum and the normal forms of the
nonautonomous linear systems.

forward planning algorithm and we propose a much more efficient variant by
combining backward and forward search. In particular, we propose a Backward
State-space Reduction technique that consists in two phases: first, an Abstract
Planning Graph P is created by using the Abstract Backward Planning Algorithm
(ABP), then the abstract planning graph P is instantiated into a corresponding
planning graph P by using the Forward Plan Instantiation Algorithm (FPI). The
advantage is that in the preliminary ABP phase we produce a symbolic plan that
is a pattern to direct the search of the concrete plan. This can be seen as a
kind of informed search where the preliminary backward phase is useful to
discover properties of the state-space that can be used to direct the
subsequent forward phase. We evaluate the effectiveness of our ABP+FPI

Like shock waves these are routinely used as test-cases for hydrodynamic codes
and are discussed to play an important role in the explosion mechanism of
core-collapse supernovae. As a first test we study the evolution of a
single-mode Rayleigh-Taylor instability at the interface of a light and a heavy
fluid in the presence of a gravitational acceleration. To suppress
small-wavelength instabilities caused by the irregularity in the separation
layer we use a large particle mean free path. The latter leads to the
development of a diffusion layer as particles propagate from one fluid into the
other. For small amplitudes, when the instability is in the linear regime, we
compare its position and shape to the analytic prediction. Despite the
broadening of the fluid interface we see a good agreement with the analytic
solution. At later times we observe the development of a mushroom like shape
caused by secondary Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities as seen in hydrodynamic
simulations and consistent with experimental observations.

photometric period of P$_{0}$ = 0.889521(12) days. A spectroscopic period
search reveals an orbital period for the system of P$_{orb}$ = 1.3654(11) days.
The discrepancy in the two periods and the identification of a second and third
distinct frequency in the photometric fourier transform at P$_1$ = 3.1347(56)
and P$_2$ = 1.517(28) days provides evidence that HD314884 is a slowly
pulsating B star (SPB) with at least three oscillation frequencies. These
frequencies appear to originate from higher-order, non-linear tidal pulsations.
Using the dynamical parameters obtained from the radial velocity curve, we find
the most probable companion mass to be M$_1$ = $\sim$0.8 M$_{\odot}$ assuming a
typical mass for the B star and most probable inclination. We conclude that the
X-ray source companion to HD314884 is most likely a coronally active G-type
star or a white dwarf (WD), with no apparent emission lines in the optical
spectrum. The mass probability distribution of the companion star mass spans
0.6-2.3 M$_{\odot}$ at 99$\%$ confidence which allows the possibility of a
neutron star companion. The X-ray source is unlikely to be a black hole unless
it is of a very low mass or low binary inclination.

world, its active role resulting from the interaction with flow and sediment
processes has only recently become an active field of research. Especially, the
role of vegetation in the process of river pattern formation has been explored
and demonstrated mostly experimentally and numerically until now. In the
present work, we shed light on this subject by performing a linear stability
analysis on a simple model for riverbed vegetation dynamics coupled with the
set of classical river morphodynamic equations. The vegetation model only
accounts for logistic growth, local positive feedback through seeding and
resprouting, and mortality by means of uprooting through flow shear stress. Due
to the simplicity of the model, we can transform the set of equations into an
eigenvalue problem and assess the stability of the linearized equations when
slightly perturbated away from a spatially homogeneous solution. If we couple
vegetation dynamics with a 1D morphodynamic framework, we observe that
instability towards long sediment waves is possible due to competitive
interaction between vegetation growth and mortality. Moreover, the domain in
the parameter space where perturbations are amplified was found to be simply
connected. Subsequently, we proceed to the analysis of vegetation dynamics
coupled with a 2D morphodynamic framework, which can be used to evaluate
instability towards alternate and multiple bars. It is found that two kinds of
instabilities, which are discriminated mainly by the Froude number, occur in a
connected domain in the parameter space. At lower Froude number, instability is
mainly governed by sediment dynamics and leads to the formation of alternate
and multiple bars while at higher Froude number instability is driven by
vegetation dynamics, which only allows for alternate bars.

centrifugal ejection from a critically or near-critically rotating surface

efficient mechanism for transporting the angular momentum outwards. The outer
part of the disk can extend up to a very large distance from the parent star.
We study the evolution of density, radial and azimuthal velocity, and angular
momentum loss rate of equatorial decretion disks out to very distant regions.
We investigate how the physical characteristics of the disk depend on the
distribution of temperature and viscosity. We calculated stationary models
using the Newton-Raphson method. For time-dependent hydrodynamic modeling we
developed the numerical code based on an explicit finite difference scheme on
an Eulerian grid including full Navier-Stokes shear viscosity. The sonic point
distance and the maximum angular momentum loss rate strongly depend on the
temperature profile and are almost independent of viscosity. The rotational
velocity at large radii rapidly drops accordingly to temperature and viscosity
distribution. The total amount of disk mass and the disk angular momentum
increase with decreasing temperature and viscosity. The time-dependent
one-dimensional models basically confirm the results obtained in the stationary
models as well as the assumptions of the analytical approximations. Including
full Navier-Stokes viscosity we systematically avoid the rotational velocity
sign change at large radii. The unphysical drop of the rotational velocity and
angular momentum loss at large radii (present in some models) can be avoided in
the models with decreasing temperature and viscosity.

conjectured [L. Casetti, C. Nardini, and R. Nerattini, Phys. Rev. Lett. 106,

implies that the microcanonical density of states of an O$(n)$ spin model on a
lattice can be effectively approximated in terms of the density of states of an
Ising model defined on the same lattice and with the same interactions. Were
this relation exact, it would imply that the critical energy densities of all
the O$(n)$ models (i.e., the average values per spin of the O$(n)$ Hamiltonians
at their respective critical temperatures) should be equal to that of the
corresponding Ising model; it is therefore worth investigating how different
the critical energies are and how this difference depends on $n$.
  We compare the critical energy densities of O$(n)$ models in three dimensions
in some specific cases: the O$(1)$ or Ising model, the O$(2)$ or $XY$ model,
the O$(3)$ or Heisenberg model, the O$(4)$ model and the O$(\infty)$ or
spherical model, all defined on regular cubic lattices and with ferromagnetic

analysis of data produced by means of Monte Carlo simulations on lattices with

results has been improved. We also derive an interpolation formula showing that
the difference between the critical energy densities of O$(n)$ models and that

auxiliary-field Monte Carlo methods. These methods have allowed applications
ranging from the study of strongly correlated models, such as the Hubbard
model, to ab initio calculations in molecules and solids. The present package
implements the full ground-state constrained-path Monte Carlo (CPMC) method in
Matlab with a graphical interface, using the Hubbard model as an example. The
package can perform calculations in finite supercells in any dimensions, under
periodic or twist boundary conditions. Importance sampling and all other
algorithmic details of a total energy calculation are included and illustrated.
This open-source tool allows users to experiment with various model and run
parameters and visualize the results. It provides a direct and interactive
environment to learn the method and study the code with minimal overhead for
setup. Furthermore, the package can be easily generalized for auxiliary-field
quantum Monte Carlo (AFQMC) calculations in many other models for correlated
electron systems, and can serve as a template for developing a production code
for AFQMC total energy calculations in real materials. Several illustrative
studies are carried out in one- and two-dimensional lattices on total energy,
kinetic energy, potential energy, and charge- and spin-gaps.

by performing scalable stochastic Bayesian optimisation of ML algorithm
parameters and hyper-parameters. More often than not, the critical tuning of ML
algorithm parameters has relied on domain expertise from experts, along with
laborious hand-tuning, brute search or lengthy sampling runs. Against this
background, Bayesian optimisation is finding increasing use in automating
parameter tuning, making ML algorithms accessible even to non-experts. However,
the state of the art in Bayesian optimisation is incapable of scaling to the
large number of evaluations of algorithm performance required to fit realistic
models to complex, big data. We here describe a stochastic, sparse, Bayesian
optimisation strategy to solve this problem, using many thousands of noisy
evaluations of algorithm performance on subsets of data in order to effectively
train algorithms for big data. We provide a comprehensive benchmarking of
possible sparsification strategies for Bayesian optimisation, concluding that a
Nystrom approximation offers the best scaling and performance for real tasks.
Our proposed algorithm demonstrates substantial improvement over the state of
the art in tuning the parameters of a Gaussian Process time series prediction
task on real, big data.

interstitials on the electronic, lattice and magnetic properties of

alloy has a shallow, double-well free energy function that is the basis of
itinerant metamagnetism. On increasing the dopant concentration, the resulting
lattice expansion causes an initial increase in magnetisation for all
interstitials that is only maintained at higher levels of doping in the case of
hydrogen. Strong s-p band hybridisation occurs at high B,C and N
concentrations. We thus find that the electronic effects of hydrogen doping are
much less pronounced than those of other interstitials, and result in the
double-well structure of the free energy function being least sensitive to the
amount of hydrogen. This microscopic picture accounts for the vanishing first
order nature of the transition by B,C, and N dopants as observed
experimentally. We use our calculated electronic density of states for
LaSiFe$_{12}$ and the hydrogenated alloy to infer changes in magneto-elastic
coupling and in phonon entropy on heating through $T_C$ by calculating the
fermionic entropy due to the itinerant electrons. Lastly, we predict the
electron thermopower in a spin-mixing, high temperature limit and compare our

resonance (CALR) in the two and three dimensional quasistatic regimes. CALR
associated with negative index materials was discovered by Milton and
Nicorovicci in [21] and attracted a lot attention in the scientific community.
Two key figures of this phenomenon are the localized resonance, i.e., the
fields blow up in some regions and remain bounded in some others, and the
connection between the localized resonance and the blow up of the power of the
fields as the loss goes to 0. An important class of negative index materials
for which the localized resonance might appear is the class of reflecting
complementary media introduced in [24]. It was showed in [29] that
complementary property of media is not enough to ensure a connection between
the blow up of the power and the localized resonance. In this paper, we study
CALR for a subclass of complementary media called the class of doubly
complementary media. This class is rich enough to allow us to cloak an
arbitrary source concentrating on an arbitrary smooth bounded manifold of
codimension 1 placed in an arbitrary medium via anomalous localized resonance.
The following three properties are established for doubly complementary media:
1) CALR appears if and only if the power blows up; 2) The power blows up if the
source is near the plasmonic structure; 3) The power remains bounded if the
source is far away from the plasmonic structure. Property 2), the blow up of
the power, is in fact established for reflecting complementary media...

integrated PL intensity of negatively charged excitons is affected
significantly by a magnetic field applied along the sample growth axis. This
observation is explained by a reduction in the electron drift velocity caused

(QSOs); this indicates fast outflows (up to 0.2c) that intercept the observer's
line of sight. These QSOs can be distinguished again into radio-loud (RL) BAL
QSOs and radio-quiet (RQ) BAL QSOs. The first are very rare, even four times
less common than RQ BAL QSOs. The reason for this is still unclear and leaves
open questions about the nature of the BAL-producing outflows and their
connection with the radio jet. We explored the spectroscopic characteristics of
RL and RQ BAL QSOs with the aim to find a possible explanation for the rarity
of RL BAL QSOs. We identified two samples of genuine BAL QSOs from SDSS optical
spectra, one RL and one RQ, in a suitable redshift interval (2.5$<z<$3.5) that
allowed us to observe the Mg II and H$\beta$ emission lines in the adjacent
near-infrared (NIR) band. We collected NIR spectra of the two samples using the
Telescopio Nazionale Galileo (TNG, Canary Islands). By using relations known in
the literature, we estimated the black-hole mass, the broad-line region radius,
and the Eddington ratio of our objects and compared the two samples. We found
no statistically significant differences from comparing the distributions of
the cited physical quantities. This indicates that they have similar
geometries, accretion rates, and central black-hole masses, regardless of
whether the radio-emitting jet is present or not. These results show that the
central engine of BAL QSOs has the same physical properties with and without a
radio jet. The reasons for the rarity of RL BAL QSOs must reside in different
environmental or evolutionary variables.

calculations to study transition metal solutes and their interactions with
point defects in austenite. Clear trends were observed across the series.
Solute-defect interactions were strongly correlated to the solute size factors,
consistent with local strain field effects. Strong correlations with results in
ferrite show insensitivity to the underlying crystal structure in Fe. Oversized
solutes act as strong traps for vacancy and self-interstitial defects and as
nucleation sites for the development of proto-voids and small self-interstitial
loops. The reduction in defect mobility and net defect concentrations explains
the observed radiation-damage resistance in austenitic steels doped with
oversized solutes. Oversized solutes remaining dissolved in oxide
dispersion-strengthened (ODS) steels could contribute to their radiation-damage
resistance. Ni and Co diffuse more slowly than Fe, along with any vacancy flux
produced under irradiation below a critical temperature, which is 400 K for Co
and their concentrations should be enhanced at defect sinks. Cr and Cu diffuse
more quickly than Fe, against a vacancy flux and will be depleted at defect
sinks. Oversized solutes early in the transition metal series form
highly-stable solute-centred divacancy (SCD) defects with a nearest-neighbour
vacancy. The vacancy-mediated diffusion of these solutes is dominated by the
dissociation and reassociation of the SCDs, with a lower activation energy than
for self-diffusion, which has important implications for the nucleation and
growth of complex oxide nanoparticles containing these solutes in ODS steels.
Interstitial-mediated solute diffusion is energetically disfavoured for all
except Cr, Mn, Co and Ni. The central role that solute size plays in the
results presented here means they should apply to other solvent metals and
alloys.

determine a feasible schedule on a minimum number of machines. We rigorously
study this problem and derive various algorithms with small constant
competitive ratios for interesting restricted problem variants. As the most
important special case, we consider scheduling jobs with agreeable deadlines.
We provide the first constant ratio competitive algorithm for the
non-preemptive setting, which is of particular interest with regard to the
known strong lower bound of n for the general problem. For the preemptive
setting, we show that the natural algorithm LLF achieves a constant ratio for
agreeable jobs, while for general jobs it has a lower bound of Omega(n^(1/3)).
We also give an O(log n)-competitive algorithm for the general preemptive
problem, which improves upon the known O(p_max/p_min)-competitive algorithm.
Our algorithm maintains a dynamic partition of the job set into loose and tight
jobs and schedules each (temporal) subset individually on separate sets of
machines. The key is a characterization of how the decrease in the relative
laxity of jobs influences the optimum number of machines. To achieve this we
derive a compact expression of the optimum value, which might be of independent
interest. We complement the general algorithmic result by showing lower bounds
that rule out that other known algorithms may yield a similar performance

the question to what extent such oscillations can be induced by external

induced by rhythmic acoustic stimulation. Human subjects were examined in three
conditions: (i) with tones presented at a rate of 0.8 Hz (`0.8-Hz
stimulation'); (ii) with tones presented at a random sequence (`random
stimulation'); and (iii) with no tones presented in a control condition
(`sham'). Stimulation started during wakefulness before sleep and continued for
the first $\sim$90 min of sleep. Compared with the other two conditions, 0.8-Hz
stimulation significantly delayed sleep onset. However, once sleep was
established, 0.8-Hz stimulation significantly increased and entrained
endogenous slow oscillation activity. Sleep after the 90-min period of
stimulation did not differ between the conditions. Our data show that rhythmic
acoustic stimulation can be used to effectively enhance slow oscillation
activity. However, the effect depends on the brain state, requiring the

Unfortunately passwords are often forgotten and replacement is expensive and
inconvenient. Some people write their passwords down but these records can
easily be lost or stolen. The option we explore is to find a way to cue
passwords securely. The specific cueing technique we report on in this paper
employs images as cues. The idea is to elicit textual descriptions of the
images, which can then be used as passwords. We have defined a set of metrics
for the kind of image that could function effectively as a password cue. We
identified five candidate image types and ran an experiment to identify the
image class with the best performance in terms of the defined metrics.
  The first experiment identified inkblot-type images as being superior. We
tested this image, called a cueblot, in a real-life environment. We allowed
users to tailor their cueblot until they felt they could describe it, and they
then entered a description of the cueblot as their password. The cueblot was
displayed at each subsequent authentication attempt to cue the password.
Unfortunately, we found that users did not exploit the cueing potential of the
cueblot, and while there were a few differences between textual descriptions of
cueblots and non-cued passwords, they were not compelling. Hence our attempts
to alleviate the difficulties people experience with passwords, by giving them
access to a tailored cue, did not have the desired effect. We have to conclude
that the password mechanism might well be unable to benefit from bolstering
activities such as this one.

introduced by the reduction process. However, straightforward implementations
of standard residual based estimators show poor numerical stability, rendering
them unusable if high accuracy is required. In this work we propose a new
algorithm based on representing the residual with respect to a dedicated
orthonormal basis, which is both easy to implement and requires little
additional computational overhead. A numerical example is given to demonstrate
the performance of the proposed algorithm.

(Personal Identification Numbers) in order to do their daily business, and they
often have difficulties due to human memory limitations. One way of helping
them could be by providing cues during the PIN entry process. The provision of
cues that would only be helpful to the PIN owner is challenging because the cue
should only make sense to the legitimate user, and not to a random observer. In
this paper we report on an empirical study where we added colour to the PINpad
to provide an implicit memory cue to PINpad users. We compared the impact of
colour PINpads as opposed to grey ones. As expected, the ability to recall a
PIN deteriorated significantly over time irrespective of the type of PINpad
used. However, there was ultimately no improvement in the ability to recall
PINs when using colour PINpads.

change this mindset by introducing memory-assisted
measurement-device-independent QKD (MDI-QKD), which imposes less stringent

which satisfy the main two requirements of having short access times and large

multiple-excitation effects in such memories can be so detrimental that they
may wash away the scaling improvement offered by memory-equipped systems. We
then propose an alternative setup that can in principle remedy the above

limited steps in eccentricity and semimajor axis can trigger the formation of a
debris disk by stirring an initially quiet planetesimal belt. The variety of
possible effects that planet--planet scattering can have on the formation of
debris disks is analysed and the statistical probability of the different

clocks, including clocks that step computers through their phases of
computation and clocks in space vehicles that supply evidence of signal
propagation explained by hypotheses of spacetimes with metric tensor fields.
  The propagation of logical symbols from one computer to another requires a
shared rhythm---like a bucket brigade. Here we show how hypothesized metric
tensors, dependent on guesswork, take part in the logical synchronization by
which clocks are steered in rate and position toward aiming points that satisfy
phase constraints, thereby linking the physics of signal propagation with the
sharing of logical symbols among computers.
  Recognizing the dependence of the phasing of symbol arrivals on guesses about
signal propagation transports logical synchronization from the engineering of
digital communications to a discipline essential to physics. Within this
discipline we begin to explore questions invisible under any concept of time

established by Peng's G-stochastic calculus. The process of stock price is
described by generalized geometric G-Brownian motion in which the mean
uncertainty may move together with or regardless of the volatility uncertainty.
On the hedging market, the upper price of an (exotic) option is derived
following the Black-Scholes-Barenblatt equation. It is interesting that the
corresponding Barenblatt equation does not depend on the risk preference of
investors and the mean-uncertainty of underlying stocks. Hence under some
appropriate sublinear expectation, neither the risk preference of investors nor
the mean-uncertainty of underlying stocks pose effects on our super and
subhedging strategies. Appropriate definitions of arbitrage for super and
sub-hedging strategies are presented such that the super and sub-hedging prices
are reasonable. Especially the condition of arbitrage for sub-hedging strategy
fills the gap of the theory of arbitrage under model uncertainty. Finally we
show that the term $K$ of finite-variance arising in the super-hedging strategy

fully relativistic electron jitter velocities and in the context of the laser
wakefield acceleration scheme. The study is applied to the specifications
available at present time, or planned for the near future, of the Ti:Sa
Frascati Laser for Acceleration and Multidisciplinary Experiments (FLAME) in
Frascati. Novel nonlinear equation is derived by a three-timescale description,
with an intermediate timescale associated with the nonlinear phase of the laser
wave. They describe on an equal footing both the strong and moderate laser
intensity regimes, pertinent to the core and the edges of the pulse. These have
fundamentally different dispersive properties since, in the core, the electrons
are almost completely expelled by a very strong ponderomotive force and the
electromagnetic wave packet is imbedded in a vacuum channel and has (almost)
linear properties, while at the pulse edges the laser amplitude is smaller and
the wave is dispersive. The nonlinear phase provides a transition to a
nondispersive electromagnetic wave at large intensities and the saturation of
the previously known nonlocal cubic nonlinearity, without the violation of the
imposed scaling laws. The temporal evolution of the laser pulse is studied by
the numerical solution of the model equations in a two-dimensional geometry,
with the spot diameter presently used in the self-injection test experiment
(SITE) with FLAME. The most stable initial pulse length is found to be around 1
$\mu$m, which is several times shorter than presently available. A stretching
of the laser pulse is observed, followed by the development of a vacuum channel
and a very large electrostatic wake potential, as well as the bending of the
laser wave front.

We find that the fluctuating model is more robust than Poncela et al's in that
cooperation flourishes for a wide variety of initial conditions. In terms of
both the temptation to defect, and the types of strategies present in the
founder network, the fluctuating population is found to lead more securely to
cooperation. Further, we find that this model will also support the emergence
of cooperation from pre-existing non-cooperative random networks. This model,
like Poncela et al's, does not require agents to have memory, recognition of
other agents, or other cognitive abilities, and so may suggest a more general
explanation of the emergence of cooperation in early evolutionary transitions,

representing the available E.Coli proteins in terms of graphs. We first analyze
those graphs by considering pure topological characterizations, i.e., by
analyzing the mass fractal dimension and the distribution underlying both
shortest paths and vertex degrees. Results confirm the general architectural
principles of proteins. Successively, we focus on the statistical properties of
a representation of such graphs in terms of vectors composed of several
numerical features, which we extracted from their structural representation. We
found that protein size is the main discriminator for the solubility, while
however there are other factors that help explaining the solubility degree. We
finally analyze such data through a novel one-class classifier, with the aim of
discriminating among very and poorly soluble proteins. Results are encouraging
and consolidate the potential of pattern recognition techniques when employed

oriented towards finding hard partitionings of undirected networks. Despite the
increasing number of fuzzy clustering methods for directed networks, many of

role in defining how well nodes in a module are interconnected. We will show
that cycle decomposition of a random walk process connects the notion of
network modules and information transport in a network, leading to a new,

that although being time-reversible it inherits all necessary information about

proceed by recording complex or modulated data from which a ""wrapped"" phase is
extracted. Although 1-D phase unwrapping is trivial, a challenge remains in
higher dimensions to overcome two common problems: noise and discontinuities in
the true phase image. In contrast to state-of-the-art techniques, this work
aims at simultaneously unwrap and denoise the phase image. We propose a robust
convex optimization approach that enforces data fidelity constraints expressed
in the corrupted phase derivative domain while promoting a sparse phase prior.
The resulting optimization problem is solved by the Chambolle-Pock primal-dual
scheme. We show that under different observation noise levels, our approach
compares favorably to those that perform the unwrapping and denoising in two

retraining. Given a classification problem, and a classifier trained on a small
number of labelled examples, consider the selection of a single further
example. This example will be labelled by the oracle and then used to retrain
the classifier. This example selection raises a central question: given a fully
specified stochastic description of the classification problem, which example
is the optimal selection? If optimality is defined in terms of loss, this
definition directly produces expected loss reduction (ELR), a central quantity
whose maximum yields the optimal example selection. This work presents a new
theoretical approach to AL, example quality, which defines optimal AL behaviour
in terms of ELR. Once optimal AL behaviour is defined mathematically, reasoning
about this abstraction provides insights into AL. In a theoretical context the
optimal selection is compared to existing AL methods, showing that heuristics
can make sub-optimal selections. Algorithms are constructed to estimate example
quality directly. A large-scale experimental study shows these algorithms to be

Dirac materials within the framework of Landauer-B\""uttiker formalism. Charge
carriers in normal metal satisfying the Schr\""odinger equation, can be split
into four-component with appropriate matching conditions at the boundary with
the three dimensional Dirac material (3DDM). We calculate the conductance and
the Fano factor of an interface separating 3DDM from a normal metal, as well as
the conductance through a slab of 3DDM. Under certain circumstances the 3DDM
appears transparent to electrons hitting the 3DDM. We find that electrons
hitting the metal-3DDM interface from metallic side can enter 3DDM in a
reversed spin state as soon as their angle of incidence deviates from the the
direction perpendicular to interface. However the presence of a second
interface completely cancels this effect.

a sequence of binary markets approximating the fractional Black-Scholes model.
This approximating sequence was constructed by Sottinen and named fractional
binary markets. Since, in the frictionless case, these markets admit arbitrage,
we aim to determine the size of the transaction costs needed to eliminate the
arbitrage from these models. To gain more insight, we first consider only
1-step trading strategies and we prove that arbitrage opportunities appear when
the transaction costs are of order $o(1/\sqrt{N})$. Next, we characterize the
asymptotic behavior of the smallest transaction costs $\lambda_c^{(N)}$, called
""critical"" transaction costs, starting from which the arbitrage disappears.
Since the fractional Black-Scholes model is arbitrage-free under arbitrarily
small transaction costs, one could expect that $\lambda_c^{(N)}$ converges to
zero. However, the true behavior of $\lambda_c^{(N)}$ is opposed to this
intuition. More precisely, we show, with the help of a new family of trading
strategies, that $\lambda_c^{(N)}$ converges to one. We explain this apparent
contradiction and conclude that it is appropriate to see the fractional binary
markets as a large financial market and to study its asymptotic arbitrage
opportunities. Finally, we construct a $1$-step asymptotic arbitrage in this
large market when the transaction costs are of order $o(1/N^H)$, whereas for
constant transaction costs, we prove that no such opportunity exists.

parallelisation of the standard particle filter, that consists in splitting the
computational budget into $M$ fully independent particle filters with $N$
particles each, and then obtaining the desired estimators by averaging over the
$M$ independent outcomes of the filters. This approach minimises the
parallelisation overhead yet displays highly desirable theoretical properties.
Under very mild assumptions, we analyse the mean square error (MSE) of the
estimators of 1-dimensional statistics of the optimal filtering distribution
and show explicitly the effect of parallelisation scheme on the convergence
rate. Specifically, we study the decomposition of the MSE into variance and
bias components, to show that the former decays as $\frac{1}{MN}$, i.e.,
linearly with the total number of particles, while the latter converges towards
$0$ as $\frac{1}{N^2}$. Parallelisation, therefore, has the obvious advantage
of dividing the running times while preserving the (asymptotic) performance of
the particle filter. Following this lead, we propose a time-error index to
compare schemes with different degrees of parallelisation. Finally, we provide
two numerical examples. The first one deals with the tracking of a Lorenz 63
chaotic system with dynamical noise and partial (noisy) observations, while the
second example involves a dynamical network of modified FitzHugh-Nagumo (FH-N)
stochastic nodes. The latter is a large dimensional system ($\approx3,000$
state variables in our computer experiments) designed to numerically reproduce
typical electrical phenomena observed in the atria of the human heart. In both
examples, we show how the proposed parallelisation scheme attains the same
approximation accuracy as a centralised particle filter with only a small

Specifically, we consider the nonlinear dynamics of an atomic Bose-Einstein
condensate contained within an optical cavity subject to continuous monitoring
of the light leaking out of the cavity. The classical trajectories encode
within a classical phase-space representation a continuous quantum measurement
process conditioned on a given detection record. We derive a Fokker-Planck
equation for the quasi-probability distribution of the combined
condensate-cavity system. We unravel the dynamics into stochastic classical
trajectories that are conditioned on the quantum measurement process of the
continuously monitored system, and that these trajectories faithfully represent
measurement records of individual experimental runs. Since the dynamics of a
continuously measured observable in a many-atom system can be closely
approximated by classical dynamics, the method provides a numerically efficient
and accurate approach to calculate the measurement record of a large multimode
quantum system. Numerical simulations of the continuously monitored dynamics of
a large atom cloud reveal considerably fluctuating phase profiles between
different measurement trajectories, while ensemble averages exhibit local
spatially varying phase decoherence. Individual measurement trajectories lead
to spatial pattern formation and optomechanical motion that solely result from
the measurement backaction. The backaction of the continuous quantum
measurement process, conditioned on the detection record of the photons,
spontaneously breaks the symmetry of the spatial profile of the condensate and
can be tailored to selectively excite collective modes.

we give existence and uniqueness criteria in weighted function spaces that
depend on integrability properties of the kernel and the characteristics of the
L\'evy basis. Particular attention is devoted to equations with stationary
solutions, or more generally, to equations with infinite memory, that is, where
the time domain of integration starts at minus infinity. Here, in contrast to
the case where time is positive, the usual integrability conditions on the
kernel are no longer sufficient for the existence and uniqueness of solutions,
but we have to impose additional size conditions on the kernel and the L\'evy
characteristics. Furthermore, once the existence of a solution is guaranteed,
we analyse its asymptotic stability, that is, whether its moments remain
bounded when time goes to infinity. Stability is proved whenever kernel and
characteristics are small enough, or the nonlinearity of the equation exhibits

anisotropic basis sets that have more terms in important dimensions and limits
the number of unimportant terms that increase mutual coherence and thus degrade
the performance of $\ell_1$-minimization. The important features and the
accuracy of basis selection are demonstrated with a number of numerical
examples. Specifically, we show that for a given computational budget, basis
selection produces a more accurate PCE than would be obtained if the basis is

functions, called `distance zeta functions', which since then, has enabled us
to extend the existing theory of zeta functions of fractal strings and sprays
to arbitrary bounded (fractal) sets in Euclidean spaces of any dimension. A
natural and closely related tool for the study of distance zeta functions is
the class of 'tube zeta functions', defined using the tube function of a
fractal set. These three classes of zeta functions, under the name of 'fractal
zeta functions', exhibit deep connections with Minkowski contents and upper box
dimensions, as well as, more generally, with the complex dimensions of fractal
sets. Further extensions include zeta functions of relative fractal drums, the
box dimension of which can assume negative values, including minus infinity. We
also survey some results concerning the existence of the meromorphic extensions
of the spectral zeta functions of fractal drums, based in an essential way on
earlier results of the first author on the spectral (or eigenvalue) asymptotics
of fractal drums. It follows from these results that the associated spectral
zeta function has a (nontrivial) meromorphic extension, and we use some of our
results about fractal zeta functions to show the new fact according to which
the upper bound obtained for the corresponding abscissa of meromorphic
convergence is optimal. Finally, we conclude this survey article by proposing
several open problems and directions for future research in this area.

compactified cosmic string on background of de Sitter spacetime. The currents
are induced by magnetic fluxes running along the cosmic string and enclosed by
the compact dimension. We show that the vacuum charge and the radial component
of the current density vanish. By using the Abel-Plana summation formula, the
azimuthal and axial currents are explicitly decomposed into two parts: the
first one corresponds to the geometry of a straight cosmic string and the
second one is induced by the compactification of the string along its axis. For
the axial current the first part vanishes and the corresponding topological
part is an even periodic function of the magnetic flux along the string axis
and an odd periodic function of the flux enclosed by the compact dimension with
the periods equal to the flux quantum. The azimuthal current density is an odd
periodic function of the flux along the string axis and an even periodic
function of the flux enclosed by the compact dimension with the same period.
Depending on the magnetic fluxes, the planar angle deficit can either enhance
or reduce the azimuthal and axial currents. The influence of the background
gravitational field on the vacuum currents is crucial at distances from the
string larger than the de Sitter curvature radius. In particular, for the
geometry of a straight cosmic string and for a massive fermionic field, we show
that the decay of the azimuthal current density is damping oscillatory with the
amplitude inversely proportional to the fourth power of the distance from the
string. This behavior is in clear contrast with the case of the string in
Minkowski bulk where the current density is exponentially suppressed at large
distances.

the new field of rocky exoplanets characterisation. To better understand this
interesting system, new observations were taken with the CoRoT satellite.
During this run 90 new transits were obtained in the imagette mode. These were
analysed together with the previous 151 transits obtained in the discovery run
and HARPS radial velocity observations to derive accurate system parameters. A
difference is found in the posterior probability distribution of the transit
parameters between the previous CoRoT run (LRa01) and the new run (LRa06). We
propose this is due to an extra noise component in the previous CoRoT run
suspected to be transit spot occultation events. These lead to the mean transit
shape becoming V-shaped. We show that the extra noise component is dominant at
low stellar flux levels and reject these transits in the final analysis. We
obtained a planetary radius, $R_p= 1.585\pm0.064\,R_{\oplus}$, in agreement
with previous estimates. Combining the planetary radius with the new mass
estimates results in a planetary density of $ 1.19 \pm 0.27\, \rho_{\oplus}$

excellent test bed for the effects of activity in the derivation of planetary

of complex scalar fields, say $\phi$ and $\theta$, that can be interpreted as
maps $\phi,\theta: S^3\mapsto S^2$, the level lines of which are orthogonal to
one another, where $S^3$ is the compactified physical 3-space $R^3$, with only
one point at infinity, and $S^2$ is the 2-sphere identified with the complete

mathematician H. Hopf, who showed that the set of all of them can be ordered in
homotopy classes, labeled by the so called Hopf index, equal to $\gamma=\pm
1,\,\pm 2,\,\cdots ,\, \pm k,...$ but without $\gamma=0$. In the model
presented here and at the level of the scalars $\phi$ and $\theta$, the
equations of motion are highly nonlinear; however there is a transformation of

colors of the dustiest AGB stars for which the chemistry could be O-rich.
Finally, the fitting of GRAMS models to SEDs of sources fit by other studies
provides additional verification of our grid and anticipates future, more
expansive efforts.

- 1 line using the Submillimeter Array (SMA) with angular resolution of 1 - 4
arcseconds. These stars have been detected previously at infrared wavelengths,
and several of them have OH maser emission. We detect CO J = 2 - 1 emission
from three of the sources in the sample: OH 359.943 +0.260, [SLO2003] A12, and
[SLO2003] A51. We do not detect the remaining 5 stars in the sample because of
heavy contamination from the galactic foreground CO emission. Combining CO data
with observations at infrared wavelengths constraining dust mass loss from
these stars, we determine the gas-to-dust ratios of the Galactic Bulge stars
for which CO emission is detected. For OH 359.943 +0.260, we determine a gas
mass-loss rate of 7.9 (+/- 2.2) x 10^-5 M_Sun/year and a gas-to-dust ratio of
310 (+/- 89). For [SLO2003] A12, we find a gas mass-loss rate of 5.4 (+/- 2.8)
x 10^-5 M_Sun/year and a gas-to-dust ratio of 220 (+/- 110). For [SLO2003] A51,
we find a gas mass-loss rate of 3.4 (+/- 3.0) x 10^-5 M_Sun/year and a
gas-to-dust ratio of 160 (+/- 140), reflecting the low quality of our tentative
detection of the CO J = 2 - 1 emission from A51. We find the CO J = 2 - 1
detections of OH/IR stars in the Galactic Bulge require lower average CO J = 2
- 1 backgrounds.

processes leading to the emergence of life. Existing models either (i) describe
protocell architecture and dynamics, given the existence of sets of
collectively self-replicating molecules for granted, or (ii) describe the
emergence of the aforementioned sets from an ensemble of random molecules in a
simple experimental setting (e.g. a closed system or a steady-state flow
reactor) that does not properly describe a protocell. In this paper we present
a model that goes beyond these limitations by describing the dynamics of sets
of replicating molecules within a lipid vesicle. We adopt the simplest possible
protocell architecture, by considering a semi-permeable membrane that selects
the molecular types that are allowed to enter or exit the protocell and by
assuming that the reactions take place in the aqueous phase in the internal
compartment. As a first approximation, we ignore the protocell growth and
division dynamics. The behavior of catalytic reaction networks is then
simulated by means of a stochastic model that accounts for the creation and the
extinction of species and reactions. While this is not yet an exhaustive
protocell model, it already provides clues regarding some processes that are
relevant for understanding the conditions that can enable a population of
protocells to undergo evolution and selection.

  and Localization",,,,,"cs.NI cs.ET","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  RF sensor networks are used to localize people indoor without requiring them
to wear invasive electronic devices. These wireless mesh networks, formed by
low-power radio transceivers, continuously measure the received signal strength
(RSS) of the links. Radio Tomographic Imaging (RTI) is a technique that
generates 2D images of the change in the electromagnetic field inside the area
covered by the radio transceivers to spot the presence and movements of
animates (e.g., people, large animals) or large metallic objects (e.g., cars).
Here, we present a RTI system for localizing and tracking people outdoors.
Differently than in indoor environments where the RSS does not change
significantly with time unless people are found in the monitored area, the
outdoor RSS signal is time-variant, e.g., due to rainfalls or wind-driven
foliage. We present a novel outdoor RTI method that, despite the nonstationary
noise introduced in the RSS data by the environment, achieves high localization
accuracy and dramatically reduces the energy consumption of the sensing units.
Experimental results demonstrate that the system accurately detects and tracks
a person in real-time in a large forested area under varying environmental
conditions, significantly reducing false positives, localization error and
energy consumption compared to state-of-the-art RTI methods.
