method, using any well-defined update matrix from the one-parameter Broyden
family of updates, produce identical iterates on a quadratic problem with
positive-definite Hessian. This equivalence does not hold for any quasi-Newton
method. We define precisely the conditions on the update matrix in the
quasi-Newton method that give rise to this behavior. We show that the crucial
facts are, that the range of each update matrix lies in the last two dimensions
of the Krylov subspaces defined by the conjugate gradient method and that the
quasi-Newton condition is satisfied. In the framework based on a sufficient
condition to obtain mutually conjugate search directions, we show that the
one-parameter Broyden family is complete.
  A one-to-one correspondence between the Broyden parameter and the non-zero
scaling of the search direction obtained from the corresponding quasi-Newton
method compared to the one obtained in the conjugate gradient method is
derived. In addition, we show that the update matrices from the one-parameter
Broyden family are almost always well-defined on a quadratic problem with
positive-definite Hessian. The only exception is when the symmetric rank-one
update is used and the unit steplength is taken in the same iteration. In this
case it is the Broyden parameter that becomes undefined.

dedicated analyses, LHCb will be able to further improve the bounds on $CPT$
violation in the $D^0$, $B^0$ and $B_s^0$ systems. Since $CPT$ violation
implies violation of Lorentz invariance in an interacting local quantum field
theory, the observed $CPT$ asymmetry will exhibit sidereal- and boost-dependent
variations. Such $CPT$-violating and Lorentz-violating effects are accommodated
in the framework of the Standard-Model Extension (SME). The large boost of the
neutral mesons produced at LHCb results in a high sensitivity to the
corresponding SME coefficients. For the $B^0$ and $B_s^0$ systems, using
existing LHCb results, we determine with high precision the SME coefficients
that are not varying with sidereal time. With a full sidereal analysis, LHCb
will be able to improve the existing SME bounds in the $D^0$, $B^0$ and $B_s^0$

exploited the Euclidean domain structure of the chosen ring. However, our
proposal is immune against such attacks, without losing the advantages of
non-commutative polynomial rings as outlined by Boucher et al. Moreover, our
extension is not restricted to any particular ring, but is designed to allow
users to readily choose from a large class of rings when applying the protocol.
Our primitive can also be applied to other cryptographic paradigms. In
particular, we develop a three-pass protocol, a public key cryptosystem, a
digital signature scheme and a zero-knowledge proof protocol.

phenomena are affected by the pumping and decay at long times and how the

Josephson junction pumped on one side and study its dynamics within a

multi-stability of the stationary states, which are sensitive to the initial
conditions and incoherent noises. These states can be attributed to either the
self-trapping effect or the parity-time (PT) symmetry of the system. These
results can be used to explain the emission spectra and the $\pi$-phase locking
observed in recent experiments. We further predict that the multi-stability can
reduce to the self-trapped state if the PT symmetry is broken. Moreover, the

The model suggests a new approach which take into account the quantity of light
transmitted through the planetary atmosphere and the thermal emissions from the
night side of the planet, to describe the transmission spectrum of HD189733b in
photometric study. The availability of measures in different wavelengths has
allowed us to validate our model with more efficiency. We found an agreement
between our transmission spectrum model of HD189733b and data from the infrared
to the UV. The model predicts a value of $R_p /R_\star$ $= 0.1516$ at $7.3 \mu
m$, which is a low value compared to all observations at different wavelengths.
We interpreted this value by a fluorescence emission from sulphur dioxide
($SO_2$). Therefore, the likely presence of these molecules in the atmosphere
of HD 189733b. The second objective of this paper is to study the effect of
starspots on the transmission spectrum of this hot-Jupiter. To reach this goal,
we developed an analytical theory considered as an extension of the approach
proposed by Berta et al. (2011). The model shows clearly that the unocculted
spots would significantly increase the transit radius ratio at visible and
near-ultraviolet wavelengths, while having a minimal impact at infrared
wavelengths. Therefore, the wavelength dependence of the spots effect has been
clearly shown by this new model. At the end of this paper, we reported the way
in which this model can provide an estimation of the percentage of the
unocculted spots area relative to stellar disk area for an observation of

collisional transport and energy injection. Intrinsic rotation is determined by
the balance between the momentum redistribution and the turbulent diffusion and
convection. Two different turbulence regimes are considered: turbulence with
characteristic perpendicular lengths of the order of the ion gyroradius,
$\rho_i$, and turbulence with characteristic lengths of the order of the
poloidal gyroradius, $(B/B_p) \rho_i$. Intrinsic rotation driven by gyroradius
scale turbulence is mainly due to the effect of neoclassical corrections and of
finite orbit widths on turbulent momentum transport, whereas for the intrinsic
rotation driven by poloidal gyroradius scale turbulence, the slow variation of
turbulence characteristics in the radial and poloidal directions and the
turbulent particle acceleration can be become as important as the neoclassical
and finite orbit width effects. The magnetic drift is shown to be indispensable
for the intrinsic rotation driven by the slow variation of turbulence
characteristics and the turbulent particle acceleration. The equations are
written in a form conducive to implementation in a flux tube code, and the
effect of the radial variation of the turbulence is included in a novel way

identification of a q-Gaussian distribution from empirical data was done by a
measure of its tail weight using robust statistics. Numerical methods were used
to generate artificial data, to find out the tail weight -- medcouple, and also
to adjust the curve between medcouple and the q value. We showed that the
medcouple value remains unchanged when the calculation is applied to data which
have long memory. A routine was made to calculate the q value and its standard

of graphs in the dynamic semi-streaming model. Given a single pass over a
stream containing insertions and deletions of edges to a graph G, our algorithm
maintains a randomized linear sketch of the incidence matrix of G into
dimension O((1/epsilon^2) n polylog(n)). Using this sketch, at any point, the
algorithm can output a (1 +/- epsilon) spectral sparsifier for G with high
probability.
  While O((1/epsilon^2) n polylog(n)) space algorithms are known for computing
""cut sparsifiers"" in dynamic streams [AGM12b, GKP12] and spectral sparsifiers
in ""insertion-only"" streams [KL11], prior to our work, the best known single
pass algorithm for maintaining spectral sparsifiers in dynamic streams required
sketches of dimension Omega((1/epsilon^2) n^(5/3)) [AGM14].
  To achieve our result, we show that, using a coarse sparsifier of G and a
linear sketch of G's incidence matrix, it is possible to sample edges by
effective resistance, obtaining a spectral sparsifier of arbitrary precision.
Sampling from the sketch requires a novel application of ell_2/ell_2 sparse
recovery, a natural extension of the ell_0 methods used for cut sparsifiers in
[AGM12b]. Recent work of [MP12] on row sampling for matrix approximation gives
a recursive approach for obtaining the required coarse sparsifiers.
  Under certain restrictions, our approach also extends to the problem of
maintaining a spectral approximation for a general matrix A^T A given a stream
of updates to rows in A.

this method we show that voids in simulation are exactly self-similar, meaning
that their average rescaled profile does not depend on the void size. Within
the range of our simulation we also find no redshift dependence of the profile.
Comparison of the profiles obtained from simulated and real voids shows an
excellent match. The profiles of real voids also show a universal behaviour
over a wide range of galaxy luminosities, number densities and redshifts. This
points to a fundamental property of the voids found by the watershed algorithm,

The fraction of distinct eigenvalues exhibits a `chaotic' behaviour in the

stations (small-BSs) to the core network. We exploit the effective application
layer semantics of both spatial and temporal locality to reduce the backhaul
traffic. Specifically, small-BSs are equipped with storage facility to cache
contents requested by users. As the {\em cache hit ratio} increases, most of
the users' requests can be satisfied locally without incurring traffic over the
backhaul. To make informed caching decisions, the mobility patterns of users
must be carefully considered as users might frequently migrate from one small
cell to another. We study the issue of mobility-aware content caching, which is
formulated into an optimization problem with the objective to maximize the
caching utility. As the problem is NP-complete, we develop a polynomial-time
heuristic solution termed {\em MobiCacher} with bounded approximation ratio. We
also conduct trace-based simulations to evaluate the performance of {\em

emission is described well by a power law, while flat spectral indices in the
central region indicate thermal absorption. We observe that the disk extends
out to 16 kpc and see a break in the radial profile near the optical radius of
the disk. Our main results, the scale lengths of the inner and outer disks at
151 MHz and 1.4 GHz, arm--interarm contrast, and the break scales of the
radio--far-infrared correlations, can be explained consistently by CRE
diffusion, leading to a longer propagation length of CRE of lower energy. The
distribution of CRE sources drops sharply at about 10 kpc radius, where the
star formation rate also decreases sharply. We find evidence that thermal
absorption is primarily caused by HII regions. The non-detection of
polarisation from M51 at 151 MHz is consistent with the estimates of Faraday
depolarisation. Future searches for polarised emission in this frequency range
should concentrate on regions with low star formation rates.

properties of 300 galaxies from the CALIFA integral field survey to investigate
how the stellar metallicity (Z*) relates to the total stellar mass (M*) and the
local mass surface density ($\mu$*) in both spheroidal and disk dominated
galaxies. The galaxies are shown to follow a clear stellar mass-metallicity
relation (MZR) over the whole 10$^9$ to 10$^{12}$ M$_{\odot}$ range. This
relation is steeper than the one derived from nebular abundances, which is
similar to the flatter stellar MZR derived when we consider only young stars.
We also find a strong relation between the local values of $\mu$* and Z* (the
$\mu$ZR), betraying the influence of local factors in determining Z*. This
shows that both local ($\mu$*-driven) and global (M*-driven) processes are
important in determining the metallicity in galaxies. We find that the overall
balance between local and global effects varies with the location within a
galaxy. In disks, $\mu$* regulates Z*, producing a strong $\mu$ZR whose
amplitude is modulated by M*. In spheroids it is M* who dominates the physics
of star formation and chemical enrichment, with $\mu$* playing a minor,
secondary role. These findings agree with our previous analysis of the star
formation histories of CALIFA galaxies, which showed that mean stellar ages are
mainly governed by surface density in galaxy disks and by total mass in
spheroids.

building upon our previous work, we consider an early population of sources and
start the radiative-transfer calculation at redshifts z>=5. Our model
faithfully reproduces the emissivity of optically selected AGNs as inferred
from measurements of their luminosity function. We find that HeII reionization
is very extended in redshift ({\Delta} z>=2) and highly spatially
inhomogeneous. In fact, mock spectra extracted from the simulations show a
large variability in the evolution of the HeII effective optical depth within
chunks of size {\Delta} z=0.04. Regions with low opacity
({\tau}^{eff}_{HeII}<3) can be found at high redshift, in agreement with the
most recent observations of UV-transmitting quasars. At the highest redshift
currently probed by observations (z~3.4), our updated model predicts a much
lower HeII effective optical depth than previous simulations in the literature
relieving most of the tension with the current data, that, however, still
persists at about the (Gaussian) 1{\sigma} to 2{\sigma} level. Given the very
small number of observed lines of sight, our analysis indicates that current

Compton dominated and thermal dominated states, typically observed in black
hole LMXBs, are also common in neutron star systems. These patterns, which also
sample intermediate states, are found when looking at the evolution of both
X-ray colour and fast variability of ten systems accreting below ~ 30 % of the
Eddington Luminosity. We show that hysteresis does not require large changes in
luminosity and it is the natural form that state transitions take at these
luminosities. At higher accretion rates neutron stars do not show hysteresis,
and they remain in a thermal dominated, low variability state, characterized by
flaring behaviour and fast colour changes. Only at luminosities close to the
Eddington Luminosity, are high variability levels seen again, in correspondence
to an increase in the fractional contribution of the Comptonization component.
We compare this behaviour with that observed in LMXBs harbouring black holes,
showing that the spectral, timing and multi-wavelength properties of a given
source can be determined by its location in the fast variability-luminosity
diagram, which, therefore, provides a common framework for neutron star and
black hole accretion states.

onto the flat bands obey exactly the Girvin-MacDonald-Platzman algebra, like
for Landau levels in the continuum in the case of $C=1$, or obey its
straightforward generalization in the case of $C>1$. This allows a mapping
between density-density interaction Hamiltonians for particles in the

sends it off, a receiver which measures some property of the transmitted

the transmitter and the receiver over which the TPO is sent. The object of the
game here is to characterize the TPO, either as an end in itself (research), or
to examine its potential for information transmittal (communication). If the
TPO is a 'small' object then quantum mechanics is needed to play this game. In
the course of this work, I hope to broaden the concept of measurement in
quantum mechanics to include noisy measurements and incomplete measurements. I
suggest that quantum density operators are logically associated with the
transmitter and some portion of the path, and that quantum measurement
operators are logically associated with the rest of the path and the receiver.
Communication involves the overlap of a density operator and a measurement
operator. That is, the fundamental conditional probability of the communication
process is given by the trace of the product of a density operator and a
measurement operator.

to play a key role in the evolution of galaxies, heating the ambient gas,

relativistic particles launched by some AGN can both accelerate and heat the
molecular gas, which often dominates the mass budgets of the outflows. However,
clear evidence for this mechanism in the form of detailed associations between
the molecular gas kinematics and features in the radio-emitting jets has been
lacking. Here we show that the warm molecular hydrogen gas in the western radio

privacy in contexts where personal information remains private even from data
analysts. Working in a setting where both the data providers and data analysts
want to maximize the utility of statistical analyses performed on the released
data, we study the fundamental trade-off between local differential privacy and
utility. This trade-off is formulated as a constrained optimization problem:
maximize utility subject to local differential privacy constraints. We
introduce a combinatorial family of extremal privatization mechanisms, which we
call staircase mechanisms, and show that it contains the optimal privatization
mechanisms for a broad class of information theoretic utilities such as mutual
information and $f$-divergences. We further prove that for any utility function
and any privacy level, solving the privacy-utility maximization problem is
equivalent to solving a finite-dimensional linear program, the outcome of which
is the optimal staircase mechanism. However, solving this linear program can be
computationally expensive since it has a number of variables that is
exponential in the size of the alphabet the data lives in. To account for this,
we show that two simple privatization mechanisms, the binary and randomized
response mechanisms, are universally optimal in the low and high privacy
regimes, and well approximate the intermediate regime.

inversions of generative models based on computer graphics have been proposed.
However, applications to 3D perception from natural images have focused on
low-dimensional latent scenes, due to challenges in both modeling and

appearance via realistic generative models seems intractable, as does inverting
even simple versions of the many-to-many computations that link 3D scenes to 2D
images. This paper proposes and evaluates an approach that addresses key
aspects of both these challenges. We show that it is possible to solve
challenging, real-world 3D vision problems by approximate inference in
generative models for images based on rendering the outputs of probabilistic
CAD (PCAD) programs. Our PCAD object geometry priors generate deformable 3D
meshes corresponding to plausible objects and apply affine transformations to
place them in a scene. Image likelihoods are based on similarity in a feature
space based on standard mid-level image representations from the vision
literature. Our inference algorithm integrates single-site and locally blocked
Metropolis-Hastings proposals, Hamiltonian Monte Carlo and discriminative
data-driven proposals learned from training data generated from our models. We
apply this approach to 3D human pose estimation and object shape reconstruction
from single images, achieving quantitative and qualitative performance
improvements over state-of-the-art baselines.

proposed in which the large scales (IR) are treated perturbatively while the
information on the UV, mainly small scale velocity dispersion, is obtained by
nonlinear methods like N-body simulations. Here we develop this approach,
showing that it is possible to reproduce the fully nonlinear power spectrum
(PS) by combining a simple (and fast) 1-loop computation for the IR scales and
the measurement of a single, dominant, correlator from N-body simulations for
the UV ones. We measure this correlator for a suite of seven different
cosmologies, and we show that its inclusion in our perturbation scheme
reproduces the fully non-linear PS with percent level accuracy, for wave
numbers up to $k\sim 0.4\, h~{\rm Mpc^{-1}}$ down to $z=0$. We then show that,
once this correlator has been measured in a given cosmology, there is no need
to run a new simulation for a different cosmology in the suite. Indeed, by
rescaling this correlator by a proper function computable in SPT, the
reconstruction procedure works also for the other cosmologies and for all
redshifts, with comparable accuracy. Finally, we clarify the relation of this
approach to the Effective Field Theory methods recently proposed in the LSS

the planet's atmospheric evolution and habitability and in interpreting the
planet's spectrum. The star's extreme-UV (EUV), far-UV (FUV) and near-UV (NUV)
emission can chemically modify, ionize, and erode the atmosphere over time.
This makes determining the lifetime exposure of such planets to stellar UV
radiation critical for both the evolution of a planet's atmosphere and our
potential to characterize it. Using the early M star members of nearby young
moving groups (YMGs), which sample critical ages in planet formation and
evolution, we measure the GALEX NUV and FUV flux as a function of age. The
median UV flux remains at a ""saturated"" level for a few hundred million years,
analogous to that observed for X-ray emission. By the age of the Hyades Cluster
(650 Myr), we measure a drop in UV flux by a factor of 2-3 followed by a steep
drop from old (several Gyrs) field stars. This decline in activity beyond 300
Myr follows roughly t^{-1}. Despite this clear evolution, there remains a wide
range of 1-2 orders of magnitude in observed emission levels at every age.
These UV data supply the much-needed constraints to M dwarf upper-atmosphere
models, which will provide empirically-motivated EUV predictions and more
accurate age-dependent UV spectra as inputs to planetary photochemical models.

Detecting clusters from heavy noise remains challenging, particularly for
high-dimensional sparse data. Based on graph-theoretic framework, the present
paper proposes a novel algorithm to address this issue. The locally asymmetric
geometries of neighborhoods between data points result in a directed similarity
graph to model the structural connectivity of data points. Performing
similarity propagation on this directed graph simply by its adjacency matrix
powers leads to an interesting discovery, in the sense that if the in-degrees
are ordered by the corresponding sorted out-degrees, they will be
self-organized to be homophilic layers according to the different distributions
of cluster densities, which is dubbed the Homophilic In-degree figure (the HI
figure). With the HI figure, we can easily single out all cores of clusters,
identify the boundary between cluster and noise, and visualize the intrinsic
structures of clusters. Based on the in-degree homophily, we also develop a
simple efficient algorithm of linear space complexity to cluster noisy data.
Extensive experiments on toy and real-world scientific data validate the
effectiveness of our algorithms.

power compensation may result in the reversal of power flows in future

very different from the more traditional power consumption regime. This paper
focused on demonstration of multistability phenomenon in radial distribution
systems with reversed power flow, where multiple stable equilibria co-exist at
the given set of parameters. The system may experience transitions between
different equilibria after being subjected to disturbances such as short-term
losses of distributed generation or transient faults. Convergence to an
undesirable equilibrium places the system in an emergency or \textit{in
extremis} state. Traditional emergency control schemes are not capable of
restoring the system if it gets entrapped in one of the low voltage equilibria.
Moreover, undervoltage load shedding may have a reverse action on the system
and can induce voltage collapse. We propose a novel pulse emergency control
strategy that restores the system to the normal state without any interruption
of power delivery. The results are validated with dynamic simulations of IEEE
$13$-bus feeder performed with SystemModeler software. The dynamic models can
be also used for characterization of the solution branches via a novel approach

defining the heat conduction than the mass density of the graphene laminate.
The thermal conductivity scales up linearly with the average graphene flake
size in both uncompressed and compressed laminates. The compressed laminates
have higher thermal conductivity for the same average flake size owing to
better flake alignment. The possibility of up to 600X enhancement of the
thermal conductivity of plastic materials by coating them with the thin

system of equations with multiple right hand side vectors arises in several
process control contexts. The coefficient and the right hand side matrices are
respectively named data and target matrices. A number of optimization methods
were proposed for solving such problems, in which the data matrix is
unrealistically assumed to be error free. Here, considering error in measured
data and target matrices, we present an approach to solve a positive definite
constrained linear system of equations based on the use of a newly defined
error function. To minimize the defined error function, we derive necessary and
sufficient optimality conditions and outline a direct algorithm to compute the
solution. We provide a comparison of our proposed approach and two existing
methods, the interior point method and a method based on quadratic programming.
Two important characteristics of our proposed method as compared to the
existing methods are computing the solution directly and considering error both
in data and target matrices. Moreover, numerical test results show that the new
approach leads to smaller standard deviations of error entries and smaller
effective rank as desired by control problems. Furthermore, in a comparative
study, using the Dolan-Mor\'{e} performance profiles, we show the approach to
be more efficient.

the arbitrated quantum signature scheme has been considered as one of good

being a successful method. In this paper, we consider one situation, which is
slightly different from the forgery problem, that we check whether at least one
quantum message with signature can be forged in a given scheme, although all
the messages cannot be forged. If there exist only a finite number of forgeable
quantum messages in the scheme then the scheme can be secure against the
forgery attack by not sending the forgeable quantum messages, and so our
situation does not directly imply that we check whether the scheme is secure
against the attack. But, if users run a given scheme without any consideration
of forgeable quantum messages then a sender might transmit such forgeable
messages to a receiver, and an attacker can forge the messages if the attacker
knows them in such a case. Thus it is important and necessary to look into
forgeable quantum messages. We here show that there always exists such a
forgeable quantum message-signature pair for every known scheme with quantum
encryption and rotation, and numerically show that any forgeable quantum
message-signature pairs do not exist in an arbitrated quantum signature scheme.

Multiple Access (MAC) underlay cognitive channels with Line-of-Sight
interference (LoS) from the secondary to the primary network. It is shown that
for $N$ secondary users, and assuming Rician interference channels, the
secondary sum capacity scales like
$\log\left(\frac{K^{2}+K}{\mathcal{W}\left(\frac{K e^{K}}{N}\right)}\right)$,
where $K$ is the $K$-factor of the Rician channels, and $\mathcal{W}(.)$ is the

diversity gain experienced in Rayleigh channels, where the sum capacity grows
like $\log(N)$. To overcome this problem, we propose the usage of single radio
Electronically Steerable Parasitic Array Radiator (ESPAR) antennas at the
secondary mobile terminals. Using ESPAR antennas, we induce artificial
fluctuations in the interference channels to restore the $\log(N)$ growth rate
by assigning random weights to orthogonal {\it basis patterns}. We term this
technique as {\it Random Aerial Beamforming} (RAB). While LoS interference is
originally a source of capacity hindrance, we show that using RAB, it can
actually be exploited to improve multiuser interference diversity by boosting
the {\it effective number of users} with minimal hardware complexity.

on a subset of all probability measures on $\mathbb{R}$ involving the reverse
Kullback-Leibler divergence with respect to a particular distribution and
recursion coefficients related to the orthogonal polynomial construction. The
first sum rule is the Szeg\H{o}-Verblunsky theorem (see Simon (2011) Theorem
1.8.6 p. 29) and concerns the case of trigonometrical polynomials on the torus.
More recently, Killip and Simon (2003) have given a revival interest to this
subject by showing a quite surprising sum rule for measures dominating the
semicircular distribution. Indeed, this sum rule includes a contribution of the
atomic part of the measure away from the support of the circular law. In this
paper, we recover this sum rules by using only large deviations tools on random
matrices. Furthermore, we obtain new (up to our knowledge) magic sum rules for
the reverse Kullback-Leibler divergence with respect to the Pastur-Marchenko or
Kesten-McKay distributions. As in the semicircular case, these formulas
generally include a contribution of the atomic part appearing away from the
support of the reference measure. From the point of view of large deviations,
we obtain these formulas by showing a large deviation principle for the point
mass measure concentrated on random eigenvalues of classical ensembles and
combine it with a large deviation principle due to Gamboa Rouault (2011) for
the recursion coefficients.

behaviour. It is known that even the two-variable monadic fragment is highly
undecidable over various linear timelines, and over branching time even
one-variable fragments might be undecidable. However, there have been several
attempts on finding well-behaved fragments of first-order temporal logics and
related temporal description logics, mostly either by restricting the available
quantifier patterns, or considering sub-Boolean languages. Here we analyse
seemingly `mild' extensions of decidable one-variable fragments with counting
capabilities, interpreted in models with constant, decreasing, and expanding
first-order domains. We show that over most classes of linear orders these
logics are (sometimes highly) undecidable, even without constant and function
symbols, and with the sole temporal operator `eventually'.
  We establish connections with bimodal logics over 2D product structures
having linear and `difference' (inequality) component relations, and prove our
results in this bimodal setting. We show a general result saying that
satisfiability over many classes of bimodal models with commuting linear and
difference relations is undecidable. As a by-product, we also obtain new
examples of finitely axiomatisable but Kripke incomplete bimodal logics. Our
results generalise similar lower bounds on bimodal logics over products of two
linear relations, and our proof methods are quite different from the proofs of
these results. Unlike previous proofs that first `diagonally encode' an
infinite grid, and then use reductions of tiling or Turing machine problems,
here we make direct use of the grid-like structure of product frames and obtain
undecidability by reductions of counter (Minsky) machine problems.

properties of electronic systems. Over the last decade, Berry phase has been
essential to our understanding of new materials, including graphene and

the phase mismatch in quantum oscillation experiments, where electrons
accumulate a phase as they traverse closed cyclotron orbits in momentum space.
The high-temperature cuprate superconductors are a class of materials where the
Berry phase is thus far unknown despite the large body of existing quantum
oscillations data. In this report we present a systematic Berry phase analysis
of Shubnikov - de Haas measurements on the hole-doped cuprates
YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{y}$, YBa$_2$Cu$_4$O$_8$, HgBa$_2$CuO$_{4 + \delta}$, and the
electron-doped cuprate Nd$_{2-x}$Ce$_x$CuO$_4$. For the hole-doped materials, a
trivial Berry phase of 0 mod $2\pi$ is systematically observed whereas the
electron-doped Nd$_{2-x}$Ce$_x$CuO$_4$ exhibits a significant non-zero Berry
phase. These observations set constraints on the nature of the high-field
normal state of the cuprates and points towards contrasting behaviour between
hole-doped and electron-doped materials. We discuss this difference in light of

module of square summable sequences in the base C*-algebra. In this paper, this
result will be generalized by incorporating a densely defined derivation on the
base C*-algebra. This leads to a differentiable version of the Kasparov
absorption theorem. The extra compatibility assumptions needed are minimal: It
will only be required that there exists a sequence of generators with mutual
inner products in the domain of the derivation. The differentiable absorption
theorem is then applied to construct densely defined connections (or
correspondences) on Hilbert C*-modules. These connections can in turn be used
to define selfadjoint and regular ""lifts"" of unbounded operators which act on
an auxiliary Hilbert C*-module.

trivial one. Also, the component parallel to the Zeeman field is symmetric
between positive and negative energies in the topological phase and asymmetric
in the trivial phase. Moreover the SPDOS exhibits a moderate accumulation close
to the SN boundary which changes sign when crossing the topological transition.
We propose that these signatures may allow one to unambiguously test the
formation of a topological phase via spin-resolved transport and STM

handle these issues, we propose a novel linear beamforming across a set of

(i.e. precoding and power control) is formulated as an optimization problem
with objective function of signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratios (SINRs) in

decomposition method, and formulate it as a convex optimization problem. This
method does not require the rank of each mode to be specified beforehand, and
can automatically determine the number of factors in each mode through our
optimization scheme. By considering the low-rank structure of the observed
tensor, we analyze the equivalent relationship of the trace norm between a
low-rank tensor and its core tensor. Then, we cast a non-convex tensor
decomposition model into a weighted combination of multiple much smaller-scale
matrix trace norm minimization. Finally, we develop two parallel alternating
direction methods of multipliers (ADMM) to solve our problems. Experimental
results verify that our regularized formulation is effective, and our methods
are robust to noise or outliers.

a deformation of the Coulomb problem with coupling constant $k$, that it is
smoothly recovered in the limit $\eta\to 0$. Moreover, the kinetic energy term
in $H$ is just the one corresponding to an $N$-dimensional Taub-NUT space, a
fact that makes this system relevant from a geometric viewpoint. Since the

manifold and a multiple of its scalar curvature. As a consequence, we obtain a
novel exactly solvable deformation of the quantum Coulomb problem, whose
spectrum is computed in closed form for positive values of $\eta$ and $k$, and
showing that the well-known maximal degeneracy of the flat system is preserved

wireless content distribution by mitigating the wireless traffic rate during
the peak-traffic time, where the contents are partially prefetched to the local
cache of mobile devices during the off-peak time. The remaining contents are
then jointly coded and delivered in multicast, when many content requests are
initiated in the peak-traffic time. The requested contents can be recovered
from the local-prefetched and multicast data with requesters experiencing less
congestions. However, the benefit of the coded caching scheme is still under
estimated, where the potential gain by appropriate caching distribution is
under exploited. In this paper, we propose a theoretical model to minimize the
average wireless traffic rate required in the coded caching, for which the
optimized caching distribution is derived with the content popularity
distribution taken into account. In order to improve the computational
efficiency for determining the appropriate caching distribution, we transform
the objective function from the average wireless traffic rate into the average
size of un-prefetched contents. We theoretically show the order optimality of
the derived results from both the primal model and the relaxed one. Simulation
results show that the coded caching performance can be further improved with

luminosities. This, together with the availability of new full evolutionary
white dwarf models that are reliable at high luminosities, have opened the
possibility of testing particle emission in the core of very hot white dwarfs,
where neutrino processes are dominant. We use the available WDLFs from the
Sloan Digital Sky Survey and the SuperCOSMOS Sky Survey to constrain the value
of the neutrino magnetic dipole moment ($\mu_\nu$). We constructed theoretical
WDLFs for different values of $\mu_\nu$ and performed a $\chi^2$-test to derive
constraints on the value of $\mu_\nu$. We also constructed a unified WDLF by
averaging the SDSS and SSS and estimated the uncertainties by taking into
account the differences between the WDLF at each magnitude bin. Then we
compared all WDLFs with theoretical WDLFs.Comparison between theoretical WDLFs
and both the SDSS and the averaged WDLF indicates that $\mu_\nu$ should be
$\mu_\nu<5\times 10^{-12}\, e\hbar/(2m_e c)$. In particular, a $\chi^2$-test on
the averaged WDLF suggests that observations of the disk WDLF exclude values of
$\mu_\nu>5\times 10^{-12}e\hbar/(2m_e c)$ at more than a 95\% confidence level,
even when conservative estimates of the uncertainties are adopted. Our study
shows that modern WDLFs, which extend to the high-luminosity regime, are an
excellent tool for constraining the emission of particles in the core of hot
white dwarfs. However, discrepancies between different WDLFs suggest there
might be some relevant unaccounted systematic errors. A larger set of
completely independent WDLFs, as well as more detailed studies of the
theoretical WDLFs and their own uncertainties, is desirable to explore the
systematic uncertainties behind this constraint.

polarisation-dependent Raman spectra, we show that the anomalous features in
the multi-order scattering could be the sidebands on the low-energy mode at
about 25 cm-1. We suggest that this low-energy mode stems from the tunneling
transition between the potential energy minima arising near the Jahn-Teller
Mn3+ ion due to the lattice anharmonicity, and the multi-order scattering is
activated by this low-energy electronic motion. The sidebands are dominated by
the oxygen contribution to the phonon density-of-states, however, there is an
admixture of an additional component, which may arise from coupling between the
low-energy electronic motion and the vibrational modes.

(2) Once a seed condensation is formed, it can grow via siphon flow
spontaneously even if the evaporation stops; (3) A scaling law was obtained to
relate the length of the prominence thread to various parameters, indicating
that higher prominences tend to have shorter threads, which is consistent with
the fact that threads are long in active region prominences and short in
quiescent prominences; (4) It was proposed that long-time prominence
