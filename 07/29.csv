(MANETs) where nodes belong to different authorities. Since cooperation of
nodes is essential for routing protocols, various methods have been proposed to
stimulate cooperation among selfish nodes. In order to provide sufficient
incentives, most of these methods pay nodes a premium over their actual costs
of participation. However, they lead to considerably large overpayments.
Moreover, existing methods ignore mobility of nodes, for simplicity. However,
owing to the mobile nature of MANETs, this assumption seems unrealistic. In
this paper, we propose an optimal game theoretical framework to ensure the
proper cooperation in mobility aware routing for MANETs. The proposed method is
based on the multi-dimensional optimal auctions which allows us to consider
path durations, in addition to the route costs. Path duration is a metric that
best reflects changes in topology caused by mobility of nodes and, it is widely
used in mobility aware routing protocols. Furthermore, the proposed mechanism
is optimal in that it minimizes the total expected payments. We provide
theoretical analysis to support our claims. In addition, simulation results
show significant improvements in terms of payments compared to the most popular
existing methods.

In the high-scale
inflation scenario, the Peccei-Quinn (PQ) symmetry is likely to be restored

origin is smaller than its vacuum expectation value; for instance in a class of
SUSY axion models, thermal inflation happens before the radial component of the
PQ scalar (saxion) relaxes into the global minimum of the potential and the
decay of saxion coherent oscillation would produce too much axion dark
radiation. In this paper, we study how to avoid the overproduction of axion
dark radiation with some concrete examples. We show that, by taking account of
the finite-temperature dissipation effect appropriately, the overproduction
constraint can be relaxed since the PQ scalar can take part in the thermal
plasma again even after the PQ phase transition. We also show that it can be
further relaxed owing to the late time decay of another heavy CP-odd scalar, if

coherence protocols. In particular, we focus on a specific form of deadlock
which is useful for the cache coherence protocol domain and consistent with the
internal definition of deadlock in the Murphi model checker: we refer to this
deadlock as a system- wide deadlock (s-deadlock). In s-deadlock, the entire
system gets blocked and is unable to make any transition. Cache coherence
protocols consist of N symmetric cache agents, where N is an unbounded
parameter; thus the verification of s-deadlock freedom is naturally a
parameterized verification problem. Parametrized verification techniques work
by using sound abstractions to reduce the unbounded model to a bounded model.
Efficient abstractions which work well for industrial scale protocols typically
bound the model by replacing the state of most of the agents by an abstract
environment, while keeping just one or two agents as is. However, leveraging
such efficient abstractions becomes a challenge for s-deadlock: a violation of
s-deadlock is a state in which the transitions of all of the unbounded number
of agents cannot occur and so a simple abstraction like the one above will not
preserve this violation. In this work we address this challenge by presenting a
technique which leverages high-level information about the protocols, in the
form of message sequence dia- grams referred to as flows, for constructing
invariants that are collectively stronger than s-deadlock. Efficient
abstractions can be constructed to verify these invariants. We successfully
verify the German and Flash protocols using our technique.

First we consider an ideal case, perfect nanoribbons without any edge
deformation, and show that their electronic properties are strongly
size-dependent. We find that the narrow armchair AA-stacked BLGNRs (similar to
single-layer graphene nanoribbons) may be metallic or semiconducting depending
on their width determined by the number of dimer lines across the ribbon width,
while the wide ribbons are metallic. Then we show that, when the edge
deformation effects are taken into account, all narrow armchair AA-stacked
BLGNRs become semiconducting while the wide ribbons remain metallic. We also
investigate effects of an electric filed applied perpendicular to the
nanoribbon layers and show it can be used to tune the electronic properties of
these nanoribbons leading to a semiconducting-to-metallic phase transition at a
critical value of the electric field which depends on the nanoribbon width.
Furthermore, in all regimes, we calculate the corresponding wavefunctions which
can be used to investigate and predict various properties in these nanoribbons.

decades gave a valuable contribution to the comprehension of the role of the
fluid dynamics in the cardiac function and to support the interpretation of the
data obtained in vivo. Nevertheless, some questions are still open and new ones
stem from the continuous improvements in the diagnostic imaging techniques.
Many of these unresolved issues are related to the three-dimensional structure
of the left-ventricular flow during the cardiac cycle. In this paper we
investigated in detail this aspect using a laboratory model. The ventricle was
simulated by a flexible sack varying its volume in time according to a
physiologically shaped law. Velocities measured during several cycles on series
of parallel planes, taken from two orthogonal points of view, were combined
together in order to reconstruct the phase averaged, three-dimensional velocity
field. During the diastole, three main steps are recognized in the evolution of
the vortical structures: i) straight propagation in the direction of the long
axis of a vortex-ring originated from the mitral orifice; ii) asymmetric
development of the vortex-ring on an inclined plane; iii) single vortex
formation. The analysis of three-dimensional data gives the experimental
evidence of the reorganization of the flow in a single vortex persisting until
the end of the diastole. This flow pattern seems to optimize the cardiac
function since it directs velocity towards the aortic valve just before the
systole and minimizes the fraction of blood residing within the ventricle for
more cycles.

also shown to hold for cost. This relationship becomes even more pronounced for
transitive amenable actions, leading to a simple criterion for vanishing of the

polarization signals can be seen in the region that connects them. The magnetic
structure inferred from the time series revealed that the structure corresponds
to a $\Omega$-loop, with one footpoint always over the edge of a granule and
the other inside an intergranular lane. The physical parameters obtained from
the inversions of the observed Stokes profiles in both events show an increase
with respect to the Harvard-Smithonian reference atmosphere in the temperature
at $\log\tau_{500} \in (-1, -3)$ and a strong magnetic field, $B \ge 1$ kG, at
the bottom of the atmosphere that quickly decreases upward until vanishing at
$\log\tau_{500} \approx -2$. In the blue-shifted events, the line of sight
velocities change from upflows at the bottom to downflows at the top of the
atmosphere. Red-shifted events display the opposite velocity stratification.
The change of sign in line of sight velocity happens at the same optical depth

explains the inferred magnetic field configuration and flow motions is a siphon
flow along an arched magnetic flux tube. Further investigation is required

between model protein and a ceramic implant surface in the aqueous solvent,
considered in the framework of the non-local electrostatic model, is calculated
as a function of the implant low-frequency dielectric constant. We show that
the existence of a dynamically ordered (low-dielectric) interfacial solvent
layer at the protein-solvent and ceramic-solvent interface markedly increases
charging energy of the protein and ceramic implant, and consequently makes the
electrostatic contribution to the protein-ceramic binding energy more favorable
(attractive). Our analysis shows that the corresponding electrostatic energy
between protein and oxide ceramics depends non-monotonically on the dielectric
constant of ceramic. Obtained results indicate that protein can attract
electrostatically to the surface if ceramic material has a moderate dielectric
constant below or about 35 (in particularly ZrO2 or Ta2O5). This is in contrast
to classical (local) consideration of the solvent, which demonstrates an
unfavorable electrostatic interaction of protein with typical metal oxide
ceramic materials (dielectric constant>10). Thus, a solid implant coated by
combining oxide ceramic with a reduced dielectric constant can be beneficial to
strengthen the electrostatic binding of the protein-implant complex.

parallel CUDA implementation of a worldline numerics algorithm. In the
worldline numerics technique, we wish to generate an ensemble of representative
closed-loop particle trajectories, and use these to compute an approximate
average value for Wilson loops. We show how this can be done with a specific
emphasis on cylindrically symmetric magnetic fields. The fine-grained, massive

computing Wilson loop averages. Furthermore, we give a brief overview of
uncertainty analysis in the worldline numerics method. There are uncertainties
from discretizing each loop, and from using a statistical ensemble of
representative loops. The former can be minimized so that the latter dominates.
However, determining the statistical uncertainties is complicated by two
subtleties. Firstly, the distributions generated by the worldline ensembles are
highly non-Gaussian, and so the standard error in the mean is not a good
measure of the statistical uncertainty. Secondly, because the same ensemble of
worldlines is used to compute the Wilson loops at different values of $T$ and
$x_\mathrm{ cm}$, the uncertainties associated with each computed value of the
integrand are strongly correlated. We recommend a form of jackknife analysis
which deals with both of these problems.

The symmetry reduction analysis of the experimental data reveals that the speed

phases of the corresponding orbits in the fiber bundle. In particular, in the
symmetry-reduced frame we unveil a pattern-changing dynamics of the passive

magnetic field is on the order the quantum critical field strength, $B_k =
\frac{m^2}{e} = 4.4 \times 10^{13}$ Gauss, the magnetic field is likely to vary
rapidly on the scales where \acs{QED} effects are important. In this paper, we
construct a cylindrically symmetric toy model of a flux tube lattice in which
the non-local influence of \acs{QED} on neighbouring flux tubes is taken into
account. We compute the effective action densities using the worldline numerics
technique. The numerics predict a greater effective energy density in the
region of the flux tube, but a smaller energy density in the regions between
the flux tubes compared to a locally-constant-field approximation. We also
compute the interaction energy between a flux tube and its neighbours as the
lattice spacing is reduced from infinity. Because our flux tubes exhibit
compact support, this energy is entirely non-local and predicted to be zero in
local approximations such as the derivative expansion. This Casimir-Polder
energy can take positive or negative values depending on the distance between
the flux tubes, and it may cause the flux tubes in neutron stars to form
bunches.

determining the statistical uncertainties within the worldline numerics

power-law photon spectrum C_nu ~ nu^{-2} and considering only the pairs
generated from primary high-energy photons. The essential properties of these
pairs (number, minimal energy, cooling energy, distribution with energy) and of
their emission (peak flux, spectral breaks, spectral slope) are set by the
observables GeV fluence Phi (t) = Ft and spectrum, and by the Lorentz factor
Gamma and magnetic field B of the source of high-energy photons, at
observer-time t. Optical and X-ray pseudo--light-curves F_nu (Gamma) are
calculated for given B; proper synchrotron self-Compton light-curves are
calculated by setting the dynamics Gamma(t) of the high-energy photons source
to be that of a decelerating, relativistic shock. It is found that the emission
from pairs can accommodate the flux and decays of the optical flashes measured
during the prompt (GRB) phase and of the faster-decaying X-ray plateaus
observed during the delayed (afterglow) phase. The brightest pair optical
emission is obtained for 100 < Gamma < 500, and depends mostly on the GeV
fluence, being independent of the source redshift. Emission from pairs formed
during the GRB phase offers an alternate explanation to reverse-shock optical
flashes. These two models may be distinguished based on their corresponding
flux decay index--spectral slope relations, different correlations with the LAT
fluence, or through modeling of the afterglow multiwavelength data.

existing text detection methods. This paper addresses the problem of text
segmentation in natural scenes from a hierarchical perspective. Contrary to
existing methods, we make explicit use of text structure, aiming directly to
the detection of region groupings corresponding to text within a hierarchy
produced by an agglomerative similarity clustering process over individual
regions. We propose an optimal way to construct such an hierarchy introducing a
feature space designed to produce text group hypotheses with high recall and a
novel stopping rule combining a discriminative classifier and a probabilistic
measure of group meaningfulness based in perceptual organization. Results
obtained over four standard datasets, covering text in variable orientations
and different languages, demonstrate that our algorithm, while being trained in
a single mixed dataset, outperforms state of the art methods in unconstrained

spacetime, dark energy can be induced by a U(1) scalar-gauge field on the
brane. We consider a zero effective cosmological constant, i.e., the
Randall-Sundrum(RS) fine-tuning and no bulk matter fields. The standard model
fields interact via the bulk Weyl tensor and cause brane fluctuations. Due to
the warp factor, disturbances don't fade away during the expansion of the
universe. The late-time behavior could be significant deviate from the standard
evolution of the universe. The effect is triggered by the time-dependent part
of the warp factor. The self-gravitating cosmic string builds up a huge mass
per unit length in the bulk and can induce massive KK-modes felt on the brane.
From a nonlinear perturbation analysis it is found that the effective Einstein
equations contain a ""back-reaction"" term on the righthand side caused by the
projected 5D Weyl tensor and can act as a dark energy term. The propagation
equations to first order for the metric components and scalar-gauge fields show
explicit $\varphi$-dependency.

regression with high-dimensional BIGDATA have found many applications in
bioinformatics, computational biology, image processing, and engineering. One
appealing approach is the L0 regularized regression which penalizes the number
of nonzero features in the model directly. L0 is known as the most essential
sparsity measure and has nice theoretical properties, while the popular L1
regularization is only a best convex relaxation of L0. Therefore, it is natural
to expect that L0 regularized regression performs better than LASSO. However,
it is well-known that L0 optimization is NP-hard and computationally
challenging. Instead of solving the L0 problems directly, most publications so
far have tried to solve an approximation problem that closely resembles L0
regularization.
  In this paper, we propose an efficient EM algorithm (L0EM) that directly
solves the L0 optimization problem. $L_0$EM is efficient with high dimensional
data. It also provides a natural solution to all Lp p in [0,2] problems. The
regularized parameter can be either determined through cross-validation or AIC
and BIC. Theoretical properties of the L0-regularized estimator are given under
mild conditions that permit the number of variables to be much larger than the
sample size. We demonstrate our methods through simulation and high-dimensional
genomic data. The results indicate that L0 has better performance than LASSO
and L0 with AIC or BIC has similar performance as computationally intensive
cross-validation. The proposed algorithms are efficient in identifying the
non-zero variables with less-bias and selecting biologically important genes
and pathways with high dimensional BIGDATA.

for the understanding of planet system formation and evolution. The bright and
well studied HAT-P-7 system is intriguing as several Rossiter-McLaughlin (RM)
measurements found a large projected obliquity in this system, but it was so
far not possible to determine if the orbit is polar and/or retrograde. The goal
of this study is to measure the stellar inclination and hereby the full 3D
obliquity of the HAT-P-7 system instead of only the 2D projection as measured
by the RM effect. In addition we provide an updated set of stellar parameters
for the star. We use the full set of available observations from Kepler
spanning Q0-Q17 to produce the power spectrum of HAT-P-7. We extract
oscillation mode frequencies via an MCMC peak-bagging routine, and use the
results from this to estimate the stellar inclination angle. Combining this
with the projected obliquity from RM and the inclination of the orbital plane
allows us to determine the stellar obliquity. We use asteroseismology to model
the star from the extracted frequencies using two different approaches to the
modelling where either the MESA or the GARSTEC stellar evolution codes are
adopted. Using our updated asteroseismic modelling we find, i.a., the following
stellar parameters for HAT-P-7: M=1.51{+0.04}{-0.05}Msun,
$R=2.00{+0.01}{-0.02}Rsun, and age = 2.07{+0.28}{-0.23} Gyr. Our asteroseismic
modelling offers a high precision on the stellar parameters, for instance is
the uncertainty on age of the order ~11%. For the stellar inclination we
estimate i_star<36.5 deg., which translates to an obliquity between 83 and 111
deg. We find that the planet HAT-P-7b is likely retrograde in its orbit, and
that the orbit is close to being polar. The new parameters for the star gives
an updated planetary density of 0.65+-0.03 g cm^{-3}, which is lower than
previous estimates.

we focused on a founder population with almost complete Mendelian disease
ascertainment and a known pedigree. By considering all recessive lethal

estimated that each haploid set of human autosomes carries on average 0.29 (95%

complete sterility or severe disorders at birth or before reproductive age when
homozygous. Comparison to existing estimates of the deleterious effects of all

with an extrapolation of the relation obtained from high mass clusters.
However, the fit to the Y_500-mass relation at low masses, while in good

\] Recently, G. Andrews and J. Sellers discovered congruences of the form $\xi
(p m + j) \equiv 0$ modulo $p$, valid for all $m \geq 0$. These congruences
have then been complemented and generalized to the case of $r$-Fishburn numbers
by F. Garvan. In this note, we answer a question of Andrews and Sellers
regarding an extension of these congruences to the case of prime powers. We
show that, under a certain condition, all these congruences indeed extend to

theory calculations, we show that the band gap of few layers of MoS$_2$ can be
tuned by applying i) normal compressive (NC), ii) biaxial compressive (BC), and
iii) biaxial tensile (BT) strain. A reversible semiconductor to metal
transition (S-M transition) is observed under all three types of strain. In the
case of NC strain, the threshold strain at which S-M transition occurs
increases with increasing number of layers and becomes maximum for the bulk. On
the other hand, the threshold strain for S-M transition in both BC and BT
strain decreases with the increase in number of layers. The difference in the
mechanisms for the S-M transition is explained for different types of applied
strain. Furthermore, the effect of strain type and number of layers on the
transport properties are also studied using Botzmann transport theory. We
optimize the transport properties as a function of number of layers and applied
strain. 3L- and 2L-MoS$_2$ emerge as the most efficient thermoelectric material
under NC and BT strain, respectively. The calculated thermopower is large and
comparable to some of the best thermoelectric materials. A comparison between

system is used to identify 44 clumpy disk galaxies, along with mass-matched
comparison samples of smooth and intermediate morphology galaxies. We note
that, despite being being mass-matched and having similar star formation rates,
the smoother galaxies tend to be smaller disks with more prominent bulges
compared to the clumpy galaxies. The lack of smooth extended disks is probably
a general feature of the z~2 galaxy population, and means we cannot directly
compare with the clumpy and smooth extended disks observed at lower redshift.
We find that z~2 clumpy galaxies have slightly enhanced AGN fractions selected
by integrated line ratios (in the mass-excitation method), but the spatially
resolved line ratios indicate this is likely due to extended phenomena rather
than nuclear AGNs. Meanwhile the X-ray data show that clumpy, smooth, and
intermediate galaxies have nearly indistinguishable AGN fractions derived from
both individual detections and stacked non-detections. The data demonstrate
that AGN fueling modes at z~1.85 - whether violent disk instabilities or
secular processes - are as efficient in smooth galaxies as they are in clumpy

stripping event gives rise to an extended gaseous tail, traced by our MUSE
observations to >30 kpc from the galaxy center. By studying the H-alpha surface
brightness and kinematics in tandem with the stellar velocity field, we
conclude that ram pressure has completely removed the interstellar medium from
the outer disk, while the primary tail is still fed by gas from the inner
regions. Gravitational interactions do not appear to be a primary mechanism for
gas removal. The stripped gas retains the imprint of the disk rotational
velocity to ~20 kpc downstream, without a significant gradient along the tail,
which suggests that ESO137-001 is fast moving along a radial orbit in the plane
of the sky. Conversely, beyond ~20 kpc, a greater degree of turbulence is seen,
with velocity dispersion up to >100 km/s. For a model-dependent infall velocity
of ~3000 km/s, we conclude that the transition from laminar to turbulent flow
in the tail occurs on timescales >6.5 Myr. Our work demonstrates the terrific
potential of MUSE for detailed studies of how ram-pressure stripping operates
on small scales, providing a deep understanding of how galaxies interact with

accretion models. Using 3D high-resolution simulations, we probe the impact of
rotation on the hot and cold accretion flow in a typical massive galaxy. In the
hot mode, with or without turbulence, the pressure-dominated flow forms a
geometrically thick rotational barrier, suppressing the accretion rate to ~1/3
of the Bondi rate. When radiative cooling is dominant, the gas loses pressure
support and quickly circularizes in a cold thin disk. In the more common state
of a turbulent and heated atmosphere, CCA drives the dynamics if the gas
velocity dispersion exceeds the rotational velocity, i.e., turbulent Taylor
number < 1. Extended multiphase filaments condense out of the hot phase via
thermal instability and rain toward the black hole, boosting the accretion rate
up to 100 times the Bondi rate. Initially, turbulence broadens the angular
momentum distribution of the hot gas, allowing the cold phase to condense with
prograde or retrograde motion. Subsequent chaotic collisions between the cold
filaments, clouds, and a clumpy variable torus promote the cancellation of
angular momentum, leading to high accretion rates. The simulated sub-Eddington
accretion rates cover the range inferred from AGN cavity observations. CCA
predicts inner flat X-ray temperature and $r^{-1}$ density profiles, as
recently discovered in M 87 and NGC 3115. The synthetic H{\alpha} images
reproduce the main features of cold gas observations in massive ellipticals, as
the line fluxes and the filaments versus disk morphology. Such dichotomy is key
for the long-term AGN feedback cycle. As gas cools, filamentary CCA develops
and boosts AGN heating; the cold mode is thus reduced and the rotating disk
remains the sole cold structure. Its consumption leaves the atmosphere in hot
mode with suppressed accretion and feedback, reloading the cycle.

velocities, column densities, and distances from the central quasar. We

aided by the first detection of PV $\lambda\lambda$1118,1128 BAL variability in
a quasar. In particular, PV absorption at velocities where the CIV trough does
not reach zero intensity implies that the CIV BAL is saturated and the absorber
only partially covers the background continuum source (with characteristic size
<0.01 pc). With the assumption of solar abundances, we estimate that the total
column density in the BAL outflow is log N_H > 22.3 (cm^-2). Variability in the
PV and saturated CIV BALs strongly disfavors changes in the ionization as the
cause of the BAL variability, but supports models with high-column density BAL
clouds moving across our lines of sight. The observed variability time of 1.6
yr in the quasar rest frame indicates crossing speeds >750 km/s and a radial
distance from the central black hole of <3.5 pc, if the crossing speeds are
Keplerian. The total outflow mass is ~4100 M_solar, the kinetic energy ~4x10^54

origin. Since specific sources have not yet been identified, we discuss what
could be learned from the conceptual point of view. We use a simple model for
neutrino production from the interactions between nuclei and matter, and we
focus on the description of the spectral shape and flavor composition observed
by IceCube. Our main parameters are spectral index, maximal energy, magnetic
field, and composition of the accelerated nuclei. We show that a cutoff at PeV
energies can be achieved by soft enough spectra, a cutoff of the primary
energy, or strong enough magnetic fields. These options, however, are difficult
to reconcile with the hypothesis that these neutrinos originate from the same
sources as the ultra-high energy cosmic rays. We demonstrate that heavier
nuclei accelerated in the sources may be a possible way out if the maximal
energy scales appropriately with the mass number of the nuclei. In this
scenario, neutrino observations can actually be used to test the UHECR
acceleration mechanism. We also emphasize the need for a volume upgrade of the
IceCube detector for future precision physics, for which the flavor information
becomes a statistical meaningful model discriminator as qualitatively new
ingredient.

agree within uncertainties with the Halpha luminosity inferred SFRs. The HII
region luminosity functions have standard slopes at the luminous end. The
global SFRs demonstrate that the HIghMass galaxies exhibit active ongoing star
formation (SF) with moderate SF efficiency, but relative to normal spirals, a
lower integrated SFR in the past. Because the SF activity in these systems is
spread throughout their extended disks, they have overall lower SFR surface
densities and lower surface brightness in the optical bands. Relative to normal
disk galaxies, the majority of HIghMass galaxies have higher Halpha equivalent
widths and are bluer in their outer disks, implying an inside-out disk growth
scenario. Downbending double exponential disks are more frequent than upbending
disks among the gas-rich galaxies, suggesting that SF thresholds exist in the
downbending disks, probably as a result of concentrated gas distribution.

employing improved, more realistic Pop III evolutionary stellar models. To
facilitate a meaningful comparison, we consider a fixed mass of 60 solar masses
(Msun) incorporated in Pop III stars, either contained in a single star, or
split up in binary stars of 30 Msun each or an asymmetric case of one 45 Msun
and one 15 Msun star. Whereas the sizes of the resulting HII regions are
comparable across all cases, the HeIII regions around binary stars are
significantly smaller than that of the single star. Consequently, the He$^{+}$
1640 angstrom recombination line is expected to become much weaker. Supernova
feedback exhibits great variety due to the uncertainty in possible explosion
pathways. If at least one of the component stars dies as a hypernova about ten
times more energetic than conventional core-collapse supernovae, the gas inside
the host minihalo is effectively blown out, chemically enriching the
intergalactic medium (IGM) to an average metallicity of $10^{-4}-10^{-3}$ solar
metallicity (Zsun), out to $\sim 2$ kpc. The single star, however, is more
likely to collapse into a black hole, accompanied by at most very weak
explosions. The effectiveness of early chemical enrichment would thus be
significantly reduced, in difference from the lower mass binary stars, where at
least one component is likely to contribute to heavy element production and
dispersal. Important new feedback physics is also introduced if close binaries
can form high-mass x-ray binaries, leading to the pre-heating and -ionization
of the IGM beyond the extent of the stellar HII regions.

where planets have not been detected. However, debris disks are often only
characterized by unresolved infrared excesses that resemble featureless
blackbodies, and the location of the emitting dust is uncertain due to a
degeneracy with the dust grain properties. Here we characterize the Spitzer IRS
spectra of 22 debris disks exhibiting 10 micron silicate emission features.
Such features arise from small warm dust grains, and their presence can
significantly constrain the orbital location of the emitting debris. We find
that these features can be explained by the presence of an additional dust
component in the terrestrial zones of the planetary systems, i.e. an
exozodiacal belt. Aside from possessing exozodiacal dust, these debris disks
are not particularly unique; their minimum grain sizes are consistent with the
blowout sizes of their systems, and their brightnesses are comparable to those
of featureless warm debris disks. These disks are in systems with a range of
ages, although the older systems with features are found only around A-type
stars. The features in young systems may be signatures of terrestrial planet
formation. Analyzing the spectra of unresolved debris disks with emission

lensing statistics by constructing realistic simulated weak-lensing maps using
raytracing techniques through N-body cosmological simulations. We construct
maps for different lensing quantities, covering a range of scales from a few
arcminutes to several degrees. The concordance $\Lambda$CDM model is compared
to different coupled dark energy models, described either by an exponential
scalar field potential (standard coupled dark energy scenario) or by a SUGRA
potential (bouncing model). We analyse several statistical quantities and our
results, with sources at low redshifts are largely consistent with previous
work on CMB lensing by Carbone et al., 2013. The most significant differences
from the $\Lambda$CDM model are due to the enhanced growth of the perturbations
and to the effective friction term in non-linear dynamics. For the most extreme
models, we see differences in the power spectra up to 40% compared to the
$\Lambda$CDM model. The different time evolution of the linear matter
overdensity can account for most of the differences, but when controlling for
this using a $\Lambda$CDM model having the same normalization, the overall
signal is smaller due to the effect of the friction term appearing in the
equation of motion for dark matter particles.

diverse users and purposes. Their telescopes, instruments, software, and human
resources engage in interwoven workflows over a broad range of timescales.
These workflows have been tuned to be responsive to concepts of observatory
operations that were applicable when various assets were commissioned, years or
decades in the past. The astronomical community is entering an era of rapid
change increasingly characterized by large time domain surveys, robotic
telescopes and automated infrastructures, and - most significantly - of
operating modes and scientific consortia that span our individual facilities,
joining them into complex network entities.
  Observatories must adapt and numerous initiatives are in progress that focus
on redesigning individual components out of the astronomical toolkit. New
instrumentation is both more capable and more complex than ever, and even
simple instruments may have powerful observation scripting capabilities. Remote
and queue observing modes are now widespread. Data archives are becoming
ubiquitous. Virtual observatory standards and protocols and astroinformatics
data-mining techniques layered on these are areas of active development.
Indeed, new large-aperture ground-based telescopes may be as expensive as space
missions and have similarly formal project management processes and large data
management requirements.
  This piecewise approach is not enough. Whatever challenges of funding or
politics facing the national and international astronomical communities it will
be more efficient - scientifically as well as in the usual figures of merit of
cost, schedule, performance, and risks - to explicitly address the systems
engineering of the astronomical community as a whole.

pattern recognition. The problem is also known under different names, such as
outlier and novelty/anomaly detection. The core of the problem consists in
modeling and recognizing patterns belonging only to a so-called target class.
All other patterns are termed non-target, and therefore they should be
recognized as such. In this paper, we propose a novel one-class classification
system that is based on an interplay of different techniques. Primarily, we
follow a dissimilarity representation based approach; we embed the input data
into the dissimilarity space by means of an appropriate parametric
dissimilarity measure. This step allows us to process virtually any type of
data. The dissimilarity vectors are then represented through a weighted
Euclidean graphs, which we use to (i) determine the entropy of the data
distribution in the dissimilarity space, and at the same time (ii) derive
effective decision regions that are modeled as clusters of vertices. Since the
dissimilarity measure for the input data is parametric, we optimize its
parameters by means of a global optimization scheme, which considers both
mesoscopic and structural characteristics of the data represented through the
graphs. The proposed one-class classifier is designed to provide both hard
(Boolean) and soft decisions about the recognition of test patterns, allowing
an accurate description of the classification process. We evaluate the
performance of the system on different benchmarking datasets, containing either
feature-based or structured patterns. Experimental results demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed technique.

a target may inform the design of experiments. With observational gene
expression data, many methods discover causal variables by measuring each
variable's degree of statistical dependence with the target using dependence
measures (DMs). However, other methods measure each variable's ability to
explain the statistical dependence between the target and the remaining
variables in the data using conditional dependence measures (CDMs), since this
strategy is guaranteed to find the target's direct causes, direct effects, and
direct causes of the direct effects in the infinite sample limit. In this
paper, we design a new algorithm in order to systematically compare the
relative abilities of DMs and CDMs in discovering causal variables from gene
expression data.
  Results: The proposed algorithm using a CDM is sample efficient, since it
consistently outperforms other state-of-the-art local causal discovery
algorithms when samples sizes are small. However, the proposed algorithm using
a CDM outperforms the proposed algorithm using a DM only when sample sizes are
above several hundred. These results suggest that accurate causal discovery
from gene expression data using current CDM-based algorithms requires datasets
with at least several hundred samples.

total energy is not conserved in the driven system, the continuity equation
includes the source terms which are shown to represent the Joule heating
effects. For short times and weak drivings the energy current agrees with the
linear response theory. For stronger fields or longer times of driving the
system enters the quasiequilibrium regime when the energy current gradually
diminishes due to the heating effects. Finally, for even stronger driving the
energy current is shown to undergo a damped Bloch oscillations. The energy
spread also increases upon driving. However, the time--dependence of this

$\eta/s$ in bosonic and fermionic superfluids. A small $\eta/s$ is associated
with nearly perfect fluidity, and more general measures of the fluidity
perfection/imperfection are of wide interest to a number of communities. We use
a Kubo approach to concretely address this ratio via low temperature transport
associated with the quasi-particles. Our analysis for bosonic superfluids
utilizes the framework of the one-loop Bogoliubov approximation, whereas for
fermionic superfluids we apply BCS theory and its BCS-BEC extension.
Interestingly, we find that the transport properties of strict BCS and
Bogoliubov superfluids have very similar structures, albeit with different
quasi-particle dispersion relations. While there is a dramatic contrast between
the power law and exponential temperature dependence for $\eta$ alone, the
ratio $\eta/s$ for both systems is more similar. Specifically we find the same
linear dependence (on the ratio of temperature $T$ to inverse lifetime
$\gamma(T)$) with $\eta/s \propto T/\gamma(T)$, corresponding to imperfect
fluidity. By contrast, near the unitary limit of BCS-BEC superfluids a very

for the minimization of a convex composite objective function. The method uses
(approximate) partial second-order (curvature) information, so that the
algorithm performance is more robust when applied to highly nonseparable or ill
conditioned problems. We call the method Robust Coordinate Descent (RCD). At
each iteration of RCD, a block of coordinates is sampled randomly, a quadratic
model is formed about that block and the model is minimized
approximately/inexactly to determine the search direction. An inexpensive line
search is then employed to ensure a monotonic decrease in the objective
function and acceptance of large step sizes. We prove global convergence of the
RCD algorithm, and we also present several results on the local convergence of
RCD for strongly convex functions. Finally, we present numerical results on
large-scale problems to demonstrate the practical performance of the method.

excess at $m(\bar{D}^0 K^-) \approx 2.86 {\rm GeV}/c^2$ is found to be an
admixture of spin-1 and spin-3 resonances. Therefore the $D^*_{sJ}(2860)^-$
state previously observed in inclusive $e^+e^- \rightarrow \bar{D}^0 K^- X$ and
$pp \rightarrow \bar{D}^0 K^- X$ processes consists of at least two particles.
This is the first observation of a heavy flavoured spin-3 resonance, and the
first time that any spin-3 particle has been seen to be produced in $B$ decays.
The masses and widths of the new states and of the $D^*_{s2}(2573)^-$ meson are
measured, giving the most precise determinations to date.

a quantum state to be moved between different physical systems for storage and
retrieval or state manipulation. However, these state-transfer protocols suffer
from dephasing and dissipation. In this thesis we go beyond the standard
open-systems treatment of quantum dissipation allowing us to consider
non-Markovian environments. We use adiabatic perturbation theory in order to
give analytic descriptions for various quantum state-transfer protocols. The
leading-order corrections will give rise to additional terms adding to the
geometric phase preventing us from achieving a perfect fidelity. We obtain
analytical descriptions for the effects of the geometric phase in non-Markovian
regimes. The Markovian regime is usually treated by solving a standard
Bloch-Redfield master equation, while in the non-Markovian regime, we perform a
secular approximation allowing us to obtain a solution to the density matrix
without solving master equations. This solution contains all the relevant phase
information for our state-transfer protocol. After developing the general
theoretical tools, we apply our methods to adiabatic state transfer between a
four-level atom in a driven cavity. We explicitly consider dephasing effects
due to unavoidable photon shot noise and give a protocol for performing a phase
gate. These results will be useful to ongoing experiments in circuit quantum
electrodynamics (QED) systems.

parameter, we predict the rotation curves of twenty-three (23) galaxies

knowledge of both the gravitational potential from luminous mass of the
emitting galaxy and the receiving galaxy, and so each emitter galaxy is
compared to four (4) different Milky Way luminous mass models. On average in
this sample, the LCM is more successful than either dark matter or modified
gravity models in fitting the observed rotation curve data.

tasks. Different features can have different value ranges and some form of a
feature scaling is often required in order to learn an accurate classifier.
However, feature scaling is conducted as a preprocessing task prior to
learning. This is problematic in an online setting because of two reasons.
First, it might not be possible to accurately determine the value range of a
feature at the initial stages of learning when we have observed only a few
number of training instances. Second, the distribution of data can change over
the time, which render obsolete any feature scaling that we perform in a
pre-processing step. We propose a simple but an effective method to dynamically
scale features at train time, thereby quickly adapting to any changes in the
data stream. We compare the proposed dynamic feature scaling method against
more complex methods for estimating scaling parameters using several benchmark
datasets for binary classification. Our proposed feature scaling method
consistently outperforms more complex methods on all of the benchmark datasets
and improves classification accuracy of a state-of-the-art online binary
classifier algorithm.

emission is partially confined by the optical shell. We suggest that the
observed X-ray emission is caused by shock-heated gas, inside of the optical
shells. We also obtained X-ray luminosities which exceed the values predicted
by the standard analytical model. This fact shows that, in addition to the
winds of the interior stars, it is necessary to consider another ingredient in
the description, such as a supernova explosion, as has been proposed in

that they individually cannot afford to buy are commonly observed in markets.
For example in the US market for radio spectrum, a recent proposal invited
small firms who would benefit from gaining additional access to spectrum to
jointly submit bids for blocks of spectrum with the idea that its utilization
could be shared. In such a scenario, the problem is to design a mechanism that
truthfully elicits and aggregates the privately held preferences of these
agents, and enables them to act as a single decision-making body in order to
participate in the market. In this paper, we design a class of mechanisms
called monotonic aggregation mechanisms that achieves this under a specific
setting. We assume that the resource is being sold in a sealed-bid second-price
auction that solicits bids for the entire resource. Our mechanism truthfully
elicits utility functions from the buyers, prescribes a joint bid, and
prescribes a division of the payment and the resource in the event that they
win the resource in the auction. This mechanism further satisfies a popular
notion of collusion-resistance known as coalition-strategyproofness. We give
two explicit examples of this generic class for the case where the utility
functions of the buyers are non-decreasing and concave.

abundance of red giant branch stars that in a colour magnitude diagram populate
the region between the completion of the first dredge-up and the red giant
branch bump. We obtained high-resolution spectra with the FLAMES facility at
the Very Large Telescope for a sample of red giants in the globular cluster
M54, belonging to the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy. We obtain A(Li)=+0.93+-0.11
dex, translating -- after taking into account the dilution due to the dredge
up-- to initial abundances (A(Li)_0) in the range 2.35--2.29 dex, depending on
whether or not atomic diffusion is considered. This is the first measurement of
Li in the Sagittarius galaxy and the more distant estimate of A(Li)_0 in old
stars obtained so far. The A(Li)_0 estimated in M54 is lower by ~0.35 dex than
A(Li)_{BBN}, hence incompatible at a level of ~3sigma. Our result shows that
this discrepancy is a universal problem concerning both the Milky Way and

combination of atomic diffusion plus a suitably tuned additional mixing during

$2^t$-ary modular exponentiation for a classical RSA digital signature (i.e.,
RSA without the Chinese remainder theorem) is proposed. The $2^t$-ary method is
the most popular and widely used algorithm to speed up the RSA signature
process. Developers can realize the fastest signature process by choosing
optimum $t$. For example, $t=6$ is optimum for a 1536-bit classical RSA
implementation. The $2^t$-ary method requires precomputation to generate small
exponentials of message. Conventional fault attack research has paid little
attention to precomputation, even though precomputation could be a target of a
fault attack. The proposed DCA induces faults in precomputation by using
instruction skip technique, which is equivalent to replacing an instruction
with a no operation in assembly language. This paper also presents a useful
""position checker"" tool to determine the position of the $2^t$-ary coefficients
of the secret exponent from signatures based on faulted precomputations. The
DCA is demonstrated to be an effective attack method for some widely used
parameters. DCA can reconstruct an entire secret exponent using the position
checker with $63(=2^6-1)$ faulted signatures in a short time for a 1536-bit RSA
implementation using the $2^6$-ary method. The DCA process can be accelerated

model for these mechanical displacements as arising from the driving of surface
wave modes in which potential energy is stored in elastic properties of the
neuronal membrane and cytoskeleton while kinetic energy is carried by the
axoplasmic fluid. In our model these surface waves are driven by the traveling
wave of electrical depolarization that characterizes the AP, altering the
compressive electrostatic forces across the membrane as it passes. This driving
leads to co-propagating mechanical displacements, which we term Action Waves
(AWs). Our model for these AWs allows us to predict, in terms of elastic
constants, axon radius and axoplasmic density and viscosity, the shape of the
AW that should accompany any traveling wave of voltage, including the AP
predicted by the Hodgkin and Huxley (HH) equations. We show that our model
makes predictions that are in agreement with results in experimental systems

periodic arrays, making them of interest for photovoltaic applications. An
inevitable property of aperiodic arrays is the clustering of some NWs into
closer proximity than in the equivalent periodic array. We focus on the modes
of such clusters and show that the reduced symmetry associated with cluster
formation allows external coupling into modes which are dark in periodic
arrays, thus increasing absorption. To exploit such modes fully, arrays must
include tightly clustered NWs that are unlikely to arise from fabrication
variations but must be created intentionally.

high-speed operation, because of the strong coupling of electric fields to the
electron. However, charge noise also couples strongly to this qubit, resulting
in rapid dephasing at nearly all operating points, with the exception of one
special 'sweet spot'. Fast dc voltage pulses have been used to manipulate
semiconductor charge qubits, but these previous experiments did not achieve
high-fidelity control, because dc gating requires excursions away from the
sweet spot. Here, by using resonant ac microwave driving, we achieve coherent
manipulation of a semiconductor charge qubit, demonstrating a Rabi frequency of
up to 2GHz, a value approaching the intrinsic qubit frequency of 4.5GHz. Z-axis
rotations of the qubit are well-protected at the sweet spot, and by using ac
gating, we demonstrate the same protection for rotations about arbitrary axes
in the X-Y plane of the qubit Bloch sphere. We characterize operations on the
qubit using two independent tomographic approaches: standard process tomography
and a newly developed method known as gate set tomography. Both approaches show
that this qubit can be operated with process fidelities greater than 86% with

emission of which is dominated by a relativistic jet closely aligned with the
line of sight. This implies the existence of a parent population of sources
with a misaligned jet, that have been identified with low-power radiogalaxies.
The spectrum of BL Lacs, dominated by non-thermal emission over the whole
electromagnetic range, together with bright compact radio cores, high
luminosities, rapid and large amplitude flux variability at all frequencies and
strong polarization make these sources an optimal laboratory for high energy
astrophysics. A most distinctive characteristic of the class is the weakness or
absence of spectral lines, that historically hindered the identification of
their nature and ever thereafter proved to be a hurdle in the determination of
their distance. In this paper we review the main observational facts that
contribute to the present basic interpretation of this class of active
galaxies. We overview the history of the BL Lac objects research field and
their population as it emerged from multi-wavelength surveys. The properties of
the flux variability and polarization, compared with those at radio, X-ray and
gamma-ray frequencies, are summarized together with the present knowledge of
the host galaxies, their environments, and central black hole masses. We focus
this review on the optical observations, that played a crucial role in the
early phase of BL Lacs studies, and, in spite of extensive radio, X-ray, and
recently gamma-ray observations, could represent the future major contribution
to the unveiling of the origin of these sources. In particular they could
provide a firm conclusion on the long debated issue of the cosmic evolution of
this class of active galactic nuclei and on the connection between formation of
supermassive black holes and relativistic jets.

Fabry-Perot etalons working in tandem as a filter. This filter can be tuned to
different wavelengths by changing either voltage, tilt or temperature of the
etalons. To characterize the etalons, a Littrow spectrograph was set up, in
conjunction with a 15 cm Carl Zeiss Coud\'e solar telescope. The etalons were
calibrated for the solar spectral lines FeI 6173 {\AA}, and CaII 8542 {\AA}. In
this work, we discuss the characterization of the Fabry-Perot etalons,
specifically the temperature and voltage tuning of the system for the spectral
lines proposed for observations. We present the details of the calibration

crowdsourceable Quality of Experience (QoE) and has attracted much attention in
recent years. In QoE for multimedia, outliers happen because of different test
conditions, human errors, abnormal variations in context, {etc}. In this paper,
we propose a simple yet effective algorithm for outlier detection and robust
QoE evaluation named iterative Least Trimmed Squares (iLTS). The algorithm
assigns binary weights to samples, i.e., 0 or 1 indicating if a sample is an
outlier, then the outlier-trimmed subset least squares solutions give robust
ranking scores. An iterative optimization is carried alternatively between
updating weights and ranking scores which converges to a local optimizer in
finite steps. In our test setting, iLTS is up to 190 times faster than
LASSO-based methods with a comparable performance. Moreover, a varied version
of this method shows adaptation in outlier detection, which provides an
automatic detection to determine whether a data sample is an outlier without
\emph{a priori} knowledge about the amount of the outliers. The effectiveness
and efficiency of iLTS are demonstrated on both simulated examples and
real-world applications. A Matlab package is provided to researchers exploiting
crowdsourcing paired comparison data for robust ranking.

To characterize the complexity of the supersymmetric multiplex using quantum

to the layers of multiplex networks. Interestingly we observe a very simple
relation between the entanglement entropies of the layers of the supersymmetric

hadronic decays $B \to M_1 M_2$ in the $k_T$ factorization theorem, where $M_2$
denotes the meson emitted at the weak vertex. Employing the eikonal
approximation, the divergences are factorized into the corresponding Glauber
phase factors associated with the $M_1$ and $M_2$ mesons. It is observed that
the latter factor enhances the spectator contribution to the color-suppressed
tree amplitude by modifying the interference pattern between the two involved
leading-order diagrams. The first factor rotates the enhanced spectator
contribution by a phase, and changes its interference with other tree diagrams.
The above Glauber effects are compared with the mechanism in elastic
rescattering among various $M_1 M_2$ final states, which has been widely
investigated in the literature. We postulate that only the Glauber effect
associated with a pion is significant, due to its special role as a $q \bar q$
bound state and as a pseudo Nambu-Goldstone boson simultaneously. Treating the
Glauber phases as additional inputs in the perturbative QCD (PQCD) approach, we
find a good fit to all the $B \to \pi\pi$, $\pi\rho$, $\pi\omega$, and $\pi K$

state, the fermionic two-particle vertex develops rich and singular dependences
on momentum and frequency, for which an efficient parametrization in terms of
boson-exchange interactions in the particle-hole and particle-particle channels
is formulated. Based on this decomposition of the vertex, flow equations for
the effective interactions are derived, extending existing
channel-decomposition schemes to i) the description of symmetry breaking in the
Cooper channel and ii) the inclusion of those two-loop renormalization
contributions to the vertex that are neglected in the Katanin scheme. In the
second part of this thesis, the superfluid ground state of various model
systems is studied. For the attractive Hubbard model at weak coupling, the
momentum and frequency dependence of the two-particle vertex and the frequency
dependence of the self-energy are determined on one- and two-loop level.
Results for the suppression of the superfluid gap by fluctuations are in good
agreement with the literature. The two-loop approximation captures the singular
infrared behaviour that is expected in a fermionic superfluid at zero
temperature. For the repulsive Hubbard model at weak coupling, the momentum
dependence of the two-particle vertex and the d-wave superfluid gap are
determined on one-loop level as a function of the interaction, the next-nearest
neighbour hopping and the fermionic density. The results for the critical
scales and superfluid gaps are in qualitative agreement with the literature and
suggest the existence of an optimal value of the next-nearest neighbour hopping

is studied in two and three dimensions. The main goal is to compare and
contrast the phase separation in two and three dimensions, using
high-resolution numerical simulation as the basis for the study. The model flow
is parametrized by its amplitudes (thereby admitting the possibility of
anisotropy), lengthscales, and multiple time scales, and the outcome of the
phase separation is investigated as a function of these parameters as well as
the dimensionality. In this way, a parameter regime is identified wherein the
phase separation and the associated coarsening phenomenon are not only arrested
but in fact the concentration variance decays, thereby opening up the
possibility of describing the dynamics of the concentration field using the
theories of advection diffusion. This parameter regime corresponds to long flow
correlation times, large flow amplitudes and small diffusivities. The onset of
this hyperdiffusive regime is interpreted by introducing Batchelor
lengthscales. A key result is that in the hyperdiffusive regime, the
distribution of concentration (in particular, the frequency of extreme values
of concentration) depends strongly on the dimensionality. Anisotropic scenarios
are also investigated: for scenarios wherein the variance saturates
(corresponding to coarsening arrest), the direction in which the domains align
depends on the flow correlation time. Thus, for correlation times comparable to
the inverse of the mean shear rate, the domains align in the direction of
maximum flow amplitude, while for short correlation times, the domains
initially align in the opposite direction. However, at very late times (after
the passage of thousands of correlation times), the fate of the domains is the

the improvements on battery technology. Adaptive systems can help to balance
the demand of applications with the limitations of battery resources. For
effective systems, the influence of multimedia quality on power consumption of
the components of mobile devices needs to be better understood. In this paper,
we analyze the impact of video quality and wireless network type on the energy
consumption of a mobile device. We have found that the additional power
consumption is up to 38% higher when a movie is played over a WiFi network
instead from internal memory and 64% higher in case of a mobile network (3G).
We have also discovered that a higher movie quality not only affects the power
consumption of the CPU but also the power consumption of the WiFi unit by up to
58% and up to 72% respectively on mobile networks.

through binary-star interactions and include some of the most
chemically-peculiar stars in the Galaxy. Stellar evolution theory suggests that
they should have helium-rich atmospheres but, because radiation causes hydrogen
to diffuse upwards, a majority are extremely helium poor. Questions posed
include: when does the atmosphere become chemically stratified and at what
rate?
  The existence of several helium-rich subdwarfs suggests further questions;
are there distinct subgroups of hot subdwarf, or do hot subdwarfs change their
surface composition in the course of evolution? Recent analyses have revealed
remarkable surface chemistries amongst the helium-rich subgroup. In this paper,
we analyse high-resolution spectra of nine intermediate helium-rich hot
subdwarfs. We report the discovery that two stars, HE 2359-2844 and HE
1256-2738, show an atmospheric abundance of lead which is nearly ten thousand
times that seen in the Sun. This is measured from optical Pb IV absorption
lines never previously seen in any star. The lead abundance is ten to 100 times
that measured in normal hot subdwarf atmospheres from ultraviolet spectroscopy.
HE 2359-2844 also shows zirconium and yttrium abundances similar to those in
the zirconium star LS IV-14 116. The new discoveries are interpreted in terms
of heavily stratified atmospheres and the general picture of a surface
chemistry in transition from a new-born helium-rich subdwarf to a normal
helium-poor subdwarf.

resolution would be enormously beneficial to structural biology. X-ray
free-electron lasers generate highly intense and ultrashort x-ray pulses,
providing a route towards imaging of single molecules with atomic resolution.
The information on molecular structure is encoded in the coherent x-ray
scattering signal. In contrast to crystallography there are no Bragg
reflections in single molecule imaging, which means the coherent scattering is
not enhanced. Consequently, a background signal from incoherent scattering
deteriorates the quality of the coherent scattering signal. This background
signal cannot be easily eliminated because the spectrum of incoherently
scattered photons cannot be resolved by usual scattering detectors. We present
an ab initio study of incoherent x-ray scattering from individual carbon atoms,
including the electronic radiation damage caused by a highly intense x-ray
pulse. We find that the coherent scattering pattern suffers from a significant
incoherent background signal at high resolution. For high x-ray fluence the
background signal becomes even dominating. Finally, based on the atomic
scattering patterns, we present an estimation for the average photon count in
single molecule imaging at high resolution. By varying the photon energy from
3.5 keV to 15 keV, we find that imaging at higher photon energies may improve
the coherent scattering signal quality.

  The aim of GRAPHITE is to foster the convergence on research interests from
several communities dealing with graph analysis in all its forms in computer
science, with a particular attention to software development and analysis.
Graphs are used to represent data and processes in many application areas, and
they are subjected to various computational algorithms in order to analyze
them. Just restricting the attention to the analysis of software, graph
analysis algorithms are used, for instance, to verify properties using model
checking techniques that explore the system's state space graph or static
analysis techniques based on control flow graphs. Further application domains
include games, planning, and network analysis. Very often, graph problems and
their algorithmic solutions have common characteristics, independent of their
application domain. The goal of this event is to gather scientists from
different communities, who do research on graph analysis algorithms, such that
awareness of each others' work is increased. More information can be found at

population had to be significantly larger than the masses of the two planets,
and that the two planets must have built-up farther away than their present
location, at a distance of at least a few au from the central star. The planets
had to grow fast enough so that they would detach themselves from the
population of remaining, less massive, cores and migrate in to their present
location. By the time the other cores migrated in, the disc's inner edge would
have moved out so that these cores cannot be detected today. We also compute
the critical core mass beyond which a massive gaseous envelope would be
accreted and show that it is larger than 17 Earth masses if the planetesimal
accretion rate onto the core is larger than 10^{-6} Earth mass per year. For a
planetesimal accretion rate between 10^{-6} and 10^{-5} Earth mass per year,
the 17 Earth mass core would not be expected to have accreted more than about 1

leading to certain values of the pitch angles, thus to an efficient synchrotron

the use of signal priors such as sparsity. If NMF has now been well studied
with sparse constraints in the direct domain, only very few algorithms can
encompass non-negativity together with sparsity in a transformed domain since
simultaneously dealing with two priors in two different domains is challenging.
In this article, we show how a sparse NMF algorithm coined non-negative

non-negativity in the direct domain along with sparsity in a transformed
domain, with both analysis and synthesis formulations. To our knowledge, this

Comparisons with state-of-the-art NMF algorithms on realistic data show the

single field natural inflation in light of recent cosmological experiments,
BICEP2. Our main goal is to construct an inflationary model which not only
predicts the important cosmological quantities such as $(n_s, r)$ compatible
with experimental observation, but also is consistent with the low energy
effective theory framework. Therefore, all the fundamental scale apart from
$M_p$ and quantities of our interest should be within the sub-Planckian region.
In order to achieve our goal we modify the usual single field natural
inflationary model by a specific form of higher derivative kinetic term called
kinetic gravity braiding (KGB). One of our guiding principles to construct such
a model is the constant shift symmetry of the axion. We have chosen the form of
the KGB term in such a way that it predicts the required value of $n_s\simeq
0.96$ and a large tensor to scalar ratio $r> 0.1$. Importantly for a wide range
of parameter space our model has sub-Planckian axion decay constant $f$ and the
scale of inflation $\Lambda$. However, the reheating after the end of inflation
limits the value of $f$ so that we are unable to get $f$ to be significantly
lower than $M_p$. Furthermore, we find sub-Planckian field excursion for the
axion field $\Delta \phi \simeq f$ for the sufficient number of e-folding
${\cal N} \gtrsim 50 $. We also discussed in detail about the natural
preheating mechanism in our model based on the recently proposed Chern-Simon
coupling. We found this gravity mediated preheating is very difficult to
achieve in our model. With our general analytic argument, we also would like to
emphasize that Chern-Simons mediated preheating is very unlikely to happen in
any slow roll inflationary model.

published results while clustering in a 50-vacancy simulation box agrees with

mechanisms. In particular, we show that the path followed to reach a

Aggregation in a 50-vacancy box also shows a notable dispersion in relaxation
time associated with effective barriers varying from 0.84 to 1.1 eV depending
on the exact pathway selected. We isolate the effects of long-range elastic
interactions between defects by comparing to simulations where those effects
are deliberately suppressed. This allows us to demonstrate that in bcc Fe,
suppressing long-range interactions mainly influences kinetics in the first 0.3
ms, slowing down quick energy release cascades seen more frequently in full
simulations, whereas long-term behavior and final state are not significantly
affected.

various chemical element distributions on the surface of Alpha 2 CVn. With the
new magnetic field map and new chemical abundance distributions we can
investigate the interplay between the chemical abundance structures and the
magnetic field topology on the surface of Alpha 2 CVn.
  Previous attempts at chemical abundance mapping of Alpha 2 CVn relied on
lower resolution data. With our high resolution (R=65,000) dataset we present
nine chemical abundance maps for the elements O, Si, Cl, Ti, Cr, Fe, Pr, Nd and
Eu. We also derive an updated magnetic field map from Fe and Cr lines in Stokes
$IQUV$ and O and Cl in Stokes $IV$. These new maps are inferred from line
profiles in Stokes $IV$ using the magnetic Doppler imaging code Invers10. We
examine these new chemical maps and investigate correlations with the magnetic
topology of Alpha 2 CVn. We show that chemical abundance distributions vary
between elements, with two distinct groups of elements; one accumulates close
to the negative part of the radial field, whilst the other group shows higher
abundances located where the radial magnetic field is on the order of 2 kG
regardless of the polarity of the radial field component. We compare our
results with previous works which have mapped chemical abundance structures of
Ap stars. With the exception of Cr and Fe, we find no clear trend between what
we reconstruct and other mapping results. We also find a lack of agreement with
theoretical predictions. This suggests that there is a gap in our theoretical
understanding of the formation of horizontal chemical abundance structures and
the connection to the magnetic field in Ap stars.

set an upper limit on the surface brightness of ~2 x 10^30 erg arcmin^-2 s^-1,
at an assumed distance of 1.1 kpc. We found eight bright point sources in the
field, including the ROSAT source 1RXS J225203.8+574249 near the centre of the
radio shell. Spectroscopic analysis of some of the embedded point sources,
including the ROSAT source, has been performed, and all eight sources are most
likely ruled out as the associated neutron star, primarily due to counterpart
bright stars in optical and infrared bands. Timing analysis of the bright point
sources yielded no significant evidence for pulsations, but, due to the timing
resolution, only a small part of the frequency space could be searched. An
additional ten fainter point sources were identified in the vicinity of the
SNR. Further X-ray observation of these and the region in the vicinity of the
radio shell may be warranted.

explained by variations of the dust temperature in the accretion disk around
proto-binary star with at least one massive component. The dust temperature
variations are caused by rotation of hot and dense material of the spiral shock
wave in the disk central gap. The aim of this work is to show how different can
be the Class II methanol maser brightness in the disk during the Moment of
Maximum Illumination by the Spiral Shock material (hereafter MMISS) and the
Moment when the disk is Illuminated by the Stars Only (MISO). We used the code
CLOUDY (v13.02) to estimate physical conditions in the flat disk in the MISO
and the MMISS. Model physical parameters of the disk were then used to estimate
the brightness of 6.7, 9.9, 12.1 and 107 GHz masers at different impact
parameters $p$ using LVG approximation. It was shown that the strong masers
experience considerable brightness increase during the MMISS with respect to
MISO. There can happen both flares and dips of the 107 GHz maser brightness
under the MMISS conditions, depending on the properties of the system. The
brightest 9.9 GHz masers in the MMISS are situated at the greater $p$ than the
strong 6.7, 12.1 and 107 GHz masers that are situated at $p<200$ AU. The
brightness of 9.9 GHz maser in the MMISS suppressed at $p<200$ AU and increase
at $p>200$ AU.

Data were obtained using the CYCLOPS2 optical-fiber bundle and its simultaneous
calibration system feeding the UCLES spectrograph on the Anglo-Australian
Telescope. The sky-projected spin-orbit angle of $\lambda = 3\pm25^{\circ}$ was
determined from spectroscopic measurements of Rossiter-McLaughlin effect. This
is the first exoplanet discovered through the HATSouth transit survey to have
its spin-orbit angle measured. Our results indicate that the orbital plane of
HATS-3b is consistent with being aligned to the spin axis of its host star. The
low obliquity of the HATS-3 system, which has a relatively hot mid F-type host
star, agrees with the general trend observed for Hot Jupiter host stars with
effective temperatures $>6250$K to have randomly distributed spin-orbit angles.

systematically diffused around the exterior of a test body (tube) fully
submerged in a water tank. The primary purpose was to assess the feasibility of
applying micro cavitation as a means of depth control for underwater vehicles,
mainly but not limited to submarines. Ideally, the results would indicate the
use of micro cavitation as a more efficient alternative to underwater vehicle
depth control than the conventional ballast tank method. The current approach
utilizes the Archimedes' principle of buoyancy to alter the density of the
object affected, making it less than, or greater than the density of the
surrounding fluid. However, this process is too slow for underwater vehicles to
react to sudden obstacles inherent in their environment. Rather than altering
its internal density, this experiment aimed to investigate the response that
would occur if the density of its environment was manipulated instead. In
theory, and in a hydrostatic fluid, diffusing micro air bubbles from the top
surface of the submarine would dilute the column of water above it with air
cavities, thus lowering the density of the water. The resulting pressure
differential would then cause the submarine to gain buoyancy.

requires an electrical current flowing through the diamond sub-gap states for
the excitation of the colour centres. With this purpose, buried graphitic
electrodes with a spacing of 10 micrometers were fabricated in the bulk of a
detector-grade CVD single-crystal diamond sample using a scanning 1.8 MeV He
micro-beam. The current flowing in the gap region between the electrodes upon
the application of a 250 V bias voltage was exploited as the excitation pump
for the electroluminescence of different types of colour centres localized in
the above-mentioned gap. The bright light emission was spatially mapped using a
confocal optical microscopy setup. The spectral analysis of electroluminescence
revealed the emission from neutrally-charged nitrogen-vacancy centres ($NV^0$,
$\lambda_{ZPL}$ = 575 nm), as well as from cluster crystal dislocations
(A-band, {\lambda} = 400-500 nm). Moreover, an electroluminescence signal with
appealing spectral features (sharp emission at room temperature, low phonon
sidebands) from He-related defects was detected ($\lambda_{ZPL}$ = 536.3 nm,
$\lambda_{ZPL}$ = 560.5 nm); a low and broad peak around {\lambda} = 740 nm was
also observed and tentatively ascribed to Si-V or GR1 centres. These results
pose interesting future perspectives for the fabrication of
electrically-stimulated single-photon emitters in diamond for applications in
quantum optics and quantum cryptography.

By applying a canonical transformation, the introduced model is reduced to a

initial conditions which may be prepared for the atom and the field, the time
evolution of state vector of the entire system is analytically evaluated. Then,
the dynamics of atom is studied through the evolution of the atomic population

converging, in a large population asymptotic, towards the continuum random
tree. We extend this model to populations with random foundation times, with
(potentially improper) prior distributions g_i: x\mapsto x^{-i}, i\in\Z_+,
including the so-called uniform (i=0) and log-uniform (i=1) priors.

studying the site frequency spectrum of a sample with fixed size, i.e. the
number of mutations carried by k individuals in the sample. Explicit formulae
for the expected frequency spectrum of a sample are provided, in the cases of a
fixed foundation time, and of a uniform and log-uniform prior on the foundation
time. Second, we establish the convergence in distribution, for large sample

assets, one traded and one nontraded, we obtain a representation of the price
as the value function of an auxiliary simpler optimization problem under a risk
neutral probability, that can be viewed as a perturbation of the minimal
entropy martingale measure. Finally, numerical results are provided.

gained ground which highlight the role of the the binary relation of adiabatic
accessibility between equilibrium states. A feature of Carath\'eodory's system
is that the version therein of the second law contains an ambiguity about the
nature of irreversible adiabatic processes, making it weaker than the
traditional Kelvin-Planck statement of the law. This paper attempts first to
clarify the nature of this ambiguity, by defining the arrow of time in
thermodynamics by way of the Equilibrium Principle (""Minus First Law""). It then
argues that the ambiguity reappears in the important 1999 axiomatisation due to
Lieb and Yngvason.

with tunable Josephson energy $E_J$ embedded in an inductive environment

charge on the junction, which results in an enhancement of the zero-bias
resistance of the circuit. We understand this result quantitatively in terms of
the Bloch band dynamics of the localized charge. This dynamics is governed by
diffusion in the lowest Bloch band of the Josephson junction as well as by
Landau-Zener transitions out of the lowest band into the higher bands. In
addition, the frequencies corresponding to the self-resonant modes of the SQUID
array exceed the Josephson energy $E_J$ of the tunable junction, which results
in a renormalization of $E_J$, and, as a consequence, of the effective
bandwidth of the lowest Bloch band.

  Submitted",,,,"cs.SI math.PR physics.data-an physics.soc-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The quest for a model that is able to explain, describe, analyze and simulate
real-world complex networks is of uttermost practical as well as theoretical
interest. In this paper we introduce and study a network model that is based on
a latent attribute structure: each node is characterized by a number of
features and the probability of the existence of an edge between two nodes
depends on the features they share. Features are chosen according to a process
of Indian-Buffet type but with an additional random ""fitness"" parameter
attached to each node, that determines its ability to transmit its own features
to other nodes. As a consequence, a node's connectivity does not depend on its
age alone, so also ""young"" nodes are able to compete and succeed in acquiring
links. One of the advantages of our model for the latent bipartite
""node-attribute"" network is that it depends on few parameters with a
straightforward interpretation. We provide some theoretical, as well
experimental, results regarding the power-law behaviour of the model and the
estimation of the parameters. By experimental data, we also show how the
proposed model for the attribute structure naturally captures most local and
global properties (e.g., degree distributions, connectivity and distance
distributions) real networks exhibit. keyword: Complex network, social network,

necessarily relativistic, systems. As an application, we investigate
nonrelativistic general covariance in Galilei-invariant systems. The peculiar
transformation rules for the background metric and gauge fields, first
introduced by Son and Wingate in 2005 and refined in subsequent works, follow
naturally from our framework. Our approach makes it clear that Galilei or
Poincare symmetry is by no means a necessary prerequisite for making the theory
invariant under coordinate diffeomorphisms. General covariance merely expresses
the freedom to choose spacetime coordinates at will, whereas the true, physical
symmetries of the system can be separately implemented as ""internal"" symmetries
within the vielbein formalism. A systematic way to implement such symmetries is
provided by the coset construction. We illustrate this point by applying our
formalism to nonrelativistic s-wave superfluids.

undergoing the second order quantum phase transition is discussed. The analysis
is carried out using the Keldysh technique of the non-equilibrium dynamics
description. The critical behaviour close to the quantum critical point has
been shown to be multi-critical. Crossover among three different critical
regimes (modes) is possible: adiabatic quantum mode (AQM), dissipative
classical mode (classical critical dynamics mode (CCDM) and dissipative quantum
critical mode (QCDM). As a result, the observed critical behavior can
essentially depend on the conditions of approaching the critical point.

supernovae are believed to be undergoing the transition from the photospheric
phase, where spectra are characterized by line scattering above an optically
thick photosphere, to the nebular phase, where spectra consist of optically
thin emission from forbidden lines. We find that most spectral features in the
near-infrared can be accounted for by permitted lines of Fe II and Co II. In
addition, we find that [Ni II] fits the emission feature near 1.98 {\mu}m,
suggesting that a substantial mass of 58Ni exists near the center of the ejecta
in these objects, arising from nuclear burning at high density. A tentative
identification of Mn II at 1.15 {\mu}m may support this conclusion as well.

editor (e.g. content experts, social networkers) and we show that it does
provide a signal that predicts an editor's departure from the community. We
also show that long term editors gradually diversify their participation by
shifting edit preference from one or two namespaces to multiple namespaces and
experience relatively soft evolution in their editor profiles, while short term
editors generally distribute their contribution randomly among the namespaces
and experience considerably fluctuated evolution in their editor profiles.

games --- which in particular generalize both anonymous games and weighted
congestion games. For any such game that is also large, we solve the
equilibrium selection problem in a strong sense. In particular, we give an
efficient weak mediator: a mechanism which has only the power to listen to
reported types and provide non-binding suggested actions, such that (a) it is
an asymptotic Nash equilibrium for every player to truthfully report their type
to the mediator, and then follow its suggested action; and (b) that when
players do so, they end up coordinating on a particular asymptotic pure
strategy Nash equilibrium of the induced complete information game. In fact,
truthful reporting is an ex-post Nash equilibrium of the mediated game, so our
solution applies even in settings of incomplete information, and even when
player types are arbitrary or worst-case (i.e. not drawn from a common prior).
We achieve this by giving an efficient differentially private algorithm for
computing a Nash equilibrium in such games. The rates of convergence to
equilibrium in all of our results are inverse polynomial in the number of
players $n$. We also apply our main results to a multi-dimensional market game.
  Our results can be viewed as giving, for a rich class of games, a more robust
version of the Revelation Principle, in that we work with weaker informational
assumptions (no common prior), yet provide a stronger solution concept (ex-post
Nash versus Bayes Nash equilibrium). In comparison to previous work, our main
conceptual contribution is showing that weak mediators are a game theoretic

  We describe a generalized Thompson group $V_{(G, \theta)}$ for each finite

using the cloning systems introduced by Witzel and Zaremsky. We prove that
$V_{(G, \theta)}$ is co$\mathcal{CF}$ for any homomorphism $\theta$ and finite

  A version of a conjecture due to Lehnert says that a group has context-free
co-word problem exactly if it is a finitely generated subgroup of V. The groups
$V_{(G,\theta)}$ where $\theta$ is not the identity homomorphism do not appear
to have obvious embeddings into V, and may therefore be considered possible
counterexamples to the conjecture.
  Demonstrative subgroups of $V$, which were introduced by Bleak and
Salazar-Diaz, can be used to construct embeddings of certain wreath products
and amalgamated free products into $V$. We extend the class of known finitely
generated demonstrative subgroups of V to include all virtually cyclic groups.

there is a polynomial time constant factor Pareto approximation algorithm for
$k$ simultaneous Max-$F$-CSP instances. Our methods are quite general, and we
also use them to give an improved approximation factor for simultaneous

center of every halo, with a profile quite different from cores modeled in the
warm or self-interacting dark matter scenarios. Furthermore, we show that each
solitonic core is surrounded by an extended halo composed of large fluctuating
dark matter granules which modulate the halo density on a scale comparable to
the diameter of the solitonic core. The scaling symmetry of the SP equation and
the uncertainty principle tightly relate the core mass to the halo specific
energy, which, in the context of cosmological structure formation, leads to a
simple scaling between core mass ($M_c$) and halo mass ($M_h$), $M_c \propto
a^{-1/2} M_h^{1/3}$, where $a$ is the cosmic scale factor. We verify this
scaling relation by (i) examining the internal structure of a statistical
sample of virialized halos that form in our 3D cosmological simulations, and by
(ii) merging multiple solitons to create individual virialized objects.
Sufficient simulation resolution is achieved by adaptive mesh refinement and
graphic processing units acceleration. From this scaling relation, present
dwarf satellite galaxies are predicted to have kpc sized cores and a minimum
mass of $\sim 10^8 {M_\odot}$, capable of solving the small-scale controversies
in the cold dark matter model. Moreover, galaxies of $2\times10^{12} {M_\odot}$
at $z=8$ should have massive solitonic cores of $\sim 2\times10^9 {M_\odot}$

for funneling the gas that leads to the prompt formation of early stellar
spheroids and quasars.

treatment for people living with HIV. This 90-90-90 target would mean that, by
2020, 90% of all those living with HIV should know their status, 90% of these
would be on treatment and 90% of these would have fully suppressed plasma viral
loads. To reach this target in the next five years presents a major logistical
challenge. However, the prevalence of HIV varies greatly by risk groups, age,
gender, geography and social conditions. For reasons of effectiveness and
impact the focus must first be on those who are most likely to be infected with
HIV and therefore most likely to infect others. In Kenya the prevalence of HIV
in adults varies by two orders of magnitude among the counties. The effective
implementation of 90-90-90 will depend on first providing ART where the
prevalence of infection is greatest, then to those that are most easily reached
in large numbers and finally to the whole population. Here we use routine data
from ante-natal clinics and national survey data to assess the variation of the
prevalence of HIV among counties in Kenya; we suggest reasons for this
variation, and estimate the effectiveness of targeting the role out of ART. The
highest prevalence occurs in some of the counties bordering Lake Victoria and
these are most in need of ART. These districts in Nyanza Province, account for
31% of all cases in Kenya but make up 10% of the population and cover 1.8% of
the land-area. The highest concentrations of HIV cases are in Nairobi and
Mombasa which account for a further 18% of all cases in Kenya but make up 12%

a $G$-principal bundle $P_{G}\rightarrow M$ endowed with an Ehresmann

reduction mechanism. We claim that this reduction must be understood as a
partial gauge fixing of the local gauge symmetries of $P_{G}$, i.e. as a gauge
fixing that leaves ""unbroken"" the local Lorentz invariance. We then argue that

natural framework for systematically studying zero-vorticity waves over

original constraints of zero-vorticity by allowing for vertical vorticity which
is the case of most interest for coastal dynamics. The problem is reformulated
in terms of two dynamical equations on the boundary supplemented by one
equation that represents a kinematic constraint in the interior of the domain.
In this framework, the kinematic constraint can be solved to express Psi in
terms of canonically-conjugated variables. The formalism is demonstrated for
horizontally homogeneous flows over mild topography, where asymptotic
formulations for the Hamiltonian and Lagrangian functions are derived based on
the Helmholz-Hodge decomposition. For potential flows, the asymptotic form of
the Hamiltonian is identical to previous results. The Lagrangian function is
also expressed as an expansion in terms of the surface height and its time
derivative and compared with Zakharov's formalism where agreement is found for
one-dimensional wave scattering.

conditions, which may be prepared for the atom and the field, the time

the dynamics of atom by considering `atomic population inversion' and two
