concisely describe complex biological shapes and their dynamics. We
characterize undulatory bending waves of beating flagella and reconstruct a
limit cycle of flagellar oscillations, paying particular attention to the
periodicity of angular data. As a second example, we analyze non-convex
boundary outlines of gliding flatworms, which allows us to expose stereotypic
body postures that can be related to two different locomotion mechanisms.
Further, shape mode analysis based on principal component analysis allows to
discriminate different flatworm species, despite large motion-associated shape
variability. Thus, complex shape dynamics is characterized by a small number of
shape scores that change in time. We present this method using descriptive
examples, explaining abstract mathematics in a graphic way.

measurement missions (such as EPIC, LiteBIRD, PRISM and COrE) will be able to
constrain the inflationary landscape in the hardest to disambiguate situation
in which inflation is simply described by single-field slow-roll scenarios.
Considering the proposed PRISM and LiteBIRD satellite designs, we simulate mock
data corresponding to five different fiducial models having values of the
tensor-to-scalar ratio ranging from $10^{-1}$ down to $10^{-7}$. We then
compute the Bayesian evidences and complexities of all Encyclopaedia
Inflationaris models in order to assess the constraining power of PRISM alone
and LiteBIRD complemented with the Planck 2013 data. Within slow-roll
inflation, both designs have comparable constraining power and can rule out
about three quarters of the inflationary scenarios, compared to one third for
Planck 2013 data alone. However, we also show that PRISM can constrain the
scalar running and has the capability to detect a violation of slow roll at
second order. Finally, our results suggest that describing an inflationary
model by its potential shape only, without specifying a reheating temperature,
will no longer be possible given the accuracy level reached by the future CMB
missions.

from direct-collapse black holes (DCBHs) that are formed at z gtrsim 10 in the
primordial gas in the case that H2 cooling is suppressed by strong external
radiation. In this work, we study the critical specific intensity J^crit
required for DCBH formation for various radiation spectral shapes by a series
of one-zone calculations of a collapsing primordial- gas cloud. We calculate
the critical specific intensity at the Lyman-Werner (LW) bands J^crit_LW,21 (in
units of 10^-21 erg s^-1 Hz^-1 sr^-1 cm^-2) for realistic spectra of metal-poor
galaxies. We find J^crit is not sensitive to the age or metallicity for the
constant star formation galaxies with J^crit_LW,21 = 1300-1400, while J^crit
decreases as galaxies become older or more metal-enriched for the instantaneous
starburst galaxies. However, such dependence for the instantaneous starburst
galaxies is weak for the young or extremely metal-poor galaxies: J^crit_LW,21 =
1000-1400 for the young galaxies and J^crit_LW,21 approx 1400 for the extremely
metal-poor galaxies. The typical value of J^crit for the realistic spectra is
higher than those expected in the literature, which affects the estimated DCBH
number density n_DCBH. By extrapolating the result of Dijkstra, Ferrara and

the entanglement entropy in the large coupling limit is considered in these

the graph isomorphism problem is considered in SRGs by using the elements of
blocks of adjacency matrices. Two SRGs with the same parameters:
$(\eta,\kappa,\lambda,\nu)$ are isomorphic if they can be made identical by
relabeling their vertices. So the adjacency matrices of two isomorphic SRGs

it allows the involved electron-hole and hole-hole exchange interaction

interactions are found to be particularly useful for identifying QDs with high

the Schmidt numbers and entanglement entropy between two arbitrary partitions

there are some nodes in each parts which are not connected to the nodes of the
other part. So these nodes of each part, can be in distinct subsets. Therefore
the graph separates into four subsets. The nodes of the first and last subsets
are those which are not connected to the nodes of other part. In theorem I, by
using generalized Schur complement method in these four subsets, we prove that
all graphs which their connections between all two alternative subsets are
complete, have the same entropy. A large number of graphs satisfy this theorem.
Then the entanglement entropy in the limit of large coupling and large size of

fields. Understanding both of these contributions to hadronic structure is

on the transverse spin asymmetry (Sivers function) of quarks within the wave

guarantees, with high probability, routes whose lengths are within a constant

underlying the scalability of the publish protocol is for each potential
destination node to send location updates (with frequency decaying with
distance) to a subset of network nodes, structured as annular regions around it
(the natural approach of updating circular regions in distance-dependent
fashion does not scale). The routing protocol must therefore account for the
fact that the source and/or relay nodes may not have estimates of the
destination's location (or may have stale estimates). Spatial and temporal
scaling of protocol parameters are chosen so as to guarantee scalability, route
reliability and route stretch, and these analytical design prescriptions are
verified using simulations.

contribution owing to the cosmological neutrino background (C$\nu$B) is
investigated in the context of a radiation-to-matter dominated Universe.
Besides its inherent effects on the gravitational wave propagation, the
inclusion of the C$\nu$B anisotropic stress into the dynamical equations also
affects the tensor mode contribution to the anisotropy of the cosmological
microwave background (C$\gamma$B) temperature. Given that the fluctuations of
the C$\nu$B temperature in the (ultra)relativistic regime are driven by a
multipole expansion, the mutual effects on the gravitational waves and on the
C$\gamma$B are obtained through a unified prescription for a
radiation-to-matter dominated scenario. The results are confronted with some
preliminary results for the radiation dominated scenario. Both scenarios are
supported by a simplified analytical framework, in terms of a scale independent
dynamical variable, $k \eta$, that relates cosmological scales, $k$, and the
conformal time, $\eta$. The background relativistic (hot dark) matter
essentially works as an effective dispersive medium for the gravitational waves
such that the damping effect is intensified for the Universe evolving to the
matter dominated era. Changes on the temperature variance owing to the
inclusion of neutrino collision terms into the dynamical equations result into
spectral features that ratify that the multipole expansion coefficients

determine the corresponding finite volume effects. These computations are
performed using chiral perturbation theory to account for modified infrared

$\mathbb{C}(\mathbb{Z}_p)$ gauge degrees of freedom living on the links
together with matter degrees of freedom living on the vertices. The matter part
is described by a $n$ dimensional vector space which we call $H_n$. The
$\mathbb{Z}_p$ gauge particles act on the vertex particles and thus $H_n$ can
be thought of as a $\mathbb{C}(\mathbb{Z}_p)$ module. An exactly solvable model
is built with operators acting in the corresponding Hilbert space. The vertex
excitations for this model are studied and shown to obey non-Abelian fusion
rules. We will show this for specific values of $n$ and $p$, though we believe
this feature holds for all $n>p$. We will see that non-Abelian anyons of the
quantum double of $\mathbb{C}(S_3)$ are obtained as part of the vertex
excitations of the model with $n=6$ and $p=3$. Ising anyons are obtained in the
model with $n=4$ and $p=2$. The $n=3$ and $p=2$ case is also worked out as this
is the simplest model exhibiting non-Abelian fusion rules. Another common
feature shared by these models is that the ground states have a higher symmetry

(TT) phaser based on reflection-type (RT) phaser units is introduced,
theoretically studied and experimentally demonstrated. It is first shown that
RT phasers inherently exhibit higher R-ASP resolution than their TT
counterparts because their group delay swing is proportional to the reflection
coefficient associated with a resonator coupling mechanism (admittance
inverter), easy to maximize towards unity, rather than to a coupled-line
coupling coefficient, typically restricted to values will inferior to unity, as
in the RT case. Moreover, a detailed sensitivity analysis reveals that the
proposed phaser is simultaneously features high R-ASP resolution and low
sensitivity to fabrication tolerance, which makes it an ideal solution for
R-ASP. The proposed phaser exhibits a 5 ns group delay swing over a fractional
bandwidth of about 50% around 4 GHz.

phases, independent of their spatial separation. We first specify the exact
theory, ensuring that it is consistent and has (ordinary) quantum mechanics as
a fixed point, where all particles with the same values for a given observable
have the same phases. We then study the stability of this fixed point
numerically, and analytically, for simple models. We provide evidence that most
systems (in our study) are locally stable to small deviations from quantum
mechanics, and furthermore, the phase variance per value of the observable, as
well as systematic deviations from quantum mechanics, decay as $\sim$
(Energy$\times$Time)$^{-2n}$, where $n \geq 1$. Interestingly, this convergence
is controlled by the absolute value of energy (and not energy difference),
suggesting a possible connection to gravitational physics. Finally, we discuss

can be decomposed into two components: the exponential (""thermal"") and the

relative strength of these two components in Deep Inelastic Scattering depends
drastically upon the global structure of the event - namely, the exponential
component is absent in the diffractive events characterized by a rapidity gap.
We discuss the possible origin of this effect, and speculate that it is linked
to confinement. Specifically, we argue that the thermal component is due to the
effective event horizon introduced by the confining string, in analogy to the
Hawking-Unruh effect. In diffractive events, the $t$-channel exchange is
color-singlet and there is no fragmenting string -- so the thermal component is
absent. The slope of the soft component of the hadron spectrum in this picture
is determined by the saturation momentum that drives the deceleration in the
color field, and thus the Hawking-Unruh temperature. We analyze the data on
non-diffractive $pp$ collisions and find that the slope of the thermal
component of the hadron spectrum is indeed proportional to the saturation
momentum.

graph whose edges are unknown but can be accessed via queries. This is a
special case of stochastic $k$-set packing, where the problem is to find a
maximum packing of sets, each of which exists with some probability. In this
paper, we provide edge and set query algorithms for these two problems,
respectively, that provably achieve some fraction of the omniscient optimal
solution.
  Our main theoretical result for the stochastic matching (i.e., $2$-set
packing) problem is the design of an \emph{adaptive} algorithm that queries
only a constant number of edges per vertex and achieves a $(1-\epsilon)$
fraction of the omniscient optimal solution, for an arbitrarily small
$\epsilon>0$. Moreover, this adaptive algorithm performs the queries in only a
constant number of rounds. We complement this result with a \emph{non-adaptive}
(i.e., one round of queries) algorithm that achieves a $(0.5 - \epsilon)$
fraction of the omniscient optimum. We also extend both our results to
stochastic $k$-set packing by designing an adaptive algorithm that achieves a
$(\frac{2}{k} - \epsilon)$ fraction of the omniscient optimal solution, again
with only $O(1)$ queries per element. This guarantee is close to the best known
polynomial-time approximation ratio of $\frac{3}{k+1} -\epsilon$ for the
\emph{deterministic} $k$-set packing problem [Furer and Yu, 2013]
  We empirically explore the application of (adaptations of) these algorithms
to the kidney exchange problem, where patients with end-stage renal failure
swap willing but incompatible donors. We show on both generated data and on
real data from the first 169 match runs of the UNOS nationwide kidney exchange
that even a very small number of non-adaptive edge queries per vertex results
in large gains in expected successful matches.

structure of the bipolar Homunculus nebula surrounding Eta Carinae, as mapped
by new ESO VLT/X-Shooter observations of the H2 $\lambda=2.12125$ micron
emission line. Our results reveal for the first time important deviations from
the axisymmetric bipolar morphology: 1) circumpolar trenches in each lobe
positioned point-symmetrically from the center and 2) off-planar protrusions in
the equatorial region from each lobe at longitudinal (~55 degrees) and
latitudinal (10-20 degrees) distances from the projected apastron direction of
the binary orbit. The angular distance between the protrusions (~110 degrees)
is similar to the angular extent of each polar trench (~130 degrees) and nearly
equal to the opening angle of the wind-wind collision cavity (~110 degrees). As
in previous studies, we confirm a hole near the centre of each polar lobe and
no detectable near-IR H2 emission from the thin optical skirt seen prominently
in visible imagery. We conclude that the interaction between the outflows
and/or radiation from the central binary stars and their orientation in space
has had, and possibly still has, a strong influence on the Homunculus. This
implies that prevailing theoretical models of the Homunculus are incomplete as
most assume a single star origin that produces an axisymmetric nebula. We
discuss how the newly found features might be related to the Homunculus
ejection, the central binary and the interacting stellar winds. We also include
a 3D printable version of our Homunculus model.

particles within the collapsing cloud are taken into account. To this purpose,
we take the matter content of the stellar object as a homogeneous Weyssenhoff
fluid which is a generalization of perfect fluid in general relativity (GR) to
include the spin of matter. Employing the homogeneous and isotropic FLRW metric
for the interior spacetime setup, it is shown that the spin of matter, in the
context of a negative pressure, acts against the pull of gravity and
decelerates the dynamical evolution of the collapse in its later stages. Our
results bode a picture of gravitational collapse in which the collapse process
halts at a finite radius whose value depends on the initial configuration. We
thus show that the spacetime singularity that occurs in the OS model is
replaced by a non-singular bounce beyond which the collapsing cloud re-expands
to infinity. Depending on the model parameters, one can find a minimum value
for the boundary of the collapsing cloud or correspondingly a threshold value
for the mass content below which the horizon formation can be avoided. Our
results are supported by a thorough numerical analysis.

function, and optimize the tensor elements via variational Monte Carlo. The
entanglement already contained in the input wave function can considerably
reduce the bond dimensions compared to the regular tensor-product state
representation. In particular, this allows us to also represent states that do
not obey the area law of entanglement entropy. In addition, for fermionic
systems, the fermion sign structure can be encoded in the input wave function.

WIMPs abundance to have a precise analytical form down to the temperature
$x_\ast=m_\chi /T_\ast$. The point $x_\ast$, which coincides with the
stationary point of the equation for the quantity $\Delta= Y-Y_0$, is where the
maximum departure of the WIMPs abundance $Y$ from the thermal value $Y_0$ is
reached. For each mass $m_\chi$ and total annihilation cross section $\langle
\sigma_\text{ann}v_\text{r}\rangle$, the temperature $x_\ast$ and the actual
WIMPs abundance $Y(x_\ast)$ are exactly known. This value provides the true
initial condition for the usual differential equation that have to be
integrated in the interval $x\ge x_\ast$. The matching of the two abundances at
$x_\ast$ is continuous and differentiable. The dependence of the present relic
abundance on the abundance at an intermediate temperature is an exact result.
The exact theory suggests a new analytical approximation that furnishes the
relic abundance accurate at the level of $1\%-2\%$ in the case of $S$-wave and
$P$-wave scattering cross sections. We conclude the paper studying the

photo--dissociation by Lyman--Werner photons ($11.2 - 13.6$ eV), and H$^-$
photo--detachment by 0.76 eV photons emanating from self-consistent stellar
populations that we model using publicly available stellar synthesis codes. So
far studies that include chemical networks for the formation of molecular
hydrogen take these processes into account by assuming that the source spectra
can be approximated by a power-law dependency or a black-body spectrum at
10$^4$ or $10^5$ K. We show that using spectra generated from realistic stellar
population models can alter the reaction rates for photo-dissociation, $\rm
k_{\rm{di}}$, and photo-detachment, $\rm k_{\rm{de}}$, significantly. In
particular, $\rm k_{\rm{de}}$ can be up to $\sim 2-4$ orders of magnitude lower
in the case of realistic stellar spectra suggesting that previous calculations
have over-estimated the impact that radiation has on lowering H$_2$ abundances.
In contrast to burst modes of star formation, we find that models with
continuous star formation predict increasing $\rm k_{\rm{de}}$ and $\rm
k_{\rm{di}}$, which makes it necessary to include the star formation history of
sources to derive self-consistent reaction rates, and that it is not enough to
just calculate J$_{21}$ for the background. For models with constant star
formation rate the change in shape of the spectral energy distribution leads to
a non-negligible late-time contribution to $\rm k_{\rm{de}}$ and $\rm
k_{\rm{di}}$, and we present self-consistently derived cosmological reaction
rates based on star formation rates consistent with observations of the high
redshift Universe.

formation by dissipating and thermalizing kinetic energy of gas flows, thereby
heating the universe. Furthermore, identifying shocks in hydrodynamical
simulations and measuring their Mach number accurately is critical for
calculating the production of non-thermal particle components through diffusive
shock acceleration. However, shocks are often significantly broadened in
numerical simulations, making it challenging to implement an accurate shock
finder. We here introduce a refined methodology for detecting shocks in the
moving-mesh code AREPO, and show that results for shock statistics can be
sensitive to implementation details. We put special emphasis on filtering
against spurious shock detections due to tangential discontinuities and
contacts. Both of them are omnipresent in cosmological simulations, for example
in the form of shear-induced Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities and cold fronts. As
an initial application of our new implementation, we analyse shock statistics
in non-radiative cosmological simulations of dark matter and baryons. We find
that the bulk of energy dissipation at redshift zero occurs in shocks with Mach
numbers around ${\cal M}\approx2.7$. Furthermore, almost $40\%$ of the
thermalization is contributed by shocks in the warm hot intergalactic medium
(WHIM), whereas $\approx60\%$ occurs in clusters, groups and smaller halos.
Compared to previous studies, these findings revise the characterization of the
most important shocks towards higher Mach numbers and lower density structures.
Our results also suggest that regions with densities above and below
$\delta_b=100$ should be roughly equally important for the energetics of cosmic
ray acceleration through large-scale structure shocks.

distributions narrower than that of the Orion Nebula Cluster, indicating a
possible trend of narrower age distributions for denser clusters. We show this
effect to likely arise from star formation being faster in gas with a higher
density. We model the star formation history of molecular clumps in equilibrium
by associating a star formation efficiency (SFE) per free-fall time, \eff, to
their volume density profile. Our model predicts a steady decline of the star
formation rate (SFR), which we quantify with its half-life time, namely, the
time needed for the SFR to drop to half its initial value.
  Given the uncertainties affecting the SFE per free-fall time, we consider two
distinct values: 0.1 and 0.01. For isothermal spheres, \eff=0.1 leads to a
half-life time of order the clump free-fall time, \tff. Therefore, the age
distributions of stars formed in high-density clumps have smaller full-widths
at half-maximum than those of stars formed in low-density clumps. When
\eff=0.01, the half-life time is 10 times longer. We explore what happens if
the star formation duration is shorter than 10\tff, that is, if the half-life
time of the SFR cannot be defined. There, we build on the invariance of the
shape of the young cluster mass function to show that an anti-correlation
between clump density and star formation duration is expected. Therefore,
regardless of whether the star formation duration is longer than the SFR
half-life time, denser molecular clumps yield narrower star age distributions
in clusters.
  Published densities and stellar age spreads of young clusters actually
suggest that the time-scale for star formation is of order 1-4\tff. We conclude
that there is no need to invoke the existence of multiple cluster formation
mechanisms to explain the observed range of stellar age spreads in clusters.

than 2.25 h dramatically decrease the scaleheight: the scaleheight of the

exponential function with a scaleheight of 213$^{+11}_{-10}$ pc. However, we
suggest that the scaleheight of CVs in the Solar vicinity should be $\sim$300
pc and that the scaleheights derived using the sech$^2$ function should be also

however, generically break SU(2) spin symmetry as a result of spin-orbit
coupling - which in many materials provides an `order one' effect. We
generalize previous works by using the projective symmetry group method to
classify $Z_2$ spin liquids on the square lattice when SU(2) spin symmetry is
maximally lifted. We find that, counterintuitively, the lifting of spin
symmetry actually results in vastly more spin liquid phases compared to
SU(2)-invariant systems. A generic feature of the SU(2)-broken case is that the
spinons naturally undergo $p+ip$ pairing; consequently, many of these $Z_2$
spin liquids feature a topologically nontrivial spinon band structure
supporting gapless Majorana edge states. We study in detail several spin-liquid

$V_{outflow}=40-80$ km/s to reproduce the transverse MgII absorption
kinematics, which is consistent with the range of $V_{dtb}$. The galaxy has a

Sun; the latter was obtained from light reflected of asteroids. We determine
differential abundances of the binary components relative to the Sun and
between components A and B as well. We achieve a precision of about 0.005 dex

surface gravities found for 16 Cyg A and B are Teff = 5830+/-7 K, log g =
4.30+/-0.02 dex, and Teff = 5751+/-6 K, log g = 4.35+/-0.02 dex, respectively.
The component 16 Cyg A has a metallicity ([Fe/H]) higher by 0.047+/-0.005 dex

elements show abundance differences between the binary components, but while
the volatile difference is about 0.03 dex, the refractories differ by more and
show a trend with condensation temperature, which could be interpreted as the
signature of the rocky accretion core of the giant planet 16 Cyg Bb. We
estimate a mass of about 1.5-6 M_Earth for this rocky core, in good agreement

processing and transmission compared to classical technology; however,
determining which specific resources are needed to surpass the capabilities of
classical machines often remains a nontrivial problem. To address such a
problem, one first needs to establish the best classical solutions, which set
benchmarks that must be beaten by any implementation claiming to harness
quantum features for an enhanced performance. Here we introduce and develop a
self-contained formalism to obtain the ultimate, generally probabilistic
benchmarks for quantum information protocols including teleportation and
approximate cloning, with arbitrary ensembles of input states generated by a
group action, so-called Gilmore-Perelomov coherent states. This allows us to
construct explicit fidelity thresholds for the transmission of multimode
Gaussian and non-Gaussian states of continuous variable systems, as well as
qubit and qudit pure states drawn according to nonuniform distributions on the
Bloch hypersphere, which accurately model the current laboratory facilities.
The performance of deterministic classical procedures such as square-root
measurement strategies is further compared with the optimal probabilistic
benchmarks, and the state-of-the-art performance of experimental quantum
implementations against our newly derived thresholds is discussed. This work
provides a comprehensive collection of directly useful criteria for the
reliable certification of quantum communication technologies.

The phase transition structure in viable regions of parameter space exhibits a
rich phenomenology, potentially giving rise to one- or two-step first-order
phase transitions in the singlet and/or $SU(2)$ directions. We compute several
parameters pertaining to the bubble wall profile, including the bubble wall
width and $\Delta\beta$ (the variation of the ratio in Higgs vacuum expectation
values across the wall). These quantities can vary significantly across small
regions of parameter space and can be promising for successful electroweak
baryogenesis. We estimate the wall velocity microphysically, taking into
account the various sources of friction acting on the expanding bubble wall.
Ultra-relativistic solutions to the bubble wall equations of motion typically
exist when the electroweak phase transition features substantial supercooling.
For somewhat weaker transitions, the bubble wall instead tends to be
sub-luminal and, in fact, likely sub-sonic, suggesting that successful
electroweak baryogenesis may indeed occur in regions of the NMSSM compatible

glasses has long been interpreted in terms of many pure states organized
ultrametrically. However, the early version of this interpretation, as applied
to the short-range Edwards-Anderson model, runs into problems because as shown
by Newman and Stein (NS) it does not allow for chaotic size dependence, and
predicts non-self-averaging that cannot occur. NS proposed the concept of the
metastate (a probability distribution over infinite-size Gibbs states in a
given sample that captures the effects of chaotic size dependence) and a
non-standard interpretation of the RSB results in which the metastate is
non-trivial and is responsible for what was called non-self-averaging. Here we
use the effective field theory of RSB, in conjunction with the rigorous
definitions of pure states and the metastate in infinite-size systems, to show
that the non-standard picture follows directly from the RSB mean-field theory.
In addition, the metastate-averaged state possesses power-law correlations
throughout the low temperature phase; the corresponding exponent $\zeta$ takes
the value $4$ according to the field theory in high dimensions $d$, and
describes the effective fractal dimension of clusters of spins. Further, the
logarithm of the number of pure states in the decomposition of the
metastate-averaged state that can be distinguished if only correlations in a
window of size $W$ can be observed is of order $W^{d-\zeta}$. These results
extend the non-standard picture quantitatively; we show that arguments against
this scenario are inconclusive.

observations include first-time X-ray detections of hot bubbles within NGC

The addition of the Cycle 14 results brings the overall ChanPlaNS diffuse X-ray

become clearer that diffuse X-ray emission is associated with young (<~5x10^3

central electron densities (n_e>~1000 cm^-3), and rarely associated with PNe
that show H_2 emission and/or pronounced butterfly structures. Hb 5 is one such

$X_{m}$-Laguerre polynomials, each omitting $m$ polynomials. We briefly discuss
these polynomials and construct self-adjoint operators generated by their
corresponding second-order differential expressions in appropriate Hilbert
spaces. In addition, we present a new Type III family of $X_{m}$-Laguerre
polynomials along with a detailed disquisition of its properties. We include
several representations of these polynomials, orthogonality, norms,

The
main result of this note is to give several equivalent criteria for the
untwistedness of the twisted cubes introduced by Grossberg and Karshon. In
certain cases arising from representation theory, Grossberg and Karshon
obtained a Demazure-type character formula for irreducible $G$-representations
as a sum over lattice points (counted with sign according to a density
function) of these twisted cubes. A twisted cube is untwisted when it is a
""true"" (i.e. closed, convex) polytope; in this case, Grossberg and Karshon's
character formula becomes a purely positive formula with no multiplicities,
i.e. each lattice point appears precisely once in the formula, with coefficient
$+1$. One of our equivalent conditions for untwistedness is that a certain
divisor on the special fiber of a toric degeneration of a Bott-Samelson
variety, as constructed by Pasquier, is basepoint-free. We also show that the
strict positivity of some of the defining constants for the twisted cube,
together with convexity (of its support), is enough to guarantee untwistedness.
Finally, in the special case when the twisted cube arises from the
representation-theoretic data of $\lambda$ an integral weight and
$\underline{w}$ a choice of word decomposition of a Weyl group element, we give
two simple necessary conditions for untwistedness which is stated in terms of
$\lambda$ and $\underline{w}$.

tables, both research and commercial. One of their aims has been to replace the
first generation of file sharing software with scalable peer-to-peer
architectures. On other fronts, the same techniques are applied, for example,
to content delivery networks, streaming networks, cooperative caches,
distributed file systems, and grid computing architectures for scientific use.
This trend has emerged because with cooperative peers it is possible to
asymptotically enhance the use of resouces in sharing of data compared to the
basic client-server architecture.
  The need for distribution of data is wide and one could argue that it is as
fundamental a building block as the message passing of the Internet. As an
answer to this need a new scalable architecture is introduced: Hybrid
Communication Architecture (HCA), which provides both data sharing and message
passing as communication primitives for applications. HCA can be regarded as an
abstraction layer for communication which is further encapsulated by a
higher-level middleware. HCA is aimed at general use, and it is not designed
for any particular application. One key idea is to combine data sharing with
streaming since together they enable many applications not easily implementable
with only one of these features. For example, a game application could share
the game world state between clients and modify it by using streaming. The
other distinctive feature of the system is the use of knowledge of the physical
network topology in the optimization of the communication. With a feasible
business model, fault-tolerance, and security features, HCA is aimed eventually
for real-life adoption.
  This thesis presents the specification of the C++ client interface of HCA and
the architecture and protocol of the distributed nodes forming the
implementation.

chemistry. Reaction-diffusion (RD) mechanisms are, however, essential to
understand how shape emerges in the living world. While numerical methods
confirm the incredible potential of RD mechanisms to generate patterns, their
experimental implementation, despite great efforts, has yet to surpass the
paradigm of stationary Turing patterns achieved 25 years ago. The principal
reason for our difficulty to synthesize arbitrary concentration patterns from
scratch is the lack of fully programmable reaction-diffusion systems. To solve
this problem we introduce here a DNA-based system where kinetics and diffusion
can be individually tuned. We demonstrate the capability to precisely control
reaction-diffusion properties with an autocatalytic network that propagates in
a one-dimensional reactor with uniform velocity, typically 100 {\mu}m min-1.
The diffusion coefficient of the propagating species can be reduced up to a
factor 2.7 using a species-specific strategy relying on self-assembled
hydrodynamic drags. Our approach is modular as we illustrate by designing three
alternative front generating systems, two of which can pass through each other
with little interaction. Importantly, the strategies to control kinetics and
diffusion are orthogonal to each other resulting in simple programming rules.
Our results can be quantitatively predicted from first-principle RD equations
and are in excellent agreement with a generalized Fisher-
Kolmogorov-Petrovskii-Piscunov analytical model. Together, these advances open
the way for the rational engineering of far-from-equilibrium arbitrary patterns
and could lead to the synthesis of self-organizing materials.

statistically characterize the delayed actuation propagation through the body

adopt the Extended Zel'dovich (EZL) model as a basic framework, focusing on the
case of primordial non-Gaussianity of the local type whose degree is quantified
by a single parameter $f_{nl}$. By making a quantitative comparison with the
N-body results, we first demonstrate that the EZL formula with the constant
values of three fitting parameters still works remarkably well for the local
$f_{nl}$ case. We also modify the EZL formula to find an analytic expression
for the mass function of isolated clusters which turns out to have only one
fitting parameter other than the overall normalization factor and showed that
the modified EZL formula with a constant value of the fitting parameter matches
excellently the N-body results with various values of $f_{nl}$ at various
redshifts. Given the simplicity of the generalized EZL formulae and their good
agreements with the numerical results, we finally conclude that the EZL mass
functions of the massive clusters and isolated clusters should be useful as an
analytic guideline to constrain the scale dependence of the primordial

radio broadcast channel with one secondary transmitter (ST) and two secondary
receivers (SRs) under quality-of-service constraints and interference power
limitations. We initially describe three different cooperative channel sensing
strategies with different hard-decision combining algorithms at the ST, namely
OR, Majority, and AND rules. Since the channel sensing occurs with possible
errors, we consider a combined interference power constraint by which the
transmission power of the secondary users (SUs) is bounded when the channel is
sensed as both busy and idle. Furthermore, regarding the channel sensing
decision and its correctness, there exist possibly four different transmission
scenarios. We provide the instantaneous ergodic capacities of the channel
between the ST and each SR in all of these scenarios. Granting that
transmission outage arises when the instantaneous transmission rate is greater
than the instantaneous ergodic capacity, we establish two different
transmission rate policies for the SUs when the channel is sensed as idle. One
of these policies features a greedy approach disregarding a possible
transmission outage, and the other favors a precautious manner to prevent this
outage. Subsequently, we determine the effective capacity region of this
channel model, and we attain the power allocation policies that maximize this
region. Finally, we present the numerical results. We first show the
superiority of Majority rule when the channel sensing results are good. Then,
we illustrate that a greedy transmission rate approach is more beneficial for
the SUs under strict interference power constraints, whereas sending with lower
rates will be more advantageous under loose interference constraints.

is applied to a set of signals drawn from a continuous family; decision
thresholds must be determined as a function of the continuous parameter x
characterizing the signals, and false alarms occur, not with a discrete
probability, but with a density in x. A Bayes decision structure over the
domain of signal parameters yields a state estimate of the signal parameter x
as an integral part of a signal declaration. The decision criterion is
converted to a form in which detection and false alarm densities appear and
from which is derived a relation between them for all x. The limiting case of
additive Gaussian noise and a high detection threshold allows a simplified
decision criterion and a state estimate of signal location in x that approaches
the Cramer-Rao bound. Also in this limit, an analytic form for the false alarm
probability density over x, a quantity not readily obtained in general, is
evaluated here through its relation to the detection probability. The false

BNL is the precise determination of the polarized gluon distribution function,
$\Delta g(x)$. Polarized $\vec{p}+\vec{p}$ collisions at $\sqrt{s}=200\,$GeV
and at $\sqrt{s}=500\,$GeV at RHIC provide an unique way to probe the proton
spin structure. Inclusive measurements, such as inclusive jet and hadron
production, have so far been the prime focus of various results at
$\sqrt{s}=200\,$GeV constraining $\Delta g(x)$ for $0.05<x<0.2$. A recent
global analysis provides for the first time evidence of a non-zero value of the
gluon polarization $\int_{\tiny 0.05}^{\tiny 1}\Delta g (x)\, dx
\,(Q^{2}=10\,{\rm GeV}^{2}) = 0.20^{+0.06}_{-0.07}$. First results of di-jet
production at $\sqrt{s}=200\,$GeV by the STAR collaboration will allow a better
constraint of the underlying event kinematics. Extending the current program to
smaller values of $x$ is a key goal for the future high-energy spin physics
program at RHIC. Forward di-jet production measurements at STAR beyond the
current acceptance from $-1<\eta<+2$ to $+2.5<\eta<+4$, in particular those
carried out at $\sqrt{s}=500\,$GeV, provides access to low $x$ values at the
level of $10^{-3}$ where current uncertainties of $\Delta g(x)$ remain very
large. Those measurements will eventually be complemented by a future
Electron-Ion Collider facility probing $\Delta g(x)$ in polarized

To this end we have undertaken a laboratory study of photonic lanterns with the

photonic lanterns with between 19 and 61 cores. We present the results of this

superoutburst, followed by a short rebrightening. During the rising branch of
the main superoutburst, we detected growing superhumps (stage A superhumps)
with a period of 0.03409(1) d. During the plateau phase of the superoutburst,
superhumps with a shorter period (stage B superhumps) were observed. Using the

alternative to previous variational formulations based on Low's Lagrangian or
on a Hamiltonian with a non-canonical Poisson bracket. The useful property of
this variational principle is that it allows independent transformations of
particle coordinates and velocities, i.e., transformations in particle phase
space. With such transformations, a finite degree-of-freedom drift-kinetic
action is obtained through time-averaging of the finite degree-of-freedom
fully-kinetic action. Variation of the drift-kinetic Lagrangian density leads
to a self-consistent, macro-particles and fields numerical model. Since the
computational particles utilize only guiding center coordinates and velocities,
there is a large computational advantage in the time integration part of the
algorithm. Numerical comparison between the time-averaged fully-kinetic and
drift-kinetic charge and current, deposited on a computational grid, offers
insight into the range of validity of the model. Being based on a variational
principle, the algorithm respects the energy conserving property of the
underlying continuous system. The development in this paper serves to further
emphasize the advantages of using variational approaches in plasma particle
simulations.

the role that early stages of shock development have on this type of
instability. We look at the evolution of shock waves driven by a piston in a
dilute system of smooth inelastic disks, using both discrete-particle and
continuum modelling. To mimic a realistic granular gas, viscoelastic collisions
are approximated with an impact velocity threshold $u^*$ needed for inelastic
collisions to occur. We show that behaviour of the shock evolution is dependent
on the ratio of piston velocity to impact velocity threshold $u_p/u^*$, and the
coefficient of restitution $\varepsilon$. For $u_p/u^*=2.0$, we recover shock
evolution behaving similar to that observed in purely inelastic media. This is
characterized by a short period where the shock front pulls towards the piston
before attaining a developed structure. No pullback is seen for $u_p/u^*=1.0$.
Results show the onset of instability for these stronger shocks during this
evolving stage. These results suggest that the early stages of shock evolution
play an important role in the shock instability.

non-zero Chern numbers has only been revealed in electronic systems. Here we
use studies of an atomic cloud's transverse deflection in response to an
optical gradient to measure the Chern number of artificially generated
Hofstadter bands. These topological bands are very flat and thus constitute
good candidates for the realization of fractional Chern insulators. Combining
these deflection measurements with the determination of the band populations,
we obtain an experimental value for the Chern number of the lowest band
$\nu_{\mathrm{exp}} =0.99(5)$. This result, which constitutes the first
Chern-number measurement in a non-electronic system, is facilitated by an
all-optical artificial gauge field scheme, generating uniform flux in optical
superlattices.

applications. Calibration is an essential step for these applications. After
calibration, we can rectify the captured image by using the calibrated camera
parameters. However, the large camera array calibration method, which assumes
that all cameras are on the same plane, ignores the orientation and intrinsic
parameters. The multi-camera calibration technique usually assumes that the
working volume and viewpoints are fixed. In this paper, we describe a
calibration algorithm suitable for a mobile camera array based light field
acquisition system. The algorithm performs in Zhang's style by moving a
checkerboard, and computes the initial parameters in closed form. Global
optimization is then applied to refine all the parameters simultaneously. Our
implementation is rather flexible in that users can assign the number of
viewpoints and refinement of intrinsic parameters is optional. Experiments on
both simulated data and real data acquired by a commercial product show that
our method yields good results. Digital refocusing application shows the
calibrated light field can well focus to the target object we desired.

by the AC field we use Floquet theory to find quasi energies with their

field rescales the spin orbit and hopping amplitudes in terms of Bessel
functions. The zeros of the Bessel functions are of the form of a ratio of AC
field strength to its frequency and quasi energies at these points form
anti-crossings in our case. We first prepare the system in a triplet state and
study the evolution of its probability in the presence of spin-orbit
interaction alone. We observe an oscillatory behavior which indicates spin flip
transitions. However when the AC field is turned on the probability
oscillations are highly suppressed at anti-crossing points leading to
localization of initial state and the state retains its memory of spin even in
the presence of spin flip interaction.

general Hamiltonian formalism by connecting waveguide modes to reservoir modes
with a phenomenological coupling Hamiltonian, the parameters of which are later
related to the usual loss coefficients. In the limit of a low probability of
SPDC pair production, the presence of loss requires that we write the usual
lossless generated pair state as a reduced density operator, and we find that
this density operator is naturally composed of two photon, one photon, and zero
photon contributions. The biphoton probability density, or joint spectral
intensity (JSI), associated with the two-photon contribution is determined not
only by a phase matching term, but also by a loss matching term. The relative
size of the loss coefficients within this term lead to three qualitatively
different regimes of SPDC JSIs. If either the pump or generated photon loss is
much higher than the other, the side lobes of the phase matching squared sinc
function are washed out. On the other hand, if pump and generated photon loss
are appropriately balanced, the lossy JSI is identical to the lossless JSI.
Finally, if the generated photon loss is frequency dependent, the shape of the
JSI can be altered more severely, potentially leading to generated photons that
are less frequency correlated though also produced less efficiently when
compared to photons generated in low-loss waveguides.

parameter, scalar trilinear couplings and gaugino mass parameters are all
aligned. Since all dangerous CP violating phases are suppressed, we are now
safe to consider low-energy SUSY scenarios. As an application, we consider a
gravity mediation model explaining the observed muon $g-2$ anomaly. The CP-safe
property originates in two simple assumptions: SUSY breaking in the K\""ahler
potential and a shift symmetry of a SUSY breaking field $Z$. As a result of the
shift symmetry, the imaginary part of $Z$ behaves as a QCD axion, leading to an
intriguing possibility: the strong CP problem in QCD and the SUSY CP problem
are solved simultaneously.

generally appear bluer while they brighten. The physics behind the variations
in fluxes and colors remains unclear. Using SDSS g and r band photometric
monitoring data of quasars in Stripe 82, we find that although the flux
variation amplitude increases with timescale, the color variability exhibits
opposite behavior. The color variability of quasars is prominent at timescales
as short as ~ 10 days, but gradually reduces toward timescales up to years. In
other words, the variable emission at shorter timescales is bluer than that at
longer timescales. This timescale dependence is clearly and consistently
detected at all redshifts from z = 0 to 3.5, thus can not be due to
contaminations to broadband photometry from emission lines which do not respond
to fast continuum variations. The discovery directly rules out the possibility
that simply attributes the color variability to contamination from a
non-variable redder component, such as the host galaxy. It can not be
interpreted as changes in global accretion rate either. The thermal accretion
disk fluctuation model is favored, in the sense that fluctuations in the inner
hotter region of the disk are responsible for short term variations, while
longer term and stronger variations are expected from larger and cooler disk
region. An interesting implication is that one can use quasar variations at
different timescales to probe disk emission at different radii.

are predominantly thin, nearly oblate disks, in line with previous studies. We
now extend this to higher redshifts, and find that among massive galaxies (M* >
1e10 Msol) disks are the most common geometric shape at all z < 2. Lower-mass
galaxies at z>1 possess a broad range of geometric shapes: the fraction of
elongated (prolate) galaxies increases toward higher redshifts and lower
masses. Galaxies with stellar mass 1e9 Msol (1e10 Msol) are a mix of roughly
equal numbers of elongated and disk galaxies at z~1 (z~2). This suggests that
galaxies in this mass range do not yet have disks that are sustained over many
orbital periods, implying that galaxies with present-day stellar mass
comparable to that of the Milky Way typically first formed such sustained
stellar disks at redshift z~1.5-2. Combined with constraints on the evolution

interdependence in statistical data. However, for the stochastic processes with
heavy-tailed distributions such that the variance diverges, these tools are
inadequate. The heavy-tailed processes are ubiquitous in nature and finance. We
here discuss codifference as a convenient measure to study statistical
interdependence, and we aim to give a short introductory review of its
properties. By taking different known stochastic processes as generic examples,
we present explicit formulas for their codifferences. We show that for the
Gaussian processes codifference is equivalent to covariance. For processes with
finite variance these two measures behave similarly with time. For the
processes with infinite variance the covariance does not exist, however, the
codifference is relevant. We demonstrate the practical importance of the
codifference by extracting this function from simulated as well as from real
experimental data. We conclude that the codifference serves as a convenient
practical tool to study interdependence for stochastic processes with both
infinite and finite variances as well.

stimulated-echo analyses allows us to determine correlation times in very broad
time and temperature ranges. For the studied pore diameters, 2.1-2.9 nm, we
find two crossovers in the temperature-dependent correlation times of liquid
water upon cooling. At 220-230 K, a first kink in the temperature dependence is
accompanied by a solidification of a fraction of the confined water, implying
that the observed crossover is due to a change from bulk-like to
interface-dominated water dynamics, rather than to a liquid-liquid phase
transition. Moreover, the results provide evidence that $\alpha$ process-like
dynamics is probed above the crossover temperature, whereas $\beta$
process-like dynamics is observed below. At 180-190 K, we find a second change
of the temperature dependence, which resembles that reported for the $\beta$
process of supercooled liquids during the glass transition, suggesting a value
of $T_g\!\approx\!185$ K for interface-affected liquid water. In the
high-temperature range, $T\!>\!225$ K, the temperature dependence of water
reorientation is weaker in the smaller C10 pores than in the larger C12 and C14
pores, where it is more bulk-like, indicating a significant effect of the
silica confinement on the $\alpha$ process of water in the former 2.1 nm
confinement. By contrast, the temperature dependence of water reorientation is
largely independent of the confinement size and described by an Arrhenius law
with an activation energy of $E_a\!\approx\!0.5\ $eV in the low-temperature

addressed in many relevant scenarios. In the context of networked software
services, a widespread programming language-based approach relies on global
specifications defined by session types or behavioral contracts. Static type
checking can then be used to ensure that components follow the prescribed
interaction protocols. In the case of session types, developments have been
mostly framed within quite different type theories for either binary
(two-party) or multiparty (n-party) protocols. Unfortunately, the precise
relationship between analysis techniques for multiparty and binary protocols is
yet to be understood.
  In this work, we bridge this previously open gap in a principled way: we show
that the analysis of multiparty protocols can also be developed within a much
simpler type theory for binary protocols, ensuring protocol fidelity and
deadlock-freedom. We present characterization theorems which provide new
insights on the relation between two existing, yet very differently motivated,
session type systems---one based on linear logic, the other based on automata
theory---and suggest useful type-based verification techniques for multiparty

demonstrate a novel technique of interferometrically measuring large-scale
diffuse emission extending far beyond the primary beam (global signal) for the
first time. In particular, we show that (i) the Moon appears as a negative-flux
source at frequencies $35<\nu<80$ MHz since it is `colder' than the diffuse
Galactic background it occults, (ii) using the (negative) flux of the lunar
disc, we can reconstruct the spectrum of the diffuse Galactic emission with the
lunar thermal emission as a reference, and (iii) that reflected RFI
(radio-frequency interference) is concentrated at the center of the lunar disc
due to specular nature of reflection, and can be independently measured. Our
RFI measurements show that (i) Moon-based Cosmic Dawn experiments must design
for an Earth-isolation of better than $80$ dB to achieve an RFI temperature
$<1$ mK, (ii) Moon-reflected RFI contributes to a dipole temperature less than
$20$ mK for Earth-based Cosmic Dawn experiments, (iii) man-made
satellite-reflected RFI temperature exceeds $20$ mK if the aggregate cross
section of visible satellites exceeds $80$ m$^2$ at $800$ km height, or $5$
m$^2$ at $400$ km height. Currently, our diffuse background spectrum is limited
by sidelobe confusion on short baselines (10-15% level). Further refinement of
our technique may yield constraints on the redshifted global $21$-cm signal
from Cosmic Dawn ($40>z>12$) and the Epoch of Reionization ($12>z>5$).

have been investigated through resonant elastic scattering of $^{17}$F+$p$. The
radioactive $^{17}$F beam was separated by the CNS Radioactive Ion Beam

recoiling light particles were measured by three ${\Delta}$E-E silicon
telescopes at laboratory angles of $\theta$$_{lab}$$\approx$3$^\circ$,
10$^\circ$ and 18$^\circ$, respectively. Five resonances at $E_{x}$=6.15, 6.28,
6.35, 6.85, and 7.05 MeV were observed in the excitation functions, and their
spin-parities have been determined based on an $R$-matrix analysis. In
particular, $J^{\pi}$=1$^-$ was firmly assigned to the 6.15-MeV state which
dominates the thermonuclear $^{14}$O($\alpha$,$p$)$^{17}$F rate below 2 GK. As
well, a possible new excited state in $^{18}$Ne was observed at

the analog state of the 6.880 MeV (0$^{-}$) level in the mirror nucleus

determined, and the astrophysical impact of multiple recent rates has been
examined using an XRB model. Contrary to previous expectations, we find only

take into consideration the changes induced by stellar evolution on the number
of massive stars, the number of ionizing photons and the integrated mechanical
luminosity of the star forming regions. The latter is at all times compared
with the critical luminosity that defines, for a given size, the lower
mechanical luminosity limit above which the matter reinserted via strong winds
and supernova explosions suffers frequent and recurrent thermal instabilities
that reduce its temperature and pressure and inhibit its exit as part of a
global wind. Instead, the unstable reinserted matter is compressed by the
pervasive hot gas, and photoionization maintains its temperature at T $\sim$
10$^4$ K. As the evolution proceeds, more unstable matter accumulates and the
unstable clumps grow in size. Here we evaluate the possible self-shielding of
thermally unstable clumps against the UV radiation field. Self shielding allows
for a further compression of the reinserted matter which rapidly develops a
high density neutral core able to absorb in its outer skin the incoming UV
radiation. Under such conditions the cold (T $\sim$ 10 K) neutral cores soon
surpass the Jeans limit and become gravitationally unstable, causing a new
stellar generation with the matter reinserted by former massive stars. We
present the results of several calculations of this positive star formation
feedback scenario promoted by strong radiative cooling and mass loading.

dynamics still pose challenges of fundamental and technological importance. A
recent extensive compilation of multiple-source experimental data has revealed
that velocity-strengthening friction, where the steady-state frictional
resistance increases with sliding velocity over some range, is a generic
feature of such interfaces. Moreover, velocity-strengthening friction has very
recently been linked to slow laboratory earthquakes and stick-slip motion. Here
we elucidate the importance of velocity-strengthening friction by theoretically
studying three variants of a realistic rate-and-state friction model. All
variants feature identical logarithmic velocity-weakening friction at small
sliding velocities, but differ in their higher velocity behaviors. By
quantifying energy partition (e.g. radiation and dissipation), the selection of
interfacial rupture fronts and rupture arrest, we show that the presence or
absence of velocity-strengthening friction can significantly affect the global
interfacial resistance and the total energy released during frictional
instabilities (""event magnitude""). Furthermore, we show that different forms of
velocity-strengthening friction (e.g. logarithmic vs. linear) may result in
events of similar magnitude, yet with dramatically different dissipation and
radiation rates. This happens because the events are mediated by interfacial
rupture fronts with vastly different propagation velocities, where stronger
velocity-strengthening friction promotes slower rupture. These theoretical
results may have significant implications on our understanding of frictional
dynamics.

would require alternative explanations, e.g., free-free absorption, or
non-standard energy distribution of relativistic electrons which differs from a
power-law (e.g., Maxwellian).
  The search was carried out by comparing two sensitive low-frequency radio

star 4CVn revealed 18 independent oscillation frequencies, including radial as
well as non-radial p-modes of low spherical degree l<=2. From 2008 to 2011,
more than 2000 spectra were obtained at the 2.1-m Otto-Struve telescope at the
McDonald Observatory. We present the analysis of the line-profile variations,
based on the Fourier-parameter fit method, detected in the absorption lines of
4CVn, which carry clear signatures of the pulsations. From a non-sinusoidal,
periodic variation of the radial velocities, we discovered that 4CVn is an
eccentric binary system, with an orbital period Porb = 124.44 +/- 0.03 d and an
eccentricity e = 0.311 +/- 0.003. We firmly detect 20 oscillation frequencies,
9 of which are previously unseen in photometric data, and attempt mode
identification for the two dominant modes, f1 = 7.3764 c/d and f2 = 5.8496 c/d,
and determine the prograde or retrograde nature of 7 of the modes. The
projected rotational velocity of the star, vsini ~ 106.7 km/s, translates to a
rotation rate of veq/vcrit >= 33%. This relatively high rotation rate hampers
unique mode identification, since higher-order effects of rotation are not
included in the current methodology. We conclude that, in order to achieve
unambiguous mode identification for 4CVn, a complete description of rotation
and the use of blended lines have to be included in mode-identification
techniques.

  arXiv:1210.5491, arXiv:0810.2851 by other authors",,,,"astro-ph.SR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Owing to our dependance on spaceborne technology, an awareness of
disturbances in the near-Earth space environment is proving to be increasingly
crucial. Earth-directed Coronal mass ejections (CMEs) emanating from the Sun
are the primary drivers of space weather disturbances. Studies of CMEs, their
kinematics, and their near-Earth effects are therefore gaining in importance.
  The effect of CMEs near the Earth is often manifested as transient decreases
in galactic cosmic ray intensity, which are called Forbush decreases (FDs). In
this thesis we probe the structure of CMEs and their associated shocks using FD
observations by the GRAPES-3 muon telescope at Ooty. We have established that
the cumulative diffusion of galactic cosmic rays into the CME is the dominant
mechanism for causing FDs (Chapter 3).
  This diffusion takes place through a turbulent sheath region between the CME
and the shock. One of our main results concerns the turbulence level in this
region. We have quantitatively established that cross-field diffusion aided by
magnetic field turbulence accounts for the observed lag between the FD and the
magnetic field enhancement of the sheath region (Chapter 4 ).
  We have also investigated the nature of the driving forces acting on CMEs in
this thesis. Using CME data from the SECCHI coronagraphs aboard STEREO
sapcecraft, we have found evidence for the non-force-free nature of the
magnetic field configuration inside these CMEs, which is the basis for the
(often-invoked) Lorentz self-force driving (Chapter 5).
  Taken together the work presented in this thesis is a comprehensive attempt
to characterise CME propagation from typical coronagraph fields of view to the
Earth.

offline process control in steel industry is discussed. While constitutive
models are still state-of-the-art for online process control, mesoscale models
with a spatial representation of the microstructure can provide better

a new approach based on modeling the interaction of an ensemble of multiple

  Dispatch Problem With Valve-Point Effect","8 pages",,,,"math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Optimal distribution of power among generating units to meet a specific
demand subject to system constraints is an ongoing research topic in the power
system community. The problem, even in a static setting, turns out to be hard
to solve with conventional optimization methods owing to the consideration of
valve-point effects which make the cost function nonsmooth and nonconvex. This
difficulty gave rise to the proliferation of population-based global heuristics
in order to address the multi-extremal and nonsmooth problem. In this paper, we
address the economic load dispatch problem (ELDP) with valve-point effect in
its classic formulation where the cost function for each generator is expressed
as the sum of a quadratic term and a rectified sine term. We propose two
methods that resort to piecewise-quadratic surrogate cost functions, yielding
surrogate problems that can be handled by mixed-integer quadratic programming
(MIQP) solvers. The first method shows that the global solution of the ELDP can
often be found by using a fixed and very limited number of quadratic pieces in
the surrogate cost function. The second method adaptively builds
piecewise-quadratic surrogate under-estimations of the ELDP cost function,
yielding a sequence of surrogate MIQP problems. It is shown that any limit
point of the sequence of MIQP solutions is a global solution of the ELDP.
Moreover, numerical experiments indicate that the proposed methods outclass the
state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of minimization value and computation time
on practical instances.

as the model system, extending its analysis of non-standard interaction effects
at the detector to include the generally allowed non-standard interaction phase
at the detector and both non-universal and flavor changing new physics at the
reactor source. We confirm that the current data allows for new physics
constraints at the detector of the same order as those currently published, but
we find that constraints on the source new physics are at least an order of

in the 90% C.L. contour plots but not significantly affecting the conclusions.
Based on projected increase in sensitivity with an upgraded TEXONO experiment,
we estimate the improvement of sensitivity to both source and detector
non-standard interactions. We find that the bounds on source parameters improve

limits. On the other hand, the detector new physics sensitivity would push
current limits by factors 5 to 10 smaller.

eventually will supersede most other stellar catalogues in accuracy and
completeness. It is, however, lim- ited to observations from magnitude 6 to 20
and will therefore not include the brightest stars. Nano-JASMINE, an ultrasmall
Japanese astrometry satellite, will observe these bright stars, but with much
lower accuracy. Hence, the Hipparcos catalogue from 1997 will likely remain the
main source of accurate distances to bright nearby stars. We are investigating
how this might be improved by optimally combining data from all three missions
in a joint astrometric solu- tion. This would take advantage of the unique
features of each mission: the historic bright-star measurements of Hipparcos,
the updated bright-star observations of Nano-JASMINE, and the very accurate
reference frame of Gaia. The long temporal baseline between the missions pro-
vides additional benefits for the determination of proper motions and binary
detection, which indirectly improve the parallax determination further. We
present a quantitative analysis of the expected gains based on simulated data
for all three missions.

perfect destructive interference of light in micro and nano structures. One
refers to optical structures where the effective absorption can be controlled
and maximized to perfect absorption. The reported effects depend crucially on
the coherent nature of the exciting radiation. Achieved with a single (two or
more) incident plane wave (waves) the effect carries the name of critical
coupling (coherent perfect absorption). Thus in a system supporting critical
coupling (CC) or coherent perfect absorption (CPA) all the incident radiation
can be absorbed leading to null scattering. In particular all the incident
light energy can be channeled into a specified mode of a multimodal structure
if such modes are supported by the system. We present a brief overview of CC
and CPA in linear systems to recount their underlying concepts as time-reversed
lasing and some of their futuristic applications. Next we review our work on
the nonlinear extensions of CC and CPA where one or more of the layered media
could be nonlinear with Kerr-type nonlinearity. The dispersive nonlinearity is
shown to offer a practical handle over the process of perfect absorption by
incident laser power. Further we show that the nonlinear periodic structure can
support gap solitons which absorbs all the incident energy and do not scatter
any light outside the hetero-guide

significantly different from networks generated through thinning of the perfect

relationship exists between every pair of individuals). These results pertain
to global structure of the networks, which contrasts with the previous studies
inspecting frequencies of different types of triads. In addition, the

motivated by recent claims that the observed temperature anisotropy of the

Compact WENO reconstruction of Levy, Puppo and Russo (SIAM J. Sci. Comput.,
2001), thus obtaining a truly two-dimensional non-oscillatory third order
reconstruction with a very compact stencil and that does not involve
mesh-dependent coefficients. This latter characteristic is quite valuable for
its use in h-adaptive numerical schemes, since in such schemes the coefficients
that depend on the disposition and sizes of the neighboring cells (and that are
present in many existing WENO-like reconstructions) would need to be recomputed
after every mesh adaption.
  In the second part of the paper we propose a third order h-adaptive scheme
with the above-mentioned reconstruction, an explicit third order TVD
Runge-Kutta scheme and the entropy production error indicator proposed by Puppo
and Semplice (Commun. Comput. Phys., 2011). After devising some heuristics on
the choice of the parameters controlling the mesh adaption, we demonstrate with
many numerical tests that the scheme can compute numerical solution whose error
decays as $\langle N\rangle^{-3}$, where $\langle N\rangle$ is the average
number of cells used during the computation, even in the presence of shock
waves, by making a very effective use of h-adaptivity and the proposed third
order reconstruction.

(tracking) functional for surface shape with the prescribed mean curvature
equation in graph form as a state constraint. The control variable is the
prescribed curvature. We prove existence of an optimal control, and using
improved regularity estimates, we show sufficient differentiability to make
sense of the first order optimality conditions. This allows us to rigorously
compute the gradient of the objective functional for both the continuous and

error estimates for the state variable and adjoint state. Numerical results are
shown to illustrate the minimizers and optimal controls on different domains.

an application of these solutions, we use the AdS/CFT correspondence to study
the approach to equilibrium of the entanglement entropy and of the boundary

distribution is generally considered to be a nuisance to weak gravitational
lensing. Measurements of cosmological parameters are affected as feedback
alters the cosmic shear signal on angular scales smaller than a few arcminutes.
Recent progress on the numerical modelling of baryon physics has shown that
this effect could be so large that, rather than being a nuisance, the effect
can be constrained with current weak lensing surveys, hence providing an
alternative astrophysical insight on one of the most challenging questions of
galaxy formation. In order to perform our analysis, we construct an analytic
fitting formula that describes the effect of the baryons on the mass power
spectrum. This fitting formula is based on three scenarios of the OWL
hydrodynamical simulations. It is specifically calibrated for $z<1.5$, where it
models the simulations to an accuracy that is better than $2\%$ for scales
$k<10 h\mbox{Mpc}^{-1}$ and better than $5\%$ for $10 < k < 100
h\mbox{Mpc}^{-1}$. Equipped with this precise tool, this paper presents the
first constraint on baryonic feedback models using gravitational lensing data,
from the Canada France Hawaii Telescope Lensing Survey (CFHTLenS). In this
analysis, we show that the effect of neutrino mass on the mass power spectrum
is degenerate with the baryonic feedback at small angular scales and cannot be
ignored. Assuming a cosmology precision fixed by WMAP9, we find that a universe
with no baryon feedback and massless neutrinos is rejected by the CFHTLenS
lensing data with 96\% confidence. Our study shows that ongoing weak
gravitational lensing surveys (KiDS, HSC and DES) will offer a unique
opportunity to probe the physics of baryons at galactic scales, in addition to
the expected constraints on the total neutrino mass.

equations admit Noether symmetries. In the second case, the Lagrangian reduces
to a Brans-Dicke-like theory with a general coupling function. For each case,
it is possible to transform the field equations by using normal coordinates to

Then we consider the problem of equipartition of energy in the spirit of

$0<R\ll 1$, and with only the first Fourier mode excited, the energy remains
forever in a packet of Fourier modes exponentially decreasing with the wave
number. Finally we consider the original FPU model and prove that energy
remains localized in a similar packet of Fourier modes for times one order of

formation of the packet. The proof of the theorem on Birkhoff coordinates is
based on a new quantitative version of a Vey type theorem by Kuksin and

persistent directionality. Different theoretical approaches have been suggested
in order to explore the origin of this kind of motion. An effective theoretical

tug-of-war between different kinds of motors. An alternative approach has been
suggested recently by Kunwar et al., who considered the coupling between motor

where V and W are vector spaces over a field of characteristic 0. This
characterization is done in terms of a polytope constructed from the set of
Young diagrams corresponding to the Schur modules generating the ideal.
  Our approach consists in computing the test ideals of some invariant ideals
of S in positive characteristic: Namely, we will compute the test ideals (and
so the F-pure thresholds) of any sum of products of determinantal ideals. Even
in characteristic 0, not all the invariant ideals are as the latter, but they
are up to integral closure, and this is enough to reach our goals.
  The results concerning the test ideals are obtained as a consequence of
general results holding true in a special situation. Within such framework fall
determinantal objects of a generic matrix, as well as of a symmetric matrix and
of a skew-symmetric one. Similar results are thus deduced for the
GL(V)-invariant ideals in the symmetric algebra of the second symmetric (or
alternating) power of V. (Also monomial ideals fall in this framework, thus we
recover Howald's formula for their multiplier ideals and, more generally, we
get the formula for their test ideals). During the proof, we introduce the
notion of ""floating test ideals"", a property that in a sense is satisfied by
ideals defining schemes with singularities as nice as possible. As we will see,
products of determinantal ideals, and by passing to characteristic 0 ideals
generated by a single Schur module, have this property.

examined. Instabilities are presented for several classes of models, and simple
criteria for the cosmological stability of massive bigravity are derived. In
this way, we identify a particular self-accelerating bigravity model,
infinite-branch bigravity (IBB), which exhibits both viable background
evolution and stable linear perturbations. We discuss the modified gravity
parameters for IBB, which do not reduce to the standard $\Lambda$CDM result at
early times, and compute the combined likelihood from measured growth data and
type Ia supernovae. IBB predicts a present matter density $\Omega_{m0}=0.18$
and an equation of state $w(z)=-0.79+0.21z/(1+z)$. The growth rate of structure
is well-approximated at late times by
$f(z)\approx\Omega_{m}^{0.47}[1+0.21z/(1+z)]$. The implications of the linear
instability for other bigravity models are discussed: the instability does not
necessarily rule these models out, but rather presents interesting questions
about how to extract observables from them when linear perturbation theory does

limited to the high temperature phase of the model. It is found that the
results are qualitatively different only in a temperature range near the glass
transition temperature $T_0$ of the exponential model. While for the Gaussian
model the choice of the dynamical variable that couples to the field has no
impact on the shape of the linear response, this is different for the
exponential model. Here, it is found that also the relaxation time strongly
depends on the variable chosen. Furthermore, the modulus of the frequency
dependent third-order response shows either a peak or exhibits a monotonuous
decay from a finite low-frequency limit to a vanishing response at high
frequencies depending on the dynamical variable. For variables that give rise
to a peak in the modulus it is found that its height either increases or
decreases as a function of temperature, again depending on the details of the
choice of the variable. The peak value of the modulus shows a scaling behavior
near $T_0$. It is found that for some variables the low-frequency limit of the
cubic response diverges at the glass transition temperature and also at a
further temperature determined by the particular variable. A recently proposed
approximation that relates the cubic response to a four-time correlation
function does not give reliable results due to a wrong estimate of the

Transcription factors can bind to the DNA and affect the gene's transcription

regulates gene activity by influencing the activity of transcription factors.
Protein is slowly removed from the system through degradation. Depending on how
the protein regulates gene activity, the protein concentration can exhibit
noise induced bistable switching. An asymptotic approximation of the mean
switching rate is derived that includes the pre exponential factor, which
improves upon a previously reported logarithmically accurate approximation.
With the improved accuracy, a uniformly accurate approximation of the

algorithm is developed in quantum computing over Z_2, symbolized QC/2, (as
opposed to QC over C) that needs only one function evaluation to solve the
Grover Database Search Problem of finding a designated record among 2^m records
for any m. In the usual Grover algorithm in quantum computing over C, one needs
essentially Sqrt(2^m) function evaluations as opposed to the average of (2^m)/2
functions evaluations needed in the classical algorithm. The one function
evaluation of the QC/2 algorithm (for any m) represents such a super speedup,
even over the Grover algorithm in QC/C, that one feels something has gone awry.
Indeed, our analysis of the transparent calculations of Boolean functions over
Z_2 shows that the classical algorithm is just repackaged in a rather obvious
way in the single function evaluation of the QC/2 algorithm--whereas the
calculations are hidden and non-transparent in the Grover QC/C algorithm using
C. The conclusion in both cases (which is rather obvious in the QC/2 case) is
that ""counting function evaluations"" is a false coin to measure speedup in the

clusters, namely MS2137, A963, A383, A611, A2537, A2667, A2390. Similarly to
Newman et al. (2012a,b), the total density profile, in the radius range 0.003 -
0.03$r_{200}$, has a mean total density profile in agreement with
dissipationless simulations. The slope of the DM profiles of all clusters is
flatter than -1. The slope, $\alpha$, has a maximum value (including errors) of
$\alpha=-0.88$ in the case of A2390, and minimum value $\alpha=-0.14$ for
A2537. The baryonic component dominates the mass distribution at radii $< 5-10$
kpc, while the outer distribution is dark matter dominated. We found an
anti-correlation among the slope $\alpha$, the effective radius, $R_e$, and the
BCG mass, and a correlation among the core radius $r_{core}$, and $R_e$.
Moreover, the mass in 100 kpc (mainly dark matter) is correlated with the mass
inside 5 kpc (mainly baryons).
  The behavior of the total mass density profile, the DM density profile, and
the quoted correlations can be understood in a double phase scenario. In the
first dissipative phase the proto-BCG forms, and in the second dissipationless
phase, dynamical friction between baryonic clumps (collapsing to the center)
and the DM halo flattens the inner slope of the density profile.
  In simple terms, the large scatter in the inner slope from cluster to
cluster, and the anti-correlation among the slope, $\alpha$ and $R_e$ is due to
the fact that in order to have a total mass density profile which is NFW-like,
clusters having more massive BCGs at their centers must contain less DM in
their center. Consequently the inner profile has a flatter slope.

the thermal dependence of the two most intense magnetic excitation at

One particularly unique and valuable aspect of this type of modeling technique
is the ability to explicitly implement models for the bicontinuous
nanostructured morphology present in these devices. For this purpose, an
Ising-based method for creating model BHJ morphologies has become prevalent.
However, this technique can be computationally expensive, and a detailed
characterization of this method has not yet been published. Here, we perform a
thorough characterization of this method and describe how to efficiently
generate controlled model BHJ morphologies. We show how the interaction energy
affects the tortuosity of the interconnected domains and the resulting charge
transport behavior in KMC simulations. We also demonstrate how to dramatically
reduce calculation time by several orders of magnitude without detrimentally
affecting the resulting morphologies. In the end, we propose standard
conditions for generating model morphologies and introduce a new open-source
software tool. These developments to the Ising method provide a strong
foundation for future simulation and modeling of BHJ organic photovoltaic
devices that will lead to a more detailed understanding of the important link
between morphological features and device performance.

coronene. To develop the methods we focus on integrating out the van-der-Waals
and intramolecular interactions, while electrostatic charge contributions are
neglected. The resulting coarse-grained pair potential reveals a strong
temperature and angle dependence. In the next step we fit the numerical data
with various Gay-Berne-like potentials to be used in more efficient simulations
on larger scales. The quality of the resulting coarse-grained results is
evaluated by comparing their pair and many-body structure as well as some
thermodynamic quantities self-consistently to the outcome of atomistic MD
simulations of many-particle systems. We find that angle-resolved potentials
are essential not only to accurately describe crystal structures but also for
fluid systems where simple isotropic potentials start to fail already for low
to moderate packing fractions. Further, in describing these states it is
crucial to take into account the pronounced temperature dependence arising in
selected pair configurations due to bending fluctuations.

in these hot spots are fired and, as a result, complex pattern of cavitation
bubbles is created. The bubbles can be isolated from each other or build exotic

maximum usage, while the usage-based pricing can flexibly attract more users

theoretical analysis to compare the two schemes and show that for a single
provider in a market, as long as the WiFi capacity is abundant, the flat-rate
pricing leads to more revenue. Second, we study how a global provider (e.g.,
Skype) collaborates with this monopolist in each local market to provide a
global WiFi service. We formulate {the interactions between the global and
local providers as a dynamic game. In Stage I, the global provider bargains
with the local provider in each market to determine the global WiFi service
price and revenue sharing agreement. In Stage II, local users and travelers
choose local or global WiFi services. We analytically show that the global
provider prefers to use the usage-based pricing to avoid a severe competition
with the local provider. At the equilibrium, the global provider always shares
the majority of his revenue with the local provider to incentivize the
cooperation. Finally, we analytically study how the interaction changes if the
local market has more than one local provider. In this case, the global
provider can integrate the coverages of multiple local providers and provide a
better service. Compared to the local monopoly case, local market competition
enables the global provider to share less revenue with each of the local
providers. However, we numerically show that the global provider's revenue
could decrease, as he shares his revenue with more providers and can only
charge a lower price.

systems. Despite recent progress in this area, reconstructing networks with
stochastic dynamical processes from limited time series remains to be an
outstanding problem. Here we develop a framework based on compressed sensing to
reconstruct complex networks on which stochastic spreading dynamics take place.
We apply the methodology to a large number of model and real networks, finding
that a full reconstruction of inhomogeneous interactions can be achieved from
small amounts of polarized (binary) data, a virtue of compressed sensing.
Further, we demonstrate that a hidden source that triggers the spreading
process but is externally inaccessible can be ascertained and located with high
confidence in the absence of direct routes of propagation from it. Our approach
thus establishes a paradigm for tracing and controlling epidemic invasion and
information diffusion in complex networked systems.

has been found and solved. The put-call parity has been proved and the Greeks
have been calculated. Three additional new Greeks associated with market model

diffusion approximation the developed option pricing model incorporates the
well-known Black-Scholes equation and its solution. The stochastic dynamic
origin of the Black-Scholes volatility has been uncovered. The new option
pricing model has been generalized based on asset price dynamics modeled by the
superposition of Geometric Brownian motion and Geometric Shot Noise. To model
stochastic dynamics of a short term interest rate, the second model has been
introduced and developed based on Langevin type equation with shot noise. A new
bond pricing formula has been obtained. It has been shown that in diffusion
approximation the developed bond pricing formula goes into the well-known
Vasicek solution. The stochastic dynamic origin of the long-term mean and
instantaneous volatility of the Vasicek model has been uncovered. A generalized
bond pricing model has been introduced and developed based on short term
interest rate stochastic dynamics modeled by superposition of a standard Wiener
process and shot noise. Despite the non-Gaussianity of probability
distributions involved, all newly elaborated models have the same degree of
analytical tractability as the Black-Scholes model and the Vasicek model.

the opened cage (fulleroid) structure by addition of OPE on the [6,6] position
of the fullerene cages. There was no considerable charge transfer between OPE
and fullerene cage, but the fullerene cages had the remarkable minus charges
mainly due to the electron transfer from RE3N to the cage. The calculated
electronic spectra showed that light absorption bands of OPE-C80 were more
red-shifted than that of OPE-RE3N@C80 and all of OPE-RE3N@C80 seem to have a
couple of Vis-NIR absorption peaks.

Harada and Tsutsui, we show that the Proca and the Chiral Schwinger models may
both be viewed as gauge-fixed versions of genuinely gauge- invariant models.
This leads to the proposal that any consistent Abelian vector model with no
gauge symmetry can be understood as a gauge theory that had its gauge fixed,
which establishes an equivalence between gauge-invariant and non
gauge-invariant models. Finally, we show that a gauge-invariant version of the
chiral Schwinger model, after integrating out the fermionic degrees of freedom,
can be identified with the two-dimensional Stueckelberg model without the gauge
fixing term.

symmetries, including Lorentz and gauge invariance without appeal to any
fundamental invariance of the laws of nature, and to derive the known physical
laws in such a way as to be almost unavoidable. C. D. Froggatt and H. B.
Nielsen proposed in their book Origin of Symmetries, that symmetries and
physical laws should arise naturally from some essentially random dynamics
rather than being postulated to be exact. The most useful assumption of the
program that can be made about the fundamental laws is taken to be that they
are random and then to see how known physics like mechanics and relativity
follow from them. It is believed that almost any model of these regularities
would appear in some limit for example as energies become small. Almost all
theories or models at the fundamental level could then explain known physics.
  We suggest how using the formalism and properties of random graphs might be
useful in developing the theory, and point towards directions in which it can
be more fully extended in future work.

injection via the use of dynamically polarized nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in
diamond. We focus on the geometry where carriers and NV centers are confined to
proximate, parallel layers and use a 'trap-and-release' model to calculate the
spin cross-relaxation probabilities between the charge carriers and neighboring
NV centers. We identify near-unity regimes of carrier polarization depending on
the NV spin state, applied magnetic field, and carrier g-factor. In particular,
we find that unlike holes, electron spins are distinctively robust against
spin-lattice relaxation by other, unpolarized paramagnetic centers. Further,
the polarization process is only weakly dependent on the carrier hopping
dynamics, which makes this approach potentially applicable over a broad range
of temperatures.
