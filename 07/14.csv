Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) superfluids has been hindered by
various challenges, in particular, the requirement of low dimensional systems.
In 2D, finite temperature phase fluctuations lead to extremely small
Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition temperature for FFLO
superfluids, raising serious concerns regarding their experimental
observability. Recently, it was shown that FFLO superfluids can be realized
using a Rashba spin-orbit coupled Fermi gas subject to Zeeman fields, which may
also support topological excitations such as Majorana fermions in 2D. Here we
address the finite temperature BKT transition issue in this system, which may
exhibit gapped, gapless, topological, and gapless topological FF phases. We
find a large BKT transition temperature due to large effective superfluid
densities, making it possible to observe 2D FF superfluids at finite
temperature. In addition, we show that gapless FF superfluids can be stable due
to their positive superfluid densities. These findings pave the way for the
experimental observation of 2D gapped and gapless FF superfluids and their
associated topological excitations at finite temperature.

a tedious, repetitive, isolated and time consuming process. In order to
automate, simplify and systematize program optimization and architecture
design, we are developing open-source modular plugin-based Collective Tuning
Infrastructure (CTI, http://cTuning.org) that can distribute optimization
process and leverage optimization experience of multiple users. CTI provides a
novel fully integrated, collaborative, ""one button"" approach to improve
existing underperfoming computing systems ranging from embedded architectures
to high-performance servers based on systematic iterative compilation,
statistical collective optimization and machine learning. Our experimental
results show that it is possible to reduce execution time (and code size) of
some programs from SPEC2006 and EEMBC among others by more than a factor of 2
automatically. It can also reduce development and testing time considerably.
Together with the first production quality machine learning enabled interactive
research compiler (MILEPOST GCC) this infrastructure opens up many research
opportunities to study and develop future realistic self-tuning and
self-organizing adaptive intelligent computing systems based on systematic
statistical performance evaluation and benchmarking. Finally, using common

flux injection mimics the poloidal currents driven by the anode-cathode voltage
drop in the experiment. The injected toroidal field stretches the poloidal
fields to large distances, while forming a collimated jet along with several
other key features. Detailed comparisons between 3D MHD simulations and
experimental measurements provide a comprehensive description of the interplay
among magnetic force, pressure and flow effects. In particular, we delineate
both the jet structure and the transition process that converts the injected
magnetic energy to other forms. With suitably chosen parameters that are
derived from experiments, the jet in the simulation agrees quantitatively with
the experimental jet in terms of magnetic/kinetic/inertial energy, total
poloidal current, voltage, jet radius, and jet propagation velocity.
Specifically, the jet velocity in the simulation is proportional to the
poloidal current divided by the square root of the jet density, in agreement
with both the experiment and analytical theory. This work provides a new and
quantitative method for relating experiments, numerical simulations and
astrophysical observation, and demonstrates the possibility of using
terrestrial laboratory experiments to study astrophysical jets.

statistically validated by differential fluorescence recovery after

being higher in presence of SMF. This instant magneto-sensing by live cells can
be explained by inherent diamagnetic susceptibility of cells and alternatively
by spin recombination, e.g., by the radical pair mechanism. These arguments are
however insufficient to explain the retention of the SMF effect even after
field withdrawal. Typically, a relaxation time scale at least of the order of
minutes is observed. This long duration of the SMF effect can be explained
postulating a field induced coherence that is followed by decoherence after the
field withdrawal. A related observation is the emergence of enhanced magnetic
susceptibility of cells after magnetic pre-incubation. This implies onset of a
new spin equilibrium state as a result of prolonged SMF incubation. Lastly,
translation of such altered spin states to a cellular signal that leads to an
altered sub-cellular streaming, probable intracellular machineries for this
translation being discussed in the text.

quickly adapt to a wide variety of injuries, current robots cannot ""think

to their pre-specified self-sensing abilities, can diagnose only anticipated
failure modes, and require a pre-programmed contingency plan for every type of
potential damage, an impracticality for complex robots. Here we introduce an
intelligent trial and error algorithm that allows robots to adapt to damage in
less than two minutes, without requiring self-diagnosis or pre-specified
contingency plans. Before deployment, a robot exploits a novel algorithm to
create a detailed map of the space of high-performing behaviors: This map
represents the robot's intuitions about what behaviors it can perform and their
value. If the robot is damaged, it uses these intuitions to guide a
trial-and-error learning algorithm that conducts intelligent experiments to
rapidly discover a compensatory behavior that works in spite of the damage.
Experiments reveal successful adaptations for a legged robot injured in five
different ways, including damaged, broken, and missing legs, and for a robotic
arm with joints broken in 14 different ways. This new technique will enable
more robust, effective, autonomous robots, and suggests principles that animals

star formation rate (SFR) occurring in nuclear rings of barred-spiral galaxies.
We find that spiral arms can be an efficient means of gas transport from the
outskirts to the central parts, provided that the arms are rotating slower than
the bar. While the ring star formation in models with no-arm or corotating arms
is active only during about the bar growth phase, arm-driven gas accretion
makes the ring star formation both enhanced and prolonged significantly in
models with slow-rotating arms. The arm-enhanced SFR is larger by a factor of ~
3-20 than in the no-arm model, with larger values corresponding to stronger and
slower arms. Arm-induced mass inflows also make dust lanes stronger. Nuclear
rings in slow-arm models are ~ 45% larger than in the no-arm counterparts. Star
clusters that form in a nuclear ring exhibit an age gradient in the azimuthal
direction only when the SFR is small, whereas no noticeable age gradient is
found in the radial direction for models with arm-induced star formation.

whether the light curve of SN 1998bw can be used as a representative template
or whether there is a luminosity-decline rate relation akin to that of SNe Ia.
In this paper, we aim to obtain well-constrained light curves of GRB-SNe
without the assumption of empirical or parametric templates and to investigate
whether the peak brightness correlates with other parameters such as the light
curve shape or the time of peak. We select eight SNe in the redshift range
0.0085 to 0.606, which are firmly associated with GRBs. The light curves of
these GRB-SNe are well sampled across the peak. Afterglow and host galaxy
contributions are subtracted and dust reddening is corrected for. Low-order
polynomial functions are fitted to the light curves. A K-correction is applied
to transform the light curves into the rest frame V band. GRB-SNe follow a
luminosity-decline rate relation similar to the Phillips relation for SNe Ia,
with $M_{V,peak} = 1.59^{+0.28}_{-0.24} \Delta m_{V,15} -
20.61^{+0.19}_{-0.22}$, with $\chi^2 = 5.2$ for 6 dof and $M_{V,peak}$ and
$\Delta m_{V,15}$ being the peak magnitude and decline rate in V band. This
luminosity-decline rate relation is tighter than the k-s relation, where k and
s are the factors describing the relative brightness and width to the light
curve of SN 1998bw. The peak luminosities of GRB-SNe are also correlated with
the time of peak: the brighter the GRB-SN, the longer the rise time. The light
curve of SN 1998bw stretched around the time of explosion can be used as a
template for GRB-SNe with reasonable confidence, but stretching around the peak
produces better results. The existence of such a relation provides a new
constraint on GRB explosion models. GRB-SNe can be used as standardizable
candles to measure cosmological distances and constrain cosmological
parameters.

continuous scalar order parameter field is discussed, which provides a
convenient representation of the interface between locally crystal-like and
locally liquid-like regions. A number of interfacial properties are
straightforwardly evaluated using this procedure such as the average premelting
thickness and surface tension. The temperature and system size dependence of
the premelting layer thickness calculated in this way confirms the
characteristic logarithmic growth expected for the scalar field theory that the
system is mapped onto through coarse-graining, though remains finite due to
long-ranged interactions. Finally, from explicit simulations the existence of a

network flows. In the proposed model, the network state consists of flows and
activation status of the links. Network dynamics is determined by a, possibly
state-dependent and adversarial, disturbance process that reduces flow capacity
on the links, and routing policies at the nodes that have access to the network
state, but are oblivious to the presence of disturbance. Under the proposed
dynamics, a link becomes irreversibly inactive either due to overload condition
on itself or on all of its immediate downstream links. The coupling between
link activation and flow dynamics implies that links to become inactive
successively are not necessarily adjacent to each other, and hence the pattern
of cascading failure under our model is qualitatively different than standard
cascade models. The magnitude of a disturbance process is defined as the sum of
cumulative capacity reductions across time and links of the network, and the
margin of resilience of the network is defined as the infimum over the
magnitude of all disturbance processes under which the links at the origin node
become inactive. We propose an algorithm to compute an upper bound on the
margin of resilience for the setting where the routing policy only has access
to information about the local state of the network. For the limiting case when
the routing policies update their action as fast as network dynamics, we
identify sufficient conditions on network parameters under which the upper
bound is tight under an appropriate routing policy. Our analysis relies on
making connections between network parameters and monotonicity in network state
evolution under proposed dynamics.

nanoscale devices have led to an intense research effort dedicated to the
demonstration and application of this nonlinearity in on-chip systems. The key
feature of SBS in integrated photonic waveguides is that small, high-contrast
waveguides are predicted to experience powerful optical forces on the waveguide
boundaries, which are predicted to further boost the SBS gain that is already
expected to grow dramatically in such structures because of the higher mode
confinement alone. In all recent treatments, the effect of radiation pressure
is included separately from the scattering action that the acoustic field
exerts on the optical field. In contrast to this, we show here that the effects
of radiation pressure and motion of the waveguide boundaries are inextricably
linked. Central to this insight is a new formulation of the SBS interaction
that unifies the treatment of light and sound, incorporating all relevant
interaction mechanisms --- radiation pressure, waveguide boundary motion,
electrostriction and photoelasticity --- from a rigorous thermodynamic
perspective. Our approach also clarifies important points of ambiguity in the
literature, such as the nature of edge-effects with regard to electrostriction,
and of body-forces with respect to radiation pressure. This new perspective on
Brillouin processes leads to physical insight with implications for the design
and fabrication of SBS-based nanoscale devices.

cluster around the super massive black hole, we use the particle number and the
tidal radius of black hole as free parameters for a scaling analysis. The
transition from full to empty loss-cone is analyzed in our data, the tidal
disruption rate scales with the particle number $N$ in the expected way for
both cases. For the first time in numerical simulations (under certain
conditions) we can support the concept of a critical radius of Frank & Rees
(1976), which claims that most stars are tidally accreted on highly eccentric
orbits originating from regions far outside the tidal radius. Due to the
consumption of stars moving on radial orbits, a velocity anisotropy is founded
inside the cluster. Finally we make an estimation for the real galactic center
based on our simulation results and the scaling analysis.

urban scenery and is hazardous to human health and the environment. Current
monitoring devices are limited in measuring average PM over large areas.
Quantifying the visual effects of haze in digital images of urban scenery and
correlating these effects to PM levels is a vital step in more practically
monitoring our environment. Current image haze extraction algorithms remove
haze from the scene for the sole purpose of enhancing vision. We present two
algorithms which bridge the gap between image haze extraction and environmental
monitoring. We provide a means of measuring atmospheric scattering from images
of urban scenery by incorporating temporal knowledge. In doing so, we also
present a method of recovering an accurate depthmap of the scene and recovering
the scene without the visual effects of haze. We compare our algorithm to three
known haze removal methods. The algorithms are composed of an optimization over
a model of haze formation in images and an optimization using a constraint of
constant depth over a sequence of images taken over time. These algorithms not
only measure atmospheric scattering, but also recover a more accurate depthmap
and dehazed image. The measurements of atmospheric scattering this research
produces, can be directly correlated to PM levels and therefore pave the way to
monitoring the health of the environment by visual means. Accurate atmospheric
sensing from digital images is a challenging and under-researched problem. This
work provides an important step towards a more practical and accurate visual
means of measuring PM from digital images.

brane-world cosmology. Brane-world cosmological effects alter the inflationary
predictions of the spectral index ($n_s$) and the tensor-to-scalar ratio ($r$)
from those obtained in the standard cosmology. In particular, the
tensor-to-scalar ratio is enhanced in the presence of the 5th dimension, and
simple inflationary models which predict small $r$ values in the standard
cosmology can yield $r$ values being compatible with the BICEP2 result,
$r=0.2^{+0.07}_{-0.05}$. Confirmation of the BICEP2 result and more precise
measurements of $n_s$ and $r$ in the near future allow us to constrain the
5-dimensional Planck mass ($M_5$) of the brane-world scenario. We also discuss
the post inflationary scenario, namely, reheating of the universe through
inflaton decay to the Standard Model particles. When we require the
renormalizability of the inflationary models, the inflaton only couples with
the Higgs doublet among the Standard Model fields, through which reheating
process occurs. If $M_5$ is as low as $10^6$ GeV, the mass of inflaton becomes
of ${\cal O}$(100 GeV), providing the inflationary predictions being consistent
with the BICEP2 and Planck results. Such a light inflaton has some impacts on
phenomenology at the electroweak scale through the coupling with the Higgs
doublet.

blowing pressure gradually increases through time, the oscillations appear at a
much higher value, called dynamic oscillation threshold, than what is predicted
in the static case. This is known as bifurcation delay, a phenomenon studied in
[1,2] for a clarinet model. In particular the dynamic oscillation threshold is
predicted analytically when the blowing pressure is linearly increased.
However, the mouth pressure cannot grow indefinitely. During a note attack,
after an increasing phase, the musician stabilizes the mouth pressure. In the
present work, the analytical prediction of the dynamic oscillation threshold is
extended to a situations in which the mouth pressure approaches a steady state
pressure according to an exponential time profile. The predictions still show a
good agreement with simulation of the simple clarinet-model. This situation is

frequently encountered in biological and microfluidic systems. In 2D systems,
at sufficiently high surface coverage, diffusive motion is widely known to be
strongly affected by physical confinement, e.g., by the walls. In this Letter,
we explore the effects of confinement by shape, not rigid boundaries, on the
diffusion of particles by confining them to the surface of a cylinder. We find
that both the magnitude and the directionality of lateral diffusion is strongly
influenced by the radius of the cylinder. An anisotropy between diffusion in
the longitudinal and circumferential direction of the cylinder develops. We
demonstrate that the origin of this effect lies in the fact that screw-like
packings of mono- and oligodisperse discs on the surface of a cylinder induce
preferential collective motions in the circumferential direction, but also show
that even in polydisperse systems lacking such order an intrinsic finite size
confinement effect increases diffusivity in the circumferential direction.

more detailed and precise effort. The science would be to measure the
large-scale structure on the size of the baryon acoustic oscillations and
larger scale, and the results would be complementary to its contemporary

preconditions of overcoming of relativistic intentions in modern philosophy of
science (""there are no any general foundations in philosophy of science""). We
found two general foundations in philosophy of science as a minimum. From the
first side it's realistic to reveal on the base of special understanding of
time the value of time not only in natural thought (especially in theory of
gravity) but also in humanitarian knowledge. That's why philosophy of science
has independent position in epistemology and ontology corresponding to
interpretation of time as a general category of scientific thinking. The nature
of time has internally inconsistent (paradoxical) character. Time is phenomenon
which existing and not existing at the same time. This phenomenon is identified
with imaginary movement and also ideal (formal) process of formation of the
nature. The general understanding of time is connected with its ""mathematical""
meaning as calculable formal regulation of language practice and also the
universal organization rules of quantitative parameters of intelligence of
natural (physical) processes. From the second side we can say that exist an
actual branch of philosophy of science. It exists on the basis of disclosure of
aprioristic limits of consciousness of its cultural and historical development.
There is possible a special interpretation of time. In that context time is the
connection of an action of the cultural phenomenon or its ""energy"" with some
kind of ""weight"", the historical importance of a separate limit of
consciousness through analog of ""distance"" as intensity of cultural and
historical space (or ""oppositional nature of interaction of mental
intentions"").

accumulated during plastic deformation of metals. A new model of
phenomenological metal plasticity is proposed which is suitable for
applications involving large deformations of workpiece material. The model
takes combined nonlinear isotropic/kinematic hardening, strain-driven damage
and rate-dependence of the stress response into account. Within this model, the
work hardening and the damage evolution are fully coupled. The description of
the kinematics is based on the double multiplicative decomposition of the
deformation gradient proposed by Lion. An additional multiplicative
decomposition is introduced in order to account for the damage-induced volume
increase of the material. The model is formulated in a thermodynamically
admissible manner. Within a simple example of the proposed framework, the
material porosity is adopted as a rough measure of damage.
  A new simple void nucleation rule is formulated based on the consideration of
various nucleation mechanisms. In particular, this rule is suitable for
materials which exhibit a higher void nucleation rate under torsion than in
case of tension.
  The material model is implemented into the FEM code Abaqus and a simulation
of a deep drawing process is presented. The robustness of the algorithm and the
performance of the formulation is demonstrated.

the conventional ($\nu_\mu+\bar\nu_\mu$) and ($\nu_e+\bar\nu_e$) energy

transition from the atmospheric electron neutrino flux to the predominance of

defined in a finite box, the presence of the boundary induces an interaction,

box. On the other hand, the contour cannot cross the boundary, so it feels
entropic repulsion from it. In various situations of interest a crucial
technical problem is to prove that entropic repulsion prevails over the pinning
interaction: in particular, the contour-boundary interaction should not modify
significantly the contour partition function and the related surface tension
should be unchanged. Here we prove that this is indeed the case, at least at
sufficiently low temperature, in a quite general framework that applies in

improved direct fermionic PIMC simulations that are exptected to be more
accurate than RPIMC at high densities.

The bending rigidity and projected area increase with the membrane charge

lipid charges. While the monovalent counterions only weakly screen the Coulomb
interactions, which implies a repulsive Coulomb system, the multivalent
counterions condense on the membrane and, through spatial charge correlations,
make the effective interactions due the charged lipids attractive. The
differences in the elastic properties of the charged membranes in monovalent

isolated ensemble of strongly interacting atoms spatially confined to the
blockade volume - a so-called superatom. Here we demonstrate the controlled
creation and characterization of an isolated mesoscopic superatom by means of
accurate density engineering and excitation to Rydberg $p$-states. Its variable
size allows to investigate the transition from effective two-level physics for
strong confinement to many-body phenomena in extended systems. By monitoring
continuous laser-induced ionization we observe a strongly anti-bunched ion
emission under blockade conditions and extremely bunched ion emission under
off-resonant excitation. Our experimental setup enables in vivo measurements of
the superatom, yielding insight into both excitation statistics and dynamics.

features. In the two first cases, the states will be constructed in static and
in cosmological spacetimes. In one of the cases, the states will be constructed
in such a way as to minimize the expectation value of the energy-momentum
tensor of a free massive scalar field, multiplied by a suitable smooth function
of compact support, in a cosmological spacetime. The final form of the state
clearly reduces to the vacuum in a static spacetime. Besides, we will show that
these are Hadamard states. They do not contradict the above mentioned
nonexistence of a unique prescription because they depend on the chosen smooth
function. In the other case, we will calculate the positive part of the
spectral decomposition of the commutator function in a specific subset of the
spacetime and will show that, in static and in cosmological spacetimes, the
kernel of this function, once again multiplied by a suitable smooth function of
compact support, corresponds to the kernel of Hadamard states. In both cases,
the construction of the states does not rely on invariance under the action of
a group of symmetries. Such a group may not even exist, in these cases.
  In the last case we will construct a state in the Schwarzschild-de Sitter
spacetime, which describes a universe with a black hole and a cosmological
constant. This state is invariant under the action of the group of symmetries
of this spacetime, although it is not defined in its whole Kruskal extension.
In this way, we avoid the situation in which the authors of (KayWald91) showed
that a Hadamard state cannot exist. We will show that the state we construct is
Hadamard and that it is not thermal, differently from the case of states
constructed in spacetimes containing only one event horizon

ground-state cooling of the mechanical oscillator with room temperature thermal

from missing data and propose adaptive sampling procedures for both problems.
We show that adaptive sampling allows one to eliminate standard incoherence
assumptions on the matrix row space that are necessary for passive sampling
procedures. For exact recovery of a low-rank matrix, our algorithm judiciously
selects a few columns to observe in full and, with few additional measurements,
projects the remaining columns onto their span. This algorithm exactly recovers
an $n \times n$ rank $r$ matrix using $O(nr\mu_0 \log^2(r))$ observations,
where $\mu_0$ is a coherence parameter on the column space of the matrix. In
addition to completely eliminating any row space assumptions that have pervaded
the literature, this algorithm enjoys a better sample complexity than any
existing matrix completion algorithm. To certify that this improvement is due
to adaptive sampling, we establish that row space coherence is necessary for
passive sampling algorithms to achieve non-trivial sample complexity bounds.
  For constructing a low-rank approximation to a high-rank input matrix, we
propose a simple algorithm that thresholds the singular values of a zero-filled
version of the input matrix. The algorithm computes an approximation that is
nearly as good as the best rank-$r$ approximation using $O(nr\mu \log^2(n))$
samples, where $\mu$ is a slightly different coherence parameter on the matrix
columns. Again we eliminate assumptions on the row space.

which is measurable using transcriptome analysis. Given that a cell undergoing
steady growth is constrained to sustain each of its internal components, the
abundance of all the components in the cell has to be roughly doubled during
each cell division event. From this steady-growth constraint, expression of all
genes is shown to change along a one-parameter curve in the state space in
response to the environmental stress. This leads to a global relationship that
governs the cellular state: By considering a relatively moderate change around
a steady state, logarithmic changes in expression are shown to be proportional
across all genes, upon alteration of stress strength, with the proportionality
coefficient given by the change in the growth rate of the cell. This theory is
confirmed by transcriptome analysis of Escherichia Coli in response to several
stresses.

ordinal Turing machines or ordinal register machines without parameters and
that this is, under the assumption that $0^{\sharp}$ exists, independent of

scales large compared to those of the individual motile units. Despite
intensive experimental and theoretical study, it has remained unclear the
extent to which the hydrodynamic flows generated by swimming cells, rather than
purely steric interactions between them, drive the self-organization. Here we
utilize the recent discovery of a spiral-vortex state in confined suspensions
of \textit{B. subtilis} to study this issue in detail. Those experiments showed
that if the radius of confinement in a thin cylindrical chamber is below a
critical value the suspension will spontaneously form a steady single-vortex
state encircled by a counter-rotating cell boundary layer, with spiral cell
orientation within the vortex. Left unclear, however, was the flagellar
orientation, and hence the cell swimming direction, within the spiral vortex.
Here, using a fast simulation method that captures oriented cell-cell and
cell-fluid interactions in a minimal model of discrete-particle systems, we
predict the striking, counterintuitive result that in the presence of
collectively-generated fluid motion the cells within the spiral vortex actually
swim upstream against those flows. This is then confirmed by new experiments
reported here, which include measurements of flagella bundle orientation and
cell tracking in the self-organized state. These results highlight the complex
interplay between cell orientation and hydrodynamic flows in concentrated

parameter-free cranking model for isoscalar monopole excitation coupled to
intrinsic motion in even-even light nuclei. The model uses a wavefunction that
is a product of monopole and intrinsic wavefunctions and a constrained
variational method to derive, from a many-particle Schrodinger equation, a pair
of coupled self-consistent cranking-type Schrodinger equations for the monopole
and intrinsic systems. The monopole co-ordinate used is the trace of the
quadrupole tensor and hence describes the overall deformation of the nucleus.
The monopole and intrinsic wavefunctions are coupled to each other by the two
cranking equations and their associated parameters and by two constraints
imposed on the intrinsic system. For an isotropic Nilsson shell model and an
effective residual two-body interaction, the two coupled cranking equations are
solved in the Tamm Dancoff approximation. The strength of the interaction is
determined from a Hartree-Fock self-consistency argument. The excitation energy
of the first excited state is determined and found to agree closely with those
observed in the nuclei He-4, Be-8, C-12, O-16 , Ne-20, Mg-24, and Si-28. The
variation of the model parameters are explained. In particular, it is found
that the monopole excitation energy as a function of the mass number undergoes
an increase whenever the nucleons begin to occupy a new sub-shell state with
non-zero orbital angular momentum as a consequence of suppressing or
constraining the resulting spurious monopole excitation in the intrinsic
system.

powerful probe of primordial perturbations at small scales. Existing studies of

perturbations. Similarly, vector and tensor perturbations should source CMB
spectral distortions. In this paper, we give general expressions for the
effective heating rate caused by these types of perturbations, including
previously neglected contributions from polarization states and higher
multipoles. We then focus our discussion on the dissipation of tensors, showing
that for nearly scale invariant tensor power spectra, the overall distortion is
some six orders of magnitudes smaller than from the damping of adiabatic scalar
modes. We find simple analytic expressions describing the effective heating
rate from tensors using a quasi-tight coupling approximation. In contrast to
adiabatic modes, tensors cause heating without additional photon diffusion and
thus over a wider range of scales, as recently pointed out by Ota et. al 2014.
Our results are in broad agreement with their conclusions, but we find that
small-scale modes beyond k< 2x10^4 Mpc^{-1} cannot be neglected, leading to a
larger distortion, especially for very blue tensor power spectra. At small
scales, also the effect of neutrino damping on the tensor amplitude needs to be
included.

Kleiber found that basal metabolic rate of animals seemed to vary as a power
law of their body mass with exponent 3/4, instead of 2/3, as a
surface-to-volume argument predicts. The universality of exponent 3/4 -claimed
in terms of the fractal properties of the nutrient network- has recently been
challenged according to empirical evidence that observed a wealth of robust
exponents deviating from 3/4. Here we present a conceptually simple
thermodynamic framework, where the dependence of metabolic rate with body mass
emerges from a trade-off between the energy dissipated as heat and the energy
efficiently used by the organism to maintain its metabolism. This balance tunes
the shape of an additive model from which different effective scalings can be
recovered as particular cases, thereby reconciling previously inconsistent
empirical evidence in mammals, birds, insects and even plants under a unified
framework. This model is biologically motivated, fits remarkably well the data,
and also explains additional features such as the relation between energy lost
as heat and mass, the role and influence of different climatic environments or
the difference found between endotherms and ectotherms.

activity yields potentially interesting candidate molecules, with a bottleneck
in the determination of drug targets and the mechanism of anticancer action. A
novel approach to drug target deconvolution compares the abundance profiles of
proteins expressed in a panel of cells treated with different drugs, and
identifies proteins with cell-type independent and drug-specific regulation
that is exceptionally strong in relation to the other proteins. Mapping top
candidates on known protein networks reveals the mechanism of drug action,
while abundant proteins provide a signature of cellular death/survival
pathways. The above approach can significantly shorten drug target
identification, and thus facilitate the emergence of novel anticancer
treatments.

excellent probes of QCD matter created in ultra-relativistic heavy ion
collisions. Suppression predictions of quark and gluon jets appear to suggest a
clear hierarchy according to which neutral pions should be more suppressed than
D mesons, which in turn should be more suppressed than single electrons.
However, joint comparison of neutral pion (light probe) and non-photonic single
electron (heavy probe) suppression data at RHIC unexpectedly showed similar jet
suppression for these two probes, which presents the well-known heavy flavor
puzzle at RHIC. We here analyze which effects are responsible for this
unexpected result, by using the dynamical energy loss formalism. We find that
the main effect is a surprising reversal in the suppression hierarchy between
neutral pions and D mesons, which is due to the deformation of the suppression
patterns of light partons by fragmentation functions. Furthermore, we find
that, due to the decay functions, the single electron suppression approaches
the D meson suppression. Consequently, we propose that these two effects, taken
together, provide a clear intuitive explanation of this longstanding puzzle.

Applying the Contraction Mapping Theorem, it is shown that the model is locally
well-posed in time for any value of the source voltage of the device. In
addition it is proven that the MEMS model considered here possesses global
solutions for small source voltages whereas for large source voltages solutions
of the model have a finite maximal existence time. Furthermore, we comment on
the relationship of our model to its stationary version and to its small aspect
ratio limit by showing that there exists a unique exponentially stable steady

the vanishing aspect ratio limit. Our results extend the discussion of the

vertex in the Landau gauge, concentrating on contributions quadratic in the
metric. We employ an approximation scheme where ""one-loop"" diagrams are
computed using fully dressed gluon and ghost propagators, and tree-level
vertices. When a suitable kinematical configuration depending on a single
momentum scale $p$ is chosen, only two structures emerge: the tree-level
four-gluon vertex, and a tensor orthogonal to it. A detailed numerical analysis
reveals that the form factor associated with this latter tensor displays a
change of sign (zero-crossing) in the deep infrared, and finally diverges
logarithmically. The origin of this characteristic behavior is proven to be
entirely due to the masslessness of the ghost propagators forming the
corresponding ghost-loop diagram, in close analogy to a similar effect
established for the three-gluon vertex. However, in the case at hand, and under
the approximations employed, this particular divergence does not affect the
form factor proportional to the tree-level tensor, which remains finite in the
entire range of momenta, and deviates moderately from its naive tree-level
value. It turns out that the kinematic configuration chosen is ideal for
carrying out lattice simulations, because it eliminates from the connected
Green's function all one-particle reducible contributions, projecting out the
genuine one-particle irreducible vertex. Motivated by this possibility, we
discuss in detail how a hypothetical lattice measurement of this quantity would
compare to the results presented here, and the potential interference from an
additional tensorial structure, allowed by Bose symmetry, but not encountered
within our scheme.

either generalized parity $\mathcal P$ or charge conjugation $\mathcal C$. In
the minimal model with spontaneously broken strict $\mathcal P$, a large
tree-level contribution to strong CP violation can be computed in terms of the
spontaneous phase $\alpha$. Searches for the neutron electric dipole moments
then constrain the size of $\alpha$. Following the latest update on indirect CP
violation in the kaon sector, a bound on $W_R$ mass at $20 \text{TeV}$ is set.
Possible ways out of this bound, either by an additional relaxation mechanism
or explicit breaking of $\mathcal P$ are considered. To this end, the chiral
loop of the neutron electric dipole moment at next-to-leading order is
re-computed and provides an estimate of the weak contribution. Combining this
constraint with other CP violating observables in the kaon sector allows for
$M_{W_R} \gtrsim 3 \text{TeV}$. On the other hand, $\mathcal C$-symmetry is
free from such constraints, leaving the right-handed scale within the

practice, such classifiers provide a relatively high response at neighbor
windows overlapping a pedestrian, while the responses around potential false

sequences. If there is a pedestrian located within a frame, the same pedestrian
is expected to appear close to the same location in neighbor frames. Therefore,
such a location has chances of receiving high classification scores during
several frames, while false positives are expected to be more spurious. In this
paper we propose to exploit such correlations for improving the accuracy of
base pedestrian classifiers. In particular, we propose to use two-stage
classifiers which not only rely on the image descriptors required by the base
classifiers but also on the response of such base classifiers in a given
spatiotemporal neighborhood. More specifically, we train pedestrian classifiers
using a stacked sequential learning (SSL) paradigm. We use a new pedestrian

rates. We also test on a well known dataset: Caltech. The obtained results show
that our SSL proposal boosts detection accuracy significantly with a minimal

relativistic jets in active galactic nuclei. The observed flux of each
turbulent eddy is dependent upon its variable Doppler boosting factor, computed
as a function of the relativistic sum of the individual eddy and bulk jet
velocities and our viewing angle to the jet. The total observed flux is found
by integrating the radiation from the eddies over the turbulent spectrum. We
consider jets that contain turbulent eddies that have either standard
Kolmogorov or recently derived relativistic turbulence spectra. We also account
for the time delays in receiving the emission of the eddies due to their
different simulated positions in the jet, as well as due to the varying beaming
directions as they turn over. We examine these theoretical light curves and
compute power spectral densities (PSDs) for a range of viewing angles, bulk
velocities of the jet, and turbulent velocities. These PSD slopes depend
significantly on the turbulent velocity and are essentially independent of
viewing angle and bulk velocity. The flux variations produced in the
simulations for realistic values of the parameters tested are consistent with
the types of variations observed in radio-loud AGN as, for example, recently
measured with the Kepler satellite, as long as the turbulent velocities are not
too high.

fragmentation process. However, there are also other production mechanisms like
higher twist (HT) processes. A usual example of a HT process is a direct
production of an outgoing hadron, where the hadron is produced in the hard
subprocess without fragmentation.
  We study the HT phenomena using a shape analysis (xT scaling) of the
inclusive invariant cross sections of charged hadrons, measured by the ALICE
collaboration at center-of-mass energies \sqrt{s}=2.76 TeV and 7 TeV. The data
is compared to PYTHIA8 event generator and to a phenomenological model for HT.
Using PYTHIA8, we explore a possible enhancement of HT phenomena for isolated
particles, by comparing the shapes of the isolated distributions to inclusive
distributions. The results from the standard PYTHIA8, without HT, is compared
to a PYTHIA8 where we had included a HT process.
  Finally, we found out that the effects observed in the xT spectra originate
from kinematic biases posed by the isolation cuts, rather than from an
enrichment of the HT hadrons at the observed cross sections. A more detailed
data analysis is ongoing.

scheduling algorithm of throughput-optimality for constrained queueing networks
that arise in the context of communication networks, extensive efforts have
been devoted to resolving its most important drawback: high complexity. This
paper proposes a generic framework for designing throughput- optimal and
low-complexity scheduling algorithms for constrained queueing networks. Under
our framework, a scheduling algorithm updates current schedules by interacting
with a given oracle system that generates an approximate solution to a related
optimization task. One can utilize our framework to design a variety of
scheduling algorithms by choosing an oracle system such as random search,
Markov chain, belief propagation, and primal-dual methods. The complexity of
the resulting scheduling algorithm is determined by the number of operations
required for an oracle to process a single query, which is typically small. We
provide sufficient conditions for throughput-optimality of the scheduling
algorithm in general constrained queueing network models. The linear-time
algorithm of Tassiulas (1998) and the random access algorithm of Shah and Shin
(2012) correspond to special cases of our framework using random search and
Markov chain oracles, respectively. Our generic framework, however, provides a
unified proof with milder assumptions.

absent without the additional field. Moreover, the squeezing can be shifted
from inner- to outer-sidebands of the spectrum by simply changing the relative

reasoning about the results of those constructions. We show that Euclidean
geometry can be developed using only intuitionistic logic. We consider three
versions of Euclid's parallel postulate: Euclid's own formulation in his
Postulate 5; Playfair's 1795 version, and a new version we call the strong
parallel postulate. These differ in that Euclid's version and the new version
both assert the existence of a point where two lines meet, while Playfair's
version makes no existence assertion. Classically, the models of Euclidean
(straightedge-and-compass) geometry are planes over Euclidean fields. We prove
a similar theorem for constructive Euclidean geometry, by showing how to define
addition and multiplication without a case distinction about the sign of the
arguments. With intuitionistic logic, there are two possible definitions of
Euclidean fields, which turn out to correspond to the different versions of the
parallel axiom. In this paper, we completely settle the questions about
implications between the three versions of the parallel postulate: the strong
parallel postulate easily implies Euclid 5, and in fact Euclid 5 also implies
the strong parallel postulate, although the proof is lengthy, depending on the
verification that Euclid 5 suffices to define multiplication geometrically. We
show that Playfair does not imply Euclid 5, and we also give some other
independence results. Our independence proofs are given without discussing the
exact choice of the other axioms of geometry; all we need is that one can
interpret the geometric axioms in Euclidean field theory. The proofs use Kripke

Final pre-publication version","Annals of Pure and Applied Logic 166 (11) 1199-1273 (2015)",,,"math.LO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Euclid's reasoning is essentially constructive. Tarski's elegant and concise
first-order theory of Euclidean geometry, on the other hand, is essentially
non-constructive, even if we restrict attention (as we do here) to the theory
with line-circle and circle-circle continuity in place of first-order Dedekind
completeness. Here we exhibit three constructive versions of Tarski's theory.
One, like Tarski's theory, has existential axioms and no function symbols. We
then consider a version in which function symbols are used instead of
existential quantifiers. The third version has a function symbol for the
intersection point of two non-parallel, non-coincident lines, instead of only
for intersection points produced by Pasch's axiom and the parallel axiom; this
choice of function symbols connects directly to ruler-and-compass
constructions. All three versions have this in common: the axioms have been
modified so that the points they assert to exist are unique and depend
continuously on parameters. This modification of Tarski's axioms, with
classical logic, has the same theorems as Tarski's theory, but we obtain
results connecting it with ruler-and-compass constructions as well. In
particular, points constructively proved to exist can be constructed with ruler
and compass, uniformly in parameters; the same is true with non-constructive
proofs if several constructions are allowed for different cases.

support of determining the S-matrix in order to calculate scattering cross
sections. However there is also an interest in determining how expectation
values of field operators evolve in time from an initial state. In this paper I
will examine some aspects of this problem.

in discriminating one object from another or an object from background. The
self-organizing map (SOM) is an excellent tool in exploratory phase of data
mining. It projects its input space on prototypes of a low-dimensional regular
grid that can be effectively utilized to visualize and explore properties of
the data. This paper proposes an enhancement extraction method for accurate
extracting features for efficient image representation it based on SOM neural
network. In this approach, we apply three different partitioning approaches as
a region of interested (ROI) selection methods for extracting different
accurate textural features from medical image as a primary step of our
extraction method. Fisherfaces feature selection is used, for selecting
discriminated features form extracted textural features. Experimental result
showed the high accuracy of medical image categorization with our proposed
extraction method. Experiments held on Mammographic Image Analysis Society
(MIAS) dataset.

spherically symmetric fields are calculated. The elimination of the proper time
variable gives the motion equations for test particles with respect to
coordinate time and an account of gravitational acceleration from the
coordinate perspective. The results are applied to the Schwarzschild metric and
to the so-called exponential metric. In an attempt to add an account of
gravitational force from the coordinate perspective, the special relativistic
mass-energy relation is generalized to diagonal metrics involving location
dependent and possibly anisotropic light speeds. This move requires a
distinction between two aspects of the mass of a test particle (parallel and
perpendicular to the field). The obtained force expressions do not reveal
gravitational repulsion for the Schwarzschild metric and for the exponential
metric.
