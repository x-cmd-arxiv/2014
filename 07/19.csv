development of new hardware and software which may be expensive (in general,
these projects lack of enough resources to acquire fast and modern
infrastructure to become ompetitive and functional in the era of digital data).
Particularly, the development of software for data acquisition in real time is
one of the most important topics in experimental science and industry. However,
the constant improvements on the data acquisition hardware, discourages the
development of software highly optimized in order to minimize the consumption
of resources like processor time and read/write memory, etc. In this work, we
present a Open Source code called X Interface to RIS (Xitris). This is a
modular and distributed code which, using relatively slow processors and low
memory hardware, is able to acquire, display, compress and publish (via
Internet) digital data in real time. Xitris was developed for the Solar Radio
Interferometer (RIS) at Geophysics Institute of the National University of
Mexico (UNAM) but nowadays is working in another 3 radio observatories.

labeled images for large numbers of categories. Recently, deep convolutional
neural networks (CNNs) have emerged as clear winners on object classification
benchmarks, in part due to training with 1.2M+ labeled classification images.
Unfortunately, only a small fraction of those labels are available for the
detection task. It is much cheaper and easier to collect large quantities of
image-level labels from search engines than it is to collect detection data and
label it with precise bounding boxes. In this paper, we propose Large Scale
Detection through Adaptation (LSDA), an algorithm which learns the difference
between the two tasks and transfers this knowledge to classifiers for
categories without bounding box annotated data, turning them into detectors.
Our method has the potential to enable detection for the tens of thousands of
categories that lack bounding box annotations, yet have plenty of
classification data. Evaluation on the ImageNet LSVRC-2013 detection challenge
demonstrates the efficacy of our approach. This algorithm enables us to produce
a >7.6K detector by using available classification data from leaf nodes in the
ImageNet tree. We additionally demonstrate how to modify our architecture to
produce a fast detector (running at 2fps for the 7.6K detector). Models and

set out the current status for different scenarios for spiral arm formation,
the nature of the spiral arms they induce, and the consequences for gas

that, with possible the exception of barred galaxies, spiral arms are
transient, recurrent and initiated by swing amplified instabilities in the

idea is to explore the link between the {\it class} ${\cal C}$ property and the
closed positive currents of bidegree $(1,\,1)$ that the manifold supports, a
fact leading to the study of semi-continuity properties under deformations of
the complex structure of the dual cones of cohomology classes of such currents
and of Gauduchon metrics. Our main finding is a new class of compact complex,
possibly non-K\""ahler, manifolds defined by the condition that every Gauduchon
metric be strongly Gauduchon (sG), or equivalently that the Gauduchon cone be
small in a certain sense. We term them sGG manifolds and find numerical
characterisations of them in terms of certain relations between various
cohomology theories (De Rham, Dolbeault, Bott-Chern, Aeppli). We also produce
several concrete examples of nilmanifolds demonstrating the differences between
the sGG class and well-established classes of complex manifolds. We conclude
that sGG manifolds enjoy good stability properties under deformations and

deepest Herschel far-infrared and VLA radio continuum imaging, to explore,
using mass-complete samples, the evolution of the star formation activity and
dust attenuation of star-forming galaxies to z~4. Our main results can be
summarized as follows: i) the slope of the SFR-M correlation is consistent with
being constant, and equal to ~0.8 at least up to z~1.5, while its normalization
keeps increasing with redshift; ii) for the first time here we are able to
explore the FIR-radio correlation for a mass-selected sample of star-forming
galaxies: the correlation does not evolve up to z~4; iii) we confirm that
galaxy stellar mass is a robust proxy for UV dust attenuation in star-forming
galaxies, with more massive galaxies being more dust attenuated, strikingly we
find that this attenuation relation evolves very weakly with redshift, the
amount of dust attenuation increasing by less than 0.3 magnitudes over the
redshift range [0.5-4] for a fixed stellar mass, as opposed to a tenfold
increase of star formation rate; iv) the correlation between dust attenuation
and the UV spectral slope evolves in redshift, with the median UV spectral
slope of star-forming galaxies becoming bluer with redshift. By z~3, typical UV
slopes are inconsistent, given the measured dust attenuation, with the
predictions of commonly used empirical laws. Finally, building on existing
results, we show that gas reddening is marginally larger (by a factor of around
1.3) than stellar reddening at all redshifts probed, and also that the amount
of dust attenuation at a fixed ISM metallicity increases with redshift. We
speculate that our results support evolving ISM conditions of typical
star-forming galaxies such that at z~1.5 Main Sequence galaxies have ISM
conditions getting closer to those of local starbursts.

literature, however, the same cannot be said for functional data. The resultant
complexity from maintaining the functional structure of the data, rather than
using a scalar transformation to reduce dimensionality, renders the existing
literature on equivalence testing inadequate for the desired inference. We
propose a framework for equivalence testing for functional data within both the
frequentist and Bayesian paradigms. This framework combines extensions of
scalar methodologies with new methodology for functional data. Our frequentist
hypothesis test extends the Two One-Sided Testing (TOST) procedure for
equivalence testing to the functional regime. We conduct this TOST procedure
through the use of the nonparametric bootstrap. Our Bayesian methodology
employs a functional analysis of variance model, and uses a flexible class of
Gaussian Processes for both modeling our data and as prior distributions.
Through our analysis, we introduce a model for heteroscedastic variances within
a Gaussian Process by modeling variance curves via Log-Gaussian Process priors.
We stress the importance of choosing prior distributions that are commensurate
with the prior state of knowledge and evidence regarding practical equivalence.
We illustrate these testing methods through data from an ongoing method
comparison study between two devices for pulmonary function testing. In so
doing, we provide not only concrete motivation for equivalence testing for
functional data, but also a blueprint for researchers who hope to conduct
similar inference.

evidence of QPOs, pulsations, type-I bursts, or radio emission. Based on its

uncover critical behaviour such as dynamical phase transitions, which are not

shape, a result of a nonlinear interaction which compensates for wave packet

they pass through one another and emerge from the collision unaltered in shape,

consequence of the underlying integrability of the one-dimensional (1D)

by real-time imaging that a collision between solitons is a complex event that
differs markedly depending on the relative phase between the solitons. Yet,
they emerge from the collision unaltered in shape or amplitude, but with a new
trajectory reflecting a discontinuous jump. By controlling the strength of the
nonlinearity we shed new light on these fundamental features of soliton

settings it can be an unlikely ally. We consider the problem of learning the
class of $n$-bit parity functions by making queries to a quantum example
oracle. In the absence of noise, quantum and classical parity learning are easy
and almost equally powerful, both information-theoretically and
computationally. We show that in the presence of noise this story changes
dramatically. Indeed, the classical learning problem is believed to be
intractable, while the quantum version remains efficient. Depolarizing the
qubits at the oracle's output at any constant nonzero rate does not increase
the computational (or query) complexity of quantum learning more than
logarithmically. However, the problem of learning from corresponding classical
examples is the Learning Parity with Noise (LPN) problem, for which the best
known algorithms have superpolynomial complexity. This creates the possibility
of observing a quantum advantage with a few hundred noisy qubits. The presence
of noise is essential for creating this quantum-classical separation.

symmetry in the bulk, and supersymmetry breaking on the UV brane. The first two
generations of squarks are decoupled, reducing LHC signatures but also leading
to quadratic divergences at two loops. The model predicts light $W'$ and $Z'$

stellar discs than galaxies of later Hubble types. Major mergers are popularly
considered too violent mechanisms to form these breaks. We have investigated
whether major mergers can result into S0-like remnants with realistic
antitruncated stellar discs or not. We have analysed 67 relaxed S0 and E/S0
remnants resulting from dissipative N-body simulations of major mergers from
the GalMer database. We have simulated realistic R-band surface brightness
profiles of the remnants to identify those with antitruncated stellar discs.
Their inner and outer discs and the breaks are quantitatively characterized to
compare with real data. Nearly 70% of our S0-like remnants are antitruncated,
meaning that major mergers that result in S0s have a high probability of
producing Type-III stellar discs. Our remnants lie on top of the extrapolations
of the observational trends (towards brighter magnitudes and higher break
radii) in several photometric diagrams. In scale-free photometric diagrams,
simulations and observations overlap and the remnants reproduce the
observational trends, so the physical mechanism after antitruncations is highly
scalable. We have found novel photometric scaling relations between the
characteristic parameters of the antitruncations in real S0s, which are also
reproduced by our simulations. The trends in all the photometric planes can be
derived from three basic scaling relations that real and simulated Type-III S0s
fulfill: h_i \prop R_brkIII, h_o \prop R_brkIII, and mu_brkIII \prop R_brkIII,
where h_i and h_o are the scalelenghts of the inner and outer discs, and
mu_brkIII and R_brkIII are the surface brightness and radius of the breaks.
Mayor mergers provide a feasible mechanism to form realistic antitruncated S0
galaxies (abridged).

problems such as image interpretation and object recognition in natural scenes.
Over the past few years neuroscientists have made remarkable progress in
understanding how the human brain represents categories of objects and actions

operate on hand annotated images in which the objects and actions have been
assigned semantic tags by a human operator. No current models can account for
high-level visual function directly in terms of low-level visual input (i.e.,
pixels). To overcome this fundamental limitation we sought to develop a new
class of models that can predict human brain activity directly from low-level
visual input (i.e., pixels). We explored two classes of models drawn from
computer vision and machine learning. The first class of models was based on
Fisher Vectors (FV) and the second was based on Convolutional Neural Networks
(ConvNets). We find that both classes of models accurately predict brain
activity in high-level visual areas, directly from pixels and without the need
for any semantic tags or hand annotation of images. This is the first time that
such a mapping has been obtained. The fit models provide a new platform for
exploring the functional principles of human vision, and they show that modern

tissue comprised of seizure-initiating `foci'. These `foci' are thought to be
embedded within an epileptic network whose functional architecture dynamically
reorganizes during seizures through synchronous and asynchronous
neurophysiologic processes. Critical to understanding these dynamics is
identifying the synchronous connections that link foci to surrounding tissue
and investigating how these connections facilitate seizure generation and
termination. We use intracranial recordings from neocortical epilepsy patients
undergoing pre-surgical evaluation to analyze functional connectivity before
and during seizures. We develop and apply a novel technique to track network
reconfiguration in time and to parse these reconfiguration dynamics into
distinct seizure states, each characterized by unique patterns of network
connections that differ in their strength and topography. Our approach suggests
that seizures are generated when the synchronous relationships that isolate
seizure `foci' from the surrounding epileptic network are broken down. As
seizures progress, foci reappear as isolated subnetworks, marking a shift in
network state that may aid seizure termination. Collectively, our observations
have important theoretical implications for understanding the spatial
involvement of distributed cortical structures in the dynamics of seizure
generation, propagation and termination, and have practical significance in
determining which circuits to modulate with implantable devices.

established between the elements in each pass. Suppose there is an array
containing three elements a1, a2, a3 and if a relationship exist such that
a1<a2 and a2<a3 then it can be established that a1<a3 and so there is no need
to compare a1 and a3. Sorting is a fundamental operation in computer science.
RS sort is analyzed both theoretically and empirically. We have performed its

locate low energy critical points in the zero-field energy spectrum. Optical
absorption for two different configurations -- electric field parallel and

different selection rules with respect to which states are connected by the

states of a single layer nature from those with support in both layers. For
doped systems, a sharp increase in intra-Landau level absorption occurs with
increasing field as the level passes through the zero-field saddle point

deposit very small energies in form of nuclear recoils (below 100 keV). Because
of the low scintillation efficiency for nuclear recoils vs. electron recoils,
in most of the scintillating targets considered in the search for dark matter,
the region below 10 keVee concentrates most of the expected dark matter signal.
For this reason, very low energy threshold (at or below 2 keVee) and very low
background are required. This is the case of the ANAIS (Annual modulation with
NaI Scintillators) experiment. A good knowledge of the detector response
function for real scintillation events, a good characterization of other
anomalous or noise event populations contributing in that energy range, and the
development of convenient filtering procedures for the latter are mandatory to
achieve the required low background at such a low energy. In this work we will
present the specific protocols developed to select bulk scintillation events in
NaI(Tl), and its application to data obtained with the ANAIS-0 prototype.
Slight differences in time constants are expected in scintillation pulses
produced by nuclear or electron recoils in NaI(Tl), so in order to analyze the
effect of these filtering procedures in the case of a recoil population
attributable to dark matter, data from a neutron calibration have been used.

devices via read/write operations, which may incur considerable suspension
delays. Unfortunately, prior analysis methods for validating timing correctness

present. In this paper, we consider the problem of supporting two common types
of I/O applications in a multiprocessor system, that is, write-only
applications and read-write applications. For the write-only application model,
we present a much improved analysis technique that results in only O(m)
suspension-related utilization loss, where m is the number of processors. For
the second application model, we present a flexible I/O placement strategy and
a corresponding new scheduling algorithm, which can completely circumvent the
negative impact due to read- and write-induced suspension delays. We illustrate
the feasibility of the proposed I/O-placement-based schedule via a case study
implementation. Furthermore, experiments presented herein show that the
improvement with respect to system utilization over prior methods is often
significant.

quantum open system in the input-output formalism. For irreducible Markov
processes, we show that in the limit of large times the system-output state can
be approximated by a quantum Gaussian state whose mean is proportional to the
unknown parameter. This approximation holds locally in a neighbourhood of size
$t^{-1/2}$ in the parameter space, and provides an explicit expression of the
asymptotic quantum Fisher information in terms of the Markov generator.
  Furthermore we show that additive statistics of the counting and homodyne
measurements also satisfy local asymptotic normality and we compute the
corresponding classical Fisher informations. The mathematical theorems are
illustrated with the examples of a two-level system and the atom maser.
  Our results contribute towards a better understanding of the statistical and
probabilistic properties of the output process, with relevance for quantum
control engineering, and the theory of non-equilibrium quantum open systems.

  Editor's Suggestion",,"10.1103/PhysRevD.90.063518",,"astro-ph.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We analyse the feasibility of detecting the polarization of the CMB caused by
scattering of the remote temperature quadrupole by galaxy clusters with
forthcoming CMB polarization surveys. For low-redshift clusters, the signal is
strongly correlated with the local large-scale temperature and polarization
anisotropies, and the best prospect for detecting the cluster signal is via
cross-correlation. For high-redshift clusters, the correlation with the local
temperature is weaker and the power in the uncorrelated component of the
cluster polarization can be used to enhance detection. We derive linear and
quadratic maximum-likelihood estimators for these cases, and forecast
signal-to-noise values for the SZ surveys of a Planck-like mission and SPTPol.
Our estimators represent an optimal `stacking' analysis of the polarization
from clusters. We find that the detectability of the effect is sensitive to the
cluster gas density distribution, as well as the telescope resolution, cluster
redshift distribution, and sky coverage. We find that the effect is too small
to be detected in current and near-future SZ surveys without dedicated
polarization follow-up, and that an r.m.s. noise on the Stokes parameters of
roughly 1 uK-arcmin for each cluster field is required for a 2-sigma detection,
assuming roughly 550 clusters are observed. We discuss and quantify potential
biases from the kinetic part of the signal caused by the relative motion of the
cluster with respect to the CMB, and from the background CMB polarization
behind the cluster, discussing ways in which these biases might be mitigated.
Our formalism should be important for next-generation CMB polarization
missions, which we argue will be able to measure this effect with high
signal-to-noise. This will allow for an important consistency test of the LCDM
model on scales that are inaccessible to other probes.

estimate photometric redshifts for galaxies, which are then applied to derive
important galaxy properties such as luminosities and stellar masses. These
estimates can be noisy and suffer from systematic biases because of the
possible mis-selection of templates and the propagation of the photometric
redshift uncertainty. We introduce an algorithm, the Direct Empirical
Photometric method (DEmP), which can be used to directly estimate these
quantities using training sets, bypassing photometric redshift determination.
DEmP also applies two techniques to minimize the effects arising from the
non-uniform distribution of training-set galaxy redshifts from a flux-limited
sample. First, for each input galaxy, fitting is performed using a subset of
the training-set galaxies with photometry and colors closest to those of the
input galaxy. Second, the training set is artificially resampled to produce a
flat distribution in redshift, or other properties, e.g., luminosity. To test
the performance of DEmP, we use a 4-filter-band mock catalog to examine its
ability to recover redshift, luminosity, stellar mass, and luminosity and
stellar-mass functions. We also compare the results to those from two publicly
available template-fitting methods, finding that the DEmP algorithm outperforms
both. We find resampling the training set to have a uniform redshift
distribution produces the best results not only in photometric redshift, but
also in estimating luminosity and stellar mass. The DEmP method is especially
powerful in estimating quantities such as near-IR luminosities and stellar mass
using only data from a small number of optical bands.

locations. The spherical matrix-free interpolation operator range space
consists of a selective subspace of two dimensional trigonometric polynomials
which are rich enough to contain all spherical polynomials of degree less than

applying the FFT techniques with only ${\mathcal{O}}(N^2 \log N)$ complexity.
We describe the construction details using the FFT operators and provide
complete convergence analysis of the interpolatory approximation in the Sobolev

  We prove that the rate of spectrally accurate convergence of the

on a non-convex procedure whose local minima have not been fully analyzed yet.
In this paper, we consider a probabilistic model of sparse signals, and show
that, with high probability, sparse coding admits a local minimum around the

case of over-complete dictionaries, noisy signals, and possible outliers, thus
extending previous work limited to noiseless settings and/or under-complete

to understand how the key quantities of the problem, such as the coherence or
the level of noise, can scale with respect to the dimension of the signals, the

links into two phases, i.e., the multiple access (MAC) phase and the

we derive the optimal linear minimum mean-square-error (LMMSE) channel
estimators. The corresponding training designs for the MAC and BC phases are
then formulated and solved to improve channel estimation accuracy. For the
general scenario of training sequence design for both phases, two iterative
training design algorithms are proposed that are verified to produce training
sequences that result in near optimal channel estimation performance.
Furthermore, for specific practical scenarios, where the covariance matrices of
the channel or disturbances are of particular structures, the optimal training
sequence design guidelines are derived. In order to reduce training overhead,
the minimum required training length for channel estimation in both the MAC and
BC phases are also derived. Comprehensive simulations are carried out to
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed training designs.

prove that for a wide range of control problems for two-level quantum systems

by thinking at the Dyson model as a single-pattern hierarchical neural network
and we discuss the stability of different retrievable states as predicted by
the related self-consistencies obtained from a mean-field bound and from a
bound that bypasses the mean-field limitation. The latter is worked out by
properly reabsorbing fluctuations of the magnetization related to higher levels
of the hierarchy into effective fields for the lower levels. Remarkably, mixing
Amit's ansatz technique (to select candidate retrievable states) with the
interpolation procedure (to solve for the free energy of these states) we prove
that (due to gauge symmetry) the Dyson model accomplishes both serial and
parallel processing. One step forward, we extend this scenario toward multiple
stored patterns by implementing the Hebb prescription for learning within the
couplings. This results in an Hopfield-like networks constrained on a
hierarchical topology, for which, restricting to the low storage regime (where
the number of patterns grows at most logarithmical with the amount of neurons),
we prove the existence of the thermodynamic limit for the free energy and we
give an explicit expression of its mean field bound and of the related improved

and stellar winds until the onset of Roche-lobe overflow. These binaries
contain a compact object (either a black-hole, a neutron-star, or a planet) and
a stellar component. We integrate the full set of tidal equations, which are
based on Hut's model for tidal evolution, and we couple them with the angular
momentum loss in a stellar wind. Our aim is twofold. Firstly, we wish to
highlight some interesting evolutionary outcomes of the coupling. When tides
are coupled with a non-massive stellar wind, one interesting outcome is that in
certain types of binaries, the stellar spin tends to reach a quasi-equilibrium
state, where the effect of tides and wind are counteracting each other. When
tides are coupled with a massive wind, we parametrize the evolution in terms of
the decoupling radius, at which the wind decouples from the star. Even for
small decoupling radii this \emph{wind braking} can drive systems on the main
sequence to Roche-lobe overflow that otherwise would fail to do so. Our second
aim is to inspect whether simple timescale considerations are a good
description of the evolution of the systems. We find that simple timescale
considerations, which rely on neglecting the coupling between tides and stellar
winds, do not accurately represent the true evolution of compact binaries. The
outcome of the coupled evolution of the rotational and orbital elements can
strongly differ from simple timescale considerations, as already pointed out by
Barker & Ogilvie 2009 in the case of short-period planetary systems.

  Canonical Tensor Approximation",,,,,"math.NA cs.NA math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Alternating least squares (ALS) is often considered the workhorse algorithm
for computing the rank-R canonical tensor approximation, but for certain
problems its convergence can be very slow. The nonlinear conjugate gradient
(NCG) method was recently proposed as an alternative to ALS, but the results
indicated that NCG is usually not faster than ALS. To improve the convergence
speed of NCG, we consider a nonlinearly preconditioned nonlinear conjugate
gradient (PNCG) algorithm for computing the rank-R canonical tensor
decomposition. Our approach uses ALS as a nonlinear preconditioner in the NCG
algorithm. Alternatively, NCG can be viewed as an acceleration process for ALS.
We demonstrate numerically that the convergence acceleration mechanism in PNCG
often leads to important pay-offs for difficult tensor decomposition problems,
with convergence that is significantly faster and more robust than for the
stand-alone NCG or ALS algorithms. We consider several approaches for
incorporating the nonlinear preconditioner into the NCG algorithm that have
been described in the literature previously and have met with success in
certain application areas. However, it appears that the nonlinearly
preconditioned NCG approach has received relatively little attention in the
broader community and remains underexplored both theoretically and
experimentally. Thus, this paper serves several additional functions, by
providing in one place a concise overview of several PNCG variants and their
properties that have only been described in a few places scattered throughout
the literature, by systematically comparing the performance of these PNCG
variants for the tensor decomposition problem, and by drawing further attention
to the usefulness of nonlinearly preconditioned NCG as a general tool. In
addition, we briefly discuss the convergence of the PNCG algorithm.

particles depends on the relative inter-particle distance, the wave function
overlap between states of two rod-like particles, and so the tunneling
conductance, depends also on the relative orientation of the rod axes. Modeling
slender rod-like particles as cylindrical quantum wells of diameter $D$ and
length $L\gg D$, we calculate the matrix element of the tunneling between two
rods for arbitrary relative orientations of the rod axes. We show that
tunneling between two parallel rods is about $L/\sqrt{D\xi}$ times larger than
the tunneling matrix element for perpendicular rods, where $\xi$ is the
tunneling decay length. By considering the full dependence of the tunneling
conductance on the angle between rod axes, we calculate within an effective
medium theory the conductivity of dispersions of rods with different degrees of
alignment. We find that for isotropically oriented rods, the effect of
orientation in the tunneling processes is marginal for all rod concentrations.
On the contrary, for systems of strongly aligned rods, the enhanced tunneling
between nearly parallel rods increases significantly the system conductivity in
a relatively large concentration range. Next, we consider systems in which
short-range attraction between rods is added, as in dispersions of rods with
depletion interaction. We find that the strongly anisotropic attraction
promotes enhanced tunneling between neighboring parallel rods, increasing the
effective medium conductivity by several orders of magnitude compared to the
case in which the angular dependence of tunneling is ignored, even for
relatively weak attractions.

  Banach Space",,,,,"math.FA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The application of generalized inverses is usually neglected in pure
mathematical research. However, it is very effective for this paper. We expand
the famous matrix rank theorem due to R. Penrose to operators between Banach
paces. Therefore a modern perturbation analysis of generalized inverses is
built. Hereby, we find and prove a complete rank theorem in advanced calculus.
So a complete answer to the rank theorem problem presented by M. S. Berger is
given. Applying the co-final set and the perturbation analysis of generalized
inverses we prove the Frobenius theorem in Banach space, in the proof of which
the used vector field and flow theory are avoided. The co-final set is
essential to the Frobenius theorem. When the co-final set is trivial, the
theorem reduces to the differential equation with initial value in Banach
space. Also, we discuss a non-trivial family of subspaces and give its smooth
integral submanifold.

a new ternary intermetallic compound PrRhSn3 which crystallizes in LaRuSn3-type
cubic structure (space group Pm-3n). At low applied fields the dc magnetic
susceptibility exhibits a sharp anomaly below 6~K with an irreversible behavior
in zero field cooled (ZFC) and field cooled (FC) susceptibility below 5.5 K.
The ac susceptibility exhibits a frequency dependent anomaly revealing a
spin-glass behavior with a freezing temperature, T_f = 4.3 K. The observation
of spin-glass behavior is further supported by a very slow decay of
thermo-remnant magnetization (mean relaxation time tau = 2149 s). However, a
small jump at very low field in the isothermal magnetization at 2 K and a weak
anomaly in the specific heat near 5.5 K reveal the presence of ferromagnetic
clusters. The frequency dependence of the transition temperature T_f in the ac
susceptibility obeys the Vogel-Fulcher law, nu = nu_0exp[-E_a/k_B(T_f-T_0)]
with activation energy E_a/k_B = 19.1 K. This together with an intermediate
value of the parameter delta T_f = Delta T_f/T_f Delta(log nu) = 0.086 provide
an evidence for the formation of a cluster-glass state in PrRhSn3. The magnetic
contribution of the specific heat reveals a broad Schottky-type anomaly
centered around 10 K and the analysis based on the crystal electric field model
indicates a singlet ground state. Further, below T_f the magnetic part of the
specific heat exhibits a T^{3/2} temperature dependence. The strong influence
of the crystal electric field and a T^{3/2} temperature dependence are also
seen in the electrical resistivity which reveals a metallic character and a
high magnetoresistance. We also obtain a surprisingly large value of
Sommerfeld-Wilson ratio R_W ~ 247$.

about their diffuse emission at any observing frequency, and hence on thermal
and non-thermal plasma possibly residing within dSphs. In this paper, we
present deep radio observations of six local dSphs performed with the Australia

about one degree around three ""classical"" dSphs, Carina, Fornax, and Sculptor,
and of about half of degree around three ""ultra-faint"" dSphs, BootesII, Segue2,

restoring beams FWHM ranged from 4.2 x 2.5 arcseconds to 30.0 x 2.1 arcseconds
in the most elongated case. A catalogue including the 1392 sources detected in
the six dSph fields is reported. The main properties of the background sources
are discussed, with positions and fluxes of brightest objects compared with the
FIRST, NVSS, and SUMSS observations of the same fields. The observed population
of radio emitters in these fields is dominated by synchrotron sources. We
compute the associated source number counts at 2 GHz down to fluxes of 0.25

extremely quiescent and dim objects, where thermal and non-thermal diffuse
emissions lack, so far, of detection. In order to possibly study the dSph
interstellar medium, deep observations are required. They could reveal
non-thermal emissions associated with the very-low level of star formation, or
to particle dark matter annihilating or decaying in the dSph halo. In this
work, we employ radio observations of six dSphs, conducted with the Australia
Telescope Compact Array in the frequency band 1.1-3.1 GHz, to test the presence
of a diffuse component over typical scales of few arcmin and at an rms
sensitivity below 0.05 mJy/beam. We observed the dSph fields with both a
compact array and long baselines. Short spacings led to a synthesized beam of
about 1 arcmin and were used for the extended emission search. The
high-resolution data mapped background sources, which in turn were subtracted
in the short-baseline maps, to reduce their confusion limit. We found no
significant detection of a diffuse radio continuum component. After a detailed
discussion on the modelling of the cosmic-ray (CR) electron distribution and on
the dSph magnetic properties, we present bounds on several physical quantities
related to the dSphs, such that the total radio flux, the angular shape of the
radio emissivity, the equipartition magnetic field, and the injection and
equilibrium distributions of CR electrons. Finally, we discuss the connection
to far-infrared and X-ray observations.

optimization and learning problems, in both statistical and sequential
frameworks, has shifted the focus of algorithmic machine learning to examine
this interplay. In particular, on one hand, this intertwinement brings forward
new challenges in reassessment of the performance of learning algorithms
including generalization and regret bounds under the assumptions imposed by
convexity such as analytical properties of loss functions (e.g., Lipschitzness,
strong convexity, and smoothness). On the other hand, emergence of datasets of
an unprecedented size, demands the development of novel and more efficient
optimization algorithms to tackle large-scale learning problems.
  The overarching goal of this thesis is to reassess the smoothness of loss
functions in statistical learning, sequential prediction/online learning, and
stochastic optimization and explicate its consequences. In particular we
examine how smoothness of loss function could be beneficial or detrimental in
these settings in terms of sample complexity, statistical consistency, regret
analysis, and convergence rate, and investigate how smoothness can be leveraged
to devise more efficient learning algorithms.
