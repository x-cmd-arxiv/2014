chi(T), isothermal magnetization M(H), thermo-remnant magnetization M(t), ac
magnetic susceptibility chi_ac(T), specific heat C_p(T), electrical resistivity
rho(T), muon spin relaxation (muSR) and inelastic neutron scattering (INS)
measurements. A magnetic phase transition is marked by a sharp anomaly at T_tr
= 12.2 K in chi(T) measured at low applied fields which is also reflected in
the C_p(T) data through a weak anomaly at 12 K. An irreversibility between the
zero field cooled and field cooled chi(T) data below 12.2 K and a very large
relaxation time of M(t) indicates the presence of ferromagnetic correlation.
The magnetic part of specific heat shows a broad Schottky-type anomaly near
40~K due to the crystal electric field (CEF) effect. An extremely small value
of magnetic entropy below 12 K suggests a CEF-split singlet ground state which
is confirmed from our analysis of INS data. The INS spectra show two prominent
inelastic excitations at 8.5 meV and 18.5 meV that could be well accounted by a
CEF model. The CEF splitting energy between the ground state singlet and the
first excited doublet is found to be 92 K. Our muSR data reveal a possible
magnetic ordering below 30 K which is much higher than that found from the
specific heat and magnetic susceptibility measurements. This could be due to
the presence of short range correlations well above the long range magnetic
ordering or due to the electronic changes induced by muons. The induced moment
magnetism in the singlet ground state system PrIrSi3 with such a large
splitting energy of 92 K is quite surprising.

data reveal the signatures of spin-glass behavior in PrRuSi3 with a freezing
temperature of 9.8 K. At low magnetic fields, we observe two sharp anomalies
(at 4.9 and 8.6 K) in magnetic susceptibility data. In contrast, the specific
heat data show only a broad Schottky-type anomaly centered around 10 K.
However, muSR reveals very low frequency coherent oscillations at 1.8 K with an
onset of fast relaxation below 12 K indicating a long range magnetically
ordered ground state with very small moment. On the other hand, no magnetic
Bragg peaks are observed in low temperature neutron diffraction data at 1.8 K.
These two contradictory ground states, spin-glass versus magnetic order, can be
explained if the spin-glass behavior in PrRuSi3 is considered due to the
dynamic fluctuations of the crystal field levels as has been proposed for
spin-glass behavior in PrAu2Si2. Two sharp inelastic excitations near 2.4 meV
and 14.7 meV are observed in the inelastic neutron scattering (INS) spectra
between 4 K and 50 K. Further, exchange coupling J_ex obtained from the
analysis of INS data with CEF model provides evidence for the spontaneously
induced magnetic order with a CEF-split singlet (Gamma_t4) ground state.
However, the exchange coupling seems to be close to the critical value for the
induced moment magnetism, therefore we tend to believe that the dynamic
fluctuations between the ground state singlet and excited doublet CEF levels is
responsible for spin-glass behavior in PrRuSi3.

supersymmetry (SUSY) which remains unbroken. We show that SUSY is robust with
respect to decoherence and dissipation. In particular, a stationary density
matrix at the supersymmetric lines in the parameter space has a degenerate
subspace. A dimension of this subspace is given by the Witten index and thus
topologically protected. As a consequence of this SUSY, dissipative dynamics at
the supersymmetric lines is constrained by an additional conserved quantity
which translates some part of information about an initial state into the
stationary state subspace. We also demonstrate a robustness of this additional
conserved quantity away from the supersymmetric lines. In addition, we
demonstrate that the same SUSY structures are present in condensed matter
systems with spin-orbit couplings of Rashba and Dresselhaus types, and
therefore spin-orbit coupled systems at the SUSY lines should be robust with
respect to various types of disorder and decoherences. Our findings suggest
that optical and condensed matter systems at the SUSY points can be used for

Results of the parameter study of the base state with a spiral shock are also
presented. The single-mode feathering instability that leads to growing
perturbations may explain the feathering phenomenon found in nearby spiral
galaxies. The self-gravity of the gas, characterized by its average surface
density, is an important parameter which 1) shifts the spiral shock further
downstream; 2) increases the growth rate and decreases the characteristic
spacing of the feathering structure due to the instability. On the other hand,
while the magnetic field suppresses the velocity fluctuation associated with
the feathers, it does not strongly affect their growth rate. Using a set of
typical parameters of the grand-design spiral galaxy M51 at 2 kpc from the
center, the spacing of the feathers with the maximum growth rate is found to be
530 pc, which agrees with the previous observational studies.

Galaxy is based on the study of the suppression, due to decay, of the flux of
unstable nuclei such as beryllium-10, that have lifetime of appropriate
duration. The Cosmic Ray Isotope Spectrometer (CRIS) collaboration has measured
the ratio between the fluxes of beryllium-10 and beryllium-9 in the energy
range E_0 \simeq 70-145 MeV/nucleon, and has used the data to estimate an
escape time tau_{ esc} = 15.0 +- 1.6 Myr. This widely quoted result has been
obtained in the framework of a simple leaky-box model where the distributions
of escape time and age for stable particles in the Galaxy are identical and
have exponential form. In general, the escape time and age distributions do not
coincide, they are not unique (because they depend on the injection or
observation point), and do not have a simple exponential shape. It is therefore
necessary to discuss the measurement of the beryllium ratio in a framework that
is more general and more realistic than the leaky-box model.
  In this work we compute the escape time and age distributions of cosmic rays
in the Galaxy in a model based on diffusion that is much more realistic than
the simple leaky-box, but that remains sufficiently simple to have exact
analytic solutions. Using the age distributions of the model to interpret the
measurements of the beryllium-10 suppression, one obtains a cosmic ray
residence time that is significantly longer (a factor 2 to 4 depending on the
extension of the cosmic ray halo) than the leaky-box estimate. This revised
residence time implies a proportional reduction of the power needed to generate
the galactic cosmic rays.

measure (DDM) on the model parameter. Typical examples of DDM are the posterior
distributions. Like for posteriors, the quality of a DDM is characterized by
the contraction rate which we allow to be local, i.e., depending on the
parameter. We construct confidence sets as DDM-credible sets and address the
issue of optimality of such sets, via a trade-off between its ""size"" (the local
radial rate) and its coverage probability. In the mildly ill-posed inverse
signal-in-white-noise model, we construct a DDM as empirical Bayes posterior
with respect to a certain prior, and define its (default) credible set. Then we
introduce 'excessive bias restriction' (EBR), more general than
'self-similarity' and 'polished tail condition' recently studied in the
literature. Under EBR, we establish the confidence optimality of our credible
set with some local (oracle) radial rate. We also derive the oracle estimation
inequality and the oracle DDM-contraction rate, non-asymptotically and
uniformly in $\ell_2$. The obtained local results are more powerful than
global: adaptive minimax results for a number of smoothness scales follow as

the curvature contribution to boundary flow, neglected sofar. Vinogradova's

distinguishing finite-slip from no-slip and quantifying the degree of flow slip

fluid dynamics. Moreover, qualitatively different from previous theories, our
theory predicts a finite hydrodynamic repulsive force for two hydrophobic

in the modern regime of $p \gg n$, where classical clustering methods face
challenges.
  We propose Influential Features PCA (IF-PCA) as a new clustering procedure.
In IF-PCA, we select a small fraction of features with the largest
Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) scores, where the threshold is chosen by adapting the
recent notion of Higher Criticism, obtain the first $(K-1)$ left singular
vectors of the post-selection normalized data matrix, and then estimate the
labels by applying the classical k-means to these singular vectors. It can be
seen that IF-PCA is a tuning free clustering method.
  We apply IF-PCA to $10$ gene microarray data sets. The method has competitive
performance in clustering. Especially, in three of the data sets, the error
rates of IF-PCA are only $29\%$ or less of the error rates by other methods. We
have also rediscovered a phenomenon on empirical null by \cite{Efron} on
microarray data.
  With delicate analysis, especially post-selection eigen-analysis, we derive
tight probability bounds on the Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistics and show that
IF-PCA yields clustering consistency in a broad context. The clustering problem
is connected to the problems of sparse PCA and low-rank matrix recovery, but it
is different in important ways. We reveal an interesting phase transition

classifier is learned across all the quantized scales/aspect-ratios for

  To answer these questions, this paper presents a method for feature selection

visualization of the features and regions that are important for visual

promising building block candidate for future molecular electronic devices.
Transport properties of SAM-MJs are usually calculate using either the
phenomenological Simmons model, or a fully-coherent transport theory, employing
the SAMs periodicity. We suggest that dephasing plays an important role in
determining the transport properties of SAM-MJs. We present an approach for
calculating the transport properties of SAM-MJs that inherently takes into
account in-plane dephasing in the electron motion as it traverses the SAM
plane. The calculation is based on the non-equilibrium Green's function
formalism, with a local dynamics approximation that describes incoherent motion
along the SAM plane. Our approach describes well the two hallmarks of transport
through SAM-MJs, namely the exponential decay of current with molecular chain
length and the reduction of the current per molecule as compared to
single-molecule junctions. Specifically, we show that dephasing leads to an
exponential decay of the current as a function of molecular length, even for
resonant tunneling, where the fully coherent calculation shows little or no
length-dependence of the current. The dephasing is also shown to lead to a
substantial reduction of the current in a SAM-MJ as compared to the single
molecule junction, in a realistic parameter regime, where the coherent
calculation shows only a very small reduction of the current. Finally, we
discuss the effect of dephasing on more subtle transport phenomena such as the
conductance even-odd effect and negative differential resistance.

In two segments of the observation, lasting for $\sim$ 30--50 ks, the hardness
ratio is very high. In these segments, the spectrum shows a large absorption
column density and correspondingly large equivalent widths of the iron
fluorescence lines. We found no conclusive evidence for the presence of a

the electromagnetic PIC algorithm to analyze the origin of these instabilities.
We rigorously derive the faithful 3D numerical dispersion of the PIC algorithm,
and then specialize to the Yee FDTD scheme. In particular, we account for the
manner in which the PIC algorithm updates and samples the fields and
distribution function. Temporal and spatial phase factors from solving
Maxwell's equations on the Yee grid with the leapfrog scheme are also
explicitly accounted for. Numerical solutions to the electrostatic-like modes

parameters of interest. In the succeeding analysis, we investigate how the
finite grid instability arises from the interaction of the numerical 1D modes
admitted in the system and their aliases. The most significant interaction is
due critically to the correct represenation of the operators in the dispersion
relation. We obtain a simple analytic expression for the peak growth rate due

return-volatility correlations, i.e., the so-called leverage and anti-leverage
effects, are particularly important for the understanding of the price
dynamics. However, the microscopic origination of the leverage and
anti-leverage effects is still not understood, and how to produce these effects
in agent-based modeling remains open. On the other hand, in constructing
microscopic models, it is a promising conception to determine model parameters
from empirical data rather than from statistical fitting of the results.
  Methods: To study the microscopic origination of the return-volatility
correlation in financial systems, we take into account the individual and
collective behaviors of investors in real markets, and construct an agent-based
model. The agents are linked with each other and trade in groups, and
particularly, two novel microscopic mechanisms, i.e., investors' asymmetric
trading and herding in bull and bear markets, are introduced. Further, we
propose effective methods to determine the key parameters in our model from
historical market data.
  Results: With the model parameters determined for six representative
stock-market indices in the world respectively, we obtain the corresponding
leverage or anti-leverage effect from the simulation, and the effect is in
agreement with the empirical one on amplitude and duration. At the same time,
our model produces other features of the real markets, such as the fat-tail
distribution of returns and the long-term correlation of volatilities.
  Conclusions: We reveal that for the leverage and anti-leverage effects, both
the investors' asymmetric trading and herding are essential generation
mechanisms. These two microscopic mechanisms and the methods for the
determination of the key parameters can be applied to other complex systems
with similar asymmetries.

  In light of prior contradictory results found in the literature, the

uncover age dependence of $p(\tau)$, hidden to previous studies. Moreover, the

analysis of chronotaxic systems and makes possible the identification of
chronotaxic systems with time-varying parameters. All types of chronotaxic

(defocusing) interaction makes a 2D polariton condensate able to accumulate its
energy under above-resonance optical pumping. The energy can be accumulated
during a lot of polariton lifetimes, resulting in the state in which the
mismatch of the pump frequency is compensated by the blueshift of the polariton
resonance. The process begins when the field density reaches the parametric
scattering threshold that is inversely proportional to the polariton lifetime.
Although the increase in energy may be arbitrarily slow in its beginning, it is
followed by a blowup. This scenario applies to the case of the transitions
between steady states in multistable cavity-polariton systems. There is a
tradeoff between the latency of the transitions and the pump power involving
them.

the existence of gap (e.g. Gribov gap) in gauge systems at low energy, the
fermion fields can be explicitly bosonized by new gauge fields. When chemical
potential of the gauge systems is introduced, we find that topological terms
(such as Chern-Simons term in 2+1D) as constraints inevitably emerge at low
energy. The fermion sign problem at finite chemical potential and its deep
connection to the Chern-Simons theories are discussed. The Wilson's criteria of
confinement in pure gauge theories is generalized to finite chemical potential
case. The chemical potential dependence of physical quantities at strong
coupling are explicitly calculated, including the expectation value of the
Wilson loop, the confining potential and the confined/deconfined transition
temperature. The bosonization puts discussions on chiral symmetry breaking and
confined/deconfined transition on an equal footing, so it is suitable for the
study of the subtle interplay between them. We find that the chiral symmetry
breaking is a necessary (not sufficient) condition for the confinement in 2+1D,
and argue that the confined/deconfined phases are not characterized by any
local symmetries but distinguished by their non-local topologies. The low
energy modes of the strongly coupled gauge systems in a non-symmetry breaking
phase is also discussed. The results of the paper can be widely applied to real
strongly coupled gauge systems, e.g. high-temperature superconductor and
quantum chromodynamical systems in 2+1 dimensions.

has received much attention and the main focus is to figure out how large the

  In this paper we give a primal-dual algorithm that achieve this bound for

them to construct primal solutions. The adversarial guarantee that holds for

theoretical models on the focus of scientific investigation. As for the
research branch, neural networks are handled and studied by psychologists,
neurobiologists, engineers, mathematicians and theoretical physicists. In
particular, in theoretical physics, the key instrument for the quantitative
analysis of neural networks is statistical mechanics. From this perspective,
here, we first review attractor networks: starting from ferromagnets and
spin-glass models, we discuss the underlying philosophy and we recover the
strand paved by Hopfield, Amit-Gutfreund-Sompolinky. One step forward, we
highlight the structural equivalence between Hopfield networks (modeling
retrieval) and Boltzmann machines (modeling learning), hence realizing a deep
bridge linking two inseparable aspects of biological and robotic spontaneous
cognition. As a sideline, in this walk we derive two alternative (with respect
to the original Hebb proposal) ways to recover the Hebbian paradigm, stemming
from ferromagnets and from spin-glasses, respectively. Further, as these notes
are thought of for an Engineering audience, we highlight also the mappings
between ferromagnets and operational amplifiers and between antiferromagnets
and flip-flops (as neural networks -built by op-amp and flip-flops- are
particular spin-glasses and the latter are indeed combinations of ferromagnets
and antiferromagnets), hoping that such a bridge plays as a concrete
prescription to capture the beauty of robotics from the statistical mechanical
perspective.

$1~m_\textrm{Mars}\lesssim m_\textrm{X}\lesssim 2.4~m_\oplus$ supposedly moving
at $65-80~\textrm{AU}$ along a moderately inclined orbit has been hypothesized
in order to explain certain features of the midplane of the Kuiper Belt Objects
(KBOs). We preliminarily selected two possible scenarios for such a PX, and
numerically simulated its effect on the Earth-Saturn range $\rho(t)$ by varying
some of its orbital parameters over a certain time span; then, we compared our
results with some existing actual range residuals. By assuming $m_\textrm{X} =
1~m_\textrm{Mars}$ and a circular orbit, such a putative new member of our
Solar System would nominally perturb $\rho(t)$ by a few km over $\Delta t =
12~\textrm{yr}~(2004-2016)$. However, the Cassini spaceraft accurately measured
$\rho(t)$ to the level of $\sigma_\rho\simeq 100~\textrm{m}$. Nonetheless, such
a scenario should not be considered as necessarily ruled out since the Cassini
data were reduced so far without explicitly modeling any PX. Indeed, a NASA JPL
team recently demonstrated that an extra-signature as large as 4 km affecting
the Kronian range would be almost completely absorbed in fitting incomplete
dynamical models, i.e. without PX itself, to such simulated data, thus not
showing up in the standard post-fit range residuals. Larger anomalous
signatures would instead occur for $m_\textrm{X} > 1~m_\textrm{Mars}$. Their
nominal} amplitude could be as large as $50-150~\textrm{km}$ for $m_\textrm{X}
= 2.4~m_\oplus$, thus making less plausible their existence.

the Gaussian, with all terms fully complex, acting as a propagator, leads to

the real random walk but executed under the rules of the complex number system.
Inferences are 1. There is a standard view that Schrodinger equation is
deterministic, while wavefunction collapse is probabilistic by Born's rule.
This is opposed by the now demonstrated linkage to the central limit theorem,
indicating a stochastic picture for the foundation of Schrodinger equation
itself. 2. This picture is also consistent with the dynamic origin of
probabilities suggested for the Born rule in the de Broglie Bohm pilot wave
theory. Reasons for the primary role of C are open to discussion. The present

considerable value upon the role of the environment as a major factor which can
promote prolonged healthy longevity. Our contemporary, information-rich
environment is taken to mean not merely the actual physical surroundings of a
person but it is also considered in a more abstract sense, to denote cultural,
societal and technological influences. Our modern environment is far from being
static or stable. In fact, it is continually changing in an exponential manner,
necessitating constant adaptive responses on behalf of our developmental and
evolutionary mechanisms. In this paper, I attempt to describe how a continual,
balanced and meaningful exposure to a stimulating environment, including
exposure to information-that-requires-action (but NOT trivial information), has
direct or indirect repercussions on epigenetic mechanisms which may then act to
prolong healthy longevity. Information gained from our environment acts as a
hormetic stimulus which up-regulates biological responses and feedback loops,
eventually leading to improved repair of age-related damage. The consequence of
this biological information-processing mechanism may influence resource
allocation and redress the imbalance between somatic cell versus germ-line cell
repairs. This can eventually have evolutionary consequences resulting in the
drastic reduction of age-related disease and degeneration.
