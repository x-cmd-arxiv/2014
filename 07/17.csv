latest results of $0\nu\beta\beta$ progresses from various isotopes, including
the recent calculations of the nuclear matrix elements, we find that the
strongest constraint of the effective Majorana neutrino mass is from the
$^{136}\rm{Xe}$ data of the EXO-200 and KamLAND-Zen collaborations. Further
more, by combining the $0\nu\beta\beta$ experimental data with the neutrino

mass eigenstates and flavour eigenstates and suggest several relations among
these neutrino masses.

Riemann $\zeta$-function, necessary to understand the importance and nature of
the Riemann hypothesis. In particular this first part describes the analytic
continuation, the functional equation, trivial zeros, the Euler product
formula, Riemann's main result relating the zeros on the critical strip to the
distribution of primes, the exact counting formula for the number of zeros on
the strip $N(T)$ and the GUE statistics of the zeros on the critical line. We
then turn to presenting some new results obtained in the past year and describe
several strategies towards proving the RH. First we describe an electro-static
analogy and argue that if the electric potential along the line $\Re (z) =1$ is
a regular alternating function, the RH would follow. The main new result is
that the zeros on the critical line are in one-to-one correspondence with the
zeros of the cosine function, and this leads to a transcendental equation for
the $n$-th zero on the critical line that depends only on $n$. If there is a
unique solution to this equation for every $n$, then if $N_0 (T)$ is the number
of zeros on the critical line, then $N_0(T) = N(T)$, i.e. all zeros are on the
critical line. These results are generalized to two infinite classes of
functions, Dirichlet $L$-functions and $L$-functions based on modular forms. We
present extensive numerical analysis of the solutions of these equations. We
apply these methods to the Davenport-Heilbronn $L$-function, which is known to
have zeros off of the line, and explain why the RH fails in this case. We also
present a new approximation to the $\zeta$-function that is analogous to the
Stirling approximation to the $\Gamma$-function.

The assimilation methods are tested in the Simplified Parameterizations
PrimitivE-Equation Dynamics (SPEEDY) model, an atmospheric general circulation

balloon soundings. For the data assimilation scheme, the supervised NN, the
multilayer perceptrons (MLP-NN), is applied. The MLP-NN are able to emulate the
analysis from the local ensemble transform Kalman filter (LETKF). After the
training process, the method using the MLP-NN is seen as a function of data
assimilation. The NN were trained with data from first three months of 1982,
1983, and 1984. A hind-casting experiment for the 1985 data assimilation cycle
using MLP-NN were performed with synthetic observations for January 1985. The
numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the NN technique for
atmospheric data assimilation. The results of the NN analyses are very close to
the results from the LETKF analyses, the differences of the monthly average of
absolute temperature analyses is of order 0.02. The simulations show that the
major advantage of using the MLP-NN is better computational performance, since
the analyses have similar quality. The CPU-time cycle assimilation with MLP-NN
is 90 times faster than cycle assimilation with LETKF for the numerical

photon as a function of the positions of the emitter and the receiver in a
large class of static, spherically symmetric spacetimes. Such a function -
often called time transfer function - is of crucial interest for testing metric
theories of gravity in the solar system. Until very recently, this function was
known only up to the second order in the Newtonian gravitational constant $G$
for a 3-parameter family of static, spherically symmetric metrics generalizing
the Schwarzschild metric. We present here two procedures enabling to determine
- at least in principle - the time transfer function at any order of
approximation when the components of the metric are expressible in power series
of the Schwarzschild radius of the central body divided by the radial
coordinate. These procedures exclusively work for light rays which may be
described as perturbations in power series in $G$ of a Minkowskian null
geodesic passing through the positions of the emitter and the receiver. It is
shown that the two methodologies lead to the same expression for the time
transfer function up to the third order in $G$. The second procedure presents
the advantage of exclusively needing elementary integrations which may be
performed with any symbolic computer program whatever the order of
approximation. The vector functions characterizing the direction of light
propagation at the points of emission and reception are derived up to the third
order in $G$. The relevance of the third order terms in the time transfer
function is briefly discussed for some solar system experiments.

bio-inspired algorithms such as the genetic algorithms and differential

famous bio-inspired algorithms, to set weights to the different segments in the
symbolic aggregate approximation representation. In this paper we present, in
two different approaches, a new meta optimization process that produces optimal
locations of the breakpoints in addition to optimal weights of the segments.
The experiments of time series classification task that we conducted show an
interesting example of how the overfitting phenomenon, a frequently encountered
problem in data mining which happens when the model overfits the training set,
can interfere in the optimization process and hide the superior performance of
an optimization algorithm.

for a range of biological and synthetic materials. While long-standing
theoretical approaches have addressed the problem of inter-filament forces from
the limit of infinitely rigid rods, the ability of flexible filaments to deform
intra-filament shape in response to changes in inter-filament geometry has a
profound affect on the nature of cohesive interactions. In this paper, we study
two theoretical models of inter-filament cohesion in the opposite limit, in
which filaments are sufficiently flexible to maintain cohesive contact along
their contours, and address, in particular, the role played by
helical-interfilament geometry in defining interactions. Specifically, we study
models of featureless, tubular filaments interacting via 1) pair-wise
Lennard-Jones (LJ) interactions between surface elements and 2)
depletion-induced filament binding stabilized by electrostatic surface
repulsion. Analysis of these models reveals a universal preference for cohesive
filament interactions for non-zero helical skew, and further, that in the
asymptotic limit of vanishing interaction range relative to filament diameter,
the skew-dependence of cohesion approaches a geometrically defined limit
described purely by the close-packing geometry of twisted tubular filaments. We
further analyze non-universal features of the skew-dependence of cohesion at
small-twist for both potentials, and argue that in the LJ model the pair-wise
surface attraction generically destabilizes parallel filaments, while in the
second model, pair-wise electrostatic repulsion in combination with
non-pairwise additivity of depletion leads to a meta-stable parallel state.

initially proposed for exactly this purpose. Together with the standard
collapse postulate, fundamentally semi-classical gravity gives rise to
superluminal signalling. A consistent fundamentally semi-classical theory of

identifying biomolecules whose function should be therapeutically altered in

silico target identification using Boolean network attractors. It assumes that
attractors of dynamical systems, such as Boolean networks, correspond to
phenotypes produced by the modeled biological system. Under this assumption,
and given a Boolean network modeling a pathophysiology, the algorithm
identifies target combinations able to remove attractors associated with
pathological phenotypes. It is tested on a Boolean model of the mammalian cell
cycle bearing a constitutive inactivation of the retinoblastoma protein, as
seen in cancers, and its applications are illustrated on a Boolean model of
Fanconi anemia. The results show that the algorithm returns target combinations
able to remove attractors associated with pathological phenotypes and then
succeeds in performing the proposed in silico target identification. However,
as with any in silico evidence, there is a bridge to cross between theory and
practice, thus requiring it to be used in combination with wet lab experiments.
Nevertheless, it is expected that the algorithm is of interest for target
identification, notably by exploiting the inexpensiveness and predictive power
of computational approaches to optimize the efficiency of costly wet lab
experiments.

infer activity propagation between the activities of different neurons. The

characterized in terms of connectivity and node centralities. We applied our
approach to calcium transients recorded at low frequency (4 Hz) in ventral
neurons of the zebrafish spinal cord at the embryonic stage when spontaneous

flexural phonons in a metallic membrane like graphene, looking for the effects
deriving from the strong interaction between the electronic excitations and

the phonon self-energy, we show that the theory has a critical point
characterized by the vanishing of the effective bending rigidity of the
membrane at low momentum. We also check that the instability in the sector of
flexural phonons takes place without the development of an in-plane static
distortion, which is avoided due to the significant reduction of the
electron-phonon couplings for in-plane phonons at large momenta. Furthermore,
we analyze the scaling properties of the many-body theory to identify the order
parameter that opens up at the point of the transition. We find that the
vanishing of the effective bending rigidity and the onset of a nonzero
expectation value of the mean curvature are concurrent manifestations of the
critical behavior. The results presented here imply that, even in the absence
of tension, the theory has a critical point at which the flat geometry becomes
an unstable configuration of the metallic membrane, with a condensation of the
mean curvature field that may well reproduce the smooth distribution of ripples
observed in free-standing graphene.

energetic phenomena such as solar flares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs). At
low radio frequencies (<100 MHz), the Sun has not been imaged extensively
because of the instrumental limitations of previous radio telescopes. Here, the
combined high spatial, spectral and temporal resolution of the Low Frequency
Array (LOFAR) was used to study solar Type III radio bursts at 30-90 MHz and
their association with CMEs. The Sun was imaged with 126 simultaneous
tied-array beams within 5 solar radii of the solar centre. This method offers
benefits over standard interferometric imaging since each beam produces high
temporal (83 ms) and spectral resolution (12.5 kHz) dynamic spectra at an array
of spatial locations centred on the Sun. LOFAR's standard interferometric
output is currently limited to one image per second. Over a period of 30
minutes, multiple Type III radio bursts were observed, a number of which were
found to be located at high altitudes (4 solar radii from the solar center at
30 MHz) and to have non-radial trajectories. These bursts occurred at altitudes
in excess of values predicted by 1D radial electron density models. The
non-radial high altitude Type III bursts were found to be associated with the
expanding flank of a CME. The CME may have compressed neighbouring streamer
plasma producing larger electron densities at high altitudes, while the
non-radial burst trajectories can be explained by the deflection of radial
magnetic fields as the CME expanded in the low corona.

in which light in-coupling, out-coupling or rejection is crucial, such as
lasing, sensing, photovoltaics and information and communication technology.
For this purpose, Bragg mirrors, band-pass filters with high reflectivity
represent good candidates. However, their optical characteristics are
determined at the stage of fabrication. Heavily doped semiconductor
nanocrystals (NCs) on the other hand deliver a high degree of optical
tunability through the active modulation of their carrier density ultimately
influencing their plasmonic absorption properties. Here, we propose the design
of a tunable light filter composed of a Bragg mirror and a layer of plasmonic
semiconductor NCs. We demonstrate that the filtering properties of the coupled
device can be tuned to cover a wide range of frequencies from the visible to
the near infrared (vis-NIR) spectral region when employing varying carrier
densities. As tunable component we implemented a dispersion of copper selenide
(Cu2-xSe) NCs and a film of indium tin oxide (ITO) NCs, which are known to show
optical tunablility by chemical or electrochemical treatments. We utilized the
Mie theory to describe the carrier dependent plasmonic properties of the
Cu2-xSe NC dispersion and the effective medium theory to describe the optical
characteristics of the ITO film. The transmission properties of the Bragg
mirror have been modelled with the transfer matrix method. We foresee ease of
experimental realization of the coupled device, where filtering modulation is
achieved upon chemical and electrochemical post-fabrication treatment of the
heavily doped semiconductor NC component, eventually resulting in tunable
transmission properties of the coupled device.

that lead to a scrambled intensity profile. In previous work, the correction of
such distortions using various wavefront control methods has been demonstrated
in the continuous wave case. However, in the ultra-fast pulse regime, modal
dispersion temporally broadens a pulse after propagation. Here, we present a
method that compensates for spatial distortions and mitigates temporal
broadening due to modal dispersion by a selective phase conjugation process in
which only modes of similar group velocities are excited. The selectively
excited modes are forced to follow certain paths through the multimode fiber
and interfere constructively at the distal tip to form a focused spot with
minimal temporal broadening. We demonstrate the delivery of focused 500 fs
pulses through a 30 cm long step-index multimode fiber. The achieved pulse
duration corresponds to approximately 1/30th of the duration obtained if modal
dispersion was not controlled. Moreover, we measured a detailed two-dimensional
map of the pulse duration at the output of the fiber and confirmed that the
focused spot produces a two-photon absorption effect. This work opens new
possibilities for ultra-thin multiphoton imaging through multimode fibers.

periodically driven slow-fast host-parasite system of equations for a slow
flukes population and a fast Unikaryon hyperparasite population. The model
exhibits two branches of the critical curve crossing in a transcritical
bifurcation scenario. We discuss two thresholds due to immediate and delayed
exchange of stability effects; and we derive algebraic relationships for
parameters of the periodic solution in the limit of the infinite ratio of the
time scales. Flukes parasitise cockles and in turn are hyperparasitised by the
microsporidian Unikaryon legeri; the life cycle of flukes includes several life
stages and a number of different hosts. That is, the flukes-hyperparasite
system in a cockle is part of a larger estuarine ecosystem of species involving
parasites, shellfish and birds which prey on shellfish. A population dynamics
model which accounts for such multi-species interactions and includes the
fluke-hyperparasite model in a cockle as a subsystem is presented. We provide
evidence that the threshold effect we observed in the flukes-hyperparasite
subsystem remains apparent in the multi-species system. Assuming that flukes
damage cockles, and taking into account that the hyperparasite is detrimental
to flukes, it is natural to suggest that the hyperparasitism may support the
abundance of cockles and, thereby, the persistence of the ecosystem, including
shellfish and birds. We confirm the possibility of this scenario in our model
by removing the hyperparasite and demonstrating that this may result in a
substantial drop in cockle numbers. The result indicates a possible significant
role for the microparasite in this estuarine ecosystem.

source for presence detection. We conduct pilot experiments in an office

tedious and time consuming, PresenceSense outperforms popular models whose

significantly increasing the small amount of mid-/high-J CO line data available

is expected from the (also) linear FIR-(molecular line) relations found for the
dense gas tracer lines (HCN and CS), as long as the dense gas mass fraction
does not vary strongly within our (merger/starburst)-dominated sample. However
from J=6-5 and up to J=13-12 we find an increasingly sub-linear slope and
higher normalization constant with increasing J. We argue that these are caused
by a warm (~100K) and dense ($>10^4{\rm cm^{-3}}$) gas component whose thermal
state is unlikely to be maintained by star formation powered far-UV radiation
fields (and thus is no longer directly tied to the star formation rate). We
suggest that mechanical heating (e.g., supernova driven turbulence and shocks),
and not cosmic rays, is the more likely source of energy for this component.
The global CO spectral line energy distributions (SLEDs), which remain highly
excited from J=6-5 up to J=13-12, are found to be a generic feature of the
(U)LIRGs in our sample, and further support the presence of this gas component.

estimating a posterior distribution $\pi(x_{n}|y_{1},y_{2}, \ldots, y_{n})$
where the $\{Y_{n}\}$ are observations related to the $\{X_{n}\}$ through some

$\{X_{n}\}$ is a Markov chain as well as for more general state space models.
  Existing particle filtering algorithms are extremely fast and easy to
implement. Although they suffer from issues of degeneracy and ""sample

are excellent tools for inference. However, if one wishes to sample from a
posterior distribution of interest, a particle filter is only able to produce
dependent draws. Particle smoothing algorithms are complicated and far less

an alternative algorithm for both filtering and smoothing that is based on

(LSH) algorithms for large-scale data processing applications. Deciding which
LSH to use for a particular problem at hand is an important question, which has
no clear answer in the existing literature. In this study, we provide a
theoretical answer (validated by experiments) that MinHash virtually always
outperforms SimHash when the data are binary, as common in practice such as
search.
  The collision probability of MinHash is a function of resemblance similarity
($\mathcal{R}$), while the collision probability of SimHash is a function of
cosine similarity ($\mathcal{S}$). To provide a common basis for comparison, we
evaluate retrieval results in terms of $\mathcal{S}$ for both MinHash and
SimHash. This evaluation is valid as we can prove that MinHash is a valid LSH
with respect to $\mathcal{S}$, by using a general inequality $\mathcal{S}^2\leq
\mathcal{R}\leq \frac{\mathcal{S}}{2-\mathcal{S}}$. Our worst case analysis can
show that MinHash significantly outperforms SimHash in high similarity region.
  Interestingly, our intensive experiments reveal that MinHash is also
substantially better than SimHash even in datasets where most of the data
points are not too similar to each other. This is partly because, in practical
data, often $\mathcal{R}\geq \frac{\mathcal{S}}{z-\mathcal{S}}$ holds where $z$
is only slightly larger than 2 (e.g., $z\leq 2.1$). Our restricted worst case
analysis by assuming $\frac{\mathcal{S}}{z-\mathcal{S}}\leq \mathcal{R}\leq
\frac{\mathcal{S}}{2-\mathcal{S}}$ shows that MinHash indeed significantly
outperforms SimHash even in low similarity region.
  We believe the results in this paper will provide valuable guidelines for

1994, but the K-band flux has increased by 0.9 mags since 1998. The veiling of
UY Aur B has also increased significantly. These data evince a much more
luminous disk around UY Aur B. If the lower Br{\gamma} luminosity observed in
the spectrum of UY Aur B indicates an intrinsically smaller accretion rate onto
the star, then UY Aur A now accretes at a higher rate than UY Aur B. However,
extinction at small radii or mass pile-up in the circumstellar disk could
explain decreased Br{\gamma} emission around UY Aur B even when the disk
luminosity implies an increased accretion rate. In addition to our scientific
results for the UY Aur system, we discuss a dedicated pipeline we have
developed for the reduction of echelle-mode data from the ARIES spectrograph.

irreversibility as the failure of searching for a disentangling circuit using a

Wigner-Dyson statistics in the level spacing of the entanglement eigenvalues,
and that this is obtained from a quantum circuit made from a set of universal
gates for quantum computation. If, on the other hand, the system is evolved

dealing with a nonlinear formulation of the NMF. Within the framework of kernel

different kernel functions, we describe two schemes for iterative algorithms:
an additive update rule based on a gradient descent scheme and a multiplicative
update rule in the same spirit as in the Lee and Seung algorithm. Within the
proposed framework, we develop several extensions to incorporate constraints,
including sparseness, smoothness, and spatial regularization with a
total-variation-like penalty. The effectiveness of the proposed method is
demonstrated with the problem of unmixing hyperspectral images, using
well-known real images and results with state-of-the-art techniques.

able to run 2D axisymmetric GRRMHD simulations of accretion disks for
arbitrarily long times. The simulated disks exhibit sustained turbulence, with
the poloidal and toroidal magnetic field components driven towards a state
similar to that seen in 3D studies. Using this dynamo code, we present a set of
long-duration global simulations of super-Eddington, optically-thick disks
around non-spinning and spinning black holes. Super-Eddington disks around
non-rotating black holes exhibit a surprisingly large efficiency,
$\eta\approx0.04$, independent of the accretion rate, where we measure
efficiency in terms of the total energy output, both radiation and mechanical,
flowing out to infinity. Super-Eddington disks around spinning black holes are
even more efficient, and appear to extract black hole rotational energy through
a process similar to the Blandford-Znajek mechanism. All the simulated models
are characterized by highly super-Eddington radiative fluxes collimated along
the rotation axis. We also present a set of simulations that were designed to
have Eddington or slightly sub-Eddington accretion rates ($\dot{M} \lesssim

filled with superfluid helium, through a sample cell filled with solid helium,
to another superfluid-filled reservoir until chemical potential equilibrium is
restored. The solid helium sample is separated from each of the reservoirs by
Vycor rods that allow only the superfluid component to flow. With an improved
technique, measurements of the flow, $F$, at several fixed solid helium
temperatures, $T$, have been made as function of $\Delta \mu$ in the pressure
range 25.5 - 26.1 bar. And, measurements of $F$ have been made as a function of
temperature in the range $180 < T < 545$~mK for several fixed values of $\Delta

of the flux with an increase in temperature that is well described by $F =
F_0^*[1 - a\exp(-E/T)]$. The non-linear functional dependence $F \sim (\Delta

dimensional reduction. However, traditional Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)

distribution. The Bregman Divergence was recently introduced to achieve a
generalized PCA framework. If the random variable under dimensional reduction
follows Bernoulli distribution, which occurs in many emerging fields, the
generalized PCA is called Logistic PCA (LPCA). In this paper, we extend the
batch LPCA to a sequential version (i.e. SLPCA), based on the sequential convex
optimization theory. The convergence property of this algorithm is discussed
compared to the batch version of LPCA (i.e. BLPCA), as well as its performance
in reducing the dimension for multivariate binary-state systems. Its
application in building energy end-use profile modeling is also investigated.

proven useful in many different contexts in statistics and machine learning.
Whereas the achievable limit in terms of regret minimization is now well known,
our aim is to contribute to a better understanding of the performance in terms

the two dominant frameworks considered in the literature: fixed-budget and
fixed-confidence settings. In the fixed-confidence setting, we provide the
first known distribution-dependent lower bound on the complexity that involves
information-theoretic quantities and holds when m is larger than 1 under
general assumptions. In the specific case of two armed-bandits, we derive
refined lower bounds in both the fixed-confidence and fixed-budget settings,
along with matching algorithms for Gaussian and Bernoulli bandit models. These
results show in particular that the complexity of the fixed-budget setting may
be smaller than the complexity of the fixed-confidence setting, contradicting
the familiar behavior observed when testing fully specified alternatives. In
addition, we also provide improved sequential stopping rules that have
guaranteed error probabilities and shorter average running times. The proofs
rely on two technical results that are of independent interest : a deviation

of very large (> 1 micron) grains, which are resistant to destructive
processes. At later times (500-900 days), the near-IR thermal emission shows an

ultraviolet to near-infrared individual and stacked spectral energy
distributions, we have independently estimated the stellar ages of our

differences in the TiO$_2$ feature as an IMF variation. In particular, for the
heaviest z$\sim$1 MQGs (M$>$10$^{11}$Msun) we find an average age of
1.7$\pm$0.3 Gyr and a bottom-heavy IMF ($\Gamma_b$=3.2$\pm$0.2). Lighter MQGs
(2$\times$10$^{10}$$<$M$<$10$^{11}$ Msun) at the same redshift are younger on

findings about the IMF slope in early-type galaxies of similar mass in the

events consistent with being optically-obscured ""dark"" bursts. Our overall
detection fraction implies that between 9-23% of GRBs between 0.5 < z < 2.5
occur in galaxies with S_3GHz > 10 uJy, corresponding to SFR >50 Msun/yr at z~1

cosmic star-formation, so our results are consistent with a GRB rate which is
not strongly biased with respect to the total star-formation rate of a galaxy.
However, all four radio-detected hosts have modest stellar masses (~few x 10^10
Msun), significantly lower than IR/submillimeter-selected field galaxies of

sufficiently dense to be rocky, as a function of planet radius. We show that
the majority of 1.6 Earth-radius planets are too low density to be comprised of
Fe and silicates alone. At larger radii, the constraints on the fraction of
rocky planets are even more stringent. These insights into the size
demographics of rocky and volatile-rich planets offer empirical constraints to
planet formation theories, and guide the range of planet radii to be considered

stellar-mass black hole (BH) binaries co-existing in a globular cluster with an
intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH)? Our results suggest that the detection of
one or more BH binaries can strongly constrain the presence of an IMBH in most
Galactic globular clusters. More specifically, the detection of one or more BH
binaries could strongly indicate against the presence of an IMBH more massive
than $\gtrsim 10^3$ M$_{\rm \odot}$ in roughly 80\% of the clusters in our
sample. To illustrate this, we use a combination of N-body simulations and
analytic methods to weigh the rate of formation of BH binaries against their
ejection and/or disruption rate via strong gravitational interactions with the
central (most) massive BH.
  The eventual fate of a sub-population of stellar-mass BHs (with or without
binary companions) is for all BHs to be ejected from the cluster by the central
IMBH, leaving only the most massive stellar-mass BH behind to form a close
binary with the IMBH. During each phase of evolution, we discuss the rate of
inspiral of the central BH-BH pair as a function of both the properties of the
binary and its host cluster.

formation, with the youngest stars having ages of 7.5 +/- 2.0 Myr and
metallicities of 0.4 +/- 0.2 Zsun. The latter is consistent with the local
metallicity of the intracluster medium. We detect the O VI (1038) line,
measuring a flux of 4.0 +/- 0.9 x 10^-17 erg s^-1 cm^-2. The O VI (1032) line
is redshifted such that it is coincident with a strong Galactic H2 absorption
feature, and is not detected. The measured O VI (1038) flux corresponds to a
cooling rate of 0.85 +/- 0.2 (stat) +/- 0.15 (sys) Msun/yr at ~10^5.5 K,
assuming that the cooling proceeds isochorically, which is consistent with the
classical X-ray luminosity-derived cooling rate in the same region. We measure
a star formation rate of 0.11 +/- 0.02 Msun/yr from the UV continuum,

increased dramatically. These surveys have revealed the Triangulum-Andromeda
(TriAnd) region to be rich with substructure in the distance range 20-30 kpc,
and the relation of these features to each other -- if any -- remains unclear.
This complex situation motivates this re-examination of the TriAnd region with
a photometric and spectroscopic survey of M giants. An exploration using 2MASS
photometry reveals not only the faint sequence in M giants detected by
Rocha-Pinto et al. (2004) spanning the range $100^{\circ}<l<160^{\circ}$ and
$-50^{\circ}<b<-15^{\circ}$ but, in addition, a second, brighter and more
densely populated M giant sequence. These two sequences are likely associated
with the two distinct main-sequences discovered (and labeled TriAnd1 and
TriAnd2) by Martin et al. (2007) in an optical survey in the direction of M31,
where TriAnd2 is the optical counterpart of the fainter RGB/AGB sequence of
Rocha-Pinto et al. (2004). Here, the age, distance, and metallicity ranges for
TriAnd1 and TriAnd2 are estimated by simultaneously fitting isochrones to the
2MASS RGB tracks and the optical MS/MSTO features. The two populations are
clearly distinct in age and distance: the brighter sequence (TriAnd1) is
younger (6-10 Gyr) and closer (distance of $\sim$ 15-21 kpc), while the fainter
sequence (TriAnd2) is older (10-12 Gyr) and is at an estimated distance of
$\sim$ 24-32 kpc. A comparison with simulations demonstrates that the
differences and similarities between TriAnd1 and TriAnd2 can simultaneously be
explained if they represent debris originating from the disruption of the same
dwarf galaxy, but torn off during two distinct pericentric passages. [Abridged]

the presence of any correlation with the accretion state has not been
previously tested. We have studied EXO 0748-676, a transient neutron star

He, and H$_2$. The direct collapse model requires that the gas cools
predominantly via atomic hydrogen. To this end we simulate the effect of an
anisotropic radiation source on the collapse of a halo at high redshift. The
radiation source is placed at a distance of 3 kpc (physical) from the
collapsing object. The source is set to emit monochromatically in the center of
the Lyman-Werner (LW) band only at $12.8 \ \rm{eV}$. The LW radiation emitted
from the high redshift source is followed self-consistently using ray tracing
techniques. We find that, due to self-shielding, a small amount of H$_2$ is
able to form at the very center of the collapsing halo even under very strong

results display significant differences, compared to the isotropic radiation

Langmuir-Hinshelwood mechanism, it remains computationally expensive, and
accurate approximations are constructed. We find the Langmuir-Hinshelwood
mechanism to become an efficient formation mechanism in unshielded photon

account, despite hot average dust temperatures. It reaches an importance
comparable to the Eley-Rideal mechanism. However, we show that a simpler rate
equation treatment gives qualitatively correct observable results in full cloud

afterglow produced by synchrotron emission from the forward shock resulting
from the interaction of this ejecta with the circum-burst matter. We assess
whether this emission can produce the observed radio and X-ray afterglows of
the available sample of 4 llGRBs. All 4 radio afterglows can be explained
within this model, providing further support for shock breakouts being the
origin of llGRBs. We find that in one of the llGRBs (GRB 031203) the predicted
X-ray emission, using the same parameters that fit the radio, can explain the
observed one. In another one (GRB 980425) the observed X-rays can be explained
if we allow for a slight modification of the simplest model. For the last two
cases (GRBs 060218 and 100316D), we find that, as is the case for previous
attempts to model these afterglows, the simplest model that fits the radio
emission underpredicts the observed X-ray afterglows. Using general arguments,
we show that the most natural location of the X-ray source is, like the radio
source, within the ejecta-external medium interaction layer but that emission
is due to a different population of electrons or to a different emission
process.

understanding properties of the Higgs and potential new physics. In this paper
we investigate the effects of NNLL transverse momentum resummation in measuring
the W^+W^- cross section. In the formalism we employ, transverse momentum
resummation does not change the total inclusive cross section, but gives a more
accurate prediction for the p_T distribution of the diboson system. By
re-weighting the p_T distribution of events produced by Monte Carlo generators,
we find a systematic shift that decreases the experimental discrepancy with the
SM prediction by approximately 3-7% depending on the MC generator and parton
shower used. The primary effect comes from the jet veto cut used by both
experiments. We comment on the connections to jet veto resummation, and other
methods the experiments can use to test this effect. We also discuss the
correlation of resummation effects in this channel with other diboson channels.
Ultimately p_T resummation improves the agreement between the SM and
experimental measurements for most generators, but does not account for the
measured ~20% difference with the SM and further investigations into this
channel are needed.

within the bandgap. Similar strong correlations can affect or even destabilize
the two-dimensional metallic state of topological origin at the crystal

the boundary metal can exhibit a varied degree of hybridization between the $d$

expected to create a heavy fermion Dirac metal, possibly unstable to a spin
density wave, electron localization or even superconductivity. The opposite

the crystal boundary can bring about a non-Fermi liquid of $d$ electrons that
exhibits two-dimensional quantum electrodynamics, or other unconventional

consider a reconstruction formula studied in some previous works, under the
assumption that the data is only smoothened out to a finite order $k$ near the

(where $n$ denotes the size of the network). The deterministic online algorithm
is centralized and handles packets with deadlines. This algorithm is applicable
to various ranges of values of buffer sizes and communication link capacities.
In particular, it holds for buffer size and communication link capacity in the
range $[3 \ldots \log n]$.
  Our randomized algorithm achieves an expected competitive ratio of $O(\log
n)$ for the uni-directional line. This algorithm is applicable to a wide range
of buffer sizes and communication link capacities. In particular, it holds also
for unit size buffers and unit capacity links. This algorithm improves the best
previous $O(\log^2 n)$-competitive ratio of Azar and Zachut \cite{AZ}.

collisionless shocks is whether electrons and ions each establish their own
post-shock temperature, or whether they quickly equilibrate in the shock
region. Here we provide simple relations for the minimal amount of
equilibration to expect. The basic assumption is that the enthalpy-flux of the
electrons is conserved separately, but that all particle species should undergo
the same density jump across the the shock. This assumption results in an
analytic treatment of electron-ion equilibration that agrees with observations
of collisionless shocks: at low Mach numbers ($<2$) the electrons and ions are
close to equilibration, whereas for Mach numbers above $M \sim 60$ the
electron-ion temperature ratio scales with the particle masses $T_e/T_i =
m_e/m_i$. In between these two extremes the electron-ion temperature ratio
scales as $T_e/T_i \propto 1/M_s^2$. This relation also hold if adiabatic
compression of the electrons is taken into account. For magnetised plasmas the
compression is governed by the magnetosonic Mach number, whereas the
electron-ion temperatures are governed by the sonic Mach number. The derived
equations are in agreement with observational data at low Mach numbers, but for
supernova remnants the relation requires that the inferred Mach numbers for the
observations are over- estimated, perhaps as a result of upstream heating in
the cosmic-ray precursor. In addition to predicting a minimal electron/ion
temperature ratio, we also heuristically incorporate ion-electron heat exchange
at the shock, quantified with a dimensionless parameter ${\xi}$. Comparing the
model to existing observations in the solar system and supernova remnants
suggests that the data are best described by ${\xi} \sim 5$ percent. (Abridged

linear through the entire range of L_IR and z probed and, although broadly
consistent with the local (z<0.1) one, it does display some discrepancies. We
suggest that these discrepancies are unlikely to be physical, i.e. due to an
intrinsic change in the X-ray properties of star-forming galaxies with cosmic
time, as there is no significant evidence for evolution of the L_X/L_IR ratio
with redshift. Instead they are possibly due to selection effects and remaining
AGN contamination. We also examine whether dust obscuration in the galaxy plays
a role in attenuating X-rays from star-formation, by investigating changes in
the L_X/L_IR ratio as a function of the average dust temperature. We conclude
that X-rays do not suffer any measurable attenuation in the host galaxy.

distributions in the inner solar system. These data indicate that the Moon and
the terrestrial planets have been bombarded by two populations of objects.
Population 1, dominating at early times, had nearly the same size distribution
as the present-day asteroid belt, and produced the heavily cratered surfaces
with a complex, multi-sloped crater size-frequency distribution. Population 2,
dominating since about 3.8-3.7 Ga, has the same size distribution as near-Earth
objects (NEOs), had a much lower impact flux, and produced a crater size
distribution characterized by a differential -3 single-slope power law in the
crater diameter range 0.02 km to 100 km. Taken together with the results from a
large body of work on age-dating of lunar and meteorite samples and theoretical
work in solar system dynamics, a plausible interpretation of these data is as
follows. The NEO population is the source of Population 2 and it has been in
near-steady state over the past ~3.7-3.8 gigayears; these objects are derived
from the main asteroid belt by size-dependent non-gravitational effects that
favor the ejection of smaller asteroids. However, Population 1 were main belt
asteroids ejected from their source region in a size-independent manner,
possibly by means of gravitational resonance sweeping during giant planet orbit
migration; this caused the so-called Late Heavy Bombardment (LHB). The LHB
began some time before ~3.9 Ga, peaked and declined rapidly over the next ~100
to 300 megayears, and possibly more slowly from about 3.8-3.7 Ga to ~2 Ga. A
third crater population (Population S) consists of secondary impact craters
that can dominate the cratering record at small diameters.

operating speed are obtained by statistical estimation for different rainfall
intensity categories against clear weather. Then the modified speed-density

theoretical Hertzsprung-Russell diagram (i.e. log (L/L&sun;) vs. log Te),
rather than in the conventional colour-magnitude diagram, can provide more
precise and accurate cluster ages, with well-defined uncertainties. Results:
Well-defined ages are found for all the clusters studied. For the nearby
clusters studied, the derived ages are not very sensitive to the small
uncertainties in distance, reddening, membership, metallicity, or choice of
isochrones. Our age determinations are all within the range of previously
determined values, but the associated uncertainties are considerably smaller
than the spread in recent age determinations from the literature. Furthermore,
examination of proper motions and HR diagrams confirms that the Ap stars
identified in these clusters are members, and that the presently accepted
temperature scale and bolometric corrections for Ap stars are approximately
correct. We show that in these theoretical HR diagrams blue stragglers are
particularly easy to identify. Conclusions: Constructing the theoretical HR
diagram of a nearby open cluster makes possible an accurate age determination,
with well defined uncertainty. This diagnostic of a cluster also provides a
useful tool for studying unusual stars such as Ap stars and blue stragglers.

surface of LuFe2O4 reveals that both domains have irregular patterns of similar
shape, but the length scales are quite different. The domain size is
approximately 100 nm for the ferroelectric domains while the magnetic domain
size is much larger and gets as large as 1{\mu}m. We also demonstrate that the
origin of the formation of irregular domains in LuFe2O4 is not extrinsic but
intrinsic.

exhibiting a mild excess beyond the SM prediction, in both ATLAS and CMS at
both 7-TeV and 8-TeV runs. We provide an explanation of the excess in terms of
resummation of large logarithms that arise from a jet-veto condition, i.e., the
rejection of high-pT jets with pT > pT(veto) that is imposed in the
experimental analyses to reduce backgrounds. Jet veto introduces a second mass
scale pT(veto) to the problem in addition to the invariant mass of the WW pair.
This gives rise to large logarithms of the ratio of the two scales that need to
be resummed. Such resummation may not be properly accounted for by the Monte
Carlo simulations used in the ATLAS and CMS studies. Those logarithms are also
accompanied by large pi^2 terms when the standard, positive sign is chosen for
the squared renormalization scale. We analytically resum the large logarithms
including the pi^2 terms in the framework of soft collinear effective theory
(SCET), and demonstrate that the SCET calculation not only reduces the scale
uncertainties of the SM prediction significantly but also renders the theory
prediction well compatible with the experiment. We find that resummation of the
large logarithms and that of the pi^2 terms are both comparably important.

globular clusters (GCs) by enhancing the mass loss of primary star during
binary evolution. Lei et al. (2013a, 2013b) studied the effect of this kind of
wind on HB morphology in details, and their results indicated that binary is a
possible secondparameter (2P) candidate in GCs. Binary fraction is an very
important fact in the tidally-enhanced-stellar-wind model. In this paper, we
studied the effect of binary fraction on HB morphology by removing the effects
of metallicity and age. Five different binary fractions (i.e., 10%, 15%, 20%,
30% and 50%) are adopted in our model calculations. The synthetic HB
morphologies with different binary fractions are obtained at different
metallicities and ages. We found that, due to the great influence of
metallicity and age, the effect of binary fraction on HB morphology may be
masked by these two parameters. However, when the effects of metallicity and
age are removed, the tendency that HB morphologies become bluer with increasing
of binary fractions is clearly presented. Furthermore, we compared our results
with the observation by Milone et al. (2012). Our results are consistent well
with the observation at metalrich and metal-poor GCs. For the GCs with
intermediate metallicity, when the effect of age on HB morphology is removed, a
weak tendency that HB morphologies become bluer with increasing of binary
fractions is presented in all regions of GCs, which is consistent with our
results obtained in this metallicity range.

structures associated with the interaction are observed in the ambient frame.
When open boundaries are employed in the direction of the jet; the forward
shock is seen as a hybrid structure consisting of an electrostatic shock
combined with a double layer, while the reverse shock is seen as a double
layer. The ambient ions show two distinct features across the forward shock: a
population penetrating into the shocked region from the precursor region and an
accelerated population escaping from the shocked region into the precursor
region. This behavior is a signature of a combination of an electrostatic shock
and a double layer. Jet electrons are seen to be electrostatically trapped
between the forward and reverse shock structures showing a ring-like
distribution in a phase-space plot, while ambient electrons are thermalized and
become essentially isotropic in the shocked region. The magnetic energy density
grows to a few percent of the jet kinetic energy density at both the forward
and the reverse shock transition layers in a rather short time scale. We see
little disturbance of the jet ions over this time scale.

cores and tracked through the simulation. The colliding system showed a partial
gas arc morphology with core formation in the oblique shock-front at the
collision interface. These characteristics support NANTEN observations of
objects suspected to be colliding giant molecular clouds (GMCs). We
investigated the effect of turbulence and collision speed on the resulting core
population and compared the cumulative mass distribution to cores in observed
GMCs. Our results suggest that a faster relative velocity increases the number
of cores formed but that cores grow via accretion predominately while in the
shock front, leading to a slower shock being more important for core growth.
The core masses obey a power law relation with index gamma = -1.6, in good
agreement with observations. This suggests that core production through
collisions should follow a similar mass distribution as quiescent formation,
albeit at a higher mass range. If cores can be supported against collapse
during their growth, the estimated ram pressure from gas infall is of the right
order to counter the radiation pressure and form a star of 100Msun.

consistent with an universal IMF, and stochastic sampling of the stellar
populations in the $\lessapprox$ 10$^{3}$ Msun clusters are responsible for any
deviations in this universality. The ensemble cluster population, as well as
individual clusters, also imply that the most massive star in a cluster does
not depend on the cluster mass. In fact, we have found that these small
clusters seem to have an over-abundance of ionizing photons when compared to an
expected universal or truncated IMF. This also suggests that the presence of
massive stars in these clusters does not affect the star formation in a
destructive way.

  Programs",,,,,"cs.DM cs.LO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We present the notion of asymptotically non-terminating initial variable
values for linear loop programs. Those values are directly associated to
initial variable values for which the corresponding program does not terminate.
Our theoretical contributions provide us with powerful computational methods
for automatically generating sets of asymptotically non-terminating initial
variable values. Such sets are represented symbolically and exactly by a
semi-linear space, e.g., characterized by conjunctions and disjunctions of
linear equalities and inequalities. Moreover, by taking their complements, we
obtain a precise under-approximation of the set of inputs for which the program
does terminate. We can then reduce the termination problem of linear programs
to the emptiness check of a specific set of asymptotically non-terminating
initial variable values. Our static input data analysis is not restricted only
to programs where the variables are interpreted over the reals. We extend our
approach and provide new decidability results for the termination problem of
affine integer and rational programs.

easier to propagate along a wire. Following fascinating results on DW dynamics
are found. 1) The depinning current density of a DW in a notch is substantially
lower than the intrinsic threshold value below which a sustainable DW
propagation doesn't exist in a homogeneous wire. 2) The DW displacement from a
notch is insensitive to notch geometry and current density when it is between
the depinning and the intrinsic threshold current density. 3) A current density
below the intrinsic threshold value can induce a sustainable DW propagation
along notched nanowires. These findings not only reveal interesting and

(CS) disks are clearly resolved in dust continuum at 1.4 mm. The spectral
indices between the wavelengths of 0.85 mm and 6 cm are found to be
surprisingly low, being 1.6 for both CS disks. The deprojected separation of
the binary is 1.26"" based on our 1.4 mm continuum data. This is 0.07"" (10 AU)
larger than in earlier studies. Combining the fact of the variation of UY Aur B
in $R$ band, we propose that the CS disk of an undetected companion UY Aur Bb
obscures UY Aur Ba. A very complex kinematical pattern inside the CB disk is
observed due to a mixing of Keplerian rotation of the CB disk, the infall and
outflow gas. The streaming gas accreting from the CB ring toward the CS disks
and possible outflows are also identified and resolved. The SO emission is
found to be at the bases of the streaming shocks. Our results suggest that the

super-AGB stars, are thought to produce supernovae (SNe) triggered by electron
captures in their degenerate O+Ne+Mg cores. Super-AGB stars are expected to
have slow winds with high mass-loss rates, so their wind density is high. The
explosions of super-AGB stars are therefore presumed to occur in this dense
wind. We provide the first synthetic light curves (LCs) for such events by
exploding realistic electron-capture supernova (ecSN) progenitors within their
super-AGB winds. We find that the early LC, i.e. before the recombination wave
reaches the bottom of the H-rich envelope of SN ejecta (the plateau phase), is
not affected by the dense wind. However, after the plateau phase, the
luminosity remains higher when the super-AGB wind is taken into account. We
compare our results to the historical LC of SN 1054, the progenitor of the Crab
Nebula, and show that the explosion of an ecSN within an ordinary super-AGB
wind can explain the LC features. We conclude that SN 1054 could have been a
Type IIn SN without any extra extreme mass loss which was previously suggested
to be necessary to account for its early high luminosity. We also show that our
LCs match Type IIn SNe with an early plateau phase (`Type IIn-P') and suggest
that they are ecSNe within super-AGB winds. Although some ecSNe can be bright
in the optical spectral range due to the large progenitor radius, their X-ray
luminosity from the interaction does not necessarily get as bright as other
Type IIn SNe whose optical luminosities are also powered by the interaction.
Thus, we suggest that optically-bright X-ray-faint Type IIn SNe can emerge from
ecSNe. Optically-faint Type IIn SNe, such as SN 2008S, can also originate from
ecSNe if their H-rich envelope masses are small. Some of them can be observed
as `Type IIn-b' SNe due to the small H-rich envelope mass.

renormalization group equations are cast as Hamilton equations of radial
evolution in a model space-time of one higher dimension, in this case
$AdS_{d+1}$. The geometry associated with the RG equations is seen to emerge
naturally out of the infinite jet bundle corresponding to the field theory, and
suggests their interpretation as higher-spin equations of motion. While the
higher-spin equations we obtain are remarkably simple, they are non-local in an
essential way. Nevertheless, solving these bulk equations of motion in terms of
a boundary source, we derive the on-shell action and demonstrate that it
correctly encodes all of the correlation functions of the field theory, written
as `Witten diagrams'. Since the model space-time has the isometries of the
fixed point, it is possible to construct new higher spin theories defined in
terms of geometric structures over other model space-times. We illustrate this
by explicitly constructing the higher spin RG equations corresponding to the

tracers of the formation mechanisms and physical processes operating in these
systems. We use a sample of 34 debris disks spatially resolved in various
Herschel programs to constrain them. While we modeled disks with both warm and
cold components, we focus our analysis only on the cold outer disks, i.e.
Kuiper-belt analogs. The disk radii derived from the resolved images reveal a
large dispersion, but no significant trend with the stellar luminosity, which
argues against ice lines as a dominant player in setting the debris disk sizes.
Fixing the disk radii to those inferred from the resolved images, we model the
spectral energy distributions to determine the dust temperatures and the grain
size distributions. While the dust temperature systematically increases towards
earlier spectral types, its ratio to the blackbody temperature at the disk
radius decreases with the stellar luminosity. This is explained by an increase
of typical grain sizes towards more luminous stars. The sizes are compared to
the radiation pressure blowout limit $s_\text{blow}$ that is proportional to
the stellar luminosity-to-mass ratio and thus also increases towards earlier
spectral classes. The grain sizes in the disks of G- to A-stars are inferred to
be several times $s_\text{blow}$ at all stellar luminosities, in agreement with
collisional models of debris disks. The sizes, measured in the units of
$s_\text{blow}$, appear to decrease with the luminosity, which may be
suggestive of the disk's stirring level increasing towards earlier-type stars.

scales and have spatial resolutions of up to $1024^3$ grid points and Reynolds
numbers of $\approx 1000$. We first show that solutions with negative energy
flux and inverse cascades develop in rotating turbulence, whether or not
stratification is present. However, the purely stratified case is characterized
instead by an early-time, highly anisotropic transfer to large scales with
almost zero net isotropic energy flux. This is consistent with previous studies
that observed the development of vertically sheared horizontal winds, although
only at substantially later times. However, and unlike previous works, when
sufficient scale separation is allowed between the forcing scale and the domain
size, the total energy displays a perpendicular (horizontal) spectrum with
power law behavior compatible with $\sim k_\perp^{-5/3}$, including in the
absence of rotation. In this latter purely stratified case, such a spectrum is
the result of a direct cascade of the energy contained in the large-scale
horizontal wind, as is evidenced by a strong positive flux of energy in the
parallel direction at all scales including the largest resolved scales.

high spatial resolution and temporal stability. Fine scale structures in
sunspots, called umbral dots (UDs), have become one of the hottest topics in
terms of the close observation of the magnetoconvection.
  In this paper, a brief review of observed properties of UDs is given based on
the recent literature. UDs born in the periphery of the umbra exhibit inward
migration, and their speeds are positively correlated with the magnetic field
inclination. Longer-lasting UDs are tend to be larger and brighter, while
lifetimes of UDs show no relation with their background magnetic field
strength. UDs tend to disappear or stop its proper motion by colliding with the
locally strong field region. The spatial distribution of UD is not uniform over
an umbra but is preferably located at boundaries of cellular patterns. From our
2-dimensional correlation analysis, we measured the characteristic width of the
cell boundaries (~0.5"") and the size of the cells (~6"").
  Then we performed a simplified analysis to get statistics how the UD
distribution is random or clustered using the Hinode blue continuum images. We
find a hint that the UDs become less dense and more clustered for later phase
sunspots. These results may be related to the evolutional change of the
subsurface structure of a sunspot.
  Based on these observational results, we will discuss their physical models
by means of numerical simulations of magnetoconvection.

in, for example, searching, navigation, ranking, and community detection.
Recent recognition of the importance of temporal aspects on networks spurred
studies of random walks on temporal networks. Here we theoretically study two
types of event-driven random walks on a stochastic temporal network model that
produces arbitrary distributions of interevent-times. In the so-called active
random walk, the interevent-time is reinitialized on all links upon each
movement of the walker. In the so-called passive random walk, the
interevent-time is only reinitialized on the link that has been used last time,
and it is a type of correlated random walk. We find that the steady state is
always the uniform density for the passive random walk. In contrast, for the
active random walk, it increases or decreases with the node's degree depending
on the distribution of interevent-times. The mean recurrence time of a node is
inversely proportional to the degree for both active and passive random walks.
Furthermore, the mean recurrence time does or does not depend on the
distribution of interevent-times for the active and passive random walks,
respectively.

figure of merit was originally introduced in the SR community by Kim. The
brightness defined in this way is always positive and, in the geometrical
optics limit, can be interpreted as maximum density of photon flux in phase
space. For undulator and bending magnet radiation from a single electron, the
WD function can be explicitly calculated. In the case of an electron beam with
a finite emittance the brightness is given by the maximum of the convolution of
a single electron WD function and the probability distribution of the electrons
in phase space. In the particular case when both electron beam size and
electron beam divergence dominate over the diffraction size and the diffraction
angle, one can use a geometrical optics approach. However, there are
intermediate regimes when only the electron beam size or the electron beam
divergence dominate. In this asymptotic cases the geometrical optics approach
is still applicable, and the brightness definition used here yields back once
more the maximum photon flux density in phase space. In these intermediate
regimes we find a significant numerical disagreement between exact calculations
and the approximation for undulator brightness currently used in literature. We
extend the WD formalism to a satisfactory theory for the brightness of a

then prove that with large probability, the Frobenious norm of the estimation
rate can be of order $O(\sqrt{s(\log{r})/n})$ under a mild case, where $s$ and
$r$ denote the number of sparse entries and the rank of the population

alternating direction method of multipliers with global convergence is proposed
to tackle this problem, and meantime merits of the approach are also
illustrated by practicing numerical simulations.

attracted a lot of attention because it is a 2D semiconductor with a direct
band-gap. Due to low doping levels it is intrinsic and shows ambipolar
transport. This opens up the possibility to realize devices with the Fermi
level located in valence band, where the spin/valley coupling is strong and
leads to new and interesting physics. As a consequence of its intrinsically low
doping, large Schottky barriers form between WSe2 and metal contacts, which
impede the injection of charges at low temperatures. Here, we report on the
study of single-layer WSe2 transistors with a polymer electrolyte gate
(PEO:LiClO4). Polymer electrolytes allow the charge carrier densities to be
modulated to very high values, allowing the observation of both the electron-
and the hole-doped regimes. Moreover, our ohmic contacts formed at low
temperatures allow us to study the temperature dependence of electron and hole
mobilities. At high electron densities, a re-entrant insulating regime is also
observed, a feature which is absent at high hole densities.

Specifically, only approximate bandstructures can be computed for random alloys

the mathematical analogy between tight-binding and valence-force-field

However, there are some differences in the physics of the two problems
requiring modifications to the electronic structure approach. We therefore
derive a phonon alloy bandstructure (vibrational mode) approach based on our

capability for simultaneous observations at multiple frequencies, up to 129
GHz. The innovative multi-channel receivers present significant benefits for
astrometric measurements in the frequency domain. The aim of this work is to
verify the astrometric performance of the KVN using a comparative study with
the VLBA, a well established instrument. For that purpose, we carried out
nearly contemporaneous observations with the KVN and the VLBA, at 14/7 mm, in
April 2013. The KVN observations consisted of simultaneous dual frequency
observations, while the VLBA used fast frequency switching observations. We
used the Source Frequency Phase Referencing technique for the observational and
analysis strategy. We find that having simultaneous observations results in a
superior performance for compensation of all atmospheric terms in the
observables, in addition to offering other significant benefits for astrometric
analysis. We have compared the KVN astrometry measurements to those from the
VLBA. We find that the structure blending effects introduce dominant systematic
astrometric shifts and these need to be taken into account. We have tested
multiple analytical routes to characterize the impact of the low resolution
effects for extended sources in the astrometric measurements. The results from
the analysis of KVN and full VLBA datasets agree within 2-$\sigma$ of the
thermal error estimate. We interpret the discrepancy as arising from the
different resolutions. We find that the KVN provides astrometric results with
excellent agreement, within 1-$\sigma$, when compared to a VLBA configuration
which has a similar resolution. Therefore this comparative study verifies the
astrometric performance of KVN using SFPR at 14/7 mm, and validates the KVN as
an astrometric instrument.

those close to the Galactic Center. The discoveries of a radio-bright magnetar

the additional isotropic three-body terms stabilize a variety of

environment and accordingly adapt their internal state. Depending on the
criticality index of the situation, the system should dynamically focus or
widen its analysis and reasoning scope. A naive -why have less when you can
have more- approach would consist in systematically sampling the context at a
very high rate and triggering the reasoning process regularly. This reasoning
process would then need to mine a huge amount of data, extract a relevant view,
and finally analyze this adequate view. This overall process would require some
heavy resources and/or be time-consuming, conflicting with the (near) real-time
response time requirements of intelligent systems. We claim that a continuous
and more flexible navigation into context models, in space and in time, can
significantly improve reasoning processes. This paper thus introduces a novel
modeling approach together with a navigation concept, which consider time and
locality as first-class properties crosscutting any model element, and enable
the seamless navigation of models in this space-time continuum. In particular,
we leverage a time-relative navigation (inspired by the space-time and
distortion theory [7]) able to efficiently empower continuous reasoning
processes. We integrate our approach into an open-source modeling framework and
evaluate it on a smart grid reasoning engine for electric load prediction. We
demonstrate that reasoners leveraging this distorted space-time continuum
outperform the full sampling approach, and is compatible with most of (near)
real-time requirements.

It would also impact our efforts to establish the absolute neutrino mass scale

current experimental programs to search for neutrinoless double beta decay are
facing with the technical and financial challenge of increasing the
experimental mass while maintaining incredibly low levels of spurious
background. The new concept described in this paper could be the answer which
combines all the features of an ideal experiment: energy resolution, low cost
mass scalability, isotope choice flexibility and many powerful handles to make
the background negligible. The proposed technology is based on the use of
arrays of silicon detectors cooled to 120 K to optimize the collection of the

process. The probability of using a specific word in a sentence strongly
depends on the 'history' of word-usage earlier in that sentence. We study a
simple history-dependent model of text generation assuming that the
sample-space of word usage reduces along sentence formation, on average. We
first show that the model explains the approximate Zipf law found in word
frequencies as a direct consequence of sample-space reduction. We then
empirically quantify the amount of sample-space reduction in the sentences of
ten famous English books, by analysis of corresponding word-transition tables
that capture which words can follow any given word in a text. We find a highly
nested structure in these transition tables and show that this `nestedness' is
tightly related to the power law exponents of the observed word frequency
distributions. With the proposed model it is possible to understand that the
nestedness of a text can be the origin of the actual scaling exponent, and that
deviations from the exact Zipf law can be understood by variations of the
degree of nestedness on a book-by-book basis. On a theoretical level we are
able to show that in case of weak nesting, Zipf's law breaks down in a fast
transition. Unlike previous attempts to understand Zipf's law in language the
sample-space reducing model is not based on assumptions of multiplicative,
preferential, or self-organised critical mechanisms behind language formation,

us to determine the scale height with a 25% accuracy for samples of 38 clusters
or more. We apply our method to investigate the temporal evolution of cluster
scale height, using homogeneously selected sub-samples of Kharchenko et al.
(MWSC), Dias et al. (DAML02), WEBDA, and Froebrich et al. (FSR).
  We identify a linear relationship between scale height and log(age/yr) of
clusters, considerably different from field stars. The scale height increases
from about 40pc at 1Myr to 75pc at 1Gyr, most likely due to internal evolution
and external scattering events. After 1Gyr, there is a marked change of the
behaviour, with the scale height linearly increasing with log(age/yr) to about
550pc at 3.5Gyr. The most likely interpretation is that the surviving clusters
are only observable because they have been scattered away from the mid-plane in
their past. A detailed understanding of this observational evidence can only be
achieved with numerical simulations of the evolution of cluster samples in the
Galactic Disk.
  Furthermore, we find a weak trend of an age-independent increase in scale
height with galactocentric distance. There are no significant temporal or
spatial variations of the cluster distribution zero point. We determine the

approximate the optimal strategy of a trader willing to unwind a large
portfolio. The method we propose is very general as it can be applied to
multi-asset portfolios with any form of execution costs, including a bid-ask
spread component, even when participation constraints are imposed. Our method,
based on convex duality, only requires Hamiltonian functions to have $C^{1,1}$
regularity while classical methods require additional regularity and cannot be
applied to all cases found in practice.

introduce a notion of dimensionality of the free parameters defining the
action. General flow equations for the dimensionless bare coupling constants
can then be derived, in terms of a discretely varying cut-off, and in which all
the so-called melonic Feynman diagrams contribute. Linearizing around the
Gaussian fixed point allows to recover the splitting between relevant,
irrelevant, and marginal coupling constants. Pushing the perturbative expansion
to second order for the marginal parameters, we are able to determine their
behaviour in the vicinity of the Gaussian fixed point. Along the way, several
technical tools are reviewed, including a discussion of combinatorial factors
and of the Laplace approximation, which reduces the evaluation of the
amplitudes in the UV limit to that of Gaussian integrals.

inside the HII region Sh 2-129. The driving source, the nature, and the
distance of Ou4 are not known. Deep narrow-band imagery of the whole nebula at
arcsec resolution was obtained to study its morphology. Long-slit spectroscopy
of the tips of the bipolar lobes was secured to determine the gas ionization
mechanism, physical conditions, and line-of-sight velocities. An estimate of
the proper motions at the tip of the south lobe using archival images is
attempted. The existing multi-wavelength data for Sh 2-129 and HR 8119 are also
comprehensively reviewed. The morphology of Ou4, its emission-line spatial
distribution, line flux ratios, and the kinematic modelling adopting a
bow-shock parabolic geometry, illustrate the expansion of a shock-excited fast
collimated outflow. The radial velocities and reddening are consistent with
those of Sh 2-129 and HR 8119. The improved determination of the distance to
HR8119 (composed of two B0 V and one B0.5 V stars) and Sh 2-129 is 712 pc. We
identify in WISE images a 5 arcmin-radius (1 pc at the distance above) bubble
of emission at 22 micron emitted by hot (107 K) dust, located inside the
central part of Ou4 and corresponding to several [O III] features of Ou4. The
apparent position and the properties studied in this work are consistent with
the hypothesis that Ou4 is located inside the Sh 2-129 HII region, suggesting
that it was launched some 90 000 yrs ago by HR8119. The outflow total kinetic
energy is estimated to be ~4e47~ergs. However, the alternate possibility that
Ou4 is a bipolar planetary nebula, or the result of an eruptive event on a
massive AGB or post-AGB star not yet identified, cannot be ruled out.

cross-correlation of visibilities across time and show that the drift scan

than protons and their temperature is anisotropic. In-situ observations of fast
solar wind streams provide direct evidence for turbulent Alfv\'en wave
spectrum, left-hand polarized ion-cyclotron waves, and He$^{++}$ -- proton
drift in the solar wind plasma, which can produce temperature anisotropies by
resonant absorption and perpendicular heating of the ions. Furthermore, the
solar wind is expected to be inhomogeneous on decreasing scales approaching the
Sun. We study the heating of solar wind ions in inhomogeneous plasma with a
2.5D hybrid code. We include the expansion of the solar wind in an
inhomogeneous plasma background, combined with the effects of a turbulent wave
spectrum of Alfv\'enic fluctuations and initial ion-proton drifts. We study the
influence of these effects on the perpendicular ion heating and cooling and on
the spectrum of the magnetic fluctuations in the inhomogeneous background wind.
We find that inhomogeneities in the plasma lead to enhanced heating compared to
the homogenous solar wind, and the generation of significant power of oblique
waves in the solar wind plasma. The cooling effect due to the expansion is not
significant for super-Alfv\'enic drifts, and is diminished further when we
include an inhomogenous background density. We reproduce the ion temperature
anisotropy seen in observations and previous models, which is present
regardless of the perpendicular cooling due to solar wind expansion. We
conclude that small scale inhomogeneities in the inner heliosphere can
significantly affect resonant wave ion heating.

ways: the in and out states are not necessarily twisted and the number of twist
fields N can be bigger than 2.
  In order to quantize the theory we need to find the normal modes. Then we
need to define a product between two modes which is conserved. Because of this
we need to use the Klein-Gordon product and to separate the string coordinate
into the classical and the quantum part. The quantum part has different
boundary conditions than the original string coordinates but these boundary
conditions are precisely those which make the operator describing the equation
of motion self adjoint.
  The splitting of the string coordinates into a classical and quantum part
allows the formulation of an improved overlap principle. Using this approach we
then proceed in computing the generating function for the generic correlator

degeneracy problems that hinder the derivation of the age, mass, extinction,

broad-band photometry is used. While Paper I concentrated on deriving age,
mass, and extinction of star clusters for one fixed metallicity, we here derive
these parameters in case when metallicity is let free to vary. The results were
obtained using several different filter systems ($UBVRI$, $UBVRIJHK$,
GALEX+$UBVRI$), which allowed to optimally reduce the different degeneracies
between the cluster physical parameters. The age, mass, and extinction of a
sample of artificial star clusters were derived by comparing their broad-band
integrated magnitudes with the magnitudes of a large grid of cluster models
with various metallicities. A large collection of artificial clusters was
studied to model the different degeneracies in the age, mass, extinction, and
metallicity parameter space when stochasticity is taken into account in the
cluster models. We show that, without prior knowledge on the metallicity, the
optical bands ($UBVRI$) fail to allow a correct derivation of the age, mass,
and extinction because of the strong degeneracies between models of different
metallicities. Adding near-infrared information ($UBVRI$+$JHK$) slightly helps
in improving the parameter derivation, except for the metallicity. Adding
ultraviolet data (GALEX+$UBVRI$) helps significantly in deriving these
parameters and allows constraining the metallicity when the photometric errors
have a Gaussian distribution with standard deviations 0.05 mag for $UBVRI$ and
0.15 mag for the GALEX bands.

modes present at each location in the Sun and the associated growth rates. The
overall instability has unstable modes throughout the convection zone and also
slightly below it at middle and high latitudes. It contains three classes of
modes: large-scale hydrodynamic convective modes, large-scale hydrodynamic
shear modes, and small-scale magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) shear modes, which may
be properly called MRI modes. While large-scale convective modes are the most
rapidly growing modes in most of the convective zone, MRI modes are important
in both stably stratified and convectively unstable locations near the
tachocline at colatitudes theta less than 53 degrees. Nonaxisymmetric MRI modes
grow faster than the corresponding axisymmetric modes; for some poloidal
magnetic fields, the nonaxisymmetric MRI growth rates are similar to the
angular rotation frequency Omega, while axisymmetric modes are stabilized. We
briefly discuss the saturation of the field produced by MRI modes, finding that
the implied field at the base of the convective zone in the Sun is comparable
to that derived based on dynamos active in the tachocline and that the
saturation of field resulting from the MRI may be of importance even in the
upper convection zone.

that the absolute visual magnitudes of these stars are faint, with M_V~ -2.3 to
-3.1. We have performed a preliminary analysis with CMFGEN, and we find that
(despite the faint visual magnitudes) the bolometric luminosities of these

evolved, with significantly enriched N and He. Their effective temperatures are
also normal for early-type WNs. What is unusual about these stars is that they
have a surprisingly small mass-loss rate compared to other early-type WNs. How
these stars got to be the way they are (single star evolution? binary

of PAHs containing (5,7)-member ring defects, focusing on pyrene and coronene.
Using density functional theory, we investigate the effects of such defects on
the IR spectra of pyrene and coronene and their cations and anions. In
addition, we explore parts of the potential energy surface of the neutral
species and discuss alternative formation pathways. The addition of
(5,7)-membered ring defects in pyrene and coronene results in a change of the
IR spectra, both molecules lose their typical spectroscopic signature. We find
shifts in the positions of the band as well as different intensities and a rise
in the number of features. The boundaries in terms of the size of the PAHs
exhibiting a (5,7)-membered ring defect are studied and shown. Investigation of
the minimal energy pathway leads to a result of 8.21 eV for pyrene and 8.41 eV
for coronene as minimum activation barriers for the transformation from ground
state to defected state. Whereas pyrene retains some of its symmetry due to the
symmetry exhibited by the Stone-Wales defect itself, coronene loses much more
of its symmetry. The formation of these (5,7)-ring defects in PAHs may be well
supported in AGB stars or PNe. Those environments strongly enable the
transition from the ground state to the defect state. Therefore the knowledge

Based on the measured velocity function we statistically connect galaxies with
their host halo, via abundance matching. In a lambda cold dark matter
($\Lambda$CDM) cosmology, dwarf galaxies are expected to be hosted by halos
that are significantly more massive than indicated by the measured galactic
velocity; if smaller halos were allowed to host galaxies, then ALFALFA would
measure a much higher galactic number density. We then seek observational
verification of this predicted trend by analyzing the kinematics of a
literature sample of gas-rich dwarf galaxies. We find that galaxies with
$V_\mathrm{rot,HI} \lesssim 25$ $\mathrm{km} \, \mathrm{s}^{-1}$ are
kinematically incompatible with their predicted $\Lambda$CDM host halos, in the
sense that hosts are too massive to be accommodated within the measured
galactic rotation curves. This issue is analogous to the ""too big to fail""
problem faced by the bright satellites of the Milky Way, but here it concerns
extreme dwarf galaxies in the field. Consequently, solutions based on
satellite-specific processes are not applicable in this context. Our result
confirms the findings of previous studies based on optical survey data and
addresses a number of observational systematics present in these works.
Furthermore, we point out the assumptions and uncertainties that could strongly
affect our conclusions. We show that the two most important among them -namely
baryonic effects on the abundances of halos and on the rotation curves of
halos- do not seem capable of resolving the reported discrepancy.

  In this work, we propose a new general framework for feature construction.
The need for feature construction in a data set is indicated by class outliers
and discriminative pattern mining used to derive features on their
k-neighborhoods. We instantiate the framework with LOF and C4.5-Rules, and
evaluate the usefulness of the derived features on a diverse collection of UCI
data sets. The derived features are more often useful than ones derived by
DC-Fringe, and our approach is much less likely to overfit. But while a weak
learner, Naive Bayes, benefits strongly from the feature construction, the
effect is less pronounced for C4.5, and almost vanishes for an SVM leaner.

supernova (SN) impostor in NGC 5806, which began a multi-stage outburst in 2014
May. The initial '2014a' discovery brightening exhibited an absolute magnitude
of M~-12 and the spectral characteristics of a cool dense outflow, including
P-Cygni lines of Fe II, H I, Na I, and strong line blanketing from metals. The
source rapidly climbed and peaked near M~-15 mag after two additional weeks.
During this bright '2014b' phase the spectrum became dominated by Balmer
emission and a stronger blue continuum, similar to the SN impostor SN 1997bs.
Archival images from the Hubble Space Telescope between 1997 and 2005 reveal a
luminous (4e5 Lsun) variable precursor star. Its location on the
Hertzsprung-Russell diagram is consistent with a massive (M_init~30 Msun) cool
hypergiant having an extremely dense wind and an Eddington ratio just below
unity. At the onset of the recent 2014a brightening, however, the object became
super-Eddington. The subsequent boost in luminosity during the 2014b phase
probably resulted from circumstellar interaction. SN Hunt 248 provides the
first case of a cool hypergiant undergoing a giant eruption reminiscent of
outbursts from luminous blue variable (LBV) stars. This lends support to the
hypothesis that some cool hypergiants, such as Rho Cas, could be LBVs
masquerading under a pseudo-photosphere created by their extremely dense winds.
Moreover, SN Hunt 248 demonstrates that eruptions stemming from such stars can
rival in peak luminosity the giant outbursts of much more massive systems like
Eta Car.

the ambient solar wind on the CME's propagation. We found that two preceding
CMEs heading in different directions disturbed the overall shape of the CME and
influenced its propagation behavior. While the Venus-directed segment underwent
a gradual deceleration (from ~2700 km/s at 15 R_sun to ~1500 km/s at 154
R_sun), the Earth-directed part showed an abrupt retardation below 35 R_sun
(from ~1700 to ~900 km/s). After that, it was propagating with a quasi-constant
speed in the wake of a preceding event. Our results highlight the importance of
studies concerning the unequal evolution of CMEs. Forecasting can only be

hypothetical states is usually addressed under the assumption that one has
perfect knowledge of the possible states of the system. In this thesis, I
analyze the role of the prior information available in facing such problems,
and consider scenarios where the information regarding the possible states is
incomplete. In front of a complete ignorance of the possible states' identity,
I discuss a quantum ""programmable"" discrimination machine for qubit states that
accepts this information as input programs using a quantum encoding, rather
than as a classical description. The optimal performance of these machines is
studied for general qubit states when several copies are provided, in the
schemes of unambiguous, minimum-error, and error-margin discrimination. Then,
this type of automation in discrimination tasks is taken further. By realizing
a programmable machine as a device that is trained through quantum information
to perform a specific task, I propose a quantum ""learning"" machine for
classifying qubit states that does not require a quantum memory to store the
qubit programs and, nevertheless, performs as good as quantum mechanics
permits. Such learning machine thus allows for several optimal uses with no
need for retraining. A similar learning scheme is also discussed for coherent
states of light. I present it in the context of the readout of a classical
memory by means of classically correlated coherent signals, when these are
produced by an imperfect source. I show that, in this case, the retrieval of
information stored in the memory can be carried out more accurately when fully
general quantum measurements are used. Finally, as a transversal topic, I
propose an efficient algorithmic way of decomposing any quantum measurement
into convex combinations of simpler (extremal) measurements.

collapses on a spacelike hypersurface, and find that the spectrum of scalar
perturbations depends on the hypersurface. For reasonable choices, we can
recover the usual inflationary predictions for scalar perturbations in
minimally coupled single-field models. In models where non-minimal coupling to
gravity is important and the field value is sub-Planckian, we do not get a
nearly scale-invariant spectrum of scalar perturbations. As gravitational waves
are only produced at second order, the tensor-to-scalar ratio is negligible. We
conclude that detection of inflationary gravitational waves would indeed be

relations which are terminating from any initial state are exactly the
reduction relations whose transitive closure, restricted to the accessible
states, is included in some finite union of well-founded relations. An
alternative statement of the theorem is that terminating reduction relations
are precisely those having a ""disjunctively well-founded transition invariant"".
From this result the same authors and Byron Cook designed an algorithm checking
a sufficient condition for termination for a while-if program. The algorithm
looks for a disjunctively well-founded transition invariant, made of
well-founded relations of height omega, and if it finds it, it deduces the
termination for the while-if program using the Termination Theorem.
  This raises an interesting question: What is the status of reduction
relations having a disjunctively well-founded transition invariant where each
relation has height omega? An answer to this question can lead to a
characterization of the set of while-if programs which the termination
algorithm can prove to be terminating. The goal of this work is to prove that
they are exactly the set of reduction relations having height omega^n for some
n < omega. Besides, if all the relations in the transition invariant are
primitive recursive and the reduction relation is the graph of the restriction
to some primitive recursive set of a primitive recursive map, then a final
state is computable by some primitive recursive map in the initial state.
  As a corollary we derive that the set of functions, having at least one
implementation in Podelski Rybalchenko while-if language with a well-founded
disjunctively transition invariant where each relation has height omega, is
exactly the set of primitive recursive functions.

single antenna and transmits at fixed power, and propose a distributed price
update strategy for a pricing-based user association scheme, in which the users
are assigned to the BS based on the value of a utility function minus a price.
The proposed price update algorithm is based on a coordinate descent method for
solving the dual of the network utility maximization problem, and it has a
rigorous performance guarantee. The main advantage of the proposed algorithm as
compared to the existing subgradient method for price update is that the
proposed algorithm is independent of parameter choices and can be implemented
asynchronously. Further, this paper considers the joint user association and BS
power control problem, and proposes an iterative dual coordinate descent and
the power optimization algorithm that significantly outperforms existing
approaches. Finally, this paper considers the joint user association and BS
beamforming problem for the case where the BSs are equipped with multiple
antennas and spatially multiplex multiple users. We incorporate dual coordinate
descent with the weighted minimum mean-squared error (WMMSE) algorithm, and
show that it achieves nearly the same performance as a computationally more
complex benchmark algorithm (which applies the WMMSE algorithm on the entire
network for BS association), while avoiding excessive BS handover.

two-dimensional, bistable lattices via the method of exponential asymptotics.
Within a narrow region of parameter space, fronts connecting the two stable
states are pinned to the underlying lattice. Localised solutions are formed by
matching two such stationary fronts back-to-back; depending on the orientation
relative to the lattice, the solution branch may `snake' back and forth within
the pinning region via successive saddle-node bifurcations. Standard continuum
approximations in the weakly nonlinear limit (equivalently, the limit of small
mesh size) do not exhibit this behaviour, due to the resultant leading-order
reaction-diffusion equation lacking a periodic spatial structure. By including
exponentially small effects hidden beyond all algebraic orders in the
asymptotic expansion, we find that exponentially small but exponentially
growing terms are switched on via error function smoothing near Stokes lines.
Eliminating these otherwise unbounded beyond-all-orders terms selects the
origin (modulo the mesh size) of the front, and matching two fronts together
yields a set of equations describing the snaking bifurcation diagram. This is
possible only within an exponentially small region of parameter space---the
pinning region. Moreover, by considering fronts orientated at an arbitrary
angle $\psi$ to the $x$-axis, we show that the width of the pinning region is
non-zero only if $\tan\psi$ is rational or infinite. This is the first time a
formula explicitly relating the orientation of a front to the width of its

optimal transfer of quantum states through a set of $s$ harmonic oscillators
composing a network with connected ends as a closed quantum circuit. For this
purpose we start from a general quadratic Hamiltonian form. The relationship
between the parameters of the Hamiltonian, the network size, and the time
interval required for such transfer are explicitly shown. Particular physical
realizations of this Hamiltonian, transfer of entangled states, including
transfer of states at the expense of a quantum entanglement, are also
considered.

string field theory. The new star product is formulated in a half-phase-space,
and because phase space is independent of any background fields, the
interactions are background independent. In this basis there is a large amount
of symmetry, including a supersymmetry OSp(d|2) that acts on matter and ghost
degrees of freedom, and simplifies computations. The BRST operator that defines
the quadratic kinetic term of string field theory may be regarded as the
solution of the equation of motion A*A=0 of a purely cubic background
independent string field theory. We find an infinite number of non-perturbative
solutions to this equation, and are able to associate them to the BRST operator
of conformal field theories on the worldsheet. Thus, the background emerges
from a spontaneous-type breaking of a purely cubic highly symmetric theory. The
form of the BRST field breaks the symmetry in a tractable way such that the
symmetry continues to be useful in practical perturbative computations as an
expansion around some background. The new Moyal basis is called the $\sigma
$-basis, where $\sigma$ is the worldsheet parameter of an open string. A vital
part of the new star product is a natural and crucially needed mid-point
regulator in this continuous basis, so that all computations are finite. The
regulator is removed after renormalization and then the theory is finite only
in the critical dimension. Boundary conditions for D-branes at the endpoints of
the string are naturally introduced and made part of the theory as simple rules
in algebraic computations. A byproduct of our approach is an astonishing
suggestion of the formalism: the roots of ordinary quantum mechanics may
originate in the rules of non-commutative interactions in string theory.

estimators with negligible bias. Confidence interval coverage was generally in
excess of nominal levels (up to 99.8%) following fixed-effects multiple

characteristic temporal intervals which, by definition, are different from each
other: the draconitic, anomalistic and sidereal periods. They all coincide in
the Keplerian case. Such a degeneracy is removed, in general, when a
post-Keplerian acceleration is present. We analytically work out the
corrections to such otherwise Keplerian periods which are induced by general
relativity (Schwarzschild and Lense-Thirring) and, at the Newtonian level, by
the quadrupole of the primary. In many astronomical and astrophysical systems,
like exoplanets, one of the most accurately determined quantities is just the
time span characterizing the orbital revolution, which is often measured
independently with different techniques like the transit photometry and the
radial velocities. Thus, our results could be useful, in principle, to either
constrain the physical properties of the central body and/or perform new tests
of general relativity, especially when no other standard observables like,
e.g., the orbital precessions are accessible to observations. The difference of
two independently measured periods would cancel out the common Keplerian term
leaving just a post-Keplerian correction. Furthermore, by comparing the
theoretically predicted post-Keplerian expressions $T^{(\textrm{pK})}$ with the
experimental accuracy $\sigma_{T_\textrm{exp}}$ in measuring the orbital
period(s) it is possible to identify those systems whose observations should be
re-processed with genuine post-Keplerian models if
$T^{(\textrm{pK})}>\sigma_{T_\textrm{exp}}$. It seems just the case for WASP-33
b since $\sigma_{T_\textrm{exp}}=0.04$ s, while $3$ s$\leq
T_\textrm{dra}^{(J_2)}\leq 9.5$ s, $T_\textrm{dra}^{(\textrm{GE)}}=0.36$ s.

  particles in the gravitoelectric field of a non-rotating body","LaTex2e, 12 pages, no figures, no tables, 15 references",,,,"gr-qc astro-ph.EP physics.space-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  It is known that, in the weak-field and slow-motion approximation of general
relativity, the stationary component of the gravitational field of a rotating
body, proportional to its angular momentum, is able to discriminate between the
opposite directions of motion of a pair of counter-orbiting tests particles
moving along geometrically identical paths: it is the so-called gravitomagnetic
clock effect. In this paper, we show that, to the first post-Newtonian level,
there is also a gravitolectric clock effect induced by the static component of
the gravitational field of a non-rotating body. Indeed, the difference of the
draconitic periods of two test particles moving in opposite directions along
identical quasi-circular orbits turns out to be non-vanishing. It depends on
the shape, the size and the pericenter location of the orbit, but it is
independent of the initial position along it. On the contrary, the
gravitoelectric corrections to the anomalistic periods turn out to be the same
for both prograde and retrograde orbital motions. For a hypothetical pair of
Earth satellites in Supertundra-like orbits, the gravitoelectric draconitic
clock effect could be as large as 46 $\mu$s, while a Juno-like orbital
configuration around Jupiter would allow to reach about $0.01$ s.

of stationary three-dimensional (3-D) potential energy under general loadings
with a third-order error. Staring from the 3-D nonlinear elasticity (with both
geometrical and material nonlinearity) and by a series expansion, we deduce a
vector plate equation with three unknowns, which exhibits the local
force-balance structure. The success relies on using the 3-D field equations
and bottom traction condition to derive exact recursion relations for the
coefficients. Associated weak formulations are considered, leading to a 2-D
virtual work principle. An alternative approach based on a 2-D truncated energy
is also provided, which is less consistent than the first plate theory but has
the advantage of the existence of a 2-D energy function. As an example, we
consider the pure bending problem of a hyperelastic block. The comparison
between the analytical plate solution and available exact one shows that the
plate theory gives second-order correct results. Comparing with existing plate
theories, it appears that the present one has a number of advantages, including
the consistency, order of correctness, generality of the loadings,
applicability to finite-strain problems and no involvement of unphysical
quantities.

complex and RF-challenging environments, such as underground and underwater,
due to its advantage over EM wave-based techniques in penetrating lossy medium.
However, the transmission distance of MI techniques is limited since magnetic
field attenuates very fast in the near field. To this end, this paper proposes
Metamaterial-enhanced Magnetic Induction (M$^2$I) communication mechanism,
where a MI coil antenna is enclosed by a metamaterial shell that can enhance
the magnetic fields around the MI transceivers. As a result, the M$^2$I
communication system can achieve tens of meters communication range by using
pocket-sized antennas. In this paper, an analytical channel model is developed
to explore the fundamentals of the M$^2$I mechanism, in the aspects of
communication range and channel capacity, and the susceptibility to various
hostile and complex environments. The theoretical model is validated through
the finite element simulation software, Comsol Multiphysics. Proof-of-concept
experiments are also conducted to validate the feasibility of M$^2$I.

indicate that atoms (and planets) can only exist in three-dimensional space.
This is why observable space is solely 3-dimensional. Both a novel Virial
theorem analysis, and detailed classical and quantum energy calculations for
3-space circular and elliptical orbits indicate that they have no orbital
binding energy in greater than 3-space. The same energy equation also excludes
the possibility of atom-like bodies in strictly 1 and 2-dimensions. A
prediction is made that in the search for deviations from r^-2 of the
gravitational force at sub-millimeter distances such a deviation must occur at
< ~ 10^-10 m (or < ~10^-12 m considering muoniom), since atoms would
disintegrate if the curled up dimensions of string theory were larger than
this. Callender asserts that the often-repeated claim in previous work that
stable orbits are possible in only three dimensions is not even remotely
established. The binding energy analysis herein avoids the pitfalls that
Callender points out, as it circumvents stability issues. An uncanny quantum
surprise is present in very high dimensions.
