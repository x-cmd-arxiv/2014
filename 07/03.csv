technology leave a lot of work done in current technology will make the
acceptability difficult. One side familiarly with new technology and other side
transformation of old circuit designs to new technology will pose a challenge
to designers. A need for convertibility of irreversible circuit to reversible

insulator--normal metal--ferromagnetic insulator system. Long-range dynamic
coupling because of spin pumping and spin transfer lead to collective magnetic
excitations in the two thin-film ferromagnets. In addition, the dynamic dipolar
field contributes to the interlayer coupling. By solving the
Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert-Slonczewski equation for macrospin excitations and the
exchange-dipole volume as well as surface spin waves, we compute the effect of
the dynamic coupling on the resonance frequencies and linewidths of the various
modes. The long-wavelength modes may couple acoustically or optically. In the
absence of spin-memory loss in the normal metal, the spin-pumping-induced
Gilbert damping enhancement of the acoustic mode vanishes, whereas the optical
mode acquires a significant Gilbert damping enhancement, comparable to that of
a system attached to a perfect spin sink. The dynamic coupling is reduced for
short-wavelength spin waves, and there is no synchronization. For intermediate
wavelengths, the coupling can be increased by the dipolar field such that the
modes in the two ferromagnetic insulators can couple despite possible small
frequency asymmetries. The surface waves induced by an easy-axis surface
anisotropy exhibit much greater Gilbert damping enhancement. These modes also
may acoustically or optically couple, but they are unaffected by thickness
asymmetries.

compares with the currently best known solutions, which are for the

game} in the scenario in which the $n$ players sit on a given arbitrary
\emph{host graph}, which constrains the set of edges a player can activate at a
cost of $\alpha \geq 0$ each. This finds its motivations in the physical
limitations one can have in constructing links in practice, and it has been
studied in the past only when the routing cost component of a player is given
by the sum of distances to all the other nodes. Here, we focus on another
popular routing cost, namely that which takes into account for each player its
\emph{maximum} distance to any other player. For this version of the game, we
first analyze some of its computational and dynamic aspects, and then we
address the problem of understanding the structure of associated pure Nash
equilibria. In this respect, we show that the corresponding price of anarchy
(PoA) is fairly bad, even for several basic classes of host graphs. More
precisely, we first exhibit a lower bound of $\Omega (\sqrt{ n / (1+\alpha)})$
for any $\alpha = o(n)$. Notice that this implies a counter-intuitive lower
bound of $\Omega(\sqrt{n})$ for very small values of $\alpha$ (i.e., edges can
be activated almost for free). Then, we show that when the host graph is
restricted to be either $k$-regular (for any constant $k \geq 3$), or a
2-dimensional grid, the PoA is still $\Omega(1+\min\{\alpha,
\frac{n}{\alpha}\})$, which is proven to be tight for
$\alpha=\Omega(\sqrt{n})$. On the positive side, if $\alpha \geq n$, we show
the PoA is $O(1)$. Finally, in the case in which the host graph is very sparse
(i.e., $|E(H)|=n-1+k$, with $k=O(1)$), we prove that the PoA is $O(1)$, for any

noise properties of the visual system based primarily on its adaptation to the
statistics of the natural environment and the statistics of the visual stimuli
used in most VSTM experiments. We call this 'model mismatch'. Surprisingly, we
show that model mismatch alone, without assuming a general resource or capacity
limitation, can, in principle, account for some of the main qualitative
characteristics of performance limitations observed in VSTM tasks, including:
(i) monotonic decline in memory precision with increasing set size; (ii)
variability in memory precision across items and trials; and (iii) different
set-size dependencies for initial encoding rate and asymptotic precision when
the duration of image presentation is varied. We also investigate the
consequences of using experimental stimuli that more closely match the prior
expectations and/or internal noise properties of the visual system. The results
reveal qualitatively very different patterns of behavior for such stimuli,
suggesting that researchers should be cautious about generalizing the results
of experiments using ecologically unrealistic stimulus statistics to
ecologically more realistic stimuli.

violates the particle number conservation and completely erases quantumness

restore the symmetry by using the projected BCS theory and the exact numerical

excellently when transmitting over the noise channels. We examine the

quantum information of the states directly transmitted through the noise

a fundamental description of energy flow in materials, as well as for many
technological applications including thermal management in nanoelectronics,
thermoelectric devices, nano-enhanced photovoltaics and nanoparticle-mediated
thermal therapies. Thermal transport at the nanoscale is fundamentally
different from that at the macroscale and is determined by the distribution of
carrier mean free paths in a material, the length scales of the heat sources,
and the distance over which heat is transported. Past work has shown that
Fourier's law for heat conduction dramatically over-predicts the rate of heat
dissipation from heat sources with dimensions smaller than the mean free path
of the dominant heat-carrying phonons. In this work, we uncover a new regime of
nanoscale thermal transport that dominates when the separation between
nanoscale heat sources is small compared with the dominant phonon mean free
paths. Surprisingly, the interplay between neighboring heat sources can
facilitate efficient, diffusive-like heat dissipation, even from the smallest
nanoscale heat sources. This finding suggests that thermal management in
nanoscale systems including integrated circuits might not be as challenging as
projected. Finally, we demonstrate a unique and new capability to extract mean
free path distributions of phonons in materials, allowing the first
experimental validation of differential conductivity predictions from
first-principles calculations.

for the Higgs and $s$ condensates are given by inflationary fluctuations, and
we follow their dissipation and relaxation to the low energy vacua. We find
that both the lowest order perturbative and the non-perturbative decays are
blocked by thermal effects and large background fields and that the condensates
decay by two-loop thermal effects. Assuming instant reheating at $T=10^{16}$
GeV, the characteristic temperature for the Higgs condensate thermalization is
found to be $T_h \sim 10^{14}$ GeV, whereas $s$ thermalizes typically around
$T_s \sim 10^{6}$ GeV. By that time, the amplitude of the singlet is driven
very close to the vacuum value by the expansion of the universe, unless the
portal coupling takes a value $\lambda_{sh}\lesssim 10^{-7}$ and the singlet
$s$ never thermalizes. With these values of the coupling, it is possible to
slowly produce a sizeable fraction of the observed dark matter abundance via
singlet condensate fragmentation and thermal Higgs scattering. Physics also
below the electroweak scale can therefore be affected by the non-vacuum initial

response to sperm competition, yet the benefit of this form of collective
movement remains unclear. Here we use fine-scale imaging and a minimal
mathematical model to study sperm aggregation in the rodent genus $Peromyscus$.
We demonstrate that as the number of sperm cells in an aggregate increase, the
group moves with more persistent linearity but without increasing speed; this
benefit, however, is offset in larger aggregates as the geometry of the group
forces sperm to swim against one another. The result is a non-monotonic
relationship between aggregate size and average velocity with both a
theoretically predicted and empirically observed optimum of 6-7
sperm/aggregate. To understand the role of sexual selection in driving these
sperm group dynamics, we compared two sister-species with divergent mating
systems and find that sperm of $P.\,maniculatus$ (highly promiscuous), which
have evolved under intense competition, form optimal-sized aggregates more
often than sperm of $P.\,polionotus$ (strictly monogamous), which lack
competition. Our combined mathematical and experimental study of coordinated
sperm movement reveals the importance of geometry, motion and group size on
sperm velocity and suggests how these physical variables interact with
evolutionary selective pressures to regulate cooperation in competitive
environments.

volumetric image using a single x-ray projection. To fully extract motion
information hidden in projection images, we partitioned a projection image into
small patches. We utilized a sparse learning method to automatically select
patches that have a high correlation with principal component analysis (PCA)
coefficients of a lung motion model. A model that maps the patch intensity to
the PCA coefficients is built along with the patch selection process. Based on
this model, a measured projection can be used to predict the PCA coefficients,
which are further used to generate a motion vector field and hence a volumetric
image. We have also proposed an intensity baseline correction method based on
the partitioned projection, where the first and the second moments of pixel
intensities at a patch in a simulated image are matched with those in a
measured image via a linear transformation. The proposed method has been valid
in simulated data and real phantom data. The algorithm is able to identify
patches that contain relevant motion information, e.g. diaphragm region. It is
found that intensity correction step is important to remove the systematic
error in the motion prediction. For the simulation case, the sparse learning
model reduced prediction error for the first PCA coefficient to 5%, compared to
the 10% error when sparse learning is not used. 95th percentile error for the
predicted motion vector is reduced from 2.40 mm to 0.92mm. In the phantom case,
the predicted tumor motion trajectory is successfully reconstructed with 0.82
mm mean vector field error compared to 1.66 mm error without using the sparse
learning method. The algorithm robustness with respect to sparse level, patch
size, and existence of diaphragm, as well as computation time, has also been

hole accretion rate (BHAR) across a suite of different AGN feedback models,
using the time evolution of a merger simulation. By considering three different
stages of evolution, and a distinction between the nuclear and outer regions of
star formation, we consider 63 different cases. Despite many of the feedback
models fitting the M-\sigma\ relationship well, there are often distinct
differences in the SFR-BHAR correlations, with close to linear trends only
being present after the merger. Some of the models also show evolution in the
SFR-BHAR parameter space that is at times directly across the long-term
averaged SFR-BHAR correlation. This suggests that the observational SFR-BHAR
correlation found for ensembles of galaxies is an approximate statistical
trend, as suggested by Hickox et al. Decomposing the SFR into nuclear and outer
components also highlights notable differences between models and there is only
modest agreement with observational studies examining this in Seyfert galaxies.
For the fraction of the black hole mass growth from the merger event relative
to the final black hole mass, we find as much as a factor of three variation
among models. This also translates into a similar variation in the
post-starburst black hole mass growth. Overall, we find that while qualitative
features are often similar amongst models, precise quantitative analysis shows
there can be quite distinct differences.

breaking. In addition, we find that the luminescence handedness can be
controlled with magnetic field, to a degree that depends on the back-gate
voltage. An applied magnetic field therefore provides effective strategies for
control over the valley degree of freedom.

nonperturbative effects of disorder, which is detrimental to the topological
phase (eventually suppressing the superconducting gap completely), and the
effects of the tunneling barriers (or the transparency at the tunneling NS
contacts), which affect (and suppress) the zero bias conductance peak
associated with the zero energy Majorana bound states. We show that in the
presence of generic disorder and barrier transparency the interpretation of the
zero bias peak as being associated with the Majorana bound state is problematic
since the nonlocal correlations between the two NS contacts at two ends may not
manifest themselves in the tunneling conductance through the whole NSN
structure. We establish that a simple modification of the standard transport
measurements using conductance differences (rather than the conductance itself
as in a single NS junction) as the measured quantity can allow direct
observation of the nonlocal correlations inherent in the Majorana bound states

  Partitioning","Master Thesis",,,,"cs.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this thesis, Minimal Partitioning (MP) algorithm, an innovative algorithm
for enumerating all the spanning trees in an undirected graph is presented.
  While MP algorithm uses a computational tree graph to traverse all possible
spanning trees by the edge exchange technique, it has two unique properties
compared to previous algorithms. In the first place, the algorithm maintains a
state of minimal partition size in the spanning tree due to edge deletion. This
is realized by swapping peripheral edges, more precisely leaf edges, in most of
edge exchange operations. Consequently, the main structure of the spanning
trees is preserved during the steps of the enumeration process. This extra
constraint proves to be advantageous in many applications where the partition
size is a factor in the solution cost. Secondly, we introduce, and utilize, the
new concept of edge promotion: the exchanged edges always share one end.
Practically, and as a result of this property, the interface between the two
partitions of the spanning tree during edge exchange has to be maintained from
one side only.
  For a graph $G(V,E)$, MP algorithm requires $O(log V+E/V)$ expected time and
$OV log V)$ worst case time for generating each spanning tree. MP algorithm
requires a total expected space limit of $O(E log V)$ with worst case limit of
$O(EV)$. Like all edge exchange algorithms, MP algorithm retains the advantage
of compacted output of $O(1)$ per spanning tree by listing the relative
differences only.
  Three sample real-world applications of spanning trees enumeration are
explored and the effects of using MP algorithm are studied. Namely:
construction of nets of polyhedra, multi-robots spanning tree routing, and
computing the electric current in edges of a network. We report that MP
algorithm outperforms other algorithm by $O(V)$ time complexity.

evidence that AGN or bulges contribute to the suppression of star formation.

usefulness as a tool for understanding galaxies that do not always follow

Cet (HIP 5364, HD 6805) based on 118 high-precision optical radial velocities
taken at Lick Observatory since July 2000. Since October 2011 an additional
nine near-infrared Doppler measurements have been taken using the ESO CRIRES
spectrograph (VLT, UT1). The visible data set shows two clear periodicities.
Although we cannot completely rule out that the shorter period is due to
rotational modulation of stellar features, the infrared data show the same
variations as in the optical, which strongly supports that the variations are
caused by two planets. Assuming the mass of $\eta$ Cet to be 1.7 $M_\odot$, the
best edge-on coplanar dynamical fit to the data is consistent with two massive
planets ($m_b\sin i$ = 2.6 $\pm$ 0.2 $M_{\mathrm{Jup}}$, $m_c\sin i$ = 3.3
$\pm$ 0.2 $M_{\mathrm{Jup}}$), with periods of $P_b$ = 407 $\pm$ 3 days and
$P_c$ = 740 $\pm$ 5 days and eccentricities of $e_b$ = 0.12 $\pm$ 0.05 and
$e_c$ = 0.08 $\pm$ 0.03. We tested a wide variety of edge-on coplanar and
inclined planetary configurations for stability, which agree with the derived
radial velocities. We find that in certain coplanar orbital configurations with
moderate $e_b$ eccentricity, the planets can be effectively trapped in an
anti-aligned 2:1 mean motion resonance. A much larger non-resonant stable
region exists in low-eccentricity parameter space, although it appears to be
much farther from the best fit than the 2:1 resonant region. In all other
cases, the system is categorized as unstable or chaotic. Another conclusion
from the coplanar inclined dynamical test is that the planets can be at most a
factor of $\sim$ 1.4 more massive than their suggested minimum masses. This
stability constraint on the inclination excludes the possibility of two brown
dwarfs, and strongly favors a planetary system.

spectral synthesis, in this work we employ an alternative method based on
spectral indices to determine the atmospheric parameters of a sample of nearby
FGK dwarfs and subgiants observed by the MARVELS survey at moderate resolving
power (R~12,000). We have developed three codes to automatically normalize the
observed spectra, measure the equivalent widths of the indices and, through the
comparison of those with values calculated with pre-determined calibrations,
derive the atmospheric parameters of the stars. The calibrations were built
using a sample of 309 stars with precise stellar parameters obtained from the
analysis of high-resolution FEROS spectra. A validation test of the method was
conducted with a sample of 30 MARVELS targets that also have reliable
atmospheric parameters from high-resolution spectroscopic analysis. Our
approach was able to recover the parameters within 80 K for Teff, 0.05 dex for
[Fe/H] and 0.15 dex for log g, values that are lower or equal to the typical
external uncertainties found between different high-resolution analyzes. An
additional test was performed with a subsample of 138 stars from the ELODIE

that the spectral indices are a competitive tool to characterize stars with the

hydrated materials where it is thought to occur via the famous Grotthuss
mechanism through pathways formed by structural water. Using first-principles
density-functional theory calculations, we demonstrate that proton diffusion in
tungsten oxide dihydrate (WO$_{3}$.2H$_{2}$O), a known good proton conductor,
takes place within the layers of corner-sharing WO$_{6}$ octahedra without
direct involvement of structural water. The calculated proton migration barrier
in WO$_{3}$.2H$_{2}$O (0.42 eV) is in good agreement with the experimental
value inferred from the temperature dependence of conductivity (0.36 eV). The
preferred proton diffusion path in WO$_{3}$.2H$_{2}$O is essentially the same
as in $\gamma$-WO$_{3}$, and we find an activation energy of 0.35 eV for the
latter, which agrees well with the experimental values. In contrast to the
small intercalation voltages calculated for WO$_{3}$ and WO$_{3}$.2H$_{2}$O, we
find that proton absorption in the monohydrate WO$_{3}$.H$_{2}$O is
energetically highly favorable, corresponding to voltages in excess of 1 eV in
the dilute limit. However, strong proton-proton repulsion limits the
equilibrium H content at zero voltage. We find a fast one-dimensional diffusion
channel in WO$_{3}$.H$_{2}$O with an activation energy of only 0.07 eV at
dilute proton concentrations, but much higher barriers are expected at
near-equilibrium concentrations due to strong repulsive interactions with other
protons. Our results illustrate that low proton diffusion barriers and low
insertion voltages both contribute to fast proton transport in bulk
WO$_{3}$.2H$_{2}$O and $\gamma$-WO$_{3}$.

The differences can be explained through wavelength selection, depth of the

attributed to the temperature of the spectral energy distributions, as
shorter-wavelength maps select a hotter population of galaxies. Using the same
parent distribution and taking into account lensing bias we can also reproduce
the redshift distribution of 1.4 mm-selected ultra-bright galaxies, which peaks

spin configurations inside BiFeO3, we are able to show that a metallic
ferromagnetism is induced near the interface. We further develop an interface
exchange-coupling model and place the extracted exchange coupling interaction
strengths, from the first-principles calculations, into a resultant generic
phase diagram. Our conclusion of interfacial ferromagnetism is confirmed by the
presence of a hysteresis loop in field-dependent magnetization data. The
emergence of interfacial ferromagnetism should have implications to electronic

supersaturation have demonstrated a substantial nucleation barrier on the basal
surface at these temperatures, from which a molecular step energy can be
extracted using classical nucleation theory. Additional ice growth measurements
from liquid water as a function of supercooling exhibit a similar nucleation
barrier on the basal surface, yielding about the same molecular step energy.
These data suggest that ice growth from water vapor and from liquid water are
both well described by essentially the same underlying nucleation phenomenon

inspired by the recent success in moving micro particles using light and the
development of a tractor beam concept. For fluid surfaces, however, the only
known paradigm is the Stokes drift model, where linear planar waves push
particles in the direction of the wave propagation. Here we show how to fetch a
macroscopic floater from a large distance by sending a surface wave towards it.
We develop a new method of remote manipulation of floaters by forming inward
and outward surface jets, stationary vortices, and other complex surface flows
using nonlinear waves generated by a vertically oscillating plunger. The flows
can be engineered by changing the geometry and the power of a wave maker, and
the flow dissipation. The new method is robust and works both for long gravity
and for short capillary waves. We use a novel method of visualising 3D particle
trajectories on the surface. This letter introduces a new conceptual framework
for understanding wave-driven flows. The results form the basis for remote
manipulation of objects on the fluid surfaces and will help better
understanding motion of floaters on the ocean surface and the generation of
wave-driven jets.

We show that the introduction of Co $3d$ states in FeSe relaxes the bond

turn modifies the magnetic order which can be related to the spin state. Using
resonant inelastic X-ray spectroscopy we estimate the spin state of the system;
FeSe is found to be in a high spin state (S=2), but Fe is reduced to a low spin
state upon Co substitution of $x \le 0.25$, well below the structural
transition. Finally, we show evidence that FeSe is a moderately correlated
system but the introduction of Co into the host lattice weakens the correlation
strength for $x\ge0.25$. These novel findings are important to unravel the
mechanisms responsible for the superconducting state in iron-chalcogenide
superconductors.

is a composition of a proper closed function $P$ and a surjective linear map
$\cal M$, with the proximal mappings of $\tau P$, $\tau > 0$, simple to

applications in engineering and machine learning. In this paper, we examined
two types of splitting methods for solving this nonconvex optimization problem:
alternating direction method of multipliers and proximal gradient algorithm.
For the direct adaptation of the alternating direction method of multipliers,
we show that, if the penalty parameter is chosen sufficiently large and the
sequence generated has a cluster point, then it gives a stationary point of the
nonconvex problem. We also establish convergence of the whole sequence under an
additional assumption that the functions $h$ and $P$ are semi-algebraic.
Furthermore, we give simple sufficient conditions to guarantee boundedness of
the sequence generated. These conditions can be satisfied for a wide range of
applications including the least squares problem with the $\ell_{1/2}$
regularization. Finally, when $\cal M$ is the identity so that the proximal
gradient algorithm can be efficiently applied, we show that any cluster point
is stationary under a slightly more flexible constant step-size rule than what
is known in the literature for a nonconvex $h$.

on Herschel ability to resolve the Serpens South filaments. Some molecular

As soon as the sensors which are deployed in random fashion receives three
beacon messages (known locations broadcasted by anchors), they computes their
locations automatically by using our proposed algorithm. One of our significant
contributions is, we use only three different beacon messages to localize one
sensor, while in the best of our knowledge, all previously proposed methods use
at least four different known locations. The ability of our method to localize
by using only three known locations not only saves computation, time, energy,
but also reduces the number of anchors needed to be deployed and more
importantly reduces the communication overheads. Experimental results
demonstrate that our proposed scheme improves the overall efficiency of

authors introduced a simple procedure that allows one to detect whether and
explain why internal information arising in several novel coupled physics
(hybrid) imaging modalities could turn extremely unstable techniques, such as
optical tomography or electrical impedance tomography, into stable,
good-resolution procedures. It was shown that in all cases of interest, the
Frechet derivative of the forward mapping is a pseudo-differential operator
with an explicitly computable principal symbol. If one can set up the imaging
procedure in such a way that the symbol is elliptic, this would indicate that
the problem was stabilized. In the cases when the symbol is not elliptic, the
technique suggests how to change the procedure (e.g., by adding extra
measurements) to achieve ellipticity.
  In this article, we consider the situation arising in acousto-optical
tomography (also called ultrasound modulated optical tomography), where the
internal data available involves the Green's function, and thus depends
globally on the unknown parameter(s) of the equation and its solution. It is
shown that the technique of ""Stabilizing Inverse Problems by Internal Data"" can
be successfully adopted to this situation as well. We also obtain results on
generic uniqueness for the linearized problem in a variety of situations,
including those arising in acousto-electric and quantitative photoacoustic
tomography.

It is widely known that symplectic toric manifolds are encoded by Delzant
polytopes, and the cohomology and equivariant cohomology rings of a symplectic
toric manifold can be described in terms of the corresponding polytope.
Recently, Holm and Pires described the cohomology of a toric origami manifold
$M$ in terms of the orbit space $M/T$ when $M$ is orientable and the orbit
space $M/T$ is contractible. But in general the orbit space of a toric origami
manifold need not be contractible. In this paper we study the topology of
orientable toric origami manifolds for the wider class of examples: we require
that every proper face of the orbit space is acyclic, while the orbit space
itself may be arbitrary. Furthermore, we give a general description of the
equivariant cohomology ring of torus manifolds with locally standard torus
actions in the case when proper faces of the orbit space are acyclic and the
free part of the action is a trivial torus bundle.

invariants of knots and 3-manifolds.
  In Chapter 2, for any knot $K$ in a closed, oriented 3-manifold $M$, we use
$SU(2)$ representation spaces and the Lagrangian field theory framework of
Wehrheim and Woodward to define a new homological knot invariant
$\mathcal{S}(K)$. We then use a result of Ivan Smith to show that when $K$ is a
(1,1) knot in $S^3$ (a set of knots which includes torus knots, for example),
the rank of $\mathcal{S}(K)\otimes \mathbb{C}$ agrees with the rank of knot
Floer homology, $\widehat{HFK}(K)\otimes \mathbb{C}$, and we conjecture that
this holds in general for any knot $K$.
  In Chapter 3, we prove a somewhat strange result, giving a purely topological
formula for the Jones polynomial of a 2-bridge knot $K\subset S^3$. First, for
any lens space $L(p,q)$, we combine the $d$-invariants from Heegaard Floer
homology with certain Atiyah-Patodi-Singer/Casson-Gordon $\rho$-invariants to
define a function $$I_{p,q}: \mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z} \to \mathbb{Z}$$
  Let $K = K(p,q)$ denote the 2-bridge knot in $S^3$ whose double-branched
cover is $L(p,q)$, let $\sigma(K)$ denote the knot signature, and let
$\mathcal{O}$ denote the set of relative orientations of $K$, which has
cardinality $2^{(\# \text{ of components of } K) - 1}$. Then we prove the
following formula for the Jones polynomial $J(K)$:
$$i^{-\sigma(K)}q^{3\sigma(K)}J(K)= \sum_{o\in\mathcal{O}}(iq)^{2\sigma(K^{o})}
+\left(q^{-1}-q^{1}\right)\sum_{\mathfrak{s}\in\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z}}(iq)^{I_{p,q}(\mathfrak{s})}$$

  In Chapter 4, we present joint work with Adam Levine, concerning Heegaard
Floer homology and the orderability of fundamental groups. Namely, we prove
that if $\widehat{CF}(M)$ is particularly simple, i.e., $M$ is what we call a
""strong $L$-space,"" then $\pi_1(M)$ is not left-orderable.

the secondary electron yield (SEY) of samples in the vacuum chamber of the
Cornell Electron Storage Ring (CESR) has been developed in connection with EC
studies for the CESR Test Accelerator program (CesrTA). The CesrTA in-situ
system, in operation since 2010, allows for SEY measurements as a function of
incident electron energy and angle on samples that are exposed to the
accelerator environment, typically 5.3 GeV counter-rotating beams of electrons
and positrons. The system was designed for periodic measurements to observe
beam conditioning of the SEY with discrimination between exposure to direct
photons from synchrotron radiation versus scattered photons and cloud
electrons. The SEY chambers can be isolated from the CESR beam pipe, allowing
us to exchange samples without venting the CESR vacuum chamber. Measurements so
far have been on metal surfaces and EC-mitigation coatings. The goal of the SEY
measurement program is to improve predictive models for EC build-up and
EC-induced beam effects. This report describes the CesrTA in-situ SEY

is directly proportional to the square of plasma density, its volume and the

that plasma density and temperature decide the threshold for saturation in

Our study takes the perspective of users who are the targets of display ads
shown on web sites. We develop a scalable crawling capability that enables us
to gather the details of display ads including creatives and landing pages. Our
crawling strategy is focused on maximizing the number of unique ads harvested.
Of critical importance to our study is the recognition that a user's profile
(i.e. browser profile and cookies) can have a significant impact on which ads
are shown. We deploy our crawler over a variety of websites and profiles and
this yields over 175K distinct display ads.
  We find that while targeting is widely used, there remain many instances in
which delivered ads do not depend on user profile; further, ads vary more over
user profiles than over websites. We also assess the population of advertisers
seen and identify over 3.7K distinct entities from a variety of business
segments. Finally, we find that when targeting is used, the specific types of
ads delivered generally correspond with the details of user profiles, and also
on users' patterns of visit.

  We start with a machine learning problem of predicting a user's preference

these signals persist even when (i) the most discriminative features are
removed and (ii) only relatively ""sparse"" users with fewer than 152 but more

(@ladygaga) enjoys more support from @TheDemocrats followers.

reflected in co-following and we demonstrate how our methodology can be used to
reveal the audience similarities between Apple and Puma and, less obviously,
between Nike and Coca-Cola. Concerning a user's popularity we find a
statistically significant connection between having a more ""average""

threatened people's privacy at the same time. As end users are becoming more
and more concerned on the protection of their private information, it is even
harder to track a specific user using conventional technologies. For example,
cookies might be cleared by users regularly. Apple has stopped apps accessing
UDIDs, and Android phones use some special permission to protect IMEI code. To
address this challenge, some recent studies have worked on tracing smart phones
using the hardware features resulted from the imperfect manufacturing process.
These works have demonstrated that different devices can be differentiated to
each other. However, it still has a long way to go in order to replace cookie
and be deployed in real world scenarios, especially in terms of properties like
uniqueness, robustness, etc. In this paper, we presented a novel method to
generate stable and unique device ID stealthy for smartphones by exploiting the
frequency response of the speaker. With carefully selected audio frequencies
and special sound wave patterns, we can reduce the impacts of non-linear
effects and noises, and keep our feature extraction process un-noticeable to
users. The extracted feature is not only very stable for a given smart phone
speaker, but also unique to that phone. The feature contains rich information
that is equivalent to around 40 bits of entropy, which is enough to identify
billions of different smart phones of the same model. We have built a prototype
to evaluate our method, and the results show that the generated device ID can
be used as a replacement of cookie.

the polarization distribution of the incident light. Unlikely the previously

spin-dependent splitting in the geometric PSHE is purely geometrically depend
upon the polarization distribution of light which can be tailored by assembling
its circular polarization basis with suitably magnitude and phase. This
metapolarization idea enables us to manipulate the geometric PSHE by suitably
tailoring the polarization geometry of light. Our scheme provides great
flexibility in the design of various polarization geometry and

numerically by solving the linear stability problem in a systematic way. A

modeling and molecular dynamic simulations that use mesoscale descriptions. Our
approach is a coarse-grained model based on integral equation theory, which can
represent polymer chains at variable levels of chemical details. The model is
analytical and depends on molecular and thermodynamic parameters of the system
under study, as well as on the direct correlation function in the k --> 0
limit, c0. A numerical solution to the PRISM integral equations is used to
determine c0, by adjusting the value of the effective hard sphere diameter, d,
to agree with the predicted equation of state. This single quantity
parameterizes the coarse-grained potential, which is used to perform mesoscale
simulations that are directly compared with atomistic-level simulations of the
same system. We test our coarse-graining formalism by comparing structural
correlations, isothermal compressibility, equation of state, Helmholtz and
Gibbs free energies, and potential energy and entropy using both united atom
and coarse-grained descriptions. We find quantitative agreement between the
analytical formalism for the thermodynamic properties, and the results of
Molecular Dynamics simulations, independent of the chosen level of
representation. In the mesoscale description, the potential energy of the
soft-particle interaction becomes a free energy in the coarse-grained
coordinates which preserves the excess free energy from an ideal gas across all
levels of description. The structural consistency between the united-atom and
mesoscale descriptions means the relative entropy between descriptions has been
minimized without any variational optimization parameters. The approach is
general and applicable to any polymeric system in different thermodynamic
conditions.

Panchromatic Hubble Andromeda Treasury program that also provides stellar
parameters derived from the individual energy distributions, our analysis is
focused on the young stars in three star-forming regions, located at
galactocentric distances of about 5, 10, and 15 kpc, corresponding to the inner
spiral arms, the ring structure, and the outer arm, respectively. We apply the
two-point correlation function to our selected sample to investigate the
clustering behavior of these stars across different time- and length-scales. We
find that young stellar structure survives across the whole extent of M31
longer than 300 Myr. Stellar distribution in all regions appears to be
self-similar, with younger stars being systematically more strongly clustered
than the older, which are more dispersed. The observed clustering is
interpreted as being induced by turbulence, the driving source for which is
probably gravitational instabilities driven by the spiral arms, which are
stronger closer to the galactic centre.

from first principles. We find that using an accurate model for the
polarizations of the acoustic phonon modes is crucial to obtain correct
numerical results. The interactions between electrons and acoustic phonon
modes, the gauge field and deformation potential, are calculated at the DFT
level in the framework of linear response. The zero-momentum limit of acoustic
phonons is interpreted as a strain pattern, allowing the calculation of the
acoustic gauge field parameter in the GW approximation. The role of electronic
screening on the electron-phonon matrix elements is investigated. We then solve
the Boltzmann equation semi-analytically in graphene, including both acoustic
and optical phonon scattering. We show that, in the Bloch-Gr\""uneisen and
equipartition regimes, the electronic transport is mainly ruled by the
unscreened acoustic gauge field, while the contribution due to the deformation
potential is negligible and strongly screened. By comparing with experimental
data, we show that the contribution of acoustic phonons to resistivity is
doping- and substrate-independent. The DFT+GW approach underestimates this
contribution to resistivity by about 30 %. Above 270K, the calculated
resistivity underestimates the experimental one more severely, the
underestimation being larger at lower doping. We show that, beside remote
phonon scattering, a possible explanation for this disagreement is the
electron-electron interaction that strongly renormalizes the coupling to
intrinsic optical-phonon modes. Finally, after discussing the validity of the
Matthiessen rule in graphene, we derive simplified analytical solutions of the
Boltzmann equation to extract the coupling to acoustic phonons, related to the
strain-induced gauge field, directly from experimental data.

However, the decrease of fractional oscillation amplitude with rise time, which
provides a main observational support for the flame spreading model, have so
far been reported from only a few bursts. Moreover, the non-detection and
intermittent detections of rise oscillations from many bursts are not yet
understood considering the flame spreading scenario. Here, we report the
decreasing trend of fractional oscillation amplitude from an extensive analysis
of a large sample of Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer Proportional Counter Array
bursts from ten neutron star low-mass X-ray binaries. This trend is 99.99%
significant for the best case, which provides, to the best of our knowledge, by
far the strongest evidence of such trend. Moreover, it is important to note
that an opposite trend is not found from any of the bursts. The concave shape
of the fractional amplitude profiles for all the bursts suggests
latitude-dependent flame speeds, possibly due to the effects of the Coriolis
force. We also systematically study the roles of low fractional amplitude and
low count rate for non-detection and intermittent detections of rise
oscillations, and attempt to understand them within the flame spreading
scenario. Our results support a weak turbulent viscosity for flame spreading,
and imply that burst rise oscillations originate from an expanding hot spot,
thus making these oscillations a more reliable tool to constrain the neutron

nonspecific binding event. The overall enhancement of site-specific association
rate is directly proportional to the maximum possible sliding length (LA,
square root of (6Do/kr) where Do is the 1D-diffusion coefficient and kr is the
dissociation rate constant associated with the nonspecific DNA-protein complex)
associated with the 1D-diffusion of protein molecule along DNA. Upon
considering several possible mechanisms we find that the DNA binding proteins
can efficiently locate their cognate sites on DNA by switching across
fast-moving, slow-moving and reading states of their DNA binding domains in a
cyclic manner. Irrespective of the type of mechanism the overall rate
enhancement factor asymptotically approaches a limiting value which is directly
proportional to LA as the total length of DNA that contains the cognate site
increases. These results are consistent with the in vitro experimental

angular momentum and $S=5/2$, is often put forward as a prototypical
highly-frustrated classical Heisenberg pyrochlore antiferromagnet. By employing
{\it ab initio} density functional theory (DFT), we obtain an effective spin
Hamiltonian for this material. This Hamiltonian contains nearest-neighbor
antiferromagnetic Heisenberg, bi-quadratic and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya
interactions as dominant terms and we use Monte Carlo simulations to
investigate the nonzero temperature properties of this minimal model. We find
that upon decreasing temperature, the system passes through a Coulomb phase,
composed of short-range correlated coplanar states, before transforming into an
""all-in/all-out"" (AIAO) state via a very weakly first order transition at a
critical temperature $T_c\approx 22$ K, in good agreement with the experimental
value for a reasonable set of Coulomb interaction $U$ and Hund's coupling
$J_{\rm H}$ describing the material. Despite the transition being first order,
the AIAO order parameter evolves below $T_c$ with a power-law behavior
characterized by a pseudo ""critical exponent"" $\beta \approx 0.18$ in accord
with experiment. We comment on the origin of this unusual $\beta$ value.

the Kepler Space Mission. We performed an analysis of the published radial
velocity measurements for Kepler-78 in order to derive a refined measurement
for the planet mass. Kepler-78 is an active star and radial velocity variations
due to activity were removed using a Floating Chunk Offset (FCO) method where
an orbital solution was made to the data by allowing the velocity offsets of
individual nights to vary. We show that if we had no a priori knowledge of the
transit period the FCO method used as a periodogram would still have detected
Kepler-78b in the radial velocity data. It can thus be effective at finding
unknown short-period signals in the presence of significant activity noise.
Using the FCO method while keeping the ephemeris and orbital phase fixed to the
photometric values and using only data from nights where 6-10 measurements were
taken results in a K-amplitude of 1.34 +/- 0.25 m/s. a planet mass of 1.31 +/-
0.24 M_Earth, and a planet density of rho = 4.5 (-2.0/+2.2) g/cm^3. Allowing
the orbital phase to be a free parameter reproduces the transit phase to within
the uncertainty. The corresponding density implies that Kepler-78b may have a
structure that is deficient in iron and is thus more like the Moon. Although
the various approaches that were used to filter out the activity of Kepler 78
produce consistent radial velocity amplitudes to within the errors, these are
still too large to constrain the structure of this planet. The uncertainty in
the mass for Kepler-78b is large enough to encompass models with structures
ranging from Mercury-like (iron enriched) to Moon-like (iron deficient). A more
accurate K-amplitude as well as a better determination of the planet radius are
needed to distinguish between these models.

(EDFs) to multi-reference (MR) applications involve using the generalized Wick
theorem (GWT), which leads to singular energy kernels that cannot be properly
integrated to restore symmetries, unless the EDFs are generated by true
interactions.
  Purpose: We propose a new method to regularize the MR EDFs, which is based on
using auxiliary quantities obtained by multiplying the kernels with appropriate
powers of overlaps.
  Methods: Regularized matrix elements of two-body interactions are obtained by
integrating the auxiliary quantities and then solving simple linear equations.
  Results: We implement the new regularization method within the
self-consistent Skyrme-Hartree-Fock approach and we perform a
proof-of-principle angular-momentum projection (AMP) of states in odd-odd
nucleus 26Al. We show that for EDFs generated by true interactions, our
regularization method gives results identical to those obtained within the
standard AMP procedure. We also show that for EDFs that do not correspond to
true interactions, it gives stable and converging results that are different
than unstable and non-converging standard AMP values.
  Conclusions: The new regularization method proposed in this work may provide
us with a relatively inexpensive and efficient tool to generalize SR EDFs to MR
applications, thus allowing for symmetry restoration and configuration mixing
performed for typical nuclear EDFs, which most often do not correspond to true
interactions.

ephemeris. However, transit times in circumbinary systems are influenced both
by the gravitational perturbations and the orbital phase variations of the
central binary star. Adopting a coplanar analog of Kepler-16 as an example, we
find that circumbinary planets can transit the same star more than once during
a single planetary orbit, a phenomenon we call ""tight transits"". In certain
geometric, the projected orbital velocity of the planet and the secondary star
can approach zero and change sign, resulting in very long transits and/or 2-3
transits during a single binary orbit. Whether tight transits are possible for
a particular system depends primarily on the binary mass ratio and the orbital
architecture of both the binary and the planet. We derive a time-dependent
criterion to judge when tight transits are possible for any circumbinary
system. These results are verified with full dynamical integrations that also
reveal other tight transit characteristics, i.e., the transit durations and the
intervals between tight transits. For the seven currently known circumbinary
systems, we estimate these critical parameters both analytically and
numerically. Due to the mutual inclination between the planet and the binary,
tight transits can only occur across the less massive star B in Kepler-16, -34,
-35, and -47 (for both planets). The long-term average frequency of tight
transits (compared to typical transits) for Kepler-16, -34, and -35 are
estimated to be several percent. Using full numerical integrations, the next
tight transit for each system is predicted and the soonest example appears to
be Kepler-47b and -47c, which are likely to have tight transits before 2025.
These unique and valuable events often deserve special observational scrutiny.

very-high-energy (VHE; E>100 GeV) gamma-ray source, HESS J1834-087, coincident
with the SNR W41. The origin of the gamma-ray emission has been further
investigated with HESS and the Fermi-LAT. The gamma-ray data provided by 61h
(HESS) and 4 yrs (Fermi LAT) of observations cover over 5 decades in energy
(1.8GeV - 30TeV). The morphology and spectrum of the TeV and GeV sources have
been studied and multi-wavelength data have been used to investigate the origin
of the observed emission. The TeV source can be modeled with a sum of two
components: one point-like and one significantly extended (sig_TeV =
0.17{\deg}), both centered on SNR W41 and exhibiting spectra described by a
power law of index 2.6. The GeV source detected with Fermi is extended (sig_GeV
=0.15{\deg}) and morphologically matches the VHE emission. Its spectrum can be
described by a power-law with index 2.15 and joins smoothly the one of the
whole TeV source. A break appears in the spectra around 100 GeV. Two main
scenarios are proposed to explain the emission: a pulsar wind nebula (PWN) or
the interaction of SNR W41 with a molecular cloud. X-ray observations suggest
the presence of a point-like source (pulsar candidate) near the center of the
SNR and non-thermal X-ray diffuse emission which could arise from a potential
PWN. The PWN scenario is supported by the match of of the TeV and GeV positions
with the putative pulsar. However, the overall spectrum is reproduced by a
1-zone leptonic model only if an excess of low-energy electrons is injected by
a high spin-down power pulsar. This low-energy component is not needed if the
point-like TeV source is unrelated to the extended GeV and TeV sources. The
interacting SNR scenario is supported by the spatial coincidence between the
gamma-ray sources, the detection of OH maser lines and the hadronic modeling.

  cancer: A multiscale computational study",,,,,"q-bio.TO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Chemotherapy is one of the most important therapeutic options used to treat
human cancers, either alone or in combination with radiation therapy and
surgery. Recent studies have indicated that intra-tumoural heterogeneity has a
significant role in driving resistance to chemotherapy in many human
malignancies. Multiple factors including the internal cell-cycle dynamics and
the external microenvironement contribute to the intra-tumoural heterogeneity.
In this paper we present a hybrid, multiscale, individual-based mathematical
model, incorporating internal cell-cycle dynamics and changes in oxygen
concentration, to study the effects of delivery of several different
chemotherapeutic drugs on the heterogeneous subpopulations of cancer cells with
varying cell-cycle dynamics. The computational simulation results from the
multiscale model are in good agreement with available experimental data and
support the hypothesis that slow-cycling sub-populations of tumour cells within
a growing tumour mass can induce drug resistance to chemotherapy and thus the
use of conventional chemotherapy may actually result in the emergence of
dominant, therapy-resistant, slow-cycling subpopulations of tumour cells. Our
results indicate that the appearance of this chemotherapeutic resistance is
mainly due to the inability of the administered drug to target all cancer cells
irrespective of the stage in the cell-cycle they are in i.e. most
chemotherapeutic drugs target cells in a particular phase/phases of the
cell-cycle, and hence always spare some cancer cells that are not in the
targeted cell-cycle phase/phases. The results also suggest that this
cell-cycle-mediated drug resistance may be overcome by using multiple doses of
cell-cycle, phase-specific chemotherapy that targets cells in all phases and
its appropriate sequencing and scheduling.

multicoding and multifunctionality in neural networks that produce and control
rhythmical motor patterns. In some cases, isolating the neurons from their
synaptic network revealsirregular, complex signatures that have been regarded
as evidence of intrinsic, chaotic behavior.
  We show that incorporation of dynamical noise into minimal neuron models of
square-wave bursting (either conductance-based or abstract) produces signatures
akin to those observed in biological examples, without the need for fine-tuning
of parameters or ad hoc constructions for inducing chaotic activity. The form
of the stochastic term is not strongly constrained, and can approximate several
possible sources of noise, e.g. random channel gating or synaptic bombardment.
  The cornerstone of this signature generation mechanism is the rich,
transient, but deterministic dynamics inherent in the square-wave

the dynamics to populate a complex transient scaffolding or skeleton in state
space, even for models that (without added noise) generate only periodic

are expressed in terms of the zeros of the combination of the associated

negative for Dirichlet boundary condition and positive for Neumann one. At

has been intensely studied in gravity-driven vertical systems (e.g. silos and
hoppers). Nevertheless, in many industrial applications, grains are
horizontally transported at constant velocity, lying on conveyor belts or
floating on the surface of flowing liquids. Unlike fluid flows, that are
controlled by the pressure, granular flow is not sensitive to the local
pressure but rather to the local velocity of the grains at the outlet. We can
also expect the flow rate to depend on the local density of the grains. Indeed,
vertical systems are packed in dense configurations by gravity but, in
contrast, in horizontal systems the density can take a large range of values,
potentially very small, which may significantly alter the flow rate. In the
present article, we study, for different initial packing fractions, the
discharge through an orifice of monodisperse grains driven at constant velocity
by a horizontal conveyor belt. We report how, during the discharge, the packing
fraction is modified by the presence of the outlet and we analyze how changes

dependencies, which allows to perform prediction at arbitrary locations. This
approach combines established methods to model (spatial) dependencies. On the
one hand the geostatistical concept utilizing spatial differences between the
variable locations to model the extend of spatial dependencies is applied. On
the other hand the flexible class of C-vine copulas is utilized to model the
spatial dependency structure locally. These local C-vine copulas are
parametrized jointly, exploiting an existing relationship between the copula
parameters and the respective spatial distances and elevation differences, and
are combined in a composite likelihood approach. The new methodology called
spatial local C-vine composite likelihood (S-LCVCL) method benefits from the
fact that it is able to capture non-Gaussian dependency structures. The
development and validation of the new methodology is illustrated using a data
set of daily mean temperatures observed at 73 observation stations spread over
Germany. For validation continuous ranked probability scores are utilized.
Comparison with two other approaches of spatial dependency modeling introduced

computing environment equipped with both dynamic speed scaling and sleep state
capabilities: Each task is specified by a release time, a deadline and a
processing volume, and has to be scheduled on a single, speed-scalable
processor that is supplied with a sleep state. In the sleep state, the
processor consumes no energy, but a constant wake-up cost is required to
transition back to the active state. In contrast to speed scaling alone, the
addition of a sleep state makes it sometimes beneficial to accelerate the
processing of tasks in order to transition the processor to the sleep state for
longer amounts of time and incur further energy savings. The goal is to output
a feasible schedule that minimizes the energy consumption. Since the
introduction of the problem by Irani et al. [16], its exact computational
complexity has been repeatedly posed as an open question (see e.g. [2,8,15]).
The currently best known upper and lower bounds are a 4/3-approximation

aforementioned gap between the upper and lower bound on the computational
complexity of speed scaling with sleep state by presenting a fully
polynomial-time approximation scheme for the problem. The scheme is based on a
transformation to a non-preemptive variant of the problem, and a discretization
that exploits a carefully defined lexicographical ordering among schedules.

DNA sets a lower bound on how accurately a cell can regulate its protein
levels. Using results from the literature on diffusion-influenced reactions, we
derive an analytical expression for the lower bound on the precision of
transcriptional regulation. In our theory, transcription factors can perform
multiple rounds of 1D diffusion along the DNA and 3D diffusion in the cytoplasm
before binding to the promoter. Comparing our expression for the lower bound on
the precision against results from Green's Function Reaction Dynamics
simulations shows that the theory is highly accurate under biologically
relevant conditions. Our results demonstrate that, to an excellent
approximation, the promoter switches between the transcription-factor bound and
unbound state in a Markovian fashion. This remains true even in the presence of
sliding, i.e. with 1D diffusion along the DNA. This has two important
implications: (1) minimizing the noise in the promoter state is equivalent to
minimizing the search time of transcription factors for their promoters; (2)
the complicated dynamics of 3D diffusion in the cytoplasm and 1D diffusion
along the DNA can be captured in a well-stirred model by renormalizing the
promoter association and dissociation rates, making it possible to efficiently
simulate the promoter dynamics using Gillespie simulations. Based on the recent
experimental observation that sliding can speed up the promoter search by a
factor of 4, our theory predicts that sliding can enhance the precision of
transcriptional regulation by a factor of 2.

element method is one of the key applications of high performance computing.
Local assembly is its characteristic operation. This entails the execution of a
problem-specific kernel to numerically evaluate an integral for each element in
the discretized problem domain. Since the domain size can be huge, executing
efficient kernels is fundamental. Their op- timization is, however, a
challenging issue. Even though affine loop nests are generally present, the
short trip counts and the complexity of mathematical expressions make it hard
to determine a single or unique sequence of successful transformations.
Therefore, we present the design and systematic evaluation of COF- FEE, a
domain-specific compiler for local assembly kernels. COFFEE manipulates
abstract syntax trees generated from a high-level domain-specific language for
PDEs by introducing domain-aware composable optimizations aimed at improving
instruction-level parallelism, especially SIMD vectorization, and register
locality. It then generates C code including vector intrinsics. Experiments
using a range of finite-element forms of increasing complexity show that
significant performance improvement is achieved.

characterized by a fast inner spine surrounded by a slower layer. This scenario
has been widely discussed in the framework of the high-energy emission models
for BL Lacs and radiogalaxies. One of the relevant consequences of a velocity
structure is the enhancement of the inverse Compton emission caused by the
radiative coupling of the two zones. We show that a similar boosting could
occur for the neutrino output of the spine through the photo-meson reaction of
high-energy protons scattering off the amplified soft target photon field of
the layer. Assuming the local density and the cosmological evolution of
$\gamma$-ray BL Lac derived from {\it Fermi}-LAT data, we calculate the
expected diffuse neutrino intensity, that can match the IceCube data for a
reasonable choice of the parameters.

extents comparable to the field-of-view of current imaging air-Cherenkov
telescopes (IACT) require additional observations of source-free regions to
estimate the background contribution to the energy spectrum. This reduces the
effective observation time and deteriorates the sensitivity. A new method of
reconstructing spectra from IACT data without the need of additional
observations of source-free regions is developed. Its application is not
restricted to any specific IACT or data format. On the basis of the template
background method, which defines the background in air-shower parameter space,
a new spectral reconstruction method from IACT data is developed and studied,
the Template Background Spectrum (TBS); TBS is tested on published H.E.S.S.
data and H.E.S.S. results. Good agreement is found between VHE gamma-ray
spectra reported by the H.E.S.S. collaboration and those re-analysed with TBS.
This includes analyses of point-like sources, sources in crowded regions, and
of very extended sources down to sources with fluxes of a few percent of the
Crab Nebula flux and excess-to-background ratios around 0.1. However, the TBS
background normalisation introduces new statistical and systematic errors which
are accounted for, but may constitute a limiting case for very faint extended
sources. The TBS method enables the spectral reconstruction of data when other
methods are hampered or even fail. It does not need dedicated observations of
VHE gamma-ray-free regions (e.g. as the On/Off background does) and circumvents
known geometrical limitations to which other methods (e.g. the reflected-region
background) for reconstructing spectral information of VHE gamma-ray emission
regions are prone to; TBS would be, in specific cases, the only feasible way to
reconstruct energy spectra.

rotating star when some angular momentum loss due to mass loss is present. We
especially wish to know when the spin-down flow forced by the mass loss
supersedes the baroclinic flows that pervade the radiative envelope of rotating
stars. We consider a Boussinesq fluid enclosed in a rigid sphere whose flows
are forced both by the baroclinic torque, the spin-down of an outer layer, and
an outward mass flux. The spin-down forcing is idealized in two ways: either by
a rigid layer that imposes its spinning down velocity at some interface or by a
turbulent layer that imposes a stress at this same interface to the interior of
the star. In the case where the layer is rigid and imposes its velocity, we
find that, as the mass-loss rate increases, the flow inside the star shows two
transitions: the meridional circulation associated with baroclinic flows is
first replaced by its spin-down counterpart, while at much stronger mass-loss
rates the baroclinic differential rotation is superseded by the spin-down
differential rotation. In fact, we find three wind regimes: weak (or no wind),
moderate, and strong. In the first case, the flow in the radiative envelope is
of baroclinic origin. In the moderate case, the circulation results from the
spin-down while the differential rotation may either be of baroclinic or of
spin-down origin, depending on the coupling between mass and angular momentum
losses. For fast rotating stars, our model says that the moderate wind regime

the flow in the radiative envelope is mainly driven by angular momentum
advection. This latter transition depends on the mass and the rotation rate of
the star, being around 1e-8 Msun/yr for a 3 Msun ZAMS star rotating at 200 km/s

into the intrinsic properties of the class of polar sets of martingale

Arbitrage is equivalent to the existence of a martingale measure; for
$\mathcal{S}$ being the open sets, absence of Open Arbitrage is equivalent to
the existence of full support martingale measures. These results are obtained
by adopting a technical filtration enlargement and by constructing a universal
aggregator of all arbitrage opportunities. We further introduce the notion of
market feasibility and provide its characterization via arbitrage conditions.
We conclude providing a dual representation of Open Arbitrage in terms of
weakly open sets of probability measures, which highlights the robust nature of

more difficult, if not impossible, to predict the time such transitions occur

persistent attacks in which the magnitude of the attack is quantified by the
probability of an internal failure, and there is some chance that an internal
failure will be permanent. When the fraction of active neighbors declines to a
critical threshold, cascading failures trigger a network breakdown. For this
class of network we find both numerically and analytically that the time to the

upon the magnitude of the attack and logarithmically dependent on the

and use the network lifetime as a measure of dynamical network robustness
offering new methodological insight into system dynamics.

relatively light, around or below a few hundred GeV, as long as the heavy

is that the embedded gravitational potential well in X-ray binaries is much
deeper than those found in cataclysmic variables. As a result, X-ray binaries
emit most of their radiation at X-ray wavelengths, as opposed to cataclysmic
variables which emit mostly at optical/ultraviolet wavelengths. Both types of

Most merge sorting networks are based on 2-way or multi-way merging algorithms
using 2-sorters as basic building blocks. An alternative is to use n-sorters,
instead of 2-sorters, as the basic building blocks so as to greatly reduce the
number of sorters as well as the latency. Based on a modified Leighton's
columnsort algorithm, an n-way merging algorithm, referred to as SS-Mk, that
uses n-sorters as basic building blocks was proposed. In this work, we first
propose a new multiway merging algorithm with n-sorters as basic building
blocks that merges n sorted lists of m values each in 1 + ceil(m/2) stages (n
<= m). Based on our merging algorithm, we also propose a sorting algorithm,
which requires O(N log2 N) basic sorters to sort N inputs. While the asymptotic
complexity (in terms of the required number of sorters) of our sorting
algorithm is the same as the SS-Mk, for wide ranges of N, our algorithm
requires fewer sorters than the SS-Mk. Finally, we consider a binary sorting
network, where the basic sorter is implemented in threshold logic and scales
linearly with the number of inputs, and compare the complexity in terms of the
required number of gates. For wide ranges of N, our algorithm requires fewer

C70) have been detected in a wide variety of circumstellar and interstellar
environments showing that when conditions are favourable, fullerenes are formed
efficiently. Fullerenes are the first and only large aromatics firmly
identified in space. The detection of fullerenes is thus crucial to provide
clues as to the key chemical pathways leading to the formation of large complex
organic molecules in space, and offers a great diagnostic tool to describe the
environment in which they reside. Since fullerenes share many physical
properties with PAHs, understanding how fullerenes form, evolve and respond to
their physical environment will yield important insights into one of the
largest reservoirs of organic material in space. In spite of all these

of noncommutative $L^p$-spaces regarded as Banach modules over the underlying
von Neumann algebra $\mathcal M$.
  Our approach combines Kalton's description of extensions by centralizers
(these are certain maps which are, in general, neither linear nor bounded) with
a general principle, due to Rochberg and Weiss saying that whenever one finds a
given Banach space $Y$ as an intermediate space in a (complex) interpolation
scale, one automatically gets a self-extension $ 0\longrightarrow
Y\longrightarrow X\longrightarrow Y \longrightarrow 0. $
  For semifinite algebras, considering $L^p=L^p(\mathcal M,\tau)$ as an
interpolation space between $\mathcal M$ and its predual $\mathcal M_*$ one
arrives at a certain self-extension of $L^p$ that is a kind of noncommutative
Kalton-Peck space and carries a natural bimodule structure. Some interesting
properties of these spaces are presented.
  For general algebras, including those of type III, the interpolation
mechanism produces two (rather than one) extensions of one sided modules, one
of left-modules and the other of right-modules. Whether or not one can find
(nontrivial) self-extensions of bimodules in all cases is left open.

performed at high magnetic fields and low temperatures in a series of $n$-type
Bi$_{2}$Se$_{3}$ crystals. In low density samples, a complete spin polarization
of the electronic system is achieved, as observed from the saturation of the
isotropic component of the $^{209}$Bi NMR shift above a certain magnetic field.
The corresponding spin splitting, defined in the phenomenological approach of a
3D electron gas with a large (spin-orbit-induced) effective $g$-factor, scales
as expected with the Fermi energy independently determined by simultaneous
transport measurements. Both the effective electronic $g$-factor and the
""contact"" hyperfine coupling constant are precisely determined. The magnitude
of this latter reveals a non negligible $s$-character of the electronic wave
function at the bottom of the conduction band. Our results show that the bulk
electronic spin polarization can be directly probed via NMR and pave the way
for future NMR investigations of the electronic states in Bi-based topological
insulators.

binomial $\binom{2k}{k}$ in numerators and denominators. A large class of these
functions emerges in the calculation of massive Feynman diagrams with local
operator insertions starting at 3-loop order in the coupling constant and
extends the classes of the nested harmonic, generalized harmonic and cyclotomic
sums. The binomially weighted sums are associated by the Mellin transform to
iterated integrals over square-root valued alphabets. The values of the sums
for $N \rightarrow \infty$ and the iterated integrals at $x=1$ lead to new
constants, extending the set of special numbers given by the multiple zeta
values, the cyclotomic zeta values and special constants which emerge in the
limit $N \rightarrow \infty$ of generalized harmonic sums. We develop
algorithms to obtain the Mellin representations of these sums in a systematic
way. They are of importance for the derivation of the asymptotic expansion of
these sums and their analytic continuation to $N \in \mathbb{C}$. The
associated convolution relations are derived for real parameters and can
therefore be used in a wider context, as e.g. for multi-scale processes. We
also derive algorithms to transform iterated integrals over root-valued
alphabets into binomial sums. Using generating functions we study a few aspects
of infinite (inverse) binomial sums.

oscillations of charged particles. I discuss two situations when a Langmuir
soliton can be stable. In the former case the stability of solitons against the
collapse is due to electron-electron interactions which result in the nonlocal
terms in the nonlinear Schr\""{o}dinger equation. In the latter situation I
derive the new cubic-quintic nonlinear Schr\""{o}dinger equation with accounts
for the interaction of induced dipole moments of diatomic ions with a rapidly
oscillating electric field and show that the collapse of Langmuir waves can be
also arrested. In both cases I find the numerical solutions of the nonlinear
Schr\""{o}dinger equation and analyze their stability using the
Vakhitov-Kolokolov criterion. I discuss the application of my results for the
description of long-lived atmospheric plasma structures. I show that, using my
model, one can explain the existence of atmospheric plasmoids in the upper
ionosphere. It is also demonstrated that Langmuir solitons described by the
cubic-quintic nonlinear Schr\""{o}dinger equation can describe atmospheric
plasmoids at the initial stages of their evolution. Note that, besides the
modeling of atmospheric plasma structures, my results can be applied for the
explanation of the results of experiments where long-lived glowing plasmoids
weere obtained in electric discharges in liquid nitrogen.
