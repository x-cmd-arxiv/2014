detect polarity of the speech signals by estimating instants of significant
excitation of the vocaltract and the cosine phase of the analytic signal
representation. The phase changes in the analytic signal around the Hilbert
envelope (HE) peaks are found to vary according to the polarity of the given
speech signal. The relevant HE peaks for the Hilbert phase analysis are
selected by estimating the instants of significant excitation in speech. The
speech polarity identification rate obtained for the proposed method is almost
equal to the state of the art residual skewness method for speech polarity
detection. The proposed method also provides the same results for the polarity
detection in electro-glottogram signals. Finally, the robustness of the
proposed method is confirmed from the reduced detection error rates obtained in
noisy environments with various signal to noise ratios (SNRs). The MATLAB codes
used for implementing the proposed method are available for download from the

adaptive use of local image measurements. More precisely, we specify a
graphical model for human pose which exploits the fact the local image
measurements can be used both to detect parts (or joints) and also to predict
the spatial relationships between them (Image Dependent Pairwise Relations).
These spatial relationships are represented by a mixture model. We use Deep
Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNNs) to learn conditional probabilities for
the presence of parts and their spatial relationships within image patches.
Hence our model combines the representational flexibility of graphical models
with the efficiency and statistical power of DCNNs. Our method significantly
outperforms the state of the art methods on the LSP and FLIC datasets and also
performs very well on the Buffy dataset without any training.

some contribution in order to alleviate the cosmic coincidence problem. It is
assumed that the potential which characterizes the ELKO field is not specified,
but it is related to a constant parameter $\delta$. The strength of the
interaction between matter and ELKO field is characterized by a constant
parameter $\beta$ and it is also assumed that both ELKO field as matter energy

$\omega_\phi$ and $\omega_m$, respectively. The system of equations is analysed
by a dynamical system approach. It has been found the conditions of stability
between the parameters $\delta$ and $\beta$ in order to have stable fixed

$\omega_\phi$ and $\omega_m$, and the results are presented in form of tables.
The possibility of decay of ELKO field into dark matter or vice versa can be
read directly from the tables, since the parameters $\delta$ and $\beta$
satisfy some inequalities. It allows us to constrain the potential assuming
that we have a stable system for different interactions terms between the ELKO

experimental observation of spontaneous magnon decay in a quasi-one-dimensional

up-chirped plasmons ($d{\omega^2_{pe}(x)}/{dx}>0$). Therefore phase mixing
between plasmons can lead to trapping until the plasmon field is high enough
such that $e^-$ trajectories returning towards a longer wavelength see a
trapping potential. Rising plasma density gradients are ubiquitous for
confining the plasma within sources at the vacuum-plasma interfaces. Therefore
trapping of plasma-$e^-$ in a rising ramp is important for acceleration
diagnostics and to understand the energy dissipation from the excited plasmon
train \cite{LTE-2013}. Down-ramp in density \cite{density-transition-2001} has
been used for plasma-$e^-$ trapping within the first bucket behind the driver.
Here, in rising density gradient the trapping does not occur in the first
plasmon bucket but in subsequent plasmon buckets behind the driver. Trapping
reduces the Hamiltonian of each bucket where $e^-$ are trapped, so it is a
wakefield-decay probe. Preliminary computational results for beam and
laser-driven wakefield are shown.

interactions greatly influence the thermodynamic properties of polymer systems,
a predictive molecular theory that enables systematically addressing the role
of chemical structure and specific interactions has been slow to develop even
for polymer melts. While the lattice cluster theory (LCT) provides a powerful
vehicle for understanding the influence of various molecular factors, such as
monomer structure, on the thermodynamic properties of polymer melts and blends,
the application of the LCT has heretofore been limited to the use of the
simplest polymer model in which all united atom groups within the monomers of a
species interact with a common monomer averaged van der Waals energy. Thus, the
description of a compressible polymer melt involves a single van der Waals
energy. As a first step towards developing more realistic descriptions to aid
in the analysis of experimental data and the design of new materials, the LCT
is extended here to treat models of polymer melts in which the backbone and
side groups have different interaction strengths, so three energy parameters
are present, namely, backbone-backbone, side group-side group, and
backbone-side group interaction energies. Because of the great algebraic
complexity of this extension, we retain maximal simplicity within this class of
models by further specializing this initial study to models of polymer melts
comprising chains with poly($n$-$\alpha$-olefin) structures where only the end
segments on the side chains may have different, specific van der Waals
interaction energies with the other united atom groups. An analytical
expression for the LCT Helmholtz free energy is derived for the new model.
Illustrative calculations are presented to demonstrate the degree to which the
thermodynamic properties of polymer melts can be controlled by specific
interactions.

neocortex, including the thalamocortical loops through the deep layers, can
support a temporal context representation in the service of predictive
learning. Many have argued that predictive learning provides a compelling,
powerful source of learning signals to drive the development of human
intelligence: if we constantly predict what will happen next, and learn based
on the discrepancies from our predictions (error-driven learning), then we can
learn to improve our predictions by developing internal representations that
capture the regularities of the environment (e.g., physical laws governing the
time-evolution of object motions). Our version of this idea builds upon
existing work with simple recurrent networks (SRN's), which have a
discretely-updated temporal context representations that are a direct copy of
the prior internal state representation. We argue that this discretization of
temporal context updating has a number of important computational and
functional advantages, and further show how the strong alpha-frequency (10hz,
100ms cycle time) oscillations in the posterior neocortex could reflect this
temporal context updating. We examine a wide range of data from biology to
behavior through the lens of this LeabraTI model, and find that it provides a
unified account of a number of otherwise disconnected findings, all of which
converge to support this new model of neocortical learning and processing. We
describe an implemented model showing how predictive learning of tumbling
object trajectories can facilitate object recognition with cluttered

any ball of that radius contains only a constant number of codewords. The list
decoding radius is not well understood even for well studied codes, like
Reed-Solomon or Reed-Muller codes.
  Fix a finite field $\mathbb{F}$. The Reed-Muller code
$\mathrm{RM}_{\mathbb{F}}(n,d)$ is defined by $n$-variate degree-$d$
polynomials over $\mathbb{F}$. In this work, we study the list decoding radius
of Reed-Muller codes over a constant prime field $\mathbb{F}=\mathbb{F}_p$,
constant degree $d$ and large $n$. We show that the list decoding radius is
equal to the minimal distance of the code.
  That is, if we denote by $\delta(d)$ the normalized minimal distance of
$\mathrm{RM}_{\mathbb{F}}(n,d)$, then the number of codewords in any ball of
radius $\delta(d)-\varepsilon$ is bounded by $c=c(p,d,\varepsilon)$ independent
of $n$. This resolves a conjecture of Gopalan-Klivans-Zuckerman [STOC 2008],
who among other results proved it in the special case of
$\mathbb{F}=\mathbb{F}_2$; and extends the work of Gopalan [FOCS 2010] who
proved the conjecture in the case of $d=2$.
  We also analyse the number of codewords in balls of radius exceeding the
minimal distance of the code. For $e \leq d$, we show that the number of
codewords of $\mathrm{RM}_{\mathbb{F}}(n,d)$ in a ball of radius $\delta(e) -
\varepsilon$ is bounded by $\exp(c \cdot n^{d-e})$, where
$c=c(p,d,\varepsilon)$ is independent of $n$. The dependence on $n$ is tight.
This extends the work of Kaufman-Lovett-Porat [IEEE Inf. Theory 2012] who
proved similar bounds over $\mathbb{F}_2$.
  The proof relies on several new ingredients: an extension of the
Frieze-Kannan weak regularity to general function spaces, higher-order Fourier
analysis, and an extension of the Schwartz-Zippel lemma to compositions of
polynomials.

increasing transmitting power of SUs does not always benefit to SU's
throughput, which implies the existence of a power-throughput tradeoff.
Besides, though the LAT protocol suffers from self-interference, it allows
longer transmission time, while the performance of the traditional LBT protocol
is limited by channel spatial correction and relatively shorter transmission
period. To this end, we also present an adaptive scheme to improve SUs'

enhances the inter-orbital Coulomb interaction (relative to other interactions)

applied to cosmological simulations, and the reconstructed linear density
fields are then evolved to the present day with N-body simulations. The
constrained simulations so obtained accurately reproduce both the amplitudes

half of the phase information down to a scale k~0.85 h/Mpc at high z and to
k~3.4 h/Mpc at z=0, which represents a significant improvement over similar
reconstruction models in the literature, and indicates that our model can
reconstruct the formation histories of cosmic structures over a large dynamical
range. Adopting PM models with higher spatial and temporal resolutions yields
even better reconstructions, suggesting that our method is limited more by the
availability of computer resource than by principle. Dynamic models of
structure evolution adopted in many earlier investigations can induce
non-Gaussianity in the reconstructed linear density field, which in turn can
cause large systematic deviations in the predicted halo mass function. Such

technique for accurate mass measurements of short-lived nuclides with relative
precision of about $10^{-5}-10^{-7}$. Instabilities of the magnetic fields in
storage rings are one of the major contributions limiting the achievable mass
resolving power, which is directly related to the precision of the obtained
mass values. A new data analysis method is proposed allowing one to minimise
the effect of such instabilities. The masses of the previously measured at the
CSRe $^{41}$Ti, $^{43}$V, $^{47}$Mn, $^{49}$Fe, $^{53}$Ni and $^{55}$Cu
nuclides were re-determined with this method. An improvement of the mass
precision by a factor of $\sim 1.7$ has been achieved for $^{41}$Ti and
$^{43}$V. The method can be applied to any isochronous mass experiment
irrespective of the accelerator facility. Furthermore, the method can be used
as an on-line tool for checking the isochronous conditions of the storage ring.

streamline of a reference flow. Two complementary schemes are presented: a
graphical approach for individual cases, and an analytical approach for general
properties. The spatially nonlinear interaction of dynamic variability and the
reference flow results in flux variability. The characteristic time-scale of
the dynamic variability and the length-scale of the flux variability in a unit
of flight-time govern the spatio-temporal interaction that leads to transport.
The non-dimensional ratio of the two characteristic scales is shown to be a a
critical parameter. The pseudo-lobe sequence along the reference streamline
describes spatial coherency and temporal evolution of transport. For
finite-time transport from an initial time up to the present, the
characteristic length-scale of the flux variability regulates the width of the
pseudo-lobes. The phase speed of pseudo-lobe propagation averages the reference
flow and the flux variability. In contrast, for definite transport over a fixed
time interval and spatial segment, the characteristic time-scale of the dynamic
variability regulates the width of the pseudo-lobes. Generation of the
pseudo-lobe sequence appears to be synchronous with the dynamic variability,
although it propagates with the reference flow. In either case, the critical
characteristic ratio is found to be one, corresponding to a resonance of the
flux variability with the reference flow. Using a kinematic model, we
demonstrate the framework for two types of transport in a blocked flow of the
mid-latitude atmosphere: across the meandering jet axis and between the jet and
recirculating cell.

  proven. The result on counting triangles was previously included in an ECCC
  technical report by Chakrabarti et al. available at
  http://eccc.hpi-web.de/report/2013/180/. That report has been superseded by
  this manuscript, and the CCC 2015 paper ""Verifiable Stream Computation and
  Arthur-Merlin Communication"" by Chakrabarti et al",,,,"cs.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Considerable effort has been devoted to the development of streaming
algorithms for analyzing massive graphs. Unfortunately, many results have been
negative, establishing that a wide variety of problems require $\Omega(n^2)$
space to solve. One of the few bright spots has been the development of
semi-streaming algorithms for a handful of graph problems -- these algorithms
use space $O(n\cdot\text{polylog}(n))$.
  In the annotated data streaming model of Chakrabarti et al., a
computationally limited client wants to compute some property of a massive
input, but lacks the resources to store even a small fraction of the input, and
hence cannot perform the desired computation locally. The client therefore
accesses a powerful but untrusted service provider, who not only performs the
requested computation, but also proves that the answer is correct.
  We put forth the notion of semi-streaming algorithms for annotated graph
streams (semi-streaming annotation schemes for short). These are protocols in
which both the client's space usage and the length of the proof are $O(n \cdot
\text{polylog}(n))$. We give evidence that semi-streaming annotation schemes
represent a substantially more robust solution concept than does the standard
semi-streaming model. On the positive side, we give semi-streaming annotation
schemes for two dynamic graph problems that are intractable in the standard
model: (exactly) counting triangles, and (exactly) computing maximum matchings.
The former scheme answers a question of Cormode. On the negative side, we
identify for the first time two natural graph problems (connectivity and
bipartiteness in a certain edge update model) that can be solved in the
standard semi-streaming model, but cannot be solved by annotation schemes of
""sub-semi-streaming"" cost. That is, these problems are just as hard in the
annotations model as they are in the standard model.

relative to the prior, only on a low-dimensional subspace of the parameter
space. Significant computational savings can be achieved by using this subspace
to characterize and approximate the posterior distribution of the parameters.
We first investigate approximation of the posterior covariance matrix as a
low-rank update of the prior covariance matrix. We prove optimality of a
particular update, based on the leading eigendirections of the matrix pencil
defined by the Hessian of the negative log-likelihood and the prior precision,
for a broad class of loss functions. This class includes the F\""{o}rstner
metric for symmetric positive definite matrices, as well as the
Kullback-Leibler divergence and the Hellinger distance between the associated
distributions. We also propose two fast approximations of the posterior mean
and prove their optimality with respect to a weighted Bayes risk under
squared-error loss. These approximations are deployed in an offline-online
manner, where a more costly but data-independent offline calculation is
followed by fast online evaluations. As a result, these approximations are
particularly useful when repeated posterior mean evaluations are required for
multiple data sets. We demonstrate our theoretical results with several
numerical examples, including high-dimensional X-ray tomography and an inverse
heat conduction problem. In both of these examples, the intrinsic
low-dimensional structure of the inference problem can be exploited while
producing results that are essentially indistinguishable from solutions
computed in the full space.

social environment, and how the classification of \emph{distinct} and
\emph{vulgar}, among others, arises from at the same time as shapes this taste
in his work called \emph{La Distinction}. Robert Axelrod created a
computational model with local convergence and global polarization properties
to describe the dissemination of culture by simple selective interactions. In
this letter, Axelrod model is modified, while holding to the same original
principles, to describe Bourdieu theory. This allows to analyze how the
dynamics of society's tastes and trends may vary with a simple approach,
considering social structures and to understand which social forces are crucial
to change dynamics. Despite the relative simplicity, the present approach
clarifies symbolic power relations, a relevant issue for understanding power
relation both on large as well as on small and localized scale, with impact on
activities ranging from daily life matters to business, politics, and research.
This model sheds light on social issues, showing that a small amount of
conflict within a class plays a central role in the culture dynamics, being the
major responsible for continuous changes in distinction paradigms.

heart of modern electronic technology. It is also a driving force behind recent
advances in two-dimensional systems, such as gate-electric-field induced
superconductivity and metal-insulator transition. Here we describe an ionic
field-effect transistor (termed ""iFET""), which uses gate-controlled lithium ion
intercalation to modulate the material property of layered atomic crystal
1T-TaS$_2$. The extreme charge doping induced by the tunable ion intercalation
alters the energetics of various charge-ordered states in 1T-TaS$_2$, and
produces a series of phase transitions in thin-flake samples with reduced
dimensionality. We find that the charge-density-wave states in 1T-TaS$_2$ are
three-dimensional in nature, and completely collapse in the two-dimensional
limit defined by their critical thicknesses. Meanwhile the ionic gating induces
multiple phase transitions from Mott-insulator to metal in 1T-TaS$_2$ thin
flakes at low temperatures, with 5 orders of magnitude modulation in their
resistance. Superconductivity emerges in a textured charge-density-wave state
induced by ionic gating. Our method of gate-controlled intercalation of 2D
atomic crystals in the bulk limit opens up new possibilities in searching for
novel states of matter in the extreme charge-carrier-concentration limit.

this note, we determine the finite fields whose multiplicative groups are
direct sum indecomposable. We obtain our classification using a direct argument
and also as a corollary to Catalan's Conjecture. Turning to infinite fields, we
prove that any infinite field whose characteristic is not equal to 2 must have
a decomposable multiplicative group. We conjecture that this is also true for
infinite fields of characteristic 2 and we narrow the class of possible
counter-examples. Finally, using the classification of finite commutative
primary rings with cyclic multiplicative groups, we determine all finite
commutative rings with indecomposable multiplicative groups.

the discrimination of chiral states for an ensemble of molecules in a

potential and the environment is modeled as a bath of harmonic oscillators. We
carefully analyze different time-scales appearing in the resulting master
equation at both weak- and strong-coupling limits. The corresponding results
are accompanied by a set of coupled differential equations characterizing
optical activity of the molecules. We show that, at the weak-coupling limit,
chiral interactions prohibit the coherent racemization induced by decoherence
effects and thus preserve the initial chiral state. At the strong-coupling
limit, considering the memory effects of the environment, Markovian behavior is
observed at long times.

fundamental problem for different areas of study. Many current methods rely on
parameters requiring calibration from empirical trip volumes. Their values are
often not generalizable to cases without calibration data. To solve this
problem we develop a statistical expression to calculate commuting trips with a
quantitative functional form to estimate the model parameter when empirical
trip data is not available. We calculate commuting trip volumes at scales from
within a city to an entire country, introducing a scaling parameter alpha to
the recently proposed parameter free radiation model. The model requires only
widely available population and facility density distributions. The parameter
can be interpreted as the influence of the region scale and the degree of
heterogeneity in the facility distribution. We explore in detail the scaling
limitations of this problem, namely under which conditions the proposed model
can be applied without trip data for calibration. On the other hand, when
empirical trip data is available, we show that the proposed model's estimation
accuracy is as good as other existing models. We validated the model in
different regions in the U.S., then successfully applied it in three different
countries.
