galaxy M32 are investigated using ground and space-based observations that span
the 1 - 8um wavelength interval, with the goal of demonstrating the utility of
infrared observations as probes of stellar content. Comparisons with isochrones
indicate that the brightest resolved stars in M32 have ages of a few Gyr, and
are younger on average than AGB stars with the same intrinsic brightness in the
outer disk of M31. Accounting for stellar variability is shown to be essential
for modelling AGB luminosity functions (LFs). Model LFs that assume the
star-forming history measured by Monachesi et al. (2012, ApJ, 745, 97) and the
variability properties of Galactic AGB stars match both the K and [5.8] LFs of
M32. Models also suggest that the slope of the [5.8] LF between M_[5.8] = -8.5
and --10.0 is sensitive to the mix of stellar ages, and a sizeable fraction of
the stars in M32 must have an age older than 7 Gyr in order to match the [5.8]
LF. The structural properties of M32 in the infrared are also investigated. The
effective radii that are computed from near-infrared and mid-infrared isophotes
are similar to those measured at visible wavelengths, suggesting that the
stellar content of M32 is well-mixed. However, isophotes at radii > 16 arcsec
(> 60 parsecs) in the near and mid-infrared are flatter than those at visible
wavelengths. The coefficient of the fourth-order cosine term in the fourier
expansion of isophotes changes from `boxy' values at r < 16 arcsec to `disky'
values at r > 48 arcsec in [3.6] and [4.5]. The mid-infrared colors near the
center of M32 do not vary systematically with radius, providing evidence of a
well-mixed stellar content in this part of the galaxy.

cores with radiative transfer evolutionary models to generate synthetic
observations. We then use these synthetic observations to investigate the
extent to which a simple method for measuring protostellar disc masses used in
the literature recovers the intrinsic masses of the discs formed in the
simulations. We evaluate the effects of contamination from the surrounding
core, partially resolving out the disc, optical depth, fixed assumed dust
temperatures, inclination, and the dust opacity law. We show that the
combination of these effects can lead to disc mass underestimates by up to
factors of 2-3 at millimeter wavelengths and up to an order of magnitude or
larger at submillimeter wavelengths. The optically thin portions of
protostellar discs are generally cooler in the Class I stage than the Class 0
stage since Class I discs are typically larger and more optically thick, and
thus more shielded. The observed disc mass distribution closely resembles the
intrinsic distribution if this effect is taken into account, especially at
millimeter wavelengths where optical depth effects are minimized. Approximately
50%-70% of protostellar discs observed to date with this method are consistent
with the masses of the gravitationally unstable discs formed in the
simulations, suggesting that at least some protostellar discs are likely
sufficiently massive to fragment. We emphasize key future work needed to
confirm these results, including assembling larger, less biased samples, and
using molecular line observations to distinguish between rotationally
supported, Keplerian discs and magnetically supported pseudodiscs.

statement on the possible $\alpha$-attractor models which can obtained upon
truncation. We find that in symmetric $\mathcal{N}=2$ models group theoretical
constraints restrict the allowed values of the parameter $\alpha$ to be
$\alpha=1,\,\frac{2}{3},\, \frac{1}{3}$. This confirms and generalizes results
recently obtained in the literature. Our analysis heavily relies on the

simple stellar populations, while those in NGC1795 and IC2146 are not. We
determine the evolution of the clusters' masses and escape velocities from an

extended clusters (NGC2209 and IC2146) experienced stronger levels of initial
mass segregation than the currently compact ones (NGC2249 and NGC1795). Under
this assumption, we find that NGC2209 and NGC2249 have estimated escape
velocities $V_{\rm esc}$ $\geq$ 15 km s$^{-1}$ at an age of 10 Myr, large
enough to retain material ejected by slow winds of first-generation stars,
while the two clusters that do not feature extended MSTOs have $V_{\rm esc}$
$\leq$ 12 km s$^{-1}$ at that age. These results suggest that the extended MSTO
phenomenon can be better explained by a range of stellar ages rather than a
range of stellar rotation velocities or interacting binaries.

efficiency and fairness. The NUM methodology provides a rigorous framework to
design a broad family of simple and decentralized algorithms, with proved
convergence guarantees to a fair allocation solution. In this context, we focus

context of the MSSM including several improvements, such as the mixing of the
fine-tuning conditions for different soft terms and the presence of potential
extra fine-tunings that must be combined with the electroweak one. We give
tables and plots that allow to easily evaluate the fine-tuning and the
corresponding naturalness bounds for any theoretical model defined at any
high-energy (HE) scale. Then, we analyze in detail the complete fine-tuning
bounds for the unconstrained MSSM, defined at any HE scale. We show that
Natural SUSY does not demand light stops. Actually, an average stop mass below
800 GeV is disfavored, though one of the stops might be very light. Regarding
phenomenology, the most stringent upper bound from naturalness is the one on
the gluino mass, which typically sets the present level of fine-tuning at
${\cal O}(1\%)$. However, this result presents a strong dependence on the HE
scale. E.g. if the latter is $10^7$ GeV the level of fine-tuning is $\sim$ four
times less severe. Finally, the most robust result of Natural SUSY is by far
that Higgsinos should be rather light, certainly below 700 GeV for a
fine-tuning of ${\cal O}(1\%)$ or milder. Incidentally, this upper bound is not
far from $\simeq1$ TeV, which is the value required if dark matter is made of

quantifying uncertainty in stochastic gradient systems with isotropic
diffusion. The central idea is to apply the diffusion maps algorithm to a
training data set to produce a stochastic matrix whose generator is a discrete
approximation to the backward Kolmogorov operator of the underlying dynamics.
The eigenvectors of this stochastic matrix, which we will refer to as the
diffusion coordinates, are discrete approximations to the eigenfunctions of the
Kolmogorov operator and form an orthonormal basis for functions defined on the
data set. Using this basis, we consider the projection of three uncertainty
quantification (UQ) problems (prediction, filtering, and response) into the
diffusion coordinates. In these coordinates, the nonlinear prediction and
response problems reduce to solving systems of infinite-dimensional linear
ordinary differential equations. Similarly, the continuous-time nonlinear
filtering problem reduces to solving a system of infinite-dimensional linear
stochastic differential equations. Solving the UQ problems then reduces to
solving the corresponding truncated linear systems in finitely many diffusion
coordinates. By solving these systems we give a model-free algorithm for UQ on
gradient flow systems with isotropic diffusion. We numerically verify these
algorithms on a 1-dimensional linear gradient flow system where the analytic
solutions of the UQ problems are known. We also apply the algorithm to a
chaotically forced nonlinear gradient flow system which is known to be well
approximated as a stochastically forced gradient flow.

produced via bremsstrahlung from the 1.5 GeV incident electron beam and
energy-tagged with the Glasgow photon tagger. Decay photons of the neutral
decay modes $\eta\rightarrow 2\gamma$ and $\eta\rightarrow 3\pi^0 \rightarrow

the Crystal Ball and the TAPS calorimeters. The $\eta$-production cross
sections were measured in coincidence with recoil protons, recoil neutrons, and
in an inclusive mode without a condition on recoil nucleons, which allowed a
check of the internal consistency of the data. The effects from nuclear Fermi
motion were removed by a kinematic reconstruction of the final-state invariant
mass and possible nuclear effects on the quasifree cross section were
investigated by a comparison of free and quasifree proton data. The results,
which represent a significant improvement in statistical quality compared to
previous measurements, agree with the known neutron-to-proton cross-section
ratio in the peak of the $S_{11}(1535)$ resonance and confirm a peak in the

However, before this can be practically achieved, a thorough, scientific
understanding of the various spin transport and relaxation processes undergone
in this material is essential. In the present paper we report our
investigations into these processes via temperature dependent, non-local Hanle
experiments. Epitaxial ZnO thin films were deposited on c-axis sapphire
substrates using a pulsed laser deposition technique. Careful structural,
optical, and electrical characterizations of the films were performed.
Temperature dependent Hanle measurements were carried out, using an
all-electrical scheme for spin injection and detection, in a non-local geometry
over the temperature range of 20 - 300 K. Carrier concentration in these films,
as determined by Hall effect measurements, was found to be of the order of
10^19 cm^-3. It was determined that in such a degenerately doped system it is
essential to use Fermi-Dirac statistics to explain the transport of carriers in
the system. From the Hanle data, spin relaxation time in the ZnO films was
determined at different temperatures. Our analysis of the temperature-dependent
spin relaxation time data suggests that the dominant mechanism of spin
relaxation in ZnO films is the Dyakonov-Perel (DP) mechanism modified for the
wurtzite crystalline structure in which a hexagonal c-axis reflection asymmetry
is present. As a result of this modification the spin-relaxation rate is
linear-in-momentum.

map out the structure and evolution of the observable universe to an

gravitational lensing of galaxies, e.g., cosmic shear that measures the minute
distortions of background galaxy images by intervening cosmic structure. Weak
lensing and cosmic shear promise to be a powerful probe of astrophysics and
cosmology, constraining models of dark energy, measuring the evolution of
structure in the universe, and testing theories of gravity on cosmic scales.
However, the intrinsic alignment of galaxies -- their shape and orientation
before being lensed -- may pose a great challenge to the use of weak
gravitational lensing as an accurate cosmological probe, and has been
identified as one of the primary physical systematic biases in cosmic shear
studies. Correlations between this intrinsic alignment and the lensing signal
can persist even for large physical separations, and isolating the effect of
intrinsic alignment from weak lensing is not trivial. A great deal of work in
the last two decades has been devoted to understanding and characterizing this
intrinsic alignment, which is also a direct and complementary probe of
structure formation and evolution in its own right. In this review, we report
in a systematic way the state of our understanding of the intrinsic alignment

bitensors, to use a deviation vector field along a fiducial geodesic to
describe a neighboring worldline, in an exact and manifestly covariant manner,
via the exponential map. Requiring the neighboring worldline to be a geodesic
leads to the usual linear geodesic deviation equation for the deviation vector,
plus corrections at higher order in the deviation and relative velocity. We
show how these corrections can be efficiently computed to arbitrary orders via
covariant bitensor expansions, deriving a form of the geodesic deviation
equation valid to all orders, and producing its explicit expanded form through
fourth order. We also discuss the generalized Jacobi equation, action
principles for the higher-order geodesic deviation equations, results useful
for describing accelerated neighboring worldlines, and the formal general
solution to the geodesic deviation equation through second order.

first time, the existence of polaritons in ionic crystals was proven in a
microscopic electrodynamic theory. This was obtained through an explicit
computation of the dispersion curves. Here the main further contribution
consists in studying electric susceptibility, from which the spectrum can be
inferred. We show how susceptibility is obtained by the Green--Kubo methods of
Hamiltonian statistical mechanics, and give for it a concrete expression in
terms of time--correlation functions. As in the previous paper, here too we
work in a completely classical framework, in which the electrodynamic forces
acting on the charges are all taken into account, both the retarded forces and
the radiation reaction ones. So, in order to apply the methods of statistical
mechanics, the system has to be previously reduced to a Hamiltonian one. This
is made possible in virtue of two global properties of classical
electrodynamics, namely, the Wheeler--Feynman identity and the Ewald
resummation properties, the proofs of which were already given for ordered
system. The second contribution consists in formulating the theory in a
completely general way, so that in principle it applies also to disordered
systems such as glasses, or liquids or gases, provided the two general
properties mentioned above continue to hold. A first step in this direction is
made here by providing a completely general proof of the Wheeler--Feynman
identity, which is shown to be the counterpart of a general causality property
of classical electrodynamics. Finally it is shown how a line spectrum can
appear at all in classical systems, as a counterpart of suitable stability
properties of the motions, with a broadening due to a coexistence of
chaoticity.

stars. We chose a star from each of the bright and faint O-rich AGB populations
found by earlier studies of the SAGE sample in order to derive a baseline set
of dust properties to be used in the construction of an extensive grid of
radiative transfer models of the O-rich AGB stars found in the SAGE surveys.
From the bright O-rich AGB population we chose HV 5715, and from the faint
O-rich AGB population we chose SSTISAGE1C J052206.92-715017.6 (SSTSAGE052206).
We found the complex indices of refraction of oxygen-deficient silicates from
Ossenkopf et al (1992) and a ""KMH""-like grain size distribution with gamma of
-3.5, a_min of 0.01 microns, and a_0 of 0.1 microns to be reasonable dust
properties for these models. There is a slight indication that the dust around
the faint O-rich AGB may be more silica-rich than that around the bright O-rich
AGB. Simple models of gas emission suggest a relatively extended gas envelope
for the faint O-rich AGB star modeled, consistent with the relatively large
dust shell inner radius for the same model. The models compute the dust
mass-loss rates for the two stars to be 2.0x10^-9 M_Sun/yr and 2.3x10^-9
M_Sun/yr, respectively. When a dust-to-gas mass ratio of 0.002 is assumed for
SSTSAGE052206 and HV 5715, the dust mass-loss rates imply total mass-loss rates
of 1.0x10^-6 M_Sun/yr and 1.2x10^-6 M_Sun/yr, respectively. These properties of
the dust shells and stars, as inferred from our models of the two stars, are
found to be consistent with properties observed or assumed by detailed studies
of other O-rich AGB stars in the LMC and elsewhere.

deposition has triggered great interest due to its exciting potential for
applications in advanced electronic and optoelectronic devices. Unlike gapless
graphene, MoS2 has an intrinsic band gap in the visible which crosses over from
an indirect to a direct gap when reduced to a single atomic layer. In this
article, we report a comprehensive study of fundamental optical properties of
MoS2 revealed by optical spectroscopy of Raman, photoluminescence, and vacuum
ultraviolet spectroscopic ellipsometry. A band gap of 1.42 eV is determined by
the absorption threshold of bulk MoS2 that shifts to 1.83 eV in monolayer MoS2.
We extracted the high precision dielectric function up to 9.0 eV which leads to
the identification of many unique interband transitions at high symmetry points
in the MoS2 momentum space. The positions of the A and B excitons in single
layers are found to shift upwards in energy compared with those of the bulk
form and have smaller separation. A very strong optical critical point
predicted to correspond to a quasi-particle gap is observed at 2.86 eV, which
is attributed to optical transitions along the parallel bands between the M and
gama points in the reduced Brillouin zone. The absence of the bulk MoS2
spin-orbit interaction peak at ~ 3.0 eV in monolayer MoS2 is, as predicted, the
consequence of the coalescence of nearby excitons. A higher energy optical
transition at 3.98 eV, commonly occurred in bulk semiconductors, is associated
with a combination of several critical points.These optical transitions herein
reported enhance our understanding of monolayer MoS2 as well as of
two-dimensional systems in general, and thus provide informative guidelines for
MoS2 optical device designs and theoretical considerations.

it to the gravitational force in the radial component of the momentum equation.
We distinguish the different contributions between the large-scale and the
small-scale turbulent fields by Reynolds averaging. We compare these findings
with a dynamical dynamo model. We find a possible reduction of circular gas
velocity in the very outer parts and an increase inside a radius of four times
the synchrotron scale length. Sufficiently localized radial reversals of the
magnetic field may cause characteristic modulations in the gas rotation curve
with typical amplitudes of 10-20 km/s. It is unlikely that the magnetic field
contributes to the flat rotation in the outer parts of galaxies. If anything,
it will \emph{impede} the gravitationally supported rotation, demanding for an
even higher halo mass to explain the observed rotation profile. We speculate
that this may have consequences for ram pressure stripping and the truncation
of the stellar disc.

from the electricity operator and consumer viewpoints. Modern electric power
grids (smart grids) are equipped with smart sensors that allow to gather
real-time information regarding the physical status of all the component
elements belonging to the whole infrastructure (e.g., cables and related
insulation, transformers, breakers and so on). In real-world smart grid
systems, usually, additional information that are related to the operational
status of the grid itself are collected such as meteorological information.
Designing a suitable recognition (discrimination) model of faults in a
real-world smart grid system is hence a challenging task. This follows from the
heterogeneity of the information that actually determine a typical fault
condition. The second point is that, for synthesizing a recognition model, in
practice only the conditions of observed faults are usually meaningful.
Therefore, a suitable recognition model should be synthesized by making use of
the observed fault conditions only. In this paper, we deal with the problem of
modeling and recognizing faults in a real-world smart grid system, which
supplies the entire city of Rome, Italy. Recognition of faults is addressed by
following a combined approach of multiple dissimilarity measures customization
and one-class classification techniques. We provide here an in-depth study

one-class classifier. We offer also a comprehensive analysis of the fault
recognition results by exploiting a fuzzy set based reliability decision rule.

colluding nodes, are analytically assessed. The analysis is applicable to both
linear and nonlinear codes and is simplified in the case of maximum distance
separable codes. It is shown that the multiplicity of codes significantly
enhances the security and connectivity of KPS at the cost of a modest increase
of the nodes storage. Numerical and simulation results are provided, which
sheds light on the effect of system parameters of the proposed KPS on its
complexity and performance. Specifically, it is shown that the probability of
resilience of secure pairs against collusion of other nodes only reduces slowly
as the number of colluding nodes increase.

global field $K$ on a tree $T(\phi, \alpha)$ of iterated preimages of $\alpha
\in \mathbb{P}^1(K)$ under $\phi \in K(x)$ with $\text{deg}(\phi) \geq 2$
induces a homomorphism $\rho: \text{Gal}(K^{\text{ksep}}/K) \to
\text{Aut}(T(\phi, \alpha))$, which is called an arboreal Galois
representation. In this paper, we address a number of questions posed by Jones
and Manes about the size of the group $G(\phi,\alpha) := \text{im} \rho =
\underset{\leftarrow n}\lim\text{Gal}(K(\phi^{-n}(\alpha))/K)$. Specifically,
we consider two cases for the pair $(\phi, \alpha)$: (1) $\phi$ is such that
the sequence $\{a_n\}$ defined by $a_0 = \alpha$ and $a_n = \phi(a_{n-1})$ is
periodic, and (2) $\phi$ commutes with a nontrivial Mobius transformation that
fixes $\alpha$.
  In the first case, we resolve a question posed by Jones about the size of
$G(\phi, \alpha)$, and taking $K = \mathbb{Q}$, we describe the Galois groups
of iterates of polynomials $\phi \in \mathbb{Z}[x]$ that have the form $\phi(x)
= x^2 + kx$ or $\phi(x) = x^2 - (k+1)x + k$. When $K = \mathbb{Q}$ and $\phi
\in \mathbb{Z}[x]$, arboreal Galois representations are a useful tool for
studying the arithmetic dynamics of $\phi$. In the case of $\phi(x) = x^2 + kx$
for $k \in \mathbb{Z}$, we employ a result of Jones regarding the size of the
group $G(\psi, 0)$, where $\psi(x) = x^2 - kx + k$, to obtain a zero-density
result for primes dividing terms of the sequence $\{a_n\}$ defined by $a_0 \in
\mathbb{Z}$ and $a_n = \phi(a_{n-1})$.
  In the second case, we resolve a conjecture of Jones about the size of a
certain subgroup $C(\phi, \alpha) \subset \text{Aut}(T(\phi, \alpha))$ that
contains $G(\phi, \alpha)$, and we present progress toward the proof of a
conjecture of Jones and Manes concerning the size of $G(\phi, \alpha)$ as a
subgroup of $C(\phi, \alpha)$.

formed in the Kuiper Belt - among these two populations. Here, we report
spectroscopic observations in the visible and/or near-infrared spectral ranges
of twelve high-albedo (p$_{\rm v}$ > 0.15) Hilda asteroids and Jupiter Trojans.
These twelve objects have spectral properties similar to those of the low-
albedo population, which suggests a similar composition and hence a similar
origin for low- and high-albedo Hilda asteroids and Jupiter Trojans. We
therefore propose that most high albedos probably result from statistical bias
or uncertainties that affect the WISE and SST measurements. However, some of
the high albedos may be true and the outcome of some collision-induced
resurfacing by a brighter material that could include water ice. Future work
should attempt to investigate the nature of this supposedly bright material.
The lack of interlopers in our sample allows us to set an upper limit of 0.4%
at a confidence level of 99.7% on the abundance of interlopers with unexpected
taxonomic classes (e.g., A-, S-, V-type asteroids) among these two populations.

these two collider observables at the LHC and ILC in the 19/20-parameter

will potentially null direct searches for SUSY at the LHC influence the
predicted properties of the lightest SUSY Higgs boson? (ii) What can be learned
about the properties of the superpartners from precision measurements of the
Higgs boson couplings? In this paper, we examine these questions by employing
three different large sets of pMSSM models with either the neutralino or
gravitino being the LSP. We make use of the ATLAS direct SUSY searches at the
7/8 TeV LHC as well as expected results from 14 TeV operations, and the
anticipated precision measurements of the Higgs Boson couplings at the 14 TeV
LHC and at the ILC. We demonstrate that the future Higgs coupling
determinations can deeply probe the pMSSM parameter space and, in particular,
can observe the effects of models that are projected to evade the direct
searches at the 14 TeV LHC with 3 inverse ab of integrated luminosity. In
addition, we compare the reach of the Higgs coupling determinations to the
direct heavy Higgs searches in the MA - tan beta plane and show that they cover

The observed relation and scatter is consistent with a continued increase in
star formation rate at fixed mass in line with extrapolations from
lower-redshift observations. It is difficult to explain this continued
correlation, especially for the most massive systems, unless the most massive
galaxies are forming stars near their Eddington-limited rate from their first

formation process. Through numerical simulation and basic observational
constraints, the basics of planet formation are now coming into focus. High
resolution imaging at a range of wavelengths will give us a glimpse into the
past of our own solar system and enable a robust theoretical framework for
predicting planetary system architectures around a range of stars surrounded by
disks with a diversity of initial conditions. Only long-baseline interferometry
can provide the needed angular resolution and wavelength coverage to reach
these goals and from here we launch our planning efforts. The aim of the
""Planet Formation Imager"" (PFI) project is to develop the roadmap for the
construction of a new near-/mid-infrared interferometric facility that will be
optimized to unmask all the major stages of planet formation, from initial dust
coagulation, gap formation, evolution of transition disks, mass accretion onto
planetary embryos, and eventual disk dispersal. PFI will be able to detect the
emission of the cooling, newly-formed planets themselves over the first 100
Myrs, opening up both spectral investigations and also providing a vibrant look
into the early dynamical histories of planetary architectures. Here we
introduce the Planet Formation Imager (PFI) Project
(www.planetformationimager.org) and give initial thoughts on possible facility
architectures and technical advances that will be needed to meet the
challenging top-level science requirements.

astrophysics are the means by which planetary systems are assembled from the
large rotating disks of gas and dust which attend a stellar birth. Although
important work has already been, and is still being done both in theory and
observation, a full understanding of the physics of planet formation can only
be achieved by opening observational windows able to directly witness the
process in action. The key requirement is then to probe planet-forming systems
at the natural spatial scales over which material is being assembled. By
definition, this is the so-called Hill Sphere which delineates the region of
influence of a gravitating body within its surrounding environment. The Planet
Formation Imager project (PFI) has crystallized around this challenging goal:
to deliver resolved images of Hill-Sphere-sized structures within candidate
planet-hosting disks in the nearest star-forming regions. In this contribution
we outline the primary science case of PFI. For this purpose, we briefly review
our knowledge about the planet-formation process and discuss recent
observational results that have been obtained on the class of transition disks.
Spectro-photometric and multi-wavelength interferometric studies of these
systems revealed the presence of extended gaps and complex density
inhomogeneities that might be triggered by orbiting planets. We present
detailed 3-D radiation-hydrodynamic simulations of disks with single and
multiple embedded planets, from which we compute synthetic images at
near-infrared, mid-infrared, far-infrared, and sub-millimeter wavelengths,
enabling a direct comparison of the signatures that are detectable with PFI and
complementary facilities such as ALMA. From these simulations, we derive some
preliminary specifications that will guide the array design and technology
roadmap of the facility.

scalar hair, sourced either by the star's own compactness (spontaneous
scalarization) or, for binary systems, by the companion's scalar hair (induced
scalarization) or by the orbital binding energy (dynamical scalarization).
Scalarized stars in binaries present different conservative dynamics than in
General Relativity, and can also excite a scalar mode in the metric
perturbation that carries away dipolar radiation. As a result, the binary orbit
shrinks faster than predicted in General Relativity, modifying the rate of
decay of the orbital period. In spite of this, scalar-tensor theories can pass
existing binary pulsar tests, because observed pulsars may not be compact
enough or sufficiently orbitally bound to activate scalarization. Gravitational
waves emitted during the last stages of compact binary inspirals are thus ideal
probes of scalarization effects. For the standard projected sensitivity of
advanced LIGO, we here show that, if neutron stars are sufficiently compact to
enter the detector's sensitivity band already scalarized, then gravitational
waves could place constraints at least comparable to binary pulsars. If the
stars dynamically scalarize while inspiraling in band, then constraints are
still possible provided the scalarization occurs sufficiently early in the
inspiral, roughly below an orbital frequency of 50Hz. In performing these
studies, we derive an easy-to-calculate data analysis measure, an integrated
phase difference between a General Relativistic and a modified signal, that
maps directly to the Bayes factor so as to determine whether a modified gravity
effect is detectable. Finally, we find that custom-made templates are equally
effective as model-independent, parameterized post-Einsteinian waveforms at
detecting such modified gravity effects at realistic signal-to-noise ratios.

supernovae. These calculations include key hydrodynamic mixing processes not
present in standard semi-analytic chemical evolution models, such as galactic
winds and hydrodynamic flows associated with structure formation. We explore a
range of models for the rate and delay time of NS mergers, intended to roughly
bracket the wide range of models consistent with current observational
constraints. We show that NS mergers can produce [r-process/Fe] abundance
ratios and scatter that appear reasonably consistent with observational
constraints. At low metallicity, [Fe/H]<-2, we predict there is a wide range of
stellar r-process abundance ratios, with both supersolar and subsolar
abundances. Low-metallicity stars or stars that are outliers in their r-process
abundance ratios are, on average, formed at high redshift and located at large
galactocentric radius. Because NS mergers are rare, our results are not fully
converged with respect to resolution, particularly at low metallicity. However,
the uncertain rate and delay time distribution of NS mergers introduces an
uncertainty in the r-process abundances comparable to that due to finite
numerical resolution. Overall, our results are consistent with NS mergers being
the source of most of the r-process nuclei in the Universe.

simulations that follow the formation of galaxies and black holes in

of their finite resolution and poorly constrained subgrid physics, and how
these affect their predictive power. One major improvement is our treatment of
feedback from massive stars and AGN in which thermal energy is injected into
the gas without the need to turn off cooling or hydrodynamical forces, allowing
winds to develop without predetermined speed or mass loading factors. Because
the feedback efficiencies cannot be predicted from first principles, we
calibrate them to the z~0 galaxy stellar mass function and the amplitude of the
galaxy-central black hole mass relation, also taking galaxy sizes into account.
The observed galaxy mass function is reproduced to $\lesssim 0.2$ dex over the
full mass range, $10^8 < M_*/M_\odot \lesssim 10^{11}$, a level of agreement
close to that attained by semi-analytic models, and unprecedented for
hydrodynamical simulations. We compare our results to a representative set of
low-redshift observables not considered in the calibration, and find good
agreement with the observed galaxy specific star formation rates, passive
fractions, Tully-Fisher relation, total stellar luminosities of galaxy
clusters, and column density distributions of intergalactic CIV and OVI. While
the mass-metallicity relations for gas and stars are consistent with
observations for $M_* \gtrsim 10^9 M_\odot$, they are insufficiently steep at
lower masses. The gas fractions and temperatures are too high for clusters of
galaxies, but for groups these discrepancies can be resolved by adopting a
higher heating temperature in the subgrid prescription for AGN feedback. EAGLE
constitutes a valuable new resource for studies of galaxy formation.

asymmetric ring of gas and dust beyond \about 100 AU and a wide inner gap.
Within the gap, a low-mass stellar companion orbits the primary star at just
\about 12 AU, and both the primary and secondary are accreting gas. In an
attempt to directly detect the dusty counterpart to this accreted gas, we have
observed HD 142527 with the Gemini Planet Imager in polarized light at $Y$ band
(0.95-1.14 \microns). We clearly detect the companion in total intensity and
show that its position and photometry are generally consistent with the
expected values. We also detect a point-source in polarized light that may be
spatially separated by \about a few AU from the location of the companion in
total intensity. This suggests that dust is likely falling onto or orbiting the
companion. Given the possible contribution of scattered light from this dust to
previously reported photometry of the companion, the current mass limits should
be viewed as upper limits only. If the dust near the companion is eventually
confirmed to be spatially separated, this system would resemble a scaled-up
version of the young planetary system inside the gap of the transition disk

mass donor, the predicted eclipse half-angle was calculated as a function of
inclination angle for several stellar spectral types. The eclipse half-angle is
not consistent with a mass donor of spectral type B5 V; however, stars with
spectral types B0 V or B0-5 III are possible. The best-fit spectral model
consists of a power law with index gamma = 1.85 (+0.04,-0.05) and a high-energy
cutoff at 5.5 +/- 0.2 keV modified by an absorber that fully covers the source
as well as partially covering absorption. Emission lines from S XVI K alpha, Fe
K alpha, Fe XXV K alpha and Fe XXVI K alpha were observed in the Suzaku
spectra. Out-of-eclipse, Fe K alpha line flux was strongly correlated with
unabsorbed continuum flux, indicating that the Fe I emission is the result of
fluorescence of cold dense material near the compact object. The Fe I feature
is not detected during eclipse, further supporting an origin close to the

The first, static ensemble, is obtained foliating an unbiased ensemble of

useful convex function. The second, dynamic ensemble, is inspired in random
matrix models for decoherence where one evolves a separable pure state with a
random Hamiltonian until a given value of purity in the central system is
achieved. Several families of Hamiltonians, adequate for different physical
situations, are studied. We focus on a two qubit central system, and obtain
exact expressions for the static case. The ensemble displays a peak around
Werner-like states, modulated by nodes on the degeneracies of the density
matrices. For moderate and strong interactions good agreement between the
static and the dynamic ensembles is found. Even in a model where one qubit does
not interact with the environment excellent agreement is found, but only if
there is maximal entanglement with the interacting one. The discussion is
started recalling similar considerations for scattering theory. At the end, we
comment on the reach of the results for other convex functions of the density
matrix, and exemplify the situation with the von Neumann entropy.

  State-Space-Collapse Inducing Control with Chattering",,,,,"math.PR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Routing mechanisms for stochastic networks are often designed to produce
state space collapse (SSC) in a heavy-traffic limit, i.e., to confine the
limiting process to a lower-dimensional subset of its full state space. In a
fluid limit, a control producing asymptotic SSC corresponds to an ideal sliding
mode control that forces the fluid trajectories to a lower-dimensional sliding
manifold. Within deterministic dynamical systems theory, it is well known that
sliding-mode controls can cause the system to chatter back and forth along the
sliding manifold due to delays in activation of the control. For the prelimit
stochastic system, chattering implies fluid-scaled fluctuations that are larger
than typical stochastic fluctuations. In this paper we show that chattering can
occur in the fluid limit of a controlled stochastic network when inappropriate
control parameters are used. The model has two large service pools operating
under the fixed-queue-ratio with activation and release thresholds (FQR-ART)
overload control which we proposed in a recent paper. We now show that, if the
control parameters are not chosen properly, then delays in activating and
releasing the control can cause chattering with large oscillations in the fluid
limit. In turn, these fluid-scaled fluctuations lead to severe congestion, even
when the arrival rates are smaller than the potential total service rate in the
system, a phenomenon referred to as congestion collapse. We show that the fluid
limit can be a bi-stable switching system possessing a unique nontrivial
periodic equilibrium, in addition to a unique stationary point.

on the presence in the transmitter of a particular type of quantum
correlations, the discord of response. Different encodings and transmitters
give rise to different levels of efficiency. Considering noisy quantum probes
we show that squeezed thermal transmitters with non-symmetrically distributed
noise among the field modes yield a higher quantum efficiency compared to
coherent thermal quantum states. The noise-enhanced quantum advantage is a
consequence of the discord of response being a non-decreasing function of
increasing thermal noise under constant squeezing, a behavior that leads to an
increased state distinguishability. We finally show that, for non-symmetric
squeezed thermal states, the probability of error, as measured by the quantum
Chernoff bound, vanishes asymptotically with increasing local thermal noise at
finite global squeezing. Therefore, at fixed finite squeezing, noisy but
strongly discordant quantum states with large noise imbalance between the field
modes can outperform noisy classical resources as well as pure entangled
transmitters with the same finite level of squeezing.

rapid growth of RNA transcripts, computational prediction of RNA tertiary
structure remains highly demanded yet significantly challenging. Even for a
short RNA sequence, the space of tertiary conformations is immense; existing
methods to identify native-like conformations mostly resort to random sampling
of conformations to gain computational feasibility. However native
conformations may not be examined and prediction accuracy may be compromised
due to sampling. In particular, the state-of-the-art methods have yet to
deliver the desired prediction performance for RNAs of length beyond 50.
  This paper presents the work to tackle a key step in the RNA tertiary
structure prediction problem, the prediction of the nucleotide interactions
that constitute the desired tertiary structure. The research is established
upon a novel graph model, called backbone k-tree, to markably constrain
nucleotide interaction relationships in RNA tertiary structure. It is shown
that the new model makes it possible to efficiently predict the optimal set of
nucleotide interactions from the query sequence, including the interactions in
all recently revealed families. Evident by the preliminary results, the new
method can predict with a high accuracy the nucleotide interactions that
constitute the tertiary structure of the query sequence, thus providing a
viable solution towards ab initio prediction of RNA tertiary structure.

rotating magnetic field generated by a microwave is theoretically studied based
on the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation. In a rotating frame, the microwave
produces a dc magnetic field pointing in the reversed direction, which
energetically stabilizes the reversed state. We find that the microwave
simultaneously produces a torque preventing the reversal. It is pointed out
that this torque leads to a jump in the reversal field with respect to the
frequency. We derive the equations determining the reversal fields in both the
low- and high-frequency regions from the energy balance equation. The
validities of the formulas are confirmed by a comparison with the numerical
simulation of the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation.

regime we are able to determine the front speed via a marginal stability
analysis. We find that the density modulations generated behind the advancing
front have a characteristic scale that differs from the wavelength of the
density modulation in thermodynamic equilibrium, i.e., the spacing between the
crystal planes in an equilibrium crystal. This leads to the subsequent
development of disorder in the solids that are formed. For the one-component

few defects. However, solidification fronts in a binary mixture exhibiting

the cooperation information from the relay is encoded via SW source coding. It
is shown that there are cases in which the new scheme strictly outperforms the

three different sets of single-letter necessary conditions for reliable
transmission of correlated sources over DM MARCs. The newly derived conditions
are shown to be at least as tight as the previously known necessary conditions.

computed in three free field theories in 4 dimensions; the result is given for
two of the three operators on the mass-shell. In chapter 3 a general method to
map Green functions built in position space on the ground of symmetry
requirements to momentum space, where they can be computed in terms of Feynman

decide whether a certain correlator can exist within a Lagrangian theory, is

parameter space that permits Turing patterns to emerge makes it difficult to
explain how Turing patterns could evolve. We have recently shown that Turing
patterns can be obtained with a single ligand if the ligand-receptor
interaction is taken into account. Here we show that the general properties of
ligand-receptor systems result in very large Turing spaces. Thus, the
restriction of receptors to single cells, negative feedbacks, regulatory
interactions between different ligand-receptor systems, and the clustering of
receptors on the cell surface all greatly enlarge the Turing space. We further
show that the feedbacks that occur in the FGF10/SHH network that controls lung
branching morphogenesis are sufficient to result in large Turing spaces. We
conclude that the cellular restriction of receptors provides a mechanism to
sufficiently increase the size of the Turing space to make the evolution of
Turing patterns likely. Additional feedbacks may then have further enlarged the
Turing space. Given their robustness and flexibility, we propose that
receptor-ligand based Turing mechanisms present a general mechanism for
patterning in biology.

the impact of the critical density which governs the transition from isothermal
to adiabatic thermodynamic behaviour of the collapsing gas. We find that the
critical density not only affects the overall structural evolution of the gas
envelope, but also the size of the rotating disk structures formed during
collapse as well as the number of protostellar fragments resulting from the
final fragmentation of the disks. This mechanism can give rise to young
protostellar objects constituting bound multiple stellar systems.

  Algorithm",,,,,"stat.AP stat.ME","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We introduce the Hawkes process with renewal immigration and make its
statistical estimation possible with two Expectation Maximization (EM)
algorithms. The standard Hawkes process introduces immigrant points via a
Poisson process, and each immigrant has a subsequent cluster of associated
offspring of multiple generations. We generalize the immigration to come from a
Renewal process; introducing dependence between neighbouring clusters, and
allowing for over/under dispersion in cluster locations. This complicates
evaluation of the likelihood since one needs to know which subset of the
observed points are immigrants. Two EM algorithms enable estimation here: The
first is an extension of an existing algorithm that treats the entire branching
structure - which points are immigrants, and which point is the parent of each
offspring - as missing data. The second considers only if a point is an
immigrant or not as missing data and can be implemented with linear time
complexity. Both algorithms are found to be consistent in simulation studies.
Further, we show that misspecifying the immigration process introduces
signficant bias into model estimation-- especially the branching ratio, which
quantifies the strength of self excitation. Thus, this extended model provides
a valuable alternative model in practice.

following open problems:

to the other dark energy probes, since they are extremely helpful in breaking
the existing parameter degeneracies. We show that the strong degeneracy between
$\Omega_m$ and $H_0$ in all the three dark energy models is well broken by the
SL test. Compared to the current combined data of type Ia supernovae, baryon
acoustic oscillation, cosmic microwave background, and Hubble constant, the
30-yr observation of SL test could improve the constraints on $\Omega_m$ and
$H_0$ by more than 60\% for all the three models. But the SL test can only
moderately improve the constraint on the equation of state of dark energy. We
show that a 30-yr observation of SL test could help improve the constraint on
constant $w$ by about 25\%, and improve the constraints on $w_0$ and $w_a$ by
about 20\% and 15\%, respectively. We also quantify the constraining power of
the SL test in the future high-precision joint geometric constraints on dark

evolution of slow plasma perturbations propagating outward in the form of
plasma flows. We conclude that the heating, which may result from magnetic

extant species (taxa), and the internal vertices represent ancestral species.
The evolutionary history of a set of species can be explained by more than one
phylogenetic tree, giving rise to the problem of comparing phylogenetic trees
for similarity. Various distance metrics, like the subtree prune-and-regraft
(SPR), tree bisection reconnection (TBR) and nearest neighbour interchange
(NNI) have been proposed to capture this similarity. The distance between two
phylogenetic trees can also be measured by the size of a Maximum Agreement
Forest (MAF) on these trees, as it has been shown that the rooted subtree
prune-and-regraft distance is 1 less than the size of a MAF. Since computing a
MAF of minimum size is an NP-hard problem, approximation algorithms are of
interest. Recently, it has been shown that the MAF on k(>=2) trees can be
approximated to within a factor of 8. In this paper, we improve this ratio to
3. For certain species, however, the evolutionary history is not completely
tree-like. Due to reticulate evolution two gene trees, though related, appear
different, making a phylogenetic network a more appropriate representation of
reticulate evolution. A phylogenetic network contains hybrid nodes for the
species evolved from two parents. The number of such nodes is its hybridization
number. It has been shown that this number is 1 less than the size of a Maximum
Acyclic Agreement Forest (MAAF). We show that the MAAF for k(>= 2) phylogenetic
trees can be approximated to within a factor of 3.

high-resolution cosmological simulations. The AM originates in co-planar
streams of cold gas and merging galaxies tracing cosmic-web filaments, and it
undergoes four phases of evolution. (I) Outside the halo virial radius ($R_{\rm
v}\!\sim\!100\,{\rm kpc}$), the elongated streams gain AM by tidal torques with
a specific AM (sAM) $\sim\!1.7$ times the dark-matter (DM) spin due to the gas'
higher quadrupole moment. This AM is expressed as stream impact parameters,
from $\sim\!0.3R_{\rm v}$ to counter rotation. (II) In the outer halo, while
the incoming DM mixes with the existing halo of lower sAM to a spin
$\lambda_{\rm dm}\!\sim\!0.04$, the cold streams transport the AM to the inner
halo such that their spin in the halo is $\sim\!3\lambda_{\rm dm}$. (III) Near
pericenter, the streams dissipate into an irregular rotating ring extending to
$\sim\!0.3R_{\rm v}$ and tilted relative to the inner disc. Torques exerted
partly by the disc make the ring gas lose AM, spiral in, and settle into the
disc within one orbit. The ring is observable with 30\% probability as a damped
Lyman-$\alpha$ absorber. (IV) Within the disc, $<\!0.1R_{\rm v}$, torques
associated with violent disc instability drive AM out and baryons into a
central bulge, while outflows remove low-spin gas, introducing certain
sensitivity to feedback strength. Despite the different AM histories of gas and
DM, the disc spin is comparable to the DM-halo spin. Counter rotation can
strongly affect disc evolution.

protection of their primary services. From an incumbent perspective, the
spectrum sharing approach needs to be non-harmful as well as efficient. In
order to make spectrum sharing efficient, it is necessary to maximize the
spectrum available for secondary access as well as maximize its exploitation.
We examine the impact of the conservative assumptions that lead to lesser
availability of spectrum for secondary access. The problem of joint scheduling
and spectrum-access footprint allocation is at the heart of maximizing the
exploitation. This problem is NP-hard and we present a suboptimal approach
based on the minimal spectrum consumption cost of a spectrum-access request. In
order to improve the spectrum sharing potential, we investigate the impact of
the various design choices for a spectrum access mechanism. The experiments
demonstrate the significance of the active role of the incumbents, the benefits
of fine granular spectrum access, and the need for transceiver standards for
accomplishing efficient usage of the spectrum.

Latham","Zipf's law arises naturally in structured, high-dimensional data",,,,,"q-bio.NC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Zipf's law, which states that the probability of an observation is inversely
proportional to its rank, has been observed in many domains. While there are
models that explain Zipf's law in each of them, those explanations are
typically domain specific. Recently, methods from statistical physics were used
to show that a fairly broad class of models does provide a general explanation
of Zipf's law. This explanation rests on the observation that real world data
is often generated from underlying causes, known as latent variables. Those
latent variables mix together multiple models that do not obey Zipf's law,
giving a model that does. Here we extend that work both theoretically and
empirically. Theoretically, we provide a far simpler and more intuitive
explanation of Zipf's law, which at the same time considerably extends the
class of models to which this explanation can apply. Furthermore, we also give
methods for verifying whether this explanation applies to a particular dataset.
Empirically, these advances allowed us extend this explanation to important
classes of data, including word frequencies (the first domain in which Zipf's
law was discovered), data with variable sequence length, and multi-neuron
spiking activity.

reflexive intransitive time relation. The logic is defined semantically, -- as
the set of formulas which are true at special frames with intransitive and
reflexive time binary relation. The LTK_r -frames are linear chains of clusters
connected by a reflexive intransitive relation $R_T$. Elements inside a cluster
are connected by several equivalence relations imitating the knowledge of
different agents. We study the decidability problem for formulas and inference
rules. Decidability for formulas follows from decidability w.r.t. admissible
inference rules.To study admissibility, we introduce some special constructive
Kripke models useful for description of admissibility of inference rules. With
a special technique of definable valuations we find an algorithm determining
admissible inference rules in LTK_r. That is, we show that the logic LTK_r is
decidable and decidable with respect to admissibility of inference rules.

features. We demonstrate that the zero phonon line position can be used to
reliably identify the silicon isotope present in a single centre. This is of
interest for quantum information applications since only the silicon 29 isotope
has nuclear spin. In addition, we demonstrate that the 64 meV line is due to a
local vibrational mode of the silicon atom. The presence of a local mode
suggests a plausible origin of the isotopic shift of the zero phonon line.

fuel cell catalyst layers has significant impact on the electrochemical

regions, Nafion can be found as an ultra-thin film, coating the catalyst and
the catalyst support surfaces. The impact of the hydrophilic/hydrophobic
character of these surfaces on the structural formation of the films has not
been sufficiently explored yet. Here, we report about Molecular Dynamics
simulation investigation of the substrate effects on the ionomer ultra-thin
film morphology at different hydration levels. We use a mean-field-like model
we introduced in previous publications for the interaction of the hydrated
Nafion ionomer with a substrate, characterized by a tunable degree of
hydrophilicity. We show that the affinity of the substrate with water plays a
crucial role in the molecular rearrangement of the ionomer film, resulting in
completely different morphologies. Detailed structural description in different
regions of the film shows evidences of strongly heterogeneous behavior. A
qualitative discussion of the implications of our observations on the PEMFC
catalyst layer performance is finally proposed.

enhance the onset of first order synchronization. The star network also

delay. An analytical prediction to observe the effect of the time delay is
provided and further supported by simulation results. Our findings may help
provide valuable insights into the understanding of mechanisms that lead to
