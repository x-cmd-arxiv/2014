(AE Aqr) is a very-high-energy (VHE, $E>$100 GeV) source both on observational
and theoretical grounds. We aim to search for VHE gamma-ray emission from AE
Aqr during different states of the source at several wavelengths to confirm or
rule out previous claims of detection of gamma-ray emission from this object.
We report on observations of AE Aqr performed by MAGIC. The source was observed
during 12 hours as part of a multiwavelength campaign carried out between May
and June 2012 covering the optical, X-ray, and gamma-ray ranges. Besides MAGIC,
the other facilities involved were the KVA, Skinakas, and Vidojevica telescopes
in the optical and Swift in X-rays. We calculated integral upper limits
coincident with different states of the source in the optical. We computed
upper limits to the pulsed emission limiting the signal region to 30% of the
phaseogram and we also searched for pulsed emission at different frequencies
applying the Rayleigh test. AE Aqr was not detected at VHE energies during the
multiwavelength campaign. We establish integral upper limits at the 95\%
confidence level for the steady emission assuming the differential flux
proportional to a power-law function d\phi/dE \propto E^{-Gamma}, with a
Crab-like photon spectral index of Gamma=2.6. The upper limit above 200 GeV is
6.4\times10^{-12} cm^{-2}s^{-1} and above 1 TeV is 7.4\times10^{-13}
cm^{-2}s^{-1}. We obtained an upper limit for the pulsed emission of
2.6\times10^{-12} cm^{-2}s^{-1} for energies above 200 GeV. Applying the
Rayleigh test for pulsed emission at different frequencies we did not find any
significant signal. Our results indicate that AE Aqr is not a VHE gamma-ray
emitter at the level of emission previously claimed. We have established the
most constraining upper limits for the VHE gamma-ray emission of AE Aqr.

particles. As the number density is increased at zero temperature, a `cascade'
of isostructural phase transitions can occur between states whose site
occupancy differs by unity. For low but finite temperature, each of these
transitions terminates in a critical point. Using tailored Monte Carlo
simulation techniques we have studied such demixing cascades in systems of soft
particles interacting via potentials of the generalized exponential form
$u(r)=\epsilon\exp[-(r/\sigma)^n]$. We have estimated the critical parameters
of the first few transitions in the cascade as a function of the softness
parameter $n$. The critical temperature and pressure exhibit non-monotonic
behaviour as $n$ is varied, although the critical chemical potential remains
monotonic. The trends for the pressure and chemical potential are confirmed by
cell model calculations at zero temperature. As $n\to 2^+$, all the transitions
that we have observed are preempted by melting although we cannot rule out that
clustering transitions survive at high density.

vortex entry to the hot spot located near the edge of the film. We find that
weak magnetic field strongly affects IDE when the photon detection is connected

when the photon detection is connected with the current induced vortex entry to
the hot spot or nucleation of the vortex-antivortex pair inside the hot spot

angular momentum to the larger body, which may affect its orbit and its

System can have an effect on small asteroids that is comparable to the
Yarkovsky and Yarkovsky-O'Keefe-Radzievskii-Paddack (YORP) effects under
certain conditions.
  The momentum content of the meteoroids themselves is expected to generate an
effect much smaller than that of the Yarkovsky effect. However, momentum
transport by ejecta may increase the net effective force by two orders of
magnitude for impacts into bare rock surfaces. This result is sensitive to the
extrapolation of laboratory microcratering experiment results to real
meteoroid-asteroid collisions and needs further study. If this extrapolation
holds, then meteoroid impacts are more important to the dynamics of small
asteroids than had previously been considered.

In the collinear perturbative scattering picture, twist-3 multi-parton

can also give rise to a spin-dependent distribution of its hadron fragments via
the higher twist effects or the Collins fragmentation function. The observed
$A_N$ may involve contributions from both processes. These can be disentangled

The bismuth ferrite core is sandwiched between metal plates
(metal-insulator-metal configuration), which also serve as electrodes so that
the core changes its refractive index under applied voltage by means of partial
in-plane to out-of-plane reorientation of ferroelectric domains in bismuth
ferrite. This domain switch results in changing of propagation constant and
absorption coefficient, and thus either phase or amplitude control can be
implemented. Efficient modulation performance is achieved because of high field
confinement between the metal layers, as well as the existence of mode cut-offs
for particular values of the core thickness, making it possible to control the
signal with superior modulation depth. For the phase control scheme, {\pi}
phase shift is provided by 0.8-{\mu}m length device having propagation losses
0.29 dB/{\mu}m. For the amplitude control, we predict up to 38 dB/{\mu}m
extinction ratio with 1.2 dB/{\mu}m propagation loss. In contrast to previously
proposed active materials, bismuth ferrite has nearly zero material losses, so
bismuth ferrite based modulators do not bring about additional decay of the
propagating signal.

Experiments in a Hele-Shaw cell, filled with quartz sand, were conducted to
study bacterial growth in the capillary fringe above a saturated porous medium.
Cell density profiles in the Hele-Shaw cell were predicted with the growth

maximum precision that could be achieved on the joint simultaneous (or 2D)
estimation of photometry and astrometry of a point source measured by a linear
CCD detector array. We develop exact expressions for the Fisher matrix elements
required to compute the Cramer-Rao bound in the case of a source with a
Gaussian light profile. From these expressions we predict the behavior of the
Cramer-Rao astrometric and photometric precision as a function of the signal
and the noise of the observations, and compare them to actual observations -
finding a good correspondence between them.
  We show that the astrometric Cramer-Rao bound goes as $(S/N)^{-1}$ (similar
to the photometric bound) but, additionally, we find that this bound is quite
sensitive to the value of the background - suppressing the background can
greatly enhance the astrometric accuracy.
  We present a systematic analysis of the elements of the Fisher matrix in the
case when the detector adequately samples the source (oversampling regime),
leading to closed-form analytical expressions for the Cramer-Rao bound. We show
that, in this regime, the joint parametric determination of photometry and
astrometry for the source become decoupled from each other, and furthermore, it
is possible to write down expressions (approximate to first order in the small
quantities F/B or B/F) for the expected minimum uncertainty in flux and
position. These expressions are shown to be quite resilient to the oversampling
condition, and become thus very valuable benchmark tools to estimate the
approximate behavior of the maximum photometric and astrometric precision

the orthogonal group (respectively the symplectic group), the trivial
representation appears with multiplicity one if and only if all parts of
$\lambda$ are even (resp. the conjugate partition $\lambda'$ is even). One can
rephrase this statement as an integral identity involving Schur functions, the
corresponding characters. Rains and Vazirani considered $q,t$-generalizations
of such integral identities, and proved them using affine Hecke algebra
techniques. In a recent paper, we investigated the $q=0$ limit
(Hall-Littlewood), and provided direct combinatorial arguments for these
identities; this approach led to various generalizations and a
finite-dimensional analog of a recent summation identity of Warnaar. In this
paper, we reformulate some of these results using $p$-adic representation
theory; this parallels the representation-theoretic interpretation in the Schur
case. The nonzero values of the identities are interpreted as certain $p$-adic
measure counts. This approach provides a $p$-adic interpretation of these
identities (and a new identity), as well as independent proofs. As an
application, we obtain a new Littlewood summation identity that generalizes a
classical result due to Littlewood and Macdonald. Finally, our $p$-adic method
also leads to a generalized integral identity in terms of Littlewood-Richardson
coefficients and Hall polynomials.

In this letter, we systematically study the phonon transport and thermal
conductivity of eight semiconducting single-layer TMDCs, MX2 (M=Mo, W, Zr and
Hf, X=S and Se), by using the first-principles-driven phonon Boltzmann
transport equation approach. The validity of the single-mode relaxation time
approximation to predict the thermal conductivity of TMDCs is assessed by
comparing the results with the iterative solution of the phonon Boltzmann
transport equation. We find that the phononic thermal conductivities of 2H-type
TMDCs are above 50 W/mK at room temperature while the thermal conductivity
values of the 1T-type TMDCs are much lower, when the size of the sample is 1
{\mu}m. A very high thermal conductivity value of 142 W/mK was found in
single-layer WS2. The large atomic weight difference between W and S leads to a
very large phonon bandgap which in turn forbids the scattering between acoustic
and optical phonon modes and thus resulting in very long phonon relaxation
time.

compressible, isentropic, isothermal Navier-Stokes system in a bounded domain
$\Omega$ in $\mathbb{R}^d$, $d = 2$ or $3$, for the density, the velocity and
the pressure of the fluid. The right-hand side of the Navier-Stokes momentum
equation includes an elastic extra-stress tensor, which is the sum of the
classical Kramers expression and a quadratic interaction term. The elastic
extra-stress tensor stems from the random movement of the polymer chains and is
defined through the associated probability density function that satisfies a
Fokker-Planck-type parabolic equation, a crucial feature of which is the
presence of a centre-of-mass diffusion term. We require no structural

prove, via a limiting procedure on certain discretization and regularization

entropy optimal (i.e. it reads a minimal number of random bits as an input).
  The algorithm encompasses previous growth procedures for special Schur

domino shuffling algorithm for domino tilings of the Aztec diamond. It can be
easily adapted to deal with symmetric Schur processes and general Schur
processes involving infinitely many parameters. It is more concrete and easier
to implement than Borodin's algorithm, and it is entropy optimal.
  At a technical level, it relies on unified bijective proofs of the different
types of Cauchy and Littlewood identities for Schur functions, and on an
adaptation of Fomin's growth diagram description of the RSK algorithm to that

$\kappa$-superuniversal whenever for every metric space $Y$ with $|Y| < \kappa$
every partial isometry from a subset of $Y$ into $X$ can be extended over the
whole space $Y$. Examples of such spaces were given by Hechler [1] and
Kat\v{e}tov [2]. In particular, Kat\v{e}tov showed that if $\omega < \kappa =
\kappa^{< \kappa}$, then there exists a $\kappa$-superuniversal $K$ which is
moreover $\kappa$-homogeneous, i.e. every isometry of a subspace $Y\subseteq K$
with $|Y|<\kappa$ can be extended to an isometry of the whole $K$. In
connection of this W. Kubi\'s suggested that there should also exist a
$\kappa$-superuniversal space that is not $\kappa$-homogeneous. In this paper
there is shown that for every cardinal $\kappa$ there exists a
$\kappa$-superuniversal space which is rigid, i.e. has exactly one isometry,
namely the identity. The construction involves an amalgamation-like property of
a family of metric spaces.

parameter takes the complex value $\gamma=\pm i$. We refer to this new quantum
cosmology as complex Loop Quantum Cosmology. We proceed in making an analytic
continuation of the Hamiltonian constraint (with no inverse volume corrections)
from real $\gamma$ to $\gamma=\pm i$ in the simple case of a flat FLRW Universe
coupled to a massless scalar field with no cosmological constant. For that
purpose, we first compute the non-local curvature operator (defined by the
trace of the holonomy of the connection around a fundamental plaquette)
evaluated in any spin $j$ representation and we find a new close formula for
it. This allows to define explicitly a one parameter family of regularizations
of the Hamiltonian constraint in LQC, parametrized by the spin $j$. It is
immediate to see that any spin $j$ regularization leads to a bounce scenario.
Then, motivated particularly by previous results on black hole thermodynamics,
we perform the analytic continuation of the Hamiltonian constraint defined by
$\gamma=\pm i$ and $j=-1/2+is$ where $s$ is real. Even if the area spectrum is
now continuous, we show that the so-defined complex LQC removes also the
original singularity which is replaced by a quantum bounce. In addition, the
maximal density and the minimal volume of the Universe are obviously
independent of $\gamma$. Furthermore, the dynamics before and after the bounce
are no more symmetric, which makes a clear distinction between these two phases
of the evolution of the Universe.

spectrum is the deepest ever obtained of a galaxy in the Reionization epoch. We
do not detect any emission line or continuum over the whole wavelength range,

stringent upper limit of f(Lya)<3x10^(-18) erg/s/cm2 at 3-9 sigma in the
explored wavelength range, corresponding to a rest-frame equivalent width
EW<9A. Combining this limit with the SED modelling we refine the redshift to be
z=6.82+/- 0.1 (1-sigma). The same SED fitting indicates that GDS-1408 is
relatively extinct (A1600~1) with a dust corrected star formation rate of ~ 20
Msol/yr. The comparison between the un-attenuated equivalent width predicted by
the case-B recombination theory and the observed upper limit, provides a limit
on the effective Lya escape fraction of f_(esc)^(eff)(Lya)<8%. Even though we
cannot rule out a major contribution of the inter/circum galactic medium in
damping the line, a plausible interpretation is that GDS-1408 is moderately
evolved and contains sufficient gas and dust to attenuate the Lya emission,

intriguing and quantitatively reliable description of nuclear matter. Indeed,
the model has both the symmetries and the energy-momentum tensor of a perfect
fluid, and thus represents a field theoretic realization of the ""liquid
droplet"" model of nuclear matter. In addition, the classical soliton solutions
together with some obvious corrections (spin-isospin quantization, Coulomb
energy, proton-neutron mass difference) provide an accurate modeling of nuclear
binding energies for heavier nuclei. These results lead to the rather natural
proposal to try to describe also neutron stars by the BPS Skyrme model coupled
to gravity. We find that the resulting self-gravitating BPS Skyrmions provide
excellent results as well as some new perspectives for the description of bulk
properties of neutron stars when the parameter values of the model are
extracted from nuclear physics. Specifically, the maximum possible mass of a
neutron star before black-hole formation sets in is a few solar masses, the
precise value depending on the precise values of the model parameters, and the
resulting neutron star radius is of the order of 10 km.

($grizYJK$) photometric catalogues are produced in a single 3 sq-deg DECam
field centred at 02h26m$-$04d36m where the availability of ancillary
multi-wavelength photometry and spectroscopy allows us to test the data
quality. Dual photometry increases the number of DES galaxies with measured VHS
fluxes by a factor of $\sim$4.5 relative to a simple catalogue level matching
and results in a $\sim$1.5 mag increase in the 80\% completeness limit of the
NIR data. Almost 70\% of DES sources have useful NIR flux measurements in this
initial catalogue. Photometric redshifts are estimated for a subset of galaxies
with spectroscopic redshifts and initial results, although currently limited by
small number statistics, indicate that the VHS data can help reduce the
photometric redshift scatter at both $z<0.5$ and $z>1$. We present example
DES+VHS colour selection criteria for high redshift Luminous Red Galaxies
(LRGs) at $z\sim0.7$ as well as luminous quasars. Using spectroscopic
observations in this field we show that the additional VHS fluxes enable a
cleaner selection of both populations with $<$10\% contamination from galactic
stars in the case of spectroscopically confirmed quasars and $<0.5\%$
contamination from galactic stars in the case of spectroscopically confirmed
LRGs. The combined DES+VHS dataset, which will eventually cover almost 5000

target selection for future wide-field spectroscopic surveys.

the last two decades, a considerable effort has been devoted to the study of
new entropic forms, which generalize the standard Boltzmann-Gibbs (BG) entropy
and are widely applicable in thermodynamics, quantum mechanics and information
theory. In [23], by extending previous ideas of Shannon [38], [39], Khinchin
proposed an axiomatic definition of the BG entropy, based on four requirements,
nowadays known as the Shannon-Khinchin (SK) axioms.
  The purpose of this paper is twofold. First, we show that there exists an
intrinsic group-theoretical structure behind the notion of entropy. It comes
from the requirement of composability of an entropy with respect to the union
of two statistically independent subsystems, that we propose in an axiomatic
formulation. Second, we show that there exists a simple universal class of
admissible entropies. This class contains many well known examples of entropies
and infinitely many new ones, a priori multi-parametric. Due to its specific
relation with the universal formal group, the new family of entropies
introduced in this work will be called the universal-group entropy. A new
example of multi-parametric entropy is explicitly constructed.

proposed methodology of non-linear mutual connectivity analysis (MCA) involves
two computational steps. First, the pair-wise cross-prediction performance
between resting state fMRI pixel time series within the brain is evaluated. The
underlying network structure is subsequently recovered from the affinity matrix
constructed through MCA using non-metric network partitioning/clustering with
the so-called Louvain method. We demonstrate our methodology in the task of
identifying regions of the motor cortex associated with hand movement on
resting state fMRI data acquired from eight slice locations in four subjects.
For comparison, we also localized regions of the motor cortex through a
task-based fMRI sequence involving a finger-tapping stimulus paradigm. Finally,
we integrate convergent cross mapping (CCM) into the first step of MCA for
investigating causality between regions of the motor cortex. Results regarding
causation between regions of the motor cortex revealed a significant
directional variability and were not readily interpretable in a consistent
manner across all subjects. However, our results on whole-slice fMRI analysis
demonstrate that MCA-based model-free recovery of regions associated with the
primary motor cortex and supplementary motor area are in close agreement with
localization of similar regions achieved with a task-based fMRI acquisition.
Thus, we conclude that our computational framework MCA can extract and
visualize valuable information concerning the underlying network structure and
causation between different regions of the brain in resting state fMRI.

is potentially a powerful approach for learning about the universe itself. In
this paper we examine the merger history of dark matter halos based on the
Extended Press-Schechter formalism as a function of cosmological parameters,
redshift and halo mass. We calculate how major halo mergers are influenced by
changes in the cosmological values of $\Omega_{\rm m}$, $\Omega_{\Lambda}$,
$\sigma_{8}$, the dark matter particle temperature (warm vs. cold dark matter),
and the value of a constant and evolving equation of state parameter $w(z)$. We
find that the merger fraction at a given halo mass varies by up to a factor of
three for halos forming under the assumption of Cold Dark Matter, within
different underling cosmological parameters. We find that the current
measurements of the merger history, as measured through observed galaxy pairs
as well as through structure, are in agreement with the concordance cosmology
with the current best fit giving $1 - \Omega_{\rm m} = \Omega_{\rm \Lambda} =
0.84^{+0.16}_{-0.17}$. To obtain a more accurate constraint competitive with
recently measured cosmological parameters from Planck and WMAP requires a
measured merger accuracy of $\delta f_{\rm m} \sim 0.01$, implying surveys with
an accurately measured merger history over 2 - 20 deg$^{2}$, which will be
feasible with the next generation of imaging and spectroscopic surveys such as

Hochberg [J. Roy. Statist. Soc. Ser. B 57 (1995) 289-300] procedure (BH) which
compares more significant $p$-values with more stringent thresholds. One
notable choice of the sequence $\{\lambda_i\}$ is given by the BH critical
values $\lambda_{\mathrm {BH}}(i)=z(1-i\cdot q/2p)$, where $q\in(0,1)$ and
$z(\alpha)$ is the quantile of a standard normal distribution. SLOPE aims to
provide finite sample guarantees on the selected model; of special interest is
the false discovery rate (FDR), defined as the expected proportion of
irrelevant regressors among all selected predictors. Under orthogonal designs,
SLOPE with $\lambda_{\mathrm{BH}}$ provably controls FDR at level $q$.
Moreover, it also appears to have appreciable inferential properties under more
general designs $X$ while having substantial power, as demonstrated in a series
of experiments running on both simulated and real data.

measure (DM) evolution and so forth. In this paper, we describe the channelised
Discrete Fourier Transform method that can greatly mitigate the influence of
the aforementioned effects when measuring ToAs from broadband timing data. The
method is tested on simulated data, and its potential in improving timing

regrouping has previously been applied to IMC-DDMC calculations for problems in
which the dependence of the opacity on frequency is monotonic. We generalize
opacity regrouping to non-contiguous groups and implement this in \supernu, a
code designed to do radiation transport in high-velocity outflows with
non-monotonic opacities. We find that regrouping of non-contiguous opacity
groups generally improves the speed of IMC-DDMC radiation transport. We present
an asymptotic analysis that informs the nature of the Doppler shift in DDMC
groups and summarize the derivation of the Gentile-Fleck factor for modified
IMC-DDMC. We test \supernu\ using numerical experiments including a
quasi-manufactured analytic solution, a simple ten-group problem, and the W7
problem for Type Ia supernovae. We find that the opacity regrouping is
necessary to make our IMC-DDMC implementation feasible for the W7 problem and
possibly Type Ia supernova simulations in general. We compare the bolometric
light curves and spectra produced by the \supernu\ and \phoenix\ radiation
transport codes for the W7 problem. The overall shape of the bolometric light
curves are in good agreement, as are the spectra and their evolution with time.

observations to identify the evolutionary sequence from starbursts to fully
quenched post-starbursts in the narrow mass range $\log M(M_\odot) =
10.3-10.7$, and identifies ""transiting"" post-starbursts which are intermediate
between these two populations. In this mass range, $\sim 0.3\%$ of galaxies are
starbursts, $\sim 0.1\%$ are quenched post-starbursts, and $\sim 0.5\%$ are the
transiting types in between. The transiting post-starbursts have stellar
properties that are predicted for fast-quenching starbursts and morphological
characteristics that are already typical of early-type galaxies. The AGN
fraction, as estimated from optical line ratios, of these post-starbursts is
about 3 times higher ($\gtrsim 36 \pm 8 \%$) than that of normal star-forming
galaxies of the same mass, but there is a significant delay between the
starburst phase and the peak of nuclear optical AGN activity (median age
difference of $\gtrsim 200 \pm 100$ Myr), in agreement with previous studies.
The time delay is inferred by comparing the broad-band near NUV-to-optical
photometry with stellar population synthesis models. We also find that
starbursts and post-starbursts are significantly more dust-obscured than normal
star-forming galaxies in the same mass range. About $20\%$ of the starbursts
and $15\%$ of the transiting post-starbursts can be classified as the
""Dust-Obscured Galaxies"" (DOGs), while only $0.8\%$ of normal galaxies are
DOGs.The time delay between the starburst phase and AGN activity suggests that
AGN do not play a primary role in the original quenching of starbursts but may
be responsible for quenching later low-level star formation during the
post-starburst phase.

achieves better performance than using either dictionary alone. Second, we

convergence. Third, we propose a two-stage randomized sampling scheme to
optimally choose the sampling locations, thus maximizing the reconstruction

shown that compress-and-forward based strategies can achieve the capacity of
this network within an additive gap. Here, the relays quantize their received
signals at the noise level and map them to random Gaussian codebooks. The
resultant gap to capacity is independent of the SNRs of the channels in the

  In this paper, we provide an improved lower bound on the rate achieved by
compress-and-forward based strategies (noisy network coding in particular) in
arbitrary Gaussian relay networks, whose gap to capacity depends on the network
not only through the total number of nodes but also through the degrees of

this refined lower bound can lead to a better approximation of the capacity. In
particular, we demonstrate that it leads to a logarithmic rather than linear
capacity gap in the total number of nodes for certain classes of layered

gases of the highly magnetic atom dysprosium: the more energy that is released,
the less frequently these exothermic reactions take place, and only quantum
spin statistics can explain this counterintuitive effect. Inelastic dipolar
scattering in non-zero magnetic fields leads to heating or to loss of the
trapped population, both detrimental to experiments intended to study quantum
many-body physics with strongly dipolar gases. Fermi statistics, however, is
predicted to lead to a kinematic suppression of these harmful reactions.
Indeed, we observe a 120-fold suppression of dipolar relaxation in fermionic
versus bosonic Dy, as expected from theory describing universal inelastic
dipolar scattering, though never before experimentally confirmed. Similarly low
inelastic cross sections are observed in spin mixtures, also with striking
correspondence to universal dipolar scattering predictions. The suppression of

flexibility for application domains not envisioned by the language designer.
Only a few languages, such as C++ and Haskell, provide the necessary power to
define $n$-dimensional arrays, but these systems rely on compile-time
abstraction, sacrificing some flexibility. In contrast, dynamic languages make
it straightforward for the user to define any behavior they might want, but at

while multiple dispatch has not been especially popular in most kinds of

functions such as array indexing using multi-method signatures, a surprising
range of behaviors can be obtained, in a way that is both relatively easy to

action depends on the gravitational and matter Lagrangian. The gravitational
Lagrangian depends on the metric tensor and its first and second derivatives.
The matter Lagrangian includes dark matter, dark energy and the ordinary
baryonic matter. The total Lagrangian is expanded in an asymptotic Taylor
series around the background manifold defined as a solution of Einstein's
equations in the form of the Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) metric
tensor. The small parameter of the decomposition is the magnitude of the metric
tensor perturbation. Each term of the series expansion is gauge-invariant and
all of them together form a basis for the successive post-Friedmannian
approximations. The approximation scheme is covariant and the asymptotic nature
of the Lagrangian decomposition does not require the post-Friedmannian
perturbations to be small though computationally it works the most effectively
when the perturbed metric is close enough to the background FLRW metric. The
temporal evolution of the background metric is governed by dark matter and dark
energy and we associate the large scale inhomogeneities in these two components
as those generated by the primordial cosmological perturbations. The small
scale inhomogeneities are generated by the condensations of baryonic matter
considered as the bare perturbations. We explicitly work out the covariant
field equations of the successive post-Friedmannian approximations of
Einstein's equations and derive equations of motion of large and small scale
inhomogeneities of dark matter and dark energy. We apply these equations to

the Higgs boson mass to be on the order of the gauge boson mass we find that

another and make very specific predictions for natural supersymmetric spectra.
Highly natural spectra are characterized by light higgsinos with mass not too
far from m_h and well-mixed but TeV-scale third generation squarks. We apply
the unified naturalness measure to the case of heavy Higgs bosons A, H and
H^\pm. We find that their masses are bounded from above by naturalness
depending on tan(beta): e.g. for 10% fine-tuning and tan(beta)~ 10, we expect
m_A< 2.5 TeV whilst for 3% fine-tuning and tan(beta) as high as 50, then m_A< 8
TeV. Furthermore, the presence of light higgsinos seriously alters the heavy
Higgs boson branching ratios, thus diminishing prospects for usual searches
into Standard Model (SM) final states, while new discovery possibilities arise
due to the supersymmetric decay modes. The heavy SUSY decay modes tend to be H,
A, H^\pm-> W, Z, or h+MET + soft tracks so that single heavy Higgs production
is characterized by the presence of high p_T W, Z or h bosons plus missing E_T.

problem, extensive efforts have been devoted to design efficient signal
quantization/compression techniques in the fronthaul to maximize the network
throughput. However, most of the previous results are based on
information-theoretical quantization methods, which are hard to implement due
to the extremely high complexity. In this paper, we consider using practical
uniform scalar quantization in the uplink communication of an orthogonal
frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) based C-RAN system, where the mobile
users are assigned with orthogonal sub-carriers for multiple access. In
particular, we consider joint wireless power control and fronthaul quantization
design over the sub-carriers to maximize the system end-to-end throughput.
Efficient algorithms are proposed to solve the joint optimization problem when
either information-theoretical or practical fronthaul quantization method is
applied. Interestingly, we find that the fronthaul capacity constraints have
significant impact to the optimal wireless power control policy. As a result,
the joint optimization shows significant performance gain compared with either
optimizing wireless power control or fronthaul quantization alone. Besides, we
also show that the proposed simple uniform quantization scheme performs very
close to the throughput performance upper bound, and in fact overlaps with the
upper bound when the fronthaul capacity is sufficiently large. Overall, our
results would help reveal practically achievable throughput performance of
C-RAN, and lead to more efficient deployment of C-RAN in the next-generation

much set theory can be developed within these consistent fragments of the

appeals to G\""odel's constructible universe of sets, which G\""odel famously
used to show the relative consistency of the continuum hypothesis. More
specifically, our proofs appeal to Kripke and Platek's idea of the projectum

transmission between two distant parties. However, in practical
implementations, it suffers from quantum hacking due to device imperfections.
Here we propose a hybrid measurement attack, with only linear optics, homodyne
detection, and single photon detection, to the widely used vacuum+weak decoy
state QKD system when the phase of source is partially randomized. Our analysis
shows that, in some parameter regimes, the proposed attack would result in an
entanglement breaking channel but still be able to trick the legitimate users
to believe they have transmitted secure keys. That is, the eavesdropper is able
to steal all the key information without discovered by the users. Thus, our
proposal reveals that partial phase randomization is not sufficient to
guarantee the security of phase-encoding QKD systems with weak coherent states.

important for both fundamental science and the future development of quantum
technologies. This development will also require an efficient quantum interface
between multimode quantum light sources and atomic ensembles, which makes it
necessary to implement multimode quantum light sources that match the atomic
transitions. Here we report on such a source that provides a method for
generating quantum correlated beams that can be extended to a large number of
modes by using multiple four-wave mixing (FWM) processes in hot rubidium vapor.
Experimentally we show that two cascaded FWM processes produce strong quantum
correlations between three bright beams but not between any two of them. In
addition, the intensity-difference squeezing is enhanced with the cascaded
system to -7.0 $\pm$ 0.1 dB from the -5.5 $\pm$ 0.1/-4.5 $\pm$ 0.1 dB squeezing
obtained with only one FWM process. One of the main advantages of our system is
that as the number of quantum modes increases, so does the total degree of
quantum correlations. The proposed method is also immune to phase instabilities
due to its phase insensitive nature, can easily be extended to multiple modes,
and has potential applications in the production of multiple quantum correlated
images.

layer signal to leakage plus noise ratio (layer SLNR) scheme, for multi-user
multi-layer MIMO systems. Specifically, the layer SLNR scheme incorporates the
MIMO receiver structure into the precoder design procedure, which makes the
formulation of signal power and interference / leakage power more accurate.
Besides, the layer SLNR scheme not only takes into account the inter-layer
interference from different users, but also takes care of the inter-layer
interference from the same user which is usually assumed to be zero in previous
studies. As a result, the proposed layer SLNR scheme produces a good balance
between the layer signal power and layer interference power in a multi-user
multi-layer MIMO system, therefore achieves better system performance. The
effectiveness and superiority of the proposed layer SLNR scheme are validated

previously employed in various investigations of the underlying mixings among
scalar mesons below and above 1 GeV (as well as those of their pseudoscalar

properties and quark substructure of these states. It is found that the linear
sigma model with only a single lowest-lying nonet is not accurate in predicting
the decay width, but inclusion of the mixing of this nonet with the
next-to-lowest lying nonet, together with the effect of final state interaction
of pions, significantly improves this prediction and agrees with experiment up
to about 1\%. It is also shown that while the prediction of the leading order
of the generalized model for the Dalitz parameters is not close to the

expected to improve with further refinement of the complicated underlying

The problem arises in estimating the compliance matrix to model deformable

that the data matrix is unrealistically error free. Here, considering error in
measured data and target matrices, we propose a new approach to solve a

consider solving the problem when the rank of the unknown matrix is known, by
defining a new error formulation for the positive semi-definite total least

quadratic convergence of our proposed approach. We then describe how to
generalize our proposed method to solve the general positive semi-definite

another filament (F2), and some plasma of F1 fell down to the northern region
close to F2 and caused the plasma to brighten. Meanwhile, the North-East part
of F2 first started to be active and rise, but did not erupt finally. Then the
South-West part of F2 erupted successfully. Therefore, the F2's eruption is a
partial filament eruption. Two associated CMEs related to the eruptions were
observed by STEREO/COR1. We find two possible reasons that lead to the
instability and the eruption of F2. One main reason is that the magnetic loops
overlying the two filaments were partially opened by the eruptive F1 and
resulted in the instability of F2. The other is that the downflows from F1
might break the stability of F2.

electron doped and has relatively good two dimensionality. On the other hand,
the Ir 5d electrons are metallic and glassy probably due to atomic disorder

and also a major concern in rare event non-accelerator particle physics
experiments such as dark matter and double beta decay searches, where it is a
major source of background. Notable for dark matter experiments is the
production of radon progeny recoils (RPRs), the low energy (~100 keV) recoils
of radon daughter isotopes, which can mimic the signal expected from WIMP
interactions. Presented here are results of measurements of radon emanation
from detector materials in the 1 metre cubed DRIFT-II directional dark matter

emanation facility for this work is described, along with an analysis to
continuously monitor DRIFT data for the presence of internal 222Rn and 218Po.
Applying this analysis to historical DRIFT data, we show how systematic
substitution of detector materials for alternatives, selected by this device
for low radon emanation, has resulted in a factor of ~10 reduction in internal
radon rates. Levels are found to be consistent with the sum from separate radon
emanation measurements of the internal materials and also with direct
measurement using an attached alpha spectrometer. The current DRIFT detector,
DRIFT-IId, is found to have sensitivity to 222Rn of 2.5 {\mu}Bq/l with current

their full theoretical analysis is still an open problem. As a first step,
simplified models such as purely random forests have been introduced, in order
to shed light on the good performance of random forests. In this paper, we
study the approximation error (the bias) of some purely random forest models in
a regression framework, focusing in particular on the influence of the number
of trees in the forest. Under some regularity assumptions on the regression
function, we show that the bias of an infinite forest decreases at a faster
rate (with respect to the size of each tree) than a single tree. As a
consequence, infinite forests attain a strictly better risk rate (with respect
to the sample size) than single trees. Furthermore, our results allow to derive
a minimum number of trees sufficient to reach the same rate as an infinite
forest. As a by-product of our analysis, we also show a link between the bias
of purely random forests and the bias of some kernel estimators.

introduction of user telemetry in game development, which provides
unprecedented access to quantitative data on user behavior from the installed
game clients of the entire population of players. Player behavior telemetry
datasets can be exceptionally complex, with features recorded for a varying
population of users over a temporal segment that can reach years in duration.
Categorization of behaviors, whether through descriptive methods (e.g.
segmention) or unsupervised/supervised learning techniques, is valuable for
finding patterns in the behavioral data, and developing profiles that are
actionable to game developers. There are numerous methods for unsupervised
clustering of user behavior, e.g. k-means/c-means, Non-negative Matrix
Factorization, or Principal Component Analysis. Although all yield behavior
categorizations, interpretation of the resulting categories in terms of actual
play behavior can be difficult if not impossible. In this paper, a range of
unsupervised techniques are applied together with Archetypal Analysis to
develop behavioral clusters from playtime data of 70,014 World of Warcraft
players, covering a five year interval. The techniques are evaluated with
respect to their ability to develop actionable behavioral profiles from the
dataset.

uncertainties from the residues between the calculation of a theoretical model
and the observed data. The residues and the parameters of the model can be
obtained through the standard statistical fitting procedures. The present work
concentrates on the decomposition of the total uncertainty, of which the
distribution corresponds to that of the residues. The distribution of the total
uncertainty is considered as two normal distributions, statistical and
systematic uncertainties. The standard deviation of the statistical part,
{\sigma}stat, is estimated through random parameters distributed around their
best fitted values. The two normal distributions are obtained by minimizing the
moments of the distribution of the residues with the fixed {\sigma}stat. The
method is applied to the liquid drop model (LD). The statistical and systematic
uncertainties are decomposed from the residues of the nuclear binding energies
with and without the consideration of the shell effect in LD. The estimated
distributions of the statistical and systematic uncertainties can well describe
that of the residues. The normal assumption of the distribution of the
statistical and systematic uncertainties is examined through various
approaches. The comparison between the distributions of the specific nuclei and
those of the statistical and systematic uncertainties are consistent with the
physical considerations, although the latter two can be obtained without the
knowledge of these considerations. Such as, the LD are more suitable to
describe the heavy nuclei. The light and heavy nuclei are indeed distributed
mostly inside the distributions of the statistical and systematic
uncertainties, respectively. The similar situation are also found for the
nuclei close to and far from shell. The present method is also performed to
nuclei around stability line.

multiple NuSTAR observations combined with archival Suzaku and Chandra data of
NGC4945, the brightest extragalactic source at 100 keV. We observe hard X-ray
(> 10 keV) flux and spectral variability, with flux variations of a factor 2 on
timescales of 20 ksec. A variable primary continuum dominates the high energy
spectrum (>10 keV) in all the states, while the reflected/scattered flux which
dominates at E< 10 keV stays approximately constant. From modelling the complex
reflection/transmission spectrum we derive a Compton depth along the line of
sight of tau_Thomson ~ 2.9, and a global covering factor for the circumnuclear
gas of ~ 0.15. This agrees with the constraints derived from the high energy
variability, which implies that most of the high energy flux is transmitted,
rather that Compton-scattered. This demonstrates the effectiveness of spectral
analysis in constraining the geometric properties of the circumnuclear gas, and
validates similar methods used for analyzing the spectra of other bright,
Compton-thick AGN. The lower limits on the e-folding energy are between 200-300
keV, consistent with previous BeppoSAX, Suzaku and Swift BAT observations. The
accretion rate, estimated from the X-ray luminosity and assuming a bolometric
correction typical of type 2 AGN, is in the range ~0.1-0.3 lambda_Edd depending
on the flux state. The substantial observed X-ray luminosity variability of
NGC4945 implies that large errors can arise from using single-epoch X-ray data

AO (WFAO) mark the beginning of a new era. By using multiple Guide Stars (GSs),
either Laser Guide Stars (LGSs) or Natural Guide Stars (NGSs), WFAO
significantly increases the field of view of the AO-corrected images, and the
fraction of the sky that can benefit from such correction. Different typologies
of WFAO have been studied over the past years. They all require multiple GSs to
perform a tomographic analysis of the atmospheric turbulence. One of the
fundamental aspects of the new WFAO systems is the knowledge of the
spatio-temporal distribution of the turbulence above the telescope. One way to
get to this information is to use the telemetry data provided by the WFAO
system itself. Indeed, it has been demonstrated that WFAO systems allows one to
derive the Cn2 and wind profile in the main turbulence layers (see e.g. Cortes
et al. 2012). This method has the evident advantage to provide information on
the turbulence stratification that effectively affects the AO system, property
more difficultly respected by independently vertical profilers. In this paper,
we compare the wind speeds profiles of GeMS with those predicted by a
non-hydrostatical mesoscale atmospherical model (Meso-NH). It has been proved
(Masciadri et al., 2013), indeed, that this model is able to provide reliable
wind speed profiles on the whole troposphere and stratosphere (up to 20-25 km)
above top-level astronomical sites. Correlation with measurements revealed to
be very satisfactory when the model performances are analyzed from a
statistical point of view as well on individual nights. Such a system appears
therefore as an interesting reference to be used to quantify the GeMS wind

GHz is closely connected with their optical discs. The strengths of total
magnetic field are within 5-9 \mu G, while the ordered fields reach 1-2 \mu G.
The magnetic field strengths are well correlated with the surface density of
SFR and manifest a power-law relation with an exponent of 0.25 extending a
similar relation found for dwarf galaxies. The production of magnetic energy
per supernova event is similar for all the various galaxies. It constitutes
about 3% of the individual SN energy release. We show that the total magnetic
field energy in galaxies is almost linearly related to the galactic gas mass,
which indicates equipartition of the magnetic energy and the turbulent kinetic
energy of the ISM. The Magellanic-type galaxies fit very well with the
radio-infrared relation constructed for surface brightness of galaxies of
various types, including bright spirals and interacting objects. We found that
the typical far-infrared relation based on luminosity of galaxies is tighter
and steeper but more likely to inherit a partial correlation from a tendency
that larger objects are also more luminous. The thermal fractions, radio
spectral indices, and magnetic field strengths of the Magellanic-type galaxies
are between the values determined for spirals and dwarf galaxies. The confirmed
magnetic field-star formation and radio-infrared relations for low-mass
galaxies point to similar physical processes that must be at work in all

dust polarization at 870 $\mu$m obtained with the Submillimeter Array (SMA).
The SMA observations reveal polarization at scales of $\lsim$ 0.1 pc. The
polarization pattern in these objects ranges from ordered hour-glass
configurations to more chaotic distributions. By comparing the SMA data with
the single dish data at parsec scales, we found that magnetic fields at dense
core scales are either aligned within $40^\circ$ of or perpendicular to the
parsec-scale magnetic fields. This finding indicates that magnetic fields play
an important role during the collapse and fragmentation of massive molecular
clumps and the formation of dense cores. We further compare magnetic fields in
dense cores with the major axis of molecular outflows. Despite a limited number
of outflows, we found that the outflow axis appears to be randomly oriented
with respect to the magnetic field in the core. This result suggests that at
the scale of accretion disks ($\lsim 10^3$ AU), angular momentum and dynamic
interactions possibly due to close binary or multiple systems dominate over
magnetic fields. With this unprecedentedly large sample massive clumps, we
argue on a statistical basis that magnetic fields play an important role during

Erdos-Renyi (ER) graphs is analyzed in this work. As quasirandom graphs, the
complete, Paley, and ER graphs share many structural properties. For instance,
they exhibit the same asymptotics of the edge distributions, homomorphism
densities, graph spectra, and have constant graph limits. Nonetheless, we show
that the asymptotic behavior of solutions in the KM on these graphs can be
qualitatively different. Specifically, we identify twisted states, steady state
solutions of the KM on complete and Paley graphs, which are stable for one
family of graphs but not for the other. On the other hand, we show that the
solutions of the IVPs for the KM on complete and random graphs remain close on
finite time intervals, provided they start from close initial conditions and
the graphs are sufficiently large. Therefore, the results of this paper
elucidate the relation between the network structure and dynamics in coupled
nonlinear dynamical systems. Furthermore, we present new results on
synchronization and stability of twisted states for the KM on Cayley and random
graphs.

$\iota$~Her on 5 consecutive nights in 2012 with the ESPaDOnS
spectropolarimeter at the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope, with the aim of
searching for the presence of weak and/or complex magnetic fields.
Least-Squares Deconvolution mean profiles were computed from individual
spectra, averaged over individual nights and over the entire run. No Zeeman
signatures are detected in any of the profiles. The longitudinal magnetic field
in the grand average profile was measured to be $-0.24 \pm 0.32 $ G, as
compared to $-0.22 \pm 0.32$ G in the null profile. Our observations therefore
provide no evidence for the presence of Zeeman signatures analogous to those
observed in the A0V star Vega by Lignieres et al. (2009). We interpret these
observations in three ways. First, we compare the LSD profiles with synthetic
Stokes $V$ profiles corresponding to organised (dipolar) magnetic fields, for
which we find an upper limit of about 8~G on the polar strength of any surface
dipole present. Secondly, we compare the grand average profile with
calculations corresponding to the random magnetic spot topologies of Kochukhov
& Sudnik (2013), inferring that spots, if present, of 2 degrees radius with
strengths of 2-4 G and a filling factor of 50% should have been detected in our
data. Finally, we compare the observations with synthetic $V$ profiles
corresponding to the surface magnetic maps of Vega (Petit et al. 2010) computed
for the spectral characteristics of $\iota$ Her. We conclude that while it is
unlikely we would have detected a magnetic field identical to Vega's, we would
have likely detected one with a peak strength of about 30 G, i.e. approximately
four times as strong as that of Vega.

challenges to EA-based optimization. The presence of noise interferes with the

performance. In addition, as presence of noise poses challenges to the
evaluation of the fitness function, it may need to be estimated instead of
being evaluated. Several existing approaches attempt to address this problem,
such as introduction of diversity (hyper mutation, random immigrants, special
operators) or incorporation of memory of the past (diploidy, case based
memory). However, these approaches fail to adequately address the problem. In
this paper we propose a Distributed Population Switching Evolutionary Algorithm

using a distributed population switching architecture, to simulate a
distributed self-adaptive memory of the solution space. Local regression is
used in the pseudo-populations to estimate the fitness. Successful applications
to benchmark test problems ascertain the proposed method's superior performance
in terms of both robustness and accuracy.

inferred from broad and narrow-band 0.9-4.8 microns photometry. We used
commissioning data of the Gemini Planet Imager (GPI) to obtain new astrometry
and a low-resolution (R=35-39) J-band (1.12-1.35 microns) spectrum of the
planet. We find that the planet has passed the quadrature. We constrain its
semi-major axis to $\leq$ 10 AU (90 % prob.) with a peak at 8.9+0.4-0.6 AU. The
joint fit of the planet astrometry and the most recent radial velocity
measurements of the star yields a planet's dynamical mass $\leq$ 20 MJup
(greater than 96 % prob.). The extracted spectrum of Beta Pic b is similar to
those of young L1-1.5+1 dwarfs. We use the spectral type estimate to revise the
planet luminosity to log(L/Lsun)=-3.90+-0.07. The 0.9-4.8 microns photometry
and spectrum are reproduced for Teff=1650+-150 K and a log g lower than 4.7 dex
by 12 grids of PHOENIX-based and LESIA atmospheric models. If we adopt the most
recent system age estimate (21+-4 Myr), the bolometric luminosity and the
constraints on the dynamical mass of Beta Pic b are only reproduced by warm-
and hot-start tracks with initial entropies Si greater than 10.5 kB/baryon.
Such initial conditions may result from an inefficient accretion shock and/or a
planetesimal density at formation higher than in the classical core accretion
model. Considering a younger age for the system or a conservative formation
time for Beta Pic b does not change these conclusions.

hotbeds). The model was constructed as a system of first order nonlinear ODEs
in four compartment variables. We perform a bifurcation analysis of the
equilibria of the model using the severity of the hotbeds as the control
parameter. Depending on the non-dimensional grapevine density of the vineyard
we find either a single family of equilibria in which the health of the
vineyard gradually deteriorates for progressively more severe hotbeds, or
multiple equilibria that give rise to sudden transitions from a nearly healthy
vineyard to a severely deteriorated one when the severity of the hotbeds
crosses a critical value. These results suggest some lines of intervention for
limiting the spread of the disease.

model. Specifically, we derive solvent radii from the nonlocal dielectric
response of the solvent from ab initio calculations, construct a closed-form
and parameter-free weighted-density approximation for the free energy of the
cavity formation, and employ a pair-potential approximation for the dispersion
energy. We show that the resulting model with a single solvent-independent
parameter: the electron density threshold ($n_c$), and a single
solvent-dependent parameter: the dispersion scale factor ($s_6$), reproduces
solvation energies of organic molecules in water, chloroform and carbon
tetrachloride with RMS errors of 1.1, 0.6 and 0.5 kcal/mol respectively. We
additionally show that fitting the solvent-dependent $s_6$ parameter to the
solvation energy of a single non-polar molecule does not substantially increase
these errors. Parametrization of this model for other solvents, therefore,
requires minimal effort and is possible without extensive databases of
experimental solvation free energies.

the most fundamental open questions for human being. In this paper, 10000
samples of reliable (convergent), multiple-scale (from 1.0E-60 to 100)
numerical simulations of a chaotic three-body system indicate that, without any
external disturbance, the microscopic inherent uncertainty (in the level of
1.0E-60) due to physical fluctuation of initial positions of the three-body
system enlarges exponentially into macroscopic randomness (at the level O(1))
until t=T*, the so-called physical limit time of prediction, but propagates
algebraically thereafter when accurate prediction of orbit is impossible. Note
that these 10000 samples use micro-level, inherent physical fluctuations of
initial position, which have nothing to do with human being. Especially, the
differences of these 10000 fluctuations are mathematically so small (in the
level of 1.0E-60) that they are physically the SAME since a distance shorter
than a Planck length does not make physical senses according to the spring
theory. It indicates that the macroscopic randomness of the chaotic three-body
system is self-excited, say, without any external force or disturbances, from
the inherent micro-level uncertainty. This provides us the new concept
""self-excited macroscopic randomness (uncertainty)"". In addition, it is found
that, without any external disturbance, the chaotic three-body system might
randomly disrupt with the symmetry-breaking at t=1000 in about 25% probability,
which provides us the new concepts ""self-excited random disruption"",
""self-excited random escape"" and ""self-excited symmetry breaking"" of the
chaotic three-body system. It suggests that a chaotic three-body system might
randomly evolve by itself, without any external forces or disturbance.

adopt a novel variant called aggregate channel features, make a full
exploration of feature design, and discover a multi-scale version of features
with better performance. To deal with poses of faces in the wild, we propose a
multi-view detection approach featuring score re-ranking and detection

multi-view face detector using aggregate channel features shows competitive
performance against state-of-the-art algorithms on AFW and FDDB testsets, while

contain the mean stellar positions and magnitudes from the first year of
observations. For more than 100 000 stars in common with the Hipparcos
Catalogue it will be possible to compute very accurate proper motions due to
the time difference of about 24 years between the two missions. This Hundred
Thousand Proper Motions (HTPM) project will be part of the first release. Our
aim is to investigate how early Gaia data can be optimally combined with
information from the Hipparcos Catalogue in order to provide the most accurate
and reliable results for HTPM. The Astrometric Global Iterative Solution (AGIS)
was developed to compute the astrometric core solution based on the Gaia
observations and will be used for all releases of astrometric data from Gaia.
We adapt AGIS to process Hipparcos data in addition to Gaia observations, and
use simulations to verify and study the joint solution method. For the HTPM
stars we predict proper motion accuracies between 14 and 134 muas/yr, depending
on stellar magnitude and amount of Gaia data available. Perspective effects
will be important for a significant number of HTPM stars, and in order to treat
these effects accurately we introduce a scaled model of kinematics. We define a
goodness-of-fit statistic which is sensitive to deviations from uniform space
motion, caused for example by binaries with periods of 10-50 years. HTPM will
significantly improve the proper motions of the Hipparcos Catalogue well before
highly accurate Gaia- only results become available. Also, HTPM will allow us
to detect long period binary and exoplanetary candidates which would be
impossible to detect from Gaia data alone. The full sensitivity will not be
reached with the first Gaia release but with subsequent data releases.
Therefore HTPM should be repeated when more Gaia data become available.

different constraints such as performance, code size and power consumption in
rapidly evolving hardware and software environments. However, in case of
statically compiled programs, it is often restricted to optimizations for a
specific dataset and may not be applicable to applications that exhibit
different run-time behavior across program phases, multiple datasets or when
executed in heterogeneous, reconfigurable and virtual environments. Several
frameworks have been recently introduced to tackle these problems and enable
run-time optimization and adaptation for statically compiled programs based on
static function multiversioning and monitoring of online program behavior. In
this article, we present a novel technique to select a minimal set of
representative optimization variants (function versions) for such frameworks
while avoiding performance loss across available datasets and code-size
explosion. We developed a novel mapping mechanism using popular decision tree
or rule induction based machine learning techniques to rapidly select best code
versions at run-time based on dataset features and minimize selection overhead.
These techniques enable creation of self-tuning static binaries or libraries
adaptable to changing behavior and environments at run-time using staged
compilation that do not require complex recompilation frameworks while
effectively outperforming traditional single-version non-adaptable code.

torus action on a compact symplectic manifold is a convex polyhedron. Atiyah's
proof makes use of the fact that level sets of the momentum map are connected.
These proofs work in the setting of finite-dimensional compact symplectic
manifolds. One can ask how these results generalize. A well-known example of an
infinite-dimensional symplectic manifold with a finite-dimensional torus action
is the based loop group. Atiyah and Pressley proved convexity for this example,
but not connectedness of level sets. A proof of connectedness of level sets for
the based loop group was provided by Harada, Holm, Jeffrey and Mare in $2006$.
  In this thesis we study Hilbert manifolds equipped with a strong symplectic
structure and a finite-dimensional group action preserving the strong
symplectic structure. We prove connectedness of regular generic level sets of
the momentum map. We use this to prove convexity of the image of the momentum
map.

framework that enables the construction of robust, scalable workflows for
either generating or processing voluminous datasets. A workflow is created from
user-written Python functions (nodes) connected by 'pipes' (edges) into a
directed acyclic graph. These functions are arbitrarily definable, and can make
use of any Python modules or external binaries. Given a user-defined topology
and collection of input data, functions are composed into nested higher-order
maps, which are transparently and robustly evaluated in parallel on a single
computer or on remote hosts. Local and remote computational resources can be
flexibly pooled and assigned to functional nodes, thereby allowing facile
load-balancing and pipeline optimization to maximize computational throughput.
Input items are processed by nodes in parallel, and traverse the graph in
batches of adjustable size -- a trade-off between lazy-evaluation, parallelism,
and memory consumption. The processing of a single item can be parallelized in
a scatter/gather scheme. The simplicity and flexibility of distributed
workflows using PaPy bridges the gap between desktop -> grid, enabling this new
computing paradigm to be leveraged in the processing of large scientific
datasets.

between nodes with similar attributes. In social networks, for example, links
tend to exist between individuals of similar age, nationality, location, race,
income, educational level, religious belief, and language. Thus, various
attributes jointly affect the network topology. An interesting problem is to
detect community structure beyond some specific assortativity-related
attributes $\rho$, i.e., to take out the effect of $\rho$ on network topology
and reveal the hidden community structure which are due to other attributes. An
approach to this problem is to redefine the null model of the modularity
measure, so as to simulate the effect of $\rho$ on network topology. However, a
challenge is that we do not know to what extent the network topology is
affected by $\rho$ and by other attributes. In this paper, we propose
Dist-Modularity which allows us to freely choose any suitable function to
simulate the effect of $\rho$. Such freedom can help us probe the effect of
$\rho$ and detect the hidden communities which are due to other attributes. We
test the effectiveness of Dist-Modularity on synthetic benchmarks and two

establish conflict-free distributed allocations in a wide range of network
utility maximization problems. A set of agents independently bid on a set of
items, and exchange their bids with their first hop-neighbors for a distributed
(max-consensus) winner determination. The use of MCA protocols was proposed,
$e.g.$, to solve the task allocation problem for a fleet of unmanned aerial
vehicles, in smart grids, or in distributed virtual network management
applications. Misconfigured or malicious agents participating in a MCA, or an
incorrect instantiation of policies can lead to oscillations of the protocol,
causing, $e.g.$, Service Level Agreement (SLA) violations.
  In this paper, we propose a formal, machine-readable, Max-Consensus Auction
model, encoded in the Alloy lightweight modeling language. The model consists
of a network of agents applying the MCA mechanisms, instantiated with
potentially different policies, and a set of predicates to analyze its
convergence properties. We were able to verify that MCA is not resilient
against rebidding attacks, and that the protocol fails (to achieve a
conflict-free resource allocation) for some specific combinations of policies.
Our model can be used to verify, with a ""push-button"" analysis, the convergence
of the MCA mechanism to a conflict-free allocation of a wide range of policy
instantiations.
