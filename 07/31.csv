and homogeneity are accomplished via a specific combination of anisotropic
sources (three scalar fields that individually break isotropy). This results in
specific observational signatures that are not found in standard models of
inflation: a non-trivial angular dependence for the squeezed bispectrum, and a
possibly long period of anisotropic inflation (to drive inflation, the ""solid""
must be very insensitive to any deformation, and thus background anisotropies
are very slowly erased). In this paper we compute the expected level of
statistical anisotropy in the power spectrum of the curvature perturbations of
this model. To do so, we account for the classical background values of the
three scalar fields that are generated on large (superhorizon) scales during
inflation via a random walk sum, as the perturbation modes leave the horizon.
Such an anisotropy is unavoidably generated, even starting from perfectly
isotropic classical initial conditions. The expected level of anisotropy is
related to the duration of inflation and to the amplitude of the squeezed
bispectrum. If this amplitude is close to its current observational limit (so
that one of the most interesting predictions of the model can be observed in
the near future), we find that a level of statistical anisotropy $\gtrsim 3\%$
in the power spectrum is to be expected, if inflation lasted $\gtrsim 20-30$
e-folds more than the final $50-60$ efolds required to generare the CMB modes.
We also comment and point out various similarities between solid inflation and
models of inflation where a suitable coupling of the inflaton to a vector
kinetic term $F^{2}$ gives frozen and scale invariant vector perturbations on
superhorizon scales.

disks. However, the ionization state can depend on the gas dynamics, because
electric fields induced by MHD turbulence can heat up plasmas and thereby
affect the ionization balance. To study this nonlinear feedback, we construct
an ionization model that includes plasma heating by electric fields and impact
ionization by heated electrons, as well as charging of dust grains. We show
that when plasma sticking onto grains is the dominant recombination process,
the electron abundance in the gas decreases with increasing electric field
strength. This is a natural consequence of electron-grain collisions whose
frequency increases with electron's random velocity. The decreasing electron
abundance may lead to a self-regulation of MHD turbulence. In some cases, not
only the electron abundance but also the electric current decreases with
increasing field strength in a certain field range. The resulting N-shaped
current--field relation violates the fundamental assumption of the
non-relativistic MHD that the electric field is uniquely determined by the
current density. At even higher field strengths, impact ionization causes an
abrupt increase of the electric current as expected by previous studies. We
find that this discharge current is multi-valued (i.e., the current--field
relation is S-shaped) under some circumstances, and that the intermediate
branch is unstable. The N/S-shaped current--field relations may yield
hysteresis in the evolution of MHD turbulence in some parts of protoplanetary
disks.

from Solar Dynamics Observatory, Reuven Ramaty High Energy Solar Spectroscopic

triggering and energy release processes of this flare despite its very
impulsive behavior and compact morphology. The flare light curves exhibit an
abrupt rise of non-thermal emission with co-temporal hard X-ray (HXR) and
microwave (MW) bursts that peaked instantly without any precursor emission.
This stage was associated with HXR emission up to 200 keV that followed a power
law with photon spectral index ($\delta$) $\sim$3. Another non-thermal peak,
observed 32 s later, was more pronounced in the MW flux than the HXR profiles.
Dual peaked structure in the MW and HXR light curves suggest a two-step
magnetic reconnection process. Extreme ultraviolet (EUV) images exhibit a
sequential evolution of the inner and outer core regions of magnetic loop
system while the overlying loop configuration remained unaltered. Combined
observations in HXR, (E)UV, and H$\alpha$ provide support for flare models
involving interaction of coronal loops. The magnetograms obtained from
Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) reveal the emergence of magnetic flux
which started $\sim$5 hr before the flare. However, the more crucial changes in
the photospheric magnetic flux occurred about 1 minute prior to the flare onset
with opposite polarity magnetic transients appearing at the early flare
location within the inner core region. The spectral, temporal, and spatial
properties of magnetic transients suggest that the sudden changes in the
small-scale magnetic field have likely triggered the flare by destabilizing the
highly sheared pre-flare magnetic configuration.

as a new class of topological insulators in which non-trivial surface states
reside in the bulk Kondo band gap at low temperature due to the strong
spin-orbit coupling [1-3]. In contrast to other three-dimensional (3D)
topological insulators (e.g. Bi2Se3), a TKI is truly insulating in the bulk
[4]. Furthermore, strong electron correlations are present in the system, which
may interact with the novel topological phase. Applying spin- and
angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (SARPES) to the Kondo insulator SmB6,
a promising TKI candidate, we reveal that the surface states of SmB6 are spin
polarized, and the spin is locked to the crystal momentum. Counter-propagating
states (i.e. at k and -k) have opposite spin polarizations protected by
time-reversal symmetry. Together with the odd number of Fermi surfaces of
surface states between the 4 time-reversal invariant momenta in the surface
Brillouin zone [5], these findings prove, for the first time, that SmB6 can
host non-trivial topological surface states in a full insulating gap in the
bulk stemming from the Kondo effect. Hence our experimental results establish
that SmB6 is the first realization of a 3D TKI. It can also serve as an ideal
platform for the systematic study of the interplay between novel topological
quantum states with emergent effects and competing order induced by strongly
correlated electrons.

by a large international collaboration (Italy, Germany, Czech Repubblic,
Slovenia, Brazil) in response to the 2012 ESA call for a small mission
opportunity for a launch in 2017 and presently under further investigation for
subsequent opportunities. The general scientific objective is to perform
measurements of key importance for GRB science and to provide the wide
astrophysical community of an advanced X-ray all-sky monitoring system. The
proposed payload was based on silicon drift detectors (~1-50 keV), CdZnTe (CZT)
detectors (~15-200 keV) and crystal scintillators in phoswich (NaI/CsI)
configuration (~20 keV-20 MeV), three well established technologies, for a
total weight of ~250 kg and a required power of ~240 W. Such instrumentation
allows a unique, unprecedented and very powerful combination of large field of
view (3-4 sr), a broad energy energy band extending from ~1 keV up to ~20 MeV,
an energy resolution as good as ~300 eV in the 1-30 keV energy range, a source
location accuracy of ~1 arcmin. The mission profile included a launch (e.g., by
Vega) into a low Earth orbit, a baseline sky scanning mode plus pointed
observations of regions of particular interest, data transmission to ground via
X-band (4.8 Gb/orbit, Alcantara and Malindi ground stations), and prompt
transmission of GRB / transient triggers.

By changing
a single Verblunsky coefficient a full-line CMV matrix can be decoupled and
written as the sum of two half-line operators. Explicit formulas for the
scattering matrix associated to the coupled and decoupled operators are
derived. In particular, it is shown that a CMV matrix is reflectionless iff the
scattering matrix is off-diagonal which in turn provides a short proof of an
important result of [Breuer-Ryckman-Simon]. These developments parallel those

the two ensembles. The absence of inter-cloud dipolar spin-exchange processes
reveals a classical behavior, in contrast to previous results with atoms loaded

spin-exchange dynamics due to contact interactions which enable the first

dynamics, its holographic mapping to gravity in a higher-dimensional anti-de
Sitter (AdS) space, and conformal quantum mechanics. This approach provides new
insights into the origin of a fundamental mass scale and the physics underlying
confinement dynamics in QCD in the limit of massless quarks. The result is a
relativistic light-front wave equation for arbitrary spin with an effective
confinement potential derived from a conformal action and its embedding in AdS
space. This equation allows for the computation of essential features of hadron
spectra in terms of a single scale. The light-front holographic methods
described here gives a precise interpretation of holographic variables and
quantities in AdS in terms of light-front variables and quantum numbers. This
leads to a relation between the AdS wave functions and the boost-invariant
light-front wave functions describing the internal structure of hadronic bound
states in physical space-time. The pion is massless in the chiral limit and the
excitation spectra of relativistic light-quark meson and baryon bound states
lie on linear Regge trajectories with identical slopes in the radial and
orbital quantum numbers. In the light-front holographic approach described here
currents are expressed as an infinite sum of poles, and form factors as a
product of poles. At large $q^2$ the form factor incorporates the correct
power-law fall-off for hard scattering independent of the specific dynamics and
is dictated by the twist. At low $q^2$ the form factor leads to vector
dominance. The approach is also extended to include small quark masses. We
briefly review in this report other holographic approaches to QCD, in
particular top-down and bottom-up models based on chiral symmetry breaking. We
also include a discussion of open problems and future applications.

attacks or the carrier of unwanted messages, such as spam. Nevertheless,
crawlers and software agents are a precious tool for analysts, and they are
continuously executed to collect data or to test distributed applications.
However, no one knows which is the real potential of a bot whose purpose is to
control a community, to manipulate consensus, or to influence user behavior. It
is commonly believed that the better an agent simulates human behavior in a
social network, the more it can succeed to generate an impact in that
community. We contribute to shed light on this issue through an online social
experiment aimed to study to what extent a bot with no trust, no profile, and
no aims to reproduce human behavior, can become popular and influential in a
social media. Results show that a basic social probing activity can be used to
acquire social relevance on the network and that the so-acquired popularity can
be effectively leveraged to drive users in their social connectivity choices.
We also register that our bot activity unveiled hidden social polarization
patterns in the community and triggered an emotional response of individuals
that brings to light subtle privacy hazards perceived by the user base.

of minimal volume, namely, the minimal volume of a manifold $M^n$ is defined to
be the greatest lower bound of the total volumes of $M^n$ with respect to
complete Riemannian metrics whose sectional curvature is bounded above in
absolute value by 1. While the minimal curvature, introduced by G. Yun in 1996,
is the smallest pinching of the sectional curvature among metrics of volume 1.
The goal of this article is to provide estimates to minimal volume and minimal

investigating the fundamental principles of developmental gene interactions.
The gene expression patterns of \textit{Drosophila melanogaster} can be
documented as digital images, which are annotated with anatomical ontology
terms to facilitate pattern discovery and comparison. The automated annotation
of gene expression pattern images has received increasing attention due to the
recent expansion of the image database. The effectiveness of gene expression
pattern annotation relies on the quality of feature representation. Previous
studies have demonstrated that sparse coding is effective for extracting
features from gene expression images. However, solving sparse coding remains a
computationally challenging problem, especially when dealing with large-scale
data sets and learning large size dictionaries. In this paper, we propose a
novel algorithm to solve the sparse coding problem, called Stochastic
Coordinate Coding (SCC). The proposed algorithm alternatively updates the
sparse codes via just a few steps of coordinate descent and updates the
dictionary via second order stochastic gradient descent. The computational cost
is further reduced by focusing on the non-zero components of the sparse codes
and the corresponding columns of the dictionary only in the updating procedure.
Thus, the proposed algorithm significantly improves the efficiency and the
scalability, making sparse coding applicable for large-scale data sets and
large dictionary sizes. Our experiments on Drosophila gene expression data sets
demonstrate the efficiency and the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

of inertia tensor plays a central role, whereas the latter is shown to be a far

probing the properties of the quark-gluon plasma. It is therefore crucial to
understand the background - soft photons produced in elementary collisions. Low
theorem states that soft photon production in hadron collisions is dominated by
Bremsstrahlung off charged initial and final state hadrons. Surprisingly,
almost every experiment observed an enhancement (by a factor of $2\div 5$)
above Low theorem's prediction. This is the longstanding puzzle of ""anomalous
soft photon production."" The phenomenon is not observed in processes with
leptonic final states, which suggests that the mechanism is due to
nonperturbative QCD evolution. We study this phenomenon using an exactly
soluble, massless, Abelian model in $1+1$ dimensions which shares with QCD many
important properties: confinement, chiral symmetry breaking, axial anomaly and
$\theta$-vacuum. We then apply this model to the soft photon production in the
fragmentation of jets produced in $Z^0$ decays and find a qualitative agreement
with the data.

a valuable tool to analyze lattice QCD correlation functions in external

argue, however, that the most desirable approach is a hybrid one, which
combines a relativistic hadron theory with operator selection based on
nonrelativistic QED power counting. In this hybrid framework, new results are
obtained for charged spin-half hadrons in uniform magnetic fields, including a
proper treatment of Landau levels both in infinite volume and on a torus.

Non-conserved currents are dual to massive vector fields in AdS. We introduce
the mass in a gauge invariant way via the St\""uckelberg mechanism. In
particular we find generalizations of the Chiral Magnetic Effect, the Chiral
Separation Effect and the Chiral Magnetic Wave. Since the associated charge is
not conserved we need to source it explicitly by a coupling, the generalization
of the chemical potential. In this setup we find that in general the anomalous
transport phenomena are still realized. The values we find for non-zero mass
connect however continuously to the values of the anomalous conductivities of
the consistent currents. i.e. the proper chiral magnetic effect vanishes for
all masses (as it does for the consistent current in the zero mass case)
whereas the chiral separation effect is fully present. The generalization of
the chiral magnetic wave shows that for small momenta there is no propagating
wave but two purely absorptive modes (one of them diffusive). At higher momenta
we recover the chiral magnetic wave as a combination of the two absorptive
modes. We also study the negative magneto resistivity and find that it grows
quadratically with the magnetic field. Since the (classical) $U(1)_A$ symmetry
of QCD is not at all a symmetry at the quantum level we also argue that using
massive vectors in AdS to model the axial singlet current might result in a
more realistic holographic model of QCD and should be a good starting point to

ultra-cold atomic gases with strong short-range interactions between atoms with
different spins, which can be described using Tan's contact, are dominated by
short range pairs of different fermions and decreases as $k^{-4}$. In atomic
nuclei the momentum distribution of nucleons above the Fermi momentum ($k>k_F
\approx 250$ Mev/c) is also dominated by short rangecorrelated
different-fermion (neutron-proton) pairs.
  Purpose: Compare high-momentum unlike-fermion momentum distributions in
atomic and nuclear systems.
  Methods: We show that, for $k>k_F$ MeV/c, nuclear momentum distributions are
proportional to that of the deuteron. We then examine the deuteron momentum
distributions derived from a wide variety of modern nucleon-nucleon potentials
that are consistent with $NN$-scattering data.
  Results: The high momentum tail of the deuteron momentum distribution, and
hence of the nuclear momentum distributions appears to decrease as $k^{-4}$.
This behavior is shown to arise from the effects of the tensor part of the
nucleon-nucleon potential. In addition, when the dimensionless interaction
strength for the atomic system is chosen to be similar to that of atomic
nuclei, the probability for finding a short range different-fermion pair in
both systems is the same.
  Conclusions: Although nuclei do not satisfy all of the conditions for Tan's
contact, the observed similarity of the magnitude and $k^{-4}$ shape of nuclear
and atomic momentum distributions is remarkable because these systems differ by
about $20$ orders of magnitude in density. This similarity may lead to a
greater understanding of nuclei and the density dependence of nuclear systems.

possess the unexpected property that their dwarf satellite galaxies are aligned

diametrically opposed galaxy satellites provides a means to determine
statistically the prevalence of kinematically coherent planar alignments. In
the local universe (redshift $z<0.05$), we find that such satellite pairs out
to a galactocentric distance of $150$ kpc are preferentially anti-correlated in
their velocities (99.994% confidence level), and that the distribution of
galaxies in the larger scale environment (beyond 150 kpc and up to $\approx 2$
Mpc) is strongly elongated along the axis joining the inner satellite pair
($>7\sigma$ confidence). Our finding may indicate that co-rotating planes of
satellites, similar to that seen around the Andromeda galaxy, are ubiquitous in
nature, while their coherent motion also suggests that they are a significant
repository of angular momentum on $\sim 100$ kpc scales.

With a sample of more than 11,000 X-ray point sources, we are able to measure,
for the first time, evidence for evolution in the cluster AGN population beyond
the expected evolution of field AGN. Our analysis shows that overall number
density of cluster AGN scales with the cluster mass as $\sim M_{500}^{-1.2}$.
There is no evidence for the overall number density of cluster member X-ray AGN
depending on the cluster redshift in a manner different than field AGN, nor
there is any evidence that the spatial distribution of cluster AGN (given in
units of the cluster overdensity radius r_500) strongly depends on the cluster
mass or redshift. The $M^{-1.2 \pm 0.7}$ scaling relation we measure is
consistent with theoretical predictions of the galaxy merger rate in clusters,
which is expected to scale with the cluster velocity dispersion, $\sigma$, as $
\sim \sigma^{-3}$ or $\sim M^{-1}$. This consistency suggests that AGN in
clusters may be predominantly triggered by galaxy mergers, a result that is
further corroborated by visual inspection of Hubble images for 23
spectroscopically confirmed cluster member AGN in our sample. A merger-driven
scenario for the triggering of X-ray AGN is not strongly favored by studies of
field galaxies, however, suggesting that different mechanisms may be primarily

optimization problems by slowly changing the Hamiltonian of a quantum system.
The evolution time necessary for the algorithm to be successful scales
inversely with the minimum energy gap encountered during the dynamics.
Unfortunately, the direct calculation of the gap is strongly limited by the
exponential growth in the dimensionality of the Hilbert space associated to the
quantum system. Although many special-purpose methods have been devised to
reduce the effective dimensionality, they are strongly limited to particular
classes of problems with evident symmetries. Moreover, little is known about
the computational power of adiabatic quantum optimizers in real-world

this method, we are able to analyze the performance of ""non-ideal"" quantum
adiabatic optimizers to solve the well-known Grover problem, namely the search
of target entries in an unsorted database, in the presence of discrete local
defects. In this case, we show that adiabatic quantum optimization, even if

at this epoch, containing the progenitors of more massive SGs on which the bulk
of the size-evolution literature is based. We visually split our SGs into
systems that are relaxed and those that exhibit tidal features indicative of a
recent merger. Numerical simulations indicate that, given the depth of our
images, only tidal features due to major mergers will be detectable at these
epochs (features from minor mergers being too faint), making the disturbed SGs
a useful route for estimating major-merger-driven size growth. The disturbed
SGs are offset in size from their relaxed counterparts, lying close to the
upper envelope of the local size -- mass relation. The mean size ratio of the
disturbed SGs to their relaxed counterparts is ~2. Combining this observed size
growth with empirical major-merger histories from the literature suggests that
the size evolution of a significant fraction (around two-thirds) of SGs in this
mass range could be driven by major mergers. If, as is likely, our galaxies are
progenitors of more massive M > 10^10.7 MSun SGs at z<1, then major mergers are

is possible to rapidly compute the feature selection path described by the
posterior probabilities as a function of the L2 penalty. We present simulations

completely positive (cp) maps play a central role: unital cp maps in the case
of matrix convex sets and trace preserving cp (CPTP) maps in the case of
contractively tracial convex sets. CPTP maps, also known as quantum channels,
are fundamental objects in quantum information theory.
  Free convexity is intimately connected with Linear Matrix Inequalities (LMIs)
L(x) = A_0 + A_1 x_1 + ... + A_g x_g > 0 and their matrix convex solution sets
{ X : L(X) is positive semidefinite }, called free spectrahedra. The
Effros-Winkler Hahn-Banach Separation Theorem for matrix convex sets states
that matrix convex sets are solution sets of LMIs with operator coefficients.
Motivated in part by cp interpolation problems, we develop the foundations of
convex analysis and duality in the tracial setting, including tracial analogs
of the Effros-Winkler Theorem.
  The projection of a free spectrahedron in g+h variables to g variables is a
matrix convex set called a free spectrahedrop. As a class, free spectrahedrops
are more general than free spectrahedra, but at the same time more tractable
than general matrix convex sets. Moreover, many matrix convex sets can be
approximated from above by free spectrahedrops. Here a number of fundamental
results for spectrahedrops and their polar duals are established. For example,
the free polar dual of a free spectrahedrop is again a free spectrahedrop. We
also give a Positivstellensatz for free polynomials that are positive on a free
spectrahedrop.

classical-quantum channels with a discrete input alphabet and a finite
dimensional output, possibly under additional constraints on the input

and lower bounds for the capacity. To provide an $\varepsilon$-close estimate
to the capacity, the presented algorithm requires $O(\tfrac{(N \vee M) M^3
\log(N)^{1/2}}{\varepsilon})$, where $N$ denotes the input alphabet size and
$M$ the output dimension. We then generalize the method for the task of
approximating the capacity of classical-quantum channels with a bounded
continuous input alphabet and a finite dimensional output. For channels with a
finite dimensional quantum mechanical input and output, the idea of a universal
encoder allows us to approximate the Holevo capacity using the same method. In
particular, we show that the problem of approximating the Holevo capacity can
be reduced to a multidimensional integration problem. For families of quantum
channels fulfilling a certain assumption we show that the complexity to derive
an $\varepsilon$-close solution to the Holevo capacity is subexponential or
even polynomial in the problem size. We provide several examples to illustrate
the performance of the approximation scheme in practice.

current physical relevance, and we rigorously show that TQLs obey an area law.
Fourth, we show that all topological quantum liquids have MERA representations
which achieve unit overlap with the ground state in the thermodynamic limit and
which have a bond dimension scaling with system size $L$ as $e^{c
\log^{d(1+\delta)}(L)}$ for all $\delta >0$. For example, we show that chiral

three-point correlation, or bispectrum, between one gravitational-wave (tensor)
mode and two density-perturbation (scalar) modes. This tensor-scalar-scalar
correlation leads to a local power quadrupole, an apparent departure from
statistical isotropy in our Universe, as well as characteristic four-point
correlations in the current mass distribution in the Universe. So far, the
predictions for these observables have been worked out only for single-clock
models in which certain consistency conditions between the tensor-scalar-scalar
correlation and tensor and scalar power spectra are satisfied. Here we review
the requirements on inflation models for these consistency conditions to be
satisfied. We then consider several examples of inflation models, such as
non-attractor and solid inflation models, in which these conditions are put to
the test. In solid inflation the simplest consistency conditions are already
violated whilst in the non-attractor model we find that, contrary to the
standard scenario, the tensor-scalar-scalar correlator probes directly relevant
model-dependent information. We work out the predictions for observables in
these models. For non-attractor inflation we find an apparent local quadrupolar
departure from statistical isotropy in large-scale structure but that this
power quadrupole decreases very rapidly at smaller scales. The consistency of
the CMB quadrupole with statistical isotropy then constrains the distance scale
that corresponds to the transition from the non-attractor to attractor phase of
inflation to be larger than the currently observable horizon. Solid inflation
predicts clustering fossils signatures in the current galaxy distribution that
may be large enough to be detectable with forthcoming, and possibly even
current, galaxy surveys.

planets orbiting close to their host stars suggests significant orbital
migration. There is currently no consensus on what produces such orbits.
Theoretical explanations often invoke interactions with a binary companion star
on an orbit that is inclined relative to the planet's orbital plane. Such
mechanisms require significant mutual inclinations between planetary and binary
star orbital planes. The protoplanetary disks in a few young binaries are
misaligned, but these measurements are sensitive only to a small portion of the
inner disk, and the three-dimensional misalignment of the bulk of the
planet-forming disk mass has hitherto not been determined. Here we report that
the protoplanetary disks in the young binary system HK Tau are misaligned by
60{\deg}-68{\deg}, so one or both disks are significantly inclined to the

these conditions are present at the time of planet formation, apparently due to

inhabiting group-sized halos. This is done through the study of the evolution
of the Infra-Red (IR) luminosity function of group galaxies from redshift 0 to
~1.6. We use a sample of 39 X-ray selected groups in the Extended Chandra Deep
Field South (ECDFS), the Chandra Deep Field North (CDFN), and the COSMOS field,
where the deepest available mid- and far-IR surveys have been conducted with
Spitzer MIPS and Hersche PACS. Groups at low redshift lack the brightest,
rarest, and most star forming IR-emitting galaxies observed in the field. Their
IR-emitting galaxies contribute <10% of the comoving volume density of the
whole IR galaxy population in the local Universe. At redshift >~1, the most
IR-luminous galaxies (LIRGs and ULIRGs) are preferentially located in groups,
and this is consistent with a reversal of the star-formation rate vs .density
anti-correlation observed in the nearby Universe. At these redshifts, group
galaxies contribute 60-80% of the CSFH, i.e. much more than at lower redshifts.
Below z~1, the comoving number and SFR densities of IR-emitting galaxies in
groups decline significantly faster than those of all IR-emitting galaxies. Our
results are consistent with a ""halo downsizing"" scenario and highlight the
significant role of ""environment"" quenching in shaping the CSFH.

during the observation, with the variability concentrated at low energies,
which suggesting either a relativistic reflection or a variable absorption
scenario. In this work we focus on the reflection interpretation, making use of
new relativistic reflection models that self consistently calculate the
reflection fraction, relativistic blurring and angle-dependent reflection
spectrum for different coronal heights to model the spectra. We find that the
spectra can be well fit with relativistic reflection, and that the lowest flux
state spectrum is described by reflection alone, suggesting the effects of
extreme light-bending occurring within ~2 gravitational radii of the event
horizon. The reflection fraction decreases sharply with increasing flux,
consistent with a point source moving up to above 10 Rg as the source
brightens. We constrain the spin parameter to greater than 0.9 at the 3 sigma
confidence level. By adding a spin-dependent upper limit on the reflection
fraction to our models, we demonstrate that this can be a powerful way of
constraining the spin parameter, particularly in reflection dominated states.

that it closely matches theoretical predictions for a compact source within a

this work we incorporate anomalous diffusion in a previously developed model
for FRAP experiments. Our particular implementation of subdiffusive transport
is based on a continuous time random walk (CTRW) description of the motion of
fluorescent particles, as CTRWs lend themselves particularly well to the
inclusion of binding/unbinding events. In order to model switching between
bound and unbound states of fluorescent subdiffusive particles, we derive a
fractional reaction-subdiffusion equation of rather general applicability.
Using suitable initial and boundary conditions, this equation is then
incorporated in the model describing two-dimensional kinetics of FRAP
experiments. We find that this model can be used to obtain excellent fits to
experimental data. Moreover, recovery curves corresponding to different radii
of the circular bleach spot can be fitted by a single set of parameters. While
not enough evidence has been collected to claim with certainty that CTRW is the
underlying transport mechanism in FRAP experiments, the compatibility of our
results with experimental data fuels the discussion as to whether normal
diffusion or anomalous diffusion is the appropriate model, and as to whether
anomalous diffusion effects are important to fully understand the outcomes of
FRAP experiments. On a more technical side, we derive explicit analytic

Universe is a dramatic drop of the star formation (SF) activity, since z~1. In
this work we investigate if the very same process of assembly and growth of
structures is one of the major drivers of the observed decline. We study the
contribution to the CSFH of galaxies in halos of different masses. This is done
by studying the total SFR-halo mass-redshift plane from redshift 0 to redshift
z~1.6 in a sample of 57 groups and clusters by using the deepest available mid-
and far-infrared surveys conducted with Spitzer MIPS and Herschel PACS and
SPIRE. Our results show that low mass groups provide a 60-80% contribution to
the CSFH at z~1. Such contribution declines faster than the CSFH in the last 8
billion years to less than 10% at z<0.3, where the overall SF activity is
sustained by lower mass halos. More massive systems provide only a marginal
contribution (<10%) at any epoch. A simplified abundance matching method shows
that the large contribution of low mass groups at z~1 is due to a large
fraction (>50%) of very massive, highly star forming Main Sequence galaxies.
Below z~1 a quenching process must take place in massive halos to cause the
observed faster suppression of their SF activity. Such process must be a slow
one though, as most of the models implementing a rapid quenching of the SF
activity in accreting satellites significantly underpredicts the observed SF
level in massive halos at any redshift. Starvation or the transition from cold
to hot accretion would provide a quenching timescale of 1 Gyrs more consistent
with the observations. Our results suggest a scenario in which, due to the
structure formation process, more and more galaxies experience the group
environment and, thus, the associated quenching process. This leads to the
progressive suppression of their SF activity shaping the CSFH below z~1.

random pure states for varying N, assuming the conjectured optimal measurement
operators. It is seen that for small N the Bell inequality is not violated on
average, while for larger N it is. Both ensembles of unstructured as well as
structured random pure states are considered. Using techniques from random

numerically for intermediate N. The results show a beautiful interplay of
different aspects of random matrix theory, ranging from the Marchenko-Pastur

attention-demanding state, and two memory-demanding states. Using the formalism
of hypergraphs, we identify the presence of groups of functional interactions
that fluctuate coherently in strength over time both within (task-specific) and
across (task-general) brain states. In contrast to prior emphases on the
complexity of many dyadic (region-to-region) relationships, these results
demonstrate that brain adapt- ability can be described by common processes that
drive the dynamic integration of cognitive systems. Moreover, our results
establish the hypergraph as an effective measure for understanding functional
brain dynamics, which may also prove useful in examining cross-task, cross-age,

networks are becoming increasingly dense and heterogeneous. Dense deployments
are expected to provide a linear capacity scaling with the number of small

is severely limited in dense networks due to interference. The primary reason
is that the current LTE control plane deployment model has very high latency
and is unable to cope with the demand of implementing interference management
techniques that require coordination on a millisecond timeframe.
  This paper presents SwiftC, a novel low-latency control plane design for LTE
networks. SwiftC's novel contribution is a design for efficiently sending and
receiving control plane messages over the LTE spectrum itself, thus creating a
direct and low-latency coordination signaling link between small cells and the
macrocell. SwiftC builds on recent work in full duplex radios and shows via
prototype implementations that a low latency control plane can be built over
the existing LTE network without wasting licensed spectrum. We also show the
benefits of SwiftC in implementing complex interference management techniques,
and show that with SwiftC small cell deployments can achieve almost a linear
capacity scaling with every small cell deployed.

engineering applications. They may be inherent to the problem---e.g., in
determining the relationship between genetics and the presence or absence of a
disease---or they may be a result of extreme quantization. In one-bit
compressed sensing it has recently been shown that the number of one-bit
measurements required for signal estimation mirrors that of unquantized
compressed sensing. Indeed, $s$-sparse signals in $\mathbb{R}^n$ can be
estimated (up to normalization) from $\Omega(s \log (n/s))$ one-bit
measurements. Nevertheless, controlling the precise accuracy of the error
estimate remains an open challenge. In this paper, we focus on optimizing the
decay of the error as a function of the oversampling factor $\lambda := m/(s
\log(n/s))$, where $m$ is the number of measurements. It is known that the
error in reconstructing sparse signals from standard one-bit measurements is
bounded below by $\Omega(\lambda^{-1})$. Without adjusting the measurement
procedure, reducing this polynomial error decay rate is impossible. However, we
show that an adaptive choice of the thresholds used for quantization may lower
the error rate to $e^{-\Omega(\lambda)}$. This improves upon guarantees for
other methods of adaptive thresholding as proposed in Sigma-Delta quantization.
We develop a general recursive strategy to achieve this exponential decay and
two specific polynomial-time algorithms which fall into this framework, one
based on convex programming and one on hard thresholding. This work is inspired
by the one-bit compressed sensing model, in which the engineer controls the
measurement procedure. Nevertheless, the principle is extendable to signal
reconstruction problems in a variety of binary statistical models as well as
statistical estimation problems like logistic regression.

propagation through a massive star. We present two-dimensional axisymmetric
hydrodynamical simulations which start from a collapsar engine and evolve all
the way through the late afterglow phase. The resultant outflow includes a jet
core which is highly relativistic after breaking out of the star, but becomes
baryon-loaded after colliding with a massive outer shell, corresponding to mass
from the stellar atmosphere of the progenitor star which became trapped in
front of the jet core at breakout. The prompt emission produced before or
during this collision would then have the signature of a high Lorentz factor
jet, but the afterglow is produced by the amalgamated post-collision ejecta
which has more inertia than the original highly relativistic jet core and thus
has a delayed deceleration. This naturally explains the early light curve
behavior discovered by Swift, including a steep decay and a long plateau,
without invoking late-time energy injection from the central engine. The
numerical simulation is performed continuously from engine to afterglow,
covering a dynamic range of over ten orders of magnitude in radius. Light
curves calculated from the numerical output demonstrate that this mechanism
reproduces basic features seen in early afterglow data. Initial steep decays
are produced by internal shocks, and the plateau corresponds to the coasting
phase of the outflow.

currents. Channels switch between 'open' or 'closed' states in a spontaneous
stochastic process called gating. Currents are either (nearly) zero or at a
definite level, characteristic of each type of protein, independent of time,
once the channel is open. The steady state Poisson-Nernst-Planck equations with
steric effects (PNP-steric equations) describe steady current through the open
channel quite well, in a wide variety of conditions. Here we study the
existence of multiple solutions of steady state PNP-steric equations to see if
they themselves, without modification or augmentation, can describe two levels
of current. We prove that there are two steady state solutions of PNP-steric
equations for (a) three types of ion species (two types of cations and one type
of anion) with a positive constant permanent charge, and (b) four types of ion
species (two types of cations and their counter-ions) with a constant permanent
charge but no sign condition. The excess currents (due to steric effects)
associated with these two steady state solutions are derived and expressed as
two distinct formulas. Our results indicate that PNP-steric equations may
become a useful model to study spontaneous gating of ion channels. Spontaneous
gating is thought to involve small structural changes in the channel protein
that perhaps produce large changes in the profiles of free energy that
determine ion flow. Gating is known to be modulated by external structures.
Both can be included in future extensions of our present analysis.

as an interesting source of gravitational waves. In this chapter we present
estimates of the gravitational wave emission for various scenarios, given the
(electromagnetically) observed characteristics of these systems. First of all
we focus on the r-mode instability and show that a 'minimal' neutron star model
(which does not incorporate exotica in the core, dynamically important magnetic
fields or superfluid degrees of freedom), is not consistent with observations.
We then present estimates of both thermally induced and magnetically sustained
mountains in the crust. In general magnetic mountains are likely to be
detectable only if the buried magnetic field of the star is of the order of
$B\approx 10^{12}$ G. In the thermal mountain case we find that gravitational
wave emission from persistent systems may be detected by ground based
interferometers. Finally we re-asses the idea that gravitational wave emission
may be balancing the accretion torque in these systems, and show that in most
cases the disc/magnetosphere interaction can account for the observed spin
periods.

  propagation",,,,,"physics.ao-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Motivated by the discrepancy between satellite observations of coherent
westward propagating surface features and Rossby wave theory, this paper
revisits the planetary wave propagation problem, taking into account the
effects of lateral buoyancy gradients at the ocean's surface. The standard
theory for long baroclinic Rossby waves is based on an expansion of the
quasigeostrophic stretching operator in normal modes, $\phi_n(z)$, satisfying a
Neumann boundary condition at the surface, $\phi_n'(0) = 0$. Buoyancy gradients
are, by thermal wind balance, proportional to the vertical derivative of the
streamfunction, thus such modes are unable to represent ubiquitous lateral
buoyancy gradients in the ocean's mixed layer. Here, we re-derive the wave
propagation problem in terms of an expansion in a recently-developed
""surface-aware"" (SA) basis that can account for buoyancy anomalies at the
ocean's surface. The problem is studied in the context of an idealized
Charney-like baroclinic wave problem set in an oceanic context, where a surface
mean buoyancy gradient interacts with a constant interior potential vorticity
gradient that results from both $\beta$ and the curvature of the mean shear.
The wave frequencies, growth rates and phases are systematically compared to
those computed from a two-layer model, a truncated expansion in standard
baroclinic modes and to a high-vertical resolution calculation that represents
the true solution. The full solution generally shows faster wave propagation
when lateral surface gradients are present. Moreover, the wave problem in the
SA basis best captures the full solution, even with just a two or three modes.

models accurately capture the full event kinematics, and the dependence on all
masses and couplings can be systematically studied. The interpretation of
mono-jet searches in this framework can be used to establish an equal-footing
comparison with direct detection experiments. For theories with a vector
mediator, LHC mono-jet searches possess better sensitivity than direct
detection searches for light DM masses (less than 5 GeV). For axial-vector
mediators, LHC and direct detection searches generally probe orthogonal
directions in the parameter space. We explore the projected limits of these
searches from the ultimate reach of the LHC and multi-ton xenon direct
detection experiments, and find that the complementarity of the searches
remains. Finally, we provide a comparison of limits in the MSDM and effective
field theory (EFT) frameworks to highlight the deficiencies of the EFT

which the Born probability rule has a dynamical origin. The large-scale power
deficit could arise from incomplete relaxation for the amplitudes of the
primordial perturbations. We show, by numerical simulations for a spectator
scalar field, that if the pre-inflationary era is radiation dominated then the
deficit in the emerging power spectrum will have a characteristic shape (an
inverse-tangent dependence on wavenumber k, with oscillations). It is found
that our scenario is able to produce a power deficit in the observed region and
of the observed (approximate) magnitude for an appropriate choice of
cosmological parameters. We also discuss the large-scale anisotropy, which

linearized coupled-cluster method was used for Ag-like ion calculations, and a
hybrid approach that combines configuration interaction and a variant of the
coupled-cluster method was used for the In-like ion calculations. Breit and QED
corrections were included. Energies, transition wavelengths, electric-dipole,
electric-quadrupole, electric-octupole, magnetic-dipole, magnetic-quadrupole,
magnetic-octupole reduced matrix elements, lifetimes, and sensitivity
coefficients to $\alpha$-variation were calculated. Detailed study of various
contributions was carried out to evaluate uncertainties of the final results.
Energies for several similar ""reference"" ions, where the experimental values
are available were calculated and compared with experiment for further tests of
the accuracy.

holographic principle where neither is the bulk space-time required to be
asymptotically AdS nor the boundary to be located at conformal infinity,
echoing Wilson's formulation of quantum field theory. After showing the general
equilibrium thermodynamics from the corresponding holographic dictionary, in
particular, we provide a rather general proof of the equality between the
entropy production on the boundary and the increase of black hole entropy in
the bulk, which can be regarded as strong support to this holographic

temperatures for Charge-Coupled Device (CCD) images when dark frames cannot be
obtained on the telescope. For images taken with the Antarctic Survey
Telescopes (AST3) in 2012, due to the low cooling efficiency, the median CCD
temperature was -46$^\circ$C, resulting in a high dark current level of about
3$e^-$/pix/sec, even comparable to the sky brightness (10$e^-$/pix/sec). If not
corrected, the nonuniformity of the dark current could even overweight the
photon noise of the sky background. However, dark frames could not be obtained
during the observing season because the camera was operated in frame-transfer
mode without a shutter, and the telescope was unattended in winter. Here we
present an alternative, but simple and effective method to derive the dark
current frame from the scientific images. Then we can scale this dark frame to
the temperature at which the scientific images were taken, and apply the dark
frame corrections to the scientific images. We have applied this method to the
AST3 data, and demonstrated that it can reduce the noise to a level roughly as
low as the photon noise of the sky brightness, solving the high noise problem
and improving the photometric precision. This method will also be helpful for
other projects that suffer from similar issues.

progress increasing with signal level. In this work we investigate the
nonlinear PTC based on the images with a STA1600FT CCD camera, whose PTC starts
to become nonlinear at about 1/3 full well. To explain the phenomenon, we
present a model to characterize the charge-sharing PSF. This signal-dependent

there exists a qualitative change in the thermalization dynamics as the
interaction is varied in the weak-coupling regime. On the weaker interaction
side of this crossover, the phonon oscillations are damped more rapidly than
the electron thermalization timescale, as determined from the relaxation of the
electron momentum distribution function. On the stronger interaction side, the
relaxation of the electrons becomes faster than the phonon damping. In this
regime, despite long-lived phonon oscillations, a thermalized momentum
distribution is realized temporarily. The origin of the thermalization
crossover found here is traced back to different behaviors of the electron and
phonon self-energies as a function of the electron-phonon coupling. In
addition, the importance of the phonon dynamics is demonstrated by comparing
the self-consistent Migdal results with those obtained with a simpler
Hatree-Fock impurity solver that neglects the phonon self-energy. The latter
scheme does not properly describe the evolution and thermalization of isolated

mainly focus on learning kernels by flattening the tensor into vectors or
matrices, however structural information within the tensors will be lost. In
this paper, we introduce a new scheme to design structure-preserving kernels
for supervised tensor learning. Specifically, we demonstrate how to leverage
the naturally available structure within the tensorial representation to encode
prior knowledge in the kernel. We proposed a tensor kernel that can preserve
tensor structures based upon dual-tensorial mapping. The dual-tensorial mapping
function can map each tensor instance in the input space to another tensor in
the feature space while preserving the tensorial structure. Theoretically, our
approach is an extension of the conventional kernels in the vector space to
tensor space. We applied our novel kernel in conjunction with SVM to real-world
tensor classification problems including brain fMRI classification for three
different diseases (i.e., Alzheimer's disease, ADHD and brain damage by HIV).
Extensive empirical studies demonstrate that our proposed approach can
effectively boost tensor classification performances, particularly with small

This paper describes a novel method of hit-position reconstruction based on
sampled signals and an example of an application of the method for a single
module with a 30 cm long plastic strip, read out on both ends by Hamamatsu
R4998 photomultipliers. The sampling scheme to generate a vector with samples
of a PET event waveform with respect to four user-defined amplitudes is
introduced. The experimental setup provides irradiation of a chosen position in
the plastic scintillator strip with an annihilation gamma quanta of energy
511~keV. The statistical test for a multivariate normal (MVN) distribution of
measured vectors at a given position is developed, and it is shown that signals
sampled at four thresholds in a voltage domain are approximately normally
distributed variables. With the presented method of a vector analysis made out
of waveform samples acquired with four thresholds, we obtain a spatial
resolution of about 1 cm and a timing resolution of about 80 ps

the multitude of approaches to achieve scalability topological quantum
computing (TQC) is the most promising one, by being based on an flexible
approach to error-correction and making use of the straightforward
measurement-based computing technique. TQC circuits are defined within a large,
uniform, 3-dimensional lattice of physical qubits produced by the hardware and
the physical volume of this lattice directly relates to the resources required
for computation. Circuit optimization may result in non-intuitive mismatches
between circuit specification and implementation. In this paper we introduce
the first method for cross-level validation of TQC circuits. The specification
of the circuit is expressed based on the stabilizer formalism, and the

field parameters, metallicity) are related to the $F_{8}/F_{24}$ ratio used as
a proxy for the PAH abundance in order to reveal factors that may influence the
PAH evolution in H II complexes. The well-known correlation between the
$F_{8}/F_{24}$ ratio and metallicity is confirmed in the studied complexes. The
infrared flux ratio also correlates with the [O III]$\lambda
5007/\mathrm{H\beta}$ ratio which is often considered as an indicator of the
radiation field hardness, but this correlation seems to be a mere reflection of
a correlation between [O III]$\lambda 5007/\mathrm{H\beta}$ and metallicity. In
separate metallicity bins, the $F_{8}/F_{24}$ ratio is found to correlate with
an age of an H II complex, which is estimated from the equivalent width of

complexes and negative for high metallicity complexes. Analysing various
mechanisms of PAH formation and destruction in the context of found
correlations, we suggest that PAH abundance is likely altered by the UV
radiation within H II complexes, but this is not necessarily due to their
destruction. If PAHs can also form in H II complexes due to some processes like
aromatisation, photodestruction, shattering and sputtering of very small
grains, the net $F_{8}/F_{24}$ ratio is determined by a balance between all
these processes that can be different at different metallicities.

al. motivate the definition of Quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) design sequences for
$\mathbb{W}_p^s(S^d)$, which have previously been introduced only in the
Hilbert space setting $p=2$. We say that a sequence $(X_N)$ of $N$-point

$N^{-s/d}$ as $N \to \infty$, a property that holds, in particular, for a
sequence of spherical $t$-designs in which each design has order $t^d$ points.
For the case $p = 1$, we deduce that any QMC-design sequence $(X_N)$ for
$\mathbb{W}_1^s(S^d)$ with $s > d$ has the optimal covering property; i.e., the
covering radius of $X_N$ has order $N^{-1/d}$ as $N \to \infty$. A significant
portion of our effort is devoted to the formulation of the worst-case error in
terms of a Bessel kernel, and showing that this kernel satisfies a Bernstein

rectagraphs, which are connected triangle-free graphs in which every $2$-arc

$G\leq \mathrm{Aut}(\Gamma)$ such that for each vertex $u$, the permutation
group induced by the vertex stabiliser $G_u$ on the neighbourhood $\Gamma(u)$
is transitive of rank 3. One natural place to seek locally rank 3 graphs is
among the locally triangular graphs, where every induced neighbourhood graph is
isomorphic to a triangular graph $T_n$. This is because the graph $T_n$, which
has vertex set the $2$-subsets of $\{1,\ldots,n\}$ and edge set the pairs of
$2$-subsets intersecting at one point, admits a rank 3 group of automorphisms.

convert heat to work. It is argued here that when using the demon to relate
information to work (Landauer's principle), the demon's goal must be regarded
as an implicit assumption that should not be taken for granted. Other demons
than the standard one can be constructed depending on their assumed goal. When
the demon is purely mechanical, the goal is instilled in it by its design. When
the demon is regarded as ""intelligent"" (Maxwell) and ""endowed with free will""
(Thomson), it is not so clear whence he could acquire a specific goal. A
solution is to subject the demon to evolution by natural selection, which in an
extended form can provide the demon with a genuine goal for which work is
necessary. This implies that the information the demon acquires and uses for
operating the engine becomes functional for the demon, and thereby acquires a
real physical status. Such information, called functional information, applies
to all life and technology. It should be distinguished from the formal,
causally ineffective information that can be defined, more arbitrarily, for any
system. Information in general is not physical, only functional information is.
A similar functional/formal distinction applies to close associates of
information, in particular entropy, probability, and the second law of
thermodynamics.

  2013",,,,"cs.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) is one of the most important tools in digital
signal processing. FFT costs O(N \log N) for transforming a signal of length N.
Recently, Sparse Fourier Transform (SFT) has emerged as a critical issue
addressing how to compute a compressed Fourier transform of a signal with
complexity being related to the sparsity of its spectrum. In this paper, a new
SFT algorithm is proposed for both exactly K-sparse signals (with K non-zero
frequencies) and generally K-sparse signals (with K significant frequencies),
with the assumption that the distribution of the non-zero frequencies is
uniform. The nuclear idea is to downsample the input signal at the beginning;
then, subsequent processing operates under downsampled signals, where signal
lengths are proportional to O(K). Downsampling, however, possibly leads to
""aliasing."" By the shift property of DFT, we recast the aliasing problem as
complex Bose-Chaudhuri-Hocquenghem (BCH) codes solved by syndrome decoding. The
proposed SFT algorithm for exactly K-sparse signals recovers 1-\tau frequencies
with computational complexity O(K \log K) and probability at least
1-O(\frac{c}{\tau})^{\tau K} under K=O(N), where c is a user-controlled
parameter.
  For generally K-sparse signals, due to the fact that BCH codes are sensitive
to noise, we combine a part of syndrome decoding with a compressive
sensing-based solver for obtaining $K$ significant frequencies. The
computational complexity of our algorithm is \max \left( O(K \log K), O(N)
\right), where the Big-O constant of O(N) is very small and only a simple
operation involves O(N). Our simulations reveal that O(N) does not dominate the
computational cost of sFFT-DT.

estimates of the mean molecule numbers and of the variance of fluctuations in
the number of molecules of chemical systems. The advantage of this approach is
that it can be far less computationally expensive than exact stochastic
simulations of the chemical master equation. Here we numerically study the
conditions under which the MA equations yield results reflecting the true
stochastic dynamics of the system. We show that for bistable and oscillatory
chemical systems with deterministic initial conditions, the solution of the MA
equations can be interpreted as a valid approximation to the true moments of
the CME, only when the steady-state mean molecule numbers obtained from the
chemical master equation fall within a certain finite range. The same validity
criterion for monostable systems implies that the steady-state mean molecule
numbers obtained from the chemical master equation must be above a certain
threshold. For mean molecule numbers outside of this range of validity, the MA
equations lead to either qualitatively wrong oscillatory dynamics or to
unphysical predictions such as negative variances in the molecule numbers or
multiple steady-state moments of the stationary distribution as the initial
conditions are varied. Our results clarify the range of validity of the MA
approach and show that pitfalls in the interpretation of the results can only
be overcome through the systematic comparison of the solutions of the MA
equations of a certain order with those of higher orders.

surface energies lead to multiple solutions of the contact angle equation at
contact points. Introduction of a finite contact point mobility is both
physically based and leads to robust, unambiguous determination of the contact
angles. We implement the mathematical model in an explicit finite difference
scheme with cubic spline interpolation for evolving marker points. Following
validation of the mathematical and numerical approaches, we simulate the
evolution of thin film islands, semi-infinite films, and films with holes as a
function of film dimensions, Young's angle $\theta_i$, anisotropy strength and
crystal symmetry, and film crystal orientation relative to the substrate
normal. We find that the contact point retraction rate can be well described by
a power-law, $l \sim t^n$. Our results demonstrate that the exponent $n$ is not
universal -- it is sensitive to the Young's angle $\theta_i$ (and insensitive
to anisotropy). In addition to classical wetting (where holes in a film heal)
and dewetting (where holes in a film grow), we observe cases where a hole
through the film heals but leave a finite size hole/bubble between the
continuous film and substrate or where the hole heals leaving a continuous film
that is not bonded to the substrate. Surface energy anisotropy (i) increases
the instability that leads to island break-up into multiple islands, (ii)
enhances hole healing, and (iii) leads to finite island size even under some
conditions where the Young's angle $\theta_i$ suggests that the film wets the
substrate.

BAO measurements from BOSS DR11, galaxy shear measurements from CFHTLenS, SDSS
Ly-$\alpha$ forest constraints and galaxy cluster mass function from Chandra
observations. To avoid model dependence of the constraints we perform a full
likelihood analysis for all the datasets employed. As for the cluster data
analysis we rely on to the most recent calibration of massive neutrino effects
in the halo mass function and we explore the impact of the uncertainty in the
mass bias and re-calibration of the halo mass function due to baryonic feedback
processes on cosmological parameters. We find that none of the low redshift
probes alone provide evidence for massive neutrinos in combination with CMB
measurements, while a larger than $2\sigma$ detection of non zero neutrino
mass, either active or sterile, is achieved combining cluster or shear data
with CMB and BAO measurements. The preference for massive neutrino is larger in
the sterile neutrino scenario, and for the combination of Planck, BAO, shear

more than $3\sigma$ and a sterile neutrino mass as motivated by accelerator
anomaly is within the $2\sigma$ errors. Finally, results from the full data
combination reflect the tension between the $\sigma_8$ constraints obtained
from cluster and shear data and that inferred from Ly-$\alpha$ forest
measurements; in the active neutrino scenario for both CMB datasets employed,
the full data combination yields only an upper limits on $\sum m_\nu$, while

bandit (CMAB) problems, where subsets of base arms with unknown distributions
form super arms. In each round, a super arm is played and the base arms
contained in the super arm are played and their outcomes are observed. We
further consider the extension in which more based arms could be
probabilistically triggered based on the outcomes of already triggered arms.
The reward of the super arm depends on the outcomes of all played arms, and it
only needs to satisfy two mild assumptions, which allow a large class of
nonlinear reward instances. We assume the availability of an offline
(\alpha,\beta)-approximation oracle that takes the means of the outcome
distributions of arms and outputs a super arm that with probability {\beta}
generates an {\alpha} fraction of the optimal expected reward. The objective of
an online learning algorithm for CMAB is to minimize
(\alpha,\beta)-approximation regret, which is the difference between the
\alpha{\beta} fraction of the expected reward when always playing the optimal
super arm, and the expected reward of playing super arms according to the
algorithm. We provide CUCB algorithm that achieves O(log n)
distribution-dependent regret, where n is the number of rounds played, and we
further provide distribution-independent bounds for a large class of reward
functions. Our regret analysis is tight in that it matches the bound of UCB1
algorithm (up to a constant factor) for the classical MAB problem, and it
significantly improves the regret bound in a earlier paper on combinatorial
bandits with linear rewards. We apply our CMAB framework to two new
applications, probabilistic maximum coverage and social influence maximization,
both having nonlinear reward structures. In particular, application to social
influence maximization requires our extension on probabilistically triggered

relevant to decoherence of a heavy-hole spin qubit in a quantum dot or for a

preparation of the qubit in its non-interacting ground state can actually be
the worst choice to maximize purity. We further give analytical results for
spin-echo envelope modulations of arbitrary spin components of a hole spin in a
quantum dot, going beyond a standard secular approximation. We account for
general dynamics in the presence of a pure-dephasing process and identify a
crossover timescale at which it is again advantageous to initialize the qubit

dynamical decoupling sequence and determine initial conditions that maximize

limitations in dynamic scenarios, due mostly to host mobility. The ICN paradigm
mitigates such problems by releasing the need to have an end-to-end transport
session established during the life time of the data transfer. Moreover, the
ICN concept solves the mismatch between the Internet architecture and the way
users would like to use it: currently a user needs to know the topological
location of the hosts involved in the communication when he/she just wants to
get the data, independently of its location. Most of the research efforts aim
to come up with a stable ICN architecture in fixed networks, with few examples
in ad-hoc and vehicular networks. However, the Internet is becoming more
pervasive with powerful personal mobile devices that allow users to form
dynamic networks in which content may be exchanged at all times and with low
cost. Such pervasive wireless networks suffer with different levels of
disruption given user mobility, physical obstacles, lack of cooperation,
intermittent connectivity, among others. This paper discusses the combination
of content knowledge (e.g., type and interested parties) and social awareness
within opportunistic networking as to drive the deployment of ICN solutions in
disruptive networking scenarios. With this goal in mind, we go over few
examples of social-aware content-based opportunistic networking proposals that
consider social awareness to allow content dissemination independently of the
level of network disruption. To show how much content knowledge can improve
social-based solutions, we illustrate by means of simulation some

complicated dust lane structure of NGC4194 with the brightest emission being
located in an off-nuclear ring-like structure with ~320pc radius, the Eye of
the Medusa. The bulk CO emission of the ring is found south of the kinematical
center of NGC4194. The northern tip of the ring is associated with the galaxy
nucleus, where the radio continuum has its peak. A prominent, secondary
emission maximum in the radio continuum is located inside the molecular ring.
This suggests that the morphology of the ring is partially influenced by
massive supernova explosions. From the combined evidence, we propose that the
Eye of the Medusa contains a shell of swept up material where we identify a
number of giant molecular associations. We propose that the Eye may be the site
of an efficient starburst of 5-7M_sun/yr, but it would still constitute only a
fraction of the 30-50M_sun/yr SFR of NGC4194. Furthermore, we find that ~50% of

decisions between $n\ge 2$ discrete choices. For a special class of
interactions, our model is the mean field description of random-field
Potts-like models, and is effectively solved by finding the extrema of the
average energy $E$ per agent. In these cases, by studying the propagation of
decision changes via avalanches, we argue that macroscopic dynamics is
well-captured by a gradient flow along $E$. We focus on the
permutation-symmetric case, where all $n$ choices are (on average) the same,
and spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) arises purely from cooperative social
interactions. As examples, we show that bimodal heterogeneity naturally
provides a mechanism for the spontaneous formation of hierarchies between
decisions, and that SSB is a preferred instability to discontinuous phase
transitions between two symmetric points. Beyond the mean field limit,
exponentially many stable equilibria emerge when we place this model on a graph
of finite mean degree. We conclude with speculation on decision making with
persistent collective oscillations. Throughout the paper, we emphasize
analogies between methods of solution to our model and common intuition from
diverse areas of physics, including statistical physics and electromagnetism.

accurate displacement measurement devices, is the noise level. The Fabry-Perot
pendulums are the most promising device to detect gravitational waves, and
therefore the background and the internal noise should be accurately measured
and reduced. In fact terminal masses generates additional internal noise mainly
due to thermal fluctuations and vibrations. We propose to exploit the
reflectivity change, that occurs in some special points, to monitor the
pendulums free oscillations and possibly estimate the noise level. We find that
in spite of long transients, it is an effective method for noise estimate. We
also prove that to only retain the sequence of escapes, rather than the whole
time dependent dynamics, entails the main characteristics of the phenomenon.
Escape times could also be relevant for future gravitational wave detector

each vertex receives a (short) label and, the distance between two vertices can
be inferred from their two labels. One such preprocessing problem occurs in the
hub labeling algorithm [Abraham et al., SODA'10]: the label of a vertex v is a
set of vertices x (the ""hubs"") with their distance d(x,v) to v and the distance
between any two vertices u and v is the sum of their distances to a common hub.
The problem of assigning as few such hubs as possible was conjectured to be
NP-hard, but no proof was known to date. We give a reduction from the
well-known Vertex Cover problem on graphs to prove that finding an optimal hub

iteratively estimating, through a pseudo score, the Weibull parameters of

information matrix in the full likelihood specification and by either
calculating bootstrap or robust standard errors for the hybrid pseudo

several modifications of Jackson networks known in the literature, especially
breakdown and repair of nodes with access modification for customers to down
nodes, finite buffers with control of buffer overflow. The rerouting schemes
available in the literature for these situations are special cases of our
rerouting schemes, which can deal also with partial degrading of service
capacities and even with speed up of service.
  In any case we require our algorithms to react on such general changes in the
network with the aim to maintain the utilization of the nodes. To hold this
invariant under change of service speeds (intensities) our algorithms not only
adapt the routing probabilities but decrease automatically the overall arrival
rate to the network if necessary.
  Our main application is for stochastic networks in a random environment. The
impact of the environment on the network is by changing service speeds (by
upgrading and/or degrading, breakdown, repair) and we implement the
randomization algorithms to react to the changes of the environment. On the
other side, customers departing from the network may enforce the environment to
jump immediately. So our environment is not Markov for its own.

the queue lengths vector and the environment which is of product form:

weakly associated at the population level and sparsely distributed across the

Criticism (Tukey [The Higher Criticism (1976) Princeton Univ.]; Donoho and Jin
[Ann. Statist. 32 (2004) 962-994]) to SNP-set analysis of GWAS, and develop a
new theoretical framework in large-scale inference to assess the joint
significance of such rare and weak effects for a quantitative trait. In the
core of our theory is the so-called detection boundary, a curve in the
two-dimensional phase space that quantifies the rarity and strength of genetic
effects. Above the detection boundary, the overall effects of genetic factors
are strong enough for reliable detection. Below the detection boundary, the
genetic factors are simply too rare and too weak for reliable detection. We
show that the HC-type methods are optimal in that they reliably yield detection
once the parameters of the genetic effects fall above the detection boundary

performance of the HC-type approach is demonstrated through simulations and the

of development funds by governments and international organizations. Those
decisions should be based on the most accurate poverty figures. However, often
reliable poverty figures are not available at fine geographical levels or for
particular risk population subgroups due to the sample size limitation of
current national surveys. These surveys cannot cover adequately all the desired
areas or population subgroups and, therefore, models relating the different
areas are needed to 'borrow strength"" from area to area. In particular, the
Spanish Survey on Income and Living Conditions (SILC) produces national poverty
estimates but cannot provide poverty estimates by Spanish provinces due to the
poor precision of direct estimates, which use only the province specific data.
It also raises the ethical question of whether poverty is more severe for women
than for men in a given province. We develop a hierarchical Bayes (HB) approach
for poverty mapping in Spanish provinces by gender that overcomes the small
province sample size problem of the SILC. The proposed approach has a wide
scope of application because it can be used to estimate general nonlinear
parameters. We use a Bayesian version of the nested error regression model in
which Markov chain Monte Carlo procedures and the convergence monitoring
therein are avoided. A simulation study reveals good frequentist properties of
the HB approach. The resulting poverty maps indicate that poverty, both in
frequency and intensity, is localized mostly in the southern and western
provinces and it is more acute for women than for men in most of the provinces.

adopt the generalized smoothing estimation of nonlinear dynamic systems of
Ramsay et al. [J. R. Stat. Soc. Ser. B Stat. Methodol. 69 (2007) 741-796]. In
this framework, the ODE solution is approximated with a penalized spline, where
the ODE model is incorporated in the penalty. We propose to optimize the
generalized smoothing by using penalty weights that minimize the covariance
penalties criterion (Efron [J. Amer. Statist. Assoc. 99 (2004) 619-642]). The
covariance penalties criterion provides an estimate of the prediction error for
nonlinear estimation rules resulting from nonlinear and/or nonhomogeneous ODE
models, such as our model of glucose-insulin dynamics. We also propose to
select the optimal number and location of knots for B-spline bases used to
represent the ODE solution. The results of the small simulation study
demonstrate advantages of optimized generalized smoothing in terms of smaller
estimation errors for ODE parameters and smaller prediction errors for
solutions of differential equations. Using the proposed approach to analyze the

consider the two player, perfect information game $\WC(n,q,\cA)$, which is
defined as follows. The game proceeds in rounds. In each round, the first
player, called Waiter, offers the second player, called Client, $q+1$ edges of
the complete graph $K_n$ which have not been offered previously. Client then
chooses one of these edges which he keeps and the remaining $q$ edges go back
to Waiter. If at the end of the game, the graph which consists of the edges
chosen by Client satisfies the property $\cA$, then Waiter is declared the
winner; otherwise Client wins the game. In this paper we study such games (also
known as Picker-Chooser games) for a variety of natural graph theoretic
parameters, such as the size of a largest component or the length of a longest
cycle. In particular, we describe a phase transition type phenomenon which
occurs when the parameter $q$ is close to $n$ and is reminiscent of phase
transition phenomena in random graphs. Namely, we prove that if $q \leq (1 -
\varepsilon) n$, then Client can avoid connected components of order $c
\varepsilon^{-2} \ln n$ for some absolute constant $c > 0$, whereas, for $q
\geq (1 + \varepsilon) n$, Waiter can force a giant, linearly sized, connected
component in Client's graph. We also prove that Waiter can force Client's graph
to be pancyclic for every $q \leq c n$, where $c > 0$ is an appropriate
constant.

the early phase of CME evolution. Observations now show the ejection of
magnetic flux ropes from the solar corona and how they evolve into CMEs. These
observations are difficult to interpret in terms of basic physical mechanisms
and quantities. To fully understand CMEs we need to compare equivalent
quantities derived from both observations and theoretical models. To this end
we aim to produce synthesised AIA observations from simluations of a flux rope
ejection. To carry this out we include the role of thermal conduction and
radiative losses, both of which are important for determining the temperature
distribution of the solar corona during a CME. We perform a simulation where a
flux rope is ejected from the solar corona. From the density and temperature of
the plasma in the simulation we synthesise AIA observations. The emission is
then integrated along the line of sight using the instrumental response
function of AIA. We sythesise observations of AIA in the channels at 304 A, 171
A, 335 A, and 94 A. The synthesised observations show a number of features
similar to actual observations and in particular reproduce the general
development of CMEs in the low corona as observed by AIA. In particular we
reproduce an erupting and expanding arcade in the 304 A and 171 A channels with
a high density core. The ejection of a flux rope reproduces many of the
features found in the AIA observations. This work is therefore a step forward
in bridging the gap between observations and models, and can lead to more
direct interpretations of EUV observations in terms of flux rope ejections. We

Gelfand-Pinsker coding method for 3-receiver cases. Using the method, we
establish a unified inner bound on the capacity region of 3-receiver Gaussian
broadcast channels under general message side information configuration. The
achievability proof of the inner bound uses an idea of joint interference
cancelation, where interference is canceled by using both dirty-paper coding at
the encoder and successive decoding at some of the decoders. We show that the
inner bound is larger than that achieved by state of the art coding schemes. An
outer bound is also established and shown to be tight in 46 out of all 64
possible cases.

the flow. Statistical hydrodynamics thus respect chirality, as symmetry
breaking and restoration are key to their fundamentals, such as the spectral
transfer direction and its mechanism. Homochiral sub-system of
three-dimensional (3D) Navier-Stokes isotropic turbulence has been numerically
realized with helical representation technique to present inverse energy
cascade [Biferale et al., Phys. Rev. Lett., {\bf 108}, 164501 (2012)]. The
situation is analogous to 2D turbulence where inverse energy cascade, or more
generally energy-enstrophy dual cascade scenario, was argued with the help of a
negative temperature state of the absolute equilibrium by Kraichnan. Indeed, if
the helicity in such a system is taken to be positive without loss of
generality, a corresponding negative temperature state can be identified [Zhu
et al., J. Fluid Mech., {\bf 739}, 479 (2014)]. Here, for some specific chiral
ensembles of turbulence, we show with the corresponding absolute equilibria
that even if the helicity distribution over wavenumbers is sign definite,
different \textit{ansatzes} of the shape function, defined by the ratio between
the specific helicity and energy spectra $s(k)=H(k)/E(k)$, imply distinct
transfer directions, and we could have inverse-helicity and forward-energy dual
transfers (with, say, $s(k)\propto k^{-2}$ resulting in absolute equilibrium
modal spectral density of energy $U(k)=\frac{1}{\alpha +\beta k^{-2}}$, exactly
the enstrophy one of two-dimensional Euler by Kraichan), simultaneous forward
transfers (with $s(k)=constant$), or even no simply-directed transfer (with,
say, non-monotonic $s(k) \propto \sin^2k$), besides the inverse-energy and
forward-helicity dual transfers (with, say, $s(k)=k$ as in the homochiral

estimated probabilities of a patient having a certain mutation status are
available. Also, ages of disease-onset are subject to right censoring. Existing

satisfies self-consistent estimating equations and has high power in detecting
differences between the cumulative risks of different populations. Application
of our estimator to a Parkinson's disease (PD) study provides the age-at-onset

cosmological constant can be linked to the time at which the cosmic neutrinos
become nonrelativistic. This naturally places the onset of the Universe's
accelerated expansion in recent cosmic history, addressing the why-now problem

spoiling the cosmological evolution. The attractive force between neutrinos
arising from their coupling to Dark Energy grows as large as $10^6$ times the

nonlinear stabilization phenomenon ensures only mildly nonlinear oscillating

scatter between values of \sim1000 and \sim3000 years. The shock velocities in

fundamental RR Lyrae variables in globular clusters. By adopting the chemical
composition determined from spectroscopic observations and a criterion to
account for the hysteresis mechanism, we tuned age and mass-loss to
simultaneously reproduce the morphology of both the turn-off and the Horizontal
Branch of a sample of 17 globular clusters of the Milky Way and of nearby dwarf
galaxies in the crucial metallicity range (-1.9<[Fe/H]<-1.4) where the
Oostheroff transition is apparent. We find that the Oosterhoff dichotomy among
Galactic globular clusters is naturally reproduced by models. The analysis of
the relative impact of the various involved parameters indicates that the main
responsibles of the dichotomy are the peculiar distribution of clusters in the
age-metallicity plane and the hysteresis. In particular, there is a clear
connection between the two main branches of the age-metallicity relation for
Galactic globular clusters and the Oosterhoff groups. The properties of
clusters' RR Lyrae belonging to other Oostheroff groups (OoInt and OoIII) are
instead not well reproduced. While for OoIII clusters a larger helium abundance
for a fraction of the cluster's stars can reconcile the model prediction with
observations, some other parameter affecting both the Horizontal Branch
morphology and the RR Lyrae periods is required to reproduce the behavior of
OoInt clusters.

challenges to the focusing optics. In particular, a long propagation distance
of about 900 m between x-ray source and sample leads to a large lateral photon
beam size at the optics. The beam divergence is the most important parameter
for the optical system, and is largest for the lowest photon energies and for
the shortest pulse duration (corresponding to the lowest charge). Due to the
large divergence of nominal X-ray pulses with duration shorter than 10 fs, one
suffers diffraction from mirror aperture, leading to a 100-fold decrease in
fluence at photon energies around 4 keV, which are ideal for imaging of single
biomolecules. The nominal SASE1 output power is about 50 GW. This is very far
from the level required for single biomolecule imaging, even assuming perfect

gives rise to a frequency band of dark soliton solutions, which are found
analytically for the lossless zero-velocity case. The soliton's far-field value
varies from zero to infinity as the operating frequency varies across the band.
For positive detuning (photon frequency higher than exciton frequency), the
exciton wavefunction becomes discontinuous when the operating frequency exceeds
the exciton frequency. This phenomenon lies outside the parameter regime of
validity of the Gross-Pitaevskii (GP) model. Within its regime of validity, we
give a derivation of a single-mode GP model from the initial Schr\""odinger

platform achieves a maximum cruising speed (Vh) of 407 kmh-1 and demonstrates
responsive flight controls throughout its flight envelope even in sustained
wind speed of 225 kmh-1. Being a small and agile UAV, it can be flown below the
storm to measure surface wind directly and avoid possible uncertainty
associated with the vertical wind profile adjustment. Chute-free vertical

develop cost effective UAVs that can be employed in a multi-agent setting to
acquire high resolution data to enhance understanding of cyclogenesis and to

the field of radar signal processing. Many novel MIMO radar waveforms have been
developed by considering various performance metrics and constraints. In this
paper, we show that finite alphabet constant-envelope (FACE) quadrature-pulse
shift keying (QPSK) waveforms can be designed to realize a given covariance
matrix by transforming a constrained nonlinear optimization problem into an
unconstrained nonlinear optimization problem. In addition, we design QPSK
waveforms in a way that they don't cause interference to a cellular system, by
steering nulls towards a selected base station (BS). The BS is selected
according to our algorithm which guarantees minimum degradation in radar
performance due to null space projection (NSP) of radar waveforms. We design
QPSK waveforms with spectrum sharing constraints for a stationary and moving
radar platform. We show that the waveform designed for stationary MIMO radar
matches the desired beampattern closely, when the number of BS antennas
$N^{\text{BS}}$ is considerably less than the number of radar antennas $M$, due
to quasi-static interference channel. However, for moving radar the difference
between designed and desired waveforms is larger than stationary radar, due to
rapidly changing channel.

bone-like feature within the prominent Scutum-Centaurus spiral arm. Re-analysis
of mid-infrared imagery from the Spitzer Space Telescope shows that this IRDC

claimed by Nessie's discoverers (Jackson et al. 2010); its aspect ratio is
therefore at least 300:1, and possibly as large as 800:1. A careful accounting
for both the Sun's offset from the Galactic plane ($\sim 25$ pc) and the
Galactic center's offset from the $(l^{II},b^{II})=(0,0)$ position shows that
the latitude of the true Galactic mid-plane at the 3.1 kpc distance to the
Scutum-Centaurus Arm is not $b=0$, but instead closer to $b=-0.4$, which is the
latitude of Nessie to within a few pc. An analysis of the radial velocities of
low-density (CO) and high-density (${\rm NH}_3$) gas associated with the Nessie
dust feature suggests that Nessie runs along the Scutum-Centaurus Arm in
position-position-velocity space, which means it likely forms a dense `spine'
of the arm in real space as well. The Scutum-Centaurus arm is the closest major
spiral arm to the Sun toward the inner Galaxy, and, at the longitude of Nessie,
it is almost perpendicular to our line of sight, making Nessie the easiest
feature to see as a shadow elongated along the Galactic Plane from our
