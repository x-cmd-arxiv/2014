of geometric quantum phases in the relativistic and nonrelativistic quantum
dynamics of a Dirac neutral particle from the effects of the violation of the
Lorentz symmetry in the cosmic string spacetime is investigated. It is shown
that the Dirac equation can be written in terms of an effective metric and a
relativistic geometric phase stems from the topology of the cosmic string
spacetime and the Lorentz symmetry breaking effects. Further, the
nonrelativistic limit of the Dirac equation is discussed and it is shown that
both Lorentz symmetry breaking effects and the topology of the defect yields a
phase shift in the wave function of the nonrelativistic spin-1/2 particle.

of the defects are single vacancies. The vacancies are characterized by
scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS) on graphene and HOPG exhibiting a peak
close to the Fermi level. The peak persists after air exposure up to 180 min,
albeit getting broader. After air exposure for less than 60 min, electron spin
resonance (ESR) at 9.6 GHz is performed. For an ion flux of 10/nm^2, we find a
signal corresponding to a g-factor of 2.001-2.003 and a spin density of 1-2
spins/nm^2. The ESR signal consists of a mixture of a Gaussian and a Lorentzian
of equal weight exhibiting a width down to 0.17 mT, which, however, depends on
details of the sample preparation. The g-factor anisotropy is about 0.02%.
Temperature dependent measurements reveal antiferromagnetic correlations with a
Curie-Weiss temperature of -10 K. Albeit the electrical conductivity of
graphene is significantly reduced by ion bombardment, the spin resonance

the simplest yolk-shell model system involving purely repulsive hard-body

determine the mean squared displacement of both types of particles, as well as
the intermediate scattering function of the yolk-shell complex. We compare the

increasingly attractive research topic due to its applications in wireless

and storage complexity, this paper proposes a simple sensing and estimation
framework to faithfully recover the principal subspace of high-dimensional data
streams using a collection of binary measurements from distributed sensors,
without transmitting the whole data. The binary measurements are designed to
indicate comparison outcomes of aggregated energy projections of the data
samples over pairs of randomly selected directions. When the covariance matrix
is a low-rank matrix, we propose a spectral estimator that recovers the
principal subspace of the covariance matrix as the subspace spanned by the top
eigenvectors of a properly designed surrogate matrix, which is provably
accurate as soon as the number of binary measurements is sufficiently large. An
adaptive rank selection strategy based on soft thresholding is also presented.
Furthermore, we propose a tailored spectral estimator when the covariance
matrix is additionally Toeplitz, and show reliable estimation can be obtained
from a substantially smaller number of binary measurements. Our results hold
even when a constant fraction of the binary measurements is randomly flipped.
Finally, we develop a low-complexity online algorithm to track the principal
subspace when new measurements arrive sequentially. Numerical examples are
provided to validate the proposed approach.

extinction run with distance and to estimate the distance of the Great Cygnus
Rift, 800 pc. The interstellar reddening law in the optical and near-infrared
regions is found to be close to normal, with the ratio of extinction to color
excess R(BV) = 2.87. The extinction A(V) of cluster members is between 2.5 to
3.8 mag, with a mean value of 2.97 mag or E(B-V) = 1.03. The average distance
of eight stars of spectral types O9-B2 is 1.54 +- 0.15 kpc. Two stars from the

It is shown that the LT precession does not obey the general inverse cube law

becomes maximum just near the horizon, falls sharply and becomes zero near the
horizon. The precession rate increases again and after that it falls obeying
the general inverse cube law of distance. This anomaly is maximum at the polar
region of this spacetime and it vanishes after crossing a certain `critical'

define strategies for this extended game. We assume the existence of a trusted

  Networks",,,,,"physics.soc-ph cs.SI nlin.AO physics.bio-ph q-bio.PE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In the study of networks, it is often insightful to use algorithms to
determine mesoscale features such as ""community structure"", in which densely
connected sets of nodes constitute ""communities"" that have sparse connections
to other communities. The most popular way of detecting communities
algorithmically is to optimize the quality function known as modularity. When
optimizing modularity, one compares the actual connections in a (static or
time-dependent) network to the connections obtained from a random-graph
ensemble that acts as a null model. The communities are then the sets of nodes
that are connected to each other densely relative to what is expected from the
null model. Clearly, the process of community detection depends fundamentally
on the choice of null model, so it is important to develop and analyze novel
null models that take into account appropriate features of the system under
study. In this paper, we investigate the effects of using null models that take
incorporate spatial information, and we propose a novel null model based on the
radiation model of population spread. We also develop novel synthetic spatial
benchmark networks in which the connections between entities are based on
distance or flux between nodes, and we compare the performance of both static
and time-dependent radiation null models to the standard (""Newman-Girvan"") null
model for modularity optimization and a recently-proposed gravity null model.
In our comparisons, we use both the above synthetic benchmarks and
time-dependent correlation networks that we construct using countrywide dengue
fever incidence data for Peru. We also evaluate a recently-proposed correlation
null model, which was developed specifically for correlation networks that are
constructed from time series, on the epidemic-correlation data.

Einstein-scalar field and Einstein-stiff fluid systems. Our results apply to
small perturbations of the spatially flat FLRW solution with topology
$(0,\infty) \times \mathbb{T}^3.$ The FLRW solution models a spatially uniform
scalar-field/stiff fluid evolving in a spacetime that expands towards the
future and that has a ""Big Bang"" singularity at $\lbrace 0 \rbrace \times
\mathbb{T}^3,$ where its curvature blows up. We place data on a Cauchy
hypersurface $\Sigma_1'$ that are close to the FLRW data induced on $\lbrace 1
\rbrace \times \mathbb{T}^3.$ We study the perturbed solution in the collapsing
direction and prove that its basic features closely resemble those of the FLRW
solution. In particular, we construct constant mean curvature-transported
spatial coordinates for the perturbed solution covering $(t,x) \in (0,1] \times
\mathbb{T}^3$ and show that it also has a Big Bang at $\lbrace 0 \rbrace \times
\mathbb{T}^3,$ where its curvature blows up. The blow-up confirms Penrose's
Strong Cosmic Censorship hypothesis for the ""past-half"" of near-FLRW solutions.
  The most difficult aspect of the proof is showing that the solution exists
for $(t,x) \in (0,1] \times \mathbb{T}^3,$ and to this end, we derive energy
estimates that are allowed to mildly blow-up as $t \downarrow 0.$ To close
these estimates, we use the most important ingredient in our analysis: an
$L^2-$type energy approximate monotonicity inequality that holds for near-FLRW
solutions. In the companion article ""A regime of linear stability for the
Einstein-scalar field system with applications to nonlinear Big Bang
formation,"" we used the approximate monotonicity to prove a stability result
for solutions to linearized versions of the equations. The present article
shows that the linear stability result can be upgraded to control the nonlinear
terms.

mimics the stationary aspects of a firewall that Almheiri et al have argued to
ensue in an evaporating black hole spacetime. Within first-order perturbation
theory, we show that the detector's response on falling through the horizon is
sudden but finite. The difference from the Minkowski vacuum response is
proportional to $\omega^{-2}\ln(|\omega|)$ for the non-derivative detector and
to $\ln(|\omega|)$ for the derivative-coupling detector, both in the limit of a
large energy gap $\omega$ and in the limit of adiabatic switching. Adding to
the quantum state high Rindler temperature excitations behind the horizon
increases the detector's response proportionally to the temperature; this

Braunstein et al. We speculate that the $(1+1)$-dimensional derivative-coupling

show that the morphologies of the extended continuum and the ionised gas

other. In particular, we detect for the first time a spectacular structure of
ionised gas in the form of filaments extending ~23 kpc to the east of the
nuclear region. The quiescent ionised gas kinematics at these locations
suggests that these filaments are tidal debris left over from a secondary
merger event that are illuminated by an AGN in the nuclear regions. The images
also reveal a complex morphology in the nuclear region of the galaxy for both
the continuum and the [OIII] emission. Kinematic disturbance, in the form of
broad (FWHM > 500 km s-1) and/or strongly shifted (abs(\DeltaV) >150 km s-1)
emission line components, is found at almost all locations within a radius of
~4 kpc to the east and west of the northern nucleus. We fit the profiles of all
the emission lines of different ionisation with a kinematic model using up to 3
Gaussian components. From these fits we derive diagnostic line ratios that are
used to investigate the ionisation mechanisms at the different locations in the
galaxy. We show that, in general, the line ratios are consistent with
photoionization by an AGN as the main ionisation mechanism. Finally, the
highest surface brightness [OIII] emission is found in a compact region that is
coincident with the so-called SE nuclear component. The compactness, kinematics
and emission line ratios of this component suggest that it is a separate
nucleus with its own AGN.

make progress on the 2D problem (which can be realised in 3D by considering a
long cuboid, or alternatively a rectangular cross-sectioned dreidel).

particularly bouncy or grippy surfaces where the die rolls through many

every kind of skin. In this paper, an approach is proposed to solve this

including two stages. In the first one, the skin intensity distribution is
estimated using some train photos of pure skin, and at the second stage, the
skin pixels are detected using Gaussian model and optimal threshold tuning.
Then from the skin region facial features have been extracted to get the face
from the skin region. In the results section, the proposed approach is applied
on FEI database and the accuracy rate reached 99.25%. The proposed approach can
be used for all kinds of skin using train stage which is the main advantage

  Equations",,,,,"math.AP math-ph math.MP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In his 2007 monograph, D. Christodoulou proved a breakthrough result giving a
detailed description of the formation of shocks in solutions to the
relativistic Euler equations in three spatial dimensions. He assumed that the
data have small $H^N$ norm, where $N$ is a sufficiently large integer. To
deduce the shock formation, he also assumed that the data verify a signed
integral inequality. In the present monograph, we extend Christodoulou's
framework and use it to prove that shock singularities often develop in
initially small, regular solutions to two important classes of quasilinear wave
equations in three spatial dimensions. Our work also generalizes and unifies
earlier work on singularity formation initiated by F. John in the 1970's and
continued by L. H\""ormander, S. Alinhac, and many others. Specifically, we
study $\mbox{i)}$ covariant scalar wave equations of the form
$\square_{g(\Psi)} \Psi = 0$ and $\mbox{ii)}$ non-covariant scalar wave
equations of the form $(h^{-1})^{\alpha \beta}(\partial \Phi) \partial_{\alpha}
\partial_{\beta} \Phi = 0.$ Our main result shows that whenever the nonlinear
terms fail Klainerman's classic null condition, shocks develop in solutions
arising from an open set of small data. Hence, within the classes $\mbox{i)}$
and $\mbox{ii)}$, our work can be viewed as a sharp converse to the well-known
result of Christodoulou and Klainerman, which showed that when the classic null
condition is verified, small-data global existence holds.

The system detects the vehicle first and then captures the image of the front

segmented. For finding the place of plate, a novel and real time method is
expressed. A new and robust technique based on directional chain code is used
for character recognition. The resulting vehicle number is then compared with
the available database of all the vehicles so as to come up with information
about the vehicle type and to charge entrance cost accordingly. The system is
then allowed to open parking barrier for the vehicle and generate entrance cost
receipt. The vehicle information (such as entrance time, date, and cost amount)
is also stored in the database to maintain the record. The hardware and
software integrated system is implemented and a working prototype model is
developed. Under the available database, the average accuracy of locating
vehicle license plate obtained 100%. Using 70% samples of character for
training, we tested our scheme on whole samples and obtained 100% correct

directions of translation and rotation. To meet the very stringent requirements
of Advanced LIGO, the system must provide more than three orders of magnitude
of isolation over a very large bandwidth. It must bring the motion below
10^(-11) m/(Hz)^0.5 at 1 Hz and 10^(-12) m/(Hz)^0.5 at 10 Hz. A prototype of
this system has been built in 2006. It has been extensively tested and analyzed
during the following two years. This paper shows how the experimental results
obtained with the prototype were used to engineer the final design. It
highlights how the engineering solutions implemented not only improved the
isolation performance but also greatly simplified the assembly, testing, and
commissioning process. During the past two years, five units have been
constructed, tested, installed and commissioned at each of the two LIGO

requirements, and reach the sensor noise in the control bandwidth.

of tractable size, and the three conditions have been observed to occur in the

to prove the log-concavity of the genus distributions of graphs constructed by
iterative amalgamation of double-rooted graph fragments whose genus

practical applications and generalizes many combinatorial problems.
Unfortunately, it is generally not possible to maximize a monotone set function
up to an acceptable approximation ratio, even subject to simple constraints.
One highly studied approach to cope with this hardness is to restrict the set
function. An outstanding disadvantage of imposing such a restriction on the set
function is that no result is implied for set functions deviating from the
restriction, even slightly. A more flexible approach, studied by Feige and
Izsak, is to design an approximation algorithm whose approximation ratio
depends on the complexity of the instance, as measured by some complexity
measure. Specifically, they introduced a complexity measure called supermodular
degree, measuring deviation from submodularity, and designed an algorithm for
the welfare maximization problem with an approximation ratio that depends on
this measure.
  In this work, we give the first (to the best of our knowledge) algorithm for
maximizing an arbitrary monotone set function, subject to a k-extendible
system. This class of constraints captures, for example, the intersection of
k-matroids (note that a single matroid constraint is sufficient to capture the
welfare maximization problem). Our approximation ratio deteriorates gracefully
with the complexity of the set function and k. Our work can be seen as
generalizing both the classic result of Fisher, Nemhauser and Wolsey, for
maximizing a submodular set function subject to a k-extendible system, and the
result of Feige and Izsak for the welfare maximization problem. Moreover, when
our algorithm is applied to each one of these simpler cases, it obtains the
same approximation ratio as of the respective original work.

meteor generated infrasound signal classification has been developed using the
time-pressure signal of the infrasound arrivals. Based on the location along
the meteor trail where the infrasound signal originates, we find most signals
are associated with cylindrical shocks, with about a quarter of events
evidencing spherical shocks associated with fragmentation events and optical
flares. The video data indicate that all events with ray launch angles >117 deg
from the trajectory heading are most likely generated by a spherical shock,
while infrasound produced by the meteors with ray launch angles <117 deg can be
attributed to both a cylindrical line source and a spherical shock. We find
that meteors preferentially produce infrasound toward the end of their trails
with a smaller number showing a preference for mid-trail production. Meteors
producing multiple infrasound arrivals show a strong infrasound source height
skewness to the end of trails and are much more likely to be associated with
optical flares. While a significant fraction of our meteors producing
infrasound (~1/4 of single arrivals) are produced by fragmentation events, we
find no instances where acoustic radiation is detectable more than about 60 deg
beyond the ballistic regime at our meteoroid sizes (grams to tens of kg)

The geometries of both Janus and sphere-dimer motors with asymmetric catalytic
activity support the formation of concentration gradients around the motors.
Because directed motion can occur only when the system is not in equilibrium,
the nature of the environment and the role it plays in motor dynamics are

elements for 2-parton non-local operators, as well as matrix elements for
3-parton non-local correlators. Their detailed parametrization is fixed based
on parity, charge conjugation and time reversal invariance. This leads to the
introduction of 28 real GPDs, which are subject to constraints coming from the

  Model: A Convex Optimization Approach",,,,,"q-bio.GN","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Translation is an important stage in gene expression. During this stage,
macro-molecules called ribosomes travel along the mRNA strand linking
amino-acids together in a specific order to create a functioning protein. An
important question is how to maximize protein production. Indeed, translation
is known to consume most of the cell's energy and it is natural to assume that
evolution shaped this process so that it maximizes the protein production rate.
If this is indeed so then one can estimate various parameters of the
translation machinery by solving an appropriate mathematical optimization
problem. The same problem also arises in the context of synthetic biology,
namely, re-engineer heterologous genes in order to maximize their translation
rate in a host organism. We consider the problem of maximizing the protein
production rate using a computational model for translation-elongation called
the ribosome flow model (RFM). This model describes the flow of the ribosomes
along an mRNA chain of length n using a set of n first-order nonlinear ODEs. It
also includes n+1 positive parameters: the ribosomal initiation rate into the
mRNA chain, and n elongation rates along the chain sites. We show that the
steady-state translation rate in the RFM is a strictly concave function of its
parameters. This means that the problem of maximizing the translation rate
under a suitable constraint always admits a unique solution, and that this
solution can be determined using highly-efficient algorithms for solving convex
optimization problems even for large values of n. Furthermore, our analysis
shows that the optimal translation rate can be computed based only on the
optimal initiation rate and the elongation rate of the codons near the
beginning of the ORF. We discuss some applications of the theoretical results
to synthetic biology, molecular evolution, and functional genomics.

cloud-based data processing systems. We consider a heterogeneous service
system, consisting of multiple large server pools. The pools are different in
that their servers may have different processing speed and/or different buffer
sizes (which may be finite or infinite). We study an asymptotic regime in which
the customer arrival rate and pool sizes scale to infinity simultaneously, in
proportion to some scaling parameter $n$.
  Arriving customers are assigned to the servers by a ""router"", according to a
{\em pull-based} algorithm, called PULL. Under the algorithm, each server sends
a ""pull-message"" to the router, when it becomes idle; the router assigns an
arriving customer to a server according to a randomly chosen available
pull-message, if there are any, or to a random server, otherwise.
  Assuming sub-critical system load, we prove asymptotic optimality of PULL.
Namely, as system scale $n\to\infty$, the steady-state probability of an
arriving customer experiencing blocking or waiting, vanishes. We also describe
some generalizations of the model and PULL algorithm, for which the asymptotic
optimality still holds.

Faraday effect should be able to distinguish the ground state of the spin
liquid, as we predict no rotation for massless Dirac spinons. We give a
semiquantitative estimate for the magnitude of the effect and find that it

over a broad range of orbital and physical parameters suggest that these
planets will span a wide range of climatic regimes. Characterization of the
atmospheres of warm super-Earths has already begun and will be extended to
smaller and more distant planets over the coming decade. The habitability of
these worlds may be strongly affected by their three-dimensional atmospheric
circulation regimes, since the global climate feedbacks that control the inner
and outer edges of the habitable zone including transitions to Snowball-like
states and runaway-greenhouse feedbacks depend on the equator-to-pole
temperature differences, patterns of relative humidity, and other aspects of
the dynamics. Here, using an idealized moist atmospheric general circulation
model including a hydrological cycle, we study the dynamical principles
governing the atmospheric dynamics on such planets. We show how the planetary
rotation rate, stellar flux, atmospheric mass, surface gravity, optical
thickness, and planetary radius affect the atmospheric circulation and
temperature distribution on such planets. Our simulations demonstrate that
equator-to-pole temperature differences, meridional heat transport rates,
structure and strength of the winds, and the hydrological cycle vary strongly
with these parameters, implying that the sensitivity of the planet to global
climate feedbacks will depend significantly on the atmospheric circulation. We
elucidate the possible climatic regimes and diagnose the mechanisms controlling
the formation of atmospheric jet streams, Hadley and Ferrel cells, and
latitudinal temperature differences. Finally, we discuss the implications for
understanding how the atmospheric circulation influences the global climate.

a multitude of stars have been observed with space telescopes, only a handful
of red-giant stars were targets of spectroscopic asteroseismic observing
projects. We search for solar-like oscillations in the two bright red-giant
stars $\gamma$ Psc and $\theta^1$ Tau from time series of ground-based
spectroscopy and determine the frequency of the excess of oscillation power
$\nu_{max}$ and the mean large frequency separation $\Delta\nu$ for both stars.
The radial velocities of $\gamma$ Psc and $\theta^1$ Tau were monitored for 120
and 190 days, respectively. Nearly 9000 spectra were obtained. To reach the
accurate radial velocities, we used simultaneous thorium-argon and iodine-cell
calibration of our optical spectra. In addition to the spectroscopy, we
acquired VLTI observations of $\gamma$ Psc for an independent estimate of the
radius. Also 22 days of observations of $\theta^1$ Tau with the MOST-satellite
were analysed. The frequency analysis of the radial velocity data of $\gamma$
Psc revealed an excess of oscillation power around 32 $\mu$Hz and a large
frequency separation of 4.1$\pm$0.1$\mu$Hz. $\theta^1$ Tau exhibits oscillation
power around 90 $\mu$Hz, with a large frequency separation of
6.9$\pm$0.2$\mu$Hz. Scaling relations indicate that $\gamma$ Psc is a star of
about $\sim$1 M$_\odot$ and $\sim$10 R$_\odot$. $\theta^1$ Tau appears to be a
massive star of about $\sim$2.7 M$_\odot$ and $\sim$11 R$_\odot$. The radial
velocities of both stars were found to be modulated on time scales much longer
than the oscillation periods. While the mass of $\theta^1$ Tau is in agreement
with results from dynamical parallaxes, we find a lower mass for $\gamma$ Psc
than what is given in the literature. The long periodic variability agrees with
the expected time scales of rotational modulation.

collinear and planar noncollinear Heisenberg antiferromagnets (AFs) on the same
footing. The spins in the system are assumed to be identical and
crystallographically equivalent. This formulation allows calculations of the
anisotropic magnetic susceptibility chi versus temperature T below the AF
ordering temperature TN to be carried out for arbitrary Heisenberg exchange
interactions J{ij} between arbitrary neighbors j of a given spin i without
recourse to magnetic sublattices. The Weiss temperature theta_p in the
Curie-Weiss law is written in terms of the J{ij} values and TN in terms of the
J{ij} values and an assumed AF structure. Other magnetic and thermal properties
are then expressed in terms of quantities easily accessible from experiment as
laws of corresponding states for a given spin S. For collinear ordering these
properties are the reduced temperature t = T/TN, the ratio f = theta_p/TN and
S. For planar noncollinear helical or cycloidal ordering, an additional
parameter is the wavevector of the helix or cycloid. The MFT is also applicable
to AFs with other AF structures. The MFT predicts that chi(T <= TN) of
noncollinear 120 degree spin structures on triangular lattices is isotropic and
independent of S and T and thus clarifies the origin of this universally
observed behavior. The high-field magnetization and heat capacity for fields
applied perpendicular to the ordering axis (collinear AFs) and ordering plane
(planar noncollinear AFs) are also calculated and expressed for both types of
AF structures as laws of corresponding states for a given S, and the reduced
perpendicular field versus reduced temperature phase diagram is constructed.

interactions to be zero when all particles are mass on-shell, but not if one or
more are mass off-shell. For three particle interactions, we have found three
interesting cases: one massive gauge boson with two identical scalars; one
massless gauge boson with two different scalars; one massive gauge boson with
two identical massless gauge bosons. For each case, we identify the relevant
effective operators to explore its dip signature at the LHC. Unfortunately, the
unstable particle with a vanishing mass-on-shell interaction has a complex mass
which is coincident with the complex pole in its propagator. As a result, a
contact-like amplitude without a dip is produced. We then point out two other
interesting ways that generate a dip in the cross section. The first way has a
dip signature due to a zero in the vertex form factor of the time-like momentum
in the s-channel. In the second way, the dip plus bump signature appears
because there is destructive interference among processes of exchanging
different s-channel particles.

highly conducting fluids. Traditionally, magnetic reconnection was associated
mostly with solar flares. In reality, the process must be ubiquitous as
astrophysical fluids are magnetized and motions of fluid elements necessarily
entail crossing of magnetic frozen in field lines and magnetic reconnection. We
consider magnetic reconnection in realistic 3D geometry in the presence of
turbulence. This turbulence in most astrophysical settings is of pre-existing
nature, but it also can be induced by magnetic reconnection itself. In this
situation turbulent magnetic field wandering opens up reconnection outflow
regions, making reconnection fast. We discuss Lazarian \& Vishniac (1999) model
of turbulent reconnection, its numerical and observational testings, as well as
its connection to the modern understanding of the Lagrangian properties of
turbulent fluids. We show that the predicted dependences of the reconnection
rates on the level of MHD turbulence make the generally accepted Goldreich \&
Sridhar (1995) model of turbulence self-consistent. Similarly, we argue that
the well-known Alfv\'en theorem on flux freezing is not valid for the turbulent
fluids and therefore magnetic fields diffuse within turbulent volumes.
  This is an element of magnetic field dynamics that was not accounted by
earlier theories. For instance, the theory of star formation that was
developing assuming that it is only the drift of neutrals that can violate the
otherwise perfect flux freezing, is affected and we discuss the consequences of
the turbulent diffusion of magnetic fields mediated by reconnection.

For the A_N series, this leads to the usual notion of bifundamental matter. For
the other cases it corresponds to a strongly interacting (1,0) superconformal
system in six dimensions. Similarly, an ADE singularity intersecting the
Horava-Witten wall leads to a superconformal matter system with E_8 x G global
symmetry. Using the F-theory realization of these theories, we elucidate the
Coulomb/tensor branch of (G,G') conformal matter. This leads to the notion of
fractionalization of an M5-brane on an ADE singularity as well as
fractionalization of the intersection point of the ADE singularity with the
Horava-Witten wall. Partial Higgsing of these theories leads to new 6d SCFTs in
the infrared, which we also characterize. This generalizes the class of (1,0)
theories which can be perturbatively realized by suspended branes in IIA string
theory. By reducing on a circle, we arrive at novel duals for 5d affine quiver
theories. Introducing many M5-branes leads to large N gravity duals.

discovery of the more energetic type II, spicules have become a heated topic
but their contribution to the energy balance of the low solar atmosphere
remains unknown. Here we give a first glimpse of what quiet Sun spicules look
like when observed with NASA's recently launched Interface Region Imaging
Spectrograph (IRIS). Using IRIS spectra and filtergrams that sample the
chromosphere and transition region we compare the properties and evolution of
spicules as observed in a coordinated campaign with Hinode and the Atmospheric
Imaging Assembly. Our IRIS observations allow us to follow the thermal
evolution of type II spicules and finally confirm that the fading of Ca II H
spicules appears to be caused by rapid heating to higher temperatures. The IRIS
spicules do not fade but continue evolving, reaching higher and falling back
down after 500-800 s. Ca II H type II spicules are thus the initial stages of
violent and hotter events that mostly remain invisible in Ca II H filtergrams.
These events have very different properties from type I spicules, which show
lower velocities and no fading from chromospheric passbands. The IRIS spectra
of spicules show the same signature as their proposed disk counterparts,
reinforcing earlier work. Spectroheliograms from spectral rasters also confirm
that quiet Sun spicules originate in bushes from the magnetic network. Our
results suggest that type II spicules are indeed the site of vigorous heating
(to at least transition region temperatures) along extensive parts of the
upward moving spicular plasma.

proportional to wavelength to the power 1.23+/-0.31. This power is very close
to the power (4/3) expected if short timescale UV/optical variability is driven
by reprocessing of X-rays by a surrounding accretion disc.
  The observed lags, however, are longer than expected from a standard
Shakura-Sunyaev accretion disc with X-ray heating, given the currently accepted
black hole mass and accretion rate values, but can be explained with a slightly
larger mass and accretion rate, and a generally hotter disc.
  Some long term UV/optical variations are not paralleled exactly in the

arising perhaps from accretion rate perturbations propagating inwards through
the disc.

way to investigate the emission morphologies in the two conal regions, and more

with its special viewing geometry where the sightline traverses almost through

correlation between 10-500 GeV flux and underdense fraction along the line of

respectively. The preference for underdense sight lines is not displayed by
gamma-ray emitting galaxies within the second Fermi catalog, containing sources

this marginal correlation might be a result of lower extragalactic background
light (EBL) photon density within the underdense regions and find that, even in
the most extreme case of a entirely underdense sight line, the EBL photon
density is only 2% less than the nominal EBL density. Translating this into
gamma-ray attenuation along the line of sight for a highly attenuated source
with opacity tau(E,z) ~5, we estimate that the attentuation of gamma-rays
decreases no more than 10%. This decrease, although non-neglible, is unable to
account for the apparent hard source correlation with underdense lines of

character, which strongly influences the dynamical network and may hinder
isotropic interactions among low-energy defects, rather than to the
thermodynamic stabilization itself. This explanation may lend support to the
criticisms by Leggett and others to the standard Tunneling Model, although more
experiments in different kinds of ultrastable glasses are needed to ascertain

density, infall velocity, and turbulent velocity, and the rate of star
formation in compact massive gas clouds. The turbulent pressure is dynamically
important at all radii, a result of the adiabatic heating. The system evolves
toward a coherent spatial structure with a fixed run of density,
$\rho(r,t)\to\rho(r)$; mass flows through this structure onto the central star
or star cluster. We define the sphere of influence of the accreted matter by
$m_*=M_g(r_*)$, where $m_*$ is the stellar plus disk mass in the nascent star
cluster and $M_g(r)$ is the gas mass inside radius $r$. The density is given by
a broken power law with a slope $-1.5$ inside $r_*$ and $\sim -1.6$ to $-1.8$
outside $r_*$. Both $v_T$ and the infall velocity $|u_r|$ decrease with
decreasing $r$ for $r>r_*$; $v_T(r)\sim r^p$, the size-linewidth relation, with
$p\approx0.2-0.3$, explaining the observation that Larson's Law is altered in
massive star forming regions. The infall velocity is generally smaller than the
turbulent velocity at $r>r_*$. For $r<r_*$, the infall and turbulent velocities
are again similar, and both increase with decreasing $r$ as $r^{-1/2}$, with a
magnitude about half of the free-fall velocity. The accreted (stellar) mass
grows super-linearly with time, $\dot M_*=\phi M_{\rm cl}(t/\tau_{ff})^2$, with
$\phi$ a dimensionless number somewhat less than unity, $M_{\rm cl}$ the clump
mass and $\tau_{ff}$ the free-fall time of the clump. We suggest that small

fermion chains support a classic example of such a phase, having zero modes
that guarantee two-fold degeneracy in all eigenstates up to exponentially small
finite-size corrections. Chains of `parafermions'---generalized Majorana
fermions---also support localized zero modes, but, curiously, only under much

topological phase with an exponentially accurate ground-state degeneracy,
higher-energy states can exhibit a splitting that scales as a power law with
system size---categorically ruling out exact localized zero modes. The
transition to power-law behavior is described by critical behavior appearing

operates in ultra-high vacuum. It features two stages of isolation mounted in

provides isolation in all directions of translation and rotation. The system is
instrumented with a unique combination of low noise relative and inertial
sensors. The active control provides isolation from 0.1 Hz to 30 Hz. It brings
the platform motion down to 10^(-11) m/Hz^(0.5) at 1 Hz. Active and passive

the isolation requirements, but also to permit the construction, testing, and

the tensor product of the quaternions with themselves, the matrix form of

interacting gas of tilted dipoles in a single homogeneous quantum layer. Being
typical for strongly correlated systems, the roton phenomena appear to occur in
a weakly interacting gas. It is important that in contrast to a system of
normal to wide layer dipoles, breaking of the rotational symmetry for a system
of tilted dipoles leads to the convergence of the condensate depletion even up
to the threshold of the roton instability, with mean-field approach being
valid. Predicted effects can be observed in a wide class of dipolar systems. We
suggest observing predicted phenomena for systems of ultracold atoms and polar
molecules in optical lattices, and estimate optimal experimental parameters.

profile of the SiO emission within several massive dense clumps (MDCs) in
Cygnus-X. We find that most molecular outflows are detected in both SiO and CO,
although there are some cases of CO outflows with no SiO counterpart. We find a
significant amount of narrow line SiO emission that appears to be unrelated to
outflows. The fraction of the total SiO luminosity that is not associated with
outflows is highly variable in the different MDCs (from 10% to 90%); this might
be a problem when extrapolating outflow properties from SiO luminosities
without resolving individual outflows. The extent of the narrow SiO emission
varies from rather compact (~ 0.03 pc) to widespread (~0.2 pc), and its
kinematics often differs from those found by other high-density tracers such as
H13CO+. We find that the least centrally concentrated clumps with the least
massive protostellar cores have the most widespread narrow SiO emission. In
line with previous evidence of SiO emission associated with low-velocity
shocks, we propose an evolutionary picture to explain the existence and
distribution of narrow SiO line profiles. In this scenario, the least centrally
condensed MDCs are at an early stage where the SiO emission traces shocks from
the large-scale collapse of material onto the MDC (e.g. CygX-N40). As the MDC
collapses, the SiO emission becomes more confined to the close surroundings of
cores, tracing the post-shock material from the infalling MDC against the dense
cores (e.g. CygX-N3, N12, and N48). At later stages, when single massive
protostars are formed, the SiO luminosity is largely dominated by powerful
outflows, and the weaker narrow component shows perhaps the last remnants of
the initial collapse (e.g. CygX-N53 and N63).

DAC behaviour.

of the Magnetism in Massive Stars (MiMeS) project, we find no evidence for
surface dipolar magnetic fields in any of these stars. Using Bayesian
inference, we compute upper limits on the strengths of the fields and use these
limits to assess two potential mechanisms by which the field may influence wind
outflow: magnetic wind confinement and local photospheric brightness
enhancements. Within the limits we derive, both mechanisms fail to provide a
systematic process capable of producing DACs in all of the stars of our sample.
Therefore, this implies that dipolar fields are highly unlikely to be
responsible for these structures in all massive stars, meaning that some other
mechanism must come into play.

the magnetic structure evolves from a cycloid to a G-type antiferromagnet at
the morphotropic phase boundary, where there is a large piezoelectric response
due to an electric-field induced structural transition. The occurrence of the
magnetic structural transition at the morphotropic phase boundary offers
another route towards room temperature multiferroic devices.

from solid fracture to cell adhesion. Here, we show experimentally and
theoretically that Eshelby's theory breaks down for small liquid inclusions in

size-dependent with the smallest droplets mimicking the behaviour of solid

enhance the stiffness of soft solids. A straight-forward extension of Eshelby's

flares (TDFs) in inactive galaxies, based on a successful search for these
events among transients in galaxies using archival SDSS multi-epoch imaging
data (Stripe 82). This search yielded 186 nuclear flares in galaxies, of which
two are excellent TDF candidates. Because of the systematic nature of the
search, the very large number of galaxies, the long time of observation, and
the fact that non-TDFs were excluded without resorting to assumptions about TDF
characteristics, this study provides an unparalleled opportunity to measure the
TDF rate. To compute the rate of optical stellar tidal disruption events, we
simulate our entire pipeline to obtain the efficiency of detection. The rate
depends on the light curves of TDFs, which are presently still poorly
constrained. Using only the observed part of the SDSS light curves gives a
model-independent upper limit to the optical TDF rate: < 2 10^-4 per year per
galaxy (90% CL). We develop three empirical models of the light curves, based
on the two SDSS light curves and two more recent and better-sampled Pan-STARRS
TDF light curves, leading to our best-estimate of the rate: (1.5 -
2.0)_{-1.3}^{+2.7} 10^-5 per year per galaxy. We explore the modeling
uncertainties by considering two theoretically motivated light curve models, as
well as two different relationships between black hole mass and galaxy
luminosity, and two different treatments of the cutoff in the visibility of
TDFs at large black hole mass. From this we conclude that these sources of
uncertainty are not significantly larger than the statistical ones. Our results
are applicable for galaxies hosting black holes with mass in the range of few
million to 10^8 solar masses, and translates to a volumetric TDF rate of (4 -
8) 10^-8 per year per cubic Mpc.

was the first instrument using fibre Bragg gratings for OH background
suppression. The Bragg gratings reflect the NIR OH lines while being
transparent to light between the lines. This gives a much higher signal-noise
ratio at low resolution but also at higher resolutions by removing the
scattered wings of the OH lines. The specifications call for high throughput
and very low thermal and detector noise so that PRAXIS will remain sky noise
limited. The optical train is made of fore-optics, an IFU, a fibre bundle, the
Bragg grating unit, a second fibre bundle and a spectrograph. GNOSIS used the
pre-existing IRIS2 spectrograph while PRAXIS will use a new spectrograph
specifically designed for the fibre Bragg grating OH suppression and optimised
for 1470 nm to 1700 nm (it can also be used in the 1090 nm to 1260 nm band by
changing the grating and refocussing). This results in a significantly higher
transmission due to high efficiency coatings, a VPH grating at low incident
angle and low absorption glasses. The detector noise will also be lower.
Throughout the PRAXIS design special care was taken at every step along the
optical path to reduce thermal emission or stop it leaking into the system.
This made the spectrograph design challenging because practical constraints
required that the detector and the spectrograph enclosures be physically
separate by air at ambient temperature. At present, the instrument uses the
GNOSIS fibre Bragg grating OH suppression unit. We intend to soon use a new OH
suppression unit based on multicore fibre Bragg gratings which will allow
increased field of view per fibre. Theoretical calculations show that the gain
in interline sky background signal-noise ratio over GNOSIS may very well be as
high as 9 with the GNOSIS OH suppression unit and 17 with the multicore fibre
OH suppression unit.

circular-polarized drive is the shift of the center of the curve to the value
of B for which the Larmour frequency, w_L, is ~B_1^2 w. Magnetic resonance at
w_L~w manifests itself in the derivative, dR/dB. For large L >> l_s the ac
drive affects the Hanle curve if the drive amplitude exceeds the spin
relaxation rate, 1/t_s, i.e. at B_1 t_s > 1. The prime effect of the drive is
the elimination of a minimum in R(B). Linearly polarized drive has a
fundamentally different effect on the Hanle curve, affecting not its shape, but
rather its width.

fluctuation threshold up to which the burst size increases as the fluctuation
increases and that above the threshold, there appears a variety of burst sizes.
We call this threshold the critical threshold. Investigating this threshold in
relation to endogenous bursts and exogenous bursts based on peak ratio and
burst size reveals that the bursts below this threshold are endogenously caused

obtain the asymptotic stability result together with the explicit time-decay

symmetric hyperbolic systems with non-symmetric relaxation. Precisely, the
system is of the type $(p,q)$ if the real part of all eigenvalues admits an
upper bound $-c|\xi|^{2p}/(1+|\xi|^2)^{q}$, where $c$ is a generic positive
constant and $\xi$ is the frequency variable, and the system enjoys the
regularity-loss property if $p<q$. It is well known that the standard type
$(1,1)$ can be assured by the classical Kawashima-Shizuta condition. A new
structural condition was introduced in \cite{UDK} to analyze the
regularity-loss type $(1,2)$ system with non-symmetric relaxation. In the
paper, we construct two more complex models of the regularity-loss type
corresponding to $p=m-3$, $q=m-2$ and $p=(3m-10)/2$, $q=2(m-3)$, respectively,
where $m$ denotes phase dimensions. The proof is based on the delicate Fourier
energy method as well as the suitable linear combination of series of energy
inequalities. Due to arbitrary higher dimensions, it is not obvious to capture
the energy dissipation rate with respect to the degenerate components. Thus,
for each model, the analysis always starts from the case of low phase
dimensions in order to understand the basic dissipative structure in the
general case, and in the mean time, we also give the explicit construction of
the compensating symmetric matrix $K$ and skew-symmetric matrix $S$.

picture of this understanding is developed using Raman spectroscopy monitored
laser heating/annealing and cooling (LHC) experiment at the site of a desired
frequency chosen with the help of Raman mapping, which brings out clear
difference between core and surface (interface) phonons of Si nanocrystals. In
order to further support our attribution of LF being surface (interface)

to the surface Si atoms. This can be considered analogous to the observed
phonon frequencies in the range 495 - 510 cm-1 originating at the Si-SiO2

LF phonons originate at the surface of smaller Si nanocrystals. The

and interacting disk galaxies with different masses and Hubble types by using
chemodynamical simulations with H2 formation on dust grains and dust growth and
destruction in interstellar medium (ISM). We particularly focus on the
dependences of H2 gas mass fractions (f_H2), spatial distributions of HI and
H2, and local H2-scaling relations on initial halo masses (M_h), baryonic
fractions (f_bary), gas mass fractions (f_g), and Hubble types. The principal
results are as follows. The final f_H2 can be larger in disk galaxies with
higher M_h, f_bary, and f_g. Some low-mass disk models with M_h smaller than
10^10 M_sun show extremely low f_H2 and thus no/little star formation, even if
initial f_g is quite large (>0.9). Big galactic bulges can severely suppress
the formation of H2 from HI on dust grains whereas strong stellar bars can not
only enhance f_H2 but also be responsible for the formation of H2-dominated
central rings. The projected radial distributions of H2 are significantly more
compact than those of HI and the simulated radial profiles of H2-to-HI-ratios
(R_mol) follow roughly R^-1.5 in MW-type disk models. Galaxy interaction can
significantly increase f_H2 and total H2 mass in disk galaxies. The local
surface mass densities of H2 can be correlated with those of dust in a galaxy.
The observed correlation between R_mol and gas pressure (R_mol ~ P_g^0.92) can
be well reproduced in the simulated disk galaxies.

parallel computing systems to the masses so increasing the number of potential

evolutions are happening at the ends of the computing spectrum: at the ""small""
scale, processors now include an increasing number of independent execution
units (cores), at the point that a mere CPU can be considered a parallel
shared-memory computer; at the ""large"" scale, the Cloud Computing paradigm
allows applications to scale by offering resources from a large pool on a
pay-as-you-go model. Multi-core processors and Clouds both require applications
to be suitably modified to take advantage of the features they provide. In this
paper, we analyze the state of the art of parallel and distributed simulation
techniques, and assess their applicability to multi-core architectures or
Clouds. It turns out that most of the current approaches exhibit limitations in
terms of usability and adaptivity which may hinder their application to these
new computing architectures. We propose an adaptive simulation mechanism, based
on the multi-agent system paradigm, to partially address some of those
limitations. While it is unlikely that a single approach will work well on both
settings above, we argue that the proposed adaptive mechanism has useful
features which make it attractive both in a multi-core processor and in a Cloud
system. These features include the ability to reduce communication costs by
migrating simulation components, and the support for adding (or removing) nodes
to the execution architecture at runtime. We will also show that, with the help
of an additional support layer, parallel and distributed simulations can be
executed on top of unreliable resources.

variation in polycrystalline, strontium doped indium oxide In2O3:(SrO)x were

low pressure. Gas sensing ability of these compounds as well as the sample
resistance appeared to increase by 4 and 8 orders of the magnitude,
respectively, with the doping level increase from zero up to x=10%. The
conductance variation due to doping is explained by two mechanisms:
acceptor-like electrical activity of Sr as a point defect and appearance of an
additional phase of SrIn2O4. An unusual property of high level (x=10%) doped
samples is a possibility of extraordinarily large and fast oxygen exchange with
ambient atmosphere at not very high temperatures (100-200 C). This peculiarity
is explained by friable structure of crystallite surface. Friable structure
provides relatively fast transition of samples from high to low resistive state
at the expense of high conductance of the near surface layer of the grains.
Microscopic study of the electro-diffusion process at the surface of oxygen
deficient samples allowed estimation of the diffusion coefficient of oxygen
vacancies in the friable surface layer at room temperature as 3x10^(-13)
cm^2/s, which is by one order of the magnitude smaller than that known for

base station (BS) equipped with a large number of antennas and an overlaid
dense tier of small cell access points (SCAs) using a wireless backhaul for
data traffic. The static and low mobility user equipment terminals (UEs) are
associated with the SCAs while those with medium-to-high mobility are served by
the macro BS. A reverse time division duplexing (TDD) protocol is used by the
two tiers, which allows the BS to locally estimate both the intra-tier and
inter-tier channels. This knowledge is then used at the BS either in the uplink
(UL) or in the downlink (DL) to simultaneously serve the macro UEs (MUEs) and
to provide the wireless backhaul to SCAs. A geographical separation of
co-channel SCAs is proposed to limit the interference coming from the UL
signals of MUEs. A concatenated linear precoding technique employing either
zero-forcing (ZF) or regularized ZF is used at the BS to simultaneously serve
MUEs and SCAs in DL while nulling interference toward those SCAs in UL. We
evaluate and characterize the performance of the system through the power
consumption of UL and DL transmissions under the assumption that target rates
must be satisfied and imperfect channel state information is available for
MUEs. The analysis is conducted in the asymptotic regime where the number of BS
antennas and the network size (MUEs and SCAs) grow large with fixed ratios.
Results from large system analysis are used to provide concise formulae for the
asymptotic UL and DL transmit powers and precoding vectors under the above
assumptions. Numerical results are used to validate the analysis in different
settings and to make comparisons with alternative network architectures.

by Emmett and Minion in 2012 is an iterative strategy for the temporal
parallelization of ODEs and discretized PDEs. As the name suggests, PFASST is
similar in spirit to a space-time FAS multigrid method performed over multiple
time-steps in parallel. However, since the original focus of PFASST has been on
the performance of the method in terms of time parallelism, the solution of any
spatial system arising from the use of implicit or semi-implicit temporal
methods within PFASST have simply been assumed to be solved to some desired
accuracy completely at each sub-step and each iteration by some unspecified
procedure. It hence is natural to investigate how iterative solvers in the
spatial dimensions can be interwoven with the PFASST iterations and whether
this strategy leads to a more efficient overall approach. This paper presents
an initial investigation on the relative performance of different strategies
for coupling PFASST iterations with multigrid methods for the implicit
treatment of diffusion terms in PDEs. In particular, we compare full accuracy
multigrid solves at each sub-step with a small fixed number of multigrid
V-cycles. This reduces the cost of each PFASST iteration at the possible
expense of a corresponding increase in the number of PFASST iterations needed
for convergence. Parallel efficiency of the resulting methods is explored
through numerical examples.

steady-state network mean-square deviations (MSDs). We study two classes of
networks: simple networks with a unique transmission path from one node to
another, and arbitrary networks utilizing diffusion consultations over at most
two hops. We propose a method to optimize each node's information neighborhood
subject to local energy budgets and a network-wide energy budget for each
diffusion iteration. This optimization requires the network topology, and the
noise and data variance profiles of each node, and is performed offline before
the diffusion process. In addition, we develop a fully distributed and adaptive
algorithm that approximately optimizes the information neighborhood of each
node with only local energy budget constraints in the case where diffusion
consultations are performed over at most a predefined number of hops. Numerical

completely relativistic for the overlap and exchange corrections and the
description of the bolometer Spectrum. The theoretical expressions are derived
assuming single Slater determinants for the initial Ho and the final Dy Atoms.
Electron capture is proportional to the probability to find the captured
electron in the parent atom at the nucleus. Non-relativistically this is only
possible for ns(1/2) electron states. Relativistically also p(1/2) electrons
have a probability due to the lower part of the relativistic electron spinor,
which does not disappear at the origin. Moreover relativistic effects increase
by contraction the electron probability at the nucleus. Capture from other
states are suppressed. However they can be allowed with smaller intensity due
to finite nuclear size. The purpose of this work is to give a consistent
relativistic formulation and treatment of the overlap and exchange corrections
for electron capture in 163 Ho to excited atomic states in 163 Dy and to show
the influence of the different configurations in the final Dy states. The
overlap and exchange corrections are essential for the calorimetric spectrum of
the deexcitation of the hole states in Dysprosium. The slope of the upper end

mean-field theory, using both Hartree and full continuous-time quantum Monte
Carlo impurity solvers, is used to study the metal-insulator phase diagram of
perovskite transition-metal oxides of the form $AB$O$_3$ with a rare-earth ion
$A$=Sr, La, Y and transition metal $B$=Ti, V, Cr. The correlated subspace is
constructed from atomiclike $d$ orbitals defined using maximally localized
Wannier functions derived from the full $p$-$d$ manifold; for comparison,
results obtained using a projector method are also given. Paramagnetic DFT+DMFT
computations using full charge self-consistency along with the standard ""fully
localized limit"" (FLL) double counting are shown to incorrectly predict that
LaTiO$_3$, YTiO$_3$, LaVO$_3$ and SrMnO$_3$ are metals. A more general
examination of the dependence of physical properties on the mean $p$-$d$ energy
splitting, the occupancy of the correlated $d$ states, the double-counting
correction, and the lattice structure demonstrates the importance of
charge-transfer physics even in the early transition-metal oxides and
elucidates the factors underlying the failure of the standard approximations.
If the double counting is chosen to produce a $p$-$d$ splitting consistent with
experimental spectra, single-site dynamical mean-field theory provides a
reasonable account of the materials properties. The relation of the results to
those obtained from ""$d$-only"" models in which the correlation problem is based
on the frontier orbital $p$-$d$ antibonding bands is determined. It is found
that if an effective interaction $U$ is properly chosen the $d$-only model
provides a good account of the physics of the $d^1$ and $d^2$ materials.

ideal network should have the ability to 1) learn a set of patterns as they
arrive, 2) retrieve the correct patterns from noisy queries, and 3) maximize
the pattern retrieval capacity while maintaining the reliability in responding
to queries. The majority of work on neural associative memories has focused on
designing networks capable of memorizing any set of randomly chosen patterns at
the expense of limiting the retrieval capacity. In this paper, we show that if
we target memorizing only those patterns that have inherent redundancy (i.e.,
belong to a subspace), we can obtain all the aforementioned properties. This is
in sharp contrast with the previous work that could only improve one or two
aspects at the expense of the third. More specifically, we propose framework
based on a convolutional neural network along with an iterative algorithm that
learns the redundancy among the patterns. The resulting network has a retrieval
capacity that is exponential in the size of the network. Moreover, the
asymptotic error correction performance of our network is linear in the size of
the patterns. We then ex- tend our approach to deal with patterns lie
approximately in a subspace. This extension allows us to memorize datasets
containing natural patterns (e.g., images). Finally, we report experimental

sensory representations and control of muscle activities. However, it is not
known how the synaptic efficacies in the neuronal networks of the brain adapt
such that they can reliably generate spikes at specific points in time.
Existing activity-dependent plasticity rules like Spike-Timing-Dependent
Plasticity are agnostic to the goal of learning spike times. On the other hand,
the existing formal and supervised learning algorithms perform a temporally
precise comparison of projected activity with the target, but there is no known
biologically plausible implementation of this comparison. Here, we propose a
simple and local unsupervised synaptic plasticity mechanism that is derived
from the requirement of a balanced membrane potential. Since the relevant
signal for synaptic change is the postsynaptic voltage rather than spike times,
we call the plasticity rule Membrane Potential Dependent Plasticity (MPDP).
Combining our plasticity mechanism with spike after-hyperpolarization causes a
sensitivity of synaptic change to pre- and postsynaptic spike times which can
reproduce Hebbian spike timing dependent plasticity for inhibitory synapses as
was found in experiments. In addition, the sensitivity of MPDP to the time
course of the voltage when generating a spike allows MPDP to distinguish
between weak (spurious) and strong (teacher) spikes, which therefore provides a
neuronal basis for the comparison of actual and target activity. For
spatio-temporal input spike patterns our conceptually simple plasticity rule
achieves a surprisingly high storage capacity for spike associations. The
sensitivity of the MPDP to the subthreshold membrane potential during training

start with Maxwell's mechanical model for electrodynamics, where Maxwell's
equations appear as dynamical consistency conditions. We next take a superfluid
$^3$He-like system as representative of a broad class of fermionic quantum
systems whose low-energy physics reproduces classical electrodynamics (Dirac
and Maxwell equations as dynamical low-energy laws). An important lesson that
can be derived from both analyses is that the vector potential has a
microscopic physical reality and that it is only in the low-energy regime that
this physical reality is blurred in favour of gauge invariance, which in
addition turns out to be secondary to effective Lorentz invariance.

context-specific metabolic networks (FASTCORE) that allowed dropping the
reconstruction time to the time order of seconds (Vlassis et al.,2014). This
extremely low computational demand opens new possibilities for improving the
quality of the models. Several rounds of model reconstruction, testing of the
model's predictions against real experimental data, curation steps of the input
model and the set of core reactions as well as cross-validations assays are
required to reconstruct high-quality models. These semi-automated model
curations steps are in such extend not possible with competing algorithms due
to their high computational demands. To adapt FASTCORE for the integration of
microarray data, we therefore propose a new workflow: FASTCORMICS. FASTCORMICS
requires as input microarray data and a Genome-scale reconstruction.
FASTCORMICS is devoid of heuristic parameter settings and has a low
computational demand with overall building times in the order of a few minutes.
FASTCORMICS preprocesses the microarrays data with the discretization tool
Barcode (Zillox et al, 2007). Barcode uses prior knowledge on the intensity
distribution of each probe set for a given microarray platform to segregate
between expressed genes and non-expressed genes. This preprocessing step allows
circumventing the need of setting a heuristic expression threshold, which is
critical for the output models as in response to this threshold alternative
pathways or subsystems might be included or excluded, thereby heavily changing
the functionalities of the model.
  In general, FASTCORMICS outperforms competing algorithms and allows obtaining
high-quality, robust models in a high-throughput manner. This will allow the
use of metabolic modelling as routine process for the analysis of microarray
data e.g. in the field of personalized medicine.

bulk transport would have been expected to coexist already. Moreover, the
density dependence of the Dirac-type quantum Hall effect allows to identify the
contributions from the individual surfaces. A $k \cdot p$ model can describe
the experiments, but only when assuming a steep band bending across the regions
where the topological surface states are contained. This steep potential
originates from the specific screening properties of Dirac systems and causes
the gate voltage to influence the position of the Dirac points rather than that

understanding of such a competition in a metal whose Fermi surface has a
non-trivial topology is yet to be achieved. Here, we address this question in a
prototypical system: the 2D Rashba semimetal. We show that dominant
superconductivity interplays with Rashba spin orbit interactions (SOI) in
forming a novel intrinsic anomalous Hall effect (AHE) with gapless edge states
of Bogoliubov-de Gennes (BdG) quasiparticles. As in the case of itinerant
ferromagnets, the intrinsic AHE arises from Berry curvature effects in the band
structure. This phenomenon is robust even as sub-dominant ferromagnetism
dramatically changes the nature of pairing symmetry. An emergent spin Hall
phase involving a change in Fermi-surface topology is found to accompany this
Lifshitz quantum phase transition. We demonstrate the coexistence of the
original and novel AHE in the presence of weak disorder. We offer a comparison
of our results with experiments on the two dimensional electron gas at oxide
hetero-interfaces as well as make some testable predictions.

decay mode is dominant, no dedicated search has been performed in the past. By
taking into account characteristic signals of $H^{\pm\pm}$ in the diboson decay
scenario at LEP and the LHC experiments, we find that the lower mass bound of
60-68 GeV can be obtained using the same-sign dilepton search performed by
ATLAS Collaboration with 4.7 fb$^{-1}$ data at the collision energy of 7 TeV.
We also show that the limit can be extended up to about 85-90 GeV, assuming the
integrated luminosity of 20 fb$^{-1}$ and 7 TeV for the collision energy. We
give detailed explanations on the decay properties of $H^{\pm\pm}$ for
relatively small mass cases and also on production cross sections of
$H^{\pm\pm}$ at the next-to-leading order of QCD at the LHC.

emission of large dust grains in the HD 169142 protoplanetary disk. Our images
show a ring of enhanced emission of radius ~25-30 AU, whose inner region is
devoid of detectable 7 mm emission. We interpret this ring as tracing the rim
of an inner cavity or gap, possibly created by a planet or a substellar
companion. The ring appears asymmetric, with the western part significantly
brighter than the eastern one. This azimuthal asymmetry is reminiscent of the
lopsided structures that are expected to be produced as a consequence of
trapping of large dust grains. Our observations also reveal an outer annular
gap at radii from ~40 to ~70 AU. Unlike other sources, the radii of the inner
cavity, the ring, and the outer gap observed in the 7 mm images, which trace
preferentially the distribution of large (mm/cm sized) dust grains, coincide
with those obtained from a previous near-infrared polarimetric image, which
traces scattered light from small (micron- sized) dust grains. We model the
broad-band spectral energy distribution and the 7 mm images to constrain the
disk physical structure. From this modeling we infer the presence of a small
(radius ~0.6 AU) residual disk inside the central cavity, indicating that the
HD 169142 disk is a pre-transitional disk. The distribution of dust in three
annuli with gaps in between them suggests that the disk in HD 169142 is being
disrupted by at least two planets or substellar objects.

the fixed string and a suffix of most recent symbols of the stream is reported.
The cell-probe model is perhaps the strongest model of computation for showing
data structure lower bounds, subsuming in particular the popular word-RAM
model.
  * We first give an $\Omega((\delta \log n)/(w+\log\log n))$ lower bound for
the time to give each output for both online Hamming distance and convolution,
where $w$ is the word size. This bound relies on a new encoding scheme and for
the first time holds even when $w$ is as small as a single bit.
  * We then consider the online edit distance and longest common subsequence
problems in the bit-probe model ($w=1$) with a constant sized input alphabet.
We give a lower bound of $\Omega(\sqrt{\log n}/(\log\log n)^{3/2})$ which
applies for both problems. This second set of results relies both on our new
encoding scheme as well as a carefully constructed hard distribution.
  * Finally, for the online edit distance problem we show that there is an
$O((\log n)^2/w)$ upper bound in the cell-probe model. This bound gives a
contrast to our new lower bound and also establishes an exponential gap between

underwent instability: two with a constant positive anisotropy, one with an
anisotropic core and an isotropic envelope and one with a very small isotropic
core and an anisotropic envelope. Haloes affected by the instability become
approximately axisymmetric and prolate, with the profile of the
shortest-to-longest axis ratio increasing with radius. The lower limit for the
central value of this axis ratio is 0.3 for an NFW halo. The density profiles
of the haloes did not change significantly, whereas the velocity distributions
became axisymmetric. The total angular momentum rose due to large-amplitude
oscillations of its components perpendicular to the symmetry axis of the halo.
We also studied orbits of individual particles assigning them to classical
orbit families in triaxial potentials. We find that the membership of a given
particle in a family depends on its initial total angular momentum and its

grains. In the analysis of observations of protoplanetary disks the dust phase
is often assumed to consist of spherical grains, allowing one to apply the Mie
scattering formalism. However, in reality, the shape of dust grains is expected
to deviate strongly from that of a sphere. We investigate the influence of
porous dust grains on the temperature distribution and observable appearance of
protoplanetary disks for dust grain porosities of up to 60 %. We performed
radiative transfer modeling to simulate the temperature distribution, spectral
energy distribution, and spatially resolved intensity and polarization maps.
The optical properties of porous grains were calculated using the method of
discrete dipole approximation. We find that the flux in the optical wavelength
range is for porous grains higher than for compact, spherical grains. The
profile of the silicate peak at 9.7 um strongly depends on the degree of grain
porosity. The temperature distribution shows significant changes in the
direction perpendicular to the midplane. Moreover, simulated polarization maps
reveal an increase of the polarization degree by a factor of about four when
porous grains are considered, regardless of the disk inclination. The
polarization direction is reversed in selected disk regions, depending on the
wavelength, grain porosity, and disk inclination. We discuss several possible
explanations of this effect and find that multiple scattering explains the
effect best. Porosity influences the observable appearance of protoplanetary
disks. In particular, the polarization reversal shows a dependence on grain
porosity. The physical conditions within the disk are altered by porosity,
which might have an effect on the processes of grain growth and disk evolution.

their field-lines, whereas others are confined by their field-lines; ii)
upstream clouds may accelerate past downstream clouds (though magnetic tension
can prevent this); iii) clouds may also change their relative positions
transverse to the direction of shock propagation as they ""slingshot"" past each

flow as a result of being in the lee of an upstream cloud; v) the cycle of
cloud compression and re-expansion is generally weaker when there are nearby
neighbouring clouds; vi) the plasma $\beta$ in cloud material can vary rapidly

transitory.

and common formulations of static network epidemiology, there is a
deterministic relationship between R0 and {\Omega}. However, if one considers
disease spreading on a temporal contact network -- where one knows when
contacts happen, not only between whom -- then larger R0 does not necessarily
imply larger {\Omega}. In this paper, we numerically investigate the
relationship between R0 and {\Omega} for a set of empirical temporal networks

Next, we analytically derive and characterize an achievable rate region for the

low power regimes and is a target performance measure in energy efficient

velocities of stars from their spectral line profiles. However, its domain of
validity does not include line-profile variables with time-dependent profiles.
We investigate the performance of the method for such cases, by interpreting
the line-profile variations of spotted B stars, and of pulsating B tars, as if
their spectral lines were caused by uniform surface rotation along with
macroturbulence. We perform time-series analysis and harmonic least-squares
fitting of various line diagnostics and of the outcome of several
implementations of the Fourier Transform method. We find that the projected
rotational velocities derived from the Fourier Transform vary appreciably
during the pulsation cycle whenever the pulsational and rotational velocity
fields are of similar magnitude. The macroturbulent velocities derived while
ignoring the pulsations can vary with tens of km/s during the pulsation cycle.
The temporal behaviour of the deduced rotational and macroturbulent velocities
are in antiphase with each other. The rotational velocity is in phase with the
second moment of the line profiles. The application of the Fourier method to
stars with considerable pulsational line broadening may lead to an appreciable
spread in the values of the rotation velocity, and, by implication, of the
deduced value of the macroturbulence. These two quantities should therefore not
be derived from single snapshot spectra if the aim is to use them as a solid
diagnostic for the evaluation of stellar evolution models of slow to moderate
rotators.

ranging from low temperature Bose-Einstein condensations to grand unification
scales in particle physics and cosmology and from classical phase transitions
to quantum phase transitions. Here we show that finite-time scaling (FTS)
provides a detailed improved understanding of the mechanism. In particular, the
finite time scale, which is introduced by the external driving (or quenching)
and results in FTS, is the origin of the division of the adiabatic regimes from
the impulse regime in the KZ mechanism. The origin of the KZ scaling for the
defect density, generated during the driving through a critical point, is not
that the correlation length ceases growing in the nonadiabatic impulse regime,
but rather, is that it is taken over by the effective finite length scale
corresponding to the finite time scale. We also show that FTS accounts well for
and improves the scaling ansatz proposed recently by Liu, Polkovnikov, and
Sandvik [Phys. Rev. B {\bf 89}, 054307 (2014)]. Further, we show that their
universal power-law scaling form applies only to some observables in cooling
but not to heating. Even in cooling, it is invalid either when an appropriate
external field is present. However, this finite-time-finite-size scaling calls
for caution in application of FTS. Detailed scaling behaviors of the FTS and
finite-size scaling, along with their crossover, are explicitly demonstrated,
with the dynamic critical exponent $z$ being estimated for two- and
three-dimensional Ising models under the usual Metropolis dynamics. These
values of $z$ are found to give rise to better data collapses than the extant
values do in most cases but take on different values in heating and cooling in

Gyr. New X-ray cavities are detected in three sources. We focus on the subset

galactic nucleus (AGN) duty cycle is approximately 61 percent (30/49). This
rises to over 80 percent for a central cooling time of less than 0.5 Gyr. When
projection effects and central radio source detection rates are considered, the
actual duty cycle is probably much higher. In addition, we show that data
quality strongly affects the detection rates of X-ray cavities. After
calculating the cooling luminosity and cavity powers of each source with
cavities, it is evident that the bubbling process induced by the central AGN
has to be, on average, continuous, to offset cooling. We find that the radius
of the cavities, r, loosely depends on the ambient gas temperature as T^0.5,
above about 1.5 keV, with much more scatter below that temperature. Finally, we
show that, at a given location in a group or cluster, larger bubbles travel

This system is different from typical PCEBs not only because of the G-type

whether the existence of KOI-3278 provides new observational constraints on
theories of CE evolution. We reconstruct its evolutionary history and predict
its future using BSE, clarifying the proper use of the binding energy parameter

source of extra energy, is required to reconstruct the evolutionary history of
KOI-3278. Using BSE we derive progenitor system parameters of M1,i = 2.450
Msun, M2,i = 1.034 Msun, and Porb,i ~ 1300 d. We also find that in ~9 Gyr the
system will go through a second CE phase leaving behind a double WD, consisting
of a C/O WD and a He WD with masses of 0.636 Msun and 0.332 Msun, respectively.
After IK Peg, KOI-3278 is the second PCEB that clearly requires an extra source
of energy, beyond that of orbital energy, to contribute to the CE ejection.
Both systems are special in that they have long orbital periods and massive
secondaries. This may also indicate that the CE efficiency increases with
secondary mass.

particle dark matter, i.e. indirect detection (dark matter annihilating into
standard model particles) or direct detection (dark matter particles scattering
in deep underground detectors) are discussed. One particular aspect of these
searches is the presence of very large uncertainties in nuisance parameters
(astrophysical factors) that are degenerate with parameters of interest (mass
and annihilation/decay cross sections for the particles). The likelihood
approach has become the most powerful tool, offering at least one well
motivated method for incorporation of nuisance parameters and increasing the
sensitivity of experiments by allowing a combination of targets superior to the
more traditional data stacking. Other statistical challenges appearing in
astrophysical searches are to large extent similar to any new physics search,
for example at colliders, a prime example being the calculation of trial
factors. Frequentist methods prevail for hypothesis testing and interval
estimation, Bayesian methods are used for assessment of nuisance parameters and
parameter estimation in complex parameter spaces. The basic statistical
concepts will be exposed, illustrated with concrete examples from experimental
searches and caveats will be pointed out.

formalism is defined to consistently incorporate three-body forces in the
many-body calculations. The effect of three-nucleon interactions is included
via the construction of a dressed two-body density dependent force. This is
obtained performing an average of the leading order three-body terms in the
chiral effective field theory expansion. The dressed force corresponds to the
use of an in-medium propagator in the average which takes into account the
correlations characterizing the system at each stage of the many-body
calculation. The total energy of the system is obtained by means of a modified
Galitskii-Migdal-Koltun sumrule to correctly account for the effect of
three-body forces. Microscopic as well as macroscopic properties of symmetric

below a dissipative scale $l_d$. It is demonstrated that the stability of the
flow with respect to growth of fluctuations with scale smaller than $l_d$ leads
to a non-trivial constraint. That involves the dimensionless strength $Fl$ of
fluctuations of the gradients of the scalar in the direction of gravity and the
Rayleigh scale $L$ depending on the Rayleigh number $Ra$, the Nusselt number
$Nu$ and $l_d$. The constraint implies that the stratified fluid at rest, which
is linearly stable, develops instability in the limit of large $Ra$. This
limits observability of solution for the flow around small swimmer in quiescent
stratified fluid that has closed streamlines at scale $L$ [A. M. Ardekani and
R. Stocker, Phys. Rev. Lett. 105, 084502 (2010)]. Correspondingly to study the
flow at scale $L$ one has to take turbulence into account. We demonstrate that
the resulting turbulent flow around small particles or swimmers can be
described by scalar integro-differential advection-diffusion equation.
Describing the solutions we show that closed streamlines persist with finite
probability. Our results seem to be the necessary basis in understanding flows
around small swimmers.

execute unmodified critical sections concurrently, even if they are protected
by the same lock. To ensure correctness, the transactions used to execute these
critical sections ""subscribe"" to the lock by reading it and checking that it is
available. A recent paper proposed using the tempting ""lazy subscription""
optimization for a similar technique in a different context, namely
transactional systems that use a single global lock (SGL) to protect all
transactional data. We identify several pitfalls that show that lazy
subscription \emph{is not safe} for TLE because unmodified critical sections
executing before subscribing to the lock may behave incorrectly in a number of
subtle ways. We also show that recently proposed compiler support for modifying
transaction code to ensure subscription occurs before any incorrect behavior
could manifest is not sufficient to avoid all of the pitfalls we identify. We
further argue that extending such compiler support to avoid all pitfalls would
add substantial complexity and would usually limit the extent to which
subscription can be deferred, undermining the effectiveness of the
optimization. Hardware extensions suggested in the recent proposal also do not
address all of the pitfalls we identify. In this extended version of our WTTM
2014 paper, we describe hardware extensions that make lazy subscription safe,
both for SGL-based transactional systems and for TLE, without the need for
special compiler support. We also explain how nontransactional loads can be
exploited, if available, to further enhance the effectiveness of lazy
subscription.

of accuracy and diversity of the CF algorithm. The numerical results for two
benchmark data sets, MovieLens and Netflix, show that the accuracy of the new

algorithm based on random-walks proposed in the Ref.7, the average ranking
score could reach 0.0767 and 0.0402, which is enhanced by 27.3\% and 19.1\% for

where $\mathcal{Q}$ and $M$ are black hole charge and mass, respectively, with
the derived expression. An introduction of a negative tidal charge $q$ can
describe black hole solutions in theories with extra dimensions, so following
the approach we consider an opportunity to extend RN metric to negative
