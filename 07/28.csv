algorithmic quantum simulation of arbitrary qudit channels on fault-tolerant
quantum computers within a pre-specified error tolerance with respect to
diamond-norm distance. The classical algorithm is constructed by decomposing a
quantum channel into a convex combination of generalized extreme channels by
optimization of a set of nonlinear coupled algebraic equations. The resultant
circuit is a randomly chosen generalized extreme channel circuit whose run-time
is logarithmic with respect to the error tolerance and quadratic with respect
to Hilbert space dimension, which requires only a single ancillary qudit plus
classical dits.

the inverse transition temperature of the very strong temperature-driven
first-order phase transition that is apparent in the system. Multicanonical
simulations of this model allow us to measure system configurations that are
suppressed by more than 60 orders of magnitude compared to probable states.
With the resulting high-precision data, we find excellent agreement with our
recently proposed nonstandard finite-size scaling laws for models with a
macroscopic degeneracy of the low-temperature phase by challenging the
prefactors numerically. We find an overall consistent inverse transition
temperature of 0.551334(8) from the simulations of the original model both with
periodic and fixed boundary conditions, and the dual model with periodic
boundary conditions. For the original model with periodic boundary conditions,
we obtain the first reliable estimate of the interface tension, 0.12037(18),

single-molecule investigations under equilibrium conditions, for which free

determine with ensemble-averaging alone. Here, we provide a method to access
single-molecule thermodynamics, by confining an individual molecule to a
nanoscopic pore of a two-dimensional metal-organic nanomesh, where we directly
record finite-temperature time-averaged statistical weights using
temperature-controlled scanning tunneling microscopy. The obtained patterns
represent a real space equilibrium probability distribution. We associate this
distribution with a partition function projection to assess spatially resolved
thermodynamic quantities, by means of computational modeling. The presented
molecular dynamics based Boltzmann weighting model is able to reproduce
experimentally observed molecular states with high accuracy. By an in-silico

provides means to encode and decode information into position-temperature space

personalization has become a critical factor for the success of services that
wish to leverage the power of Web 2.0. However, the relevance, significance and
impact of tailored content delivery in the learning domain is still
questionable. Apart from considering only interaction based features like
ratings and inferring learner preferences from them, if these services were to
incorporate innate user profile attributes which affect learning activities,
the quality of recommendations produced could be vastly improved. Recognizing
the crucial role of effective guidance in informal educational settings, we
provide a principled way of utilizing multiple sources of information from the
user profile itself for the recommendation task. We explore factors that affect
the choice of learning resources and explain in what way are they helpful to
improve the pedagogical accuracy of learning objects recommended. Through a
systematical application of machine learning techniques, we further provide a
technological solution to convert these indirectly mapped learner specific
attributes into a direct mapping with the learning resources. This mapping has
a distinct advantage of tagging learning resources to make their metadata more
informative. The results of our empirical study depict the similarity of
nominal learning attributes with respect to each other. We further succeed in
capturing the learner subset, whose preferences are most likely to be an
indication of learning resource usage. Our novel system filters learner profile
attributes to discover a tag that links them with learning resources.

sight structure of the sky-projected Galactic magnetic field. Two example
lines-of-sight are decomposed: toward a field with many red clump stars and
toward a field with few red clump stars. A continuous estimate of magnetic
field orientation over several kiloparsecs of distance is possible in the field
with many red clump stars, while only discrete estimates are possible in the
sparse example. toward the Outer Galaxy, there is a continuous field
orientation with distance that shows evidence of perturbation by the Galactic

on their work, Balcan et al. [COLT'12] and Badanidiyuru et al. [SODA'12] show
that if $v$ is subadditive then there exists an $\tilde O(\sqrt n)$-sketch that
can be constructed using polynomially many demand queries. All previous
sketches are based on complicated geometric constructions. The first step in
their constructions is proving the existence of a good sketch by finding an
ellipsoid that ``approximates'' $v$ well (this is done by applying John's
theorem to ensure the existence of an ellipsoid that is ``close'' to the
polymatroid that is associated with $v$). The second step is showing this
ellipsoid can be found efficiently, and this is done by repeatedly solving a
certain convex program to obtain better approximations of John's ellipsoid.
  In this paper, we give a much simpler, non-geometric proof for the existence
of good sketches, and utilize the proof to obtain much faster algorithms that
match the previously obtained approximation bounds. Specifically, we provide an
algorithm that finds $\tilde O(\sqrt n)$-sketch of a submodular function with
only $\tilde O(n^\frac{3}{2})$ value queries, and an algorithm that finds
$\tilde O(\sqrt n)$-sketch of a subadditive function with $O(n)$ demand and
value queries.

positions (for different volatile species) in the disc, and chemical
compositions and mass ratios of ice relative to rock for icy planetesimals in

planetesimals were produced as a function of the mass of the disc and distance

CO2, CH3OH, and NH3. The ice/rock mass ratio is equal to 1+-0.5 in icy
planetesimals following assumptions. This last value is in good agreement with
observations of solar system comets, but remains lower than usual assumptions
made in planet formation models, taking this ratio to be of 2-3.

addresses these security issues, in addition to offering good memorability.
Motivated by psychology research on humans' cognitive strengths and weaknesses,
we explore the potential of cognitive questions as a way to address the major
challenges in user authentication. We design, implement, and evaluate Q-A, a
novel cognitive-question-based password system that requires a user to enter
the letter at a given position in her answer for each of six personal questions
(e.g. ""What is the name of your favorite childhood teacher?""). In this scheme,
the user does not need to memorize new, artificial information as her
authentication secret. Our scheme offers 28 bits of theoretical password space,
which has been found sufficient to prevent online brute-force attacks. Q-A is
also robust against shoulder surfing and keystroke loggers. We conducted a
multi-session in-lab user study to evaluate the usability of Q-A; 100% of users
were able to remember their Q-A password over the span of one week, although
login times were high. We compared our scheme with random six character
passwords and found that login success rate in Q-A was significantly higher.
Based on our results, we suggest that Q-A would be most appropriate in contexts
that demand high security and where logins occur infrequently (e.g., online
bank accounts).

(GEM) loaded gaseous detector developed for precision measurements of
high-energy particle beams and dose-verification measurements. In the present
study, a 256-channel prototype detector with an active area of 16$\times$16
cm$^{2}$, operated in a continuous current-integration-mode signal-processing
method, was manufactured and tested with x rays emitted from a 70-kV x-ray
generator and 43-MeV protons provided by the MC50 proton cyclotron at the Korea
Institute of Radiological and Medical Science (KIRAMS). The amplified detector
response was measured for the x rays with an intensity of about
5$\times$10$^{6}$ Hz cm$^{-2}$. The linearity of the detector response to the
particle flux was examined and validated by using 43-MeV proton beams. The
non-uniform development of the amplification for the gas electrons in space was
corrected by applying proper calibration to the channel responses of the
measured beam-profile data. We concluded from the radiation tests that the
detector developed in the present study will allow us to perform quality
measurements of various high-energy particle beams and to apply the technology
to dose verification measurements in particle therapy.

the energy conditions are formulated self-consistently. The former allow a
uniquely determined dynamical evolution of the system, and the latter guarantee
that causality is preserved and that ""plausible"" physical sources have been
considered. In this work, we consider the further degrees of freedom related to
curvature invariants and scalar fields in Extended Theories of Gravity (ETG).
These new degrees of freedom can be recast as effective perfect fluids that
carry different meanings with respect to the standard matter fluids generally
adopted as sources of the field equations. It is thus somewhat misleading to
apply the standard general relativistic energy conditions to this effective
energy-momentum, as the latter contains the matter content and a geometrical
quantity, which arises from the ETG considered. Here, we explore this subtlety,
extending on previous work, in particular, to cases with the contracted Bianchi
identities with diffeomorphism invariance and to cases with generalized
explicit curvature-matter couplings, which imply the non-conservation of the
energy-momentum tensor. Furthermore, we apply the analysis to specific ETGs,
such as scalar-tensor gravity, $f(R)$ gravity and modified Gauss-Bonnet
gravity. Interesting results appear such as matter that may exhibit unusual
thermodynamical features, for instance, and gravity that retains its attractive
character in the presence of negative pressures; or alternatively, we verify
that repulsive gravity may occur for standard matter.

better then 5% at $z=0$. However, the simulation results are better fit by an
ellipsoidal collapse model at $z=0.7$. We highlight, for the first time,
another potentially serious systematic due to a sampling bias in the halo
velocity divergence power spectra which will affect the comparison between
observations and any redshift space distortion model which assumes dark matter
velocity statistics with no velocity bias. By measuring the velocity divergence
power spectra for different sized halo samples, we find that there is a
significant bias which increases with decreasing number density. This bias is
approximately 20% at $k=0.1h$Mpc$^{-1}$ for a halo sample of number density
$\bar{n} = 10^{-3} (h/$Mpc$)^3$ at both $z=0$ and $z=0.7$ for the velocity
divergence auto power spectrum. Given the importance of redshift space
distortions as a probe of dark energy and the on-going major effort to advance

sources, J1502SE/SW, offset by 26 mas (140 pc), with each source being
energized by its own supermassive black hole (BH). This intriguing
interpretation of a close binary BH was reached after ruling out a
double-hotspot scenario, wherein both hotspots are energized by a single,
central BH, a configuration occuring in the well-studied Compact Symmetric

with double hotspots should have an edge-brightened structure. We report

VLBA tests of that scenario. A double-hotspot scenario could have broad
implications for feedback in obscured AGNs. We also report a VLBA detection of

  The Stochastic Monotonicity Assumption",,,,,"stat.ME","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The instrumental variables (IV) method is a method for making causal
inferences about the effect of a treatment based on an observational study in
which there are unmeasured confounding variables. The method requires a valid
IV, a variable that is independent of the unmeasured confounding variables and
is associated with the treatment but which has no effect on the outcome beyond
its effect on the treatment. An additional assumption that is often made for
the IV method is deterministic monotonicity, which is an assumption that for
each subject, the level of the treatment that a subject would take if given a
level of the IV is a monotonic increasing function of the level of the IV.
Under deterministic monotonicity, the IV method identifies the average
treatment effect for the compliers (those subject who would take the treatment
if encouraged to do so by the IV and not take the treatment if not encouraged).
However, deterministic monotonicity is sometimes not realistic. We introduce a
stochastic monotonicity condition which relaxes deterministic monotonicity in
that it does not require that a monotonic increasing relationship hold within
subjects between the levels of the IV and the level of the treatment that the
subject would take if given a level of the IV, but only that a monotonic
increasing relationship hold across subjects between the IV and the treatment
in a certain manner. We show that under stochastic monotonicity, the IV method
identifies a weighted average of treatment effects with greater weight on
subgroups of subjects on whom the IV has a stronger effect. We provide bounds
on the global average treatment effect under stochastic monotonicity and a
sensitivity analysis for violations of the stochastic monotonicity assumption.

respect to the roughness of the forcing noise. However, its Cole-Hopf solution,
defined as the logarithm of the solution of the linear stochastic heat equation
(SHE) with a multiplicative noise, is a mathematically well-defined object. In
fact, Hairer [13] has recently proved that the solution of SHE can actually be
derived through the Cole-Hopf transform of the solution of the KPZ equation
with a suitable renormalization under periodic boundary conditions. This
transformation is unfortunately not well adapted to studying the invariant
measures of these Markov processes.
  The present paper introduces a different type of regularization for the KPZ
equation on the whole line $\mathbb{R}$ or under periodic boundary conditions,
which is appropriate from the viewpoint of studying the invariant measures. The
Cole-Hopf transform applied to this equation leads to an SHE with a smeared
noise having an extra complicated nonlinear term. Under time average and in the
stationary regime, it is shown that this term can be replaced by a simple
linear term, so that the limit equation is the linear SHE with an extra linear
term with coefficient 1/24. The methods are essentially stochastic analytic:
The Wiener-It\^o expansion and a similar method for establishing the
Boltzmann-Gibbs principle are used. As a result, it is shown that the
distribution of a two-sided geometric Brownian motion with a height shift given
by Lebesgue measure is invariant under the evolution determined by the SHE on
$\mathbb{R}$.

these deviations were caused by high C and O elemental abundances in their

dwarf atmospheres with various elemental abundance patterns, and investigate
the variations of the molecular composition, thermal structure and their
effects to the near-infrared spectra between 1.0 and 5.0 {\mu}m. The 4.2 {\mu}m
CO_2 absorption band in some late-L and T dwarfs taken by AKARI are stronger or
weaker than predictions by corresponding models with solar abundance. By
comparing CO_2 band in the model spectra to the observed near-infrared spectra,
we confirm possible elemental abundance variations among brown dwarfs. We find
that the band strength is especially sensitive to O abundance, but C is also
needed to reproduce the entire near-infrared spectra. This result indicates
that both C and O abundances should increase and decrease simultaneously for
brown dwarfs. We find that a weaker CO_2 absorption band in a spectrum can also
be explained by a model with lower C and O abundances.

VWAP pricing problem is set in an incomplete market since there is no

volume risk which must be determined from the corresponding volume statistics.

signal in the angular correlation function (ACF) at $\sim4\sigma$,
corresponding to a real-space correlation length
$r_{0}=6.7^{+0.9}_{-1.0}h^{-1}$cMpc. The derived galaxy bias
$b=8.6^{+0.9}_{-1.0}$ is that of dark-matter halos of
$M=10^{11.1^{+0.2}_{-0.3}}$M$_{\odot}$ at $z=7.2$, and highlights that galaxies
below the current detection limit ($M_{AB}\sim-17.7$) are expected in
lower-mass halos ($M\sim10^{8}-10^{10.5}$M$_{\odot}$). We compute the ACF of
LBGs at $z\sim3.8-z\sim5.9$ in the same surveys. A trend of increasing bias is
found from $z=3.8$ ($b\sim3.0$) to $z=7.2$ ($b\sim8.6$), broadly consistent
with galaxies at fixed luminosity being hosted in dark-matter halos of similar
mass at $4<z<6$, followed by a slight rise in halo masses at $z\sim7$
($\sim2\sigma$ confidence). Separating the data at the median luminosity of the

a constant mass-to-light ratio $\frac{dlogM}{dlogL}\sim1.2^{+1.8}_{-0.8}$. A
similar trend is present in the $z=7.2$ sample with larger uncertainty.
Finally, our bias measurements allow us to investigate the fraction of
dark-matter halos hosting UV-bright galaxies (the duty-cycle, $\epsilon_{DC}$).
At $z=7.2$ values near unity are preferred, which may be explained by the

AGN in clusters to examine how local environment affects the presence of an AGN

that the radial distribution of AGN generally differs from that of normal
galaxies. AGN host galaxies also show a different colour distribution than
normal galaxies, with many AGN hosts displaying galaxy colours in the ""green
valley"" between the red sequence and blue star-forming normal galaxies. This
result is similar to those found in field galaxy studies. The colour
distribution of AGN hosts is more pronounced in disturbed clusters where minor
mergers, galaxy harassment, and interactions with cluster substructure may
continue to prompt star-formation in the hosts. However, we find no
relationship between host galaxy colour and cluster radius among AGN hosts.
This may indicate that processes related to the accreting supermassive black
hole have a greater impact on the star-forming properties of the host galaxy
than the intracluster medium and/or local galaxy environment.

long been known that the Price of Anarchy (PoA) of this game is not 1, since
the Nash equilibrium (NE) where all players take B (B Nash) is inferior to the

performed to give an accurate upper bound of PoA in this game.
  In this paper, we adopt a widely used networked coordination game setting [3]
to study how bad a Nash equilibrium can be and give a tight upper bound of the
PoA of such games. We show that there is an NE that is slightly worse than the
B Nash. On the other hand, the PoA is bounded and the worst NE cannot be much
worse than the B Nash. In addition, we discuss how the PoA upper bound would
change when compatibility between A and B is introduced, and show an intuitive

When the atomic spin-orbit coupling (SOC) is taken into account, a gap is
opened resulting in a quantum spin Hall effect state. As revealed explicitly by
a $k\cdot p$ model, the topology is associated with a meron structure in the
pseudo spin texture with vorticity two, a mechanism different from honeycomb
lattice and the band inversion. One possible realization of this scheme is the
1/3 coverage by Bi atom adapted on the Si[111] surface. First-principle

With the Si substrate taking part in realizing the nontrivial topology, the

this paper, we extend the discussions to the case of modified gravity (MG), by
considering Dvali-Gabadadze-Porrati (DGP) model, power-law type $f(T)$ model
and exponential type $f(T)$ model. In addition to the SNLS3 data, we also use
the latest Planck distance priors data, the galaxy clustering (GC) data
extracted from Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) data release 7 (DR7) and Baryon
Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS), as well as the direct measurement of
Hubble constant $H_0$ from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) observation. We
find that, for both cases of using the supernova (SN) data alone and using the
combination of all data, adding a parameter of $\beta$ can reduce $\chi^2$ by
$\sim$ 36 for all the MG models, showing that a constant $\beta$ is ruled out
at 6$\sigma$ confidence level (CL). Moreover, we find that a time-varying
$\beta$ always yields a larger fractional matter density $\Omega_{m0}$ and a
smaller reduced Hubble constant $h$; in addition, it significantly changes the
shapes of 1$\sigma$ and 2$\sigma$ confidence regions of various MG models, and
thus corrects systematic bias for the parameter estimation. These conclusions
are consistent with the results of DE models, showing that $\beta$'s evolution
is completely independent of the cosmological models in the background.
Therefore, our work highlights the importance of considering the evolution of
$\beta$ in the cosmology-fits.

European options with large discrete dividends was popular since early 2000's
with a few different approaches reported during the last 10 years. Moreover, it
has been claimed that at least some of the resulting expressions represent
high-quality approximations which closely match results obtained by the use of
numerics.
  In this paper we review, on the one hand, these previously suggested
Black-Scholes type approximations and, on the other hand, different versions of
the corresponding Crank-Nicolson numerical schemes with a primary focus on
their boundary condition variations. Unexpectedly we often observe substantial
deviations between the analytical and numerical results which may be especially
pronounced for European Puts. Moreover, our analysis demonstrates that any
Black-Scholes type approximation which adjusts Put parameters identically to
Call parameters has an inherent problem of failing to detect a little known
Put-Call Parity violation phenomenon. To address this issue we derive a new
analytic approximation which is in a better agreement with the corresponding
numerical results in comparison with any of the previously known analytic
approaches for European Calls and Puts with large discrete dividends.

Diagnostic (CAD) systems for improving the reliability and consistency of

Human Epithelial Type 2 (HEp-2) cells. While prior works have primarily focused
on classifying cell images extracted from ANA specimen images, this work takes
a further step by focussing on the specimen image classification problem
itself. Our system is able to efficiently classify specimen images as well as
producing meaningful descriptions of ANA pattern class which helps physicians
to understand the differences between various ANA patterns. We achieve this
goal by designing a specimen-level image descriptor that: (1) is highly
discriminative; (2) has small descriptor length and (3) is semantically
meaningful at the cell level. In our work, a specimen image descriptor is
represented by its overall cell attribute descriptors. As such, we propose two
max-margin based learning schemes to discover cell attributes whilst still
maintaining the discrimination of the specimen image descriptor. Our learning
schemes differ from the existing discriminative attribute learning approaches
as they primarily focus on discovering image-level attributes. Comparative
evaluations were undertaken to contrast the proposed approach to various
state-of-the-art approaches on a novel HEp-2 cell dataset which was
specifically proposed for the specimen-level classification. Finally, we
showcase the ability of the proposed approach to provide textual descriptions
to explain ANA patterns.

understanding this structure are to increase the number of reliable spiral

regions, giant molecular clouds (GMCs), and 6.7-GHz methanol masers are closely
related to high mass star formation, and hence they are excellent spiral
tracers. We update the catalogs of Galactic HII regions, GMCs, and 6.7-GHz
methanol masers, and then outline the spiral structure of the Milky Way. We
collected data for more than 2500 known HII regions, 1300 GMCs, and 900 6.7-GHz
methanol masers. If the photometric or trigonometric distance was not yet
available, we determined the kinematic distance using a Galaxy rotation curve
with the current IAU standard, $R_0$ = 8.5 kpc and $\Theta_0$ = 220 km
s$^{-1}$, and the most recent updated values of $R_0$ = 8.3 kpc and $\Theta_0$
= 239 km s$^{-1}$, after we modified the velocities of tracers with the adopted
solar motions. With the weight factors based on the excitation parameters of
HII regions or the masses of GMCs, we get the distributions of these spiral
tracers. The distribution of tracers shows at least four segments of arms in
the first Galactic quadrant, and three segments in the fourth quadrant. The
Perseus Arm and the Local Arm are also delineated by many bright HII regions.
The arm segments traced by massive star forming regions and GMCs are able to
match the HI arms in the outer Galaxy. We found that the models of three-arm
and four-arm logarithmic spirals are able to connect most spiral tracers. A
model of polynomial-logarithmic spirals is also proposed, which not only
delineates the tracer distribution, but also matches the observed tangential
directions.

independent estimates of the inclination angles of the stellar spin axis and of
the planetary orbital axis with respect to the line-of-sight, $i_\star$ and
$i_{\rm orb}$, and the projection of the spin--orbit angle onto the plane of
the sky, $\lambda$. These are mainly derived from asteroseismology, transit
lightcurve and the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect, respectively. The detailed joint

of the numerous parameters characterizing the planetary system, in addition to
$\psi$.
  We demonstrate the power of the joint analysis for the two specific systems,
HAT-P-7 and Kepler-25. HAT-P-7b is the first exoplanet suspected to be a
retrograde (or polar) planet because of the significant misalignment $\lambda
\approx 180^\circ$. Our joint analysis indicates $i_\star \approx {30D}$ and
$\psi \approx 120^\circ$, suggesting that the planetary orbit is closer to
polar rather than retrograde. Kepler-25 is one of the few multi-transiting
planetary systems with measured $\lambda$, and hosts two short-period
transiting planets and one outer non-transiting planet. The projected
spin--orbit angle of the larger transiting planet, Kepler-25c, has been
measured to be $\lambda \approx 0^\circ$, implying that the system is
well-aligned. With the help of the tight constraint from asteroseismology,
however, we obtain $i_\star={65.4}^{+{10.6}}_{-{6.4}}$ and
$\psi={26.9}^{+{7.0}}_{-{9.2}}$, and thus find that the system is actually

the Newman--Penrose and the perturbed Weyl scalars, $\psi_0$ and $\psi_4$ can
be obtained from the Teukolsky equation. In order to obtain the other Weyl
scalars and the perturbed metric, a formalism was proposed by Chrzanowski and
by Cohen and Kegeles (CCK) to construct these quantities in a radiation gauge
via the Hertz potential. As a simple example of the construction of the
perturbed gravitational field with this formalism, we consider the
gravitational field produced by a rotating circular ring around a Schwarzschild
black hole. In the CCK method, the metric is constructed in a radiation gauge
via the Hertz potential, which is obtained from the solution of the Teukolsky
equation. Since the solutions $\psi_0$ and $\psi_4$ of the Teukolsky equations
are spin-2 quantities, the Hertz potential is determined up to its monopole and
dipole modes. Without these lower modes, the constructed metric and
Newman--Penrose Weyl scalars have unphysical jumps on the spherical surface at
the radius of the ring. We find that the jumps of the imaginary parts of the
Weyl scalars are cancelled when we add the angular momentum perturbation to the
Hertz potential. Finally, by adding the mass perturbation and choosing the
parameters which are related to the gauge freedom, we obtain the perturbed
gravitational field which is smooth except on the equatorial plane outside the

  system of Chaplygin gases","36 pages",,,,"math.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  For one dimensional or multidimensional compressible Euler system of
polytropic gases, it is well known that the smooth solution will generally
develop singularities in finite time. However, for three dimensional Chaplygin
gases, due to the crucial role of ""null condition"" in the potential equation
which is derived by the irrotational and isentropic flow, P.Godin in [9] has
proved the global existence of a smooth 3-D spherically symmetric flow with
variable entropy when the initial data are of small smooth perturbations with
compact supports to a constant state. It is noted that there are some essential
differences on the global solution or blowup problems between 2-D and 3-D
hyperbolic systems. In this paper, we will focus on the global symmetric
solution problem of 2-D full compressible Euler system of Chaplygin gases.
Through carrying out involved analysis and finding an appropriate weight we can
derive some uniform weighted energy estimates on the small symmetric solution
to 2-D compressible Euler system of Chaplygin gases and further establish the
global existence of smooth solution by continuous induction method.

and cracks, are all pinned by substrate disorder. When driven, they move via
successive jumps called avalanches, with power law distributions of size,
duration and velocity. Their exponents, and the shape of an avalanche, defined
as its mean velocity as function of time, have recently been studied. They are
known approximatively from experiments and simulations, and were predicted from
mean-field models, such as the Brownian force model (BFM), where each point of
the elastic interface sees a force field which itself is a random walk. As we
showed in EPL 97 (2012) 46004, the BFM is the starting point for an $\epsilon =
d_{\rm c}-d$ expansion around the upper critical dimension, with $d_{\rm c}=4$
for short-ranged elasticity, and $d_{\rm c}=2$ for long-ranged elasticity. Here
we calculate analytically the ${\cal O}(\epsilon)$, i.e. 1-loop, correction to
the avalanche shape at fixed duration $T$, for both types of elasticity. The
exact expression is well approximated by $\left< \dot u(t=x T)\right>_T\simeq [
Tx(1-x)]^{\gamma-1} \exp\left( {\cal A}\left[\frac12-x\right]\right)$, $0<x<1$.
The asymmetry ${\cal A}\approx - 0.336 (1-d/d_{\rm c})$ is negative for $d$
close to $d_{\rm c}$, skewing the avalanche towards its end, as observed in
numerical simulations in $d=2$ and $3$. The exponent $\gamma=(d+\zeta)/z$ is
given by the two independent exponents at depinning, the roughness $\zeta$ and
the dynamical exponent $z$. We propose a general procedure to predict other
avalanche exponents in terms of $\zeta$ and $z$. We finally introduce and
calculate the shape at fixed avalanche size, not yet measured in experiments or
simulations.

metric of $({\cal M}^{2N+1})_{C}$ around the diagonal submanifold, where
$({\cal M}^N)_{C}$ is the Cartesian product of $N$ copies of ${\cal M}$ with a
cyclic ordering. This gives an infinite sequence of tubular metrics such that

the general tubular expansion theorem of [12] is crucially used. We discuss how
the complete reparametrization isometry of loop space arises in the large-$N$

computing the probability to reach a set of states within a given time

particular, we give a detailed derivation on how to use the method of path
integral together with nonequilibrium Green's function technique to obtain the
GF of FCS in electron transport systems based on the two-time quantum

Levitov-Lesovik's formula, is obtained. This formalism can be generalized to
account for spin transport for the system with noncollinear spin as well as
spin-orbit interaction. As an example, we have calculated the GF of
spin-polarized transferred charge, transferred spin, as well as the spin
transferred torque for a magnetic tunneling junction in the transient regime.
The GF is compactly expressed by a functional determinant represented by
Green's function and self-energy in the time domain. With this formalism, FCS
in spintronics in the transient regime can be studied. We also extend this
formalism to the quantum point contact system. For numerical results, we
calculate the GF and various cumulants of a double quantum dot system connected

Monte Carlo (KMC) method, and the well-known Bell-Evans-Polanyi (BEP)

non-diffusive flickering states -- an exact solution and a Tabu-like approach
that blocks already visited states. Comparing these various simulations allow
us to confirm that the BEP principle does not hold for complex system since
forward and reverse energy barriers are completely uncorrelated. This means
that following the lowest available energy barrier, even after removing the
flickering states, leads to rapid trapping: relaxing complex systems requires
crossing high-energy barriers in order to access new energy basins, in
agreement with the recently proposed replenish-and-relax model [B\'eland et
al., PRL 111, 105502 (2013)] This can be done by forcing the system through
these barriers with Tabu-like methods. Interestingly, we find that following
the fundamental kinetics of a system, though standard KMC approach, is at least
as efficient as these brute-force methods while providing the correct kinetics
information.

Similar to the measurement-device-independent quantum key distribution

perfectly characterize the encoded quantum states. However, our second protocol
does not require this assumption, which can defeat more known and unknown
source-side attacks compared with the MDI-QKD. The two protocols are naturally
immune to all hacking attacks with respect to detections. Therefore, the
security of the two protocols can be proven based on the violation of Bell's
inequality with measurement data under fair-sampling assumption. In our
simulation, the results of both protocols show that long-distance quantum key

sensational use of the telescope to unravel the secrets of the heavens, meaning
that he was predominantly seen as an astronomical innovator and advocate of the
Copernican world system. Danish astronomy at the time was however based on
Tycho Brahe's view of the universe and therefore hostile to Copernican and, by
implication, Galilean cosmology. Although Galileo's telescope attracted much
attention, it took about thirty years until a Danish astronomer actually used
the instrument for observations. By the 1640s Galileo was generally admired for
his astronomical discoveries, but no one in Denmark drew the consequence that
the dogma of the central Earth, a fundamental feature of the Tychonian world
picture, was therefore incorrect.

divergent nozzle. The flow is described by a 3-D steady potential equation,
which is multi-dimensional quasilinear hyperbolic (but degenerate at infinity)
with respect to the supersonic direction, and whose linearized part admits the
form $\p_t^2-\ds\f{1}{(1+t)^{2(\g-1)}}(\p_1^2+\p_2^2)+\ds\f{2(\g-1)}{1+t}\p_t$

property of the divergent nozzle and the mass conservation of gas, the moving
gas in the nozzle will gradually become rarefactive and tends to a vacuum state
at infinity, which implies that such a smooth supersonic flow should be
globally stable for small perturbations since there are no strong resulting

energy-momentum relation of the Special Theory of Relativity we present a novel
wave equation for ultrarelativistic matter. This wave equation arises when
particles satisfy the condition, $p>>m$, i.e, when the energy-momentum relation
can be approximated by, $E\simeq p+\frac{m^{2}}{2p}$. Interestingly enough,
such as the Dirac equation, it is found that this wave equation includes spin
in a natural way. Furthermore, the free solutions of this wave equation contain
plane waves that are completely equivalent to those of the theory of neutrino
oscillations. Therefore, the theory reproduces some standard results of the
Dirac theory in the limit $p>>m$, but offers the possibility of an explicit
Lorentz Invariance Violation of order, $\mathcal{O}((mc)^{4}/p^{2})$. As a
result, the theory could be useful to test small departures from Dirac equation
and Lorentz Invariance at very high energies. On the other hand, the wave
equation can also describe particles of spin 1 by a simple substitution of the
spin operators, $\boldsymbol{\sigma}\rightarrow\boldsymbol{\alpha}$. In
addition, it naturally admits a Lagrangian formulation and a Hamiltonian
formalism. We also discuss the associated conservation laws that arise through
the symmetry transformations of the Lagrangian.

major step forward in elucidating how the brain manages information.
Understanding the origin and functionality of critical-like dynamics, as well
as their robustness, is a major challenge in contemporary neuroscience. Here,
we present an extensive numerical study of a family of simple dynamic models,
which describe activity propagation in brain networks through the integration
of different neighboring spiking potentials, mimicking basic neural
interactions. The requirement of signal integration may lead to discontinuous
phase transitions in networks that are well described by the mean field
approximation, thus preventing the emergence of critical points in such
systems. Here we show that criticality in the brain is instead robust, as a
consequence of the hierarchical organization of the higher layers of cortical
networks, which signals a departure from the mean-field paradigm. We show that,
in finite-dimensional hierarchical networks, discontinuous phase transitions
exhibit a rounding phenomenon and turn continuous for values of the topological
dimension $D\le 2$, due to the presence of structural or topological disorder.
Our results may prove significant in explaining the observation of traits of
critical behavior in large-scale measurements of brain activity.

done by applying a projection operator that extracts the transverse part of
spatial vectors. In many circumstances the proper projection operator is
replaced by a simplified transverse one. It is widely held that such a
replacement does not affect the result in the radiation zone. In this paper the
action of the proper and simplified transverse projections will be compared by
making use of specific examples of a moving point charge. It will be
demonstrated that whenever the interminable spatial motion of the source is
unbounded with respect to the reference frame of the observer the replacement
of the proper projection operator by the simplified transverse one yields, even
in the radiation zone, an erroneous result with error which is of the same
order as the proper Coulomb gauge vector potential itself.

complex optimization problem into much simpler subproblems. The ADM algorithms
are typically short and easy to implement yet exhibit (nearly) state-of-the-art
performance for large-scale optimization problems.
  To apply ADM, we first formulate a given problem into the ""ADM-ready"" form,
so the final algorithm depends on the formulation. A problem like
$\mbox{minimize}_\mathbf{x} u(\mathbf{x}) + v(\mathbf{C}\mathbf{x})$ has six
different ""ADM-ready"" formulations. They can be in the primal or dual forms,
and they differ by how dummy variables are introduced. To each ""ADM-ready""
formulation, ADM can be applied in two different orders depending on how the
primal variables are updated. Finally, we get twelve different ADM algorithms!
How do they compare to each other? Which algorithm should one choose?
  In this paper, we show that many of the different ways of applying ADM are
equivalent. Specifically, we show that ADM applied to a primal formulation is
equivalent to ADM applied to its Lagrange dual; ADM is equivalent to a
primal-dual algorithm applied to the saddle-point formulation of the same
problem. These results are surprising since the primal and dual variables in
ADM are seemingly treated very differently, and some previous work exhibit
preferences in one over the other on specific problems. In addition, when one
of the two objective functions is quadratic, possibly subject to an affine
constraint, we show that swapping the update order of the two primal variables
in ADM gives the same algorithm. These results identify the few truly different
ADM algorithms for a problem, which generally have different forms of
subproblems from which it is easy to pick one with the most computationally
friendly subproblems.

transform domain is generated by a difference operator. In the present paper we
provide a bound on the number of Gaussian measurements required for successful
recovery for total variation and for the case that the analysis operator is a

the closure of $\Psi^*_p$, is completely characterized by Shannon-type
information inequalities if and only if $p$ is the $1$-partition or a

useful for solving some information theory and related problems where symmetry

down-conversion can be seen both as two copies of approximate EPR states, and
also as a kind of polarization supersinglet, we show a straightforward way to

molecular simulations. The rapid increase in computational power has made it
possible to probe increasingly complex systems, yet extracting accurate free
energies from these simulations remains a major challenge. Fully exploring the
free energy landscape of, say, a biological macromolecule typically requires
sampling large conformational changes and slow transitions. Often, the only
feasible way to study such a system is to simulate it using an enhanced
sampling method. The accelerated weight histogram (AWH) method is a new,
efficient extended ensemble sampling technique which adaptively biases the
simulation to promote exploration of the free energy landscape. The AWH method
uses a probability weight histogram which allows for efficient free energy
updates and results in an easy discretization procedure. A major advantage of
the method is its general formulation, making it a powerful platform for
developing further extensions and analyzing its relation to already existing
methods. Here, we demonstrate its efficiency and general applicability by
calculating the potential of mean force along a reaction coordinate for both a
single dimension and multiple dimensions. We make use of a non-uniform, free
energy dependent target distribution in reaction coordinate space so that
computational efforts are not wasted on physically irrelevant regions. We
present numerical results for molecular dynamics simulations of lithium acetate

important tool in quantum information science; however, the large number of

reconstruction procedures can become prohibitively time-consuming. Compressive
sensing, a procedure for solving inverse problems by incorporating prior
knowledge about the form of the solution, provides an attractive alternative to
the problem of high-dimensional quantum state characterisation. Using a
modified version of compressive sensing that incorporates the principles of
singular value thresholding, we reconstruct the density matrix of a
high-dimensional two-photon entangled system. The dimension of each photon is
equal to $d= 17$, corresponding to a system of 83521 unknown real parameters.
Accurate reconstruction is achieved with approximately 2500 measurements, only
3\% of the total number of unknown parameters in the state. The algorithm we
develop is fast, computationally inexpensive, and applicable to a wide range of
quantum states, thus demonstrating compressive sensing as an effective
technique for measuring the state of large-scale quantum systems.

enforce the program order between a pair of statements if needed. Due to the
intricate semantics of weak memory models, the placement of fences is
challenging even for experienced programmers. Too few fences lead to bugs

by time-domain THz and microwave spectroscopy, using also previously published
data and their new overall fits. Above the dielectric maximum temperature Tm ~
600 K, the response consists of coupled sub-THz oscillator and a relaxation
mode, assigned to strongly anharmonic Bi-ion vibrations and hopping, whose
slowing down explains the paraelectric-like permittivity increase to Tm. Below
Tm, the main relaxation continues slowing down and additional relaxation,
assigned to quasi-Debye losses, appears in the 10^11 Hz range. The oscillator
hardens on cooling and takes over the whole oscillator strength. The
permittivity decrease below Tm is caused by the reduced strength of the
relaxations due to dominance of the rhombohedral phase within the coexistence
region with the tetragonal phase. The anharmonic dynamics of Bi is supported by
previous structural studies. NBT represents a hybrid between standard and
relaxor ferroelectric behaviour.

that only molecular (or extraordinary) states appear near thresholds naturally,

KernelBoost classifier presented in [Becker et al., MICCAI 2013]. We start with
a scheme inspired by Auto-Context, but that is suitable in situations where the
lack of large training sets poses a potential problem of overfitting. The aim
is to capture the interactions between neighboring image pixels to better
regularize the boundaries of segmented regions. As in Auto-Context [Tu et al.,
PAMI 2009] the segmentation process is iterative and, at each iteration, the
segmentation results for the previous iterations are taken into account in
conjunction with the image itself. However, unlike in [Tu et al., PAMI 2009],
we organize our recursion so that the classifiers can progressively focus on
difficult-to-classify locations. This lets us exploit the power of the
decision-tree paradigm while avoiding over-fitting. In the context of this
architecture, KernelBoost represents a powerful building block due to its
ability to learn on the score maps coming from previous iterations. We first
introduce two important mechanisms to empower the KernelBoost classifier,
namely pooling and the clustering of positive samples based on the appearance
of the corresponding ground-truth. These operations significantly contribute to
increase the effectiveness of the system on biomedical images, where texture
plays a major role in the recognition of the different image components. We
then present some other techniques that can be easily integrated in the
KernelBoost framework to further improve the accuracy of the final
segmentation. We show extensive results on different medical image datasets,
including some multi-label tasks, on which our method is shown to outperform
state-of-the-art approaches. The resulting segmentations display high accuracy,
neat contours, and reduced noise.

show that it behaves as an artificial plate with an anisotropic effective Young

diagrams associated with bending waves propagating within an infinite array of
SRR, for which eigen-solutions are sought in the form of Floquet-Bloch waves.

Non-parametric image registration, in particular the technique of optimizing

provides flexible algorithms for image registration. Using a survey of
woodlands in southern Spain as an example, we show that non-parametric image
registration can be successful at fusing datasets when there is little prior
knowledge about how the datasets are interrelated (i.e. in the absence of
ground control points). The validity of non-parametric registration methods in
