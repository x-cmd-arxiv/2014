high energy scales, together with all other low- and high-energy constraints.
The constraints on the parameter space at low energy, including the measured
value of the Higgs mass and the signal strengths in channels are juxtaposed
with the conditions of vacuum stability, perturbativity and unitarity at
various scales. We find that a scenario with an exact $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry
in the potential cannot be valid beyond about 10 TeV without the intervention
of additional physics. On the other hand, when the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry is
broken, the theory can be valid even up to the Planck scale without any new
physics coming in. The interesting feature we point out is that such high-scale
validity is irrespective of the uncertainty in the top quark mass as well as
$\alpha_{s}(M_Z)$, in contrast with the standard model with a single Higgs
doublet. It is also shown that the presence of a CP-violating phase is allowed
when the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry is relaxed. The allowed regions in the
parameter space are presented for each case. The results are illustrated in the
context of a Type-II scenario.

It is a monotone under local operation + classical communications (LOCC) and
puts restrictions in LOCC convertibility of quantum states. Identifying the
Schmidt rank of an unknown quantum state therefore seek importance from
information theoretic perspective. In this work it is shown that a modified
version of Hardy's argument, which reveals the contradiction of quantum theory
with local realism, turns out to be useful for inspecting the minimal Schmidt
rank of the unknown state and hence also the minimal dimension of the system.
Use of Hardy's test in such task provides a practical advantage: the Schmidt
rank can be determined without knowing the detailed functioning of the
experimental devices i.e., Hardy's test suffices to be a device independent

topological systems out of equi- librium. More specifically, we consider
graphene with a sizable spin-orbit coupling, irradiated by circularly-
polarized light. In the absence of light, the spin-orbit coupling drives a
quantum spin Hall phase where edge currents with opposite spins
counter-propagate. On the other hand, the light generates a time-dependent
vector potential, which leads to a hopping parameter with staggered
time-dependent phases around the benzene ring. The model is a dynamical version
of the Haldane model, which considers a static staggered flux with zero total
flux through each plaquette. Since the light breaks time-reversal symmetry, a
quantum Hall phase protected by an integer topological invariant arises. By
numerically solving the complete problem, with spin-orbit coupling and light,
and investigating different values of the driving frequency {\omega}, we show
that the spectrum exhibits non-trivial gaps not only at zero energy, but also
at {\omega}/2. This additional gap is created by photon resonances between the
valence and conduction band of graphene, and the symmetry of the spectrum
forces it to lie at {\omega}/2. By increasing the intensity of the irradiation,
the topological state in the zero energy gap undergoes a dynamical phase
transition from a quantum spin Hall to a quantum Hall phase, whereas the gap
around {\omega}/2 remains in the quantum Hall regime.

reactions recently introduced by two of us [D. E. Manolopoulos and P. J. Hore,
J. Chem. Phys. 139, 124106 (2013)] can be generalised to allow for different
singlet and triplet recombination rates. This is a non-trivial generalisation
because when the recombination rates are different the recombination process is
dynamically coupled to the coherent electron spin dynamics of the radical pair.
Furthermore, because the recombination operator is a two-electron operator, it
is no longer sufficient simply to consider the two electrons as classical
vectors: one has to consider the complete set of 16 two-electron spin operators
as independent classical variables. The resulting semiclassical theory is first
validated by comparison with exact quantum mechanical results for a model
radical pair containing 12 nuclear spins. It is then used to shed light on the
spin dynamics of a carotenoid-porphyrin-fullerene (CPF) triad containing
considerably more nuclear spins which has recently been used to establish a
'proof of principle' for the operation of a chemical compass [K. Maeda et al.,
Nature 453, 387 (2008)]. We find in particular that the intriguing biphasic
behaviour that has been observed in the effect of an Earth-strength magnetic
field on the time-dependent survival probability of the photo-excited C+PF-
radical pair arises from a delicate balance between its asymmetric
recombination and the relaxation of the electron spin in the carotenoid

describe the mechanism of outliers generation in robust statistics. In a data
set with $n$ observations and $p$ variables, under the CCM, an outlier is a
unit, even if only one or few values are corrupted. Classical robust procedures
were designed to cope with this setting and the impact of observations were
limited whenever necessary. Recently, a different mechanism of outliers
generation, namely Independent Contamination Model (ICM), was introduced. In
this new setting each cell of the data matrix might be corrupted or not with a
probability independent on the status of the other cells. ICM poses new
challenge to robust statistics since the percentage of contaminated rows
dramatically increase with $p$, often reaching more than $50\%$. When this
situation appears, classical affine equivariant robust procedures do not work
since their breakdown point is $50\%$. For this contamination model we propose
a new type of robust methods namely composite robust procedures which are
inspired on the idea of composite likelihood, where low dimension likelihood,
very often the likelihood of pairs, are aggregate together in order to obtain
an approximation of the full likelihood which is more tractable. Our composite
robust procedures are build over pairs of observations in order to gain
robustness in the independent contamination model. We propose composite S and
$\tau$-estimators for linear mixed models. Composite $\tau$-estimators are
proved to have an high breakdown point both in the CCM and ICM. A Monte Carlo
study shows that our estimators compare favorably with respect to classical
S-estimators under the CCM and outperform them under the ICM. One example based
on a real data set illustrates the new robust procedure.

The moment of inertia and its dependence on the stellar mass and the

of long lasting quantum dynamics in the FMO complex point to protein dynamics
as a key factor in protecting and generating quantum coherence under laboratory

investigated extensively, the slow dynamics which effectively determine the
optical inhomogeneous broadening of experimental ensembles has received less
attention. Our study employs constrained geometric dynamics to study the
flexibility in the protein network by efficiently generating the accessible
conformational states from the published crystal structure. Statistical and
principle component analysis reveal highly correlated low frequency motions
between functionally relevant elements, including strong correlations between
pigments that are excitonically coupled. Our analysis reveals a hierarchy of
structural interactions which enforce these correlated motions, from the level
of monomer monomer interfaces right down to the alpha helices, beta sheets and
pigments. In addition to inducing strong spatial correlations across the
conformational ensemble, we find that the overall rigidity of the FMO complex

spacecraft rendezvous on UT 2010 November 4.58. This time period included the
passage at perihelion and the closest approach of the comet to the Earth. Here
we report detections of HCN, H2CO, CS, and OH and upper limits for HNC and DCN
towards 103P, using the Arizona Radio Observatory Kitt Peak 12m telescope (ARO
12m) and submillimeter telescope (SMT), the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope
(JCMT) and the Greenbank Telescope (GBT). The water production rate, QH2O =
(0.67 - 1.07) x 10^28 s^-1, was determined from the GBT OH data. From the
average abundance ratios of HCN and H2CO relative to water (0.13 +/- 0.03 % and
0.14 +/- 0.03 %, respectively), we conclude that H2CO is depleted and HCN is
normal with respect to typically-observed cometary mixing ratios. However, the
abundance ratio of HCN with water shows a large diversity with time. Using the
JCMT data we measured an upper limit for the DCN/HCN ratio <0.01. Consecutive
observations of ortho- H2CO and para-H2CO on November 2 (from data obtained at
the JCMT), allowed us to derive an ortho : para ratio (OPR) ~ 2.12 +/- 0.59
(1sigma), corresponding to Tspin > 8 K (2sigma).

galaxies by tracking correlations between the stellar population parameters,
age and metallicity, and the structural parameters that enter the Fundamental
Plane, radius and velocity dispersion sigma. These studies have found
intriguing correlations between these four parameters. In this work, we make
use of a semi-analytic model, based on halo merger trees extracted from the
Bolshoi cosmological simulation, that predicts the structural properties of
spheroid-dominated galaxies based on an analytic model that has been tested and
calibrated against an extensive suite of hydrodynamic+N-body binary merger
simulations. We predict the radius, sigma, luminosity, age, and metallicity of
spheroid-dominated galaxies, enabling us to compare directly to observations.
Our model predicts a strong correlation between age and sigma for early-type
galaxies, and no significant correlation between age and radius, in agreement
with observations. In addition we predict a strong correlation between
metallicity and sigma, and a weak correlation between metallicity and radius,
in qualitative agreement with observations. We find that the correlations with
sigma arise as a result of the strong link between sigma and the galaxy
assembly time. Minor mergers produce a large change in radius while leaving
sigma nearly the same, which explains the weaker trends with radius.

the nuclear-electronic orbital method at Hartree-Fock level (NEO-HF) is used as
a non-Born-Oppenheimer (nBO) ab initio computational procedure assuming both
electrons and protons as quantum waves while carbon nuclei as point charges in
these systems. The ab initio calculations proceed substituting all the protons
of each species first with deuterons and then tritons. At the next step, the

The results of topological analysis and integration of atomic properties
demonstrate that the MC-QTAIM is capable of deciphering the underlying AIM
structure of all the considered species. Also, the results of the analysis for
each isotopic composition are distinct and the fingerprint of the mass
difference of hydrogen isotopes is clearly seen in both topological and AIM
analyses. This isotopic distinction is quite unique in the MC-QTAIM and not
recovered by the orthodox QTAIM that treats nuclei as clamped particles. The
results of the analysis also demonstrate that each quantum nucleus that forms
an atomic basin resides within its own basin. The confinement of quantum nuclei
within a single basin is used to simplify the basic equations of the MC-QTAIM
paving the way for future theoretical studies.

of the finite density thermodynamics of hot and dense quark-gluon plasma. As we
are interested in a temperature regime, in which naive perturbation theory is
known to lose its predictive power, we clearly need to use a refined approach.
To this end, we adopt a resummed perturbation theory point of view and employ
two different frameworks. We first use hard-thermal-loop perturbation theory
(HLTpt) at leading order to obtain the pressure for nonvanishing quark chemical
potentials, and next, inspired by dimensional reduction, resum the known
four-loop weak coupling expansion for the quantity.
  We present and analyze our findings for various cumulants of conserved
charges. This provides us with information, through correlations and
fluctuations, on the degrees of freedom effectively present in the quark-gluon
plasma right above the deconfinement transition. Moreover, we compare our
results with state-of-the-art lattice Monte Carlo simulations as well as with a
recent three-loop mass truncated HTLpt calculation. We obtain very good
agreement between the two different perturbative schemes, as well as between
them and lattice data, down to surprisingly low temperatures right above the
phase transition. We also quantitatively test the convergence of an
approximation, which is used in higher order loop calculations in HTLpt. This
method based on expansions in mass parameters, is unavoidable beyond leading
order, thus motivating our investigation. We find the ensuing convergence to be
very fast, validating its use in higher order computations.

of the present development is the filter-update scheme, derived from an
ensemble approximation of the time-discretized nonlinear filtering equation,
modified to account for Poisson-type measurements. Specifically, the additive
update through a gain-like correction term, empirically approximated from the
innovation integral in the filtering equation, eliminates the problem of
particle collapse encountered in many conventional particle filters. Through a
few numerical demonstrations, the versatility of the proposed filter is brought
forth, first with application to filtering problems with diffusive or

extremization of the associated cost functional is achieved simply by an
appropriate redefinition of the innovation process.

forward-moving with respect to the flow. While simulations incorporating
transverse shocks provide good fits for 0420-014 and 1156+295, oblique shocks
are required for modeling the OJ~287 outburst, and an unusually-low value of

granulation using a two-component approximation to the mass continuity
equation. The model takes four times the density scale height as the integral
(driving) scale of the vertical motions at each depth. Scales larger than this
decay with height from the deeper layers. Those smaller are assumed to follow a
Kolomogorov turbulent cascade, with the total power in the vertical convective
motions matching that required to transport the solar luminosity in a mixing
length formulation. These model components are validated using large scale
radiative hydrodynamic simulations. We reach two primary conclusions: 1. The
model predicts significantly more power at low wavenumbers than is observed in
the solar photospheric horizontal velocity spectrum. 2. Ionization plays a
minor role in shaping the observed solar velocity spectrum by reducing
convective amplitudes in the regions of partial helium ionization. The excess
low wavenumber power is also seen in the fully nonlinear three-dimensional
radiative hydrodynamic simulations employing a realistic equation of state.
This adds to other recent evidence suggesting that the amplitudes of large
scale convective motions in the Sun are significantly lower than expected.
Employing the same feature tracking algorithm used with observational data on
the simulation output, we show that the observed low wavenumber power can be
reproduced in hydrodynamic models if the amplitudes of large scale modes in the
deep layers are artificially reduced. Since the large scale modes have reduced
amplitudes, modes on the scale of supergranulation and smaller remain important
to convective heat flux even in the deep layers, suggesting that small scale
convective correlations are maintained through the bulk of the solar convection
zone.

C-bearing molecules in cold starless cores rapidly decrease with increasing
density, as the molecules form mantles on dust grains. We study CO depletion in
102 massive clumps selected from the ATLASGAL 870 micron survey, and
investigate its correlation with evolutionary stage and with the physical
parameters of the sources. Moreover, we study the gradients in [12C]/[13C] and
[18O]/[17O] isotopic ratios across the inner Galaxy, and the virial stability
of the clumps. We use low-J emission lines of CO isotopologues and the dust
continuum emission to infer the depletion factor fD. RATRAN one-dimensional
models were also used to determine fD and to investigate the presence of
depletion above a density threshold. The isotopic ratios and optical depth were
derived with a Bayesian approach. We find a significant number of clumps with a
large fD, up to ~20. Larger values are found for colder clumps, thus for
earlier evolutionary phases. For massive clumps in the earliest stages of
evolution we estimate the radius of the region where CO depletion is important
to be a few tenths of a pc. Clumps are found with total masses derived from
dust continuum emission up to ~20 times higher than the virial mass, especially
among the less evolved sources. These large values may in part be explained by
the presence of depletion: if the CO emission comes mainly from the low-density
outer layers, the molecules may be subthermally excited, leading to an
overestimate of the dust masses. CO depletion in high-mass clumps seems to
behave as in the low-mass regime, with less evolved clumps showing larger
values for the depletion than their more evolved counterparts, and increasing
for denser sources. The C and O isotopic ratios are consistent with previous
determinations, and show a large intrinsic scatter.

arises from the interference between $B_s^0$-$\bar{B}_s^0$ mixing and the
loop-induced decay amplitude. Using a sample of proton-proton collision data
corresponding to an integrated luminosity of $3.0\, fb^{-1}$ collected with the

is obtained. The CP-violating phase is measured to be ${\phi_s

peculiar feature of quantum mechanics and responsible for many key phenomena in
the theory, such as complementarity or uncertainty relations. For the special
case of projective measurements quantum behavior can be characterized by the
commutator but for generalized measurements it is not easy to decide whether
two measurements can still be understood in classical terms or whether they
show already quantum features. We prove that generalized measurements which do
not fulfill the notion of joint measurability are nonclassical, as they can be
used for the task of quantum steering. This shows that the notion of joint
measurability is, among several definitions, the proper one to characterize
quantum behavior. Moreover, the equivalence allows to derive novel steering
inequalities from known results on joint measurability and new criteria for
joint measurability from known results on the steerability of states.

uses a Gaussian process (GP) to share parameters of the sparsity-inducing prior
in proportion to feature similarity as defined by an arbitrary positive
definite kernel. For linear regression, this sparsity-inducing prior on
regression coefficients is a relaxation of the canonical spike-and-slab prior
that flattens the mixture model into a scale mixture of normals. This prior
retains the explicit posterior probability on inclusion parameters---now with
GP probit prior distributions---but enables tractable computation via
elliptical slice sampling for the latent Gaussian field. We motivate
development of this prior using the genomic application of association mapping,
or identifying genetic variants associated with a continuous trait. Our
Bayesian structured sparsity model produced sparse results with substantially
improved sensitivity and precision relative to comparable methods. Through
simulations, we show that three properties are key to this improvement: i)
modeling structure in the covariates, ii) significance testing using the
posterior probabilities of inclusion, and iii) model averaging. We present

the clinical utility of each marker using an independent test set. The results
suggest that EHR data can be easily used to detect markers of clinically acute

6-$\sigma$ evidence that the total mass-density profile of early-type galaxies
varies systematically in the sense of being shallower at higher lens-galaxy
velocity dispersions. The trend is only significant when single-image systems
are considered, highlighting the importance of including both ""lenses"" and
""non-lenses"" for an unbiased treatment of the lens population when extending to
lower mass ranges. By scaling simple stellar population models to the HST
I-band data, we identify a strong trend of increasing dark-matter fraction at
higher velocity dispersions, which can be alternatively interpreted as a trend
in the stellar initial mass function (IMF) normalization. Consistent with
previous findings and the suggestion of a non-universal IMF, we find that a
Salpeter IMF is ruled out for galaxies with velocity dispersion less than $180$
km/s. Considered together, our mass-profile and dark-matter-fraction trends
with increasing galaxy mass could both be explained by an increasing relative
contribution on kiloparsec scales from a dark-matter halo with a spatial
profile more extended than that of the stellar component.

Kepler data for a correlation between the peak offset direction and the
planet's temperature. Such a correlation could arise if thermal emission
dominates light from hotter planets that harbor hot spots shifted toward the
evening-side, as theoretically predicted, while reflected light dominates
cooler planets with clouds on the planet's morning-side.

thresholds and corresponding confidence levels (CLs) in high contrast imaging
at small angles. When looking close to the star, the number of resolution
elements decreases rapidly towards small angles. This reduction of the number
of degrees of freedom dramatically affects CLs and false alarm probabilities.
Naively using the same ideal hypothesis and methods as for larger separations,
which are well understood and commonly assume Gaussian noise, can yield up to
one order of magnitude error in contrast estimations at fixed CL. The
statistical penalty exponentially increases towards very small inner working
angles. Even at 5-10 resolution elements from the star, false alarm
probabilities can be significantly higher than expected. Here we present a
rigorous statistical analysis which ensures robustness of the CL, but also
imposes a substantial limitation on corresponding achievable detection limits
(thus contrast) at small angles. This unavoidable fundamental statistical
effect has a significant impact on current coronagraphic and future high
contrast imagers. Finally, the paper concludes with practical recommendations
to account for small number statistics when computing the sensitivity to
companions at small angles and when exploiting the results of direct imaging
planet surveys.

must either be very heavy or the mixing in the stop sector must be very large.
Lower stop masses, possibly more accessible at the LHC, still give the correct
Higgs mass only if the trilinear stop mixing parameter $|A_t|$ is in the
multi-TeV range. Recently it has been shown that such large stop mixing leads
to an unstable electroweak vacuum which spontaneously breaks charge or colour.
In this work we therefore go beyond the CMSSM and investigate the effects of
including baryon number violating operators $\lambda'' \bar{\bf U} \bar{\bf

\simeq {\mathcal{O}}(0.3)$ light stop masses as low as 220 GeV are consistent
with the observed Higgs mass as well as flavour constraints while allowing for
a stable vacuum. The light stop in this scenario is often the lightest
supersymmetric particle. We furthermore discuss the importance of the one-loop
corrections involving R-parity violating couplings for a valid prediction of
the light stop masses.

are in orbits misaligned with respect to the spin axis of the host star, and an
outer planet. Various mechanisms have been proposed to explain the broad
distribution of spin-orbit angles among exoplanets, and these theories fall
under two broad categories. The first is based on dynamical interactions in a
multi-body system, while the other assumes that disk migration is the driving
mechanism in planetary configuration and that the star (or disk) is titled with
respect to the planetary plane. Here we show that the large observed obliquity
of Kepler-56 system is consistent with a dynamical origin. In addition, we use
observations by Huber et al. (2013) to derive the obliquity's probability
distribution function, thus improving the constrained lower limit. The outer
planet may be the cause of the inner planets' large obliquities, and we give
the probability distribution function of its inclination, which depends on the
initial orbital configuration of the planetary system. We show that even in the
presence of precise measurement of the true obliquity, one cannot distinguish
the initial configurations. Finally we consider the fate of the system as the
star continues to evolve beyond the main sequence, and we find that the
obliquity of the system will not undergo major variations as the star climbs
the red giant branch. We follow the evolution of the system and find that the
innermost planet will be engulfed in ~129 Myr. Furthermore we put an upper
limit of ~155 Myr for the engulfment of the second planet. This corresponds to

with a complex network of nineteen massive superclusters of young stars (or
small tidal dwarf galaxies) separated by ~1 kpc in projection from one another,
combining to an estimated total star formation rate of ~5 solar masses per

the two merging galaxies. This morphology is strongly reminiscent of the
well-known ""beads on a string"" mode of star formation observed on kpc-scales in
the arms of spiral galaxies, resonance rings, and in tidal tails between
interacting galaxies. Nevertheless, the arrangement of this star formation
relative to the nuclei of the two galaxies is difficult to interpret in a

annihilation has been detected from the Galaxy since the 70s. Spatially
resolved observations using the INTEGRAL satellite have shown its full sky
distribution to be strongly concentrated in the Galactic bulge, with a smaller
contribution from the disk, unlike the situation in any other wavelength. The
puzzling distribution of the positrons gave rise to various suggestions,
including stellar nucleosynthesis in core-collapse (CC) and type Ia
thermonuclear supernovae (SNe), accreting compact objects, and more ""exotic""
explanations of annihilation of dark-matter particles. However, such models
encounter difficulties in reproducing the total Galactic 511 keV flux as well
as its peculiar bulge-centered distribution. Theoretical models of SNe from
thermonuclear Helium detonations on white dwarfs (WDs) were suggested as
potential additional sources of positrons, contributing to the Galactic
Gamma-ray emission. Here, we show that the recently discovered class of faint,
calcium-rich type Ib SNe (with the prototype SN 2005E), thought to arise from
such explosions, also called "".Ia"" SNe, can explain both the 511 keV flux and
its distribution, and can eliminate the need for non-astrophysical (e.g., dark
matter annihilation) sources. Such SNe comprise a fraction of only ~2% of all
SNe, but they currently inject hundreds of times more positrons (from $^{44}$Ti
decay) to the ISM than injected by CC SNe, enough to reproduce the total
Galactic 511 keV line emission. They exclusively explode in old environments,
and their contribution to the 511 keV emission therefore follows the old (>10
Gyrs) Galactic stellar population, dominated by the bulge, thereby reproducing
the observed large bulge-to-disk ratio.

cluster-dispersion normalized BCG peculiar velocity |Delta V_1|/sigma_c follows
an exponential distribution with scale length 0.39+/-0.03. Both L_m and alpha
increase with sigma_c. The alpha parameter is further moderated by both the
spatial and velocity offset from the cluster center, with larger alpha
correlated with the proximity of the BCG to the cluster mean velocity or
potential center. At the same time, position in the cluster has little effect
on L_m. The luminosity difference between the BCG and second-ranked galaxy, M2,
increases as the peculiar velocity of the BCG within the cluster decreases.
Further, when M2 is a close luminosity ""rival"" of the BCG, the galaxy that is
closest to either the velocity or X-ray center of the cluster is most likely to
have the larger alpha. We conclude that the inner portions of the BCGs are
formed outside the cluster, but interactions in the heart of the galaxy cluster
grow and extend the envelopes of the BCGs.

around shocks with different strengths, finding that the mean free path for
pitch-angle scattering of energetic ions is comparable with their gyroradii
calculated in the self-generated turbulence. For moderately-strong shocks,
magnetic field amplification proceeds in the quasi-linear regime, and particles
diffuse according to the self-generated diffusion coefficient, i.e., the
scattering rate depends only on the amount of energy in modes with wavelengths
comparable with the particle gyroradius. For very strong shocks, instead, the
magnetic field is amplified up to non-linear levels, with most of the energy in
modes with wavelengths comparable to the gyroradii of highest-energy ions, and
energetic particles experience Bohm-like diffusion in the amplified field. We
also show how enhanced diffusion facilitates the return of energetic particles
to the shock, thereby determining the maximum energy that can be achieved in a
given time via diffusive shock acceleration. The parametrization of the

of like chirality and current direction are considered as a model for split

constructed analytically through an extension of the methods developed in Titov
& D\'emoulin (1999) and numerically through an evolutionary sequence including
shear flows, flux emergence, and flux cancellation in the photospheric
boundary. It is demonstrated that the analytical equilibria are stable if an
external toroidal (shear) field component exceeding a threshold value is
included. If this component decreases sufficiently, then both flux ropes turn
unstable for conditions typical of solar active regions, with the lower rope
typically being unstable first. Either both flux ropes erupt upward, or only
the upper rope erupts while the lower rope reconnects with the ambient flux low
in the corona and is destroyed. However, for shear field strengths staying
somewhat above the threshold value, the configuration also admits evolutions
which lead to partial eruptions with only the upper flux rope becoming unstable
and the lower one remaining in place. This can be triggered by a transfer of
flux and current from the lower to the upper rope, as suggested by the
observations of a split filament in Paper~I (Liu et al. 2012). It can also
result from tether-cutting reconnection with the ambient flux at the X-type
structure between the flux ropes, which similarly influences their stability
properties in opposite ways. This is demonstrated for the numerically

inherited by the majority of cosmic signals coming from redshifts above z ~ 10,

galaxies. At higher redshifts, the supersonic velocities have thus strong
impact affecting the abundance of first star forming halos in an inhomogeneous

Mayer-Vietoris blowup complex, a topological space, which organizes the various
subspaces needed for employing the Mayer-Vietoris principle. Next, we compute
the homology of each subspace in the blowup complex in parallel and then glue
these results together in serial. We show how to use the persistence algorithm
to organize these computations. In the first stage, any algorithm can be used
to produce a cover of the input complex. We describe an algorithm for producing
a cover of a space with a simple structure and bounded overlap based on graph
partitions. Additionally, we present a simplistic model for the problem of
finding covers appropriate for parallel algorithms and show that finding such
covers is NP-Hard. Finally, we present a second parallel homology algorithm.
This algorithm avoids the explicit construction of the blowup complex saving

procedure, and provide additional results. Our analysis allows us create a
taxonomy of the chase variations and the properties they satisfy. Two of the
most central problems regarding the chase is termination, and discovery of
restricted classes of sets of dependencies that guarantee termination of the
chase. The search for the restricted classes has been motivated by a fairly
recent result that shows that it is undecidable to determine whether the chase
with a given dependency set will terminate on a given instance. There is a
small dissonance here, since the quest has been for classes of sets of
dependencies guaranteeing termination of the chase on all instances, even
though the latter problem was not known to be undecidable. We resolve the
dissonance in this paper by showing that determining whether the chase with a
given set of dependencies terminates on all instances is coRE-complete. For the
hardness proof we use a reduction from word rewriting systems, thereby also
showing the close connection between the chase and word rewriting. The same
reduction also gives us the aforementioned instance-dependent RE-completeness
result as a byproduct. For one of the restricted classes guaranteeing
termination on all instances, the stratified sets dependencies, we provide new
complexity results for the problem of testing whether a given set of
dependencies belongs to it. These results rectify some previous claims that
have occurred in the literature.

included spectra with both high S/N and that did not show strong TiO absorption
bands. The present work extends previous analyses of this data set beyond Fe
and the alpha-elements Mg, Si, Ca, and Ti. While we find reasonable agreement
with past work, the data presented here indicate that the bulge may exhibit a
different chemical composition than the local thick disk, especially at
[Fe/H]>-0.5. In particular, the bulge [alpha/Fe] ratios may remain enhanced to
a slightly higher [Fe/H] than the thick disk and the Fe-peak elements Co, Ni,
and Cu appear enhanced compared to the disk. There is also some evidence that
the [Na/Fe] (but not [Al/Fe]) trends between the bulge and local disk may be
different at low and high metallicity. We also find that the velocity
dispersion decreases as a function of increasing [Fe/H] for both fields, and do
not detect any significant cold, high velocity population. A comparison with
chemical enrichment models indicates that a significant fraction of hypernovae
are required to explain the bulge abundance trends, and that initial mass
functions that are steep, top-heavy (and do not include strong outflow), or
truncated to avoid including contributions from stars >40 solar masses are
ruled out, in particular because of disagreement with the Fe-peak abundance
data. [abridged]

When one dimension is non-compact, a variety of field theories produce long

phenomenon associated with the Hagedorn density of states. With the help of
numerical and mathematical results, we show that problems arise when two or

achieved in bilayer and trilayer systems, highlighting the importance of

hybridization vanishes along the nodal directions by way of a specific pattern
of orbital overlap. Recent quantum oscillation measurements in bilayer cuprates
have provided evidence for a residual bilayer-splitting at the nodes that is
sufficiently small to enable magnetic breakdown tunneling at the nodes. Here we
show that several key features of the experimental data can be understood in
terms weak spin-orbit interactions naturally present in bilayer systems, whose
primary effect is to cause the magnetic breakdown to be accompanied by a spin
flip. These features can now be understood include the equidistant set of three
quantum oscillation frequencies, the asymmetry of the quantum oscillation
amplitudes in c-axis transport compared to ab-plane transport, and the
anomalous magnetic field angle dependence of the amplitude of side frequencies
suggestive of small effective g-factors. We suggest that spin-orbit
interactions in bilayer systems can further affect the structure of the nodal
quasiparticle spectrum in the superconducting phase.

determines the commensurability class of the 2-manifold (resp., 3-manifold). We
establish effective versions of these rigidity results by ensuring that, for

explicitly bounded as a function of volume. We also prove an effective version
of a similar rigidity result established by the second author with Reid on a
surface analog of the length spectrum for hyperbolic 3-manifolds. These
effective results have corresponding algebraic analogs involving maximal
subfields and quaternion subalgebras of quaternion algebras. To prove these

interaction of subsurface layers with the photosphere and chromosphere.
According to realistic 3D radiative MHD numerical simulations ubiquitous
small-scale vortex tubes are generated by turbulent flows below the visible
surface and concentrated in the intergranular lanes. The vortex tubes can
capture and amplify magnetic field, penetrate into chromospheric layers and
initiate quasi-periodic flow eruptions that generates Alfv\'enic waves,
transport mass and energy into the solar atmosphere. The simulations revealed
high-speed flow patterns, and complicated thermodynamic and magnetic structures
in the erupting vortex tubes. The spontaneous eruptions are initiated and
driven by strong pressure gradients in the near-surface layers, and accelerated
by the Lorentz force in the low chromosphere. In this paper, the simulation
data are used to further investigate the dynamics of the eruptions, their
spectro-polarimetric characteristics for the Fe I 6301.5 and 6302.5 A spectral
lines, and demonstrate expected signatures of the eruptions in the Hinode SP
data. We found that the complex dynamical structure of vortex tubes (downflows
in the vortex core and upflows on periphery) can be captured by the Stokes I
profiles. During an eruption, the ratio of down and upflows can suddenly
change, and this effect can be observed in the Stokes V profile. Also, during
the eruption the linear polarization signal increases, and this also can be
detected with Hinode SP.

[6, 9], quasiprojective algebraic varieties with accessible affine open covers
were introduced, for use in classifying the uniserial representations of
$\Lambda$ having sequence ${\Bbb S}$ of consecutive composition factors. Our
principal objectives here are threefold: One is to prove these varieties to be
`good approximations' -- in a sense to be made precise -- to geometric
quotients of the classical varieties $\operatorname{Mod-Uni}({\Bbb S})$
parametrizing the pertinent uniserial representations, modulo the usual
conjugation action of the general linear group. To some extent, this fills the
information gap left open by the frequent non-existence of such quotients. A
second goal is that of facilitating the transfer of information among the
`host' varieties into which the considered uniserial varieties can be embedded.
These tools are then applied towards the third objective, concerning the
existence of geometric quotients: We prove that $\operatorname{Mod-Uni}({\Bbb
S})$ has a geometric quotient by the $GL$-action precisely when the uniserial
variety has a geometric quotient modulo a certain natural algebraic group
action, in which case the two quotients coincide. Our main results are
exploited in a representation-theoretic context: Among other consequences, they
yield a geometric characterization of the algebras of finite uniserial type
which supplements existing descriptions, but is cleaner and more readily
checkable.

minimization algorithm, which compares an individual lenslet's arc lamp
spectrum to a simulated arc lamp spectrum. This method enables measurement of
spectral positions to better than 1/10th of a pixel on the GPI IFS detector
using Gemini's facility calibration lamp unit GCAL, improving spectral
extraction accuracy compared to earlier approaches. Using such wavelength
calibrations we have measured how internal flexure of the spectrograph with
changing zenith angle shifts spectra on the detector. We describe the methods
used to compensate for these shifts when assembling datacubes from on-sky

necessary to quantify and mitigate wavefront error (WFE). A large source of
potential static WFE arises from the primary AO wavefront sensor (WFS)
detector's use of multiple readout segments with independent signal chains
including on-chip preamplifiers and external amplifiers. Temperature changes
within GPI's electronics cause drifts in readout segments' bias levels,
inducing an RMS WFE of 1.1 nm and 41.9 nm over 4.44 degrees Celsius, for
magnitude 4 and 11 stars, respectively. With a goal of $<$2 nm of static WFE,
these are significant enough to require remedial action. Simulations imply a
requirement to take fresh WFS darks every 2 degrees Celsius of temperature
change, for a magnitude 6 star; similarly, for a magnitude 7 star, every 1
degree Celsius of temperature change. For sufficiently dim stars, bias drifts
exceed the signal, causing a large initial WFE, and the former periodic
requirement practically becomes an instantaneous/continuous one, making the
goal of $<$2 nm of static WFE very difficult for stars of magnitude 9 or
fainter. In extreme cases, this can cause the AO loops to destabilize due to
perceived nonphysical wavefronts, as some of the WFS's Shack-Hartmann quadcells
are split between multiple readout segments. Presented here is GPI's AO WFS
geometry, along with detailed steps in the simulation used to quantify bias
drift related WFE, followed by laboratory and on sky results, and concluded

stronger for galaxies brighter in rest-frame optical and the trend is
particularly strong for PE galaxies, indicating that passive galaxies with
larger stellar masses reside in more massive halos. In contrast, at rest-frame
UV we find that while the clustering of SF galaxies increases with increasing
luminosity, it decreases for PE galaxies; a possible explanation lies in
quenching of star formation in the most massive halos. Furthermore, we find two
components in the correlation functions for both SF and PE galaxies,
attributable to one- and two-halo terms. The presence of one-halo terms for
both PE and SF galaxies suggests that environmental effects were producing
passive galaxies in virtualized environments already by z~2. Finally, we find
notable clustering differences between the four widely-separated fields in our

cannot be explained classically can be verified experimentally, and has
numerous applications in modern quantum information. Today, the CHSH inequality
is probably the most well-known Bell inequality and it has given us a wealth of
understanding in what differentiates the classical from the quantum world. Yet,
there are certainly other means of quantifying ""Bell non-locality without
inequalities"" such as the famous Hardy's paradox. As such, one may wonder
whether these are entirely different approaches to non-locality. For this

flexibility, and sustainability to support data traffic in the mobile Internet
era. To tackle these challenges, cloud-based cellular architectures have been
proposed where virtual base stations (VBSs) play a key role. VBSs bring further
energy savings but also demands a new energy consumption model as well as the
optimization of computational resources. This paper studies the energy-delay
tradeoffs of VBSs with delay tolerant traffic. We propose a
computational-resource-aware energy consumption model to capture the total
energy consumption of a VBS and reflect the dynamic allocation of computational
resources including the number of CPU cores and the CPU speed. Based on the
model, we analyze the energy-delay tradeoffs of a VBS considering BS sleeping
and state switching cost to minimize the weighted sum of power consumption and
average delay. We derive the explicit form of the optimal data transmission
rate and find the condition under which the energy optimal rate exists and is
unique. Opportunities to reduce the average delay and achieve energy savings
simultaneously are observed. We further propose an efficient algorithm to
jointly optimize the data rate and the number of CPU cores. Numerical results
validate our theoretical analyses and under a typical simulation setting we
find more than 60% energy savings can be achieved by VBSs compared with
conventional base stations under the EARTH model, which demonstrates the great
potential of VBSs in 5G cellular systems.

interferometry from CHARA, and high-resolution spectroscopy. Asteroseismic
oscillations detected in the Kepler short-cadence photometry combined with an
effective temperature calculated from the interferometric angular diameter and
bolometric flux yield a mean density, rho_star = 0.0130 +- 0.0003 rho_sun and
surface gravity, logg = 3.280 +- 0.011. Combining the gravity and density we
find Rstar = 5.35 +- 0.20 Rsun and Mstar = 1.99 +- 0.23 Msun. The trigonometric
parallax and CHARA angular diameter give a radius Rstar = 4.97 +- 0.07 Rsun.
This smaller radius,when combined with the mean stellar density, corresponds to
a stellar mass Mstar = 1.60 +- 0.08 Msun, which is smaller than the
asteroseismic mass by 1.6-sigma. We find that a larger mass is supported by the
observation of mixed modes in our high-precision photometry, the spacing of
which is consistent only for Mstar =~ 1.8 Msun. Our various and independent
mass measurements can be compared to the mass measured from interpolating the
spectroscopic parameters onto stellar evolution models, which yields a
model-based mass M_star = 1.87 +- 0.07 Msun. This mass agrees well with the
asteroseismic value,but is 2.6-sigma higher than the mass from the combination
of asteroseismology and interferometry. The discrepancy motivates future

of anti-symmetric residual aberrations in high-resolution transmission electron
microscopy (HRTEM) images of weakly scattering 2D-objects. The method is based
on applying the same aberrations with the opposite phase to the Fourier
transform of the recorded image intensity and subsequently inverting the
Fourier transform. We present the theoretical justification of the method and
its verification based on simulated images in the case of low-order
anti-symmetric aberrations. Ultimately the method is applied to experimental
hardware aberration-corrected HRTEM images of single-layer graphene and MoSe2
resulting in images with strongly reduced residual low-order aberrations, and
consequently improved interpretability. Alternatively, this method can be used
to estimate by trial and error the residual anti-symmetric aberrations in HRTEM
images of weakly scattering objects.

the performance limits of SNWTs, simulation is becoming increasingly important.
The objectives of this work are: 1) to theoretically explore the essential
physics of SNWTs (e.g., electrostatics, transport and band structure) by
performing computer-based simulations, and 2) to assess the performance limits
and scaling potentials of SNWTs and to address the SNWT design issues. The
computer based simulations carried out are essentially based on DFT using NEGF
formalism. A silicon nanowire has been modeled as PN diode (Zener Diode), PIN
diode, PIP & NIN diode configurations by selectively doping the nanowire and
simulated by biasing one end of the nanowire to ground and sweeping the other
end of the nanowire from -1 V to 1 V to obtain the electrical characteristics
of the respective diodes. In order to determine the effectiveness of the
modeled diodes in silicon nanowire, the same diodes have been modeled using a
germanium nanowire by selective doping and simulated in the same manner to
obtain the electrical characteristics of the germanium nanowire based diodes
which has been used as a reference to analyze the characteristics obtained
using silicon nanowire. The modeled diodes are extremely small in dimension
when compared to the conventional bulk silicon and germanium based diodes. This
work is followed by modeling and simulation of a gate all around nanowire field
effect transistor using two different gate dielectrics, followed by temperature
dependence of the nanowire FET characteristics and the off state current and
conductance variation using the two dielectrics.

type in the category of modules over a ring. It begins with basic definitions,
a brief history, and a discussion of global decomposition problems going back
to work of K\""othe and Cohen-Kaplansky; these are strongly tied to algebraic
compactness. Characterisations of ($\Sigma$-)algebraically compact modules are
presented, as well as the functorial underpinnings on which they are based. In
particular, product-compatible functors, matrix functors and $p$-functors are
discussed. The latter part of the article is devoted to rings of vanishing left
pure global dimension, product completeness, endofiniteness, the pure
semisimplicity problem and its connection with a strong Artin problem on
division ring extensions.

--- KOI-13, HAT-P-7, TrES-2, and Kepler-76, which show BEaming, Ellipsoidal and
Reflection (BEER) phase modulations. The mass of the four planets can be
estimated from either the beaming or the ellipsoidal amplitude, given the mass
and radius of their parent stars. For KOI-13, HAT-P-7, and Kepler-76 we find
that the beaming-based planetary mass estimate is larger than the mass
estimated from the ellipsoidal amplitude, consistent with previous studies.
This apparent discrepancy may be explained by equatorial superrotation of the
planet atmosphere, which induces an angle shift of the planet
reflection/emission phase modulation, as was suggested for Kepler-76 in the
first paper of this series. We propose a modified BEER model that supports
superrotation, assuming either a Lambertian or geometric reflection/emission
phase function, and provides a photometry-consistent estimate of the planetary
mass. Our analysis shows that for Kepler-76 and HAT-P-7, the Lambertian
superrotation BEER model is highly preferable over an unshifted null model,
while for KOI-13 it is preferable only at a 1.4 sigma level. For TrES-2 we do
not find such preference. For all four systems the Lambertian superrotation
model mass estimates are in excellent agreement with the planetary masses
derived from, or constrained by, radial velocity measurements. This makes the
Lambertian superrotation BEER model a viable tool for estimating the masses of
hot Jupiters from photometry alone. We conclude that hot Jupiter superrotation
may be a common phenomenon that can be detected in the visual light curves of
Kepler.

$S$-structure of $\bigoplus_{i \in I} M_i$, is required to force the $M_i$ into

granular gases. The systems consist of mono-disperse particles with additional
non-contact (long-range) interactions, and are simulated here by the
event-driven molecular dynamics algorithm with discrete (short-range shoulders
or wells) potentials (in both 2D and 3D). Astonishingly good agreement is found
with a mean field theory, where only the energy dissipation term is modified to
account for both repulsive or attractive non-contact interactions. Attractive
potentials enhance cooling and structure formation (clustering), whereas
repulsive potentials reduce it, as intuition suggests. The system evolution is
controlled by a single parameter: the non-contact potential strength scaled by
the fluctuation kinetic energy (granular temperature). When this is small, as
expected, the classical homogeneous cooling state is found. However, if the
effective dissipation is strong enough, structure formation proceeds, before
(in the repulsive case) non-contact forces get strong enough to undo the
clustering (due to the ongoing dissipation of granular temperature). For both
repulsive and attractive potentials, in the homogeneous regime, the cooling
shows a universal behaviour when the (inverse) control parameter is used as
evolution variable instead of time. The transition to a non-homogeneous regime,
as predicted by stability analysis, is affected by both dissipation and
potential strength. This can be cast into a phase diagram where the system
changes with time, which leaves open many challenges for future research.

scaling with respect to some quantum chromodynamics parameters. A quantum
mechanical model is introduced to describe the system with a one-body bare
state coupled with a single elastic two-body scattering. The general behavior
of the energy of the bound and resonance state near the two-body threshold for
a local potential is derived from the expansion of the Jost function around the
threshold. It is shown that the same scaling holds for the nonlocal potential
induced by the coupling to a bare state. In p or higher partial waves, the
scaling law of the stable bound state continues across the threshold describing
the real part of the resonance energy. In contrast, the leading contribution of
the scaling is forbidden by the nonperturbative dynamics near the s-wave
threshold. As a consequence, the bound state energy is not continuously
connected to the real part of the resonance energy. This universal behavior
originates in the vanishing of the field renormalization constant of the
zero-energy resonance in the s wave. A proof is given for the vanishing of the
field renormalization constant, together with a detailed discussion.

scalar and matter particles in the context of atomic physics. We focus on the
displacement of the atomic energy levels that it induces, and in particular the
change in the Lamb shift between the 2s and 2p states. We find that the
correction to the Lamb shift depends on the mass of the fermion orbiting around
the nucleus, implying a larger effect for muonic atoms. Taking the cut-off
scale describing the effective scalar field theory close to the QCD scale, we
find that the disformal interaction can account for the observed difference in
the proton radius of muonic versus electronic Hydrogen. Explaining the proton
radius puzzle is only possible when the scalar field is embedded in non-linear
theories which alleviate constraints from collider and stellar physics. Short
distance properties of the Galileon where non-perturbative effects in vacuum
are present ensure that unitarity is preserved in high energy particle
collisions. In matter, the chameleon mechanism alleviates the constraints on
disformal interactions coming from the burning rates for stellar objects. We
show how to combine these two properties in a single model which renders the
proposed explanation of the proton radius puzzle viable.

There is a strong spatial signature in the regional epidemic, with the risk of
transmission between territories estimated to be inversely proportional to the
distance rather than being driven by air transportation. So far, this simple

structure allows ranking territories according to their current risk of

optimize resource allocation for monitoring and control and encourage
territories with elevated risks to act. This is important to reduce the risk of

account the cooling of the interstellar medium. Motivated by the association of
the CO clouds with the enhancement of HI gas density, we carried out MHD
simulations of the propagation of a supersonic jet injected into the dense HI
gas. We found that the HI gas compressed by the bow shock ahead of the jet is
cooled down by growth of the cooling instability triggered by the density
enhancement. As a result, cold dense sheath is formed around the interface
between the jet and the HI gas. The radial speed of the cold, dense gas in the
sheath is a few km/s almost independent of the jet speed. Molecular clouds can
be formed in this region. Since the dense sheath wrapping the jet reflects
waves generated in the cocoon, the jet is strongly perturbed by the vortices of
the warm gas in the cocoon, which breaks up the jet and forms a secondary shock
in the HI-cavity drilled by the jet. The particle acceleration at the shock can
be the origin of radio and X-ray filaments observed near the eastern edge of
W50 nebula surrounding the galactic jet source SS433.

$\bar{\phi}_{{P}}$ and chain length $N$ (keeping the length ratio of

temperature-dependent behavior of micelles are studied, in amphiphilic
symmetric ABA triblock copolymer solutions. When chain length is increased, at
fixed $\bar{\phi}_{{P}}$, micelles occur at higher temperature. The variations
of average volume fraction of stickers $\bar{\phi}_\textrm{co}^\textrm{s}$ and
the lattice site numbers $N_\textrm{co}^\textrm{ls}$ at the micellar cores with
temperature are dependent on $N$ and $\bar{\phi}_{{P}}$, which demonstrates
that the aggregation of micelles depends on $N$ and $\bar{\phi}_{{P}}$.
Moreover, when $\bar{\phi}_{{P}}$ is increased, firstly a peak appears on the
curve of specific heat $C_V$ for unimer-micelle transition, and then in
addition a primary peak, the secondary peak, which results from the
remicellization, is observed on the curve of $C_V$. For a long chain, in
intermediate and high concentration regimes, the shape of specific heat peak
markedly changes, and the peak tends to be a more broad peak. Finally, the
aggregation behavior of micelles is explained by the aggregation way of
amphiphilic triblock copolymer. The obtained results are helpful in
understanding the micellar aggregation process.

vanishingly small close to the threshold. The dominating spin-independent (SI)

for a bounded function $m\colon [0,\infty)^d\to \mathbb{C},$ the multiplier

application we derive various multivariate multiplier theorems for particular
systems of operators acting on separate variables. These include e.g.
Ornstein-Uhlenbeck, Hermite, Laguerre, Bessel, Jacobi, and Dunkl operators. In
some particular cases, we obtain presumably sharp results. Additionally, we
demonstrate how a (bounded) holomorphic functional calculus for a pair of
commuting operators, is useful in the study of dimension free boundedness of

and Banach spaces. Our main result is that in uniformly smooth Banach spaces a
quasihyperbolic ball of a convex domain is $C^1$-smooth. The question about the
smoothness of quasihyperbolic balls is old, originating back to the discussions
of F.W. Gehring and M. Vuorinen in 1970's. To our belief, the result is new
also in the Euclidean setting. We also address some other issues involving the
smoothness of quasihyperbolic balls.
  We introduce an interesting application of quasihyperbolic metrics to
renormings of Banach spaces. To provide a useful tool for this approach we turn
our attention to the variational stability of quasihyperbolic geodesics.
Several examples and illustrations are provided.

Way in order to learn more about the conditions under which the population of
halo stars was born, such as the initial mass function (IMF), the star
formation history, or the binary fraction. Methods: We simulate the evolution
of low-metallicity halo stars at distances up to ~ 3 kpc using the binary
population synthesis code SeBa. We use two different white dwarf cooling models
to predict the present-day luminosities of halo white dwarfs. We determine the
white dwarf luminosity functions (WDLFs) for eight different halo models and
compare these with the observed halo WDLF of white dwarfs in the SuperCOSMOS
Sky Survey. Furthermore, we predict the properties of binary white dwarfs in
the halo and determine the number of halo white dwarfs that is expected to be
observed with the Gaia satellite. Results: By comparing the WDLFs, we find that
a standard IMF matches the observations more accurately than a top-heavy one,
but the difference with a bottom-heavy IMF is small. A burst of star formation
13 Gyr ago fits slightly better than a star formation burst 10 Gyr ago and also
slightly better than continuous star formation $10-13$ Gyrs ago. Gaia will be
the first instrument to constrain the bright end of the field halo WDLF, where
contributions from binary WDs are considerable. Many of these will have He
cores, of which a handful have atypical surface gravities ($\log g < 6$) and
reach luminosities $\log(L/L_\odot) > 0$ in our standard model for WD cooling.
These so called pre-WDs, if observed, can help us to constrain white dwarf
cooling models and might teach us something about the fraction of halo stars
that reside in binaries.

Spectrograph, we study the nature of an isolated disk galaxy, SDSS
J090005.05+000446.7 (z = 0.05386). In the integral field datasets, the galaxy
presents skewed line profiles changing with position in the galaxy. The skewed
line profiles are caused by different kinematic components overlapping in the
line-of-sight direction. We perform spectral decomposition to separate the line
profiles in each spatial pixel as combinations of (1) a narrow kinematic
component consistent with HII regions, (2) a broad kinematic component
consistent with shock excitation, and (3) an intermediate component consistent
with shock excitation and photoionisation mixing. The three kinematic
components have distinctly different velocity fields, velocity dispersions,
line ratios, and electron densities. We model the line ratios, velocity
dispersions, and electron densities with our MAPPINGS IV shock and
photoionisation models, and we reach remarkable agreement between the data and
the models. The models demonstrate that the different emission line properties
are caused by major galactic outflows that introduce shock excitation in
addition to photoionisation by star-forming activities. Interstellar shocks
embedded in the outflows shock-excite and compress the gas, causing the
elevated line ratios, velocity dispersions, and electron densities observed in
the broad kinematic component. We argue from energy considerations that, with
the lack of a powerful active galactic nucleus, the outflows are likely to be
driven by starburst activities. Our results set a benchmark of the type of
analysis that can be achieved by the SAMI Galaxy Survey on large numbers of
galaxies.

shoals, insect swarms and mammal herds. It is thought to improve collective
awareness and offer protection from predators. Many current models involve the
hypothesis that information coordinating motion is exchanged between neighbors.
We argue that such local interactions alone are insufficient to explain the
organization of large flocks of birds and that the mechanism for the exchange
of long-ranged information necessary to control their density remains unknown.
We show that large flocks self-organize to the maximum density at which a
typical individual is still just able to see out of the flock in many
directions. Such flocks are marginally opaque - an external observer can also
just still see a substantial fraction of sky through the flock. Although
seemingly intuitive we show that this need not be the case; flocks could easily
be highly diffuse or entirely opaque. The emergence of marginal opacity
strongly constrains how individuals interact with each other within large
swarms. It also provides a mechanism for global interactions: An individual can
respond to the projection of the flock that it sees. This provides for faster
information transfer and hence rapid flock dynamics, another advantage over
local models. From a behavioural perspective it optimizes the information
available to each bird while maintaining the protection of a dense, coherent
flock.

interferometer using sparse modeling. In standard radio interferometry,
sampling of ($u$, $v$) is quite often incomplete and thus obtaining an image
from observed visibilities becomes an underdetermined problem, and a technique
so-called ""zero-padding"" is often used to fill up unsampled grids in ($u$, $v$)
plane, resulting in image degradation by finite beam size as well as numerous
side-lobes. In this paper we show that directly solving such an underdetermined
problem based on sparse modeling (in this paper LASSO) avoids the above
problems introduced by zero-padding, leading to super-resolution images in
which structure finer than the standard beam size (diffraction limit) can be
reproduced. We present results of one-dimensional and two-dimensional
simulations of interferometric imaging, and discuss its implications to
super-resolution imaging, particularly focusing on imaging of black hole
shadows with millimeter VLBI.

initial cluster masses required by other models for the formation of multiple
stellar generations. We numerically follow the evolution of the accreting
stars, and we show that the structure of the seed star does not remain fully
convective for the whole duration of the accretion phase. Stellar populations
showing discrete abundances of helium in the core, that seem to be present in
some clusters, might be formed with this mechanism only if accretion occurs
before the core of the stars become radiative (within 2-3Myr) or if a
thermohaline instability is triggered, to achieve full mixing after the
accretion phase ends. We also show that the lithium abundances in accreted
structures may vary by orders of magnitude in equal masses obtained by
accreting different masses. In addition, the same thermohaline mixing which
could provide a homogeneous helium distribution down to the stellar center,
would destroy any lithium surviving in the envelope, so that both helium
homogeneity and lithium survival require that the accretion phase be limited to
the first couple of million years of the cluster evolution. Such a short
accretion phase strongly reduces the amount of processed matter available, and
reintroduces the requirement of an extremely large initial mass for the
protocluster.

star formation has been fiercely debated in the last two decades. A multitude
of scenarios have been proposed, from a hot corino to PDRs on cavity walls to
shock excitation.
  Aims: The aim of this paper is to determine the location and the
corresponding physical conditions of the gas responsible for organics emission
lines. The outflows around the small protocluster NGC 2071 are an ideal testbed
to differentiate between various scenarios.
  Methods: Using Herschel-HIFI and the SMA, observations of CH3OH, H2CO and
CH3CN emission lines over a wide range of excitation energies were obtained.
Comparisons to a grid of radiative transfer models provide constraints on the
physical conditions. Comparison to H2O line shape is able to trace gas-phase
synthesis versus a sputtered origin.
  Results: Emission of organics originates in three spots: the continuum
sources IRS 1 ('B') and IRS 3 ('A') as well as a outflow position ('F').
Densities are above 10$^7$ cm$^{-3}$ and temperatures between 100 to 200 K.
CH3OH emission observed with HIFI originates in all three regions and cannot be
associated with a single region. Very little organic emission originates
outside of these regions.
  Conclusions: Although the three regions are small (<1,500 AU), gas-phase
organics likely originate from sputtering of ices due to outflow activity. The
derived high densities (>10$^7$ cm$^{-3}$) are likely a requirement for organic
molecules to survive from being destroyed by shock products. The lack of
spatially extended emission confirms that organic molecules cannot (re)form
through gas-phase synthesis, as opposed to H2O, which shows strong line wing
emission. The lack of CH3CN emission at 'F' is evidence for a different history
of ice processing due to the absence of a protostar at that location and recent
ice mantle evaporation.

choices, there is only one known prescription which leads to the generic
bounded behavior of these scalars. The bounds turn out to be universal and are
determined by the underlying quantum geometry. This quantization is analogous
to the so called 'improved dynamics' in the isotropic loop quantum cosmology,
which is also the only one to respect the freedom of the rescaling of the
fiducial cell at the level of effective spacetime description. Other proposed
quantization prescriptions yield expansion and shear scalars which may not be
bounded for certain initial conditions within the validity of effective
spacetime description. These prescriptions also have a limitation that the
""quantum geometric effects"" can occur at an arbitrary scale. We show that the
`improved dynamics' of Kantowski-Sachs spacetime turns out to be a unique
choice in a general class of possible quantization prescriptions, in the sense
of leading to generic bounds on expansion and shear scalars and the associated
physics being free from fiducial cell dependence. The behavior of the energy
density in the `improved dynamics' reveals some interesting features. Even
without considering any details of the dynamical evolution, it is possible to
rule out pancake singularities in this spacetime. The energy density is found
to be dynamically bounded. These results show that the Planck scale physics of
the loop quantized Kantowski-Sachs spacetime has key features common with the
loop quantization of isotropic and Bianchi-I spacetimes.

When the opportunistic data are abundant, the gain in precision may be
considerable, especially for the rare species. We also show that estimates can
be obtained even for species recorded only in the opportunistic scheme.
Opportunistic data combined with a relatively small amount of data collected

to real pre-ordered Banach spaces, as is done classically, but can be extended

  We define geometric notions of normality, conormality, additivity and

possible interactions between two cones and two convex convex sets containing

quantum macroscopicity based on the quantum Fisher information in several
examples. Both cluster states and Kitaev surface code states are found to not
be macroscopically quantum but can be distilled into macroscopic
superpositions. We look at these distillation protocols in more detail and ask
whether they are robust to perturbations. One key result is that
one-dimensional cluster states are not distilled robustly but
higher-dimensional cluster states are.

wider wavenumber spectra, larger values of kurtosis and higher probability of

525 nm images taken by Sunrise on 9 June 2009. The function of region growing
and mean shift procedure are applied to segment the bright points (BPs) and
granules, respectively. Zernike moments of each region are computed. The
Zernike moments of BPs, granules, and other features are distinctive enough to
be separated using a support vector machine (SVM) classifier. The size
distribution of BPs can be fitted with a power-law slope -1.5. The peak value
of granule sizes is found to be about 0.5 arcsec^2. The mean value of the
filling factor of BPs is 0.01, and for granules it is 0.51. There is a critical
scale for granules so that small granules with sizes smaller than 2.5 arcsec^2
cover a wide range of brightness, while the brightness of large granules
approaches unity. The mean value of BP brightness fluctuations is estimated to
be 1.2, while for granules it is 0.22. Mean values of the horizontal velocities
of an individual BP and an individual BP within the network were found to be
1.6 km/s and 0.9 km/s, respectively. We conclude that the effect of individual
BPs in releasing energy to the photosphere and maybe the upper layers is
stronger than what the individual BPs release into the network.

model of non-absorbing, Rayleigh-scattering dust in the planetary atmosphere
(Pont et al. 2013), we also re-interpret the available data with a clear
planetary atmosphere. In the latter interpretation, the slope of increasing
transit depth with shorter wavelengths from the near infrared, through the
visible and into the ultraviolet is caused by unocculted star spots, with a
smaller contribution of Rayleigh scattering by molecular hydrogen in the
planet's atmosphere. At relevant pressures along the terminator, our model
planetary atmosphere's temperature is ~700 K, which is below the condensation
temperatures of sodium- and potassium-bearing molecules, causing the broad
wings of the spectral lines of Na I and K I at 0.589 um and 0.769 um to be
weak.

function, which depends not only on the distance between two carbon atoms, but
also on the positions of neighboring atoms as well. Using the Lanczos algorithm
for the numerical evaluation of eigenvalues of large sparse matrices, we
calculate the bilayer single-electron spectrum for commensurate twist angles in
the range $1^{\circ}\lesssim\theta\lesssim30^{\circ}$. We show that at certain
angles $\theta$ greater than $\theta_{c}\approx1.89^{\circ}$ the electronic
spectrum acquires a finite gap, whose value could be as large as $80$ meV.
However, in an infinitely large and perfectly clean sample the gap as a
function of $\theta$ behaves non-monotonously, demonstrating
exponentially-large jumps for very small variations of $\theta$. This
sensitivity to the angle makes it impossible to predict the gap value for a
given sample, since in experiment $\theta$ is always known with certain error.
To establish the connection with experiments, we demonstrate that for a system
of finite size $\tilde L$ the gap becomes a smooth function of the twist angle.
If the sample is infinite, but disorder is present, we expect that the electron
mean-free path plays the same role as $\tilde L$. In the regime of small angles
$\theta<\theta_c$, the system is a metal with a well-defined Fermi surface
which is reduced to Fermi points for some values of $\theta$. The density of
states in the metallic phase varies smoothly with $\theta$.

\emph{displacement} of $e$ along a morphism $\varepsilon: p(e) \rightarrow b$,
as a map $e \rightarrow \nabla_\varepsilon(e)$ satisfying a universal property
analogue to that of a \emph{cocartesian lifting} (pushforward) \emph{\`a la}
B\'enabou-Grothendieck-Street. There are many difficulties in geometry that
come from the fact that forgetful functors such as $p: Var(\mathbf{C})
\rightarrow Top $ don't have displacements of objects along arbitrary maps. And
this can be already seen abstractly, since the existence of a left adjoint to
$p$, can be reduced to the existence of all displacements of the initial
object. However some \emph{schematization functors} exist as approximations. In
a broader context, if $B$ is a model category and $p$ is a right adjoint, then
the right-induced model category on $E$ exists if and only if all displacements
along any trivial cofibration $\varepsilon$, are weak $p$-equivalences. In
these notes we provide some categorical lemmas that will be necessary for
future applications. The idea is to have a \emph{homotopy descent process} for
\emph{elementary displacements} when $p$ has a \emph{presentation} as a
$2$-pullback of a family $\{p_i: E_i \rightarrow B\}_{i\in J}$. When suitably
applied it should lead to techniques similar to Mumford's GIT through homotopy
theory (simplicial presheaves).

infer the ancestral relationship of the individuals. Within the classical
infinitely many sites model, it is possible to estimate the mutation rate based
on the site frequency spectrum, which is comprised by the numbers
$C_1,...,C_{n-1}$, where n is the sample size and $C_s$ is the number of site
mutations (Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms, SNPs) which are seen in $s$
genomes. Classical results can be used to compare the observed site frequency
spectrum with its neutral expectation, $E[C_s]= \theta_2/s$, where $\theta_2$
is the scaled site mutation rate. In this paper, we will relax the assumption
of the infinitely many sites model that all individuals only carry homologous
genetic material. Especially, it is today well-known that bacterial genomes
have the ability to gain and lose genes, such that every single genome is a
mosaic of genes, and genes are present and absent in a random fashion, giving
rise to the dispensable genome. While this presence and absence has been
modeled under neutral evolution within the infinitely many genes model in
previous papers, we link presence and absence of genes with the numbers of site
mutations seen within each gene. In this work we derive a formula for the
expectation of the joint gene and site frequency spectrum, denotes $G_{k,s}$
the number of mutated sites occurring in exactly $s$ gene sequences, while the
corresponding gene is present in exactly $k$ individuals. We show that standard
estimators of $\theta_2$ for dispensable genes are biased and that the site
frequency spectrum for dispensable genes differs from the classical result.

differential polarimetry suppresses unpolarized starlight by a factor of over
100, and provides sensitivity to circumstellar dust reaching the photon noise
limit for these observations. In the case of the circumstellar disk around HR
4796A, GPI's advanced adaptive optics system reveals the disk clearly even
prior to PSF subtraction. In polarized light, the disk is seen all the way in
to its semi-minor axis for the first time. The disk exhibits surprisingly
strong asymmetry in polarized intensity, with the west side >9 times brighter
than the east side despite the fact that the east side is slightly brighter in
total intensity. Based on a synthesis of the total and polarized intensities,
we now believe that the west side is closer to us, contrary to most prior
interpretations. Forward scattering by relatively large silicate dust particles
leads to the strong polarized intensity on the west side, and the ring must be
slightly optically thick in order to explain the lower brightness in total
intensity there. These findings suggest that the ring is geometrically narrow
and dynamically cold, perhaps shepherded by larger bodies in the same manner as
Saturn's F ring.

we describe this interpretation for all conformal four-point integrals. Using
this interpretation, we give a representation-theoretic proof of an operator
version of the ""magic identities"" for the conformal four-point integrals
described by the box diagrams.
  The original ""magic identities"" are due to J.M.Drummond, J.Henn, V.A.Smirnov
and E.Sokatchev, they assert that all n-loop box integrals for four scalar
massless particles are equal to each other [DHSS]. The authors give a proof of
the magic identities for the Euclidean metric case only and claim that the
result is also true for the Minkowski metric case. However, the Minkowski case
is much more subtle. In this article we prove an operator version of the magic
identities in the Minkowski metric case and, in particular, specify the
relative positions of cycles of integration that make these identities correct.
  No prior knowledge of physics or Feynman diagrams is assumed from the reader.
We provide a summary of all relevant results from quaternionic analysis to make
the article self-contained.

eigenvalue counting function $N(s) = \#\{\lambda _j: 0 \leq \lambda _j \leq

functions $N^{\pm}(s) = \#\{\lambda _j: 0 < \pm \lambda _j \leq s\}$ and they

$\frac{\pi^2}{4}s^2$ and a correction term of $as^{3/2}$ where the constant $a$

a speed of propagation constant to the wave operator the result depends on

active galaxies the H_2 kinematics reveal inflow and outflow superimposed on
disk rotation. Steady-state circumnuclear inflow is seen in three AGN, and
hydrodynamical models indicate it can be driven by a large scale bar. In three
of the five AGN, molecular outflows are spatially resolved. The outflows are
oriented such that they intersect, or have an edge close to, the disk - which
may be the source of molecular gas in the outflow. The relatively low speeds
imply the gas will fall back onto the disk; and with moderate outflow rates,
they will have only a local impact on the host galaxy. H_2 was detected in two
inactive galaxies. These exhibit chaotic circumnuclear dust morphologies and
have molecular structures that are counter-rotating with respect to the main
gas component, which could lead to gas inflow in the near future. In our
sample, all four galaxies with chaotic dust morphology in the circumnuclear
region exist in moderately dense groups with 10-15 members where accretion of

salesman problem on a graph metric (graph-TSP), which yields a
$4/3$-approximation guarantee on subcubic graphs as well as a substantial
improvement over the $3/2$-approximation guarantee of Christofides' algorithm
on general graphs. The crux of their approach is to compute an upper bound on
the minimum cost of a circulation in a particular network, $C(G,T)$, where $G$
is the input graph and $T$ is a carefully chosen spanning tree. The cost of
this circulation is directly related to the number of edges in a tour output by
their algorithm. Mucha subsequently improved the analysis of the circulation
cost, proving that M\""omke and Svensson's algorithm for graph-TSP has an
approximation ratio of at most $13/9$ on general graphs.
  This analysis of the circulation is local, and vertices with degree four and
five can contribute the most to its cost. Thus, hypothetically, there could
exist a subquartic graph (a graph with degree at most four at each vertex) for
which Mucha's analysis of the M\""omke-Svensson algorithm is tight. We show that
this is not the case and that M\""omke and Svensson's algorithm for graph-TSP

prove this, we present different methods to upper bound the minimum cost of a

Space Telescope. We analyse these observations with simulations using the
radiative transfer code MCFOST to investigate the dust properties. We explore a

We detect the disc in polarised light in the Ks band and reveal for the first
time the innermost regions down to $0.3""$ along the semi-minor axis. We measure
a polarised fraction of $29\%\pm8\%$ in the two disc ansae, with a maximum
occurring more than $13^\circ$ westwards from the ansae. A very pronounced
brightness asymmetry between the north-west and south-east side is detected.
This contradicts the asymmetry previously reported in all images of the disc in

inconsistent with the predicted scattered light from spherical grains using the
Mie theory. Our modelling suggests the north-west side is most likely inclined

boron-to-carbon ratio. This procedure is generically plagued with degeneracies
between the diffusion coefficient and the vertical extent of the Galactic
magnetic halo. The latter is of paramount importance for indirect dark matter
(DM) searches, because it fixes the amount of DM annihilation or decay that
contributes to the local antimatter CR flux. These degeneracies could be broken
by using secondary radioactive species, but the current data still have large
error bars, and this method is extremely sensitive to the very local
interstellar medium (ISM) properties. Here, we propose to use the low-energy CR
positrons in the GeV range as another direct constraint on diffusion models. We
show that the PAMELA data disfavor small diffusion halo ($L\lesssim 3$ kpc) and
large diffusion slope models, and exclude the minimal ({\em min}) configuration
(Maurin et al. 2001, Donato et al. 2004) widely used in the literature to
bracket the uncertainties in the DM signal predictions. This is complementary
to indirect constraints (diffuse radio and gamma-ray emissions) and has strong
impact on DM searches. Indeed this makes the antiproton constraints more robust
while enhancing the discovery/exclusion potential of current and future
experiments, like AMS-02 and GAPS, especially in the antiproton and

algorithms, there are often some additional data such as users' social circles

  Transfer learning (TL) is proposed to extract and transfer knowledge from

First, we give a formal definition of transfer learning for CRAD (TL-CRAD).
Second, we extend the existing categorization of TL techniques (i.e., adaptive,

build hexagonal raster using information from a rectangular raster data (e.g.
GIS format), data porting. This tool involves a computational algorithm and an
open source software (written in C). The method of extending the reticulated
functions defined on 2D networks is an essential key of this algorithm and can
also be used for other purposes than data porting. The algorithm allows one to
build the hexagonal raster with a cell size independent from the geometry of
the rectangular raster. The extended function is a bi-cubic spline which can
exactly reconstruct polynomials up to degree three in each variable. We
validate the method by analyzing errors in some theoretical case studies
followed by other studies with real terrain elevation data. We also introduce
and briefly present an iterative water routing method and use it for validation
on a case with concrete terrain data.

  Tests",,,,,"cs.FL cs.LO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We first propose algorithms for checking language equivalence of finite
automata over a large alphabet. We use symbolic automata, where the transition
function is compactly represented using a (multi-terminal) binary decision
diagrams (BDD). The key idea consists in computing a bisimulation by exploring
reachable pairs symbolically, so as to avoid redundancies. This idea can be
combined with already existing optimisations, and we show in particular a nice
integration with the disjoint sets forest data-structure from Hopcroft and
Karp's standard algorithm. Then we consider Kleene algebra with tests (KAT), an
algebraic theory that can be used for verification in various domains ranging
from compiler optimisation to network programming analysis. This theory is
decidable by reduction to language equivalence of automata on guarded strings,
a particular kind of automata that have exponentially large alphabets. We
propose several methods allowing to construct symbolic automata out of KAT
expressions, based either on Brzozowski's derivatives or standard automata
constructions. All in all, this results in efficient algorithms for deciding
equivalence of KAT expressions.
