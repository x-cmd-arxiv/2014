we constructively prove that indeed the Uniform Circle Formation problem is
solvable for any initial configuration in which the robots are in distinct

  quality functions for graph clustering",,,,,"stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Many graph clustering quality functions suffer from a resolution limit, the
inability to find small clusters in large graphs. So called
resolution-limit-free quality functions do not have this limit. This property
was previously introduced for hard clustering, that is, graph partitioning.
  We investigate the resolution-limit-free property in the context of
Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) for hard and soft graph clustering. To
use NMF in the hard clustering setting, a common approach is to assign each
node to its highest membership cluster. We show that in this case symmetric NMF
is not resolution-limit-free, but that it becomes so when hardness constraints
are used as part of the optimization. The resulting function is strongly linked
to the Constant Potts Model. In soft clustering, nodes can belong to more than
one cluster, with varying degrees of membership. In this setting
resolution-limit-free turns out to be too strong a property. Therefore we
introduce locality, which roughly states that changing one part of the graph
does not affect the clustering of other parts of the graph. We argue that this
is a desirable property, provide conditions under which NMF quality functions
are local, and propose a novel class of local probabilistic NMF quality
functions for soft graph clustering.

it is a local minimizer of the free energy in an $L^1$ neighbourhood of its
deformation. The reason behind this result is that, due to the incompatibility
of the energy wells, a small nucleus of the product phase is necessarily
accompanied by a stressed transition layer whose energetic cost exceeds the
energy lowering capacity of the nucleus. We define and characterize
incompatible sets of matrices, in terms of which the transition layer estimate
at the heart of the proof of metastability is expressed. Finally we discuss

insulating state and an antiferromagnetic (AFM) state. Optical lattices filled
with a two-spin-component Fermi gas of ultracold atoms can faithfully realise
the Hubbard model with readily tunable parameters, and thus provide a platform
for the systematic exploration of its phase diagram. Realisation of strongly
correlated phases, however, has been hindered by the need to cool the atoms to
temperatures as low as the magnetic exchange energy, and also by the lack of
reliable thermometry. Here we demonstrate spin-sensitive Bragg scattering of
light to measure AFM spin correlations in a realisation of the 3D Hubbard model
at temperatures down to 1.4 times that of the AFM phase transition. This
temperature regime is beyond the range of validity of a simple high-temperature
series expansion, which brings our experiment close to the limit of the
capabilities of current numerical techniques. We reach these low temperatures
using a unique compensated optical lattice technique, in which the confinement
of each lattice beam is compensated by a blue-detuned laser beam. The
temperature of the atoms in the lattice is deduced by comparing the light
scattering to determinantal quantum Monte Carlo and numerical linked-cluster
expansion calculations. Further refinement of the compensated lattice may
produce even lower temperatures which, along with light scattering thermometry,
would open avenues for achieving and characterising other novel quantum states
of matter, such as the pseudogap regime of the 2D Hubbard model.

Majorana-like modes (quasi-particles which are self-conjugate) close to the
experimentally inaccessible Dirac points of a two-dimensional monolayer Dirac
system. The valley-mixing and the spin-degeneracy lifting are the main
requirements. These are possible by wedging in the requisite ingredients in the
description, viz. the atomically sharp scatterers and the strong spin-orbit
coupling (SOC). The latter can possibly be achieved in graphene folding a
sheet; the higher curvature of deformations correspond to stronger values of
the coupling. In silicene, the buckled structure of the system generates a
staggered sub-lattice potential between silicon atoms at A sites and B sites
for an applied electric field perpendicular to its plane. The stronger SOC in
silicene has its origin also in the buckled structure of the system. Tuning of
electric field, allows for rich behavior varying from a topological insulator
to a normal insulator with a valley spin-polarized metal (VSPM) at a critical
value in between. The VSPM stage is characterized by the valley-spin locking,
i.e. the opposite spin polarization at different valleys. We shall see that in
this phase, if the inter-valley scattering process and the real spin-flip
process in moderation are allowed to take place, we have the right condition
for capturing Majoranas in the proximity of a s-wave superconductor.

surprising since numerical simulations have shown that the vastly different
interiors of terrestrial and gas planets can strongly affect the internal
dynamo process. Here we present the first numerical dynamo that manages to
match the structure and strength of the observed magnetic field by embracing
the newest models for Jupiter's interior. Simulated dynamo action primarily
occurs in the deep high electrical conductivity region while zonal flows are
dynamically constrained to a strong equatorial jet in the outer envelope of low
conductivity. Our model reproduces the structure and strength of the observed
global magnetic field and predicts that secondary dynamo action associated to
the equatorial jet produces banded magnetic features likely observable by the
Juno mission. Secular variation in our model scales to about 2000 nT per year
and should also be observable during the one year nominal mission duration.

heated and how the solar wind is accelerated. Some models assume that open
magnetic field lines are heated by Alfven waves driven by photospheric motions
and dissipated after undergoing a turbulent cascade. Other models posit that
much of the solar wind's mass and energy is injected via magnetic reconnection
from closed coronal loops. The latter idea is motivated by observations of
reconnecting jets and also by similarities of ion composition between closed
loops and the slow wind. Wave/turbulence models have also succeeded in
reproducing observed trends in ion composition signatures versus wind speed.
However, the absolute values of the charge-state ratios predicted by those
models tended to be too low in comparison with observations. This letter
refines these predictions by taking better account of weak Coulomb collisions
for coronal electrons, whose thermodynamic properties determine the ion charge
states in the low corona. A perturbative description of nonlocal electron
transport is applied to an existing set of wave/turbulence models. The
resulting electron velocity distributions in the low corona exhibit mild
suprathermal tails characterized by ""kappa"" exponents between 10 and 25. These
suprathermal electrons are found to be sufficiently energetic to enhance the
charge states of oxygen ions, while maintaining the same relative trend with
wind speed that was found when the distribution was assumed to be Maxwellian.
The updated wave/turbulence models are in excellent agreement with solar wind
ion composition measurements.

this relationship for populations of up to N=160 neurons in a small patch of

universality of one hidden layer network at approximating functions under weak

dynamical systems approximated or, given the space, reduce the number of units
required for a certain error. Traditionally shallow networks with manually
engineered features are used, back-propagation extent is limited to one and
attempt to choose a large number of hidden units to satisfy the Markov
condition is made. In case of Markov models, it has been shown that many
systems need to be modeled as higher order. In the present work, we present
deep recurrent networks with longer backpropagation through time extent as a
solution to modeling systems that are high order and to predicting ahead. We
study epileptic seizure suppression electro-stimulator. Extraction of manually
engineered complex features and prediction employing them has not allowed small
low-power implementations as, to avoid possibility of surgery, extraction of
any features that may be required has to be included. In this solution, a
recurrent neural network performs both feature extraction and prediction. We
prove analytically that adding hidden layers or increasing backpropagation
extent increases the rate of decrease of approximation error. A Dynamic
Programming (DP) training procedure employing matrix operations is derived. DP
and use of matrix operations makes the procedure efficient particularly when
using data-parallel computing. The simulation studies show the geometry of the

solve optimization problems posed on Riemannian manifolds. A new point of view
is offered for the solution of constrained optimization problems. Some
classical optimization techniques on Euclidean space are generalized to
Riemannian manifolds. Several algorithms are presented and their convergence
properties are analyzed employing the Riemannian structure of the manifold.
Specifically, two apparently new algorithms, which can be thought of as
Newton's method and the conjugate gradient method on Riemannian manifolds, are
presented and shown to possess, respectively, quadratic and superlinear
convergence. Examples of each method on certain Riemannian manifolds are given
with the results of numerical experiments. Rayleigh's quotient defined on the
sphere is one example. It is shown that Newton's method applied to this
function converges cubically, and that the Rayleigh quotient iteration is an
efficient approximation of Newton's method. The Riemannian version of the
conjugate gradient method applied to this function gives a new algorithm for
finding the eigenvectors corresponding to the extreme eigenvalues of a
symmetric matrix. Another example arises from extremizing the function
$\mathop{\rm tr} {\Theta}^{\scriptscriptstyle\rm T}Q{\Theta}N$ on the special
orthogonal group. In a similar example, it is shown that Newton's method
applied to the sum of the squares of the off-diagonal entries of a symmetric
matrix converges cubically.

and eventually developed a spectacular light echo. A very red star emerged a
few months after the outburst. The whole event has been interpreted as the
result of a merger. Methods. We obtained near-IR and mid-IR interferometric
observations of V838 Mon with the AMBER and MIDI recombiners located at the
Very Large Telescope Interferometer (VLTI) array. The MIDI two-beam
observations were obtained with the 8m Unit Telescopes between October 2011 and
February 2012. The AMBER three-beam observations were obtained with the compact
array (B$\leq$m) in April 2013 and the long array (B$\leq$140m) in May 2014,
using the 1.8m Auxiliary Telescopes. Results. A significant new result is the
detection of a compact structure around V838 Mon, as seen from MIDI data. The
extension of the structure increases from a FWHM of 25 mas at 8 {\mu}m to 70
mas at 13 {\mu}m. At the adopted distance of D = 6.1 $\pm$ 0.6 kpc, the dust is
distributed from about 150 to 400 AU around V838 Mon. The MIDI visibilities
reveal a flattened structure whose aspect ratio increases with wavelength. The
major axis is roughly oriented around a position angle of -10 degrees, which
aligns with previous polarimetric studies reported in the literature. This
flattening can be interpreted as a relic of the 2002 eruption or by the
influence of the currently embedded B3V companion. The AMBER data provide a new
diameter for the pseudo-photosphere, which shows that its diameter has
decreased by about 40% in 10yrs, reaching a radius R$_*$ = 750 $\pm$ 200
R$_{\odot}$ (3.5 $\pm$ 1.0 AU). Conclusions. After the 2002 eruption,
interpreted as the merging of two stars, it seems that the resulting source is
relaxing to a normal state. The nearby environment exhibits an equatorial
over-density of dust up to several hundreds of AU.

stars might be the result of a double-degenerate merger of two white dwarfs
(WDs), or a final helium shell flash in a planetary nebula central star. In
this context, any information on the geometry of their circumstellar
environment and, in particular, the potential detection of elongated
structures, is of great importance. Methods : We obtained near-IR observations
of V854 Cen with the AMBER recombiner located at the Very Large Telescope
Interferometer (VLTI) array with the compact array (B$\leq$35m) in 2013 and the
long array (B$\leq$140m) in 2014. At each time, V854 Cen was at maximum light.
The $H$- and $K$-band continua were investigated by means of spectrally
dependant geometric models. These data were supplemented with mid-IR VISIR/VLT
images. Results : A dusty slightly elongated over density is discovered both in
the $H$- and $K$-band images. With the compact array, the central star is
unresolved ($\Theta\leq2.5$\,mas), but a flattened dusty environment of $8
\times 11$ mas is discovered whose flux increases from about $\sim$20% in the
$H$ band to reach about $\sim$50% at 2.3$\micron$, which indicates hot
(T$\sim$1500\,K) dust in the close vicinity of the star. The major axis is
oriented at a position angle (P.A.) of 126$\pm$29$\deg$. Adding the long-array
configuration dataset provides tighter constraints on the star diameter
($\Theta\leq1.0$ mas), a slight increase of the overdensity to $12 \times 15$
mas and a consistent P.A. of 133$\pm$49$\deg$. The closure phases, sensitive to
asymmetries, are null and compatible with a centro-symmetric, unperturbed
environment excluding point sources at the level of 3% of the total flux in
2013 and 2014. The VISIR images exhibit a flattened aspect ratio at the 15-20%
level at larger distances ($\sim$1$\arcsec$) with a position angle of
92$\pm$19$\deg$, marginally consistent with the interferometric observations.
Conclusions : This is the first time that a moderately elongated structure has
been observed around an RCB star. These observations confirm the numerous
suggestions for a bipolar structure proposed for this star in the literature,
which were mainly based on polarimetric and spectroscopic observations.

Bateman-Horn's conjectures (suggest that the probability of a large positive
integer being $x$ a prime - $\frac {1} {\ln(x)}$) it follows that the events
consisting in a positive integer $x$ being not divisible by different primes
are dependent with the ratio $0,5e^{\gamma}$ ($\gamma$ - Euler's constant). In
establishing Hardy-Littlewood's and Bateman-Horn's conjectures, their authors
followed the first suggestion by another one assuming the independence of the
above-mentioned events, which on the basis of the first suggestion and Merten's
theorem is not exactly. This paper demonstrates why these suggestions do not
lead to an erroneous result using the Hardy-Littlewood's conjecture for twin
primes as an example. The author provides generalized conjectures, which if
taken together with the first suggestion, make Hardy-Littlewood's prime $k$ -
tuples and Bateman-Horn's conjectures true.

looses its energy while modes are tunneled outside the event horizon. It is
shown how the tunneling quantum field modes affect the geometry and how this
change in geometry is arrested in the quantum field. Exploiting this we
calculate the modified (nonthermal) radiation spectrum, associating energy
fluxes and discuss various issues related with these. The results obtained here
are often expected on physical grounds, but, importantly we find them in a
quantitative manner.

of 7 and 8 TeV, $J/\psi J/\psi$ and $J/\psi\psi(2S)$ pairs are observed, which
have been produced in the absence of any other activity inside the LHCb
acceptance that is sensitive to charged particles in the pseudorapidity ranges
$(-3.5,-1.5)$ and $(1.5,5.0)$. Searches are also performed for pairs of P-wave

measured to be $$ \begin{array}{rl} \sigma^{J/\psi J/\psi} &= 58\pm10{(\rm

69 {\rm\ nb}, \\ \sigma^{\chi_{c1}\chi_{c1}} &< 45 {\rm\ pb}, \\
\sigma^{\chi_{c2}\chi_{c2}} &< 141 {\rm\ pb}, \\ \end{array} $$ where the upper
limits are set at the 90% confidence level. The measured $J/\psi J/\psi$ and

Tomography (CT) images has potential to be an important tool in clinical
practice and research. State-of-the-art methods show performance of 79%
sensitivity or true-positive (TP) rate, at 10 false-positives (FP) per volume.
We design a two-tiered coarse-to-fine cascade framework to first operate a
highly sensitive candidate generation system at a maximum sensitivity of ~92%
but with high FP level (~50 per patient). Regions of interest (ROI) for lesion
candidates are generated in this step and function as input for the second
tier. In the second tier we generate N 2D views, via scale, random
translations, and rotations with respect to each ROI centroid coordinates.
These random views are used to train a deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
classifier. In testing, the CNN is employed to assign individual probabilities
for a new set of N random views that are averaged at each ROI to compute a
final per-candidate classification probability. This second tier behaves as a
highly selective process to reject difficult false positives while preserving
high sensitivities. We validate the approach on CT images of 59 patients (49
with sclerotic metastases and 10 normal controls). The proposed method reduces
the number of FP/vol. from 4 to 1.2, 7 to 3, and 12 to 9.5 when comparing a
sensitivity rates of 60%, 70%, and 80% respectively in testing. The
Area-Under-the-Curve (AUC) is 0.834. The results show marked improvement upon

field equations are flat connection conditions amounting to zero curvature and
parallel conditions on operators acting on H. This matrix-type model may give a
better defined setting for a quantum gravity path integral. We demonstrate that
its underlying physics is a summation over Hamiltonians labeled by a conformal
class of metrics and thus a sum over causal structures. This gives in turn a
model summing over fluctuating metrics plus a tower of additional modes-we
speculate that these could yield improved UV behavior.

Erdos-Renyi random graphs with edges forming between nodes in the community

methodology, we develop three algorithms: the Exhaustive Search (ES), the
mixture, and the Hierarchical Mixture (H-Mix) methods. Performance of these
methods is evaluated by the average run length (ARL), which captures the
frequency of false alarms, and the detection delay. Numerical comparisons show
that the ES method performs the best; however, it is exponentially complex. The
mixture method is polynomially complex by exploiting the fact that the size of
the community is typically small in a large network. However, it may react to a
group of active edges that do not form a community. This issue is resolved by
the H-Mix method, which is based on a dendrogram decomposition of the network.
We present an asymptotic analytical expression for ARL of the mixture method
when the threshold is large. Numerical simulation verifies that our
approximation is accurate even in the non-asymptotic regime. Hence, it can be
used to determine a desired threshold efficiently. Finally, numerical examples
show that the mixture and the H-Mix methods can both detect a community quickly
with a lower complexity than the ES method.

at the forefront of condensed matter research in recent years. It has been
found that systems of the same symmetry, previously thought of as equivalent,
may in fact be distinguished by their topological properties. Moreover, the
non-trivial topology found in some insulators and superconductors has profound
physical implications that can be observed experimentally and can potentially
be used for applications. However, characterizing a system's topology is not
always a simple task, even for a theoretical model. When translation and other
symmetries are present in a quadratic model the topological invariants are
readily defined and easily calculated in a variety of symmetry classes.
However, once interactions or disorder come into play the task becomes
difficult, and in many cases prohibitively so. The goal of this paper is to
suggest alternatives to the topological invariants which are based on the
entanglement spectrum and entanglement entropy. Using quadratic models of
superconductors we demonstrate that these entanglement properties are sensitive
to changes in topology. We choose quadratic models since the topological phase
diagram can be mapped using the topological invariants and then compared to the
entanglement entropy/spectrum features. This work sets the stage for learning
about topology in interacting and disordered systems through their entanglement
properties.

$\mathbb{Z}_{\pi}:=\mathbb{Z}[\pi]/(\pi^2-1)$ (here, setting $\pi$ to $\pm 1$
results either in even or odd Khovanov homology). The generalized homology has
$\Bbbk := \mathbb{Z}[X,Y,Z^{\pm 1}]/(X^2=Y^2=1)$ as coefficients, and the above
implies that most of automorphisms of $\Bbbk$ fix the isomorphism class of the
generalized homology regarded as $\Bbbk$-modules, so that the even and odd
Khovanov homology are the only two specializations of the invariant. In
particular, switching $X$ with $Y$ induces a derived isomorphism between the
generalized Khovanov homology of a link $L$ with its dual version, i.e. the
homology of the mirror image $L^!$, and we compute an explicit formula for this

temperatures that are too low to ionize helium. This means that the helium
should not contribute to the shaping of the main SN light curve, and thus the
total helium mass may be difficult to measure from simple light curve modeling.
Conversely, such modeling may be more useful for constraining the mass of the
carbon/oxygen core of the SN progenitor. Other stripped envelope SNe show
higher velocities and larger velocity gradients, which require an additional
opacity source (perhaps the mixing of heavier elements or radioactive nickel)
to prevent the helium from being transparent. We discuss ways in which similar
analysis can provide insights into the differences and similarities between SNe
Ib and Ic, which will lead to a better understanding of their respective

opportunity is now opening up with the large telescope arrays primarily erected
for measuring Cherenkov light in air induced by gamma rays. With suitable
software, such telescopes could be electronically connected and used also for
intensity interferometry. With no optical connection between the telescopes,
the error budget is set by the electronic time resolution of a few nanoseconds.
Corresponding light-travel distances are on the order of one meter, making the
method practically insensitive to atmospheric turbulence or optical
imperfections, permitting both very long baselines and observing at short
optical wavelengths. Theoretical modeling has shown how stellar surface images
can be retrieved from such observations and here we report on experimental
simulations. In an optical laboratory, artificial stars (single and double,
round and elliptic) are observed by an array of telescopes. Using high-speed
photon-counting solid-state detectors and real-time electronics, intensity
fluctuations are cross correlated between up to a hundred baselines between
pairs of telescopes, producing maps of the second-order spatial coherence
across the interferometric Fourier-transform plane. These experiments serve to
verify the concepts and to optimize the instrumentation and observing

either red submm sources trace a more clustered population than blue ones, and
their positional errors are increased by confusion; or red submm sources are
generally at high redshifts and are frequently associated with low-redshift
lensing structures which are identified as false counterparts. We perform
various analyses of the data, including the multiplicity of optical
associations, the redshift and magnitude distributions in H-ATLAS in comparison
to HerMES, and simulations of weak lensing, and we conclude that the effects

in direct dust growth and lead to the formation of planetesimals. Most previous
studies of the streaming instability, however, were focused on a local region
of a protoplanetary disk with a limited simulation domain such that only one
filamentary concentration of solids has been observed. The characteristic
separation between filaments is therefore not known. To address this, we
conduct the largest-scale simulations of the streaming instability to date,
with computational domains up to 1.6 gas scale heights both horizontally and
vertically. The large dynamical range allows the effect of vertical gas
stratification to become prominent. We observe more frequent merging and
splitting of filaments in simulation boxes of high vertical extent. We find
multiple filamentary concentrations of solids with an average separation of
about 0.2 local gas scale heights, much higher than the most unstable
wavelength from linear stability analysis. This measures the characteristic

of changes in partial coverage.

use these models to derive stellar mass-to-light ratios in the W1 and W2 bands.

10^7$ $M_\odot$) dwarfs are quenched, at higher masses the quenched fraction
decreases to approximately 40-50%. This change in the quenched fraction is
large, and suggests a sudden change in the effectiveness of quenching that
correlates with satellite mass. We combine this observation with models of
satellite infall and ram pressure stripping to show that the low mass
satellites must quench within 1-2 Gyr of pericenter passage to maintain a high
quenched fraction, but that many more massive dwarfs must continue to form
stars today even though they likely fell in to their host >5 Gyr ago. We also
characterize how the susceptibility of dwarfs to ram pressure must vary as a
function of mass if it is to account for the change in quenched fractions.
Though neither model predicts the quenching effectiveness a priori, this
modeling illustrates the physical requirements that the observed quenched
fractions place on possible quenching mechanisms.

$M_\oplus$ can migrate outward. Here we propose that an embryo's migration
history determines whether it becomes a hot super-Earth or the core of a giant
planet. Systems of hot super-Earths (or mini-Neptunes) form when embryos
migrate inward and pile up at the inner edge of the disk. Giant planet cores
form when inward-migrating embryos become massive enough to switch direction
and migrate outward. We present simulations of this process using a modified
N-body code, starting from a swarm of planetary embryos. Systems of hot
super-Earths form in resonant chains with the innermost planet at or interior
to the disk inner edge. Resonant chains are disrupted by late dynamical
instabilities triggered by the dispersal of the gaseous disk. Giant planet
cores migrate outward toward zero-torque zones, which move inward and
eventually disappear as the disk disperses. Giant planet cores migrate inward
with these zones and are stranded at ~1-5 AU. Our model reproduces several
properties of the observed extra-solar planet populations. The frequency of
giant planet cores increases strongly when the mass in solids is increased,
consistent with the observed giant exoplanet - stellar metallicity correlation.
The frequency of hot super-Earths is not a function of stellar metallicity,
also in agreement with observations. Our simulations can reproduce the broad
characteristics of the observed super-Earth population.

rates (SFR) and stellar masses, and this has deep implications for galaxy
formation. Here, we present a study on the evolution of the slope and scatter
of the SFR-stellar mass relation for galaxies at $3.5\leq z\leq 6.5$ using
multi-wavelength photometry in GOODS-S from the Cosmic Assembly Near-infrared
Deep Extragalactic Legacy Survey (CANDELS) and Spitzer Extended Deep Survey. We
describe an updated, Bayesian spectral-energy distribution fitting method that
incorporates effects of nebular line emission, star formation histories that
are constant or rising with time, and different dust attenuation prescriptions
(starburst and Small Magellanic Cloud). From $z$=6.5 to $z$=3.5 star-forming
galaxies in CANDELS follow a nearly unevolving correlation between stellar mass
and SFR that follows SFR $\sim$ $M_\star^a$ with $a = 0.54 \pm 0.16$ at $z\sim
6$ and $0.70 \pm 0.21$ at $z\sim 4$. This evolution requires a star formation
history that increases with decreasing redshift (on average, the SFRs of
individual galaxies rise with time). The observed scatter in the SFR-stellar
mass relation is tight, $\sigma(\log \mathrm{SFR}/\mathrm{M}_\odot$ yr$^{-1})<
0.3\ - $ 0.4 dex, for galaxies with $\log M_\star/\mathrm{M}_\odot > 9$ dex.
Assuming that the SFR is tied to the net gas inflow rate (SFR $\sim$
$\dot{M}_\mathrm{gas}$), then the scatter in the gas inflow rate is also
smaller than 0.3$-$0.4 dex for star-forming galaxies in these stellar mass and
redshift ranges, at least when averaged over the timescale of star formation.
We further show that the implied star formation history of objects selected on
the basis of their co-moving number densities is consistent with the evolution
in the SFR-stellar mass relation.

shape $\alpha$ which probes the collinear versus soft diffuse structure in the
neighborhood of the particle. The former is indicative of particles originating
from the hard scatter and the latter of particles originating from pileup
interactions. The distribution of $\alpha$ for charged pileup, assumed as a
proxy for all pileup, is used on an event-by-event basis to calculate a weight
for each particle. The weights describe the degree to which particles are
pileup-like and are used to rescale their four-momenta, superseding the need
for jet-based corrections. Furthermore, the algorithm flexibly allows
combination with other, possibly experimental, probabilistic information
associated with particles such as vertexing and timing performance. We
demonstrate the algorithm improves over existing methods by looking at jet
$p_T$ and jet mass. We also find an improvement on non-jet quantities like
missing transverse energy.

broad wavelength coverage from 370 nm to 1 micron, spread between two fiber-fed
dual-channel spectrographs, each of which can operate as an independent
instrument. The blue spectrograph, LRS2-B, covers 370-470 nm and 460-700 nm at
fixed resolving powers of ~1900 and ~1100, respectively, while the red
spectrograph, LRS2-R, covers 650-842 nm and 818-1050 nm with both of its

detailed description of the instrument's design in which we focus on the
departures from the basic VIRUS framework. The primary modifications include
the fore-optics that are used to feed the fiber integral field units at unity

dispersion may, at sufficiently small filling factors, enter into a

localised eigenstates. We investigate one of these systems - the sawtooth
lattice - filled with strongly repulsive bosons at filling factors
infinitesimally above the critical point where the crystal phase is no longer

its structure in all but one of its cells, where it is broken. The broken cell
corresponds to an exotic kind of repulsively bound state, which becomes
delocalised. We investigate the excitation spectrum of the system analytically

addition of a single particle to a flat-banded system at critical filling is

introduces quantum features in the system through the introduction of the

To obtain this result we used the fact that quantum mechanics can be understood
as a NC symplectic geometry, which generalized the standard description of
classical mechanics as a symplectic geometry. In this work, we have also
analyzed the dynamics of the model of a free particle over a 2-sphere in a NC
phase-space. Besides, we have shown the solution of the equations of motion
allows one to show the equivalence between the movement of the particle
physical degrees of freedom upon a 2-sphere and the one described by a central
field. We have considered the effective force felt by the particle as being
caused by the curvature of the space. We have analyzed the NC Poisson algebra
of classical observables in order to obtain the NC corrections to Newton's
second law. We have demonstrated precisely that the curvature of the space
acted as an effective potential for a free particle in a flat phase-space.
Besides, through NC coherent states quantization we have obtained the Green
function of the theory. The result have confirmed that we have an UV cutoff for
large momenta in the NC kernel.

describing the message count in large-scale wireless sensor networks. We focus
our attention on the popular Trickle algorithm, which has been proposed as a
suitable communication protocol for code maintenance and propagation in
wireless sensor networks. Besides providing a mathematical analysis of the
algorithm, we propose a generalized version of Trickle, with an additional
parameter defining the length of a listen-only period. This generalization
proves to be useful for optimizing the design and usage of the algorithm. For
single-cell networks we show how the message count increases with the size of
the network and how this depends on the Trickle parameters. Furthermore, we
derive distributions of inter-broadcasting times and investigate their
asymptotic behavior. Our results prove conjectures made in the literature
concerning the effect of a listen-only period. Additionally, we develop an
approximation for the expected number of transmissions in multi-cell networks.

warm coronal emissions (e.g., Fe XVI) for many minutes to a few hours after the
GOES soft X-ray peak. It was first observed by the EUV Variability Experiment
(EVE) on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO). The late phase emission
originates from a second set of longer loops (late phase loops) that are higher
than the main flaring loops. It is suggested as being caused by either
additional heating or long-lasting cooling. In this paper, we study the role of
long-lasting cooling and additional heating in producing the EUV late phase
using the ""enthalpy-based thermal evolution of loops"" (EBTEL) model. We find
that a long cooling process in late phase loops can well explain the presence
of the EUV late phase emission, but we cannot exclude the possibility of
additional heating in the decay phase. Moreover, we provide two preliminary
methods based on the UV and EUV emissions from the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly
(AIA) on board SDO to determine whether an additional heating plays some role
or not in the late phase emission. Using nonlinear force-free field modeling,
we study the magnetic configuration of the EUV late phase. It is found that the
late phase can be generated either in hot spine field lines associated with a
magnetic null point or in large-scale magnetic loops of multipolar magnetic
fields. In this paper, we also discuss why the EUV late phase is usually
observed in warm coronal emissions and why the majority of flares do not
exhibit an EUV late phase.

emission from the ATLASGAL survey. A strong correlation is seen between the
clump mass and both outflow mass and mechanical force, lending support to
models in which accretion is strongly linked to outflow. We find that the
scaling law between outflow activity and clump masses observed for low-mass
objects, is also followed by the MMAOs in this study, indicating a commonality
in the formation processes of low-mass and high-mass stars.

different boundary conditions. We start with a full comparison of the phonon
polarizations and energy dispersions as given by a fifth-nearest-neighbor
force-constant model (5NNFCM) and by elasticity theory of continuum membranes
(ETCM). For free-edges ribbons we discuss the behavior of an additional
acoustic edge-localized flexural mode, known as fourth acoustic branch (4ZA),
which has a small gap when it is obtained by the 5NNFCM. Then, we show that
ribbons with supported-edges have a sample-size dependent energy gap in the
phonon spectrum which is particularly large for in-plane modes. Irrespective to
the calculation method and the boundary condition, the dependence of the energy
gap for the low-energy optical phonon modes against the ribbon width W is found
to be proportional to 1/W for in-plane, and 1/W$^2$ for out-of-plane phonon
modes. Using the 5NNFCM, the ballistic thermal conductance and its
contributions from every single phonon mode are then obtained by the non
equilibrium Green's function technique. We found that, while edge and central
localized single atomic vacancies do not affect the low-energy transmission
function of in-plane phonon modes, they reduce considerably the contributions
of the flexural modes. On the other hand, in-plane modes contributions are
strongly dependent on the boundary conditions and at low temperatures can be
highly reduced in supported-edges samples. These findings could open a route to
engineer graphene based devices where it is possible to discriminate the
relative contribution of polarized phonons and to tune the thermal transport on
the nanoscale.

abundances in three hot Jupiters (HD 189733b, HD 209458b, and WASP-12b),
spanning a wide temperature range (1200-2500 K), using their near-infrared
transmission spectra obtained using the HST WFC3 instrument. We report
conclusive measurements of H2O in HD 189733b and HD 209458b, while that in
WASP-12b is not well constrained by present data. The data allow nearly solar
as well as significantly sub-solar abundances in HD 189733b and WASP-12b.
However, for HD 209458b, we report the most precise H2O measurement in an
exoplanet to date that suggests a ~20-135 sub-solar H2O abundance. We discuss
the implications of our results on the formation conditions of hot Jupiters and
on the likelihood of clouds in their atmospheres. Our results highlight the

coating two non-touching sliding bodies with ferromagnetic films. The resulting

feature that neighboring field lines exponentiate away from each other and
become stochastic, hence the ideal constraint of preserving magnetic field line
connectivity becomes exponentially sensitive to small deviations from ideal
Ohm's law. The idea of breaking field line connectivity by stochasticity as a
mechanism for fast reconnection is tested with numerical simulations based on
reduced magnetohydrodynamics equations with a strong guide field line-tied to
two perfectly conducting end plates. Starting from an ideally stable force-free
equilibrium, the system is allowed to undergo resistive relaxation. Two
distinct phases are found in the process of resistive relaxation. During the
quasi-static phase, rapid change of field line connectivity and strong induced
flow are found in regions of high field line exponentiation. However, although
the field line connectivity of individual field lines can change rapidly, the
overall pattern of field line mapping appears to deform gradually. From this
perspective, field line exponentiation appears to cause enhanced diffusion
rather than reconnection. In some cases, resistive quasi-static evolution can
cause the ideally stable initial equilibrium to cross a stability threshold,
leading to formation of intense current filaments and rapid change of field
line mapping into a qualitatively different pattern. It is in this onset phase
that the change of field line connectivity is more appropriately designated as
magnetic reconnection. Our results show that rapid change of field line
connectivity appears to be a necessary, but not a sufficient condition for fast
reconnection.

inner product of a vector of phases with a binary ""selector"" vector, where the
arithmetic is done modulo 2pi and the result is encoded in the phase of a
coherent field. This circuit, a collection of cascaded interferometers driven
by a coherent input field, demonstrates the use of coherence as a computational
resource, and of the use of recently-developed mathematical tools for modeling
optical circuits with many coupled parts. The construction extends in a
straightforward way to the computation of matrix-vector and matrix-matrix
products, and, with the inclusion of an optical feedback loop, to the
computation of a ""weighted"" readout of stored memory phases. We note some
applications of these circuits for error correction and for computing tasks

understanding of animal behavior, social interactions, and many important
ecological and epidemiological processes. However, most of the studies are at
low temporal and spatial resolution due to the difficulty in recording accurate
contact information. Domestic animals such as cattle have social behavior and
serve as an excellent study system because their position can be explicitly and
continuously tracked, allowing their social networks to be accurately
constructed. We used radio-frequency tags to accurately track cattle position
and analyze high-resolution cattle social networks. We tested the hypothesis of
temporal stationarity and spatial homogeneity in these high-resolution networks
and demonstrated substantial spatial-temporal heterogeneity during different
daily time periods (feeding and non-feeding) and in different areas of the pen
(grain bunk, water trough, hay bunk, and other general pen area). The social
network structure is analyzed using global network characteristics (network
density, exponential random graph model structure), subgroup clustering
(modularity), triadic property (transitivity), and dyadic interactions
(correlation coefficient from a quadratic assignment procedure). Cattle tend to
have the strongest and most consistent contacts with others around the hay bunk
during the feeding time. These results cannot be determined from data at lower
spatial (aggregated at entire pen level) or temporal (aggregated at daily
level) resolution. These results reveal new insights for real-time animal
social network structure dynamics, providing more accurate descriptions that
allow more accurate modeling of multiple (both direct and indirect) disease
transmission pathways.

distinctive resources of quantum mechanics such as entanglement. It has been
shown that the precision of estimating an overall multiplicative factor of a
Hamiltonian can be increased to exceed the classical limit, yet little is known
about estimating a general Hamiltonian parameter. In this paper, we study this
problem in detail. We find that the scaling of the estimation precision with
the number of systems can always be optimized to the Heisenberg limit, while
the time scaling can be quite different from that of estimating an overall
multiplicative factor. We derive the generator of local parameter translation
on the unitary evolution operator of the Hamiltonian, and use it to evaluate
the estimation precision of the parameter and establish a general upper bound
on the quantum Fisher information. The results indicate that the quantum Fisher
information generally can be divided into two parts: one is quadratic in time,
while the other oscillates with time. When the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian
do not depend on the parameter, the quadratic term vanishes, and the quantum
Fisher information will be bounded in this case. To illustrate the results, we
give an example of estimating a parameter of a magnetic field by measuring a
spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ particle, and compare the results for estimating the
amplitude and the direction of the magnetic field.

especially at optical and longer wavelengths: further improvements of the
predictions for the blue and ultraviolet spectral regions await the use of
hydrodynamic models where the microturbulent velocity is not treated as a free
parameter. We show how the morphology of the colour-magnitude diagram (CMD)
changes for different values of [Fe/H] and [alpha/Fe]; in particular, how
suitable colour combinations can easily discriminate between red giant branch
and lower main sequence populations with different [alpha/Fe], due to the
concomitant loops and swings in the CMD. We also provide computer programs to
produce tables of synthetic bolometric corrections as well as routines to
interpolate in them. These colour-Teff-metallicity relations may be used to
convert isochrones for different chemical compositions to various bandpasses
assuming observed reddening values, thus bypassing the standard assumption of a
constant colour excess for stars of different spectral type. We also show how
such an assumption can lead to significant systematic errors. The MARCS
transformations presented in this study promise to provide important
constraints on our understanding of the multiple stellar populations found in
globular clusters (e.g., the colours of lower main sequence stars are predicted

retrieval (CIR) is a critical technique for these search engines to facilitate

  This paper proposes an alternative framework for contextual information

concept of the epigenetic landscape. Recently researchers developed the
quasi-potential theory to represent the Waddington's landscape. The
Quasi-potential U(x), derived from interactions in the gene regulatory network
(GRN) of a cell, quantifies the relative stability of network states, which
determine the effort required for state transitions in a multi-stable dynamical
system. However, quasi-potential landscapes, originally developed for
continuous systems, are not suitable for discrete-valued networks which are
important tools to study complex systems. In this paper, we provide a framework
to quantify the landscape for discrete Boolean networks (BNs). We apply our
framework to study pancreas cell differentiation where an ensemble of BN models
is considered based on the structure of a minimal GRN for pancreas development.
We impose biologically motivated structural constraints (corresponding to
specific type of Boolean functions) and dynamical constraints (corresponding to
stable attractor states) to limit the space of BN models for pancreas
development. In addition, we enforce a novel functional constraint
corresponding to the relative ordering of attractor states in BN models to
restrict the space of BN models to the biological relevant class. We find that
BNs with canalyzing/sign-compatible Boolean functions best capture the dynamics
of pancreas cell differentiation. This framework can also determine the genes'
influence on cell state transitions, and thus can facilitate the rational
design of cell reprogramming protocols.

decomposition (PSD) with symplectic Galerkin projection, is proposed to save
the computational cost for the simplification of large-scale Hamiltonian
systems while preserving the symplectic structure. As an analogy to the
classical proper orthogonal decomposition (POD)-Galerkin approach, PSD is
designed to build a symplectic subspace to fit empirical data, while the
symplectic Galerkin projection constructs a reduced Hamiltonian system on the
symplectic subspace. For practical use, we introduce three algorithms for PSD,
which are based upon: the cotangent lift, complex singular value decomposition,
and nonlinear programming. The proposed technique has been proven to preserve
system energy and stability. Moreover, PSD can be combined with the discrete
empirical interpolation method to reduce the computational cost for nonlinear
Hamiltonian systems. Owing to these properties, the proposed technique is
better suited than the classical POD-Galerkin approach for model reduction of
Hamiltonian systems, especially when long-time integration is required. The
stability, accuracy, and efficiency of the proposed technique are illustrated
through numerical simulations of linear and nonlinear wave equations.

data structures. The state-of-the-art methods are limited to the
unfold-and-match (U+M) paradigm, where predicates are transformed via
(un)folding operations induced from their definitions before being treated as
uninterpreted. However, proof obligations from verifying programs with
iterative loops and multiple function calls often do not succumb to this
paradigm. Our contribution is a proof method which -- beyond U+M -- performs
automatic formula re-writing by treating previously encountered obligations in
each proof path as possible induction hypotheses. This enables us, for the
first time, to systematically reason about a wide range of obligations, arising
from practical program verification. We demonstrate the power of our proof
rules on commonly used lemmas, thereby close the remaining gaps in existing
state-of-the-art systems. Another impact, probably more important, is that our
method regains the power of compositional reasoning, and shows that the usage
of user-provided lemmas is no longer needed for the existing set of benchmarks.
This not only removes the burden of coming up with the appropriate lemmas, but
also significantly boosts up the verification process, since lemma
applications, coupled with unfolding, often induce very large search space.

trees, paths, and matchings, but the problem addresses the subgraph
enumeration, such as enumeration of subgraphs that are trees. Their induced
subgraph versions have not been studied well. One of few example is for
chordless paths and cycles. Our motivation is to reduce the time complexity
close to O(1) for each solution. This type of optimal algorithms are proposed
many subgraph classes such as trees, and spanning trees. Induced subtrees are
fundamental object thus it should be studied deeply and there possibly exist
some efficient algorithms. Our algorithm utilizes nice properties of

complexity is reduced to O(k) time per induced subtree. The problem is solved

simulation matches the number of observed families as well. We used new
observational data from the WISE satellite (Masiero et al., 2011) to construct
the observed SFDs. We simulate mutual collisions of asteroids with a modified
version of the Boulder code (Morbidelli et al., 2009), where the results of

breakups, we created two models - for monolithic asteroids and for
rubble-piles. To explain the observed SFDs in the size range D = 1 to 10 km we
have to also account for dynamical depletion due to the Yarkovsky effect. The
assumption of (purely) rubble-pile asteroids leads to a significantly worse fit

further SPH simulations of disruptions of smaller targets (with a parent body

to a wireless infostation terminal which stores high data-rate content in its
cache memory. Cellular users in the vicinity of the infostation can directly
download the stored content from the infostation through a broadband connection
(e.g., WiFi), reducing the latency and load on the cellular network. The goal
of the infostation cache controller (CC) is to store the most popular content
in the cache memory such that the maximum amount of traffic is offloaded to the
infostation. In practice, the popularity profile of the files is not known by
the CC, which observes only the instantaneous demands for those contents stored
in the cache. Hence, the cache content placement is optimised based on the
demand history and on the cost associated to placing each content in the cache.
By refreshing the cache content at regular time intervals, the CC gradually
learns the popularity profile, while at the same time exploiting the limited
cache capacity in the best way possible. This is formulated as a multi-armed
bandit (MAB) problem with switching cost. Several algorithms are presented to
decide on the cache content over time. The performance is measured in terms of
cache efficiency, defined as the amount of net traffic that is offloaded to the
infostation. In addition to theoretical regret bounds, the proposed algorithms
are analysed through numerical simulations. In particular, the impact of system
parameters, such as the number of files, number of users, cache size, and
skewness of the popularity profile, on the performance is studied numerically.
It is shown that the proposed algorithms learn the popularity profile quickly
for a wide range of system parameters.

needed to help or confirm the asteroseismic analysis of these objects. Another
important aspect is the new class of white dwarfs - the hot DQ - detected by
Dufour et al. (2007), with spectra dominated by carbon lines. The analysis
shows that their atmospheres are pure carbon. The origin of these stars is not

element abundances and study the implications for the evolution white dwarfs of

explanations for this unusual composition, which have been proposed in the

levitation, carbon dredge-up from deeper interior below the helium layer, and a
residual stellar wind. None of these explanations is completely satisfactory,

magnetic materials, we theoretically investigate effects of magnetoelastic
coupling in geometrically frustrated classical spin models. In particular, we
consider bond-disordered Heisenberg antiferromagnets on a pyrochlore lattice
coupled to local lattice distortions. By integrating out the lattice degree of
freedom, we derive an effective spin-only model, the bilinear-biquadratic model
with bond disorder, which is analyzed by classical Monte Carlo simulations.
First, we discuss the phase diagrams as well as thermodynamic and magnetic
properties. We show that the spin-glass transition temperature is largely
enhanced by the spin-lattice coupling $b$ in the weakly disordered regime. This
enhancement is ascribed to the suppression of thermal fluctuations in
semidiscrete degenerate manifold formed in the presence of the spin-lattice
coupling. We also find that, as increasing the strength of disorder, the system
shows a concomitant transition of the nematic order and spin glass at a
temperature determined by $b$, being almost independent of bond disorder.
Although further-neighbor exchange interactions originating in the cooperative
lattice distortions result in the spin-lattice order in the weakly disordered
regime, the concomitant transition remains robust. We investigate the nature of
the concomitant transition by analyzing the hysteresis of the magnetic
susceptibility, the nonlinear susceptibility, and the specific heat.
Furthermore, we discuss linear and nonlinear magnetic susceptibilities in the
high-temperature paramagnetic phase as well as single-spin flip dynamics in the
nematic phase. All these results are discussed in comparison with experiments
for typical pyrochlore magnets, such as Y2Mo2O7 and ZnCr2O4.

$L_{\rm p}\propto E_{\rm p}^{2.13^{+0.54}_{-0.46}}$. Both FSRQs and LBLs are
clustered in the low-$E_{\rm p}$, low-$L_{\rm p}$ corner. IBLs and HBLs have
$E_{\rm s}\sim 2\times 10^{-3} - 10^{2}$ keV and $L_{\rm s} \sim 10^{44} -

explained with the synchrotron radiation of fast-cooling electrons in a highly
magnetized ejecta, and the weak anti-correlation of $L_{\rm s}-E_{\rm s}$ for
FSRQs and LBLs may be attributed to synchrotron radiation of slow-cooling
electrons in a moderately magnetized ejecta. The distributions of IBLs and HBLs
in the $L_{\rm p}-E_{\rm p}$ plane may be interpreted with synchrotron
radiation of fast-cooling electrons in a matter-dominated ejecta. These results

of identical rough particles may reach hydrodynamic states (also called
\textit{normal} states), even if energy is not conserved in particle
collisions. As a way to measure the ability of the system to present a
hydrodynamic behavior, we focus on the so-called homogeneous cooling state of
the granular gas and look at the corresponding relaxation time as a function of
inelasticity and roughness. We report computer simulation results of the sixth-
and eighth-order cumulants of the particle velocity distribution function and
study the influence of roughness on their relaxation times and asymptotic
values. This extends the results of a previous work [Phys. Rev. E \textbf{89},
020202(R) (2014], where lower-order cumulants were measured. Our results
confirm that the relaxation times are not necessarily longer for stronger
inelasticities. This implies that inelasticity by itself does not preclude
hydrodynamics.
  It is also observed that the cumulants associated with the angular velocity
distribution may reach very high values in a certain region of (small)

inflation is particularly simple in the ""new minimal"" formalism of
supergravity, where the inflaton has no scalar superpartners. This paper is
devoted to matter couplings in such supergravity models. We show how in the new
minimal formalism matter coupling presents certain features absent in other
formalisms. In particular, for the large class of matter couplings considered
in this paper, matter must possess an R-symmetry, which is gauged by the vector
field which becomes dynamical in the ""new minimal"" completion of the $R+\alpha
R^2$ theory. Thus, in the dual formulation of the theory, where the gauge
vector is part of a massive vector multiplet, the inflaton is the superpartner
of the massive vector of a nonlinearly realized R-symmetry. The F-term
potential of this theory is of no-scale type, while the inflaton potential is
given by the D-term of the gauged R-symmetry. The absolute minimum of the
potential is always exactly supersymmetric, so in this class of models if
realistic vacua exist, they must be always metastable. We also briefly comment
on possible generalizations of the examples discussed here and we exhibit some
features of higher-curvature supergravity coupled to matter in the ""old

defined by the concepts of invariants and polymorphisms similar to the classic
constraint satisfaction approach. These concepts are adapted in two ways.
Firstly, the correspondence of ""invariant-polymorphism"" is generalized to
(min,max) semirings. Secondly, we consider non-uniform polymorphisms, where
each variable has its own operator, in contrast to the case of one operator
common for all variables. The article describes an algorithm that finds $d$
most admissible solutions in polynomial time, provided that the problem is
invariant with respect to some non-uniform majority operator. It is essential
that this operator needs not to be known for the algorithm to work. Moreover,
even a guarantee for the existence of such an operator is not necessary. The
algorithm either finds the solution or discards the problem. The latter is
possible only if the problem has no majority polymorphism.

industry, and are different from ordinary fluids or solids, with unusual,
interesting static and flow properties. The transition from fluid to solid -at
the so-called jamming density- features a multitude of complex mechanisms, but
there is no unified theoretical framework that explains them all. In this
study, a simple yet quantitative and predictive model is presented, which
allows for a variable, changing jamming density, encompassing the memory of the
deformation history and explaining a multitude of phenomena at and around
jamming. The jamming density, now introduced as a new state-variable, changes
due to the deformation history and relates the system's macroscopic response to
its microstructure. The packing efficiency can increase logarithmically slow
under gentle repeated (isotropic) compression, leading to an increase of the
jamming density. In contrast, shear deformations cause anisotropy, changing the
packing efficiency exponentially fast with either dilatancy or compactancy. The
memory of the system near jamming can be explained by a microstatistical model
that involves a multiscale, fractal energy landscape and links the microscopic
particle picture to the macroscopic continuum description, providing a unified
explanation for the qualitatively different flow-behavior for different
deformation modes. To complement our work, a recipe to extract the
history-dependent jamming density from experimentally accessible data is
proposed, and alternative state-variables are compared. The proposed simple
macroscopic constitutive model is calibrated with the memory of microstructure.
Such approach can help understanding predicting and mitigating failure of
structures or geophysical hazards, and will bring forward industrial process
design/optimization, and help solving scientific challenges in fundamental

degenerate heavy neutrino mass spectrum. Consequently, such scheme, produces
vanishing one light neutrino mass squared difference and lepton asymmetry. To
circumvent such unphysical outcome, we break cyclic symmetry in the diagonal
right chiral neutrino mass term by a small breaking parameter. Nonzero mass
squared differences and mixing angles are generated with the help of the small
breaking parameter. Smallness of the breaking parameter opens up a possibility
of resonant leptogenesis. Assuming complex Yukawa couplings, we derive
generalized expressions flavor dependent CP asymmetry parameters

chain of coupled Boltzmann equations (which are flavor dependent too) which
have to be solved in order to get the final lepton asymmetries. Depending upon
the temperature regime the CP asymmetries and the Boltzmann equations may also
be flavor independent. As our goal is to study the enhancement of CP asymmetry
due to quasi degeneracy of right handed neutrinos, we select only the lowest
allowed (by neutrino oscillation data) value of breaking parameter (and other

instance considering the horizontal eroded area at the cliff top and the
maximum local retreat of the coastline. Field studies suggest that, for large
failures, the frequencies of these two quantities decrease as power laws of the
respective magnitudes, defining two different decay exponents. Moreover, the
horizontal area increases as a power law of the maximum local retreat,
identifying a third exponent. Such observation suggests that the geometry of
cliff failures are statistically similar for different magnitudes. Power laws
are familiar in the physics of critical systems. The corresponding exponents
satisfy precise relations and are proven to be universal features, common to
very different systems. Following the approach typical of statistical physics,
we propose a ""scaling hypothesis"" resulting in a relation between the three
above exponents: there is a precise, mathematical relation between the
distributions of magnitudes of erosion events and their geometry. Beyond its
theoretical value, such relation could be useful for the validation of field
catalogs analysis. Pushing the statistical physics approach further, we develop
a numerical model of marine erosion that reproduces the observed failure
statistics. Despite the minimality of the model, the exponents resulting from
extensive numerical simulations fairly agree with those measured on the field.

behind our simple model, can possibly be used as a guide to decipher the

transport spin polarization, such calculations also indicate that the Sb-Fe-Sb

previous paper further by studying some new aspects of the considered models

most acceptable cosmological results. Our investigations are performed by
applying the dynamical system approach. We obtain the cosmological
parameters/quantities in terms of some defined dimensionless parameters that
are used in constructing the dynamical equations of motion. The investigated
parameters/quantities are the evolution of the Hubble parameter and its
inverse, the ""weight function"", the ratio of the matter density to the dark
energy density and its time variation, the deceleration, the jerk and the snap
parameters, and the equation-of-state parameter of the dark energy. We
numerically examine these quantities for two general models $R+\alpha
R^{-n}+\sqrt{-T}$ and $R\log{[\alpha R]}^{q}+\sqrt{-T}$. All considered models
have some inconsistent quantities (with respect to the available observational
data), except the model with n=-0.9 which has more consistent quantities than
the other ones. By considering the ratio of the matter density to the dark
energy density, we find that the coincidence problem does~not refer to a unique
cosmological event, rather, this coincidence also occurred in the early
universe. We also present the cosmological solutions for an interesting model
$R+c_{1}\sqrt{-T}$ in the non--flat FLRW metric. We show that this model has an
attractor solution for the late times, though with $w^{(\textrm{DE})}=-1/2$.
This model indicates that the spatial curvature density parameter gets
negligible values until the present era, in which it acquires the values of the
order $10^{-4}$ or $10^{-3}$. As the second part of this work, we consider the

relax is about $3\tau_p = 3/{(k_f +k_{nr})\log_{10}e}$, where $k_f +k_{nr}$ is
the total emission rate. To arrive at this expression we assumed that, the

be understood in terms of their broader X-ray and optical properties and leads
to a division of this sub-sample into two groups. A little more than half are
likely to be narrow-line Seyfert 1s (NLS1s), so misclassified because of the
contribution of the Broad Line Region (BLR) to their optical spectra. The
remainder have some of the properties of Seyfert 2 (Sy2) AGN; their optical
elusiveness can be explained by optical dilution from the host galaxy plus a
star-formation contribution and by their underluminous optical emission due to
low accretion rates. Because some of the Sy2 sources have very low accretion
rates, are unabsorbed, plus the fact that they lack broad optical emission
lines, they are good candidates to be True Sy2 AGN.

have been characterized by measurements on single crystals. EuMnBi2 is
isostructural with the Dirac material SrMnBi2 based on single crystal x-ray
diffraction, crystallizing in the I4/mmm space group (No. 139). Magnetic
susceptibility measurements suggest antiferromagnetic (AFM) ordering of moments
on divalent Eu ions near T_N=22K. For low fields, the ordered Eu moments are
aligned along the c-axis, and a spin-flop is observed near 5.4T at 5K. The
moment is not saturated in an applied field of 13T at 5K, which is uncommon for
compounds containing Eu^{2+}. The magnetic behavior suggests an anisotropy
enhancement via interaction between Eu and the Mn moments that appear to be
order antiferromagnetically below approximately 310K. A large increase in the
magnetoresistance is observed across the spin-flop, with absolute
magnetoresistance reaching approximately 650% at 5K and 12T. Hall effect
measurements reveal a decrease in the carrier density below T_N, which implies
a manipulation of the Fermi surface by magnetism on the sites surrounding the
Bi square nets that lead to Dirac cones in this family of materials.

The results of simulation and experiment indicate the great advantages of PAA

  Differential Equations","41 pages, 1 figure",,,,"math.NA math.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A recurring theme in attempts to break the curse of dimensionality in the
numerical approximations of solutions to high-dimensional partial differential
equations (PDEs) is to employ some form of sparse tensor approximation.
Unfortunately, there are only a few results that quantify the possible
advantages of such an approach. This paper introduces a class $\Sigma_n$ of
functions, which can be written as a sum of rank-one tensors using a total of
at most $n$ parameters and then uses this notion of sparsity to prove a
regularity theorem for certain high-dimensional elliptic PDEs. It is shown,
among other results, that whenever the right-hand side $f$ of the elliptic PDE
can be approximated with a certain rate $\mathcal{O}(n^{-r})$ in the norm of
${\mathrm H}^{-1}$ by elements of $\Sigma_n$, then the solution $u$ can be
approximated in ${\mathrm H}^1$ from $\Sigma_n$ to accuracy
$\mathcal{O}(n^{-r'})$ for any $r'\in (0,r)$. Since these results require
knowledge of the eigenbasis of the elliptic operator considered, we propose a
second ""basis-free"" model of tensor sparsity and prove a regularity theorem for
this second sparsity model as well. We then proceed to address the important
question of the extent such regularity theorems translate into results on
computational complexity. It is shown how this second model can be used to
derive computational algorithms with performance that breaks the curse of
dimensionality on certain model high-dimensional elliptic PDEs with
tensor-sparse data.

model suggests that the fat tail property of damage can be determined either by
that of disaster or by those of population/property depending on which tail is
fatter. It is also found that the spatial correlations of population/property
can enhance or reduce the variance of damage depending on how fat the tails of
population/property are. In case of tornadoes in the United States, we show
that the damage does have fat tail property. Our results support that the

established intrinsic colours, effective temperatures, and bolometric
corrections for pre-main sequence (PMS) stars, we re-address the theory of
accretion-disc regulated stellar angular momentum (AM) evolution. We report on
the compilation of a consistent sample of fully convective stars within two of
the most well-studied and youngest, nearby regions of star formation: the Orion
Nebula Cluster (ONC) and Taurus-Auriga. We calculate the average specific
stellar AM ($j_{\star}$) assuming solid body rotation, using surface rotation
periods gathered from the literature and new estimates of stellar radii and
ages. We use published Spitzer IRAC fluxes to classify our stars as Class II or
Class III and compare their $j_{\star}$ evolution. Our results suggest that
disc dispersal is a rapid process that occurs at a variety of ages. We find a
consistent $j_{\star}$ reduction rate between the Class II and Class III PMS
stars which we interpret as indicating a period of accretion disc-regulated AM
evolution followed by near-constant AM evolution once the disc has dissipated.
Furthermore, assuming our observed spread in stellar ages is real, we find the
removal rate of $j_{\star}$ during the Class II phase is more rapid than
expected by contraction at constant stellar rotation rate. A much more
efficient process of AM removal must exist, most likely in the form of an
accretion-driven stellar wind or other outflow from the star-disc interaction
region or extended disc surface.

multiple channels, each associated with a different orbital. Their unambiguous
assignment remains a major challenge for high-harmonic spectroscopy. Here we
present a multi-modal approach, using unaligned SF$_6$ molecules as an example,
where we combine methods from extreme-ultraviolet spectroscopy, above-threshold
ionization and attosecond metrology. Channel-resolved above-threshold
ionization measurements reveal that strong-field ionization opens four
channels. Two of them, identified by monitoring the ellipticity dependence of
the high-harmonic emission, are found to dominate the harmonic signal. A switch
from the HOMO-3 to the HOMO-1 channel at 26 eV is confirmed by a phase jump in
the harmonic emission, and by the differing dynamical responses to molecular
vibrations. This study demonstrates a modus operandi for extending
high-harmonic spectroscopy to polyatomic molecules, where complex attosecond
dynamics are expected.

is an ideal laboratory for studying the interplay of infall, outflow, and
rotation in the earliest stages of low-mass star formation. Aims: We wish to
exploit the unmatched combination of high angular resolution, high sensitivity,
high-imaging fidelity, and spectral coverage provided by ALMA to shed light on
the complex kinematics of the innermost central regions of HH212. Methods: We
mapped the inner 10"" (4500 AU) of the HH212 system at about 0.5 arcsec
resolution in several molecular tracers and in the 850 $\mu$m dust continuum
using the ALMA interferometer in band 7 in the extended configuration of the
Early Science Cycle 0 operations. Results: Within a single ALMA spectral
set-up, we simultaneously identify all the crucial ingredients known to be
involved in the star formation recipe namely: (i) the fast, collimated bipolar
SiO jet driven by the protostar, (ii) the large-scale swept-up CO outflow,
(iii) the flattened rotating and infalling envelope, with bipolar cavities
carved by the outflow (in C$^{17}$O(3--2)), and (iv) a rotating wide-angle flow
that fills the cavities and surrounding the axial jet (in C$^{34}$S(7--6)). In
addition, the compact high-velocity C$^{17}$O emission ($\pm$ 1.9--3.5 km
s$^{-1}$ from systemic) shows a velocity gradient along the equatorial plane
consistent with a rotating disk of about 0.2 arcsec = 90 AU around a $\simeq
0.3 \pm 0.1 M_{\rm \odot}$ source. The rotating disk is possibly Keplerian.
Conclusions: HH212 is the third Class 0 protostar with possible signatures of a
Keplerian disk of radius $\geq 30 AU$. The warped geometry in our CS data
suggests that this large keplerian disk might result from misaligned magnetic
and rotation axes during the collapse phase. The wide-angle CS flow suggests
that disk winds may be present in this source.

in the island state this trend holds only when the bursts are less luminous and

hierarchical model which captures dynamic frequency changes via a shrinkage
model applied to wavelet basis functions. Wavelets are known for capturing data
features at different temporal scales; we use a recently-proposed shrinkage
prior from the factor analysis literature so that features at the finest levels
of detail exhibit the greatest shrinkage. Rather than using a multinomial
distribution for monitoring the changes in discards over time, which can be
slow to fit and inflexible, we use a nested zero-and-N inflated (ZaNI) binomial
distribution which enables much faster computation with no obvious
deterioration in model flexibility. Our results show that seasonal behaviour in
these data are not regular and occur at different frequencies. We also show
that the nested ZaNI binomial distribution is a good fit to multinomial count

tracking-by-detection. Current min-cost flow algorithms which solve the data
association problem optimally have three main drawbacks: they are
computationally expensive, they assume that the whole video is given as a

video sequence. In this paper, we address each of these issues, resulting in a
computationally and memory-bounded solution. First, we introduce a dynamic
version of the successive shortest-path algorithm which solves the data
association problem optimally while reusing computation, resulting in
significantly faster inference than standard solvers. Second, we address the
optimal solution to the data association problem when dealing with an incoming
stream of data (i.e., online setting). Finally, we present our main
contribution which is an approximate online solution with bounded memory and
computation which is capable of handling videos of arbitrarily length while
performing tracking in real time. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our
algorithms on the KITTI and PETS2009 benchmarks and show state-of-the-art

effect and dielectric spectroscopy. At room temperature the Hall coefficient is
positive and close to the value expected from stoichiometry; the temperature
behavior follows the dc resistivity $\rho(T)$. Within the planes the dc
conductivity is well described by variable-range hopping in two dimensions;
this model, however, fails for the out-of-plane direction. An unusually broad
in-plane dielectric relaxation is detected below about 60 K; it slows down much
faster than the dc conductivity following an Arrhenius law. At around 17 K we
can identify a pronounced dielectric anomaly concomitantly with anomalous
features in the mean relaxation time and spectral broadening. The out-of-plane
relaxation, on the other hand, shows a much weaker dielectric anomaly; it
closely follows the temperature behavior of the respective dc resistivity. At
lower temperatures, the dielectric constant becomes smaller both within and
perpendicular to the planes; also the relaxation levels off. The observed
behavior bears features of relaxor-like ferroelectricity. Because
heterogeneities impede its long-range development, only a weak tunneling-like
dynamics persists at low temperatures. We suggest that the random potential and
domain structure gradually emerge due to the coupling to the anion network.

extracted from the CDF calculations. The estimated half-lives are found in good
agreement with the experimental values, which not only confirms the validity of
the CDF theory in describing the proton-rich nuclei, but also indicates the
prediction power of present approach to calculate the half-lives and in turn to
extract the structural information of proton emitters.

simulations, where the lateral positions are fixed to a 2D lattice, while the
rotational degrees of freedom are continuous. We use these simulations to
investigate orientational ordering in the condensed state. We reproduce various
experimentally observed features such as the alignment of individual molecules

low packet transmission delay. The proposed MAC scheme can also address the

ferromagnetic insulator EuS film stacked on top of Bi$_2$Se$_3$(111) slabs of
three or five quintuple layers (QLs) with the magnetization of EuS normal to
the interface ($z$ axis), which breaks both time-reversal and inversion
symmetry. It is found that a charge transfer and surface relaxation makes the
Dirac cones electron-doped. For both 3 and 5 QLs, the top-surface Dirac cone
has an energy gap of 9 meV, while the bottom surface Dirac cone remains
gapless. This feature is due to the short-ranged induced magnetic moment of the
EuS film. For the 5 QLs, an additional Dirac cone with an energy gap of 2 meV
is formed right below the bottom-surface Dirac point, while for 3 QLs, there is
no additional Dirac cone. We also examine the spin-orbital texture of the Dirac
surface states with broken inversion symmetry, using DFT and the effective
model. We find that the $p_z$ orbital is coupled to the $z$ component of the
spin moment in the opposite sign to the $p_x$ and $p_y$ orbitals. The $p_z$ and
radial $p$ orbitals are coupled to the in-plane spin texture in the opposite
handedness to the tangential $p$ orbital. The result obtained from the

extensive tests of the method and find that in most of the cases it is able to
uncover non-negligible magnetic field decay (more than a few tens of per cent
during the studied range of ages) in normal radio pulsars for realistic initial
properties of neutron stars. However, precise determination of the magnetic
field decay timescale is not possible at present. The estimated timescale may
differ by a factor of few for different sets of initial distributions of
neutron star parameters. In addition, some combinations of initial
distributions and/or selection effects can also mimic enhanced field decay. We
apply our method to the observed sample of radio pulsars at distances $<10$ kpc
in the range of characteristic ages $8 \times 10^4 < \tau < 10^6$ years where,
according to our study, selection effects are minimized. By analysing pulsars

characterized using the Fermi Large Area Telescope, enabling improved
understanding of the emission regions within the neutron star magnetospheres,
and the contributions of pulsars to high energy electrons and diffuse gamma
rays in the Milky Way. The first gamma-ray pulsars to be detected were the most
intense and/or those with narrow pulses. Aims: As the Fermi mission progresses,
progressively fainter objects can be studied. In addition to more distant
pulsars (thus probing a larger volume of the Galaxy), or ones in high
background regions (thus improving the sampling uniformity across the Galactic
plane), we detect pulsars with broader pulses or lower luminosity. Adding
pulsars to our catalog with inclination angles that are rare in the observed
sample, and/or with lower spindown power, will reduce the bias in the currently
known gamma-ray pulsar population. Methods: We use rotation ephemerides derived
from radio observations to phase-fold gamma rays recorded by the Fermi Large
Area Telescope, to then determine the pulse profile properties. Spectral
analysis provides the luminosities and, when the signal-to-noise ratio allows,
the cutoff energies. We constrain the pulsar distances by different means in
order to minimize the luminosity uncertainties. Results: We present six new
gamma-ray pulsars with an eclectic mix of properties. Three are young, and
three are recycled. They include the farthest, the lowest power, two of the
highest duty-cycle pulsars seen, and only the fourth young gamma-ray pulsar
with a radio interpulse. We discuss the biases existing in the current

E 94, 013302 (2016)","10.1103/PhysRevE.94.013302",,"physics.atom-ph physics.chem-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The use of Slater-type spinor orbitals in algebraic solution of the Dirac
equation is investigated. The one- and two-center integrals constitute the
matrix elements arising in generalized eigenvalue equation for one-electron
atoms and molecules are evaluated over Slater-type spinor orbitals via
ellipsoidal coordinates. These integrals are calculated through numerical
global-adaptive method with Gauss-Kronrod numerical integration extension. The
calculations are performed for electronic structure of ground and excited
states of one-electron atoms and diatomic molecules. The screening constants
are allowed to be variationally optimum values for given nuclear separation.
The obtained results are compaired with the results those found in the
literature. The procedures discussed in this work are capable of yielding
highly accurate relativistic two-center one-electron integrals for all ranges
of orbital parameters. Besides provides an efficient way to overcome the
problems that arise in relativistic calculations.

cosmic microwave background radiation. During its eleven day science flight in
the Austral Summer of 2012, it operated 955 spider-web transition edge sensor
(TES) bolometers separated into bands at 150, 250 and 410 GHz. This is the
first time that an array of TES bolometers has been used on a balloon platform
to conduct science observations. Polarization sensitivity was provided by a
wire grid and continuously rotating half-wave plate. The balloon implementation
of the bolometer array and readout electronics presented unique development
requirements. Here we present an outline of the readout system, the remote
tuning of the bolometers and Superconducting QUantum Interference Device
(SQUID) amplifiers, and preliminary current noise of the bolometer array and
readout system.

which is an improved version of SynC algorithm. In order to decrease the time
complexity of the original SynC algorithm, we combine grid cell partitioning
method and Red-Black tree to construct the near neighbor point set of every
point. By simulated experiments of some artificial data sets and several real
data sets, we observe that FSynC algorithm can often get less time than SynC
algorithm for many kinds of data sets. At last, it gives some research
expectations to popularize this algorithm.

  neutrinos in a rotating electromagnetic field","4 pages, 0 figures",,,,"quant-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The problem of Dirac's equation in a rotating electromagnetic field can be
reduced to the stationary by using a transformation for point rotating
reference frames. The general form of the non-Galilean transformation is
deduced in the paper. For the non-Galilean transformation time is different in
the rotating and resting frame. This transformation contains a constant, with
the dimension of time. The constant is assumed to be fundamental. The
transformation forms the necessary condition for the existence of periodic,
bounded and square integrable solutions in both the rotating and resting frame.
Variety of such solutions exists. Among the solutions massless states are
identified. They describe localized neutrinos with invariable spin. The states
in the resting frame are not stationary but they have a good chance to be
stable.
