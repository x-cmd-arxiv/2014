structure and the organization of criminal networks is of fundamental
importance for both the investigations and the development of efficient
strategies to prevent and restrain crimes. Intelligence agencies exploit
information obtained from the analysis of large amounts of heterogeneous data
deriving from various informative sources including the records of phone
traffic, the social networks, surveillance data, interview data, experiential
police data, and police intelligence files, to acquire knowledge about criminal
networks and initiate accurate and destabilizing actions. In this context,
visual representation techniques coordinate the exploration of the structure of
the network together with the metrics of social network analysis. Nevertheless,
the utility of visualization tools may become limited when the dimension and
the complexity of the system under analysis grow beyond certain terms. In this
paper we show how we employ some interactive visualization techniques to
represent criminal and terrorist networks reconstructed from phone traffic
data, namely foci, fisheye and geo-mapping network layouts. These methods allow
the exploration of the network through animated transitions among visualization
models and local enlargement techniques in order to improve the comprehension
of interesting areas. By combining the features of the various visualization
models it is possible to gain substantial enhancements with respect to classic
visualization models, often unreadable in those cases of great complexity of
the network.

structural incompatibility of two stereo-chemical configurations Cu$^{\rm

spontaneously fluctuating Cu - O - Cu valence bonds which establish a local
Feshbach resonance exchange coupling between bound and unbound electron pairs.
The coupling, being the only free parameter in this scenario, the hole doping
of the parent state is monitored by varying the total number of unpaired and
paired electrons, in chemical equilibrium with each other. Upon lowering the
temperature to below a certain $T^*$, bound and unbound electron pairs lock
together in a local quantum superposition, generating transient localized bound
electron pairs and a concomitant opening of a pseudo-gap in the single-particle
density of states. At low temperature, this pseudo-gap state transits via a
first order hole doping induced phase transition into a superconducting state
in which the localized transient bound electron pairs get spatially phase
correlated. The mechanism driving that transition is a phase separation between
two phases having different relative densities of bound and unbound electron
pairs, which is reminiscent of the physics of $^4$He - $^3$He mixtures.

the widespread adoption of XML in the most disparate application fields pushed
a growing number of researchers to design XML-specific Schema Matching
approaches, called XML Matchers, aiming at finding semantic matchings between
concepts defined in DTDs and XSDs. XML Matchers do not just take well-known
techniques originally designed for other data models and apply them on
DTDs/XSDs, but they exploit specific XML features (e.g., the hierarchical
structure of a DTD/XSD) to improve the performance of the Schema Matching
process. The design of XML Matchers is currently a well-established research
area. The main goal of this paper is to provide a detailed description and
classification of XML Matchers. We first describe to what extent the
specificities of DTDs/XSDs impact on the Schema Matching task. Then we
introduce a template, called XML Matcher Template, that describes the main
components of an XML Matcher, their role and behavior. We illustrate how each
of these components has been implemented in some popular XML Matchers. We
consider our XML Matcher Template as the baseline for objectively comparing
approaches that, at first glance, might appear as unrelated. The introduction
of this template can be useful in the design of future XML Matchers. Finally,
we analyze commercial tools implementing XML Matchers and introduce two

integrated luminosities of up to 5 inverse femtobarns. The distributions of
five event-shape variables in various leading jet pt ranges are compared to
predictions from different QCD Monte Carlo event generators.

initial points, but the blueshift is finite, and is overcompensated by
later-induced redshifts if the observer is sufficiently far. The local
blueshifts cause that $z$ along a light ray is not a monotonic function of the
comoving radial coordinate $r$. As a consequence, the angular diameter distance
$D_A$ and the luminosity distance $D_L$ from the central observer fail to be

a PN junction, typically defined by ionic dopants in a semiconductor. In
atomically thin semiconductors, the doping level can be controlled by the
field-effect without need of implanting dopants in the lattice, which makes 2D
semiconductors prospective materials to implement electrically tunable PN
junctions. However, most 2D semiconducting materials do not show ambipolar
P-type and N-type field-effect transport, necessary to realize PN junctions.
Few-layer black phosphorus is a recently isolated 2D semiconductor that
presents a direct bandgap, high mobility, current on/off ratio and ambipolar
operation. Here, we fabricate few-layer black phosphorus (b-P) field-effect
transistors with split bottom gates and crystalline hexagonal boron nitride
(h-BN) dielectric. We demonstrate electrostatic control of the local charge
carrier type and density above each gate in the device, tuning its electrical
behaviour from metallic to rectifying. Illuminating a gate-defined PN junction,
we observe zero-bias photocurrents and significant open-circuit voltage, which
we attribute to the separation of electron-hole pairs driven by the internal
electric field at the junction region. Due to the small bandgap of the
material, we observe photocurrents and photovoltages for illumination
wavelengths up to 940 nm, attractive for energy harvesting applications in the
near-infrared region

nontrivial almost surely. We denote by $\mathrm{IRS}^{0}(\Gamma)$ the
collection of all nontrivial $\mathrm{IRS}$ on $\Gamma$.
  We show that there exits a free subgroup $F < \Gamma$ and a non-discrete

  We say that an action of $\Gamma$ on a probability space, by measure
preserving transformations, is almost surely non free (ASNF) if almost all
point stabilizers are non-trivial. As a corollary of the above theorem we show

consequence of a more general, underlying dynamical process. In both cases we
shall see that the evolution of a quantum state $P_\psi=\varrho(0)$ has the not
so well-known pseudo-quadratic form
$\partial_t\varrho(t)=\mathbf{V}^\star\varrho(t)\mathbf{V}$ where $\mathbf{V}$
is a vector operator in a complex Minkowski space and the pseudo-adjoint
$\mathbf{V}^\star$ is induced by the Minkowski metric $\boldsymbol{\eta}$. The
interesting thing about this formalism is that its derivation has very deep
roots in a new understanding of the differential calculus of time. This
Minkowski-Hilbert representation of quantum dynamics is called the
\emph{Belavkin Formalism}; a beautiful, but not well understood theory of
mathematical physics that understands that both deterministic and stochastic
dynamics may be `unraveled' in a second-quantized Minkowski space. Working in
such a space provided the author with the means to construct a QS (quantum
stochastic) Duhamel principle and known applications to a Schr\""odinger
dynamics perturbed by a continual measurement process are considered. What is
not known, but presented here, is the role of the Lorentz transform in quantum
measurement, and the appearance of Riemannian geometry in quantum measurement
is also discussed.

highly-correlated interpretations of events, or of jets within an event. For
example, Qjets reclusters a jet multiple times and telescoping jets uses
multiple cone sizes. Previous work has employed these methods in
pseudo-experimental analyses and found that, with a simplified statistical
treatment, they give sizable improvements over traditional methods. In this
paper, the improvement gain from multiple event interpretations is explored
with methods much closer to those used in real experiments. To this end, we
derive a generalized extended maximum likelihood procedure. We study the
significance improvement in Higgs to bb with both this method and the
simplified method from previous analysis. With either method, we find that
using multiple jet radii can provide substantial benefit over a single radius.
Another concern we address is that multiple event interpretations might be
exploiting similar information to that already present in the standard
kinematic variables. By examining correlations between kinematic variables
commonly used in LHC analyses and invariant masses obtained with multiple jet
reconstructions, we find that using multiple radii is still helpful even on top
of standard kinematic variables when combined with boosted decision trees.
These results suggest that including multiple event interpretations in a
realistic search for Higgs to bb would give additional sensitivity over
traditional approaches.

high-dimensional motion planning. Recent progress has taken advantage of random
geometric graph theory to show how asymptotic optimality can also be achieved
with these methods. Achieving this desirable property for systems with dynamics
requires solving a two-point boundary value problem (BVP) in the state space of
the underlying dynamical system. It is difficult, however, if not impractical,
to generate a BVP solver for a variety of important dynamical models of robots
or physically simulated ones. Thus, an open challenge was whether it was even
possible to achieve optimality guarantees when planning for systems without
access to a BVP solver. This work resolves the above question and describes how
to achieve asymptotic optimality for kinodynamic planning using incremental
sampling-based planners by introducing a new rigorous framework. Two new
methods, Stable Sparse-RRT (SST) and SST*, result from this analysis, which are
asymptotically near-optimal and optimal, respectively. The techniques are shown
to converge fast to high-quality paths, while they maintain only a sparse set
of samples, which makes them computationally efficient. The good performance of
the planners is confirmed by experimental results using dynamical systems
benchmarks, as well as physically simulated robots.

D-branes extending the (supersymmetric) standard model could indirectly produce
an effective operator delta{m} n^t n+h.c. In a specific model with an extra
vector-like pair of `quarks', acquiring a large mass proportional to the string
mass scale (exponentially suppressed by a function of the string moduli
fields), delta{m} can turn out to be as low as 10^{-24}-10^{-25} eV. The
induced neutron-antineutron oscillations could take place with a time scale
tau_{n\bar{n}} > 10^8 s, that could be tested by the next generation of
experiments. On the other hand, proton decay and FCNC's are automatically
strongly suppressed and are compatible with the current experimental limits.
Depending on the number of brane intersections, the model may also lead to the
generation of Majorana masses for R-handed neutrini. Our proposal could also
suggest neutron-neutralino or neutron-axino oscillations, with implications in
UCN, Dark Matter Direct Detection, UHECR and Neutron-Antineutron oscillations.
This suggests to improve the limits on neutron-antineutron oscillations, as a
possible test of string theory and quantum gravity.

radio axis in 54 per cent of the sources. The levels of extinction required to
produce near-infrared polarisation by the dichroic extinction mechanism are
consistent with the measured values reported in Ram\'irez et al. (2014),
provided that this mechanism has its maximum efficiency. This consistency
suggests that the nuclear polarisation could be due to dichroic extinction. In
this case, toroidal magnetic fields that are highly coherent would be required
in the circumnuclear tori to align the elongated dust grains responsible for
the dichroic extinction. However, it is not entirely possible to rule out other
polarisation mechanisms (e.g. scattering, synchrotron emission) with our
observations at only one near-IR wavelength. Therefore further polarimetry
observations at mid-IR and radio wavelengths will be required to test whether
all the near-IR polarisation is due to dichroic extinction.

the covariance matrix in principal component analysis (PCA), as well as partial
least squares regression, canonical-correlation analysis and Fisher
discriminant analysis. Recently, many researchers advocate working on
non-centered data. This is the case for instance with the singular value
decomposition approach, with the (kernel) entropy component analysis, with the
information-theoretic learning framework, and even with nonnegative matrix
factorization. Moreover, one can also consider a non-centered PCA by using the
second-order non-central moment.
  The main purpose of this paper is to bridge the gap between these two
viewpoints in designing machine learning methods. To provide a study at the
cornerstone of kernel-based machines, we conduct an eigenanalysis of the inner
product matrices from centered and non-centered data. We derive several results
connecting their eigenvalues and their eigenvectors. Furthermore, we explore
the outer product matrices, by providing several results connecting the largest
eigenvectors of the covariance matrix and its non-centered counterpart. These
results lay the groundwork to several extensions beyond conventional centering,
with the weighted mean shift, the rank-one update, and the multidimensional
scaling. Experiments conducted on simulated and real data illustrate the
relevance of this work.

zero temperature, without assuming either Lorentz or Galilean invariance. This
is done by generalizing Luttinger's approach to thermoelectric phenomena, via
the introduction of a background vielbein (i.e.\ gravitational) field and spin
connection a la Cartan, in addition to the electromagnetic vector potential, in
the action for the microscopic degrees of freedom (the matter fields).
Crucially, the geometry of spacetime is allowed to have timelike and spacelike
torsion. These background fields make all natural invariances--- under U(1)
gauge transformations, translations in both space and time, and spatial
rotations---appear locally, and corresponding conserved currents and the stress
tensor can be obtained, which obey natural continuity equations. On integrating
out the matter fields, we derive the most general form of a local bulk induced
action to first order in derivatives of the background fields, from which
thermodynamic and transport properties can be obtained. We show that the gapped
bulk cannot contribute to low-temperature thermoelectric transport other than
the ordinary Hall conductivity; the other thermoelectric effects (if they
occur) are thus purely edge effects. The coupling to ""reduced"" spacelike
torsion is found to be absent in minimally-coupled models, and using a
generalized Belinfante stress tensor, the stress response to time-dependent
vielbeins (i.e.\ strains) is the Hall viscosity, which is robust against
perturbations and related to the spin current as in earlier work.

consists precisely of all minimal transversals of $\mathcal{G}$ (in which case
we say that $\mathcal{G}$ is the dual of $\mathcal{H}$). This problem is
equivalent to deciding whether two given non-redundant monotone DNFs are dual.
It is known that non-DUAL, the complementary problem to DUAL, is in
$\mathrm{GC}(\log^2 n,\mathrm{PTIME})$, where $\mathrm{GC}(f(n),\mathcal{C})$
denotes the complexity class of all problems that after a nondeterministic
guess of $O(f(n))$ bits can be decided (checked) within complexity class
$\mathcal{C}$. It was conjectured that non-DUAL is in $\mathrm{GC}(\log^2

place the non-DUAL problem into the complexity class $\mathrm{GC}(\log^2

$\mathrm{TC}^0$, which corresponds to $\mathrm{FO(COUNT)}$, i.e., first order
logic augmented by counting quantifiers. We achieve the latter bound in two
steps. First, based on existing problem decomposition methods, we develop a new
nondeterministic algorithm for non-DUAL that requires to guess $O(\log^2 n)$
bits. We then proceed by a logical analysis of this algorithm, allowing us to
formulate its deterministic part in $\mathrm{FO(COUNT)}$. From this result, by
the well known inclusion $\mathrm{TC}^0\subseteq\mathrm{LOGSPACE}$, it follows
that DUAL belongs also to $\mathrm{DSPACE}[\log^2 n]$. Finally, by exploiting
the principles on which the proposed nondeterministic algorithm is based, we
devise a deterministic algorithm that, given two hypergraphs $\mathcal{G}$ and
$\mathcal{H}$, computes in quadratic logspace a transversal of $\mathcal{G}$
missing in $\mathcal{H}$.

the Higgs sector to explicitly solve the doublet-triplet splitting problem

tan\beta, both normal and inverted ordered neutrino spectrum can be
accommodated. However, while the case of inverted order requires a severe fine
tuning of the Yukawa parameters, the normal ordering is compatible with an

superconducting states naturally exist on the honeycomb lattice, of which the
chiral $d+id'$-wave state has previously been shown to appear when
superconductivity appears close to the Mott state. Using renormalized
mean-field theory to study the t-J model and quantum Monte Carlo calculations
of the Hubbard-U model we show that the $d+id'$-wave state is the favored
superconducting state for a wide range of on-site repulsion U, from the
intermediate to the strong coupling regime. We also investigate the possibility
of a mixed chirality d-wave state, where the overall chirality cancels. We find
that a state with $d+id'$-wave symmetry in one valley but $d-id'$-wave symmetry
in the other valley is not possible in the t-J model without reducing the
translational symmetry, due to the zero-momentum and spin-singlet nature of the
superconducting order parameter. Moreover, any extended unit cells result
either in disjoint Dirac points, which cannot harbor this mixed chirality
state, or the two valleys are degenerate at the zone center, where valley
hybridization prevents different superconducting condensates. We also
investigate extended unit cells where the overall chirality cancels in real
space. For supercells containing up to eight sites, including the Kekul\'{e}
distortion, we find no energetically favorable d-wave solution with an overall
zero chirality within the restriction of the t-J model.

$\gamma$-ray burst (GRB) prompt emission with a minimum of free parameters.
Assuming only that GRBs are efficient high-energy proton accelerators and
without the presence of an ab initio photon field, we investigate the
conditions under which the system becomes supercritical, i.e. there is a fast,
non-linear transfer of energy from protons to secondary particles initiated by
the spontaneous quenching of proton-produced $\gamma$-rays. We first show
analytically that the transition to supercriticality occurs whenever the proton
injection compactness exceeds a critical value, which favours high proton
injection luminosities and a wide range of bulk Lorentz factors. The properties
of supercriticality are then studied with a time-dependent numerical code that
solves concurrently the coupled equations of proton, photon, electron, neutron
and neutrino distributions. For conditions that drive the system deep into the
supercriticality we find that the photon spectra obtain a Band-like shape due
to Comptonization by cooled pairs and that the energy transfer efficiency from
protons to $\gamma$-rays and neutrinos is high reaching $\sim 0.3$. Although
some questions concerning its full adaptability to the GRB prompt emission
remain open, supercriticality is found to be a promising process in that
regard.

$\gamma$) and the backward rates ($\beta$ and $\delta$) for each stage. In
particular, the voltage dependence of the Hodgkin-Huxley rate functions for a

define a class of Hamiltonians consisting of local commuting projectors and an
associated matrix that is invariant under local unitary transformations. We
argue that the invariant is equivalent to the topological S-matrix. The

total ejected mass, density profile and kinetic energy of a nova eruption. The
radio emission is typically well characterized by the free-free emission
process. Most models to date have assumed spherical symmetry for the eruption,
although it has been known for as long as there have been radio observations of
these systems, that spherical eruptions are to simplistic a geometry. In this
paper, we build bipolar models of the nova eruption, assuming the free-free
process, and show the effects of varying different parameters on the radio
light curves. The parameters considered include the ratio of the minor- to
major-axis, the inclination angle and shell thickness (further parameters are
provided in the appendix). We also show the uncertainty introduced when fitting
spherical model synthetic light curves to bipolar model synthetic light curves.
We find that the optically thick phase rises with the same power law ($S_{\nu}
\propto t^2$) for both the spherical and bipolar models. In the bipolar case
there is a ""plateau"" phase -- depending on the thickness of the shell as well
as the ratio of the minor- to major-axis -- before the final decline, that
follows the same power law ($S_{\nu} \propto t^{-3}$) as in the spherical case.
Finally, fitting spherical models to the bipolar model synthetic light curves
requires, in the worst case scenario, doubling the ejected mass, more than
halving the electron temperature and reducing the shell thickness by nearly a
factor of 10. This implies that in some systems we have been over predicting
the ejected masses and under predicting the electron temperature of the ejecta.

function in the cluster's inner 39.2 pc in the mass range of 0.53-0.80 M_sun,
ranging from the main-sequence turn-off down to a V-band magnitude of 27.1 mag.
The mass function at different radii is well approximated by a power law and
rises from a shallow slope of 0.6+/-0.2 in the cluster's core to a slope of
1.6+/-0.3 beyond 18.6 pc. This is seemingly in conflict with the finding by
Beccari et al. (2011), who interpret the cluster's non-segregated population of
(more massive) blue straggler stars, compared to (less massive) red giants and
horizontal branch stars, as evidence that the cluster has not experienced
dynamical segregation yet. We discuss how both results can be reconciled. Our
findings indicate that the cluster was either primordially mass-segregated
and/or used to be significantly more compact in the past. For the latter case,
we propose tidal shocks as the mechanism driving the cluster's expansion, which
would imply that Palomar 14 is on a highly eccentric orbit. Conversely, if the

dedicated common proper motion search around nearby stars, along with a few as
serendipitous discoveries from our Pan-STARRS1 brown dwarf search. Our
discoveries include 24 new L dwarf companions and one known L dwarf not
previously identified as a companion. The primary stars around which we
searched for companions come from a list of bright stars with well-measured
parallaxes and large proper motions from the Hipparcos catalog (8583 stars,
mostly A-K~dwarfs) and fainter stars from other proper motion catalogues (79170
stars, mostly M~dwarfs). We examine the likelihood that our companions are
chance alignments between unrelated stars and conclude that this is unlikely
for the majority of the objects that we have followed-up spectroscopically. We
also examine the entire population of ultracool (>M7) dwarf companions and
conclude that while some are loosely bound, most are unlikely to be disrupted
over the course of $\sim$10 Gyr. Our search increases the number of ultracool M
dwarf companions wider than 300 AU by 88% and increases the number of L dwarf
companions in the same separation range by 96%. Finally, we resolve our new L
dwarf companion to HIP 6407 into a tight (0.13 arcsecond, 7.4 AU) L1+T3 binary,
making the system a hierarchical triple. Our search for these key benchmarks
against which brown dwarf and exoplanet atmosphere models are tested has
yielded the largest number of discoveries to date.

the galaxy sample used by the Calar Alto Legacy Integral Field Area Survey
(CALIFA), a public legacy survey of 600 galaxies using integral field
spectroscopy. The CALIFA ""mother sample"" was selected from the Sloan Digital
Sky Survey (SDSS) DR7 photometric catalogue to include all galaxies with an
r-band isophotal major axis between 45"" and 79.2"" and with a redshift 0.005 < z
< 0.03. The mother sample contains 939 objects, 600 of which will be observed
in the course of the CALIFA survey. The selection of targets for observations
is based solely on visibility and thus keeps the statistical properties of the
mother sample. By comparison with a large set of SDSS galaxies, we find that
the CALIFA sample is representative of galaxies over a luminosity range of -19
> Mr > -23.1 and over a stellar mass range between 10^9.7 and 10^11.4Msun. In
particular, within these ranges, the diameter selection does not lead to any
significant bias against - or in favour of - intrinsically large or small
galaxies. Only below luminosities of Mr = -19 (or stellar masses < 10^9.7Msun)
is there a prevalence of galaxies with larger isophotal sizes, especially of
nearly edge-on late-type galaxies, but such galaxies form < 10% of the full
sample. We estimate volume-corrected distribution functions in luminosities and
sizes and show that these are statistically fully compatible with estimates
from the full SDSS when accounting for large-scale structure. We also present a
number of value-added quantities determined for the galaxies in the CALIFA
sample. We explore different ways of characterizing the environments of CALIFA
galaxies, finding that the sample covers environmental conditions from the
field to genuine clusters. We finally consider the expected incidence of active
galactic nuclei among CALIFA galaxies.

measurements of sample clusters, we simultaneously calibrate the
mass-observable relation and constrain cosmological parameters. The
calibrations using $\sigma_v$ and Yx are consistent at the $0.6\sigma$ level,
with the $\sigma_v$ calibration preferring ~16% higher masses. We use the full
cluster dataset to measure $\sigma_8(\Omega_ m/0.27)^{0.3}=0.809\pm0.036$. The
SPT cluster abundance is lower than preferred by either the WMAP9 or
Planck+WMAP9 polarization (WP) data, but assuming the sum of the neutrino
masses is $\sum m_\nu=0.06$ eV, we find the datasets to be consistent at the
1.0$\sigma$ level for WMAP9 and 1.5$\sigma$ for Planck+WP. Allowing for larger
$\sum m_\nu$ further reconciles the results. When we combine the cluster and
Planck+WP datasets with BAO and SNIa, the preferred cluster masses are
$1.9\sigma$ higher than the Yx calibration and $0.8\sigma$ higher than the
$\sigma_v$ calibration. Given the scale of these shifts (~44% and ~23% in mass,
respectively), we execute a goodness of fit test; it reveals no tension,
indicating that the best-fit model provides an adequate description of the
data. Using the multi-probe dataset, we measure $\Omega_ m=0.299\pm0.009$ and
$\sigma_8=0.829\pm0.011$. Within a $\nu$CDM model we find $\sum m_\nu =
0.148\pm0.081$ eV. We present a consistency test of the cosmic growth rate.
Allowing both the growth index $\gamma$ and the dark energy equation of state
parameter $w$ to vary, we find $\gamma=0.73\pm0.28$ and $w=-1.007\pm0.065$,
demonstrating that the expansion and the growth histories are consistent with a

parameters are usually close to those of the two planets in the system most
responsible for the perturbations. However, in one of the 16 examples, the
apparent mass of both detected planets was more than doubled by the unmodeled
influence of a third, massive planet. This fraction is larger than, but
statistically consistent with, the roughly 1.5% rate of serious mass errors due
to unmodeled planetary companions for the 274 cases from the same simulation in
which a single planet is recovered. We conjecture that an analogous effect due
to unmodeled stellar companions may occur more frequently. For seven out of 23
cases in which two planets in the system would have been detected separately,
only one planet was recovered because the perturbations due to the two planets
had similar forms. This is a small fraction (7/274) of all recovered
single-planet models, but almost a third of all events that might plausibly
have led to two-planet models. Still, in these cases, the recovered planet
tends to have parameters similar to one of the two real planets most

Ly$\alpha$ emission is powered by the ionizing luminosity of an obscured AGN.
Our models can accommodate HeII/Ly$\alpha$ and CIV/Ly$\alpha$ ratios as low as

the expected HeII/Ly$\alpha$ and CIV/Ly$\alpha$ in a different scenario, where
Ly$\alpha$ emission is powered by shocks generated in a large-scale superwind,

exponential growth (e.g., the Black-Scholes equation or geometric Brownian

reaction cycle in which each molecular species catalyzes the production of the
next. By finding exact analytical solutions to the SHC and the corresponding
first passage time problem, we uncover universal signatures of fluctuations in
exponential growth and division. The model makes minimal assumptions, and we
describe how more complex reaction networks can reduce to such a cycle. We thus
expect similar scalings to be discovered in stochastic processes resulting in
exponential growth that appear in diverse contexts such as cosmology, finance,

hosts a wide-angle tail (WAT) radio source powered by a central active galactic
nucleus (AGN). We find evidence for a cavity in the intracluster medium (ICM)
that has been evacuated by one of the radio lobes, suggesting that AGN feedback
is operating in this system. Examples of cavities in non-cool core clusters are
relatively rare. The three subclusters lie along a line in projection,
suggesting the presence of a large-scale filament. We observe emission along
the filament between A98N and A98S, and a surface brightness profile shows
emission consistent with the overlap of the subcluster extended gas haloes. We
find the temperature of this region is consistent with the temperature of the

direct evidence for the existence of an eternally inflating Multiverse; the
non-observation of such events can also provide important constraints on
inflationary physics. Realizing these prospects requires quantitative
predictions for observables from the properties of the possible scalar field
Lagrangians underlying eternal inflation. Building on previous work, we
establish this connection in detail. We perform a fully relativistic numerical
study of the phenomenology of bubble collisions in models with a single scalar
field, computing the comoving curvature perturbation produced in a wide variety
of models. We also construct a set of analytic predictions, allowing us to
identify the phenomenologically relevant properties of the scalar field
Lagrangian. The agreement between the analytic predictions and numerics in the
relevant regions is excellent, and allows us to generalize our results beyond
the models we adopt for the numerical studies. Specifically, the signature is
completely determined by the spatial profile of the colliding bubble just
before the collision, and the de Sitter invariant distance between the bubble
centers. The analytic and numerical results support a power-law fit with an
index $1< \kappa \lesssim 2$. For collisions between identical bubbles, we
establish a lower-bound on the observed amplitude of collisions that is set by
the present energy density in curvature.

synthesizing polynomial Lyapunov functions to prove the stability of polynomial
ODEs. A common approach to Lyapunov function synthesis starts from a desired
parametric polynomial form of the polynomial Lyapunov function. Subsequently,
we encode the positive-definiteness of the function, and the
negative-definiteness of its derivative over the domain of interest. Therefore,
the key primitives for this encoding include: (a) proving that a given
polynomial is positive definite over a domain of interest, and (b) encoding the
positive definiteness of a given parametric polynomial, as a constraint on the
unknown parameters. We first examine two classes of relaxations for proving
polynomial positivity: relaxations by sum-of-squares (SOS) programs, against
relaxations that produce linear programs. We compare both types of relaxations
by examining the class of polynomials that can be shown to be positive in each
case. Next, we present a progression of increasingly more powerful LP
relaxations based on expressing the given polynomial in its Bernstein form, as
a linear combination of Bernstein polynomials. The well-known bounds on
Bernstein polynomials over the unit box help us formulate increasingly precise
LP relaxations that help us establish the positive definiteness of a polynomial
over a bounded domain. Subsequently, we show how these LP relaxations can be
used to search for Lyapunov functions for polynomial ODEs by formulating LP
instances. We compare our approaches to synthesizing Lyapunov functions with
approaches based on SOS programming relaxations.

problems in star and galaxy formation. The past decades have seen important
progress in constraining the physics of GC formation from a variety of
directions. In this review, we discuss the latest constraints obtained from
studies of present-day GC populations, the formation of young massive clusters
(YMCs) in the local Universe, and the observed, large-scale conditions for star
and cluster formation in high-redshift galaxies. The main conclusion is that
the formation of massive, GC progenitor clusters is restricted to high-pressure
environments similar to those observed at high redshift and at the sites of YMC
formation in the local Universe. However, the correspondingly high gas
densities also lead to efficient cluster disruption by impulsive tidal shocks,
which limits the survival of GCs progenitor clusters. As a result, the
long-term survival of GC progenitor clusters requires them to migrate into the
host galaxy halo on a short time-scale. It is proposed that the necessary
cluster migration is facilitated by the frequent galaxy mergers occurring at
high redshift. We use the available observational and theoretical constraints
to condense the current state of the field into a coherent picture of GC
formation, in which regular star and cluster formation in high-redshift
galaxies naturally leads to the GC populations observed today.

dynamical system are locally inferred from the system at steady state. Here we
focus on steady states that are the positive solutions to a parameterised

computational algebra have been developed to understand these solutions, but
our knowledge is limited: for example, we cannot efficiently decide how many
positive solutions the system has as a function of the parameters. Even
deciding whether there is one or more solutions is non-trivial. We present a
new method, based on so-called injectivity, to preclude or assert that multiple
positive solutions exist. The results apply to generalised polynomials and
variables can be restricted to the linear, parameter-independent first
integrals of the dynamical system. The method has been tested in a wide range
of systems.

\emph{correlations} can be exploited in multi-probe noise studies to reveal

spectroscopy, such as the underlying homogeneous linewidths of individual
constituents within inhomogeneously-broadened systems. This is demonstrated in
an ensemble of singly-charged (In,Ga)As quantum dots using two weak probe
lasers: When the two lasers have the same wavelength, they are sensitive to the
same QDs in the ensemble and their spin fluctuation signals are correlated. In
contrast, two probe lasers that are widely detuned from each other measure
different subsets of QDs, leading to uncorrelated fluctuations. Measuring the
noise correlation versus laser detuning directly reveals the QD homogeneous
linewidth even in the presence of a strong inhomogeneous broadening. Such
noise-based correlation techniques are not limited to semiconductor spin
systems, but can be widely applied to any system in which intrinsic
fluctuations are measurable.

Most multivariate polynomials are irreducible. This survey presents counting
results for some special classes of multivariate polynomials over a finite
field, namely the the reducible ones, the s-powerful ones (divisible by the
s-th power of a nonconstant polynomial), the relatively irreducible ones
(irreducible but reducible over an extension field), the decomposable ones, and
also for reducible space curves. These come as exact formulas and as
approximations with relative errors that essentially decrease exponentially in
the input size.
  Furthermore, a univariate polynomial f is decomposable if f = g o h for some
nonlinear polynomials g and h. It is intuitively clear that the decomposable
polynomials form a small minority among all polynomials. The tame case, where
the characteristic p of Fq does not divide n = deg f, is fairly
well-understood, and we obtain closely matching upper and lower bounds on the
number of decomposable polynomials. In the wild case, where p does divide n,
the bounds are less satisfactory, in particular when p is the smallest prime
divisor of n and divides n exactly twice. The crux of the matter is to count
the number of collisions, where essentially different (g, h) yield the same f.
We present a classification of all collisions at degree n = p^2 which yields an

the 10-meter South Pole Telescope (SPT). The SPT-3G receiver will deliver a
factor of ~20 improvement in mapping speed over the current receiver, SPTpol.
The sensitivity of the SPT-3G receiver will enable the advance from statistical
detection of B-mode polarization anisotropy power to high signal-to-noise
measurements of the individual modes, i.e., maps. This will lead to precise
(~0.06 eV) constraints on the sum of neutrino masses with the potential to
directly address the neutrino mass hierarchy. It will allow a separation of the
lensing and inflationary B-mode power spectra, improving constraints on the
amplitude and shape of the primordial signal, either through SPT-3G data alone
or in combination with BICEP-2/KECK, which is observing the same area of sky.
The measurement of small-scale temperature anisotropy will provide new
constraints on the epoch of reionization. Additional science from the SPT-3G
survey will be significantly enhanced by the synergy with the ongoing optical
Dark Energy Survey (DES), including: a 1% constraint on the bias of optical
tracers of large-scale structure, a measurement of the differential Doppler
signal from pairs of galaxy clusters that will test General Relativity on ~200
Mpc scales, and improved cosmological constraints from the abundance of
clusters of galaxies.

on the dimension of $X$. It is intimately linked with the combinatorial
patterns of real divisors of real polynomials in one variable of degrees which
do not exceed $2(n+1)$. Such patterns are elements of another natural poset

divide, appear, and disappear under deformations of real polynomials. The space

observed by IceCube in the energy range 30 TeV--2 PeV can be explained by a
diffuse flux of neutrinos produced in such slow-jet supernovae, using the
values of astrophysical and QCD parameters within the theoretical uncertainties
associated with neutrino production from charmed meson decay in astrophysical
sources. We discuss the theoretical uncertainties inherent in the evaluation of
charm production in high energy hadronic collisions, as well as the
astrophysical uncertainties associated with slow-jet supernova sources. The
proton flux within the source, and therefore also the produced neutrino flux,
is cut off at around a few PeV, when proton cooling processes become dominant
over proton acceleration. This directly explains the sudden drop in event rates
at energies above a few PeV. We incorporate the effect of energy dependence in
the spectrum-weighted charm production cross-section and show that this has a
very significant effect on the shape, magnitude and cut-off energies for the
neutrino flux.

Since internal mixing processes influence their lives, it is very important to
place constraints on the corresponding physical parameters, such as core
overshooting and the internal rotation profile, so as to calibrate their
stellar structure and evolution models. Although asteroseismology has been
shown to be able to deliver the most precise constraints so far, the number of
detailed seismic studies delivering quantitative results is limited. Our goal
is to extend this limited sample with an in-depth case study and provide a
well-constrained set of asteroseismic parameters, contributing to the ongoing
mapping efforts of the instability strips of the beta Cep and SPB stars. We
derived fundamental parameters from high-resolution spectra using spectral
synthesis techniques. We used custom masks to obtain optimal light curves from
the original pixel level data from the Kepler satellite. We used standard
time-series analysis tools to construct a set of significant pulsation modes
that provide the basis for the seismic analysis carried out afterwards. We find
that KIC 10526294 is a cool SPB star, one of the slowest rotators ever found.
Despite this, the length of Kepler observations is sufficient to resolve narrow
rotationally split multiplets for each of its 19 quasi-equally spaced dipole
modes. The number of detected consecutive (in radial order) dipole modes in
this series is higher than ever before. The observed amount of splitting shows
an increasing trend towards longer periods, which - largely independent of the
seismically calibrated stellar models - points towards a non-rigid internal
rotation profile. From the average splitting we deduce a rotation period of
~188 d. From seismic modelling, we find that the star is young with a central
hydrogen mass fraction X_c>0.64; it has a core overshooting alpha_ov<=0.15.

many 2-safety properties, differential privacy lies outside the scope of
traditional verification techniques. Existing approaches to enforce privacy are

and is independent of the target achievable rate, in the sense that the encoder
core is the regular Ar{\i}kan's polarization matrix. For the code construction,
the positions of information bits and frozen bits for each of the users are
decided jointly. This is done by treating the whole polar transformation across

prove that the covering radius of the dominant face of the uniform rate region

where the latency or delay function on an edge has a heterogeneous dependency
on the flow commodities, i.e. when the delay on each link is dependent on the
flow of individual commodities, rather than on the aggregate flow. An
application of this study is the performance analysis of a network with
differentiated traffic that may arise when traffic is prioritized according to
some type classification. This study has implications in the debate on
net-neutrality. We provide price of anarchy bounds for networks with $k$ (types
of) commodities where each link is associated with heterogeneous polynomial
delays, i.e. commodity $i$ on edge $e$ faces delay specified by
$g_{i1}(e)f^{\theta}_1(e) + g_{i2}(e)f^{\theta}_2(e) + \ldots +
g_{ik}(e)f^{\theta}_k(e) + c_i(e), $ where $f_i(e)$ is the flow of the $i$th
commodity through edge $e$, $\theta \in {\cal N}$, $g_{i1}(e), g_{i2}(e),
\ldots, g_{ik}(e)$ and $c_i(e)$ are nonnegative constants. We consider both
atomic and non-atomic flows.
  For networks with decomposable delay functions where the delay induced by a
particular commodity is the same, i.e. delays on edge $e$ are defined by
$a_1(e)f_1^\theta(e) + a_2(e)f_2^\theta(e) + \ldots + c(e)$ where $\forall j ,
\forall e: g_{1j}(e) = g_{2j}(e) = \ldots = a_j(e)$, we show an improved bound
on the price of anarchy.

Carlo simulations, we have systematically investigated the effects of dilute
substitutional solutes on the behaviors of carbon in $\alpha$-Fe. Our results
uncover that: ($i$) Without the Fe vacancy the interactions between most
solutes and carbon are repulsive due to the strain relief, whereas Mn has a
weak attractive interaction with its nearest-neighbor carbon due to the local
ferromagnetic coupling effect. ($ii$) The presence of the Fe vacancy results in
attractive interactions of all the solutes with carbon. In particular, the
Mn-vacancy pair shows an exceptionally large binding energy of -0.81 eV with
carbon. ($iii$) The alloying addition significantly impacts the atomic-scale
concentration distributions and chemical potential of carbon in the Fe matrix.
Among them, Mn and Cr increase the carbon chemical potential whereas Al and Si
reduce it. ($iv$) Within the dilute scale of the alloying solution, the solute
concentration and temperature dependent carbon diffusivities demonstrate that
Mn has a little impact on the carbon diffusion whereas Cr (Al or Si) remarkably
retards the carbon diffusion. Our results provide certain implication for
better understanding the experimental observations related with the carbon

been applicable for astronomical optical spectrographs. However, VPH gratings
have been less exploited in the near-infrared, particularly for gratings that

potential dispersing element in the spectrograph. Our team has procured
near-infrared gratings from two separate vendors. We have two gratings with the

produce a spectral resolution of 4000 and 1.19- 1.37 {\mu}m (J-band) to produce
a spectral resolution of 8000. The center wavelengths for each grating are
1.629{\mu}m and 1.27{\mu}m, and the groove densities are 177l/mm and 440l/mm

This is done by comparing the overlap of any two quantum states with the
overlap of the corresponding classical probability distributions over ontic
states in a \psi-epistemic model. It is shown that in Hilbert spaces of
dimension $d \geq 4$, the ratio between the classical and quantum overlaps in
any \psi-epistemic model must be arbitrarily small for certain nonorthogonal

indistinguishability of quantum states. For dimensions $d$ = 3 and 4, we
construct explicit states and measurements that can be used experimentally to
put stringent bounds on the ratio of classical-to-quantum overlaps in

framework can be used to identify biclusters that differ with respect to the
means of the features, the variance of the features, or more general
differences. We apply these methods to several simulated and real-world data

$\eta(\theta)$ where $\theta$ denotes the uncertain, best input setting. Hence
the statistical model is of the form $y = \eta(\theta) + \epsilon$, where
$\epsilon$ accounts for measurement, and possibly other error sources. When
non-linearity is present in $\eta(\cdot)$, the resulting posterior distribution
for the unknown parameters in the Bayesian formulation is typically complex and
non-standard, requiring computationally demanding computational approaches such
as Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) to produce multivariate draws from the
posterior. While quite generally applicable, MCMC requires thousands, or even
millions of evaluations of the physics model $\eta(\cdot)$. This is problematic
if the model takes hours or days to evaluate. To overcome this computational
bottleneck, we present an approach adapted from Bayesian model calibration.
This approach combines output from an ensemble of computational model runs with
physical measurements, within a statistical formulation, to carry out
inference. A key component of this approach is a statistical response surface,
or emulator, estimated from the ensemble of model runs. We demonstrate this
approach with a case study in estimating parameters for a density functional

find that an increase in the superconducting gap suppresses both the

essentially independent of the superconducting gap, an intriguing phenomenon

superconductors. In the lightly-doped region close to the insulating state, the
system shows a gap-like behavior, i.e., pseudogap, that is characterized by a
reduction in the magnitude of the Knight shift and 1/T_1T. A higher
superconducting (SC) transition temperature, T_c, is achieved by coexisting
with the pseudogap state. These unusual behaviors, which deviate from the
ordinary BCS framework, are the key ingredients to understanding the SC
mechanism of Li_xZrNCl.

processes, diagnostics, sensing, communications, and scientific measurement.
During traditional amplification, the signal is amplified by multiplying the
signal carriers through an active gain process using an external power source.
However, for repetitive waveforms, sufficient energy for amplification often
resides in the signal itself. In such cases, the unneeded external power is
wasted, and the signal is additionally degraded by noise and distortions that
accompany active gain processes. We show noiseless, intensity amplification of
repetitive optical pulse waveforms with a gain from 2 to ~20 without using
active gain, by recycling energy already stored in the input repetitive signal.
This ""green"" method uses dispersion-induced self-imaging (Talbot) effects to
precisely re-distribute the original signal energy into fewer replica
waveforms. This approach simply requires a suitable manipulation of the input
signal's phase profile along the temporal and spectral domains. In addition, we
show experimentally how our passive amplifier performs a real-time average of
the wave train to reduce noise fluctuation present on the input pulse train, as
well as enhances the extinction ratio of pulses to stand above the noise floor
by approximately the passive gain factor. Finally, our technique is applicable
to repetitive waveforms in any spectral region or wave system, including
acoustic, mechanical, and quantum probability waveforms, for which active
amplification methods are challenging to implement or nonexistent.

sources, the [C II] emission is distributed along the outflow, as is the [O I]
emission. The atomic line luminosities correlate well with each other, as do
the molecular lines, but the atomic and molecular lines correlate poorly. The
relative contribution of CO to the total gas cooling is constant at $\sim$30 %,
while the cooling fraction by H$_2$O varies from source to source, suggesting
different shock properties resulting in different photodissociation levels of
H$_2$O. The gas with a power-law temperature distribution with a moderately
high density can reproduce the observed CO fluxes, indicative of CO close to
LTE. However, H$_2$O is mostly subthermally excited. L1551-IRS5 is the most
luminous source ($L_{\rm bol}=24.5$ L$_\odot$) and the [O I] 63.1 $\mu$m line

shifts of the [O I] line, which exceed the wavelength calibration uncertainty

compute in linear time a sparse certificate for this relation, i.e., a subgraph
of the input graph that has $O(n)$ edges and maintains the same

particular features, we propose a two-cloud model to fit the observed line
profiles. The lower cloud can account for the wing emission, and the upper
cloud is mainly responsible for the absorption at line center. After choosing
carefully the free parameters, we get satisfactory fitting results. As
expected, the lower cloud shows an increase of the source function,
corresponding to a temperature increase of 400--1000 K in EBs relative to the
quiet Sun. This is consistent with previous results deduced from semi-empirical
models and confirms that a local heating occurs in the lower atmosphere during
the appearance of EBs. We also find that the optical depths can increase to
some extent in both the lower and upper clouds, which may result from either a
direct heating in the lower cloud, or illumination by an enhanced radiation on
the upper cloud. The velocities derived from this method, however, are
different from those obtained using the traditional bisector method, implying
that one should be cautious when interpreting this parameter. The two-cloud

the GCM wave function. The better result is obtained with the sTHSR wave
function than the BB wave function, and further improvement can be done with
the dTHSR wave function because these wave functions can describe the outer

better quality than the dTHSR wave function indicating that the outer tail of

fiber-fed spectrographs to observe at optical and infrared wavelengths. The use
of fibers largely simplifies the interfacing of the spectrograph to the

achieve very high spectral accuracy. GIANO is an infrared (0.95-2.5\mu m) high
resolution (R=50,000) spectrometer[1] [2] [3] that was recently commissioned at
the TNG telescope (La Palma). This instrument was designed and built for direct
feeding from the telescope [4]. However, due to constraints imposed on the
telescope interfacing during the pre-commissioning phase, it had to be
positioned on the rotating building, far from the telescope focus. Therefore, a
new interface to the telescope, based on IR-transmitting ZBLAN fibers with 85
\mu m core, was developed. In this article we report the first, preliminary
results of the effects of these fibers on the quality of the recorded spectra
with GIANO and with a similar spectrograph that we set-up in the laboratory.
The effects can be primarily associated to modal-noise (MN) that, in GIANO, is
much more evident than in optical spectrometers, because of the much longer
wavelengths.

by the existence of electron quasiparticles near a Fermi surface as long as
Landau's interaction parameters lie below critical values for instabilities.
Recently, this fundamental paradigm has been challenged by physics of strong
spin-orbit coupling although the concept of electron quasiparticles remains
valid near the Fermi surface, where the Landau's Fermi-liquid theory fails to
describe electromagnetic properties of this novel metallic state, referred to
as Weyl metal. A novel ingredient is that such a Fermi surface encloses a Weyl
point with definite chirality, referred to as a chiral Fermi surface, which can
arise from breaking of either time reversal or inversion symmetry in systems
with strong spin-orbit coupling, responsible for both Berry curvature and
chiral anomaly. As a result, electromagnetic properties of the Weyl metallic
state are described not by conventional Maxwell equations but by axion
electrodynamics, where Maxwell equations are modified with a
topological-in-origin spatially modulated $\theta(\bm{r}) \bm{E} \cdot \bm{B}$
term. This novel metallic state has been realized recently in
Bi$_{1-x}$Sb$_{x}$ around $x \sim 3%$ under magnetic fields, where the Dirac
spectrum appears around the critical point between the normal semiconducting
($x < 3%$) and topological semiconducting phases ($x > 3%$) and the time
reversal symmetry breaking perturbation causes the Dirac point to split into a
pair of Weyl points along the direction of the applied magnetic field for such
a strong spin-orbit coupled system. In this review article, we discuss how the
topological structure of both the Berry curvature and chiral anomaly (axion
electrodynamics) gives rise to anomalous transport phenomena in
Bi$_{1-x}$Sb$_{x}$ around $x \sim 3%$ under magnetic fields, modifying the
Drude model of Landau's Fermi liquids.

spectrograph providing long-slit, single-order spectroscopy with resolving
power up to R=100,000 over a quite narrow spectral range. This has resulted in
sub-optimal efficiency and use of telescope time for all the scientific
programs requiring broad spectral coverage of compact objects (e.g. chemical
abundances of stars and intergalactic medium, search and characterization of
extra-solar planets). To overcome these limitations, a consortium was set-up
for upgrading CRIRES to a cross-dispersed spectrometer, called CRIRES+. This
paper presents the updated optical design of the crossdispersion module for
CRIRES+. This new module can be mounted in place of the current pre-disperser

phenotypic coevolution of prey and predators. The community evolves as a
multi-type birth and death process with mutations. We first consider the
infinite particle approximation of the process without mutation. In this limit,
the process can be approximated by a system of differential equations. We prove
the existence of a unique globally asymptotically stable equilibrium under
specific conditions on the interaction among prey individuals. When mutations
are rare, the community evolves on the mutational scale according to a
Markovian jump process. This process describes the successive equilibria of the
prey-predator community and extends the Polymorphic Evolutionary Sequence to a
coevolutionary framework. We then assume that mutations have a small impact on
phenotypes and consider the evolution of monomorphic prey and predator
populations. The limit of small mutation steps leads to a system of two
differential equations which is a version of the canonical equation of adaptive
dynamics for the prey-predator coevolution. We illustrate these different

The infrared structure of gauge theory amplitudes depends on the regularization

observations will confirm the large r value reported by BICEP2, it is important
to determine what kind of dynamical mechanism could possibly endow the inflaton
field with such a simple effective potential. In this paper, we answer this
question in the context of field theory, i.e. in the framework of dynamical
chaotic inflation (DCI), where strongly interacting supersymmetric gauge
dynamics around the scale of grand unification dynamically generate a
fractional power-law potential via the quantum effect of dimensional
transmutation. In constructing explicit models, we significantly extend our
previous work, as we now consider a large variety of possible underlying gauge
dynamics and relax our conditions on the field content of the model. This
allows us to realize almost arbitrary rational values for the power p in the
inflaton potential. The present paper may hence be regarded as a first step
towards a more complete theory of dynamical chaotic inflation.

code is not altered by new program changes. The primary focus of regression
testing should be on code associated with: a) earlier bug fixes; and b)
particular application scenarios considered to be important by the tester.
Existing coverage criteria do not enable such focus, e.g., 100% branch coverage
does not guarantee that a given bug fix is exercised or a given application
scenario is tested. Therefore, there is a need for a complementary coverage
criterion in which the user can define a test requirement characterizing a
given behavior to be covered as opposed to choosing from a pool of pre-defined
and generic program elements. We propose UCov, a user-defined coverage
criterion wherein a test requirement is an execution pattern of program
elements and predicates. Our proposed criterion is not meant to replace
existing criteria, but to complement them as it focuses the testing on
important code patterns that could go untested otherwise. UCov supports test
case intent verification. For example, following a bug fix, the testing team
may augment the regression suite with the test case that revealed the bug.
However, this test case might become obsolete due to code modifications not
related to the bug. But if an execution pattern characterizing the bug was
defined by the user, UCov would determine that test case intent verification
failed. We implemented our methodology for the Java platform and applied it
onto two real life case studies. Our implementation comprises the following: 1)
an Eclipse plugin allowing the user to easily specify non-trivial test
requirements; 2) the ability of cross referencing test requirements across
subsequent versions of a given program; and 3) the ability of checking whether
user-defined test requirements were satisfied, i.e., test case intent

of contact as being composed of a regular array of compressible elastic smooth
microscopic inclines. Static friction is thought of as the resistance due to
having to push the load over these smooth microscopic inclines that share a
common inclination angle. As the normal force between the surfaces increases,
the microscopic inclines would be compressed elastically. Consequently, the
coefficient of static friction does not remain constant but becomes smaller for
a larger normal force, since the load would then only need to be pushed over
smaller angles. However, a larger normal force would also increase the
effective compressed area between the surfaces, as such the pressure is
distributed over this larger effective compressed area. The relationship
between the normal force and the common angle is therefore non-linear. Overall,
static friction is shown to depend on the normal force, apparent contact area,
Young's modulus, and the compressed efficiency ratio (effective compressed area
per apparent contact area). Experimental measurements using teflon were carried
out, and the results confirm predictions of this theory.

Recent experiments support the possibillity for a BCS-BEC crossover induced by
strong-coupling and proximity of the chemical potential to the band edge of one
of the bands. Here we study the simplest theoretical model which accounts for
the BCS-BEC crossover in a two-band superconductor, considering tunable
interactions and tunable energy separations between the bands. Mean-field
results for condensate fraction, correlation length, and superconducting gap
are reported in typical crossover diagrams to locate the boundaries of the BCS,
crossover, and BEC regimes. When the superconducting gap is of the order of the
local chemical potential, superconductivity is in the crossover regime of the
BCS-BEC crossover and the Fermi surface of the small band is smeared by the gap
opening. In this situation, small and large Cooper pairs coexist in the total
condensate, which is the optimal condition for high-Tc superconductivity. The
ratio between the gap and the Fermi energy in a given band results to be the
best detection parameter for experiments to locate the system in the BCS-BEC
crossover. Using available experimental data, our analysis shows that
iron-based superconductors have the partial condensate of the small Fermi
surface in the crossover regime of the BCS-BEC crossover, supporting the recent
ARPES findings.

energy experiments this is the kinematical region where searches for BFKL

collinear approach within the so-called factorized Ansatz. We show that the
relative contribution of DPS is growing with respect to standard single-parton
scattering (SPS) production of dijets and to the BFKL Mueller-Navelet (MN) jet
mechanism at large rapidity distance between jets. This is consistent with
recent studies of DPS effects in the case of double $D$ and double $J/\!\psi$
meson production. The calculated differential cross sections as a function of
rapidity distance between the jets that are the most distant in rapidity are
compared with recent results of LL and NLL BFKL calculations for the
Mueller-Navelet jet production at $\sqrt{s} = 7$ TeV. The DPS contribution is
carefully studied for $\sqrt{s}$ = 7 TeV and $\sqrt{s}$ = 14 TeV and in

ideally to its quantum ground state. Cooling by an applied charge current is a
particularly simple and hence attractive strategy to this effect. Here, we
explore this phenomenon in the context of the general theory of
thermoelectrics. In linear response, this theory describes thermoelectric
refrigerators in terms of their cooling efficiency and figure of merit ZT. We
show that both concepts carry over to phonon cooling in nanoelectromechanical
systems. As an important consequence, this allows us to discuss the efficiency
of phonon refrigerators in relation to the fundamental Carnot efficiency. We
illustrate these general concepts by thoroughly investigating a simple
double-quantum-dot model with the dual advantage of being quite realistic
experimentally and amenable to a largely analytical analysis theoretically.
Specifically, we obtain results for the efficiency, the figure of merit, and
the effective temperature of the vibrational motion in two regimes. In the
quantum regime in which the vibrational motion is fast compared to the
electronic degrees of freedom, we can describe the electronic and phononic
dynamics of the model in terms of master equations. In the complementary
classical regime of slow vibrational motion, the dynamics is described in terms
of an appropriate Langevin equation. Remarkably, we find that the efficiency
can approach the maximal Carnot value in the quantum regime, with large
associated figures of merit. In contrast, the efficiencies are typically far
from the Carnot limit in the classical regime. Our theoretical results should
provide guidance to implementing efficient vibrational cooling of
nanoelectromechanical systems in the laboratory.

metallicity and primordial binaries on Milky Way globular clusters' integrated

resulting in a binary fraction as currently observed at a model age of
GCs.Stellar evolution and external tidal field representative for an average
Milky Way GC are taken into consideration. The integrated colours and Lick
indices are calculated using BaSeL and Bluered stellar spectral libraries
separately.
  By including dynamical interactions, our model clusters show integrated
features (colours up to 0.01mag bluer, H$\beta$ up to 0.1\AA $ $ greater and
[MgFe]$'$ 0.05\AA $ $ smaller) making the clusters appear slightly younger than
the model clusters without dynamical interactions. This effect is caused mainly
by the preferential loss of low-mass stars which have a stronger contribution
to redder passbands as well as different spectral features compared to
higher-mass stars. In addition, this effect is larger at lower metallicities.
On the contrary, the incorporation of primordial binaries reduces this effect.

of fundamental biological phenomena and for applications such as drug
discovery. The advent of novel nano-scale sensors has given hope of achieving
the long-standing goal of single-protein, high spatial-resolution structure
determination in their natural environment and ambient conditions. In
particular, quantum sensors based on the spin-dependent photoluminescence of
Nitrogen Vacancy (NV) centers in diamond have recently been used to detect
nanoscale ensembles of external nuclear spins. While NV sensitivity is
approaching single-spin levels, extracting relevant information from a very
complex structure is a further challenge, since it requires not only the
ability to sense the magnetic field of an isolated nuclear spin, but also to
achieve atomic-scale spatial resolution. Here we propose a method that, by
exploiting the coupling of the NV center to an intrinsic quantum memory
associated with the Nitrogen nuclear spin, can reach a tenfold improvement in
spatial resolution, down to atomic scales. The spatial resolution enhancement
is achieved through coherent control of the sensor spin, which creates a
dynamic frequency filter selecting only a few nuclear spins at a time. We
propose and analyze a protocol that would allow not only sensing individual
spins in a complex biomolecule, but also unraveling couplings among them, thus
elucidating local characteristics of the molecule structure.

to the new setup we were able to run simulations for more than 150,000
dynamical times on a domain extending 1500 inner disk radii with a resolution
of up to 24 cells per disk height in the inner disk. Depending on the disk
magnetization, jet launching occurs in two different but complementary regimes
- jets driven predominantly by centrifugal or magnetic forces. These regimes
differ in the ejection efficiency concerning mass, energy and angular momentum.
We show that it is the {\em actual} disk magnetization and not so much the
initial magnetization which describes the disk-jet evolution best. Considering
the actual disk magnetization we also find that simulations starting with
different initial magnetization evolve in a similar - typical - way as due to
advection and diffusion the magnetic flux in the disk evolves in time.
Exploring a new, modified diffusivity model we confirm the self-similar
structure of the global jet-launching disk, obtaining power laws for the radial
profiles of the disk physical variables such as density, magnetic field
strength, or accretion velocity.

A prominent example is the ability of tumor cells to switch between migratory

however unclear how this particular phenotypic plasticity affects overall tumor
growth. To address this problem, we formulate and study a mathematical model of
spatio-temporal tumor dynamics where different responses to local cell density
mediate the go-or-grow dichotomy. Our analysis reveals that two dynamic regimes
can be distinguished. If cell motility is allowed to increase with local cell
density, any tumor cell population will persist in time, irrespective of its
initial size. On the contrary, if cell motility is assumed to decrease with
respect to local cell density, an Allee effect emerges, so that any tumor
population below a certain size threshold eventually extinguishes. These
results suggest that strategies aimed at hindering migration, for instance by
enhancing contact inhibition, are worth to be explored as alternatives to those
mainly focused at checking tumor proliferation.

correlated with the mass of the white dwarf (WD), which is the degenerate He

few hours), mainly depending on the metallicities of the donor stars. There is
also discontinuity in the relation, which is due to the temporary contraction

problem. The buyer proposes the price that can differ greatly from the paper
value estimated by the seller, the seller, on the other hand, can not liquidate
his portfolio instantly and waits for a more favorable offer. To minimize
losses in this case we need to develop new methods. One of the steps moving the
theory towards practical needs is to take into account the time lag of the
liquidation of an illiquid asset. This task became especially significant for
the practitioners in the time of the global financial crises. Working in the
Merton's optimal consumption framework with continuous time we consider an
optimization problem for a portfolio with an illiquid, a risky and a risk-free
asset. While a standard Black-Scholes market describes the liquid part of the
investment the illiquid asset is sold at a random moment with prescribed
liquidation time distribution. In the moment of liquidation it generates
additional liquid wealth dependent on illiquid assets paper value. The investor
has the logarithmic utility function as a limit case of a HARA-type utility.
Different distributions of the liquidation time of the illiquid asset are under
consideration - a classical exponential distribution and Weibull distribution
that is more practically relevant. Under certain conditions we show the
existence of the viscosity solution in both cases. Applying numerical methods
we compare classical Merton's strategies and the optimal consumption-allocation
strategies for portfolios with different liquidation-time distributions of an
illiquid asset.

find that this probability behaves for large $N$ as
$\mathcal{P}[\lambda_{(k)}=x]\approx \exp\left(-\beta N^2 \psi(k/N,x)\right)$,

the observed properties of V513 Cas and IW And, provided they are followed by a

regimes of quasi-spherical accretion onto a NS: supersonic (Bondi) accretion,
which takes place when the captured matter cools down rapidly and falls
supersonically towards the NS magnetosphere, and subsonic (settling) accretion
which occurs when the plasma remains hot until it meets the magnetospheric
boundary. The two regimes are separated by a limit in X-ray luminosity at about
4 10^{36} erg/s. In subsonic accretion, which works a hot quasi-spherical shell
must form around the magnetosphere, and the actual accretion rate onto the NS
is determined by the ability of the plasma to enter the magnetosphere due to
the Rayleigh-Taylor instability. Two regimes of subsonic accretion are
possible, depending on the plasma cooling mechanism (Compton or radiative) near
the magnetopshere. The transition from the high-luminosity regime with Compton
cooling to the low-luminosity (L_x < 3\times 10^35 erg/s) regime with radiative
cooling can be responsible for the onset of the 'off' states repeatedly
observed in several X-ray pulsars, such as Vela X-1, GX 301-2 and 4U 1907+09.
The triggering of the transition may be due to a switch in the X-ray beam
pattern in response to a change in the optical depth in the accretion column
with changing luminosity. We also show that in the settling accretion theory,
bright X-ray flares (10^{38}-10^{40} ergs) observed in SFXT may be produced by
sporadic capture of magnetized stellar-wind plasma. At sufficiently low
accretion rates, magnetic reconnection can enhance the magnetospheric plasma
entry rate, resulting in copious production of X-ray photons, strong Compton
cooling and ultimately in unstable accretion of the entire shell. A bright
flare develops on the free-fall time scale in the shell, and the typical energy
released in an SFXT bright flare corresponds to the mass of the shell.

quasi-components of X. If Y satisfies weak algebraic conditions with a single
binary operation then a stable set of functions forms an object generalizing an
ideal of a ring. Calling such sets ideals there is a concept of a prime ideal.
The ideal of functions vanishing on a quasi-component are prime ideals of
C(X,Y). If Y has a zero set that is open then these prime ideals are min- max
implying that when Y is a ring all of the prime ideals of C(X,Y) are of this
form and min-max. However this is a study of C(X,Y) and its ideals beginning
with a few algebraic hypothesis on Y and adding to them as needed. So there are
conditions when a prime ideal is minimal, when the set of quasi-components is
in bijective correspondence with the set of prime ideals of functions which
vanish on them, when C(X,Y) can not be like a local ring, when the prime (nil)
radical is trivial, and when the corresponding Spec(C(X,Y)) is a disconnected
topological space. Example of results are; if a quasi-component of x is open
then the prime ideal of functions vanishing on it is minimal independent of the
zero set of Y being open; if the zero set of Y is open then the set of all
ideals of functions vanishing on quasi-components is the set of minimal prime
ideals irrespective of any quasi-component being open in X. These results imply
the same for the ideals of the ring C(X,Y) when Y is a ring. The techniques
developed give a method of generating unlimited number of rings with prescribed

Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS), THEMIS (Tenerife), the Hinode Solar Optical
Telescope (SOT), the Solar Dynamic Observatory Atmospheric Imaging Assembly

the Meudon Solar Tower. Aims. The aim of this work is to study the dynamics of
the prominence fine structures in multiple wavelengths to understand their
formation. Methods. The spectrographs IRIS and MSDP provided line profiles with
a high cadence in Mg II and in Halpha lines. Results. The magnetic field is
found to be globally horizontal with a relatively weak field strength (8-15
Gauss). The Ca II movie reveals turbulent-like motion that is not organized in
specific parts of the prominence. On the other hand, the Mg II line profiles
show multiple peaks well separated in wavelength. Each peak corresponds to a
Gaussian profile, and not to a reversed profile as was expected by the present
non-LTE radiative transfer modeling. Conclusions. Turbulent fields on top of
the macroscopic horizontal component of the magnetic field supporting the
prominence give rise to the complex dynamics of the plasma. The plasma with the
high velocities (70 km/s to 100 km/s if we take into account the transverse
velocities) may correspond to condensation of plasma along more or less
horizontal threads of the arch-shape structure visible in 304 A. The steady
flows (5 km/s) would correspond to a more quiescent plasma (cool and
prominence-corona transition region) of the prominence packed into dips in
horizontal magnetic field lines. The very weak secondary peaks in the Mg II
profiles may reflect the turbulent nature of parts of the prominence.

gives a noncontractible family of compactly-supported symplectomorphisms. In
particular, we find examples: where the Dehn twist along a parametrised
Lagrangian sphere depends up to Hamiltonian isotopy on its parametrisation;
where the symplectomorphism group is not simply-connected, and where the
symplectomorphism group does not have the homotopy-type of a finite CW-complex.
We show that these phenomena persist for Dehn twists along the standard
matching spheres of the $A_m$-Milnor fibre. The nontriviality is detected by
considering the action of symplectomorphisms on the space of parametrised
Lagrangian submanifolds. We find related examples of symplectic mapping classes
for $T^*(S^n\times S^1)$ and of an exotic symplectic structure on
$T^*(S^n\times S^1)$ standard at infinity.

  Lower bounds for the depth","25 pages, 4 figures",,,,"cs.LO cs.DC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Given a connected graph $G$ and its vertex $x$, let $U_x(G)$ denote the
universal cover of $G$ obtained by unfolding $G$ into a tree starting from $x$.
Let $T=T(n)$ be the minimum number such that, for graphs $G$ and $H$ with at
most $n$ vertices each, the isomorphism of $U_x(G)$ and $U_y(H)$ surely follows
from the isomorphism of these rooted trees truncated at depth $T$. Motivated by
applications in theory of distributed computing, Norris [Discrete Appl. Math.
1995] asks if $T(n)\le n$. We answer this question in the negative by
establishing that $T(n)=(2-o(1))n$. Our solution uses basic tools of finite
model theory such as a bisimulation version of the Immerman-Lander 2-pebble
counting game.
  The graphs $G_n$ and $H_n$ we construct to prove the lower bound for $T(n)$
also show some other tight lower bounds. Both having $n$ vertices, $G_n$ and
$H_n$ can be distinguished in 2-variable counting logic only with quantifier
depth $(1-o(1))n$. It follows that color refinement, the classical procedure
used in isomorphism testing and other areas for computing the coarsest
equitable partition of a graph, needs $(1-o(1))n$ rounds to achieve color
stabilization on each of $G_n$ and $H_n$. Somewhat surprisingly, this number of
rounds is not enough for color stabilization on the disjoint union of $G_n$ and
$H_n$, where $(2-o(1))n$ rounds are needed.

Compared to sunspots, starspots can be bigger or cover a larger fraction of the
stellar surface. While sunspots appear only at low latitudes, starspots are
also found in polar regions, in particular on rapidly rotating stars. Sunspots
are believed to result from the eruption of magnetic flux-tubes rising from the
deep interior of the Sun. The strong magnetic field locally reduces convective
heat transport to the solar surface. Such flux-tube models have also been
invoked to explain starspot properties. However, these models use several
simplifications and so far the generation of either sunspots or starspots has
not been demonstrated in a self-consistent simulation of stellar magnetic
convection. Here we show that direct numerical simulations of a distributed
dynamo operating in a density-stratified rotating spherical shell can
spontaneously generate cool spots. Convection in the interior of the model
produces a large scale magnetic field which interacts with near surface
granular convection leading to strong concentrations of magnetic flux and
formation of starspots. Prerequisites for the formation of sizeable
high-latitude spots in the model are sufficiently strong density stratification
and rapid rotation. Our model presents an alternate mechanism for starspot
formation by distributed dynamo action.

tomography (PET) images makes denoising process an inevitable step prior to
qualitative and quantitative image analysis tasks. Conventional PET denoising
methods either over-smooth small-sized structures due to resolution limitation
or make incorrect assumptions about the noise characteristics. Therefore,
clinically important quantitative information may be corrupted. To address
these challenges, we introduced a novel approach to remove signal-dependent
noise in the PET images where the noise distribution was considered as
Poisson-Gaussian mixed. Meanwhile, the generalized Anscombe's transformation
(GAT) was used to stabilize varying nature of the PET noise. Other than noise
stabilization, it is also desirable for the noise removal filter to preserve
the boundaries of the structures while smoothing the noisy regions. Indeed, it
is important to avoid significant loss of quantitative information such as
standard uptake value (SUV)-based metrics as well as metabolic lesion volume.
To satisfy all these properties, we extended bilateral filtering method into
trilateral filtering through multiscaling and optimal Gaussianization process.
The proposed method was tested on more than 50 PET-CT images from various
patients having different cancers and achieved the superior performance
compared to the widely used denoising techniques in the literature.

across a damaged region, above their melting temperature. Using molecular
dynamics simulations we probe the healing of polymer films and compare the
results with those for thermal welding of homopolymer slabs. The two processes
differ in their interfacial structure since damage leads to increased
polydispersity and more short chains. A polymer sample was cut into two
separate films that were then held together in the melt state. The recovery of
the damaged film was followed as time elapsed and polymer molecules diffused
across the interface. The mass uptake and formation of entanglements, as
obtained from primitive path analysis, are extracted and correlated with the
interfacial strength obtained from shear simulations. We find that the
interdiffusion is significantly faster in the damaged film compared to welding
because of the presence of short chains. Though interfacial entanglements
increase more rapidly for the damaged films, a large fraction of them are near
chain ends. As a result, the interfacial strength of the healing film increases
more slowly than for welding. For both healing and welding, the interfacial
strength saturates as the bulk entanglement density is recovered across the
interface. However, the saturation strength of the damaged film is below the
bulk strength for the polymer sample. At saturation, cut chains remain near the
healing interface. They are less entangled and thus mechanically weaken the
interface. When the interfacial strength saturates, the number of interfacial
entanglements scales with the corresponding bulk entanglement density. Chain
stiffness increases the density of entanglements, which increases the
interfacial strength. Our results show that a few entanglements across the
interface are sufficient to resist interfacial chain pullout and enhance the
mechanical strength.

possibilities. Credit risk warehousing increases capital requirements and
leaves open risk. Open risk must be priced in the physical measure, rather than
the risk neutral measure, and implies profits and losses. Furthermore the rate
of return on capital that shareholders require must be paid from profits.
Profits are taxable and losses provide tax credits. Here we extend the
semi-replication approach of Burgard and Kjaer (2013) and the capital formalism
(KVA) of Green, Kenyon, and Dennis (2014) to cover credit risk warehousing and
tax, formalized as double-semi-replication and TVA (Tax Valuation Adjustment)

  MOND issue of the Canadian Journal of Physics",,"10.1139/cjp-2014-0170",,"astro-ph.GA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Tests of MOND in ellipticals are relatively rare because these galaxies often
lack kinematic tracers in the regions where the MOND effects are significant.
Stellar shells observed in many elliptical galaxies offer a promising way to
constrain their gravitational field. Shells appear as glowing arcs around their
host galaxy. They are observed up to ~100 kpc. The stars in axially symmetric
shell systems move in nearly radial orbits. The radial distributions of shell
locations and the spectra of stars in shells can be used to constrain the
gravitational potential of their host galaxy. The symmetrical shell systems,
being especially suitable for these studies, occur in approximately 3% of all
early-type galaxies. Hence the shells substantially increase the number of
ellipticals in which MOND can be tested up to large radii. In this paper, we
review our work on shell galaxies in MOND. We summarize the paper B\'{i}lek et
al. (2013), where we demonstrated the consistency of shell radii in an
elliptical NGC 3923 with MOND, and the work B\'{i}lek et al. (2014), in which
we predicted a giant (~200 kpc), as yet undiscovered shell of NGC 3923. We
explain the shell identification method, which was used in these two papers. We
further describe the expected shape of line profiles in shell spectra in MOND
which is very special due to the direct relation of the gravitational field and
baryonic matter distribution (B\'{i}lek et al., 2014, in preparation).

concern the resolution of such problems of tachyon theory as the causality
violation by tachyons, the stability of the tachyon vacuum, and the stability
of ordinary particles against the spontaneous emission of tachyons, i.e. the
problems which are generally used as arguments against the possibility of such
particles. It is demonstrated that all these arguments contain nontrivial
loopholes which undermine their validity. A demand for a consistent tachyon
theory is formulated, and several ideas for its construction are suggested.

dynamics. When it is implemented into a legged robot's locomotion control as a
central pattern generator (CPG), sophisticated gait patterns arise so that the
robot can perform various walking behaviors. However, such a single chaotic CPG
controller has difficulties dealing with leg malfunction. Specifically, in the
scenarios presented here, its movement permanently deviates from the desired
trajectory. To address this problem, we extend the single chaotic CPG to
multiple CPGs with learning. The learning mechanism is based on a simulated
annealing algorithm. In a normal situation, the CPGs synchronize and their
dynamics are identical. With leg malfunction or disability, the CPGs lose
synchronization leading to independent dynamics. In this case, the learning
mechanism is applied to automatically adjust the remaining legs' oscillation
frequencies so that the robot adapts its locomotion to deal with the
malfunction. As a consequence, the trajectory produced by the multiple chaotic
CPGs resembles the original trajectory far better than the one produced by only
a single CPG. The performance of the system is evaluated first in a physical
simulation of a quadruped as well as a hexapod robot and finally in a real
six-legged walking machine called AMOSII. The experimental results presented
here reveal that using multiple CPGs with learning is an effective approach for
adaptive locomotion generation where, for instance, different body parts have
to perform independent movements for malfunction compensation.

Compared with the standard methodology that tends to underestimate remaining
oil reserves, our method gives a better description of future oil production,
as validated by our back-tests starting in 2008. Specifically, we predict
remaining reserves extractable until 2030 to be 188 +/- 10 million barrels for
