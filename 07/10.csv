simultaneously (200, 350 and 450 microns). A preliminary version of the
instrument equipped with the 350 microns focal plane, has been successfully
installed and tested on APEX telescope in Chile during the 2013 and 2014
austral winters. This instrument is developed by CEA (Saclay and Grenoble,
France), IAS (France) and University of Manchester (UK) in collaboration with
ESO. We introduce the mechanical and optical design, as well as the cryogenics
and electronics of the ArTeMiS camera. ArTeMiS detectors are similar to the
ones developed for the Herschel PACS photometer but they are adapted to the
high optical load encountered at APEX site. Ultimately, ArTeMiS will contain 4
sub-arrays at 200 microns and 2x8 sub-arrays at 350 and 450 microns. We show
preliminary lab measurements like the responsivity of the instrument to hot and
cold loads illumination and NEP calculation. Details on the on-sky
commissioning runs made in 2013 and 2014 at APEX are shown. We used planets
(Mars, Saturn, Uranus) to determine the flat-field and to get the flux
calibration. A pointing model was established in the first days of the runs.
The average relative pointing accuracy is 3 arcsec. The beam at 350 microns has
been estimated to be 8.5 arcsec, which is in good agreement with the beam of
the 12 m APEX dish. Several observing modes have been tested, like On-The-Fly
for beam-maps or large maps, spirals or raster of spirals for compact sources.
With this preliminary version of ArTeMiS, we concluded that the mapping speed
is already more than 5 times better than the previous 350 microns instrument at
APEX. The median NEFD at 350 microns is 600 mJy.s1/2, with best values at 300
mJy.s1/2. The complete instrument with 5760 pixels and optimized settings will
be installed during the first half of 2015.

limited to systems with a low number of states, since the transition matrices
involved pose considerable challenges as their size and their density increase.
Big, dense transition matrices may easily defy both the computer's memory and
the scientists' ability to interpret them, due to the very high amount of
information they contain; yet approximations using other types of models are
not always the best solution.
  We propose a set of methods to overcome the difficulties associated with big,
dense Markov chain transition matrices. Using a population genetic model as an
example, we demonstrate how big matrices can be transformed into clear and
easily interpretable graphs with the help of network analysis. Moreover, we
describe an algorithm to save computer memory by substituting the original
matrix with a sparse approximate while preserving all its mathematically
important properties. In the same model example, we manage to store about 90%
less data while keeping more than 99% of the information contained in the
matrix and a closely corresponding dominant eigenvector.
  Our approach is an example how numerical limitations for the number of states
in a Markov chain can be overcome. By facilitating the use of state-rich Markov
chain models, they may become a valuable supplement to the diversity of models
currently employed in biology.

spectra of a wide range of hydrous minerals and phases, we estimate a
model-dependent water content of 4\pm 1 wt. \% in the equatorial and
mid-latitudes. Surface hydration increases with latitude, with an asymmetry in
water content between the northern and southern hemispheres. The surface
hydration is compared to various parameters (albedo, dust, geological units,
time, relative humidity, atmospheric water pressure, and in situ measurements
performed by Phoenix and Curiosity) to constrain the nature of the reservoir.
We conclude that the nature of the surface hydration of the Martian low

diffusion, only recently has the subdiffusive motion been associated with
nonergodic behavior. These findings have stimulated new questions for their
implications in statistical mechanics and cell biology. Is nonergodicity a
common strategy shared by living systems? Which physical mechanisms generate
it? What are its implications for biological function? Here, we use single
particle tracking to demonstrate that the motion of DC-SIGN, a receptor with
unique pathogen recognition capabilities, reveals nonergodic subdiffusion on
living cell membranes. In contrast to previous studies, this behavior is
incompatible with transient immobilization and therefore it can not be
interpreted according to continuous time random walk theory. We show that the
receptor undergoes changes of diffusivity, consistent with the current view of
the cell membrane as a highly dynamic and diverse environment. Simulations
based on a model of ordinary random walk in complex media quantitatively
reproduce all our observations, pointing toward diffusion heterogeneity as the
cause of DC-SIGN behavior. By studying different receptor mutants, we further
correlate receptor motion to its molecular structure, thus establishing a
strong link between nonergodicity and biological function. These results
underscore the role of disorder in cell membranes and its connection with
function regulation. Due to its generality, our approach offers a framework to
interpret anomalous transport in other complex media where dynamic
heterogeneity might play a major role, such as those found, e.g., in soft
condensed matter, geology and ecology.

significantly advance in the understanding of the QGP phase. We also predict
that $(\eta/s)/(\sigma_{el}/T)$, independently on the running coupling
$\alpha_s(T)$, should increase up to about $\sim 20$ for $T \rightarrow T_c$,

anonymous agents. Each agent supports an initial opinion or color. We assume
that at the onset, the number of agents supporting the plurality color exceeds
that of the agents supporting any other color by a sufficiently-large bias. The
goal is to provide a protocol that, with high probability, brings the system
into the configuration in which all agents support the (initial) plurality
color. We consider the Undecided-State Dynamics, a well-known protocol which
uses just one more state (the undecided one) than those necessary to store
colors. We show that the speed of convergence of this protocol depends on the
initial color configuration as a whole, not just on the gap between the
plurality and the second largest color community. This dependence is best
captured by a novel notion we introduce, namely, the monochromatic distance
${md}(\bar{\mathbf{c}})$ which measures the distance of the initial color
configuration $\bar{ \mathbf {c}}$ from the closest monochromatic one. In the
complete graph, we prove that, for a wide range of the input parameters, this
dynamics converges within $O({md}(\bar {\mathbf {c}}) \log {n})$ rounds. We
prove that this upper bound is almost tight in the strong sense: Starting from
any color configuration $\bar {\mathbf {c}}$, the convergence time is
$\Omega({md}(\bar {\mathbf {c}}))$. Finally, we adapt the Undecided-State
Dynamics to obtain a fast, random walk-based protocol for plurality consensus
on regular expanders. This protocol converges in $O({md}(\bar {\mathbf {c}})
\mathrm{polylog}(n))$ rounds using only $\mathrm{polylog}(n)$ local memory. A
key-ingredient to achieve the above bounds is a new analysis of the maximum
node congestion that results from performing $n$ parallel random walks on
regular expanders. All our bounds hold with high probability.

enriched in carbon, very poor in nitrogen, and the ices from which they
originally formed might had deuterium-to-hydrogen ratios lower than the
predicted cometary value, unexplained properties observed in no other planets.
Here we show that all these properties can be explained naturally if Uranus and
Neptune both formed at the carbon monoxide iceline. Due to the diffusive
redistribution of vapors, this outer region of the protosolar nebula
intrinsically has enough surface density to form both planets from carbon-rich
solids but nitrogen-depleted gas, in abundances consistent with their observed
values. Water rich interiors originating mostly from transformed CO ices
reconcile the D/H value of Uranus and Neptune's building blocks with the
cometary value. Finally, Our scenario generalizes a well known hypothesis that
Jupiter formed on an iceline (water snowline) for the two ice giants, and might
be a first step towards generalizing this mechanism for other giant planets.

reactions at metal surfaces. The Somorjai group in Nano. Lett. {\bf 9}, 3930
(2009) has reported a chemicurrent, a flux of charge carriers in response to
$\mathrm{H_2}$ oxidation by $\mathrm{O_2}$ into $\mathrm{H_2O}$ over a platinum
surface. The nature of the chemicurrent has been debated in the literature;
explanations both extrinsic and intrinsic to the reaction mechanism have been
offered. This article suggests a picture behind the chemicurrent experiments,
which is intrinsic to the mechanism of hydrogen oxidation in a high temperature
regime. Surface reaction intermediates, $""\mathrm{O^-}""$, $""\mathrm{H^-}""$,
$""\mathrm{OH^-}""$, are negatively charged while the product, $\mathrm{H_2O}$,
and reactants, $\mathrm{H_2}$ and $\mathrm{O_2}$, are neutral. Hence, charge
transfers between the metal and reacting species are inevitable. After
electrons are transferred from the metal to the interface in dissociative
oxygen and hydrogen adsorption, translationally excited electrons in the metal
arise in part as a result of decay of negatively charged transition states in
reaction steps connecting surface species of different charges,
$""\mathrm{O^-+H^-}"" \rightleftarrows ""\mathrm{2 e+OH^-}""$ and
$""\mathrm{OH^-+H^-}""\rightleftarrows ""\mathrm{2 e+H_2O}""$. These transition
states are the lowest energy configurations possible for changing the charge of
the negatively charged surface intermediates. In particular, the transition
state for $""\mathrm{O^-+H^-}"" \rightleftarrows \mathrm{""2 e+OH^-""}$ limits the
reaction rate. These processes may contribute to the chemicurrent. This picture
should also apply to other catalytic chemical reactions on metal surfaces that
proceed through formation of charged surface intermediates and their consequent
discharge into the metal.

$t$, $1\le t\le n$, ball $t$ picks a node of $G$ uniformly at random and
performs a non-backtracking random walk of length $l$ from the chosen node.Then
it allocates itself on one of the visited nodes with minimum load (ties are

$G$ has girth at least $\omega(l)$, then the maximum load attained by the

value generated from a match between a pair of agents is the sum of the two

modern theoretical framework for its implementation is Wilson's operator
product expansion (OPE), supplemented by analytic extrapolation from large
Euclidean momenta, where the OPE is defined, to the Minkowski axis, where
observable quantities are defined. Recently, the importance of additional terms
in the expansion of QCD correlators near the Minkowski axis, responsible for
quark-hadron duality violations (DVs), was emphasized. In this paper we
introduce a mathematical tool that might be useful for the study of DVs in QCD.
It is based on finding the minimal distance, measured in the $L^\infty$ norm
along a contour in the complex momentum plane, between a class of admissible
functions containing the physical amplitude and the asymptotic expansion
predicted by the OPE. This minimal distance is given by the norm of a Hankel
matrix that can be calculated exactly, using as input the experimental spectral
function on a finite interval of the timelike axis. We also comment on the
relation between the new functional tool and the more commonly used
$\chi^2$-based analysis. The approach is illustrated on a toy model for the QCD

cosmic microwave background (CMB) polarimeter designed to search for evidence
of inflation by measuring the large-angular scale CMB polarization signal.
BICEP2 recently reported a detection of B-mode power corresponding to the
tensor-to-scalar ratio r = 0.2 on ~2 degree scales. If the BICEP2 signal is
caused by inflationary gravitational waves (IGWs), then there should be a
corresponding increase in B-mode power on angular scales larger than 18
degrees. PIPER is currently the only suborbital instrument capable of fully
testing and extending the BICEP2 results by measuring the B-mode power spectrum
on angular scales $\theta$ = ~0.6 deg to 90 deg, covering both the reionization
bump and recombination peak, with sensitivity to measure the tensor-to-scalar
ratio down to r = 0.007, and four frequency bands to distinguish foregrounds.
PIPER will accomplish this by mapping 85% of the sky in four frequency bands
(200, 270, 350, 600 GHz) over a series of 8 conventional balloon flights from
the northern and southern hemispheres. The instrument has background-limited
sensitivity provided by fully cryogenic (1.5 K) optics focusing the sky signal
onto four 32x40-pixel arrays of time-domain multiplexed Transition-Edge Sensor
(TES) bolometers held at 140 mK. Polarization sensitivity and systematic
control are provided by front-end Variable-delay Polarization Modulators
(VPMs), which rapidly modulate only the polarized sky signal at 3 Hz and allow
PIPER to instantaneously measure the full Stokes vector (I, Q, U, V) for each
pointing. We describe the PIPER instrument and progress towards its first
flight.

to be highly aspherical. To date, it has been unclear whether GRB-SNe could be
used as standardizable candles, with contrasting conclusions found by different

relation exists between the brightness and width of their decomposed light
curves relative to a template supernova. Every single nearby spectroscopically
identified GRB-SN, for which the rest-frame and host contributions have been
accurately determined, follows this relation. Additionally, it is shown that
not only GRB-SNe, but perhaps all supernovae whose explosion is powered by a
central engine, may eventually be used as a standardizable candle. Finally, I
suggest that the use of GRB-SNe as standardizable candles likely arises from
from a combination of the viewing angle and similar explosion geometry in each
event, the latter which is influenced by the explosion mechanism of GRB-SNe.

the RTTP phenomenon is polar CMEs, which are shown to be similar to the
low-latitude CMEs. This similarity is important because it provides important

such as follow up of patients with tumors and therapy response assessment. In
this paper, the authors show an approach to utilize former scans of the patient
for the acceleration of repeated MRI scans.
  Methods: The proposed approach utilizes the possible similarity of the
repeated scans in longitudinal MRI studies. Since similarity is not guaranteed,
sampling and reconstruction are adjusted during acquisition to match the actual
similarity between the scans. The baseline MR scan is utilized both in the
sampling stage, via adaptive sampling, and in the reconstruction stage, with
weighted reconstruction. In adaptive sampling, k-space sampling locations are
optimized during acquisition. Weighted reconstruction uses the locations of the
nonzero coefficients in the sparse domains as a prior in the recovery process.
The approach was tested on 2D and 3D MRI scans of patients with brain tumors.
  Results: The longitudinal adaptive CS MRI (LACS-MRI) scheme provides
reconstruction quality which outperforms other CS-based approaches for rapid
MRI. Examples are shown on patients with brain tumors and demonstrate improved
spatial resolution. Compared with data sampled at Nyquist rate, LACS-MRI
exhibits Signal-to-Error Ratio (SER) of 24.8dB with undersampling factor of
16.6 in 3D MRI.
  Conclusions: The authors have presented a novel method for image
reconstruction utilizing similarity of scans in longitudinal MRI studies, where
possible. The proposed approach can play a major part and significantly reduce
scanning time in many applications that consist of disease follow-up and
monitoring of longitudinal changes in brain MRI.

  Electronics, June 1, 2014",,,,"cond-mat.supr-con physics.optics quant-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A single photon is well known to have spin S = hbar, which would correspond
to circular polarization, and all quantum transitions with photon absorption or
emission correspond to DeltaS = +/-hbar. However, it is also widely believed
that a single photon may be linearly polarized, which would correspond to a
state with S = 0. Indeed, linearly polarized single photons are central to most
quantum entanglement experiments. On the contrary, it has recently been
suggested (based on a realistic spin-quantized wave picture of quantum states)
that a linearly polarized photon state must be a superposition of a pair of
circularly polarized photons, each with S = +/-hbar. This question cannot be
resolved using a conventional photon detector, which generally cannot
distinguish one photon from two simultaneous photons. However, it can be
addressed using a superconducting microcalorimeter detector with sub-eV energy
resolution and high quantum efficiency (QE). A careful experiment demonstrating
this photon pairing could place in question some of the paradoxical central
foundations of modern quantum theory, including quantum entanglement and
nonlocality.

between traditional dark-matter models and models with non-minimal dark sectors
--- including models of Dynamical Dark Matter (DDM) --- at hadron colliders.
For concreteness, we focus on events with two hadronic jets and large missing
transverse energy at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). As we discuss, simple
""bump-hunting"" searches are not sufficient; probing non-minimal dark sectors
typically requires an analysis of the actual shapes of the distributions of
relevant kinematic variables. We therefore begin by identifying those kinematic
variables whose distributions are particularly suited to this task. However, as
we demonstrate, this then leads to a number of additional subtleties, since
cuts imposed on the data for the purpose of background reduction can at the
same time have the unintended consequence of distorting these distributions in
unexpected ways, thereby obscuring signals of new physics. We therefore proceed
to study the correlations between several of the most popular relevant
kinematic variables currently on the market, and investigate how imposing cuts
on one or more of these variables can impact the distributions of others.
Finally, we combine our results in order to assess the prospects for
distinguishing non-minimal dark sectors in this channel at the upgraded LHC.

gauge bosons from neutrinos, making them partly visible objects. The presence
of collinear EW radiation allows for the full reconstruction of neutrinos under
certain circumstances. We also show that the presence of EW radiation allows
one to distinguish the $SU(2)$ quantum numbers of various new physics
particles. We consider examples of two completely different new physics
paradigms, additional gauge groups and SUSY, where the bremsstrahlung radiation
of $W$ and $Z$ from $W'$s, $Z'$s or stops allows one to determine the couplings

Consequently, the scientific community needs automatic procedures to derive

  Aims. Based on the widely known SPECTRUM code by R. O. Gray, we developed an
integrated spectroscopic software framework suitable for the determination of
atmospheric parameters (i.e., effective temperature, surface gravity,
metallicity) and individual chemical abundances. The code, named iSpec and
freely distributed, is written mainly in Python and can be used on different
platforms.
  Methods. iSpec can derive atmospheric parameters by using the synthetic
spectral fitting technique and the equivalent width method. We validated the
performance of both approaches by developing two different pipelines and
analyzing the Gaia FGK benchmark stars spectral library. The analysis was
complemented with several tests designed to assess other aspects, such as the
interpolation of model atmospheres and the performance with lower quality
spectra.
  Results. We provide a code ready to perform automatic stellar spectral
analysis. We successfully assessed the results obtained for FGK stars with
high-resolution and high signal-to-noise spectra.

orbit in a vast polar structure (VPOS), which also contains globular clusters,

several other host galaxies. We test whether recently discovered objects in the
MW halo, the satellite galaxy/globular cluster transition object named PSO
J174.0675-10.8774 or Crater and three stellar streams, are part of the VPOS.
Crater is situated close to the VPOS. Incorporating the new object in the
VPOS-plane fit slightly improves the alignment of the plane with other features
such as the Magellanic stream and the average orbital plane of the satellites
co-orbiting in the VPOS. We predict Crater's proper motion by assuming that it,
too, orbits in the VPOS. One of the three streams aligns well with the VPOS.
Surprisingly, it appears to lie in the exact same orbital plane as the Palomar
5 stream and shares its distance, suggesting a direct connection between the
two. The stream also crosses close to the Fornax dwarf galaxy and is oriented
approximately along the galaxy's direction of motion. The two other streams
cannot align closely with the VPOS because they were discovered in the
direction of M31/M33, which is outside of the satellite structure. The VPOS
thus attains two new members. This further emphasizes that the highly
anisotropic and correlated distribution of satellite objects requires an
explanation beyond the suggestion that the MW satellite system is an extreme
statistical outlier of a $\Lambda$CDM sub-halo system.

most prominently by measurements in the solar wind and high resolution

be steeper than perpendicular spectrum, typically $k^{-2}$, consistent with the

into the nature of the relation between parallel and perpendicular spectra and
argue that this $k^{-2}$ scaling has the same origin as the $\omega^{-2}$
scaling of Lagrangian frequency spectrum in strong hydrodynamic turbulence.
This follows from the fact that Alfv\'en waves propagate along magnetic field
lines. It is now became clear that the observed anisotropy can be argued
without invocation of the ""critical balance"" argument and is more robust that
was previously thought. The relation between parallel (Lagrangian) and
perpendicular (Eulerian) spectra is inevitable consequence of strong turbulence
of Alfven waves, rather than a conjecture based on the uncertainty relation. I
tested this using high-resolution simulations of MHD turbulence, in particular
I verified that the cutoff of the parallel spectrum scales as Kolmogorov
timescale, not lengthscale.

mergers falls short by a factor of 10 of the cumulative accretion mass for
galaxies in the overdense regions, and by a factor of 5 in the normal

lies below that of an in-situ star formation (SF) rate. The fraction of stellar
masses in galaxies contributed by mergers in overdense regions is ~12%, and
~33% in the normal regions, at these redshifts. Our median SF rates for ~few X
10^9 Mo galaxies agrees well with the recently estimated rates for z ~ 7
galaxies from Spitzer's SURF-UP survey. Finally, we find that the main
difference between the normal and overdense regions lies in the amplified
growth of massive galaxies in massive dark matter halos. This leads to the
formation of >= 10^{10} Mo galaxies due to the ~100-fold increase in mass

multiple regular and irregular moons. Regular moons revolve around their host
planet in circular, low inclination short period orbits, and are thought to
form in-situ through coagulation processes. In contrast, irregular moons have
highly inclined (and even retrograde), typically eccentric and long period
orbits around their host planet. Irregular moons are therefore often thought to
be unbound objects in helio-centric orbits that were later captured to their
current orbits around the planet. Here we study the a different possibility in
which regular moons form in-situ, and dynamically evolve through mutual
moon-moon scattering. We find that such evolution can excite the satellites
into high eccentricities and inclinations. We find that moons are either
ejected from the host planet to become runaway moons, or stay bound and become
prograde orbiting irregular moons with inclined and eccentric orbits around
their host planet. Ejected moons, unbound to the planet, can later be
temporarily re-captured by the host planet even at retrograde orbits. Such
moons are eventually re-ejected from the system or collide with the planet, at
least in the absence of dissipative processes (e.g. collisions with existing
bound moons, a debris disk or through tidal interactions with the host planet),
not currently modeled. Uncaptured runaway moons may eventually be ejected from
the Solar system, or be captured into stable helio-centric orbits and
contribute to the populations of asteroidal or trans-Neptunian objects. Such
scenarios are potentially relevant both for the gas-giant satellites in the

spectra of scalar and tensor modes to probe the nature of inflation. We focus
on the leading modification to the slow-roll dynamics, which entails a sound
speed $c_s$ for the scalar fluctuations. We derive analytically a lower bound
on $c_s$ in terms of a given tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$, taking into account
the difference in the freeze-out times between the scalar and tensor modes. We
find that any detection of primordial B-modes with $r > 0.01$ implies a lower
bound on $c_s$ that is stronger than the bound derived from the absence of
non-Gaussianity in the Planck data. For $r \gtrsim 0.1$, the bound would be
tantalizingly close to a critical value for the sound speed, $(c_s)_\star =
0.47$ (corresponding to $(f_{\rm NL}^{\rm equil})_\star = -0.93$), which we
show serves as a threshold for non-trivial dynamics beyond slow-roll. We also
discuss how an order-one level of equilateral non-Gaussianity is a natural
observational target for other extensions of the canonical paradigm.

fluxes from the planetary surface in excess of those that could be produced
abiotically. Here, we use an altitude-dependent photochemical model with the
enhanced lower boundary conditions necessary to carefully explore abiotic O_2
and O_3 production on lifeless planets with a wide variety of volcanic gas
fluxes and stellar energy distributions. On some of these worlds, we predict
limited O_2 and O_3 build up, caused by fast chemical production of these
gases. This results in detectable abiotic O_3 and CH_4 features in the
UV-visible, but no detectable abiotic O_2 features. Thus, simultaneous
detection of O_3 and CH_4 by a UV-visible mission is not a strong biosignature
without proper contextual information. Discrimination between biological and
abiotic sources of O_2 and O_3 is possible through analysis of the stellar and
atmospheric context - particularly redox state and O atom inventory - of the
planet in question. Specifically, understanding the spectral characteristics of
the star and obtaining a broad wavelength range for planetary spectra should
allow more robust identification of false positives for life. This highlights
the importance of wide spectral coverage for future exoplanet characterization
missions. Specifically, discrimination between true- and false-positives may
require spectral observations that extend into infrared wavelengths, and
provide contextual information on the planet's atmospheric chemistry.

self-interference at the BS and co-channel interference among users. Hence, we
consider a joint beamformer design to maximize the spectral efficiency subject
to certain power constraints. The design problem is first formulated as a
rank-constrained optimization one, and the rank relaxation method is then
applied. However the relaxed problem is still nonconvex, and thus optimal
solutions are hard to find. Herein, we propose two provably convergent
algorithms to obtain suboptimal solutions. Based on the concept of the
difference of convex functions programming, we approximate the design problem
by a determinant maximization program in each iteration of the first algorithm.
The second method is built upon the sequential parametric convex approximation
method, which allows us to transform the relaxed problem into a semidefinite
program in each iteration. Extensive numerical experiments under small cell
setups illustrate that the full-duplex system with the proposed algorithms can
achieve a large gain over the half-duplex one.

methods to quantify dental biofilm coverage have recently been reported in the
literature, but at best they provide a semi-automated approach to
quantification with significant input from a human grader that comes with the
graders bias of what are foreground, background, biofilm, and tooth.
Additionally, human assessment indices limit the resolution of the
quantification scale; most commercial scales use five levels of quantification
for biofilm coverage (0%, 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100%). On the other hand, current
state-of-the-art techniques in automatic plaque quantification fail to make
their way into practical applications owing to their inability to incorporate
human input to handle misclassifications. This paper proposes a new interactive
method for biofilm quantification in Quantitative light-induced fluorescence
(QLF) images of canine teeth that is independent of the perceptual bias of the
grader. The method partitions a QLF image into segments of uniform texture and
intensity called superpixels; every superpixel is statistically modeled as a
realization of a single 2D Gaussian Markov random field (GMRF) whose parameters
are estimated; the superpixel is then assigned to one of three classes
(background, biofilm, tooth substratum) based on the training set of data. The
quantification results show a high degree of consistency and precision. At the
same time, the proposed method gives pathologists full control to post-process
the automatic quantification by flipping misclassified superpixels to a
different state (background, tooth, biofilm) with a single click, providing
greater usability than simply marking the boundaries of biofilm and tooth as
done by current state-of-the-art methods.

However, implementation and theoretical analysis of the Kiefer-Wolfowitz NPMLE
are notoriously difficult. A fast algorithm was recently proposed that makes
NPMLE-based procedures feasible for use in large-scale problems, but the
algorithm calculates only an approximation to the NPMLE. In this paper we make
two contributions. First, we provide upper bounds on the convergence rate of
the approximate NPMLE's statistical error, which have the same order as the
best known bounds for the true NPMLE. This suggests that the approximate NPMLE
is just as effective as the true NPMLE for statistical applications. Second, we
illustrate the promise of NPMLE procedures in a high-dimensional binary

terms of the mean bias and stochasticity as a function of local overdensity
($\delta$), under different filtering scales, which is realized as the density
of individual cells in uniform grids. The sampled overdensities span a range
wide enough to provide the fully nonlinear bias effect on the formation of

peak-background split method based on the excursion set formalism, as long as
the empirical, globally-averaged halo mass function is used. Consequently, this
bias formalism is insensitive to uncertainties caused by varying halo
identification schemes, and can be applied generically. We also find that the
probability distribution function of biased halo numbers has wider distribution

halo correlation. We explicitly calculate this correlation function and show

we derive in a self-consistent approach density- dependent meson-baryon
vertices. At the mean-field level, we include isoscalar and isovector scalar
and vector interactions. The nuclear equation of state is investigated for a
large range of total baryon densities up to the neutron star regime, the full
range of asymmetries from symmetric nuclear matter to pure neutron matter, and
temperatures up to T~100 MeV. The isovector-scalar self-energies are found to
modify strongly the thermal properties of asymmetric nuclear matter. A striking
result is the change of phase transitions when isovector-scalar self-energies

Zeeman splitting and magnetic tuning of polarization and coherence of the
excitonic valley pseudospin, by performing polarization-resolved
magneto-photoluminescence on monolayer WSe2. Our measurements reveal both the
atomic orbital and lattice contributions to the valley orbital magnetic moment;
demonstrate the deviation of the band edges in the valleys from an exact

magnetic responses of neutral and charged valley excitons which is explained by
renormalization of the excitonic spectrum due to strong exchange interactions.

nonaxisymmetric magnetorotational instability, which amplifies the magnetic
field in the HMNS. These two amplification mechanisms cannot be found with

examples outputs a generalizing hypothesis while preserving the privacy of each

construction of private learners, in which the sample complexity is (generally)
higher than what is needed for non-private learners. This gap in the sample
complexity was then further studied in several followup papers, showing that
(at least in some cases) this gap is unavoidable. Moreover, those papers
considered ways to overcome the gap, by relaxing either the privacy or the
learning guarantees of the learner.
  We suggest an alternative approach, inspired by the (non-private) models of
semi-supervised learning and active-learning, where the focus is on the sample
complexity of labeled examples whereas unlabeled examples are of a
significantly lower cost. We consider private semi-supervised learners that
operate on a random sample, where only a (hopefully small) portion of this
sample is labeled. The learners have no control over which of the sample
elements are labeled. Our main result is that the labeled sample complexity of
private learners is characterized by the VC dimension.
  We present two generic constructions of private semi-supervised learners. The
first construction is of learners where the labeled sample complexity is
proportional to the VC dimension of the concept class, however, the unlabeled
sample complexity of the algorithm is as big as the representation length of
domain elements. Our second construction presents a new technique for
decreasing the labeled sample complexity of a given private learner, while
roughly maintaining its unlabeled sample complexity. In addition, we show that
in some settings the labeled sample complexity does not depend on the privacy
parameters of the learner.

observations, it is very important to investigate the effects of small-scale
structures and dynamics on the HMI observables, such as Doppler shift,
continuum intensity, spectral line depth, and width. We use 3D radiative
hydrodynamics simulations of the upper turbulent convective layer and the
atmosphere of the Sun, and a spectro-polarimetric radiative transfer code to
study observational characteristics of the Fe I 6173A line observed by HMI in
quiet-Sun regions. We use the modeling results to investigate the sensitivity
of the line Doppler shift to plasma velocity, and also sensitivities of the
line parameters to plasma temperature and density, and determine effective line
formation heights for observations of solar regions located at different
distances from the disc center. These estimates are important for the
interpretation of helioseismology measurements. In addition, we consider
various center-to-limb effects, such as convective blue-shift, variations of
helioseismic travel-times, and the 'concave' Sun effect, and show that the
simulations can qualitatively reproduce the observed phenomena, indicating that
these effects are related to a complex interaction of the solar dynamics and
radiative transfer.

complete theoretical picture, some of these equivalent conditions are readily
checkable from quiver and relations. In case of existence of a moduli space --
unexpectedly frequent in light of the stringency of fine classification -- this

electron, proton, and neutron spins. Traditionally, constraints from atomic
experiments on exotic couplings to neutron and proton spins have been derived
using the single-particle Schmidt model for nuclear spin. In this model,
particular atomic species are sensitive to either neutron or proton spin
couplings, but not both. More recently, semi-empirical models employing nuclear
magnetic moment data have been used to derive new constraints for non-valence
nucleons. However, comparison of such semi-empirical models to detailed
large-scale nuclear shell model calculations and analysis of known physical

generic module for any irreducible component $\mathcal C$, that is, of a module
which displays all categorically defined generic properties of the modules

programming (SDP) problems and then solve them by SDP solvers. In this paper,
we focus on reducing the sizes of inputs to SDP solvers to improve the
efficiency and reliability of those SDP based methods. Two types of
polynomials, convex cover polynomials and split polynomials, are defined. A
convex cover polynomial or a split polynomial can be decomposed into several
smaller sub-polynomials such that the original polynomial is SOS if and only if
the sub-polynomials are all SOS. Thus the original SOS problem can be
decomposed equivalently into smaller sub-problems. It is proved that convex
cover polynomials are split polynomials and it is quite possible that sparse
polynomials with many variables are split polynomials, which can be efficiently
detected in practice. Some necessary conditions for polynomials to be SOS are
also given, which can help refute quickly those polynomials which have no SOS
representations so that SDP solvers are not called in this case. All the new
results lead to a new SDP based method to compute SOS decompositions, which
improves this kind of methods by passing smaller inputs to SDP solvers in some
cases. Experiments show that the number of monomials obtained by our program is
often smaller than that by other SDP based software, especially for polynomials

robotic positioner to allow simultaneous positioning of optical fibers at the
focal plane called 'Starbugs'. The Starbug devices each consist of two
concentric piezoelectric tubes that 'walk' the optical fiber over the focal
plane to accuracy of several microns. Ongoing research has led to the
development of several Starbug prototypes, but lack of performance data has
hampered further progress in the design of the Starbug positioners and the
support equipment required to power and control them. Furthermore, Starbugs
have been selected for the TAIPAN instrument, a prototype for MANIFEST on the
GMT. A need now arises to measure and characterize 100's of piezoelectric tubes
before full scale production of Starbugs for TAIPAN. The manual measurements of
these piezoelectric tubes are a time consuming process taking several hours.
Therefore, a versatile automated system is needed to measure and characterize
these tubes in the laboratory before production of Starbugs. We have solved
this problem with the design of an automated LabVIEW application that
significantly reduces test times to several minutes. We present the various
design aspects of the automation system and provide analyses of example
piezoelectric tubes for Starbugs.

proposed for tracking community structure of dynamic networks. Community
structure is intuitively characterized as divisions of network nodes into
subgroups, within which nodes are densely connected while between which they
are sparsely connected. To evaluate the quality of community structure of a
network, a metric called modularity is proposed and many algorithms are
developed on optimizing it. However, most of the modularity based algorithms
deal with static networks and cannot be performed frequently, due to their high
computing complexity. In order to track the community structure of dynamic
networks in a fine-grained way, we propose a modularity based algorithm that is
incremental and has very low computing complexity. In our algorithm we adopt a
two-step approach. Firstly we apply the algorithm of Blondel et al for
detecting static communities to obtain an initial community structure. Then,
apply our incremental updating strategies to track the dynamic communities. The
performance of our algorithm is measured in terms of the modularity. We test
the algorithm on tracking community structure of Enron Email and three other
real world datasets. The experimental results show that our algorithm can keep
track of community structure in time and outperform the well known CNM
algorithm in terms of modularity.

at each stage of the nucleation process, including the quasi-static initial
phase, the unstable acceleration phase and the high-speed rupture phase or a
mainshock. Two kinds of nucleation lengths L_sc and L_c are identified and
investigated. The nucleation length L_sc and the initial phase exist only for a
weak frictional instability regime, while the nucleation length L_c and the
acceleration phase exist for both weak and strong instability regimes. Both
L_sc and L_c are found to be determined by the model parameters, the frictional
weakening parameter and the elastic stiffness parameter, hardly dependent on
the size of an ensuing mainshock. The sliding velocity is extremely slow in the
initial phase up to L_sc, of order the pulling speed of the plate, while it
reaches a detectable level at a certain stage of the acceleration phase. The
continuum limits of the results are discussed. The continuum limit of the BK
model lies in the weak frictional instability regime so that a mature
homogeneous fault under the RSF law always accompanies the quasi-static
nucleation process. Duration times of each stage of the nucleation process are
examined. The relation to the elastic continuum model and implications to real

clearly identified in the 12CO and C18O emission, and its outer radius (~700
AU) and mass (~0.005 Msun) are comparable to those of disks around T Tauri
stars. The protostellar mass is estimated to be 1.6 Msun with the inclination
angle of 66 deg. In addition to the Keplerian disk, there are blueshifted and
redshifted off-axis protrusions seen in the C18O emission pointing toward the
north and the south, respectively, adjunct to the middle part of the Keplerian
disk. The shape and kinematics of these protrusions can be interpreted as
streams of infalling flows with a conserved angular momentum following
parabolic trajectories toward the Keplerian disk, and the mass infalling rate
is estimated to be ~5E-7 Msun/yr. The specific angular momentum of the
infalling flows (~2.5E-3 km/s*pc) is comparable to that at the outer radius of
the Keplerian disk (~4.8E-3 km/s*pc). The SO emission is elongated along the
disk major axis and exhibits a linear velocity gradient along the axis, which
is interpreted as that the SO emission primarily traces a ring region in the
flared Keplerian disk at radii of ~250-390 AU. The local enhancement of the SO
abundance in the ring region can be due to the accretion shocks at the
centrifugal radius where the infalling flows fall onto the disk. Our ALMA
observations unveiled both the Keplerian disk and the infalling gas onto the
disk, and the disk can further grow by accreting material and angular momenta
from the infalling gas.

spherical Couette flow enclosed between two concentric spherical shells where
the inner sphere holds a strong dipolar magnet, which acts as a magnetic
propeller when rotated. Measurements of the mean velocity, mean induced
magnetic field and mean electric potentials have been acquired inside and
outside the fluid for an inner sphere rotation rate of 9 Hz (Rm 28). Using the
induction equation to relate all measured quantities to the mean flow, we
develop a nonlinear least square inversion procedure to reconstruct a fully
coherent solution of the mean velocity field. We also include in our inversion
the response of the fluid layer to the non-axisymmetric time-dependent magnetic
field that results from deviations of the imposed magnetic field from an axial
dipole. The mean azimuthal velocity field we obtain shows super-rotation in an
inner region close to the inner sphere where the Lorentz force dominates, which
contrasts with an outer geostrophic region governed by the Coriolis force, but
where the magnetic torque remains the driver. The meridional circulation is
strongly hindered by the presence of both the Lorentz and the Coriolis forces.
Nevertheless, it contributes to a significant part of the induced magnetic
energy. Our approach sets the scene for evaluating the contribution of velocity
and magnetic fluctuations to the mean magnetic field, a key question for dynamo
mechanisms.

capacity, planning can be separated into demand planning or capacity planning.
Scheduling period is the time horizon where price and average production cost

  $$\sum_{k} c_k^2\frac{(\log\log k)^4}{(\log\log \log k)^2} <\infty,$$ then
the series $ \sum_{k } c_kf_k$ converges almost everywhere.
  This slightly improves a recent result, depending on a fine analysis on the
polydisc (\cite{ABS}, th.3) ($n_k=k$), where it was assumed that $ \sum_{k}
c_k^2 \, (\log\log k)^\g $ converges for some $\g>4$. We further show that the
same conclusion holds under the arithmetical condition $$\sum_{ k }
  c_k^2 (\log\log k)^{2 + b} \s_{ -1+\frac{1}{(\log\log k)^{ b/3}} }(k)
<\infty,$$ for some $b>0$, or if $ \sum_{ k} c_k^2 d(k^2) (\log\log k)^2
<\infty$. We also derive from a recent result of Hilberdink an $\O$-result for
the Riemann Zeta function involving factor closed sets.
  We finally prove an important complementary result to Wintner's famous
characterization of mean convergence of series $\sum_{k=0}^\infty c_k f_k $.

their parameterizations. In this contribution we will focus on surfaces of
revolution. These objects, widely used in geometric modelling, are generated by
rotating a generatrix around a given axis. If the generatrix is an algebraic
curve then so is also the resulting surface, described uniquely by a polynomial
which can be found by some well-established implicitation technique. However,
starting from a polynomial it is not known how to decide if the corresponding
algebraic surface is rotational or not. Motivated by this, our goal is to
formulate a simple and efficient algorithm whose input is a polynomial with the
coefficients from some subfield of $\mathbb{R}$ and the output is the answer
whether the shape is a surface of revolution. In the affirmative case we also
find the equations of its axis and generatrix. Furthermore, we investigate the
problem of rationality and unirationality of surfaces of revolution and show
that this question can be efficiently answered discussing the rationality of a
certain associated planar curve.

it among $m$ machines and learn the parameter of interest by averaging the $m$

or equivalently M-estimation, we study the statistical error incurred by this
strategy. We consider two large-sample settings: First, a classical setting
where the number of parameters $p$ is fixed, and the number of samples per
machine $n\to\infty$. Second, a high-dimensional regime where both
$p,n\to\infty$ with $p/n \to \kappa \in (0,1)$. For both regimes and under
suitable assumptions, we present asymptotically exact expressions for this
estimation error. In the fixed-$p$ setting, under suitable assumptions, we
prove that to leading order averaging is as accurate as the centralized
solution. We also derive the second order error terms, and show that these can
be non-negligible, notably for non-linear models. The high-dimensional setting,
in contrast, exhibits a qualitatively different behavior: data splitting incurs
a first-order accuracy loss, which to leading order increases linearly with the
number of machines. The dependence of our error approximations on the number of
machines traces an interesting accuracy-complexity tradeoff, allowing the
practitioner an informed choice on the number of machines to deploy. Finally,
we confirm our theoretical analysis with several simulations.

stars within them and accrete large amounts of gas from their surroundings.
Hence, it should be possible to find young massive clusters in the local
Universe that contain significant amounts ($>10$\%) of the cluster mass of gas
and/or dust within them. Recent theoretical studies have suggested that
clusters in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) with masses in excess of
$10^4$\msun\, and ages between $30$ and $\sim300$~Myr, should contain such gas
reservoirs. We have searched for \hi\ gas within 12 LMC (and 1 SMC) clusters
and also for dust using {\em Spitzer} 70\micron\ and 160\micron\ images. No
clusters were found to contain gas and/or dust. While two of the clusters have
\hi\ at the same (projected) position and velocity, the gas does not appear to
be centred on the clusters, but rather part of nearby clouds or filaments,
suggesting that the gas and cluster are not directly related. This lack of gas
($<1$\% of the stellar mass) is in strong tension with model predictions, and
may be due to higher stellar feedback than has been previously assumed or due
to the assumptions used in the previous calculations.

with probabilistic evolution over a continuous domain and control-dependent
discrete dynamics over a finite set of modes. In the past few years several
different techniques have been developed to assist in the stability analysis of
stochastic switched systems. However, more complex and challenging objectives
related to the verification of and the controller synthesis for logic
specifications have not been formally investigated for this class of systems as
of yet. With logic specifications we mean properties expressed as formulae in
linear temporal logic or as automata on infinite strings. This paper addresses
these complex objectives by constructively deriving approximately equivalent
(bisimilar) symbolic models of stochastic switched systems. More precisely,
this paper provides two different symbolic abstraction techniques: one requires
state space discretization, but the other one does not require any space
discretization which can be potentially more efficient than the first one when
dealing with higher dimensional stochastic switched systems. Both techniques
provide finite symbolic models that are approximately bisimilar to stochastic
switched systems under some stability assumptions on the concrete model. This
allows formally synthesizing controllers (switching signals) that are valid for
the concrete system over the finite symbolic model, by means of mature
automata-theoretic techniques in the literature. The effectiveness of the
results are illustrated by synthesizing switching signals enforcing logic
specifications for two case studies including temperature control of a six-room
building.

activity in plasma has been observed on many tokamaks and more recently has
been a focus of research on MAST (Turnyanskiy M. et al, 2011 Nucl. Fusion 53

neutron emission rate corresponding to a significant perturbation of the
fast-ion population in the plasma. Theoretical work on fishbone modes states
that the fast-ion distribution itself acts as the source of free energy driving
the modes that cause the redistribution. Therefore a series of experiments have
been carried out on MAST to investigate a range of plasma density levels at two
neutral beam power levels to determine the region within this parameter space
in which MHD activity and consequent fast-ion redistribution is suppressed.
Analysis of these experiments shows complete suppression of MHD activity at
high density with increasing activity and fast-ion redistribution at lower
densities and higher NB power accompanied by strong evidence for localisation
of the redistribution effect to a specific region in the plasma core. The
results also indicate correlations between the form of the modelled fast-ion
distribution function, the amplitude and growth rate of the fishbone modes, and
the magnitude of the redistribution effect. The same analysis has been carried
out on models of MAST-Upgrade baseline plasma scenarios to determine whether
significant fast-ion redistribution is likely to occur in that device. A simple
change to the neutral-beam injector geometry is proposed which is shown to have
a significant mitigating effect in terms of the fishbone mode drive and is
therefore expected to allow effective plasma heating and current drive over a
wider range of plasma conditions in MAST-Upgrade.

(MH) experiments is of crucial importance for a fine optimization of
nanoparticle (NP) heating power. In this study, we use a kinetic Monte-Carlo
algorithm to calculate hysteresis loops, so both time and temperature are
correctly taken into account. It is demonstrated that this algorithm correctly
reproduces the high-frequency hysteresis loop of both superparamagnetic NPs and
ferromagnetic ones without any ad-hoc parameters. The algorithm is easily
parallelizable so calculation on several processors decreases considerably
calculation time. The specific absorption rate (SAR) of NPs dispersed inside
spherical lysosomes is studied as a function of several key parameters: volume
concentration, applied magnetic field, lysosome size, NP diameter and
anisotropy. The influence of these parameters is illustrated and
comprehensively explained. In summary, the effect of magnetic interactions is
to increase the coercive field, saturation field and hysteresis area of major
loops. However, for small amplitude magnetic field such as the ones used in MH,
the heating power as function of concentration can increase, decrease or
display a bell shape, depending of the relationship between the applied
magnetic field and the coercive/saturation fields of the NPs. The hysteresis
area is found to be well correlated to the parallel or antiparallel nature of
the dipolar field acting on each NP. It is shown that the heating power
increases or decreases sharply in the vicinity of the lysosome membrane. The
amplitude of variation reaches more than one order of magnitude in certain
conditions. Finally, implications of these various findings are discussed in
the framework of MH optimization. It is concluded that feedbacks on specific
points from biology experiments are required for further advance on the
optimization of NPs for MH.

on a 4-bus and a 39-bus systems. Numerical results show that with limited
flexibility on the demand-side substantial benefits in terms of potential

distributions of blocks that are not easily explained. In this paper, we
investigate the possibility that seismic shaking leads to the size sorting of
particles in asteroids. In particular, we focus on the so-called Brazil Nut
Effect (BNE) that separates large particles from small ones under vibrations.
We study the BNE over a wide range of parameters by using the N-body code
PKDGRAV, and find that the effect is largely insensitive to the coefficients of
restitution, but sensitive to friction constants and oscillation speeds.
Agreeing with the previous results, we find that convection drives the BNE,
where the intruder rises to the top of the particle bed. For the wide-cylinder
case, we also observe a ""whale"" effect, where the intruder follows the
convective current and does not stay at the surface. We show that the
non-dimensional critical conditions for the BNE agree well with previous
studies. We also show that the BNE is scalable for low-gravity environments and
that the rise speed of an intruder is proportional to the square root of the
gravitational acceleration. Finally, we apply the critical conditions to
observed asteroids, and find that the critical oscillation speeds are
comparable to the seismic oscillation speeds that are expected from
non-destructive impacts.

coupled model of gravity on a Solar System short range regime. For this reason,
this study is only valid when the cosmological contribution is considered
irrelevant. The action functional of the model involves two functions $f^1(R)$
and $f^2(R)$ of the Ricci scalar curvature $R$, where the last one multiplies
the matter Lagrangian.
  Using a Taylor expansion around $R=0$ for both functions $f^1(R)$ and
$f^2(R)$, it was found that the metric around a spherical object is a
perturbation of the weak-field Schwarzschild metric. The $tt$ component of the
metric, a Newtonian plus a Yukawa perturbation term, is constrained using the
available observational results.
  First it is shown that this effect is null when the characteristic mass
scales of each function $f^1(R)$ and $f^2(R)$ are identical. Besides, the
conclusion is that the nonminimal coupling only affects the Yukawa contribution
strength and not its range and that the Starobinsky model for inflation is not
experimentally constrained. Moreover, the geodetic precession effect, obtained
also from the radial perturbation of the metric, reveals to be of no relevance
for the constraints.

Exploration of Radio Astrometry, in the current third burst since 2011 March.
Three flux maxima are detected in 2011 and 2012 with rising and falling
timescales of 2-7 months. Time variations of the supermaser seem symmetric for
all of the active phases. The maximum total flux density of 135000 Jy is
observed in 2012 June while it is still one order of magnitude lower than those
in previous bursts. The supermaser consists of two spatially different
components at different velocities. They are elongated along a
northwest-southeast direction perpendicular to the low-velocity outflow driven
by Source I. Proper motions of the supermaser features with respect to Source I
are measured toward west and southwest directions, almost parallel to the
low-velocity outflow. The flux density and linewidth show an anti-correlation
as expected for an unsaturated maser emission. The supermaser is located close
to the methylformate (HCOOCH3) line and continuum emission peaks in the Orion
Compact Ridge detected by ALMA. The broader velocity range of the weak HCOOCH3
emission at the supermaser position would be an evidence of a shock front. On
the other hand, the 321 GHz H2O line is not detected at the position of the
supermaser. It can be explained qualitatively by one of the theoretical H2O
excitation models without extraordinary conditions. Our results support a
scenario that the supermaser is excited in the dense gas interacting with the
low-velocity outflow in the Compact Ridge. The extremely high flux density and
its symmetric time variation for rising and falling phases could be explained
by a beaming effect during the amplification process rather than changes in
physical conditions.

This paper considers the uplink interference in a 5G heterogeneous network
which is jointly covered by one macro cell and several small cells. Based on
the L\'{e}vy flight moving model, a mobility-aware interference model is
proposed to characterize the uplink interference from macro cell users to small

its moment generating function, for both closed subscriber group (CSG) and open
subscriber group (CSG) femto cells. In addition, the proposed interference
model is a function of basic step length, which is a key velocity parameter of
L\'{e}vy flights. It is shown by both theoretical analysis and simulation
results that the proposed interference model provides a flexible way of
evaluating the system performance in terms of success probability and average

sampling oscilloscope. The charge carriers in the sensor were produced by
picosecond lasers with light of wavelengths of 675 and 1060 nm. The transfer
function is determined from the 1060 nm data with the pad diode biased at 1000
V. It is shown that the simulated sensor response convoluted with this transfer
function provides an excellent description of the measured transients for the
laser light of both wavelengths, at voltages 50 V above the depletion voltage
of about 90 V up to the maximum applied voltage of 1000 V. The method has been
developed for the precise measurement of the dependence of the drift velocity
of electrons and holes in high-ohmic silicon on crystal orientation, electric
field and temperature. It can also be applied for the analysis of
transient-current measurements of radiation-damaged solid state sensors, as
long as sensors properties, like high-frequency capacitance, are not too
different.

studied. The plasma is, in general, non-equilibrium but homogeneous. We
consider anisotropic momentum distributions of plasma constituents which are
obtained from the isotropic one by stretching or squeezing in one direction.
This leads to prolate or oblate distributions, respectively. We study all
possible degrees of one dimensional deformation from the extremely prolate
case, when the momentum distribution is infinitely elongated in one direction,
to the extremely oblate distribution, which is infinitely squeezed in the same
direction. In between these extremes we discuss arbitrarily prolate, weakly
prolate, isotropic, weakly oblate and arbitrarily oblate distributions. For
each case, the number of modes is determined using a Nyquist analysis and the
complete spectrum of plasmons is found analytically if possible, and
numerically when not. Unstable modes are shown to exist in all cases except
that of isotropic plasma. We derive conditions on the wave vectors for the
existence of these instabilities. We also discuss stable modes which are not
limited to small domains of wave vectors and therefore have an important
influence on the system's dynamics.

strokes with the rapidly remodelling actin network results in a regulation of
force and cell shape that adapts to the stiffness of the environment.
Instantaneous changes of the environment stiffness are found to trigger an
intrinsic mechanical response of the actomyosin cortex. Cortical retrograde
flow resulting from actin polymerisation at the edges is shown to be modulated
by the stress resulting from myosin contractility, which in turn regulates the
cell size in a force-dependent manner. The model describes the maximum force
that cells can exert and the maximum speed at which they can contract, which
are measured experimentally. These limiting cases are found to be associated
with energy dissipation phenomena which are of the same nature as those taking

shown that if either of the metrics is an Einstein solution then the other is
always forced to be Einstein, too. For a class of bimetric models this
constraint is stronger and as soon as one metric is Einstein, the other metric
is forced to be proportional to it. As a consequence, the models in this class
avoid a branch of pathological solutions that exhibit determinant singularities
or nonlinear ghosts. These constraints persists in a generalized form when
sources are included, but are destroyed in the massive gravity limit of the
theory. (2) For another class of bimetric models, we show the existence of
solutions that do not admit a massive gravity limit. A bimetric model that
could exhibit a nonlinear version of ""partially massless"" symmetry belongs to
both these classes. It is argued that if such a model exits, its symmetry will
not survive in the massive gravity limit.

linear in the number of edges used. The time complexity is significantly better

succeeds at a significantly lower density than the spectral approaches,

critical use of power iteration with subsampling, which might be of independent

Many such stochastic processes, especially those that are associated with
complex systems, become more constrained as they unfold, meaning that their
sample-space, or their set of possible outcomes, reduces as they age. We
demonstrate that these sample-space reducing (SSR) processes necessarily lead
to Zipf's law in the rank distributions of their outcomes. We show that by
adding noise to SSR processes the corresponding rank distributions remain exact
power-laws, $p(x)\sim x^{-\lambda}$, where the exponent directly corresponds to
the mixing ratio of the SSR process and noise. This allows us to give a precise
meaning to the scaling exponent in terms of the degree to how much a given
process reduces its sample-space as it unfolds. Noisy SSR processes further
allow us to explain a wide range of scaling exponents in frequency
distributions ranging from $\alpha = 2$ to $\infty$. We discuss several
applications showing how SSR processes can be used to understand Zipf's law in
word frequencies, and how they are related to diffusion processes in directed
networks, or ageing processes such as in fragmentation processes. SSR processes
provide a new alternative to understand the origin of scaling in complex
systems without the recourse to multiplicative, preferential, or self-organised
critical processes.

causes a strong onset of color transparency effects manifested themselves as a
steep rise of the nuclear modification factor $R_{AA}(p_T)$ at large hadron
$p_T$'s. A dominance of quarks with higher $l_p$ leads to a weaker suppression
at RHIC than the one observed at LHC. In the RHIC kinematic region we include
an additional suppression factor steeply falling with $p_T$, which is tightly
related to the energy conservation constraints. The latter is irrelevant at LHC
up to $p_T\lesssim 70$ GeV while it causes a rather flat $p_T$ dependence of
the $R_{AA}(p_T)$ factor at RHIC c.m. energy $\sqrt{s} = 200$ GeV and even an

fluid in a perforated domain. The porous medium is composed of inclusions of
size $\varepsilon$ separated by distances $d_\varepsilon$ and the fluid fills
the exterior.
  If the inclusions are distributed on the unit square, the asymptotic behavior
depends on the limit of $\frac{d_{\varepsilon}}\varepsilon$ when $\varepsilon$
goes to zero. If $\frac{d_{\varepsilon}}\varepsilon\to \infty$, then the limit
motion is not perturbed by the porous medium, namely we recover the Euler
solution in the whole space. On the contrary, if
$\frac{d_{\varepsilon}}\varepsilon\to 0$, then the fluid cannot penetrate the
porous region, namely the limit velocity verifies the Euler equations in the
exterior of an impermeable square.
  If the inclusions are distributed on the unit segment then the behavior
depends on the geometry of the inclusion: it is determined by the limit of
$\frac{d_{\varepsilon}}{\varepsilon^{2+\frac1\gamma}}$ where $\gamma\in
(0,\infty]$ is related to the geometry of the lateral boundaries of the
obstacles. If $\frac{d_{\varepsilon}}{\varepsilon^{2+\frac1\gamma}} \to
\infty$, then the presence of holes is not felt at the limit, whereas an
impermeable wall appears if this limit is zero. Therefore, for a distribution
in one direction, the critical distance depends on the shape of the inclusions.
In particular it is equal to $\varepsilon^3$ for balls.

from the decay of the one particle mode into two-particle states. This decay
arises from (i) a finite overlap between the one-particle dispersion and the
two-particle continuum in a narrow energy-momentum range and (ii) a small
misalignment of the applied field away from the direction perpendicular to the
Ising axis in the experiments, which allows for non-zero matrix elements for
decay by breaking the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ spin inversion symmetry of the
Hamiltonian.

Most of the existing works consider a batch setting, and use cross-validation
to tune parameters. The classical method consists in minimizing the root mean
square error over a training subset of the ratings which provides a
factorization of the matrix of ratings, interpreted as a latent representation
of items and users. Our contribution in this paper is 5-fold. First, we
explicit the issues raised by this kind of batch setting for users or items
with very few ratings. Then, we propose an online setting closer to the actual
use of recommender systems; this setting is inspired by the bandit framework.
The proposed methodology can be used to turn any recommender system dataset
(such as Netflix, MovieLens,...) into a sequential dataset. Then, we explicit a
strong and insightful link between contextual bandit algorithms and matrix
factorization; this leads us to a new algorithm that tackles the
exploration/exploitation dilemma associated to the cold start problem in a
strikingly new perspective. Finally, experimental evidence confirm that our
algorithm is effective in dealing with the cold start problem on publicly

time-dependence of the coefficient of the gauge kinetic term

of the model can consistently generate the cosmological magnetic fields
required by observations. We propose a generalization of this model, where also
the pseudoscalar invariant $F_{\mu\nu}\,\tilde{F}^{\mu\nu}$ is multiplied by a
time dependent function. The new parity violating term allows more freedom in
tuning the amplitude of the field at the end of inflation. Moreover, it leads
to a helical magnetic field that is amplified at large scales by
magnetohydrodynamical processes during the radiation dominated epoch. As a
consequence, our model can satisfy the observational lower bounds on fields in
the intergalactic medium, while providing a seed for the galactic dynamo, if
inflation occurs at an energy scale ranging from $10^5$ to $10^{10}$ GeV. Such
energy scale is well below that suggested by the recent BICEP2 result, if the
latter is due to primordial tensor modes. However, the gauge field is a source
of tensors during inflation and generates a spectrum of gravitational waves
that can give a sizable tensor to scalar ratio $r={\cal O}(0.2)$ even if
inflation occurs at low energies. This system therefore evades the Lyth bound.
For smaller values of $r$, lower values of the inflationary energy scale are
required. The model predicts fully helical cosmological magnetic fields and a
chiral spectrum of primordial gravitational waves.

parameters, these radiative corrections may also lead to the situation that the
local minimum corresponding to the electroweak vacuum state is not the global
minimum of the Higgs potential. We analyze the stability of the vacuum for the
case of heavy squark masses as favored by current LHC data. To this end we
first consider an effective Lagrangian obtained by integrating out the heavy
squarks and then study the MSSM one-loop effective potential V_eff, which
comprises all higher-dimensional Higgs couplings of the effective Lagrangian.
We find that only the second method gives correct results and argue that the
criterion of vacuum stability should be included in phenomenological analyses

radiation field gives rise to holonomy at null infinity. (This was noted
earlier, by Bramson.) This means that, when gravitational radiation is present,
asymptotically covariantly constant vector fields do not exist. On the other
hand, according to the Bondi-Sachs construction, a weaker class of
asymptotically constant vectors does exist. Reconciling these concepts leads to
a measure of the scattering of matter by gravitational waves, that is, bulk
exchanges of energy-momentum between the waves and matter. Because these bulk
effects are potentially larger than the tidal ones which have usually been
studied, they may affect the waves' propagation more significantly, and the
question of matter's transparency to gravitational radiation should be
revisited. While in many cases there is reason to think the waves will be only
slightly affected, some situations are identified in which the energy-momentum
exchanges can be substantial enough that a closer investigation should be made.
In particular, the work here suggests that gravitational waves produced when
relativistic jets are formed might be substantially affected by passing through

The upper and lower bounds coincide in many cases, giving rise to optimal

approach proceeds by establishing, more generally, upper and lower bounds for
the rate of distribution of dense orbits of a lattice subgroup $\Gamma $ in a
connected Lie (or algebraic) group $G$, acting on suitable homogeneous spaces
$G/H$. The upper bound is derived using a quantitative duality principle for
homogeneous spaces, reducing it to a rate of convergence in the mean ergodic
theorem for a family of averaging operators supported on $H$ and acting on
$G/\Gamma$. In particular, the quality of the upper bound on the rate of
distribution we obtain is determined explicitly by the spectrum of $H$ in the

effective mass increases (decreases) in the weak (strong) coupling regime,
respectively. However, in two dimensions, the decrease in effective mass still
results in too large an effective mass to be relevant in realistic models of
normal metals. In three dimensions the decrease can be more relevant, but
exists only over a very limited range of coupling strengths.

honeycomb symmetry, which is a Hamiltonian system describing the evolution of a
scalar-valued quantity subject to nearest neighbour interactions. Using
multiple-scale analysis we reduce the governing lattice equations to a
nonlinear Schrodinger (NLS) equation coupled to a second equation for an
accompanying slow mode. Two cases in which the latter equation can be solved
and so the system decoupled are considered in more detail: firstly, in the case
of a symmetric potential, we derive the form of moving breathers. We find an
ellipticity criterion for the wavenumbers of the carrier wave, together with
asymptotic estimates for the breather energy. The minimum energy threshold
depends on the wavenumber of the breather. We find that this threshold is
locally maximised by stationary breathers. Secondly, for an asymmetric
potential we find stationary breathers, which, even with a quadratic
nonlinearity generate no second harmonic component in the breather. Plots of
all our findings show clear hexagonal symmetry as we would expect from our
lattice structure. Finally, we compare the properties of stationary breathers
in the square, triangular and honeycomb lattices.

the key feature of a PS agent, a specific type of memory which is explored via
random walks, was shown to be amenable to quantization. In particular,
classical random walks were substituted by Szegedy-type quantum walks, allowing
for a speed-up. In this work we propose how such classical and quantum agents
can be implemented in systems of trapped ions. We employ a generic construction
by which the classical agents are `upgraded' to their quantum counterparts by
nested coherent controlization, and we outline how this construction can be
realized in ion traps. Our results provide a flexible modular architecture for
the design of PS agents. Furthermore, we present numerical simulations of
simple PS agents which analyze the robustness of our proposal under certain

during the 2007 global dust storm and during the following year. A wide variety
of change timings are detected such as dust deposited and then cleaned over a
Martian year, areas modified only during successive global dust storms, and
perennial changes over decades. Both similarities and differences with previous
global dust storms are observed. While an optically thin layer of bright dust
is involved in most changes, this coating turns out to be sufficient to mask
underlying mineralogical near-IR spectral signatures. Overall, changes result
from apparently erratic events; however, a cyclic evolution emerges for some

single photons with high brightness, purity, and long temporal coherence.
Semiconductor quantum dots potentially satisfy these requirements; however, due
to imperfections in the surrounding material, the coherence generally degrades
with increasing excitation power yielding a broader emission spectrum. Here we
overcome this power broadening regime and demonstrate the longest coherence at
exciton saturation where the detection count rates are highest. We detect
single-photon count rates of 460,000 counts per second under pulsed laser
excitation while maintaining a single-photon purity of greater than 99%.
Importantly, the enhanced coherence is attained with quantum dots in ultraclean
wurtzite InP nanowires, where the surrounding charge traps are filled by
exciting above the wurtzite InP nanowire bandgap. By raising the excitation
intensity, the number of possible charge configurations in the quantum dot
environment is reduced, resulting in a narrower emission spectrum. Via Monte
Carlo simulations we explain the observed narrowing of the emission spectrum
with increasing power. Cooling down the sample to 300 mK, we further enhance
the single-photon coherence two-fold as compared to operation at 4.5 K,
resulting in a homogeneous coherence time, T2, of 1.2 ns.

deterministic alternative to the random walk. In this model, a group of
identical tokens are initially placed at nodes of the graph. Each node
maintains a cyclic ordering of the outgoing arcs, and during consecutive turns
the tokens are propagated along arcs chosen according to this ordering in
round-robin fashion. The behavior of the model is fully deterministic. Yanovski
et al.(2003) proved that a single rotor-router walk on any graph with m edges
and diameter $D$ stabilizes to a traversal of an Eulerian circuit on the set of
all 2m directed arcs on the edge set of the graph, and that such periodic
behaviour of the system is achieved after an initial transient phase of at most
2mD steps. The case of multiple parallel rotor-routers was studied
experimentally, leading Yanovski et al. to the conjecture that a system of $k
\textgreater{} 1$ parallel walks also stabilizes with a period of length at
most $2m$ steps. In this work we disprove this conjecture, showing that the
period of parallel rotor-router walks can in fact, be superpolynomial in the
size of graph. On the positive side, we provide a characterization of the
periodic behavior of parallel router walks, in terms of a structural property
of stable states called a subcycle decomposition. This property provides us the
tools to efficiently detect whether a given system configuration corresponds to
the transient or to the limit behavior of the system. Moreover, we provide
polynomial upper bounds of $O(m^4 D^2 + mD \log k)$ and $O(m^5 k^2)$ on the
number of steps it takes for the system to stabilize. Thus, we are able to
predict any future behavior of the system using an algorithm that takes
polynomial time and space. In addition, we show that there exists a separation
between the stabilization time of the single-walk and multiple-walk
rotor-router systems, and that for some graphs the latter can be asymptotically
larger even for the case of $k = 2$ walks.

response to epidemics has the potential to save lives and minimize health care
costs. In this paper, we develop and apply a computationally efficient
algorithm that enables us to calculate the complete probability distribution
for the final epidemic size in a stochastic Susceptible-Infected-Recovered
(SIR) model. Based on these results, we determine the optimal allocations of a
limited quantity of vaccine between two non-interacting populations. We compare
the stochastic solution to results obtained for the traditional, deterministic
SIR model. For intermediate quantities of vaccine, the deterministic model is a
poor estimate of the optimal strategy for the more realistic, stochastic case.

  Capacity","Proposition 4 and Corollary 5 are wrong. The proofs have obvious
  defects",,,,"cs.PF math.PR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Tandem queues with finite buffer capacity commonly exist in practical
applications. By viewing a tandem queue as an integrated system, an innovative
approach has been developed to analyze its performance through the insight from
reduction method. In our approach, the starvation at the bottleneck caused by
service time randomness is modeled and captured by interruptions. Fundamental
properties of tandem queues with finite buffer capacity are examined. We show
that in general system service rate of a dual tandem queue with finite buffer
capacity is equal or smaller than its bottleneck service rate, and virtual
interruptions, which are the extra idle period at the bottleneck caused by the
non-bottlenecks, depend on arrival rates. Hence, system service rate is a
function of arrival rate when the buffer capacity of a tandem queue is finite.
Approximation for the mean queue time of a dual tandem queue has been developed
through the concept of virtual interruptions.

Illustrations of the spatio-temporal development of such processes are not only

three-level modeling approach to illustrate physiological processes from the
class of polymerization at different time scales. We integrate physical and

The
first problem is the reconstruction of the angular-domain periodogram from
spatial-domain signals received at different time indices. The second one is
the reconstruction of the frequency-domain periodogram from time-domain signals
received at different wireless sensors. We split the entire angular or
frequency band into uniform bins. The bin size is set such that the received
spectra at two frequencies or angles, whose distance is equal to or larger than
the size of a bin, are uncorrelated. These problems in the two different
domains lead to a similar circulant structure in the so-called coset
correlation matrix. This circulant structure allows for a strong compression
and a simple least-squares reconstruction method. The latter is possible under
the full column rank condition of the system matrix, which can be achieved by
designing the spatial or temporal sampling patterns based on a circular sparse
ruler. We analyze the statistical performance of the compressively
reconstructed periodogram including bias and variance. We further consider the
case when the bins are so small that the received spectra at two frequencies or
angles, with a spacing between them larger than the size of the bin, can still
be correlated. In this case, the resulting coset correlation matrix is
generally not circulant and thus a special approach is required.

ground-based millimeter-wave polarimeter, tailored for observing the cosmic
microwave background (CMB), to Isi Station in Greenland. The instrument for
this study is based on lumped-element kinetic inductance detectors (LEKIDs) and
an F/2.4 catoptric, crossed-Dragone telescope with a 500 mm aperture. The
telescope is mounted inside the receiver and cooled to $<\,4$ K by a
closed-cycle $^4$He refrigerator to reduce background loading on the detectors.
Linearly polarized signals from the sky are modulated with a metal-mesh
half-wave plate that is rotated at the aperture stop of the telescope with a
hollow-shaft motor based on a superconducting magnetic bearing. The modular
detector array design includes at least 2300 LEKIDs, and it can be configured
for spectral bands centered on 150~GHz or greater. Our study considered
configurations for observing in spectral bands centered on 150, 210 and
267~GHz. The entire polarimeter is mounted on a commercial precision rotary air
bearing, which allows fast azimuth scan speeds with negligible vibration and
mechanical wear over time. A slip ring provides power to the instrument,
enabling circular scans (360 degrees of continuous rotation). This mount, when
combined with sky rotation and the latitude of the observation site, produces a
hypotrochoid scan pattern, which yields excellent cross-linking and enables
34\% of the sky to be observed using a range of constant elevation scans. This
scan pattern and sky coverage combined with the beam size (15~arcmin at
150~GHz) makes the instrument sensitive to $5 < \ell < 1000$ in the angular
power spectra.
