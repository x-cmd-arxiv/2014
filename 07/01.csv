investigate the nature of interactions between rod-like molecules, for instance
actin and DNA. In conditions close to molecular condensation, one would expect
an appearance of a local minimum in the interaction potential between the two
molecules. We investigate this situation, introducing an attractive component
into the interaction potential, using a model developed for describing such
experiments. We consider attraction that does not depend on molecular
structure, as well that which depends on a DNA-like helix structure. In
braiding experiments, an attractive term may lead to certain effects. A local
minimum may cause molecules to collapse from a loosely braided configuration
into a tight one, occurring at a critical value of the moment applied about the
axis of the braid. For a fixed number of braid pitches, this may lead to
coexistence between the two braiding states, tight and loose. Coexistence
implies certain proportions of the braid are in each state, their relative size
depending on the number of braid pitches. This manifests itself as linear
dependence in numerically calculated quantities as functions of the number of
braid pitches. Also, in the collapsed state, the braid radius stays roughly
constant. Furthermore, if the attractive interaction is helix dependent, the
left-right handed braid symmetry is broken. For a DNA like charge distribution,
using the Kornyshev-Leikin interaction model, our results suggest that
significant braid collapse and coexistence only occurs for left handed braids.
Regardless of the interaction model, the study highlights the possible
qualitative physics of braid collapse and coexistence; and the role helix
specific forces might play, if important. The model could be used to connect
other microscopic theories of interaction with braiding experiments.

There are, however, several Datalog fragments for which containment is known to

recently as a joint generalization of these query languages. In this paper, we
study a wide range of Datalog fragments with decidable query containment and
determine exact complexity results for this problem. We generalize MQs to
(Frontier-)Guarded Queries (GQs), and show that the containment problem is
3ExpTime-complete in either case, even if we allow arbitrary Datalog in the
sub-query. If we focus on graph query languages, i.e., fragments of linear
Datalog, then this complexity is reduced to 2ExpSpace. We also consider nested
queries, which gain further expressivity by using predicates that are defined
by inner queries. We show that nesting leads to an exponentially increasing
hierarchy for the complexity of query containment, both in the linear and in
the general case. Our results settle open problems for (nested) MQs, and they

outside the applicability of FDE, mostly because of the lack of a periodic FDE

approach. On one side, the development of a theoretical framework for periodic
subsystem DFT. On the other, the realization of the method into a parallel
computer code. We find that periodic FDE is capable of reproducing total
electron densities and (to a lesser extent) also interaction energies of
molecular systems weakly interacting with metallic surfaces. In the pilot
calculations considered, we find that FDE fails in those cases where there is
appreciable density overlap between the subsystems. Conversely, we find FDE to
be in semiquantitative agreement (but still within chemical accuracy) with
Kohn--Sham DFT when the inter-subsystem density overlap is low. We also
conclude that to make FDE a suitable method for describing molecular adsorption

sensing of stochastic processes is studied. First, R\'enyi's notion of
information dimension (ID) is generalized to analog stationary processes. This
provides a measure of complexity for such processes and is connected to the
number of measurements required for their accurate recovery. Then a minimum
entropy pursuit (MEP) optimization approach is proposed, and it is proven that
it can reliably recover any stationary process satisfying some mixing
constraints from sufficient number of randomized linear measurements, without
having any prior information about the distribution of the process. It is
proved that a Lagrangian-type approximation of the MEP optimization problem,
referred to as Lagrangian-MEP problem, is identical to a heuristic
implementable algorithm proposed by Baron et al. It is shown that for the right
choice of parameters the Lagrangian-MEP algorithm, in addition to having the
same asymptotic performance as MEP optimization, is also robust to the
measurement noise. For memoryless sources with a discrete-continuous mixture
distribution, the fundamental limits of the minimum number of required
measurements by a non-universal compressed sensing decoder is characterized by
Wu et al. For such sources, it is proved that there is no loss in universal

world optimization problems often demand locating multiple optima within a

named as the Collective Animal Behavior (CAB). Animal groups, such as schools
of fish, flocks of birds, swarms of locusts and herds of wildebeest, exhibit a
variety of behaviors including swarming about a food source, milling around a
central location or migrating over large distances in aligned groups. These
collective behaviors are often advantageous to groups, allowing them to
increase their harvesting efficiency to follow better migration routes, to
improve their aerodynamic and to avoid predation. In the proposed algorithm,
searcher agents are a group of animals which interact to each other based on
the biological laws of collective motion. Experimental results demonstrate that
the proposed algorithm is capable of finding global and local optima of
benchmark multimodal optimization problems with a higher efficiency in

exemplified by two results which, once casted in the light of this relation,
are almost self evident. The first is a genuine, 5-lines proof, for the
isoperimetric inequality for $k$-cycles in $\mathbb{R}^n$, with a constant
differing from the optimal constant by a factor of only $\sqrt{k}$, as opposed

the parabolic Hausdorff measure of the space time track of high co-dimensional,
singular, mean curvature flow starting from a cycle, in terms of the mass of

and two remote ribbons occurred on March 9, 2011 at 23:13UT over a positive
flux region surrounded by negative flux at the center of the bipolar AR. Our
analysis of the coronal magnetic structure with potential and NLFFF solutions
unveiled the existence of a single magnetic null point associated with a
fan-spine topology and is co-spatial with the hard X-ray source. The footpoints
of the fan separatrix surface agree with the inner edge of the quasi-elliptical
ribbon and the outer spine is linked to one of the remote ribbons. During the
evolution, the slow footpoint motions stressed the fieldlines along the
polarity inversion line and caused electric current layers in the corona around
the fan separatrix surface. These current layers trigger magnetic reconnection
as a consequence of dissipating currents, which are visible as cusped shape
structures at lower heights. The reconnection process reorganised the magnetic
field topology whose signatures are observed at the separatrices/QSL structure
both in the photosphere and corona during the pre-to-post flare evolution. In
agreement with previous numerical studies, our results suggest that the
line-tied footpoint motions perturb the fan-spine system and cause null point
reconnection, which eventually causes the flare emission at the footpoints of
the fieldlines.

$e^\pm$ discharge. We follow the system evolution for several revolution
periods, longer than required to reach a quasi-steady state. Our numerical
experiment puts to test previous ideas for the plasma flow and gaps in the

magnetospheres are similar to the previously obtained force-free solutions with
a current sheet and the Y-point near the light cylinder. The magnetosphere
continually ejects $e^\pm$ pairs and ions. Pair creation is sustained by a
strong electric field along the current sheet. We observe powerful curvature
and synchrotron emission from the current sheet, consistent with Fermi

nonlinear conductivity, and specific heat. We demonstrate that the order
appears through a sharp phase transition, and exists in a dome-shaped region of
the phase diagram, similar to charge stripes. A comparison to recent
theoretical work shows that the order is a state without broken translational

many graph-based representations and algorithms for handling structured data,
especially in the emerging field of graph signal processing. However, a
meaningful graph is not always readily available from the data, nor easy to
define depending on the application domain. In particular, it is often
desirable in graph signal processing applications that a graph is chosen such
that the data admit certain regularity or smoothness on the graph. In this
paper, we address the problem of learning graph Laplacians, which is equivalent
to learning graph topologies, such that the input data form graph signals with
smooth variations on the resulting topology. To this end, we adopt a factor
analysis model for the graph signals and impose a Gaussian probabilistic prior
on the latent variables that control these signals. We show that the Gaussian
prior leads to an efficient representation that favors the smoothness property
of the graph signals. We then propose an algorithm for learning graphs that
enforces such property and is based on minimizing the variations of the signals
on the learned graph. Experiments on both synthetic and real world data
demonstrate that the proposed graph learning framework can efficiently infer

highly ordered magnetic field is present throughout the Galaxy's central
molecular zone (CMZ). The field within dense clouds of the central molecular
zone is predominantly parallel to the Galactic plane, probably as a result of
the strong tidal shear in that region. A second magnetic field system is
present outside of clouds, manifested primarily by a population of vertical,
synchrotron-emitting filamentary features aligned with the field. Whether or
not the strong vertical field is uniform throughout the CMZ remains
undetermined, but is a key central issue for the overall energetics and the
impact of the field on the Galactic center arena. The interactions between the
two field systems are considered, as they are likely to drive some of the
activity within the CMZ. As a proxy for other gas-rich galaxies in the local
group and beyond, the Galactic center region reveals that magnetic fields are
likely to be an important diagnostic, if not also a collimator, of the flow of
winds and energetic particles out of the nucleus.

framed both in a statistical context as well as in an engineering context. In
the first, the problem is dealt with by distinguishing between the 'classical'
approach and the 'inverse' regression approach. Both of these models are static
models and are used to estimate exact measurements from measurements that are
affected by error. In the engineering context, the variables of interest are
considered to be taken at the time at which you observe it. The Bayesian time
series analysis method of Dynamic Linear Models (DLM) can be used to monitor
the evolution of the measures, thus introducing an dynamic approach to
statistical calibration. The research presented employs the use of Bayesian
methodology to perform statistical calibration. The DLM's framework is used to
capture the time-varying parameters that maybe changing or drifting over time.
Two separate DLM based models are presented in this paper. A simulation study
is conducted where the two models are compared to some well known 'static'
calibration approaches in the literature from both the frequentist and Bayesian
perspectives. The focus of the study is to understand how well the dynamic
statistical calibration methods performs under various signal-to-noise ratios,
r. The posterior distributions of the estimated calibration points as well as
the 95% coverage intervals are compared by statistical summaries. These dynamic
methods are applied to a microwave radiometry data set.

for insight into the angular momentum transport in these stars. One means of
gaining such information is that of asteroseismology. By a forward modeling
approach we analyze in a qualitative manner the impact of different
differential rotation profiles on the splittings of p-mode oscillation
frequencies. The optimum modes for inference on differential rotation are
identified along with the best value of the stellar inclination angle. We find
that in general it is not likely that asteroseismology can be used to make an
unambiguous distinction between a rotation profile such as, e.g., a conical
Sun-like profile and a cylindrical profile. In addition, it seems unlikely that
asteroseismology of Sun-like stars will result in inferences on the radial
profile of the differential rotation, such as can be done for, e.g., red
giants. At best one could possibly obtain the sign of the radial differential
rotation gradient. Measurements of the extent of the latitudinal differential
from frequency splitting are, however, more promising. One very interesting
aspect that could likely be tested from frequency splittings is whether the
differential rotation is solar-like or anti-solar-like in nature, in the sense
that a solar-like profile has an equator rotating faster than the poles.

Hamiltonian featuring topologically distinct phases of matter. It describes a
mechanism through which a quantum Hall effect can appear as an intrinsic
property of a band-structure, rather than being caused by an external magnetic
field. Although an implementation in a material was considered unlikely, it has
provided the conceptual basis for theoretical and experimental research
exploring topological insulators and superconductors. Here we report on the
experimental realisation of the Haldane model and the characterisation of its
topological band-structure, using ultracold fermionic atoms in a periodically
modulated optical honeycomb lattice. The model is based on breaking
time-reversal symmetry as well as inversion symmetry. The former is achieved
through the introduction of complex next-nearest-neighbour tunnelling terms,
which we induce through circular modulation of the lattice position. For the
latter, we create an energy offset between neighbouring sites. Breaking either
of these symmetries opens a gap in the band-structure, which is probed using
momentum-resolved interband transitions. We explore the resulting
Berry-curvatures of the lowest band by applying a constant force to the atoms
and find orthogonal drifts analogous to a Hall current. The competition between
both broken symmetries gives rise to a transition between topologically
distinct regimes. By identifying the vanishing gap at a single Dirac point, we
map out this transition line experimentally and quantitatively compare it to
calculations using Floquet theory without free parameters. We verify that our
approach, which allows for dynamically tuning topological properties, is
suitable even for interacting fermionic systems. Furthermore, we propose a
direct extension to realise spin-dependent topological Hamiltonians.

$\mathcal{N}=1$ type II/F-theory compactifications that arise from curvature
terms in the action of D-branes and orientifold planes. We first show that a
recently proposed correction to the K\""ahler coordinates, which was argued to
appear at order $\alpha^{\prime 2}g_s$ and be proportional to the intersection
volume of D7-branes and O7-planes, is an artifact of an inconvenient field
basis in the dual M-theory frame and can be removed by a field redefinition of
the 11D metric. We then analyze to what extent curvature terms in the DBI and
WZ action may still lead to corrections of a similar kind and identify two
general mechanisms that can potentially modify the volume dependence of the
K\""ahler potential in the presence of D-branes and O-planes. The first
mechanism is related to an induced Einstein-Hilbert term on warped brane
worldvolumes, which leads to a shift in the classical volume of the
compactification manifold. The resulting corrections are generic and can appear
at one-loop order on branes and O-planes of various dimensions and for
configurations with or without intersections. We discuss in detail the example
of intersecting D7-branes/O7-planes, where a correction can appear already at
order $\alpha^{\prime 2}g_s^2$ in the K\""ahler potential. Due to an extended
no-scale structure, however, it is then still subleading in the scalar
potential. We also discuss a second mechanism, which is due to an induced
D3-brane charge in the WZ action of D7-branes. Contrary to the first type of
corrections, it appears at open string tree-level and shifts the definition of
the K\""ahler coordinates in terms of the classical volume but leaves the volume
itself uncorrected. Our work has implications for moduli stabilization and
model building and suggests interesting generalizations to F-theory.

corresponding to stellar populations traced by H$\alpha$, far ultraviolet
(FUV), and near ultraviolet (NUV) emission, we find that the fraction of
stellar populations young enough to contribute in H$\alpha$ is 15%-35% in the
inner regions, compared to less than 5% in the outer regions. This provides a
sufficient explanation for the lack of H$\alpha$ emission at large radii. We
also model the blue to red supergiant ratio in our five annuli, examine the
effects that a metallicity gradient and variable SFH have on the predicted
ratios, and compare to the observed values. We find that the radial behavior of
our modeled blue to red supergiant ratios is highly sensitive to both spatial
variations in the SFH and metallicity. Incorporating the derived SFH into
modeled ratios, we find that we are able to reproduce the observed values at
large radii (low metallicity), but at small radii (high metallicity) the
modeled and observed ratios are discrepant.

delayed by 1-2 Gyr relative to the CDM model, independently of the details of
SF and feedback. Independent of the DM model, but proportionally to the SF
efficiency, gas outflows lower the central mass density through `dynamical
heating', such that all realizations have circular velocities $<$ 20kms at
500$~$pc, in agreement with local kinematic constraints. As a result of
dynamical heating, older stars are less centrally concentrated than younger
stars, similar to stellar population gradients observed in nearby dwarf
galaxies. Introducing an important diagnostic of SF and feedback models, we
translate our simulations into artificial color-magnitude diagrams and star
formation histories in order to directly compare to available observations. The
simulated galaxies formed most of their stars in many $\sim$10 Myr long bursts.
The CDM galaxy has a global SFH, HI abundance and Fe/H and alpha-elements

is a bounded function of temperature. We then study the internal energy shift

focusing on the Lieb-Liniger model in 1d and on the anyonic gas in 2d. In 1d
the internal energy shift is determined from the thermodynamic Bethe ansatz

vanishes in the two limits of zero and infinite coupling (respectively the
ideal Bose and the Tonks Girardeau gas) and it has a maximum at a finite,

lattice Dirac fermions. Repulsive interactions between nearest neighbors drive
a quantum phase transition from a Dirac semimetal to a charge-density-wave
state through a fermionic quantum critical point, where the coupling of Ising
order parameter to the Dirac fermions at low energy drastically affects the
quantum critical behavior. Encouraged by a recently discovery of absence of the
fermion sign problem in this model, we study the fermionic quantum critical
point using the continuous time quantum Monte Carlo method with worm sampling
technique. We estimate the transition point $V/t= 1.356(1)$ with the critical
exponents $\nu =0.80(3)$ and $\eta =0.302(7)$. Compatible results for the
transition point are also obtained with infinite projected entangled-pair

on the neutron electric dipole moment. In the early universe, the QCD axion has
not yet relaxed to its QCD-cancelling minimum and it is natural to wonder
whether this large CP violation could be responsible for baryogenesis. We show
that strong CP violation from the QCD axion can be responsible for the matter
antimatter asymmetry of the universe in the context of cold electroweak (EW)
baryogenesis if the EW phase transition is delayed below the GeV scale. This
can occur naturally if the Higgs couples to a O(100) GeV dilaton, as expected
in some models where the Higgs is a pseudo-Nambu Goldstone boson of a new
strongly interacting sector at the TeV scale. The only new relevant ingredients
beyond the Standard Model in our framework are the QCD axion and an EW scale
dilaton-like scalar field. The existence of such a second scalar resonance with
a mass and properties similar to the Higgs boson will soon be tested at the
LHC. In this context, the QCD axion would not only solve the strong CP problem,
but also the matter anti-matter asymmetry and dark matter.

stars in supernovae (SNe) influences early cosmic history. Specifically, we
investigate the impact by SNe on the host systems for Population~III (Pop~III)
star formation and explore its dependence on halo environment and Pop~III
progenitor mass. We then trace the evolution of the enriched gas until
conditions are met to trigger second-generation star formation. To this extent,
we quantify the recovery timescale, which measures the time delay between a
Pop~III SN explosion and the appearance of cold, dense gas, out of which
second-generation stars can form. We find that this timescale is highly
sensitive to the Pop~III progenitor mass, and less so to the halo environment.
For more massive progenitors, including those exploding in pair instability
SNe, second-generation star formation is delayed significantly, for up to a
Hubble time. The dependence of the recovery time on the mass of the SN
progenitor is mainly due to the ionizing impact of the progenitor star.
Photoionization heating increases the gas pressure and initiates a
hydrodynamical response that reduces the central gas density, an effect that is
stronger in more massive. The gas around lower mass Pop~III stars remains
denser and hence the SN remnants cool more rapidly, facilitating the subsequent
re-condensation of the gas and formation of a second generation of stars. In
most cases, the second-generation stars are already metal-enriched to ~2-5 X
10^{-4}\zsun, thus belonging to Population~II. The recovery timescale is a key
quantity governing the nature of the first galaxies, able to host low-mass,
long-lived stellar systems. These in turn are the target of future deep-field

the case where there are more than one of these possible final attractors, and
we ask whether we can control the outcome (i.e., the attractor that ultimately
captures the trajectory) using only small controlling perturbations.
Specifically, we consider the problem of controlling a noisy system whose
parameter slowly drifts through a saddle-node bifurcation taking place on a
fractal boundary between the basins of multiple attractors. We show that, when
the noise level is low, a small perturbation of size comparable to the noise
amplitude applied at a single point in time can ensure that the system will
evolve toward a target attracting state with high probability. For a range of
noise levels, we find that the minimum size of perturbation required for
control is much smaller within a time period that starts some time after the
bifurcation, providing a ""window of opportunity"" for driving the system toward
a desirable state. We refer to this procedure as tipping point control.

Instead, we propose that doped holes in the cuprates reside in O $p\pi$

properties of oxygen anions. The bandwidth of this band becomes significantly
smaller than predicted by band structure calculations due to the orbital

the one of the few high-precision spectroscopic survey of radial velocities for
a large sample of bulge stars in such a low and positive latitude environment

in Nidever et al. 2012. The strong contamination of many observed spectra by
TiO bands prevented us from deriving the iron abundance for the entire
spectroscopic sample, introducing a selection bias. The metallicity
distribution was finally derived for a sub-sample of 112 stars in a magnitude
range where the effect of the selection bias is negligible. The distribution is
quite broad and roughly peaked at solar metallicity ([Fe/H]\simeq+0.05 dex)

numbers $\{D_{i,j}\}_{i,j \in \{1,...,n\}}$, we say that a positive-weighted
tree ${\cal T}=(T,w)$ realizes the family if $\{1,...,n\} \subset V(T)$ and
$D_{i,j}({\cal T})=D_{i,j}$ for any $ i,j \in \{1,...,n\}$.
  A characterization of $2$-dissimilarity families of positive weighted trees
is already known (see \cite{B}, \cite{SimP} or \cite{St}): the families must
satisfy the well-known \emph{four-point condition}. However we can wonder when
there exists a positive-weighted tree with \emph{exactly} $n$ vertices,
$1,...,n,$ and realizing the family $\{D_{i,j}\}$. In this paper we will show
that the four-point condition is necessary but no more sufficient, and so we
will introduce two additional conditions (see Theorem \ref{thm:ThmAgne}).

Here we develop methods for validating admixture models based on posterior

statistical model. We develop PPCs for five population-level statistics of
interest: within-population genetic variation, background linkage
disequilibrium, number of ancestral populations, between-population genetic

population structure in association studies. Using PPCs, we evaluate the
quality of the model estimates for four qualitatively different population

that the same model fitted to different genomic studies resulted in highly

PPCs for model-based analyses in large genomic studies.

paper presents the use of a simple robotic platform to assist the learning of
basic AI concepts. The study is guided through some simple experiments using
autonomous mobile robots. The central algorithm is the Learning Automata. Using
LA, each robot action is applied to an environment to be evaluated by means of
a fitness value. The response of the environment is used by the automata to
select its next action. This procedure holds until the goal task is reached.
The proposal addresses the AI study by offering in LA a unifying context to
draw together several of the topics of AI and motivating the students to learn

theory and experiment have a reached a certain level of maturity. The
development of theoretical models beyond \Lambda, or smooth dark energy, often
called modified gravity, has led to broader insights into a path forward, and a
host of observational and experimental tests have been developed. In this
review we present the current state of the field and describe a framework for
anticipating developments in the next decade. We identify the guiding
principles for rigorous and consistent modifications of the standard model, and
discuss the prospects for empirical tests. We begin by reviewing attempts to
consistently modify Einstein gravity in the infrared, focusing on the notion
that additional degrees of freedom introduced by the modification must screen
themselves from local tests of gravity. We categorize screening mechanisms into
three broad classes: mechanisms which become active in regions of high
Newtonian potential, those in which first derivatives become important, and
those for which second derivatives are important. Examples of the first class,
such as f(R) gravity, employ the familiar chameleon or symmetron mechanisms,
whereas examples of the last class are galileon and massive gravity theories,
employing the Vainshtein mechanism. In each case, we describe the theories as
effective theories. We describe experimental tests, summarizing laboratory and
solar system tests and describing in some detail astrophysical and cosmological
tests. We discuss future tests which will be sensitive to different signatures
of new physics in the gravitational sector. Parts that are more relevant to
theorists vs. observers/experimentalists are clearly indicated, in the hope
that this will serve as a useful reference for both audiences, as well as
helping those interested in bridging the gap between them.

approximation and even powers of $k$, i.e., $A_0 - A_2k^2 + A_4k^4 - ...$,
compensated at low $k$. With terms up to $k^4$ the model can predict the true
power spectrum to a few percent accuracy up to $k\sim 0.7 h \rm{Mpc}^{-1}$,
over a wide range of redshifts and models. The $A_n$ coefficients contain
information about cosmology, in particular amplitude of fluctuations. We write
a simple form of the covariance matrix as a sum of Gaussian part and $A_0$
variance, which reproduces the simulations remarkably well. In contrast, we
show that one needs an N-body simulation volume of more than 1000 $({\rm
Gpc}/h)^3$ to converge to 1\% accuracy on covariance matrix. We investigate the
super-sample variance effect and show it can be modeled as an additional
parameter that can be determined from the data. This allows a determination of
$\sigma_8$ amplitude to about 0.2\% for a survey volume of 1$({\rm Gpc}/h)^3$,
compared to 0.4\% otherwise. We explore the sensitivity of these coefficients
to baryonic effects using hydrodynamic simulations of van Daalen (2011). We
find that because of baryons redistributing matter inside halos all the
coefficients $A_{2n}$ for $n>0$ are strongly affected by baryonic effects,
while $A_0$ remains almost unchanged, a consequence of halo mass conservation.
Our results suggest that observations such as weak lensing power spectrum can
be effectively marginalized over the baryonic effects, while still preserving
the bulk of the cosmological information contained in $A_0$ and Zeldovich
terms.

coding. In a BM approach, image frames in a video sequence are divided into
blocks. For each block in the current frame, the best matching block is
identified inside a region of the previous frame, aiming to minimize the sum of
absolute differences (SAD). Unfortunately, the SAD evaluation is
computationally expensive and represents the most consuming operation in the BM
process. Therefore, BM motion estimation can be approached as an optimization
problem, where the goal is to find the best matching block within a search
space. The simplest available BM method is the full search algorithm (FSA)
which finds the most accurate motion vector through an exhaustive computation
of SAD values for all elements of the search window. Recently, several fast BM
algorithms have been proposed to reduce the number of SAD operations by
calculating only a fixed subset of search locations at the price of poor
accuracy. In this paper, a new algorithm based on Artificial Bee Colony (ABC)
optimization is proposed to reduce the number of search locations in the BM
process. In our algorithm, the computation of search locations is drastically
reduced by considering a fitness calculation strategy which indicates when it
is feasible to calculate or only estimate new search locations. Since the
proposed algorithm does not consider any fixed search pattern or any other
movement assumption as most of other BM approaches do, a high probability for
finding the true minimum (accurate motion vector) is expected. Conducted
simulations show that the proposed method achieves the best balance over other
fast BM algorithms, in terms of both estimation accuracy and computational
cost.

the latter contain bound states of groups of particles. We first focus on the

extensive, and it is saturated for highly-entangled states. As a function of
the eigenstate energy, the entanglement entropy is organized in bands. Their
number depends on the number of blocks of contiguous Bethe-Takahashi quantum
numbers. In presence of bound states a significant reduction in the
entanglement entropy occurs, reflecting that a group of bound particles behaves
effectively as a single particle. Interestingly, the associated entanglement
spectrum shows edge-related levels. At finite particle density, the
semiclassical bound S_MAX becomes inaccurate. For highly-entangled states
S_A\propto L_c, with L_c the chord length, signaling the crossover to extensive

correlations in solids at the ground state. In this paper we review the recent
development of the momentum-dependent local ansatz wavefunction (MLA). It is
constructed by taking into account two-particle excited states projected onto
the local orbitals, and the momentum-dependent amplitudes of these states are
chosen as variational parameters. The MLA describes accurately correlated
electron states from the weak to the intermediate Coulomb interaction regime in
infinite dimensions, and works well even in the strongly correlated region by
introducing a new starting wavefunction called the hybrid (HB) wavefunction.
The MLA-HB is therefore shown to overcome the limitation of the original local
ansatz (LA) wavefunction as well as the Gutzwiller wavefunction. In particular,
the calculated quasiparticle weight vs Coulomb interaction curve is shown to be
close to that obtained by the numerical renormalization group approach. It is
also shown that the MLA is applicable to the first-principles Hamiltonian.

  method for solving nonlinear multiscale partial differential
  equations. The proposed method combines empirical interpolation
  techniques and local multiscale methods, such as the Generalized
  Multiscale Finite Element Method (GMsFEM). To solve nonlinear
  equations, the GMsFEM is used to represent the solution on a coarse
  grid with multiscale basis functions computed offline. Computing
  the GMsFEM solution involves calculating the residuals on the fine
  grid. We use empirical interpolation concepts to evaluate the
  residuals and the Jacobians of the multiscale system with a
  computational cost which is proportional to the coarse scale problem
  rather than the fully-resolved fine scale one. Empirical
  interpolation methods use basis functions and an inexpensive
  inversion which are computed in the offline stage for finding the
  coefficients in the expansion based on a limited number of nonlinear
  function evaluations. The proposed multiscale empirical
  interpolation techniques: (1) divide computing the nonlinear
  function into coarse regions; (2) evaluate contributions of
  nonlinear functions in each coarse region taking advantage of a
  reduced-order representation of the solution; and (3) introduce
  multiscale proper-orthogonal-decomposition techniques to find
  appropriate interpolation vectors. We demonstrate the effectiveness
  of the proposed methods on several examples of nonlinear multiscale
  PDEs that are solved with Newton's methods and fully-implicit time
  marching schemes. Our numerical results show that the proposed
  methods provide a robust framework for solving nonlinear multiscale
  PDEs on a coarse grid with bounded error.

the notion of a thrifty resolution, also defined by Koll\'ar and Kov\'acs, and

in 2004 by the Observatoire pour l'Mineralogie, l'Eau les Glaces et l'Activite
(OMEGA) (Bibring et al., 2004). Three years later, the OMEGA instrument was
used to discover water ice deposited during southern summer on the polar cap
(Langevin et al., 2007). However, temporal and spatial variations of these
water ice signatures have remained unexplored, and the origins of these water
deposits remains an important scientific question. To investigate this
question, we have used observations from the Compact Reconnaissance Imaging
Spectrometer for Mars (CRISM) instrument on the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter
(MRO) spacecraft of the southern cap during austral summer over four Martian
years to search for variations in the amount of water ice.
  We report below that for each year we have observed the cap, the magnitude of
the H2O ice signature on the southern cap has risen steadily throughout summer,
particularly on the west end of the cap. The spatial extent of deposition is in
disagreement with the current best simulations of deposition of water ice on
the south polar cap (Montmessin et al., 2007).
  This increase in water ice signatures is most likely caused by deposition of
atmospheric H2O ice and a set of unusual conditions makes the quantification of
this transport flux using CRISM close to ideal. We calculate a 'minimum
apparent' amount of deposition corresponding to a thin H2O ice layer of 0.2mm
(with 70 percent porosity). This amount of H2O ice deposition is 0.6-6 percent
of the total Martian atmospheric water budget. We compare our 'minimal
apparent' quantification with previous estimates.
  This deposition process may also have implications for the formation and
stability of the southern CO2 ice cap, and therefore play a significant role in
the climate budget of modern day Mars.

the two-component accretion flow consisting of thermal particles and
high-energy particles, supposing that some fraction of the released energy is
converted to the acceleration of the high-energy particles. The thermal
component is governed by fluid dynamics while the high-energy particles obey
the moment equations of the diffusion-convection equation. By solving the time
evolution of these equations, we obtain advection dominated flows as the steady
state solutions. Effects of the high-energy particles on the flow structures
turn out to be small even if the pressure of the high-energy particles
dominates over the thermal pressure. For a model in which the escaping protons
take away almost all the released energy, the high-energy particles have large
influence enough to make the flow have the Keplerian angular velocity at the
inner region. We calculate the luminosities of the escaping particles for these
steady solutions. The escaping particles can extract the energy from about
$10^{-4}\dot M c^2$ to $10^{-2}\dot M c^2$, where $\dot M$ is the mass
accretion rates. The luminosities of the escaping particles depend on the
parameters such as the injection Lorentz factors, the mass accretion rates, and
the diffusion coefficients. We also discuss some implications on the

conductors is a result of dynamic quantum interference pattern due to motion of
defects. This has been firmly established by demonstrating the characteristic
partial suppression of the noise amplitude by the dephasing effect of a weak
external magnetic field. The spatial correlation of the quantum interference
pattern in disordered normal state conductors is invariably limited by the
exponential phase relaxation due to inelastic processes. In this paper we
develop a quantitative theory of the mesoscopic noise in the s-wave
superconducting phase of a strongly disordered superconductor (such that the
superconducting coherence length is much longer than the mean free path). We
find that the superconducting coherence length limits the quantum interference
effects in superconductors. However, in contrast to the normal phase, the decay
of the phase relaxation on the scale of the superconducting coherence length is
non-exponential. This unusual slow relaxation manifests in the enhanced
amplitude of the mesoscopic noise in superconductors and a peculiar non-linear
scaling of the amplitude with the strength/number of mobile defects in very
thin superconducting films and wires (effectively 2D and 1D with respect to the
superconducting coherence length). Mesoscopic noise sets a natural limit on the

the Collapsar model. In this model the engine has to operate long enough to
push the jet out of the stellar envelope and the observed duration of the burst
is the difference between the engine's operation time and the jet breakout

hydrodynamic during most of the time that its head is within the envelope of
the progenitor star and around the time when it emerges from the star. This
would naturally arise if the jet forms as a hydrodynamic jet in the first place

This leads us to introduce the new concept of composition entropy for single
phase systems that we do not assimilate to a mixing entropy. We then show that
they do not contribute to the thermodynamics of the system at fixed composition
and prescribe to substract $\ln N!$ from the free energy characterizing a
system however polydisperse it can be. We then re-derive general expressions
for the mixing entropy between any two polydisperse systems and interpret them
in term of distances between probability distributions and show that one of
these metrics relates naturally to a recent extension of Landauer's principle.
We then propose limiting expressions for the mixing entropy in the case of
mixing with equal proportion in the original compositions and finally address
the challenging problem of chemical reactions.

from standard 4D physics, a notion of matter and gravity localization on the
brane is crucial. In this work we investigate the localization of universal
massive scalar fields in a de Sitter thick tachyonic braneworld generated by
gravity coupled to a tachyonic bulk scalar field. This braneworld possesses a
4D de Sitter induced metric and is asymptotically flat despite the presence of
a negative bulk cosmological constant, a novel and interesting peculiarity that
contrasts with previously known models. Universal scalar fields can be
localized in this expanding braneworld if their bulk mass obeys an upper bound,
otherwise they delocalize: The dynamics of the scalar field is governed by a
Schroedinger equation with an analog quantum mechanical potential of modified
Poeschl-Teller type that depends on the bulk curvature of the braneworld system
and the value of the bulk scalar field mass. For masses satisfying a certain
upper bound, the potential displays a negative minimum and possesses a single
massless bound state separated from the Kaluza-Klein (KK) massive modes by a
mass gap defined by the Hubble (expansion scale) parameter of the 3-brane. As
the bulk scalar field mass increases, the minimum of the quantum mechanical
potential approaches a null value and, eventually, it becomes positive,
transforming into a potential barrier and leading to delocalization of the bulk
scalar field from the brane. The general solution of the Schroedinger equation
is given in terms of general Heun functions, giving rise to a new application

extragalactic dust and compare them to what is seen in the Galaxy; 2) to
address in an independent way the problem of the anomalous extinction curves
reported for reddened Type Ia Supernovae (SN) in connection to the environments
in which they explode. Methods: The properties of the dust are derived from the
wavelength dependence of the continuum polarization observed in four reddened
Type Ia SN: 1986G, 2006X, 2008fp, and 2014J. [...] Results: All four objects
are characterized by exceptionally low total-to-selective absorption ratios
(R_V) and display an anomalous interstellar polarization law, characterized by
very blue polarization peaks. In all cases the polarization position angle is
well aligned with the local spiral structure. While SN~1986G is compatible with
the most extreme cases of interstellar polarization known in the Galaxy,
SN2006X, 2008fp, and 2014J show unprecedented behaviours. The observed
deviations do not appear to be connected to selection effects related to the
relatively large amounts of reddening characterizing the objects in the sample.
Conclusions: The dust responsible for the polarization of these four SN is most
likely of interstellar nature. The polarization properties can be interpreted
in terms of a significantly enhanced abundance of small grains. The anomalous
behaviour is apparently associated with the properties of the galactic
environment in which the SN explode, rather than with the progenitor system
from which they originate. For the extreme case of SN2014J, we cannot exclude
the contribution of light scattered by local material; however, the observed
polarization properties require an ad hoc geometrical dust distribution.

using high temperatures, as in parallel tempering, or simulating with a biasing
potential such as in the case of umbrella sampling. The equilibrium properties
of the thermodynamic state of interest (e.g., lowest temperature or unbiased
potential) can be computed using reweighting estimators such as the weighted
histogram analysis method or the multistate Bennett acceptance ratio (MBAR).
weighted histogram analysis method and MBAR produce unbiased estimates, the
simulation samples from the global equilibria at their respective thermodynamic
state--a requirement that can be prohibitively expensive for some simulations
such as a large parallel tempering ensemble of an explicitly solvated

method (TRAM)--a class of estimators that exploit ideas from Markov modeling
and only require the simulation data to be in local equilibrium within subsets
of the configuration space. We formulate the expanded TRAM (xTRAM) estimator

four exemplary systems of varying complexity, we demonstrate the improved
convergence (ranging from a twofold improvement to several orders of magnitude)
of xTRAM in comparison to a direct counting estimator and MBAR, with respect to
the invested simulation effort. Lastly, we introduce a random-swapping
simulation protocol that can be used with xTRAM, gaining orders-of-magnitude
advantages over simulation protocols that require the constraint of sampling

information spectrum method, a sequence of codes of increasing blocklengths $n$
is designed to illustrate this tradeoff. Furthermore, for additive discrete
memoryless channels with uniform input distribution, we establish that our
analysis is tight with respect to the ensemble average. This is done by
analysing the ensemble performance in terms of a tradeoff between the code
rate, the undetected and the total errors. This tradeoff is parametrized by the
threshold in a generalized likelihood ratio test. Two asymptotic regimes are
studied. First, the code rate tends to the capacity of the channel at a rate
slower than $n^{-1/2}$ corresponding to the moderate deviations regime. In this
case, both error probabilities decay subexponentially and asymmetrically. The
precise decay rates are characterized. Second, the code rate tends to capacity
at a rate of $n^{-1/2}$. In this case, the total error probability is
asymptotically a positive constant while the undetected error probability
decays as $\exp(- b n^{ 1/2})$ for some $b>0$. The proof techniques involve
applications of a modified (or ""shifted"") version of the G\""artner-Ellis

infrastructure have on its spatial interactions remains a challenge. The
difficulty arises from the fact that the real impact may not be revealed in
static or aggregated mobility measures, as these are remarkably robust to
perturbations. More generally, the lack of longitudinal, cross-sectional data
demonstrating the evolution of spatial interactions at a meaningful urban scale
also hinders us from evaluating the sensitivity of movement indicators,
limiting our capacity to understand the evolution of urban mobility in depth.
Using very large mobility records distributed over three years we quantify the
impact of the completion of a metro line extension: the circle line (CCL) in
Singapore. We find that the commonly used movement indicators are almost
identical before and after the project was completed. However, in comparing the
temporal community structure across years, we do observe significant
differences in the spatial reorganization of the affected geographical areas.
The completion of CCL enables travelers to re-identify their desired
destinations collectively with lower transport cost, making the community
structure more consistent. These changes in locality are dynamic, and
characterized over short time-scales, offering us a different approach to
identify and analyze the long-term impact of new infrastructures on cities and
their evolution dynamics.

equivalent width of the FeII absorption lines down to a limit of W_r>1.5 \AA

systemic redshift of the galaxies from the [OII] emission line, we find that
both the FeII and MgII absorption lines are blueshifted, indicative that both
species trace gaseous outflows. We also find, however, that the FeII gas has
generally lower outflow velocity relative to that of MgII. We investigate the
variation of FeII line profiles as a function of the radiative transfer
properties of the lines, and find that transitions with higher oscillator
strengths are more blueshifted in terms of both line centroids and line wings.
We discuss the possibility that FeII lines are suppressed by stellar
absorptions. The lower velocities of the FeII lines relative to the MgII
doublet, as well as the absence of spatially extended FeII* emission in 2D
stacked spectra, suggest that most clouds responsible for the FeII absorption
lie close (3~4 kpc) to the disks of galaxies. We show that the FeII/FeII*
multiplets offer unique probes of the kinematic structure of galactic outflows.

trained, by means of linear regression, a scoring function defined as a linear
combination of the different factors, whose goal was to predict the user

predictive capabilities of the resulting functions.

GBM on board Fermi, since its launch in 2008. So far no neutrino event has been
associated with a GRB, despite many models predicting the generation of high
energy neutrinos through GRB photon interaction with PeV protons in the GRB
jet. We use the non-detection of neutrinos to constrain the hadronic content of
GRB jets independent of jet model parameters. Assuming a generic particle
spectrum of $E^{-\alpha}$ with $\alpha = 2$, we find that the ratio of the
energy carried by pions to that in electrons has to be small $f_\pi / f_e
\lesssim 0.24$ at 95\% confidence level. A distribution of spectral slopes can
lower $f_\pi / f_e$ by orders of magnitude. Another limit, independent of
neutrinos, is obtained if one ascribes the measured Fermi/LAT GeV gamma-ray
emission to pair-photon cascades of high-energy photons resulting from (the
same photon-hadronic interactions and subsequent) neutral pion decays. Based on
the generally observed MeV to GeV GRB fluence ratio of $\approx 10$, we show
that $f_\pi / f_e \lesssim 0.3$. In some bursts, where this ratio is as low as
unity, $f_\pi / f_e \lesssim 0.03$. These findings add to the mounting doubts
regarding the presence of PeV protons in GRB jets.

over wide wavelength ranges, without the need of purchasing a large number of
narrow-band filters covering all strong emission or absorption lines at any
redshift. However, one of its main features is a wavelength variation across
the field of view, sometimes termed the phase effect. In this work, an
anomalous phase effect is reported and characterized for the OSIRIS instrument
at the 10.4m Gran Telescopio Canarias. The transmitted wavelength across the
field of view of the instrument depends, not only on the distance to the
optical centre, but on wavelength. This effect is calibrated for the red
tunable filter of OSIRIS by measuring both normal-incidence light at laboratory
and spectral lamps at the telescope at non-normal incidence.
  This effect can be explained by taking into account the inner coatings of the
etalon. In a high spectral resolution etalon, the gap between plates is much
larger than the thickness of the inner reflective coatings. In the case of a
tunable filter, like that in OSIRIS, the coatings thickness could be of the
order of the cavity, which changes drastically the effective gap of the etalon.
We show that by including thick and dispersive coatings into the interference
equations, the observed anomalous phase effect can be perfectly reproduced. In
fact, we find that, for the OSIRIS red TF, a two-coatings model fits the data
with a rms of 0.5\AA\ at all wavelengths and incidence angles. This is a
general physical model that can be applied to other tunable-filter instruments.

structure of Cen A over 3.5 years. The proper motion analysis of individual jet
components allows us to constrain jet formation and propagation and to test the
proposed correlation of increased high energy flux with jet ejection events.
Cen A is an exceptional laboratory for such detailed study as its proximity
translates to unrivaled linear resolution, where 1 mas corresponds to 0.018 pc.
The first 7 epochs of high-resolution TANAMI VLBI observations at 8 GHz of Cen
A are presented, resolving the jet on (sub-)mas scales. They show a
differential motion of the sub-pc scale jet with significantly higher component
speeds further downstream where the jet becomes optically thin. We determined
apparent component speeds within a range of 0.1c to 0.3c, as well as identified
long-term stable features. In combination with the jet-to-counterjet ratio we
can constrain the angle to the line of sight to ~12{\deg} to 45{\deg}. The high
resolution kinematics are best explained by a spine-sheath structure supported
by the downstream acceleration occurring where the jet becomes optically thin.
On top of the underlying, continuous flow, TANAMI observations clearly resolve
individual jet features. The flow appears to be interrupted by an obstacle
causing a local decrease in surface brightness and a circumfluent jet behavior.
We propose a jet-star interaction scenario to explain this appearance. The
comparison of jet ejection times with high X-ray flux phases yields a partial
overlap of the onset of the X-ray emission and increasing jet activity, but the
limited data do not support a robust correlation.

of scintles is large and, hence, the statistical uncertainty in the scattering
delay is small. We used cyclic spectroscopy, still relatively novel in radio
astronomy, on baseband-sampled data to achieve unprecedented frequency
resolution while retaining adequate pulse phase resolution. We detected
scintillation structure in the spectra of the MSPs PSR B1257+12, PSR
J1810+1744, and PSR J2317+1439 with diffractive bandwidths of $6\pm 3$, $2.0\pm

performance of estimators for the polarization fraction and angle. These two
physical quantities suffer from a well-known bias in the presence of
measurement noise, as has been described in part I of this series. In this
paper, part II of the series, we explore the extent to which various estimators
may correct the bias. Traditional frequentist estimators of the polarization
fraction are compared with two recent estimators: one inspired by a Bayesian
analysis and a second following an asymptotic method. We investigate the
sensitivity of these estimators to the asymmetry of the covariance matrix which
may vary over large datasets. We present for the first time a comparison among
polarization angle estimators, and evaluate the statistical bias on the angle
that appears when the covariance matrix exhibits effective ellipticity. We also
address the question of the accuracy of the polarization fraction and angle
uncertainty estimators. The methods linked to the credible intervals and to the
variance estimates are tested against the robust confidence interval method.
From this pool of estimators, we build recipes adapted to different use-cases:
build a mask, compute large maps, and deal with low S/N data. More generally,
we show that the traditional estimators suffer from discontinuous distributions
at low S/N, while the asymptotic and Bayesian methods do not. Attention is
given to the shape of the output distribution of the estimators, and is
compared with a Gaussian. In this regard, the new asymptotic method presents
the best performance, while the Bayesian output distribution is shown to be
strongly asymmetric with a sharp cut at low S/N.Finally, we present an
optimization of the estimator derived from the Bayesian analysis using adapted

allowing us to reach a precision in radial-velocity measurements on the order
of 10 cm/s. At this level of precision, several noise sources that until now
have been outweighed by photon noise will start to contribute significantly to
the error budget. The telluric lines that are not neglected by the masks for
the radial velocity computation, here called micro-telluric lines, are one such
noise source. Aims: In this work we investigate the impact of micro-telluric
lines in the radial velocities calculations. We also investigate how to correct
the effect of these atmospheric lines on radial velocities. Methods: The work
presented here follows two parallel lines. First, we calculated the impact of
the micro-telluric lines by multiplying a synthetic solar-like stellar spectrum
by synthetic atmospheric spectra and evaluated the effect created by the
presence of the telluric lines. Then, we divided HARPS spectra by synthetic
atmospheric spectra to correct for its presence on real data and calculated the
radial velocity on the corrected spectra. When doing so, one considers two
atmospheric models for the synthetic atmospheric spectra: the LBLRTM and TAPAS.
Results: We find that the micro-telluric lines can induce an impact on the
radial velocities calculation that can already be close to the current
precision achieved with HARPS, and so its effect should not be neglected,
especially for future instruments such as ESPRESSO. Moreover, we find that the
micro-telluric lines' impact depends on factors, such as the radial velocity of
the star, airmass, relative humidity, and the barycentric Earth radial velocity
projected along the line of sight at the time of the observation.

cubic in momentum coupling suppresses weak localization without a change of the

understanding how turbulent convection transports energy and how magnetic
fields are distributed across the solar surface.
  Aims: From horizontal velocity measurements all over the visible disc of the
Sun and using data from the Solar Dynamics Observatory/Helioseismic and
Magnetic Imager (SDO/HMI), we investigate the structure and evolution of solar
supergranulation.
  Methods: Horizontal velocity fields were measured by following the proper
motions of solar granules using a newly developed version of the coherent
structure tracking (CST) code. With this tool, maps of horizontal divergence
were computed. We then segmented and identified supergranular cells and
followed their histories by using spatio-temporal labelling. With this dataset
we derived the fundamental properties of supergranulation, including their
motion.
  Results: We find values of the fundamental parameters of supergranulation
similar to previous studies: a mean lifetime of 1.5 days and a mean diameter of
25~Mm. The tracking of individual supergranular cells reveals the solar
differential rotation and a poleward circulation trend of the meridional flow.
The shape of the derived differential rotation and meridional flow does not
depend on the cell size. If there is a background magnetic field, the diverging
flows in supergranules are weaker.
  Conclusions: This study confirms that supergranules are suitable tracers that
may be used to investigate the large-scale flows of the solar convection as
long as they are detectable enough on the surface.

combines two different bibliometric approaches. The first approach to analyze
the 'EPS-HLS interface' is based on term map visualizations of HLS research
fields. We consider 16 clinical fields and five life science fields. On the
basis of expert judgment, EPS research in these fields is studied by
identifying EPS-related terms in the term maps. In the second approach, a
large-scale citation-based network analysis is applied to publications from all
fields of science. We work with about 22,000 clusters of publications, each
representing a topic in the scientific literature. Citation relations are used
to identify topics at the EPS-HLS interface. The two approaches complement each
other. The advantages of working with textual data compensate for the
limitations of working with citation relations and the other way around. An
important advantage of working with textual data is in the in-depth qualitative
insights it provides. Working with citation relations, on the other hand,
yields many relevant quantitative statistics. We find that EPS research
contributes to HLS developments mainly in the following five ways: new
materials and their properties; chemical methods for analysis and molecular
synthesis; imaging of parts of the body as well as of biomaterial surfaces;
medical engineering mainly related to imaging, radiation therapy, signal
processing technology, and other medical instrumentation; mathematical and
statistical methods for data analysis. In our analysis, about 10% of all EPS
and HLS publications are classified as being at the EPS-HLS interface. This
percentage has remained more or less constant during the past decade.

that for the three possible outcomes of these interactions - which are the
formation of an eccentric binary system, a lateral collision in which several
mass transfer episodes occur, and a direct one in which just a single mass
transfer episode takes place - only those in which an eccentric binary are
formed are likely to be detected by the planned gravitational wave mission
eLISA, while more sensitive detectors would be able to detect the signals
emitted in lateral collisions. On the other hand, the light curves (and the
thermal neutrino emission) of these interactions are considerably different,
producing both very powerful outbursts and low luminosity events. Finally, we
also calculate the X-ray signature produced in the aftermath of those
interactions for which a merger occurs. We find that the temporal evolution
follows a power law with the same exponent found in the case of the mergers of
two neutron stars, although the total energy released is smaller.

medium, as they dominate the ionisation of the dense molecular gas, where stars
and planets form. However, since they are efficiently scattered by the galactic
magnetic fields, many questions remain open, such as where exactly they are
accelerated, what is their original energy spectrum, and how they propagate
into molecular clouds. In this work we present new observations and discuss in
detail a method that allows us to measure the cosmic ray ionisation rate
towards the molecular clouds close to the W28 supernova remnant. To perform
these measurements, we use CO, HCO$^+$, and DCO$^+$ millimetre line
observations and compare them with the predictions of radiative transfer and
chemical models away from thermodynamical equilibrium. The CO observations
allow us to constrain the density, temperature, and column density towards each
observed position, while the DCO$^+$/HCO$^+$ abundance ratios provide us with
constraints on the electron fraction and, consequently, on the cosmic ray
ionisation rate. Towards positions located close to the supernova remnant, we
find cosmic ray ionisation rates much larger ($\gtrsim100$) than those in
standard galactic clouds. Conversely, towards one position situated at a larger
distance, we derive a standard cosmic ray ionisation rate. Overall, these
observations support the hypothesis that the $\gamma$ rays observed in the
region have a hadronic origin. In addition, based on CR diffusion estimates, we
find that the ionisation of the gas is likely due to $0.1 -1$ GeV cosmic rays.
Finally, these observations are also in agreement with the global picture of
cosmic ray diffusion, in which the low-energy tail of the cosmic ray population
diffuses at smaller distances than the high-energy counterpart.

called ribosomes, decode genetic information in the mRNA chain into the
corresponding proteins. Gene translation includes several steps. During the
elongation step, ribosomes move along the mRNA in a sequential manner and link
amino-acids together in the corresponding order to produce the proteins.
  The homogeneous ribosome flow model(HRFM) is a deterministic computational
model for translation-elongation under the assumption of constant elongation
rates along the mRNA chain. The HRFM is described by a set of n first-order
nonlinear ordinary differential equations, where n represents the number of
sites along the mRNA chain. The HRFM also includes two positive parameters:
ribosomal initiation rate and the (constant) elongation rate. In this paper, we
show that the steady-state translation rate in the HRFM is a concave function
of its parameters. This means that the problem of determining the parameter
values that maximize the translation rate is relatively simple. Our results may
contribute to a better understanding of the mechanisms and evolution of
translation-elongation. We demonstrate this by using the theoretical results to
estimate the initiation rate in M. musculus embryonic stem cell. The underlying
assumption is that evolution optimized the translation mechanism.
  For the infinite-dimensional HRFM, we derive a closed-form solution to the
problem of determining the initiation and transition rates that maximize the
protein translation rate. We show that these expressions provide good
approximations for the optimal values in the n-dimensional HRFM already for
relatively small values of n. These results may have applications for synthetic
biology where an important problem is to re-engineer genomic systems in order
to maximize the protein production rate.

Cu$_{\mathrm{In}/\mathrm{Ga}}$ act as shallow acceptors. Using total charge
neutrality of ionized defects and intrinsic charge carriers to determine the
Fermi level, we show that under In-rich growth conditions In$_{\mathrm{Cu}}$
causes strongly n-type conductivity in CuInSe$_{2}$. Under In-poor growth
conditions the conductivity type in CuInSe$_{2}$ alters to p-type and
compensation of the acceptors by In$_{\mathrm{Cu}}$ reduces, as observed in
photoluminescence experiments. In CuGaSe$_{2}$, the native acceptors pin the
Fermi level far away from the conduction band minimum, thus inhibiting n-type
conductivity. On the other hand, CuGaSe$_{2}$ shows strong p-type conductivity
under a wide range of Ga-poor growth conditions. Maximal p-type conductivity in
CuIn$_{1-x}$Ga$_x$Se$_{2}$ is reached under In/Ga-poor growth conditions, in
agreement with charge concentration measurements on samples with In/Ga-poor
stoichiometry, and is primarily due to the dominant acceptor
Cu$_{\mathrm{In}/\mathrm{Ga}}$.

  We will focus here on one specific such construction, discussing and

the free multiplicative Brownian motion when d goes to infinity. We shall first
recall that result and give an alternative proof for it. We shall then see how
this proof can be adapted in a more general context in order to get a free
L\'evy process on the dual group (in the sense of Voiculescu) U\langle

theorem for classical random variables, of the which Biane's result constitutes
the case n=1.

  Systems",,,,,"math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Particle filtering is a powerful approximation method that applies to state
estimation in nonlinear and non-Gaussian dynamical state-space models.
Unfortunately, the approximation error depends exponentially on the system
dimension. This means that an incredibly large number of particles may be
needed to appropriately control the error in very large scale filtering
problems. The computational burden required is often prohibitive in practice.
Rebeschini and Van Handel (2013) analyse a new approach for particle filtering
in large-scale dynamic random fields. Through a suitable localisation operation
they reduce the dependence of the error to the size of local sets, each of
which may be considerably smaller than the dimension of the original system.
The drawback is that this localisation operation introduces a bias. In this
work, we propose a modified version of Rebeschini and Van Handel's blocked
particle filter. We introduce a new degree of freedom allowing us to reduce the
bias. We do this by enlarging the space during the update phase and thus
reducing the amount of dependent information thrown away due to localisation.
By designing an appropriate tradeoff between the various tuning parameters it
is possible to reduce the total error bound via allowing a temporary
enlargement of the update operator without really increasing the overall
computational burden.

the monetary goods flows between industries, we study the network properties of
the so-called world input-output network (WION) and document its evolution over

assortativity, clustering coefficient, and degree and strength distributions,

of roughly 125 GeV was announced. This great success is now being followed by
the identification of the nature of this particle and the particle's properties
are being measured. One of these properties is the Higgs boson mass which is
already known very precisely with an experimental uncertainty of below 1 GeV.
In some extensions of the Standard Model, like in supersymmetric extensions,
the Higgs boson mass can be predicted and hence, the measured mass constrains
the parameters of the model. For a full exploitation of this constraint, a
precise theoretical prediction is needed. The presented combination of the
results obtained by the Feynman diagrammatic approach and the renormalization
group equation approach improves the known Higgs mass prediction for larger
mass scales of the superpartner particles.

considered which contain a toroidal magnetic background field with the same
radial profile as the linear azimuthal velocity. Chandrasekhar (1956) has shown
for ideal fluids the stability of this configuration if the Alfven velocity of
the field equals the velocity of the background flow. It is demonstrated for
magnetized Taylor-Couette flows at the Rayleigh line, however, that for finite
diffusivity such flows become unstable against nonaxisymmetric perturbations
where the critical magnetic Reynolds number of the rotation rate does not
depend on the magnetic Prandtl number Pm if Pm much << 1. In order to study
this new diffusive azimuthal magnetorotational instability, flows and fields
with the same radial profile but with different amplitudes are considered. For
Pm << 1 the instability domain with the weakest fields and the slowest rotation
rates lies below the Chandrasekhar line of equal amplitudes for Alfven velocity
and rotation velocity. We find that then the lines of marginal instability
scale with the Reynolds number and the Hartmann number. The minimum values of
the field strength and the rotation rate which are needed for the instability
(slightly) grow for more and more flat rotation. Finally, the corresponding
electric current of the background field becomes so strong that the Tayler
instability (which even exists without rotation) also appears in the
bifurcation map at small Hartmann numbers displacing after all the azimuthal
magnetorotational instability.

the previous convolution theorem.

and $M(n)$ to be the number of minimal elements of ${\sf Q}_n$ where $M(0)=1$.
Then a sequence of numbers $\{r_n({\sf Q}_n)\}_{n\ge 1}$ is defined by the
equation \begin{eqnarray*} \sum_{n\ge 1}r_n({\sf

poset ${\sf Q}_n$. Furthermore, let $\mu_{{\sf Q}_n}$ be the M\""{o}bius
function on the poset $\bar{{\sf Q}}_n$. Stanley proved that $r_n({\sf

$r_n({\sf Q}_n)$ are integers. In this paper, we study the cases ${\sf

Q}_n^{(r)}$ are posets, respectively, of set partitions of $[rn]$ whose block
sizes are divisible by $r$ and of $r$-partitions of $[n]$. In both cases we
prove that $r_n(\Pi_n^{(r)})$ and $r_n({\sf Q}_n^{(r)})$ enumerate the pyramids
by applying the Cartier-Foata monoid identity and further prove that
$r_n(\Pi_n^{(r)})$ is the generalized Euler number $E_{rn-1}$ and that
$r_n({\sf Q}_n^{(2)})$ is the number of complete non-ambiguous trees of size
$2n-1$ by bijections. This gives a new proof of Welker's theorem that
$r_n(\Pi_n^{(r)})=E_{rn-1}$ and implies the construction of $r$-dimensional
complete non-ambiguous trees. As a bonus of applying the theory of heaps, we
establish a bijection between the set of complete non-ambiguous forests and the
set of pairs of permutations with no common rise. This answers an open question
raised by Aval {\it et al.}.

$T=T(\varepsilon)$ and $C=C(\varepsilon)$ such that $f'(t)\leq

for $f'(u)$ for every $p<3$ and $n\geq 2$. Under a similar but more restrictive

burning in a convective shell tends to propagate to the centre. Whether the C
flame will actually be able to reach the centre depends on the efficiency of
extra mixing beneath the C convective shell. Whereas thermohaline mixing is too
inefficient to interfere with the C-flame propagation, convective boundary
mixing can prevent the C burning from reaching the centre. As a result, a
C-O-Ne white dwarf (WD) is formed, after the star has lost its envelope. Such a
""hybrid"" WD has a small CO core surrounded by a thick ONe zone. In our 1D
stellar evolution computations, the hybrid WD is allowed to accrete C-rich
material, as if it were in a close binary system and accreted H-rich material
from its companion with a sufficiently high rate at which the accreted H would
be processed into He under stationary conditions, assuming that He could then
be transformed into C. When the mass of the accreting WD approaches the
Chandrasekhar limit, we find a series of convective Urca shell flashes
associated with high abundances of 23Na and 25Mg. They are followed by
off-centre C ignition leading to convection that occupies almost the entire
star. To model the Urca processes, we use the most recent well-resolved data
for their reaction and neutrino-energy loss rates. Because of the emphasized
uncertainty of the convective Urca process in our hybrid WD models of SN Ia
progenitors, we consider a number of their potentially possible alternative
instances for different mixing assumptions, all of which reach a phase of
explosive C ignition, either off or in the centre. Our hybrid SN Ia progenitor
models have much lower C to O abundance ratios at the moment of the explosive C
ignition than their pure CO counterparts, which may explain the observed
diversity of the SNe Ia.

First we discuss cloud formation by cloud-cloud collisions, and gravitational

densities and the latter at higher. Cloud masses are also limited by stellar
feedback, which can be effective before clouds reach their maximum mass. We
show other properties of clouds in simulations with different levels of
feedback. With a moderate level of feedback, properties such as cloud rotations
and virial parameters agree with observations. Without feedback, an unrealistic
population of overly bound clouds develops. Spiral arms are not found to
trigger star formation, they merely gather gas into more massive GMCs. We
discuss in more detail interactions of clouds in the ISM, and argue that these

Its
non-trivial embedding in supergravity was intensively studied in the recent
literature, whereas its interplay with supersymmetry breaking has been less
thoroughly investigated. We consider the minimal viable model of chaotic
inflation in supergravity containing a stabilizer field, and add a Polonyi
field. Furthermore, we study two possible extensions of the minimal setup. We
show that there are various constraints: first of all, it is very hard to
couple an O'Raifeartaigh sector with the inflaton sector, the simplest viable
option being to couple them only through gravity. Second, even in the simplest
model the gravitino mass is bounded from above parametrically by the inflaton
mass. Therefore, high-scale supersymmetry breaking is hard to implement in a
chaotic inflation setup. As a separate comment we analyze the simplest chaotic
inflation construction without a stabilizer field, together with a
supersymmetrically stabilized Kahler modulus. Without a modulus, the potential
of such a model is unbounded from below. We show that a heavy modulus cannot
solve this problem.

abiotic processes in the Solar System, with the exception of biogenic organics

prebiotic perspectives but also for overall comprehension of organic formation
in the young solar system and in planetary atmospheres. We have investigated
abiotic synthesis of organics upon plasma discharge, with special attention to
N isotope fractionation. Organic aerosols were synthesized from N2-CH4 and
N2-CO gaseous mixtures using low-pressure plasma discharge experiments, aimed
at simulating chemistry occurring in Titan s atmosphere and in the protosolar
nebula, respectively. Nitrogen is efficiently incorporated into the synthesized
solids, independently of the oxidation degree, of the N2 content of the
starting gas mixture, and of the nitrogen speciation in the aerosols. The
aerosols are depleted in 15N by 15-25 permil relative to the initial N2 gas,
whatever the experimental setup is. Such an isotopic fractionation is
attributed to mass-dependent kinetic effect(s). Nitrogen isotope fractionation
upon electric discharge cannot account for the large N isotope variations
observed among solar system objects and reservoirs. Extreme N isotope
signatures in the solar system are more likely the result of self-shielding
during N2 photodissociation, exotic effect during photodissociation of N2
and/or low temperature ion-molecule isotope exchange. Kinetic N isotope
fractionation may play a significant role in the Titan s atmosphere. We also
suggest that the low delta15N values of Archaean organic matter are partly the
result of abiotic synthesis of organics that occurred at that time.

pulsator. The system harbours four planetary-mass companions detected by direct
imaging, and is a good solar system analogue. The masses of the companions are
not known accurately, because the estimation depends strongly on the age of the
system, which is also not known with sufficient accuracy. Asteroseismic studies
of the star might help to better constrain the age of HR 8799. We organized an
extensive photometric and multi-site spectroscopic observing campaign for
studying the pulsations of the central star.
  Aims: The aim of the present study is to investigate the pulsation properties
of HR 8799 in detail via the ultra-precise 47-d-long nearly continuous
photometry obtained with the MOST space telescope, and to find as many
independent pulsation modes as possible, which is the prerequisite of an
asteroseismic age determination.
  Methods: We carried out Fourier analysis of the wide-band photometric time
series.
  Results: We find that resonance and sudden amplitude changes characterize the
pulsation of HR 8799. The dominant frequency is always at f1 = 1.978 c/d. Many
multiples of one ninth of the dominant frequency appear in the Fourier spectrum
of the MOST data: n/9 f1, where n={1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 13, 14, 17,
18}. Our analysis also reveals that many of these peaks show strong amplitude
decrease and phase variations even on the 47-d time-scale. The dependencies
between the pulsation frequencies of HR 8799 make the planned subsequent
asteroseismic analysis rather difficult. We point out some resemblance between
the light curve of HR 8799 and the modulated pulsation light curves of Blazhko
RR Lyrae stars.

relativistically drifting plasma, a violent numerical instability known as the
numerical Cerenkov instability (NCI) occurs. The NCI is due to the unphysical
coupling of electromagnetic waves on a grid to wave-particle resonances,
including aliased resonances, i.e., $\omega + 2\pi\mu/\Delta t=(k_1+
2\pi\nu_1/\Delta x_1)v_0$, where $\mu$ and $\nu_1$ refer to the time and space
aliases and the plasma is drifting relativistically at velocity $v_0$ in the
$\hat{1}$-direction. Recent studies have shown that an EM-PIC code which uses a
spectral field solver and a low pass filter can eliminate the fastest growing
modes of the NCI. Based on these studies a new spectral PIC code for studying
laser wakefield acceleration (LWFA) in the Lorentz boosted frame was developed.
However, we show that for parameters of relevance for LWFA simulations in the
boosted frame, a relativistically drifting plasma is susceptible to a host of
additional unstable modes with lower growth rates, and that these modes appear
when the fastest growing unstable modes are filtered out. We show that these
modes are most easily identified as the coupling between modes which are purely
transverse (EM) and purely longitudinal (Langmuir) in the rest frame of the
plasma for specific time and space aliases. We rewrite the dispersion relation
of the drifting plasma for a general field solver and obtain analytic
expressions for the location and growth rate for each unstable mode, i.e, for
each time and space aliased resonances. We show for the spectral solver that
when the fastest growing mode is eliminated a new mode at the fundamental
resonance ($\mu=\nu_1=0$) can be seen. (Please check the whole abstract in the

magnetically mediated collisions. The magnetic enhancement to the collisional
cross-section between the iron rich dust results in rapid grain growth leading

strategies. In order to derive precise mathematical results, we use a simple
haploid, asexual model. In general, we show that eusocial reproductive
strategies are unlikely to materialize unless large fitness advantages are
gained by the production of only a few workers. These fitness advantages are
maximized through obligate rather than facultative eusocial strategies.
Furthermore, we find that solitary reproduction is `unbeatable' as long as the
solitary reproductive ratio exceeds a critical value. In these cases, no
eusocial parameters exist that would reduce their probability of extinction.
Our results help to explain why the number of solitary species exceeds that of
eusocial ones: eusociality is a high risk, high reward strategy, while solitary
reproduction is better at risk management.

high-throughput sequenced sample is an important task in metagenomics
applications. Since the sample sequence data typically harbors reads of
variable lengths and different levels of biological and technical noise,
accurate statistical analysis of such data is challenging. Currently popular
estimation methods are typically very time consuming in a desktop computing
environment.
  Results: Using sparsity enforcing methods from the general sparse signal
processing field (such as compressed sensing), we derive a solution to the
community composition estimation problem by a simultaneous assignment of all
sample reads to a pre-processed reference database. A general statistical model
based on kernel density estimation techniques is introduced for the assignment
task and the model solution is obtained using convex optimization tools.
Further, we design a greedy algorithm solution for a fast solution. Our
approach offers a reasonably fast community composition estimation method which
is shown to be more robust to input data variation than a recently introduced
related method.

elastic moduli. Recent theoretical work has also focused on the response of
such networks to finite or large deformations, both near and below the
isostatic point. Despite this interest, experimental evidence for the existence
of criticality in such networks has been lacking. Using computer simulations,
we identify critical signatures in the mechanical response of sub-isostatic

autonomous swarms of mobile robots that self-organize and cooperate to solve
global objectives. The overwhelming majority of works so far considers handmade
algorithms and correctness proofs. This paper is the first to propose a formal
framework to automatically design dis- tributed algorithms that are dedicated
to autonomous mobile robots evolving in a discrete space. As a case study, we
consider the problem of gathering all robots at a particular location, not
known beforehand. Our contribution is threefold. First, we propose an encoding
of the gathering problem as a reachability game. Then, we automatically
generate an optimal distributed algorithm for three robots evolv- ing on a
fixed size uniform ring. Finally, we prove by induction that the generated
algorithm is also correct for any ring size except when an impossibility result
holds (that is, when the number of robots divides the ring size).

Einstein locality and causality is designed and employed. Random A and B from
dice and coins, but based on a local model, run ""parallel"" to a real

Different from existing denoising algorithms which search for patches from
either the noisy image or a generic database, the new algorithm finds patches
from a database that contains only relevant patches. We formulate the denoising
problem as an optimal filter design problem and make two contributions. First,
we determine the basis function of the denoising filter by solving a group
sparsity minimization problem. The optimization formulation generalizes
existing denoising algorithms and offers systematic analysis of the
performance. Improvement methods are proposed to enhance the patch search
process. Second, we determine the spectral coefficients of the denoising filter
by considering a localized Bayesian prior. The localized prior leverages the
similarity of the targeted database, alleviates the intensive Bayesian
computation, and links the new method to the classical linear minimum mean
squared error estimation. We demonstrate applications of the proposed method in
a variety of scenarios, including text images, multiview images and face
images. Experimental results show the superiority of the new algorithm over
existing methods.

  Outcomes Directly",,,,"ci-2014/76","cs.GT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Prediction markets are often used as mechanisms to aggregate information
about a future event, for example, whether a candidate will win an election.
The event is typically assumed to be exogenous. In reality, participants may
influence the outcome, and therefore (1) running the prediction market could
change the incentives of participants in the process that creates the outcome
(for example, agents may want to change their vote in an election), and (2)
simple results such as the myopic incentive compatibility of proper scoring
rules no longer hold in the prediction market itself. We introduce a model of
games of this kind, where agents first trade in a prediction market and then
take an action that influences the market outcome. Our two-stage two-player
model, despite its simplicity, captures two aspects of real-world prediction
markets: (1) agents may directly influence the outcome, (2) some of the agents
instrumental in deciding the outcome may not take part in the prediction
market. We show that this game has two different types of perfect Bayesian
equilibria, which we term LPP and HPP, depending on the values of the belief
parameters: in the LPP domain, equilibrium prices reveal expected market
outcomes conditional on the participants' private information, whereas HPP
equilibria are collusive -- participants effectively coordinate in an
uninformative and untruthful way.
