desynchronized behaviour that was discovered in networks of nonlocally coupled
identical phase oscillators over ten years ago. Since then, chimeras were found
in numerous theoretical and experimental studies and more recently in models of
neuronal dynamics as well. In this work, we consider a generic model for a
saddle-node bifurcation on a limit cycle representative for neural excitability
type I. We obtain chimera states with multiple coherent regions (clustered
chimeras/multi-chimeras) depending on the distance from the excitability
threshold, the range of nonlocal coupling as well as the coupling strength. A
detailed stability diagram for these chimera states as well as other
interesting coexisting patterns like traveling waves are presented.

leveraged investors such as banks that invest in stocks and manage their risk
using a Value-at-Risk constraint, based on historical observations of asset
prices. The Value-at-Risk constraint implies that when perceived risk is low,
leverage is high and vice versa, a phenomenon that has been dubbed pro-cyclical
leverage. We show that this leads to endogenous irregular oscillations, in
which gradual increases in stock prices and leverage are followed by drastic
market collapses, i.e. a leverage cycle. This phenomenon is studied using
simplified models that give a deeper understanding of the dynamics and the
nature of the feedback loops and instabilities underlying the leverage cycle.
We introduce a flexible leverage regulation policy in which it is possible to
continuously tune from pro-cyclical to countercyclical leverage. When the
policy is sufficiently countercyclical and bank risk is sufficiently low the
endogenous oscillation disappears and prices go to a fixed point. While there
is always a leverage ceiling above which the dynamics are unstable,
countercyclical leverage can be used to raise the ceiling. We also study the
impact on leverage cycles of direct, temporal control of the bank's riskiness
via the bank's required Value-at-Risk quantile. Under such a rule the regulator
relaxes the Value-at-Risk quantile following a negative stock price shock and
tightens it following a positive shock. While such a policy rule can reduce the
amplitude of leverage cycles, its effectiveness is highly dependent on the
choice of parameters. Finally, we investigate fixed limits on leverage and show
how they can control the leverage cycle.

implications on the performance of the Cloud system. One of the major issues is
handling technical aspects of distributing the tasks for targeted gains and the
second issue is related to the handling of the business priority for
concurrently resolving business complexity related to cloud consumers. A
coordinated scheduling can be achieved by considering the weightage of both
aspects viz. technical requirements and business requirements appropriately. It
can be done in such a way that it meets the QoS requirements of technical
domain as well as business domain. Along with the technical priority a business
Bp is required in creating a resultant priority which could be given to stages
of further processing, like task allocation and arbitration schemes. Here we
consider a technical priority Tp that is governed by a semi-adaptive scheduling
algorithm whereas the resultant priority is derived in which a Business
Priority Bp layer encapsulates the Technical Priority Tp to achieve the overall
priority of the incoming tasks. It results in a Hybrid priority creation, which
is a combination of both technical priority Tp and business priority Bp. By
taking into account the business priority of the jobs it is possible to achieve
a higher service level satisfaction for the tasks which are submitted with
their native technical priority. With this approach the waiting time of the
tasks tends to get reduced and it gives a better service level satisfaction.

  temporal prediction","Doctoral thesis (May 2014)",,,,"q-bio.NC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The physics of the environment provide a rich spatiotemporal structure for
our experience. Objects move in predictable ways and their features and
identity remain stable across time and space. How does the brain leverage this
structure to make predictions about and learn from the environment? This thesis
describes research centered around a mechanistic description of sensory
prediction called LeabraTI (TI: Temporal Integration) that explains precisely
how predictive processing is accomplished in neocortical microcircuits. The
fundamental prediction of LeabraTI is that predictions and sensations are
interleaved across the same neural tissue at an overall rate of 10 Hz,
corresponding to the widely studied alpha rhythm of posterior cortex.
Experiments described herein tested this prediction by manipulating the
spatiotemporal properties of three-dimensional object stimuli in a laboratory
setting. EEG results indicated that predictions were subserved by ~10 Hz
oscillations that reliably tracked the onset of stimuli and differentiated
between spatially predictable and unpredictable object sequences. There was a
behavioral advantage for combined spatial and temporal predictability for
discrimination of unlearned objects, but prolonged study of objects under this
combined predictability context impaired discriminability relative to other
learning contexts. This counterintuitive pattern of results was accounted for
by a neural network model that learned three-dimensional viewpoint invariance
with LeabraTI's spatiotemporal prediction rule. Synaptic weight scaling from
prolonged learning built viewpoint invariance, but led to confusion between
ambiguous views of objects, producing slightly lower performance on average.
Overall, this work advances a biological architecture for sensory prediction
accompanied by empirical evidence that supports learning of realistic time- and
space-varying inputs.

local alignment entropy to all orders. We show that this nonlinear correction
maintains maximum entropy during equilibrium fluctuations. Indeed, as with the
usual resolution of Gibbs' paradox that avoids net entropy reduction during
reversible processes, the correction yields the statistics of indistinguishable
particles. The correction also ensures conservation of energy if an
instantaneous contribution from local entropy is included. Thus, a common
mechanism for 1/f noise comes from assuming that finite-size fluctuations
strictly obey the laws of thermodynamics, even in small parts of a large

Planetary Motions. The general proof of his wonderful statement (that he
provided completely only for the particular case of three bodies constrained in
a plane) turned out to be more difficult than expected and was next completed
by J. Laskar, P. Robutel, M. Herman, J. F\'ejoz, L. Chierchia and the author.
We refer the reader to the technical papers \cite{arnold63, laskarR95, rob95,

of \cite{pinzari13} for reviews.
  The complete understanding of Arnold's Theorem relied on an analytic part and
a geometric one, both highly non trivial. Of such two aspects, the analytic
part was basically settled out since \cite{arnold63} (notwithstanding
refinements next given in \cite{fejoz04, chierchiaPi10}). The geometrical
aspects were instead mostly unexplored after his 1963's paper and have been
only recently clarified \cite{pinzari-th09, chierchiaPi11b}. In fact, switching
from the three--body case to the many--body one needed to develop new
constructions, because of a dramatic degeneracy due to its invariance by
rotations, which, if not suitably treated, prevents the application of Arnold's
1963's strategy.

recently in relation with the transport and gap opening problems. Attaching an
impurity atom to graphene is believed to lead to the creation of unusual zero
energy localized electron states. This paper aims to describe the behavior of
the localized impurity-induced levels in graphene in a quantizing magnetic
field. It is shown that in the magnetic field the impurity level effectively
hybridizes with one of the n=0 Landau level states and splits into two
opposite-energy states. The new hybridized state is doubly occupied, forming a
spin-singlet and reducing the polarization of a Quantum Hall ferromagnet in
undoped graphene. Taking into account the electron-electron interaction changes
radically the spectrum of the electrons surrounding the impurity, which should
be seen experimentally. While existing publications investigate graphene
uniformly covered by adatoms, here we address a possibly even more
experimentally relevant case of the clusterized impurity distribution. The
limit of a dense bunch of the impurity atoms is considered, and it is shown,
how such a bunch changes the spectrum and spin polarization of a large dense
electron droplet surrounding it. The droplet is encircled by an edge state
carrying a persistent current.

Furthermore, in order to minimize the cardinality of the set of Fourier

of randomness is far more complex than the notion of uniform random sampling
often considered in the theoretical results of compressed sensing. The purpose
of this paper is to derive recovery guarantees in the case where the sampling
set is drawn in a non-uniform random manner. We will show how the sampling set

construct the Gaussian null co-ordinate system for the neighborhood of a

$\Omega$ for positive linear combinations $S$ of probabilities of events, $S

of a graph called the exclusivity graph of $S$. In the case that events
correspond to the outcomes of quantum projective measurements, quantum
probabilities are intimately related to the Gr\""otschel-Lov\'asz-Schrijver
theta body of the exclusivity graph. Then, one can easily compute an upper
bound to the maximum quantum violation of any NC or Bell inequality by
optimizing $S$ over the theta body and calculating the Lov\'asz number of the
corresponding exclusivity graph. In some cases, this upper bound is tight and
gives the exact maximum quantum violation. However, in general, this is not the
case. The reason is that the exclusivity graph does not distinguish among the
different ways exclusivity can occur in Bell-inequality (and similar)
scenarios. An interesting question is whether there is a graph-theoretical
concept which accounts for this problem. Here we show that, for any given
$N$-partite Bell inequality, an edge-coloured multigraph composed of $N$
single-colour graphs can be used to encode the relationships of exclusivity
between each party's parts of the events. Then, the maximum quantum violation
of the Bell inequality is exactly given by a refinement of the Lov\'asz number
that applies to these edge-coloured multigraphs. We show how to calculate upper
bounds for this number using a hierarchy of semi-definite programs and
calculate upper bounds for $I_3$, $I_{3322}$ and the three bipartite Bell

on the theoretical expectation that the tangential shear pattern around

statistically with an offset distance of several lensing smoothing scales by
using the standard reconstruction of surface mass density maps from weak
lensing observation. We test the idea using high-resolution cosmological

a number of such subhalos, the characteristic mass and offset length can be
also estimated on a statistical basis. We perform a Fisher analysis to show how
well upcoming weak lensing surveys can constrain the mass density profile of
satellite galaxies. In the case of the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope with a

learning algorithms for its strong theoretical guarantees. By casting the
learning problem as a local kernel approximation, KBRL provides a way of
computing a decision policy which is statistically consistent and converges to
a unique solution. Unfortunately, the model constructed by KBRL grows with the
number of sample transitions, resulting in a computational cost that precludes
its application to large-scale or on-line domains. In this paper we introduce
an algorithm that turns KBRL into a practical reinforcement learning tool.
Kernel-based stochastic factorization (KBSF) builds on a simple idea: when a
transition matrix is represented as the product of two stochastic matrices, one
can swap the factors of the multiplication to obtain another transition matrix,
potentially much smaller, which retains some fundamental properties of its
precursor. KBSF exploits such an insight to compress the information contained
in KBRL's model into an approximator of fixed size. This makes it possible to
build an approximation that takes into account both the difficulty of the
problem and the associated computational cost. KBSF's computational complexity
is linear in the number of sample transitions, which is the best one can do
without discarding data. Moreover, the algorithm's simple mechanics allow for a
fully incremental implementation that makes the amount of memory used
independent of the number of sample transitions. The result is a kernel-based
reinforcement learning algorithm that can be applied to large-scale problems in
both off-line and on-line regimes. We derive upper bounds for the distance
between the value functions computed by KBRL and KBSF using the same data. We
also illustrate the potential of our algorithm in an extensive empirical study
in which KBSF is applied to difficult tasks based on real-world data.

we obtain a flexible family of code ensembles with varying rates and frame
lengths that can share the same encoding and decoding architecture for
arbitrary L. We demonstrate that the resulting codes combine the best features
of optimized irregular and regular codes in one design: capacity approaching
iterative belief propagation (BP) decoding thresholds and linear growth of
minimum distance with block length. In particular, we show that, for
sufficiently large L, the BP thresholds on both the binary erasure channel
(BEC) and the binary-input additive white Gaussian noise channel (AWGNC)
saturate to a particular value significantly better than the BP decoding
threshold and numerically indistinguishable from the optimal maximum
a-posteriori (MAP) decoding threshold of the uncoupled LDPC code. When all
variable nodes in the coupled chain have degree greater than two,
asymptotically the error probability converges at least doubly exponentially
with decoding iterations and we obtain sequences of asymptotically good LDPC
codes with fast convergence rates and BP thresholds close to the Shannon limit.
Further, the gap to capacity decreases as the density of the graph increases,

  We present an efficient algorithm, using exact linear algebra, for testing

corrections to their antenna patterns which in principle can affect the outcome
of the associated data-analysis algorithms. The magnitude of these corrections
and the corresponding systematic errors have recently been estimated for
searches of periodic and stochastic gravitational waves (CQG 25 (2008) 184017).

traditional semi-rigorous approach which does not properly take into account
the curved nature of spacetime. The question then arises as to whether the
results will be the same if the calculation is done within the rigorous
framework of general relativity. In this paper we provide such a derivation of
the response of the detectors to gravitational waves. We obtain the photon
propagation time from the solution of the equation for null geodesics and

models therefore predict a right-handed charged gauge boson W_R in the TeV

events which are consistent with the cross section predicted in the D parity

would in general be a direct signal of new physics beyond the Standard Model at
the LHC. A TeV scale W_R would for example not only rule out SU(5) grand
unified theory models. It would also imply B-L violation at the TeV scale,

because some of the metrics are fuzzy or vague and the classical ranking of
routes and transitivity in the ranking does not hold. The proposed
Nontransitive Route Ranking subjective comparison of one route with others and
performs nontransitive ranking to rank routes from best to worst. The pairwise

Bi3O2S3 super-conductor is categorized as the typical type-II supercon-ductor
based on the results of both temperature and mag-netic field dependences of
magnetization. Hall coefficient measurements give evidence of a multiband
character, with a dominant conduction mainly by electron-like charge carriers.
The charge carrier density is about 1.45 X 1019 cm3, suggesting that the system
has very low charge carrier density.

phenomenology, from flavour physics to Higgs characterisation and as a window
to new physics, appearing both as signals and irreducible background in BSM
searches. These processes can be described in QCD either in a 4-flavor or
5-flavor scheme. In the former, $b$ quarks appear only in the final state and
are considered massive. In 5-flavor schemes, calculations include $b$ quarks in
the initial state. Possibly large logarithms originating from the collinear
splitting of gluons into bottom pairs are resummed into the $b$ parton
distribution function (PDF). In this contribution, I describe a simple method
to assess the size of the logarithms in processes initiated by bottom quarks
and show how a substantial and justified agreement between calculations in the
two schemes can be achieved. As a consequence both calculations can be used in
different context. To conclude, an overview of the current studies aiming to
generalise the current appraisal is given and some preliminary results are
discussed.

  Physics A: Mathematical and Theoretical",,,,"quant-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Inspired by the work done by Belavkin [Belavkin V. P., Stochastics, 1, 315
(1975)], and independently by Mochon, [Phys. Rev. A 73, 032328, (2006)], we
formulate the problem of minimum error discrimination of any ensemble of $n$
linearly independent pure states by stripping the problem of its rotational
covariance and retaining only the rotationally invariant aspect of the problem.
This is done by embedding the optimal conditions in a matrix equality as well
as matrix inequality. Employing the implicit function theorem in these
conditions we get a set of first-order coupled ordinary non-linear differential
equations which can be used to drag the solution from an initial point (where
solution is known) to another point (whose solution is sought). This way of
obtaining the solution can be done through a simple Taylor series expansion and
analytic continuation when required. Thus, we \emph{complete} the work done by
Belavkin and Mochon by ultimately leading their theory to a solution for the
minimum error discrimination problem of linearly independent pure state
ensembles. We also compare the computational complexity of our technique with a
barrier-type interior point method of SDP and show that our technique is
computationally as efficient as (actually, a bit more than) the SDP algorithm,
with the added advantage of being much simpler to implement.

It is one of the most
classical problems, the solutions of which represent the level of understanding
of gravitation in a given epoch. A {\it gedankenexperiment} in a modern frame
is given by a small body, like a compact star or a solar mass black hole,
captured by a supermassive black hole. The mass of the small body itself and
the emission of gravitational radiation cause the departure from the geodesic
path due to the back-action, that is the self-force. For radial fall, as any
other non-adiabatic motion, the instantaneous identity of the radiated energy
and the loss of orbital energy cannot be imposed and provide the perturbed
trajectory. In the first part of this letter, we present the effects due to the
self-force computed on the geodesic trajectory in the background field.
Compared to the latter trajectory, in the Regge-Wheeler, harmonic and all
others smoothly related gauges, a far observer concludes that the self-force
pushes inward (not outward) the falling body, with a strength proportional to
the mass of the small body for a given large mass; further, the same observer
notes an higher value of the maximal coordinate velocity, this value being
reached earlier on during infall. In the second part of this letter, we
implement a self-consistent approach for which the trajectory is iteratively
corrected by the self-force, this time computed on osculating geodesics.
Finally, we compare the motion driven by the self-force without and with
self-consistent orbital evolution. Subtle differences are noticeable, even if
self-force effects have hardly the time to accumulate in such a short orbit.

find by scanning tunneling spectroscopy that hot electrons with kinetic

by a tight binding calculation taking the known reconstruction potential and

vertices has at least $$\left(\frac{(d-1)^{d-1}}{d^{d-2}}\right)^n$$ perfect
matchings. L. Gurvits gave an extension of Schrijver's theorem for matchings of
density $p$. In this paper we give a stronger version of Gurvits's theorem in
the case of vertex-transitive bipartite graphs. This stronger version in
particular implies that for every positive integer $k$, there exists a positive
constant $c(k)$ such that if a $d$-regular vertex-transitive bipartite graph on
$2n$ vertices contains a cycle of length at most $k$, then it has at least
$$\left(\frac{(d-1)^{d-1}}{d^{d-2}}+c(k)\right)^n$$ perfect matchings.
  We also show that if $(G_i)$ is a Benjamini--Schramm convergent graph
sequence of vertex-transitive bipartite graphs, then $$\frac{\ln
pm(G_i)}{v(G_i)}$$ is convergent, where $pm(G)$ and $v(G)$ denote the number of
perfect matchings and the number of vertices of $G$, respectively.
  We also show that if $G$ is $d$-regular vertex-transitive bipartite graph on
$2n$ vertices and $m_k(G)$ denote the number of matchings of size $k$, and
$$M(G,t)=1+m_1(G)t+m_2(G)t^2+\dots +m_n(G)t^n=\prod_{k=1}^n(1+\gamma_k(G)t),$$
where $\gamma_1(G)\leq \dots \leq \gamma_n(G)$, then $$\gamma_k(G)\geq
\frac{d^2}{4(d-1)}\frac{k^2}{n^2},$$ and $$\frac{m_{n-1}(G)}{m_n(G)}\leq
\frac{2}{d}n^2.$$ The latter result improves on a previous bound of C. Kenyon,
D. Randall and A. Sinclair. There are examples of $d$-regular bipartite graphs
for which these statements fail to be true without the condition of
vertex-transitivity.

  Storage",,,,,"cs.CR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  With millions of apps that can be downloaded from official or third-party
market, Android has become one of the most popular mobile platforms today.
These apps help people in all kinds of ways and thus have access to lots of
user's data that in general fall into three categories: sensitive data, data to
be shared with other apps, and non-sensitive data not to be shared with others.
For the first and second type of data, Android has provided very good storage
models: an app's private sensitive data are saved to its private folder that
can only be access by the app itself, and the data to be shared are saved to
public storage (either the external SD card or the emulated SD card area on
internal FLASH memory). But for the last type, i.e., an app's non-sensitive and
non-shared data, there is a big problem in Android's current storage model
which essentially encourages an app to save its non-sensitive data to shared
public storage that can be accessed by other apps. At first glance, it seems no
problem to do so, as those data are non-sensitive after all, but it implicitly
assumes that app developers could correctly identify all sensitive data and
prevent all possible information leakage from private-but-non-sensitive data.
In this paper, we will demonstrate that this is an invalid assumption with a
thorough survey on information leaks of those apps that had followed Android's
recommended storage model for non-sensitive data. Our studies showed that
highly sensitive information from billions of users can be easily hacked by
exploiting the mentioned problematic storage model. Although our empirical
studies are based on a limited set of apps, the identified problems are never
isolated or accidental bugs of those apps being investigated. On the contrary,
the problem is rooted from the vulnerable storage model recommended by Android.
To mitigate the threat, we also propose a defense framework.

We showed that our measure of synchronization is largely independent of the

binary star in which an A-type dwarf star (WASP 1628+10A) eclipses the remnant
of a disrupted red giant star (WASP1628+10B). We have measured the masses,
radii and luminosities of the stars in WASP 1628+10 using photometry obtained
in three bands (u', g', r') with the Ultracam instrument and medium-resolution
spectroscopy. The properties of the remnant are well-matched by models for
stars in a rarely-observed state evolving to higher effective temperatures at
nearly constant luminosity prior to becoming a very low-mass white dwarf
composed almost entirely of helium, i.e., we confirm that WASP 1628+10B is a
pre-He-WD. WASP 1628+10A appears to be a normal A2V star with a mass of $1.36
\pm 0.05 M_{\odot}$. By fitting models to the spectrum of this star around the
H$\gamma$ line we find that it has an effective temperature T$_{\rm eff,A} =
7500 \pm 200$K and a metallicity [Fe/H]$ = -0.3 \pm 0.3$. The mass of WASP
1628+10B is only $0.135 \pm 0.02M_{\odot}$. The effective temperature of this
pre-He-WD is approximately 9200K. The Ultracam photometry of WASP 1628+10 shows
variability at several frequencies around 40 cycles per day, which is typical
for $\delta$ Sct-type pulsations often observed in early A-type stars like WASP
1628+10A. We also observe frequencies near 114 cycles/day and 129 cycles/day,
much higher than the frequencies normally seen in $\delta$ Sct stars.
Additional photometry through the primary eclipse will be required to confirm
that these higher frequencies are due to pulsations in WASP 1628+10B. If
confirmed, this would be only the second known example of a pre-He-WD showing
high-frequency pulsations.

Jayram, Kumar and Sivakumar [BYJKS04]. Inspired by this connection, we
introduce the notion of Hellinger volume. We show that it lower bounds the

allows one to manipulate several Hellinger volume terms and lower bound a
Hellinger volume when the distributions involved satisfy certain conditions. In
doing so, we prove a new upper bound on the difference between the arithmetic

new tools to obtain a lower bound on the informational complexity of the AND_k

The analysis is
performed by investigating the bipartite network of banks and firms which is
obtained by setting a link between a bank and a firm when a credit relationship
is present in a given time window. In our investigation we focus on a community
detection algorithm which is identifying communities composed by both banks and
firms. We show that the clusters obtained by directly working on the bipartite
network carry information about the networked nature of the Japanese credit
market. Our analysis is performed for each calendar year during the time period
from 1980 to 2011. Specifically, we obtain communities of banks and networks
for each of the 32 investigated years, and we introduce a method to track the
time evolution of these communities on a statistical basis. We then
characterize communities by detecting the simultaneous over-expression of
attributes of firms and banks. Specifically, we consider as attributes the
economic sector and the geographical location of firms and the type of banks.
In our 32 year long analysis we detect a persistence of the over-expression of
attributes of clusters of banks and firms together with a slow dynamics of
changes from some specific attributes to new ones. Our empirical observations
show that the credit market in Japan is a networked market where the type of
banks, geographical location of firms and banks and economic sector of the firm
play a role in shaping the credit relationships between banks and firms.

with the aim to produce three-terminal spintronic devices, e.g. spin
transistors. One of the most important prerequisites for such a technology is
an effective injection of spin-polarized carriers from a ferromagnetic
semiconductor into a nonmagnetic semiconductor, preferably one of those
currently used for industrial applications such as Si - a workhorse of modern
electronics. Ferromagnetic semiconductor EuO is long believed to be the best
candidate for integration of magnetic semiconductor with Si. Although EuO
proved to offer optimal conditions for effective spin injection into silicon
and in spite of considerable efforts, the direct epitaxial stabilization of
stoichiometric EuO thin films on Si without any buffer layer has not been
demonstrated to date. Here we report a new technique for control of EuO/Si

growth of functional oxides on Si. Using this technique we solve a

developed to harvest energy from geophysical flows. The velocity of such flows
is low, and so is their energy density. Large systems are therefore required to
extract a significant amount of energy. The question of the efficiency of
energy harvesting using vortex-induced vibrations (VIV) of cables is addressed
in this paper, through two reference configurations: (i) a long tensioned cable
with periodically-distributed harvesters and (ii) a hanging cable with a single
harvester at its upper extremity. After validation against either direct
numerical simulations or experiments, an appropriate reduced-order wake-
oscillator model is used to perform parametric studies of the impact of the
harvesting parameters on the efficiency. For both configurations, an optimal
set of parameters is identified and it is shown that the maximum efficiency is
close to the value reached with an elastically-mounted rigid cylinder. The
variability of the efficiency is studied in light of the fundamental properties
of each configuration, i.e. body flexibility and gravity-induced spatial
variation of the tension. In the periodically-distributed harvester
configuration, it is found that the standing-wave nature of the vibration and
structural mode selection play a central role in energy extraction. In
contrast, the efficiency of the hanging cable is essentially driven by the
occurrence of traveling wave vibrations.

infrastructureless wireless networks. Assuming a reactive interference-limited
scenario, each transmitter is allowed to select one frequency channel (from a
common pool) together with a power level at each transmission trial; hence, for
all transmitters, not only the fading gain, but also the number of interfering
transmissions and their transmit powers are varying over time. Due to the
absence of a central controller and time-varying network characteristics, it is
highly inefficient for transmitters to acquire global channel and network
knowledge. Therefore a reasonable assumption is that transmitters have no
knowledge of fading gains, interference, and network topology. Each
transmitting node selfishly aims at maximizing its average reward (or
minimizing its average cost), which is a function of the action of that
specific transmitter as well as those of all other transmitters. This scenario
is modeled as a multi-player multi-armed adversarial bandit game, in which
multiple players receive an a priori unknown reward with an arbitrarily
time-varying distribution by sequentially pulling an arm, selected from a known
and finite set of arms. Since players do not know the arm with the highest
average reward in advance, they attempt to minimize their so-called regret,
determined by the set of players' actions, while attempting to achieve
equilibrium in some sense. To this end, we design in this paper two joint power
level and channel selection strategies. We prove that the gap between the
average reward achieved by our approaches and that based on the best fixed
strategy converges to zero asymptotically. Moreover, the empirical joint
frequencies of the game converge to the set of correlated equilibria. We
further characterize this set for two special cases of our designed game.

angular size on the sky to be resolved by the Planck satellite. Planck has
detected M31 in all of its frequency bands, and has mapped out the dust
emission with the High Frequency Instrument, clearly resolving multiple spiral
arms and sub-features. We examine the morphology of this long-wavelength dust
emission as seen by Planck, including a study of its outermost spiral arms, and
investigate the dust heating mechanism across M31. We find that dust dominating
the longer wavelength emission ($\gtrsim 0.3\,$mm) is heated by the diffuse
stellar population (as traced by 3.6$\,\mu$m emission), with the dust
dominating the shorter wavelength emission heated by a mix of the old stellar
population and star-forming regions (as traced by 24$\,\mu$m emission). We also
fit spectral energy distributions (SEDs) for individual 5' pixels and quantify
the dust properties across the galaxy, taking into account these different
heating mechanisms, finding that there is a linear decrease in temperature with
galactocentric distance for dust heated by the old stellar population, as would
be expected, with temperatures ranging from around 22$\,$K in the nucleus to
14$\,$K outside of the 10$\,$kpc ring. Finally, we measure the integrated
spectrum of the whole galaxy, which we find to be well-fitted with a global
dust temperature of ($18.2\pm1.0$)$\,$K with a spectral index of $1.62\pm0.11$
(assuming a single modified blackbody), and a significant amount of free-free
emission at intermediate frequencies of 20-60$\,$GHz, which corresponds to a
star formation rate of around $0.12$M$_\odot\,$yr$^{-1}$. We find a
$2.3\,\sigma$ detection of the presence of spinning dust emission, with a
30$\,$GHz amplitude of $0.7\pm0.3\,$Jy, which is in line with expectations from
our Galaxy.

observations of the $Q/I$ profiles of the Ca I 4227 A line recorded with the
ZIMPOL-3 at IRSOL. For modeling, we use the polarized radiative transfer with
partial frequency redistribution with a number of realistic 1-D model
atmospheres. We find that all the standard FAL model atmospheres, used by us,
fail to simultaneously fit the observed ($I$, $Q/I$) at all the limb distances
($\mu$). However, an attempt is made to find a single model which can provide a
fit at least to the CLV of the observed $Q/I$ instead of a simultaneous fit to
the ($I$, $Q/I$) at all $\mu$. To this end we construct a new 1-D model by
combining two of the standard models after modifying their temperature
structures in the appropriate height ranges. This new combined model closely
reproduces the observed $Q/I$ at all the $\mu$, but fails to reproduce the
observed rest intensity at different $\mu$. Hence we find that no single 1-D
model atmosphere succeeds in providing a good representation of the real Sun.
This failure of 1-D models does not however cause an impediment to the magnetic
field diagnostic potential of the Ca I 4227 A line. To demonstrate this we
deduce the field strength at various $\mu$ positions without invoking the use

retrieving sparse signals in a number of recent works, in the context of blind
deconvolution. Indeed, it benefits from a scale invariance property much
desirable in the blind context. However, the l1/l2 function raises some
difficulties when solving the nonconvex and nonsmooth minimization problems
resulting from the use of such a penalty term in current restoration methods.
In this paper, we propose a new penalty based on a smooth approximation to the
l1/l2 function. In addition, we develop a proximal-based algorithm to solve
variational problems involving this function and we derive theoretical
convergence results. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through a
comparison with a recent alternating optimization strategy dealing with the
exact l1/l2 term, on an application to seismic data blind deconvolution.

to relatively small sample sizes and the presence of complex interaction

nonparametric framework for simultaneous variable selection, clustering and
prediction in high-throughput regression settings with continuous or discrete
outcomes, called VariScan. The VariScan model utilizes the sparsity induced by
Poisson-Dirichlet processes (PDPs) to group the covariates into
lower-dimensional latent clusters consisting of covariates with similar
patterns among the samples. The data are permitted to direct the choice of a
suitable cluster allocation scheme, choosing between PDPs and their special
case, a Dirichlet process. Subsequently, the latent clusters are used to build
a nonlinear prediction model for the responses using an adaptive mixture of
linear and nonlinear elements, thus achieving a balance between model parsimony
and flexibility. We investigate theoretical properties of the VariScan
procedure that differentiate the allocations patterns of PDPs and Dirichlet
processes both in terms of the number and relative sizes of their clusters.
Additional theoretical results guarantee the high accuracy of the model-based
clustering procedure, and establish model selection and prediction consistency.
Through simulation studies and analyses of benchmark data sets, we demonstrate
the reliability of VariScan's clustering mechanism and show that the technique
compares favorably to, and often outperforms, existing methodologies in terms
of the prediction accuracies of the subject-specific responses.

tool for the analysis of flow systems, and its application to entropy balance
calculations. Firstly, the principles of control volume analysis are enunciated
and applied to flows of conserved quantities (e.g. mass, momentum, energy)
through a control volume, giving integral (Reynolds transport theorem) and
differential forms of the conservation equations. Several definitions of steady
state are discussed. The concept of ""entropy"" is then established using Jaynes'
maximum entropy method, both in general and in equilibrium thermodynamics. The
thermodynamic entropy then gives the ""entropy production"" concept. Equations
for the entropy production are then derived for simple, integral and
infinitesimal flow systems. Some technical aspects are examined, including
discrete and continuum representations of volume elements, the effect of
radiation, and the analysis of systems subdivided into compartments. A Reynolds
decomposition of the entropy production equation then reveals an ""entropy
production closure problem"" in fluctuating dissipative systems: even at steady
state, the entropy production based on mean flow rates and gradients is not
necessarily in balance with the outward entropy fluxes based on mean
quantities. Finally, a direct analysis of an infinitesimal element by Jaynes'
maximum entropy method yields a theoretical framework with which to predict the
steady state of a flow system. This is cast in terms of a ""minimum flux
potential"" principle, which reduces, in different circumstances, to maximum or
minimum entropy production (MaxEP or MinEP) principles. It is hoped that this
chapter inspires others to attain a deeper understanding and higher technical
rigour in the calculation and extremisation of the entropy production in flow
systems of all types.

instabilities due to external stochastic excitation. These intermittent
instabilities, though rare, have a large impact on the probabilistic response
of the system and give rise to heavy-tailed probability distributions. By
making appropriate assumptions on the form of these instabilities, which are
valid for a broad range of systems, we formulate a method for the analytical
approximation of the probability distribution function (pdf) of the system
response (both the main probability mass and the heavy-tail structure). In
particular, this method relies on conditioning the probability density of the
response on the occurrence of an instability and the separate analysis of the
two states of the system, the unstable and stable state. In the stable regime
we employ steady state assumptions, which lead to the derivation of the
conditional response pdf using standard methods for random dynamical systems.
The unstable regime is inherently transient and in order to analyze this regime
we characterize the statistics under the assumption of an exponential growth
phase and a subsequent decay phase until the system is brought back to the
stable attractor. The method we present allows us to capture the statistics
associated with the dynamics that give rise to heavy-tails in the system
response and the analytical approximations compare favorably with direct Monte
Carlo simulations, which we illustrate for two prototype intermittent systems:
an intermittently unstable mechanical oscillator excited by correlated
multiplicative noise and a complex mode in a turbulent signal with fixed
frequency, where multiplicative stochastic damping and additive noise model
interactions between various modes.

mixed-state fidelity susceptibility (MFS) for thermal states. The mathematical
techniques used provides an analytical expression for the MFS as a formal
expansion in terms of the thermodynamic mean values of successively higher
commutators of the Hamiltonian with the operator involved through the control
parameter. That expression is naturally divided into two parts: the usual
isothermal susceptibility and a constituent in the form of an infinite series
of thermodynamic mean values which encodes the noncommutativity in the problem.
If the symmetry properties of the Hamiltonian are given in terms of the
generators of some (finite dimensional) algebra, the obtained expansion may be
evaluated in a closed form. This issue is tested on several popular models, for
which it is shown that the calculations are much simpler if they are based on
the properties from the representation theory of the Heisenberg or SU(1, 1) Lie
algebra.

beams provides an unbounded \qo{space} for both classical and quantum
communications. Among the different approaches to generate and manipulate
orbital angular momentum states of light, coupling between spin and orbital
angular momentum allows a faster manipulation of orbital angular momentum
states because it depends on manipulating the polarisation state of light,
which is simpler and generally faster than manipulating conventional orbital
angular momentum generators. In this work, we design and fabricate an
ultra-thin spin-to-orbital angular momentum converter, based on plasmonic
nano-antennas and operating in the visible wavelength range that is capable of
converting spin to an arbitrary value of OAM $\ell$. The nano-antennas are
arranged in an array with a well-defined geometry in the transverse plane of
the beam, possessing a specific integer or half-integer topological charge $q$.
When a circularly polarised light beam traverses this metasurface, the output
beam polarisation switches handedness and the OAM changes in value by $\ell =
\pm2q\hbar$ per photon. We experimentally demonstrate $\ell$ values ranging
from $\pm 1$ to $\pm 25$ with conversion efficiencies of $8.6\pm0.4~\%$. Our
ultra-thin devices are integratable and thus suitable for applications in
quantum communications, quantum computations and nano-scale sensing.

natural playground for the $\gamma$-ray excess from the galactic center (GC).
In this paper, we first discuss in detail the GC $\gamma$-ray excess in scalar
dark matter model with local $Z_{3}$ symmetry which was recently proposed by
the present authors. Within this model, scalar DM with mass $30-70$GeV is
allowed due to newly-opened (semi-)annihilation channels of DM pair into dark
Higgs $\phi$ and/or dark photon $Z^{'}$ pair, and can fit the $\gamma$-ray
spectrum from the GC. Then we argue that the GC gamma ray excess can be easily
accommodated in hidden sector dark matter models where DM is stabilized by
local gauge symmetries, due to the presence of dark Higgs (and also dark photon
for Abelian dark gauge symmetry). As by-products, the Higgs portal interaction
between the dark Higgs and the SM Higgs boson can improve the EW vacuum
stability up to Planck scale, and enable the Higgs inflation scenario to have
potentially large tensor-to-scalar ratio, $r\sim O(0.01 - 0.1)$.

  works. To appear in Memoirs AMS",,,,"math.DG gr-qc","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The notion of wind Finslerian structure is developed; this is a
generalization of Finsler metrics where the indicatrices at the tangent spaces
may not contain the zero vector. In the particular case that these indicatrices
are ellipsoids, called here wind Riemannian structures, they admit a double
interpretation which provides: (a) a model for classical Zermelo's navigation
problem even when the trajectories of the moving objects (planes, ships) are
influenced by strong winds or streams, and (b) a natural description of the
causal structure of relativistic spacetimes endowed with a non-vanishing
Killing vector field (SSTK splittings), in terms of Finslerian elements. These
elements can be regarded as conformally invariant Killing initial data on a
partial Cauchy hypersurface. The wind Finslerian structure is described in
terms of two (conic, pseudo) Finsler metrics, one with a convex indicatrix and
the other with a concave one. However, the spacetime viewpoint for the wind
Riemannian case gives a useful unified viewpoint. A thorough study of the
causal properties of such a spacetime is carried out in Finslerian terms.
Randers-Kropina metrics appear as the Finslerian counterpart to the case of an
SSTK when the Killing vector field is either timelike or lightlike. Among the
applications, we obtain the solution of Zermelo's navigation with arbitrary
stationary wind, metric-type properties (distance-type arrival function,
completeness, existence of minimizing, maximizing or closed geodesics), as well
as description of spacetime elements (Cauchy developments, black hole horizons)
in terms of Finslerian elements in Killing initial data. A general Fermat's
principle of independent interest for arbitrary spacetimes, as well as its
applications to SSTK spacetimes and Zermelo's navigation, are also provided.

for systems far away from equilibrium. With this formalism, we formulate novel
thermodynamics theories for heat conduction in rigid bodies and non-isothermal
compressible Maxwell fluid flows as two typical examples. In these examples,
the non-equilibrium variables are exactly the conjugate variables of the heat

can be calibrated traceably with a cryogenic current comparator (CCC) system.
We compare the results from both independent calibration routes for two
different ULCA prototypes. We find agreement between both methods at an
uncertainty level below 10 microA/A, limited by the uncertainty of the currents

However, when the treatment effect is assessed by other summaries, e.g. by an
odds ratio if the outcome is binary, then bias can arise if some covariates are
omitted, regardless of the use of randomization for treatment allocation or the

future actions. In this model, eight strategies (referred to as 'leading

therefore resistant to invasions by other strategies. Here we show that, by
assigning each individual one out of two labels that peers can distinguish

rules to depend on the label, intolerant behaviours can emerge within
minorities under sufficient economic stress. We analyse the sets of conditions

experiments to investigate the dynamics of water at interfaces of molecular
roughness and low mobility. We find that, when approaching such interfaces, the
structural relaxation of water, i.e., the $\alpha$ process, slows down even
when specific attractive interactions are absent. This prominent effect is
accompanied by a smooth transition from Vogel to Arrhenius temperature
dependence and by a growing importance of jump events. Consistently, at protein
surfaces, deviations from Arrhenius behavior are weak when free water does not
exist. Furthermore, in nanoporous silica, a dynamic crossover of liquid water
occurs when a fraction of solid water forms near 225 K and, hence, the liquid
dynamics changes from bulk-like to interface-dominated. At sufficiently low
temperatures, water exhibits a quasi-universal $\beta$ process, which is
characterized by an activation energy of $E_a\!=\!0.5$ eV and involves
anisotropic reorientation about large angles. As a consequence of its large
amplitude, the faster $\beta$ process destroys essentially all orientational
correlation, rendering observation of a possible slower $\alpha$ process
difficult in standard experiments. Nevertheless, we find indications for the
existence of structural relaxation down to a glass transition of interfacial
water near 185 K. Hydrated proteins show a highly restricted backbone motion
with an amplitude, which decreases upon cooling and vanishes at comparable
temperatures, providing evidence for a high relevance of water rearrangements
in the hydration shell for secondary protein relaxations.

widespread adoption of parallel programming. We implemented a prototype system

tasks of interest in the analysis of such data is the testing of hypotheses, in
answer to questions such as ""Is there a difference between the networks of

of familiar two-sample testing strategies. Networks, however, are not Euclidean

high-dimensional statistical inference. Our work is based on a precise
geometric characterization of the space of graph Laplacian matrices and a
nonparametric notion of averaging due to Fr\'echet. We motivate and illustrate
our resulting methodologies for testing in the context of networks derived from

multi-dimensional time series of option prices corresponding to $n$ strikes
(with $n$ large, e.g. $n\geq 40$) and the same maturity, is a difficult task
due to the fact that option prices at any moment in time satisfy non-linear and
non-explicit no-arbitrage restrictions. Hence any $n$-dimensional time series
model also has to satisfy these implicit restrictions at each time step, a
condition that is impossible to meet since the model innovations can take
arbitrary values. We solve this problem for any $n\in\NN$ in the context of
Foreign Exchange (FX) by first encoding the option prices at each time step in
terms of the parameters of the corresponding risk-neutral measure and then
performing the time series analysis in the parameter space. The option price
predictions are obtained from the predicted risk-neutral measure by effectively
integrating it against the corresponding option payoffs. The non-linear
transformation between option prices and the risk-neutral parameters applied
here is \textit{not} arbitrary: it is the standard mapping used by market
makers in the FX option markets (the SABR parameterisation) and is given
explicitly in closed form. Our method is not restricted to the FX asset class
nor does it depend on the type of parameterisation used. Statistical analysis
of FX market data illustrates that our arbitrage-free predictions outperform

particles produced in pp collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 0.9, 2.76 and 7 TeV, and
Pb-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 2.76 TeV are studied as a function of the
charged-particle multiplicity using the ALICE detector at the LHC. Dynamical
fluctuations indicative of correlated particle emission are observed in all
systems. The results in pp collisions show little dependence on collision
energy. The Monte Carlo event generators PYTHIA and PHOJET are in qualitative
agreement with the data. Peripheral Pb-Pb data exhibit a similar multiplicity
dependence as that observed in pp. In central Pb-Pb, the results deviate from
this trend, featuring a significant reduction of the fluctuation strength. The
results in Pb--Pb are in qualitative agreement with previous measurements in
Au-Au at lower collision energies and with expectations from models that
incorporate collective phenomena.

created by low energy ion implantation of arsenic in silicon are detected by
two methods, spin-dependent recombination (SDR) using microwave
photoconductivity and electrically detected magnetic resonance (EDMR)
monitoring the DC current through the sample. The high sensitivity of these
techniques allows the observation of the magnetic resonance in particular of As
in weak magnetic fields and at low resonance frequencies (40-1200 MHz), where
high-field-forbidden transitions between the magnetic substates can be observed
due to the mixing of electron and nuclear spin states. Several
implantation-induced defects are present in the samples studied and act as spin
readout partner. We explicitly demonstrate this by electrically detected
electron double resonance experiments and identify a pair recombination of
close pairs formed by As donors and oxygen-vacancy centers in an excited

  Networks",,,,,"cs.IT cs.NI math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Millimeter wave (mmW) cellular systems will require high gain directional
antennas and dense base station (BS) deployments to overcome high near field
path loss and poor diffraction. As a desirable side effect, high gain antennas
provide interference isolation, providing an opportunity to incorporate
self-backhauling--BSs backhauling among themselves in a mesh architecture
without significant loss in throughput--to enable the requisite large BS
densities. The use of directional antennas and resource sharing between access
and backhaul links leads to coverage and rate trends that differ significantly
from conventional microwave ($\mu$W) cellular systems. In this paper, we
propose a general and tractable mmW cellular model capturing these key trends
and characterize the associated rate distribution. The developed model and
analysis is validated using actual building locations from dense urban settings
and empirically-derived path loss models. The analysis shows that in sharp
contrast to the interference limited nature of $\mu$W cellular networks, the
spectral efficiency of mmW networks (besides total rate) also increases with BS
density particularly at the cell edge. Increasing the system bandwidth,
although boosting median and peak rates, does not significantly influence the
cell edge rate. With self-backhauling, different combinations of the wired
backhaul fraction (i.e. the faction of BSs with a wired connection) and BS
density are shown to guarantee the same median rate (QoS).

is a diagonal of a rational function of three variables. Its exterior square
has a rational solution, indicating that it has a selected differential Galois
group, and is actually homomorphic to its adjoint. We obtain the two
corresponding intertwiners giving this homomorphism to the adjoint. We show
that these intertwiners are also homomorphic to their adjoint and have a simple
decomposition, already underlined in a previous paper, in terms of order-two
self-adjoint operators. From these results, we deduce a new form of
decomposition of operators for this selected order-six linear differential
operator in terms of three order-two self-adjoint operators. We then generalize
the previous decomposition to decompositions in terms of an arbitrary number of
self-adjoint operators of the same parity order. This yields an infinite family
of linear differential operators homomorphic to their adjoint, and, thus, with
a selected differential Galois group. We show that the equivalence of such
operators is compatible with these canonical decompositions. The rational
solutions of the symmetric, or exterior, squares of these selected operators
are, noticeably, seen to depend only on the rightmost self-adjoint operator in
the decomposition. These results, and tools, are applied on operators of large
orders. For instance, it is seen that a large set of (quite massive) operators,
associated with reflexive 4-polytopes defining Calabi-Yau 3-folds, obtained
recently by P. Lairez, correspond to a particular form of the decomposition
detailed in this paper.

from complex Fabry-P\'erot interference (at zero magnetic field) to the quantum
Hall effect (at unusually low field) are observed and are well reproduced by

symmetries, suffices to derive Lorentz-like coordinate transformations between
inertial frames. These contain a free parameter, $k$, (equal to $c^{-2}$ in
special relativity) which is usually claimed to be empirically determinable, so
that special relativity does not need the postulate of constancy of the speed
of light. I analyze this claim and find that all methods destined to measure
$k$ fail without further assumptions, similar to the second postulate.
Specifically, measuring $k$ requires a signal that travels identically in
opposite directions (this is unrelated to the conventionality of
synchronization, as the one-postulate program implicitly selects the standard
synchronization convention). Positing such a property about light is logically
weaker than Einstein's second postulate but suffices to recover special
relativity in full.
