Companion paper to arXiv:1401.6065",,,,"math.PR math-ph math.MP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  On any locally-finite geometry, the stochastic Ising model is known to be
contractive when the inverse-temperature $\beta$ is small enough, via classical
results of Dobrushin and of Holley in the 1970's. By a general principle
proposed by Peres, the dynamics is then expected to exhibit cutoff. However, so
far cutoff for the Ising model has been confirmed mainly for lattices, heavily
relying on amenability and log Sobolev inequalities. Without these, cutoff was
unknown at any fixed $\beta>0$, no matter how small, even in basic examples
such as the Ising model on a binary tree or a random regular graph.
  We use the new framework of information percolation to show that, in any
geometry, there is cutoff for the Ising model at high enough temperatures.
Precisely, on any sequence of graphs with maximum degree $d$, the Ising model
has cutoff provided that $\beta<\kappa/d$ for some absolute constant $\kappa$
(a result which, up to the value of $\kappa$, is best possible). Moreover, the
cutoff location is established as the time at which the sum of squared
magnetizations drops to 1, and the cutoff window is $O(1)$, just as when
$\beta=0$.
  Finally, the mixing time from almost every initial state is not more than a
factor of $1+\epsilon_\beta$ faster then the worst one (with
$\epsilon_\beta\to0$ as $\beta\to 0$), whereas the uniform starting state is at
least $2-\epsilon_\beta$ times faster.

mass, $M_{WL}$, and near-infrared luminosity, $L_K$. Our results are based on
17 clusters observed with wide-field instruments on Subaru, the United Kingdom
Infrared Telescope, the Mayall Telescope, and the MMT. We concentrate on the
relation between projected 2D weak-lensing mass and spectroscopically confirmed
luminosity within 1Mpc, modelled as $M_{WL} \propto L_{K}^b$, obtaining a power
law slope of $b=0.83^{+0.27}_{-0.24}$ and an intrinsic scatter of
$\sigma_{lnM_{WL}|L_{K}}=10^{+8}_{-5}\%$. Intrinsic scatter of ~10% is a
consistent feature of our results regardless of how we modify our approach to
measuring the relationship between mass and light. For example, deprojecting
the mass and measuring both quantities within $r_{500}$, that is itself
obtained from the lensing analysis, yields
$\sigma_{lnM_{WL}|L_{K}}=10^{+7}_{-5}\%$ and $b=0.97^{+0.17}_{-0.17}$. We also
find that selecting members based on their (J-K) colours instead of
spectroscopic redshifts neither increases the scatter nor modifies the slope.
Overall our results indicate that near-infrared luminosity measured on scales
comparable with $r_{500}$ (typically 1Mpc for our sample) is a low scatter and
relatively inexpensive proxy for weak-lensing mass. Near-infrared luminosity
may therefore be a useful mass proxy for cluster cosmology experiments.

Soil-Vegetation-Atmosphere-System is required to investigate component

atmosphere, land-surface and subsurface are usually operated at different
resolutions in space and time owing to the dominant processes. The
computationally often more expensive atmospheric models, for instance, are
typically employed at a coarser resolution than land-surface and subsurface
models. Thus up- and downscaling procedures are required at the interface
between the atmospheric model and the land-surface/subsurface models. We apply
multi-objective Genetic Programming (GP) to a training data set of
high-resolution atmospheric model runs to learn equations or short programs
that reconstruct the fine-scale fields (e.g., 400 m resolution) of the
near-surface atmospheric state variables from the coarse atmospheric model
output (e.g., 2.8 km resolution). Like artificial neural networks, GP can
flexibly incorporate multivariate and nonlinear relations, but offers the
advantage that the solutions are human readable and thus can be checked for
physical consistency. Using the Strength Pareto Approach for multi-objective
fitness assignment allows us to consider multiple characteristics of the
fine-scale fields during the learning procedure.

although the flow is not classically differentiable, nevertheless it admits a
first-order approximation (known as a Bouligand derivative) that is
piecewise-linear and continuous at every point. We exploit this first-order

analysis, radial velocity and eclipse timing variation studies, separation of
pulsational features of the light curve, and binary light curve analysis led to
the accurate determination of the fundamental stellar parameters. We found that
the binary is composed of two main sequence stars with an age of 0.9\+-0.2 Gyr,
having masses, radii and temperatures of M_1=1.93+-0.12 M_sun, R_1=3.30+-0.07

the binary model, we found three independent frequencies, two of which are
separated by twice the orbital frequency. We also found an enigmatic half
orbital period sinusoidal variation that we attribute to an anomalous
ellipsoidal effect. Both of these observations indicate that tidal effects are
strongly influencing the luminosity variations of HD 183648. The analysis of
the eclipse timing variations revealed both a parabolic trend, and apsidal
motion with a period of (P_apse)_obs=10,400+-3,000 y, which is three times

during some period of its history, possibly as recently as 0.5-1 billion years
ago. It could also happen in the future. Under these conditions, the atmosphere
becomes only composed of nitrogen with a range of temperature and pressure
allowing liquid or solid nitrogen to condense. Here, we explore these exotic
climates throughout Titan's history with a 3D Global Climate Model (GCM)
including the nitrogen cycle and the radiative effect of nitrogen clouds. We
show that for the last billion years, only small polar nitrogen lakes should
have formed. Yet, before 1 Ga, a significant part of the atmosphere could have
condensed, forming deep nitrogen polar seas, which could have flowed and
flooded the equatorial regions. Alternatively, nitrogen could be frozen on the
surface like on Triton, but this would require an initial surface albedo higher
than 0.65 at 4 Ga. Such a state could be stable even today if nitrogen ice
albedo is higher than this value. According to our model, nitrogen flows and
rain may have been efficient to erode the surface. Thus, we can speculate that
a paleo-nitrogen cycle may explain the erosion and the age of Titan's surface,
and may have produced some of the present valley networks and shorelines.
Moreover, by diffusion of liquid nitrogen in the crust, a paleo-nitrogen cycle
could be responsible of the flattening of the polar regions and be at the
origin of the methane outgassing on Titan.

sequence data has become central to the understanding of infectious disease
dynamics. Various models have been proposed to infer details of the dynamics
that describe epidemic progression. These include inference approaches derived
from Kingman's coalescent theory. Here, we use recently described coalescent
theory for epidemic dynamics to develop stochastic and deterministic coalescent
SIR tree priors. We implement these in a Bayesian phylogenetic inference
framework to permit joint estimation of SIR epidemic parameters and the sample
genealogy. We assess the performance of the two coalescent models and also
juxtapose results obtained with BDSIR, a recently published
birth-death-sampling model for epidemic inference. Comparisons are made by
analyzing sets of genealogies simulated under precisely known epidemiological
parameters. Additionally, we analyze influenza A (H1N1) sequence data sampled
in the Canterbury region of New Zealand and HIV-1 sequence data obtained from
known UK infection clusters. We show that both coalescent SIR models are
effective at estimating epidemiological parameters from data with large
fundamental reproductive number $R_0$ and large population size $S_0$.
Furthermore, we find that the stochastic variant generally outperforms its
deterministic counterpart in terms of error, bias, and highest posterior
density coverage, particularly for smaller $R_0$ and $S_0$. However, each of
these inference models are shown to have undesirable properties in certain
circumstances, especially for epidemic outbreaks with $R_0$ close to one or
with small effective susceptible populations.

under force free native conditions, but are encoded in the spectrum of native
fluctuations. The folding phase diagrams of SH3 as a function of denaturant
concentration ($[C]$), mechanical force ($f$), and temperature exhibit an
apparent two-state behavior, without revealing the presence of the elusive
$N^*$ states. Interestingly, the phase boundaries separating the folded and
unfolded states at all [C] and $f$ fall on a master curve, which can can be
quantitatively described using an analogy to superconductors in a magnetic
field. The free energy profiles as a function of the molecular extension ($R$),
which are accessible in pulling experiments, ($R$), reveal the presence of a
native-like $N^*$ with a disordered solvent-exposed amino terminal
$\beta$-strand. The structure of the $N^*$ state is identical to that found in
Fyn SH3 by NMR dispersion experiments. We show that the time scale for fibril
formation can be estimated from the population of the $N^*$ state, determined
by the free energy gap separating the native structure and the $N^*$ state, a
finding that can be used to assess fibril forming tendencies of proteins. The
structures of the $N^*$ state are used to show that oligomer formation and
likely route to fibrils occur by a domain-swap mechanism in SH3 domain.

deviation in the Higgs decay to $Z\gamma$ with respect to the Standard Model
prediction and the largest enhancement is found for a ratio $R_{Z\gamma}$ of
the order $1.6$. Furthermore we show that consistency with current ATLAS data
on the diphoton decay channel favours a light doubly charged Higgs with mass in
the range $92 - 180$~GeV. Finally, we find that the $\gamma\gamma$ and $Z
\gamma$ Higgs decay modes are generally correlated and the magnitude of
correlation is sensitive to the sign of the $\lambda_{1}$ parameter.

flux-selected (S > 50 mJy) sample of 93 radio AGN with available SDSS redshifts
between 0.02 < z < 0.23. We study the gas properties of radio AGN down to
fluxes not systematically explored before using, for the first time, stacking
of extragalactic HI absorption. Despite the shallow observations, we obtained a
direct detection rate of ~29%, comparable with deeper studies. Detections are
found at every flux level, showing that HI absorption detections are not biased
toward brighter sources. The stacks of detections and non-detections reveal a
clear dichotomy in the presence of HI, with the 27 detections showing an
average peak {\tau} = 0.02, while the 66 non-detections remain undetected with
an upper limit {\tau} < 0.002. Separating the sample into compact and extended
AGN increases the detection rate, {\tau}, and FWHM for the compact sample. The
dichotomy for the stacked profiles of detections and non-detections still holds
between these two groups. We argue that orientation effects connected to a
disk-like distribution of HI can be partly responsible for the dichotomy,
however some of our galaxies must be genuinely depleted of cold gas. A fraction
of the compact sources are confirmed by previous studies as likely young radio
sources. These show an even higher detection rate of 55%. Along with their high
integrated optical depth and wider profile, this reinforces the idea that young
radio AGN are particularly rich in atomic gas. Part of our motivation is to
probe for the presence of HI outflows. However, the stacked profiles do not
reveal any significant blueshifted wing. Our results are particularly relevant
for future surveys. The lack of bias toward bright sources is encouraging for
the search of HI at lower radio fluxes. The results also represent a reference
point for search for HI absorption at higher redshifts.

electromagnetic problem also be a solution. This paper analyzes some very
simple problems: the constructive and destructive interferences of short
impulse voltage and current waves along an ideal free-space transmission line.
When voltage waves constructively interfere, the superposition has twice the
electrical energy of the individual waveforms because current goes to zero,
converting magnetic to electrical energy. When voltage waves destructively
interfere, the superposition has no electrical energy because it transforms to
magnetic energy. Although the impedance of the individual waves is that of free
space, a superposition of waves may exhibit arbitrary impedance. Further,
interferences of identical waveforms allow no energy transfer between opposite
ends of a transmission line. The waves appear to recoil elastically one from
another. Although alternate interpretations are possible, these appear less
likely. Similar phenomenology arises in waves of arbitrary shape and those
propagating in free space as well. We may also interpret this behavior as each
wave reflecting from the impedance variations the superposition imparts on free
space. This work has practical implications to quantum mechanics, field
diversity antenna systems, and near-field electromagnetic ranging.

system and the heat bath plays an important role in the system dynamics. This
is particularly true in the case of non-Markovian noise. We rigorously
investigate the influence of system-bath coherence by deriving the reduced
hierarchal equations of motion (HEOM), not only in real time, but also in
imaginary time, which represents an inverse temperature. It is shown that the
HEOM in real time obtained when we include the system-bath coherence of the
initial thermal equilibrium state possess the same form as those obtained from
a factorized initial state. We find that the difference in behavior of systems
treated in these two manners results from the difference in initial conditions
of the HEOM elements, which are defined in path integral form. We also derive
HEOM along the imaginary time path to obtain the thermal equilibrium state of a
system strongly coupled to a non-Markovian bath. Then, we show that the steady
state hierarchy elements calculated from the real-time HEOM can be expressed in
terms of the hierarchy elements calculated from the imaginary-time HEOM.
Moreover, we find that the imaginary-time HEOM allow us to evaluate a number of
thermodynamic variables, including the free energy, entropy, internal energy,
heat capacity, and susceptibility. The expectation values of the system energy
and system-bath interaction energy in the thermal equilibrium state are also
evaluated.

significantly with recent results from the Herschel Space Observatory. To set
even better constraints, we report here on deep searches for the NH+ ground
state rotational transition J=1.5-0.5 of the ^2Pi_1/2 lower spin ladder, with
fine-structure transitions at 1013 and 1019 GHz, and the para-NH2- 1_1,1-0_0,0
rotational transition at 934 GHz towards Sgr B2(M) and G10.6-0.4 using
Herschel-HIFI. No clear detections of NH+ are made and the derived upper limits
are <2*10^-12 and <7*10^-13 in Sgr B2(M) and G10.6-0.4, respectively. The
searches are complicated by the fact that the 1013 GHz transition lies only
-2.5 km/s from a CH2NH line, seen in absorption in Sgr B2(M), and that the
hyperfine structure components in the 1019 GHz transition are spread over 134
km/s. Searches for the so far undetected NH2- anion turned out to be unfruitful
towards G10.6-0.4, while the para-NH2- 1_1,1-0_0,0 transition was tentatively
detected towards Sgr B2(M) at a velocity of 19 km/s. Assuming that the
absorption occurs at the nominal source velocity of +64 km/s, the rest
frequency would be 933.996 GHz, offset by 141 MHz from our estimated value.
Using this feature as an upper limit, we found N(p-NH2-)<4*10^11 cm^-2. The
upper limits for both species in the diffuse line-of-sight gas are less than
0.1 to 2 % of the values found for NH, NH2, and NH3 towards both sources.
Chemical modelling predicts an NH+ abundance a few times lower than our present
upper limits in diffuse gas and under typical Sgr B2(M) envelope conditions.
The NH2- abundance is predicted to be several orders of magnitudes lower than
our observed limits, hence not supporting our tentative detection. Thus, while
NH2- may be very difficult to detect in interstellar space, it could, be
possible to detect NH+ in regions where the ionisation rates of H2 and N are
greatly enhanced.

rapidly decreasing functions of $p_T$. We show this with both an analytic

suggesting a physical connection between high stellar density and efficient,
rapid cessation of star-formation. We present restframe UV spectra of
Lyman-break galaxies (LBGs) at z~3 selected to be candidate progenitors of
quenched galaxies at z~2 based on their compact restframe optical sizes and
high surface density of star-formation. We compare their UV properties to those
of more extended LBGs of similar mass and star formation rate (non-candidates).
We find that candidate progenitors have faster ISM gas velocities and higher
equivalent widths of interstellar absorption lines, implying larger velocity
spread among absorbing clouds. Candidates deviate from the relationship between
equivalent widths of Lyman-alpha and interstellar absorption lines in that
their Lyman-alpha emission remains strong despite high interstellar absorption,
possibly indicating that the neutral HI fraction is patchy such that
Lyman-alpha photons can escape. We detect stronger CIV P-Cygni features
(emission and absorption) and HeII emission in candidates, indicative of larger
populations of metal rich Wolf-Rayet stars compared to non-candidates. The
faster bulk motions, broader spread of gas velocity, and Lyman-alpha properties
of candidates are consistent with their ISM being subject to more energetic
feedback than non-candidates. Together with their larger metallicity (implying
more evolved star-formation activity) this leads us to propose, if
speculatively, that they are likely to quench sooner than non-candidates,
supporting the validity of selection criteria used to identify them as
progenitors of z~2 passive galaxies. We propose that massive, compact galaxies
undergo more rapid growth of stellar mass content, perhaps because the gas
accretion mechanisms are different, and quench sooner than normally-sized LBGs
at these early epochs.

be discovered low-luminosity dSph galaxies, we perform a {\em guided} search
for these low-luminosity dSph galaxies. In order to detect the presence of dSph
galaxies, we combine stars selected from more than 123 sightlines centered on
RR Lyrae stars identified by the Palomar Transient Factory. We find that this

particles with $\sim5%$ accuracy for $k_i\lesssim0.10\,h/{\rm Mpc}$ at $z=0$,
for $k_i\lesssim0.15\,h/{\rm Mpc}$ at $z=0.5$, for $k_i\lesssim0.17\,h/{\rm

test that the fitting formula is able to describe with similar accuracy the
bispectrum of cosmologies with different $\Omega_m$, in the range $0.2\lesssim
\Omega_m \lesssim 0.4$, and consequently with different values of the
logarithmic grow rate $f$ at $z=0$, $0.4\lesssim f(z=0) \lesssim 0.6$. We apply
this new formula to recover the bias parameters, $f$ and $\sigma_8$, by
combining the redshift space power spectrum monopole and quadrupole with the
bispectrum monopole for both dark matter particles and haloes. We find that the
combination of these three statistics can break the degeneracy between $b_1$,
$f$ and $\sigma_8$. For dark matter particles the new model can be used to
recover $f$ and $\sigma_8$ with $\sim1%$ accuracy. For dark matter haloes we
find that $f$ and $\sigma_8$ present larger systematic shifts, $\sim10%$. The
systematic offsets arise because of limitations in the modelling of the
interplay between bias and redshift space distortions, and represent a
limitation as the statistical errors of forthcoming surveys reach this level.
Conveniently, we find that these residual systematics are mitigated for
combinations of parameters. The improvement on the modelling of the bispectrum
presented in this paper will be useful for extracting information from current
and future galaxy surveys. [abridged]

their mass-loss properties. Their initial and final masses differ significantly
as a result of mass loss. VMS have strong stellar winds and extremely high
ionising fluxes, which are thought to be critical sources of both mechanical
and radiative feedback in giant Hii regions. However, how VMS mass-loss
properties change during stellar evolution is poorly understood. In the
framework of the VLT-Flames Tarantula Survey (VFTS), we explore the mass-loss
transition region from optically thin O to denser WNh star winds, thereby
testing theoretical predictions. To this purpose we select 62 O, Of, Of/WN, and
WNh stars, an unprecedented sample of stars with the highest masses and
luminosities known. We perform a spectral analysis of optical VFTS as well as
near-infrared VLT/SINFONI data using the non-LTE radiative transfer code CMFGEN
to obtain stellar and wind parameters. For the first time, we observationally
resolve the transition between optically thin O and optically thick WNh star
winds. Our results suggest the existence of a kink between both mass-loss
regimes, in agreement with recent MC simulations. For the optically thick
regime, we confirm the steep dependence on the Eddington factor from previous
theoretical and observational studies. The transition occurs on the MS near a
luminosity of 10^6.1Lsun, or a mass of 80...90Msun. Above this limit, we find
that - even when accounting for moderate wind clumping (with f = 0.1) - wind
mass-loss rates are enhanced with respect to standard prescriptions currently
adopted in stellar evolution calculations. We also show that this results in
substantial helium surface enrichment. Based on our spectroscopic analyses, we
are able to provide the most accurate ionising fluxes for VMS known to date,
confirming the pivotal role of VMS in ionising and shaping their environments.

offset by $\sim$0.3 dex from the observed star-forming sequence, consistent
with the mild disagreement between the cosmic SFR and recent observations of
the growth of the stellar mass density. It is unclear whether this problem
stems from errors in stellar mass estimates, errors in SFRs, or other effects.
We show that a mass-dependent slope is also seen in other self-consistent
models of galaxy evolution, including semi-analytical, hydrodynamical, and
abundance-matching models. As part of the analysis, we demonstrate that neither
mergers nor hidden low-mass quiescent galaxies are likely to reconcile the
evolution of the mass function and the star-forming sequence. These results are
supported by observations from {Whitaker} {et~al.} (2014).

combination of the ultraviolet (UV) and infrared (IR), calibrated from a
stacking analysis of Spitzer/MIPS 24$\mu$m imaging; $\beta$-corrected UV SFRs;
and H$\alpha$ SFRs. The normalization of the sequence evolves differently in
distinct mass regimes as well: for galaxies less massive than
$\log(\mathrm{M_{\star}/M_{\odot}})<10$ the specific SFR
($\Psi/\mathrm{M_{\star}}$) is observed to be roughly self-similar with
$\Psi/\mathrm{M_{\star}}\propto(1+z)^{1.9}$, whereas more massive galaxies show
a stronger evolution with $\Psi/\mathrm{M_{\star}}\propto(1+z)^{2.2-3.5}$ for

quasar (QSO2) SDSS J1034+6001 or Mrk 34. The high-quality hard X-ray spectrum
and archival XMM-Newton data can be fitted self-consistently with a
reflection-dominated continuum and strong Fe Kalpha fluorescence line with
equivalent-width >1 keV. Prior X-ray spectral fitting below 10 keV showed the
source to be consistent with being obscured by Compton-thin column densities of
gas along the line-of-sight, despite evidence for much higher columns from
multiwavelength data. NuSTAR now enables a direct measurement of this column,
and shows that Nh lies in the Compton-thick (CT) regime. The new data also show
a high intrinsic 2-10 keV luminosity of L_{2-10}~10^{44} erg/s, in contrast to
previous low-energy X-ray measurements for which L_{2-10}<~10^{43} erg/s (i.e.
X-ray selection below 10 keV does not pick up this source as an intrinsically
luminous obscured quasar). Both the obscuring column and the intrinsic power
are about an order of magnitude (or more) larger than inferred from pre-NuSTAR
X-ray spectral fitting. Mrk34 is thus a 'gold standard' CT QSO2 and is the
nearest non-merging system in this class, in contrast to the other local CT
quasar NGC6240 which is currently undergoing a major merger coupled with strong
star-formation. For typical X-ray bolometric correction factors, the accretion
luminosity of Mrk34 is high enough to potentially power the total infrared
luminosity. X-ray spectral fitting also shows that thermal emission related to
star-formation is unlikely to drive the observed bright soft component below ~3
keV, favoring photionization instead.

III stars forming in a minihalo at $z\simeq25$. Using the smoothed particle
hydrodynamics code GADGET-2, we attain sufficient numerical resolution to
follow gas collapsing into the centre of the minihalo from cosmological initial
conditions up to densities of $10^{12}\,{\rm cm}^{-3}$, at which point we form
sink particles. This allows us to study how the presence of a CXB affects the
formation of H$_2$ and HD in the gas prior to becoming fully molecular. Using a
suite of simulations for a range of possible CXB models, we follow each
simulation for 5000\yr after the first sink particle forms. The CXB provides
two competing effects, with X-rays both heating the gas and increasing the free
electron fraction, allowing more H$_2$ to form. X-ray heating dominates below
$n\sim1\,{\rm cm}^{-3}$, while the additional H$_2$ cooling becomes more
important above $n\sim10^2\,{\rm cm}^{-3}$. The gas becomes optically thick to
X-rays as it exits the quasi-hydrostatic `loitering phase,' such that the
primary impact of the CXB is to cool the gas at intermediate densities,
resulting in an earlier onset of baryonic collapse into the dark matter halo.
At the highest densities, self-shielding results in similar thermodynamic
behaviour across a wide range of CXB strengths. Consequently, we find that star
formation is relatively insensitive to the presence of a CXB; both the number
and the characteristic mass of the stars formed remains quite similar even as
the strength of the CXB varies by several orders of magnitude.

formation struggle to match observed star formation histories of galaxies in
low mass halos (M$_{\rm{H}} \lesssim 10^{11} M_\odot$), predicting more star
formation at high redshift and less star formation at low redshift than
observed. The fundamental problem is that galaxies' gas accretion and star
formation rates are too closely coupled in the models: the accretion rate
largely drives the star formation rate. Observations point to gas accretion
rates that outpace star formation at high redshift, resulting in a buildup of
gas and a delay in star formation until lower redshifts. We present three
empirical adjustments of standard recipes in a semi-analytic model motivated by
three physical scenarios that could cause this decoupling: 1) the mass-loading
factors of outflows driven by stellar feedback may have a steeper dependence on
halo mass at earlier times, 2) the efficiency of star formation may be lower in
low mass halos at high redshift, and 3) gas may not be able to accrete
efficiently onto the disk in low mass halos at high redshift. These new
recipes, once tuned, better reproduce the evolution of $f_\star \equiv
M_\star/M_{\rm{H}}$ as a function of halo mass as derived from abundance
matching over redshifts $z=0$ to $3$, though they have different effects on
cold gas fractions, star formation rates, and metallicities. Changes to gas
accretion and stellar-driven winds are promising, while direct modification of
the star formation timescale requires drastic measures that are not physically
well-motivated.

From these observations, we confirmed that 28 galaxies are at $z\sim6$, of
which ten are clustered in a narrow redshift range of $\Delta z<0.06$. To trace
the evolution of this primordial structure, we applied the same $i'$-dropout
selection and the same overdensity measurements used in the observations to a
semi-analytic model built upon the Millennium Simulation. We obtain a relation
between the significance of overdensities observed at $z\sim6$ and the
predicted dark matter halo mass at $z=0$. This protocluster with $6\sigma$
overdensity is expected to grow into a galaxy cluster with a mass of
$\sim5\times10^{14}\,\mathrm{M_\odot}$ at $z=0$. Ten galaxies within
$10\,\mathrm{comoving\>Mpc}$ of the overdense region can, with more than an 80%
probability, merge into a single dark matter halo by $z=0$. No significant
differences appeared in UV and Ly$\alpha$ luminosities between the protocluster
and field galaxies, suggesting that this protocluster is still in the early
phase of cluster formation before the onset of any obvious environmental
effects. However, further observations are required to study other properties,
such as stellar mass, dust, and age. We do find that galaxies tend to be in
close pairs in this protocluster. These pair-like subgroups will coalesce into
a single halo and grow into a more massive structure. We may witness an onset
of cluster formation at $z\sim6$ toward a cluster as seen in local universe.

prepared and measured using complex sequences of entangling operations. Each
element of such an entangling sequence introduces noise to delicate quantum
information during the encoding or reading out of the code. It is important
therefore to find efficient entangling protocols to avoid the loss of
information. Here we propose an experiment that uses only global entangling
operations to encode an arbitrary logical qubit to either the five-qubit
repetition code or the five-qubit code, with a six-ion Coulomb crystal
architecture in a Penning trap. We show that the use of global operations
enables us to prepare and read out these codes using only six and ten global
entangling pulses, respectively. The proposed experiment also allows the
acquisition of syndrome information during readout. We provide a noise analysis
for the presented protocols, estimating that we can achieve a six-fold
improvement in coherence time with noise as high as $\sim 1\%$ on each
entangling operation.

clustering of extragalactic populations that uses photometric redshift
Probability Distribution Functions in addition to any spectroscopy. This is
advantageous in that all sources in the sample are used in the clustering
analysis, not just the subset with secure spectroscopy. The method works best
for large samples. The loss of accuracy because of the lack of spectroscopy is
balanced by increasing the number of sources used to measure the clustering. We
find that X-ray AGN, far-infrared selected star-forming galaxies and passive
systems in the redshift interval 0.6<z<1.4 are found in halos of similar mass,
$\log M_{DMH}/(M_{\odot}\,h^{-1})\approx13.0$. We argue that this is because
the galaxies in all three samples (AGN, star-forming, passive) have similar
stellar mass distributions, approximated by the J-band luminosity. Therefore
all galaxies that can potentially host X-ray AGN, because they have stellar
masses in the appropriate range, live in dark matter haloes of $\log
M_{DMH}/(M_{\odot}\,h^{-1})\approx13.0$ independent of their star-formation
rates. This suggests that the stellar mass of X-ray AGN hosts is driving the
observed clustering properties of this population. We also speculate that
trends between AGN properties (e.g. luminosity, level of obscuration) and large
scale environment may be related to differences in the stellar mass of the host
galaxies.

heavy quark then propagates through the dense medium, multiply scattering off
the gluon field of the remaining nucleons in its path. We consider the
fictitious process where a heavy quark propagates through the nucleus without
radiation. Invoking Soft-Collinear Effective Theory power counting arguments,
we consider the case of a ""semi-hard"" heavy-quark where the mass is of the
order of the out-going momentum and larger than the transverse momentum
imparted per unit length due to scattering. In this limit, it is found that
longitudinal momentum exchanges (quantified by the transport coefficient
$\hat{e}$) have a comparable effect on the off-shellness of the propagating

constitute the leading cause of off-shellness for propagating light quarks or

of this system are detector readout, attitude control, and cryogenic
housekeeping, for balloon-borne telescopes. Readout of neutron transmutation
doped germanium (NTD-Ge) bolometers requires low noise and parallel acquisition
of hundreds of analog signals. Controlling a telescope's attitude requires the
capability to interface to a wide variety of sensors and motors, and to use
them together in a fast, closed loop. To achieve these different goals, the
BLASTbus system employs a flexible motherboard-daughterboard architecture. The
programmable motherboard features a digital signal processor (DSP) and
field-programmable gate array (FPGA), as well as slots for three
daughterboards. The daughterboards provide the interface to the outside world,
with versions for analog to digital conversion, and optoisolated digital
input/output. With the versatility afforded by this design, the BLASTbus also
finds uses in cryogenic, thermometry, and power systems. For accurate timing
control to tie everything together, the system operates in a fully synchronous
manner. BLASTbus electronics have been successfully deployed to the South Pole,
and flown on stratospheric balloons.

this model, each site of a lattice may be vacant or host single individuals of

a symbiotic manner, having a reduced death rate, $\mu < 1$. Otherwise, the
dynamics follows the rules of the basic CP, with individuals reproducing to
vacant neighbor sites at rate $\lambda$ and dying at a rate of unity. We
determine the full phase diagram in the $\lambda-\mu$ plane in one and two
dimensions by means of exact numerical quasistationary distributions, cluster
approximations, and Monte Carlo simulations. We also study the effects of
asymmetric creation rates and diffusion of individuals. In two dimensions, for
sufficiently strong symbiosis (i.e., small $\mu$), the absorbing-state phase
transition becomes discontinuous for diffusion rates $D$ within a certain
range. We report preliminary results on the critical surface and tricritical

four events in the Hinode data sets have been utilizable. Therefore, increasing
the number of events is required for evaluating the flare trigger models. We
investigated the applicability of data obtained by the Solar Dynamics
Observatory (SDO) to increase the data sample for a statistical analysis of the
flare trigger process. SDO regularly observes the full disk of the sun and all
flares although its spatial resolution is lower than that of Hinode. We
investigated the M6.6 flare which occurred on 13 February 2011 and compared the
analyzed data of SDO with the results of our previous study using Hinode/SOT
data. Filter and vector magnetograms obtained by the Helioseismic and Magnetic
Imager (HMI) and filtergrams from the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) 1600A
were employed. From the comparison of small-scale magnetic configurations and
chromospheric emission prior to the flare onset, we confirmed that the trigger
region is detectable with the SDO data. We also measured the magnetic shear
angles of the active region and the azimuth and strength of the flare-trigger

the first passage problem of a Brownian particle and, regardless of the

in-plane deformations involving both large isotropic and deviatoric strains ---
based on the invariant-theoretic approach to representation of anisotropic
functions. The strain energy density function $\psi$ is expressed in terms of
special scalar-valued functions of the 2D logarithmic strain tensor $ \mathbf
E^{(0)}$ --- called the symmetry-invariants --- that remain invariant w.r.t.
the material symmetry group of graphene, $\mathcal G = \mathcal C_{6v}$. Our
constitutive model conforms to a larger set of \textit{ab initio}
energies/stresses while introducing fewer elastic constants than
previously-proposed models. In particular, when the strain energy is expressed
in terms of symmetry invariants, the material symmetry group is intrinsically
incorporated within the constitutive response functions; consequently, the
elastic constants (of all orders) in the formulation are \textit{a priori}
independent: i.e., no two or more elastic constants are related by symmetry.
This offers substantial simplification in terms of formulation as it eliminates
the need for identifying the independent elastic constants, a task which can
become particularly cumbersome as higher-order terms in the strain energy
density function are incorporated. We validate our constitutive model by
computing (1) the stress and (2) the elastic stability limit for a set of
homogeneous finite deformations --- comprising uniaxial stretch/stress along
the armchair, and the zigzag directions; and equi-biaxial tension. The stress
values predicted by the model are in good agreement with the
directly-calculated \textit{ab initio} values. The elastic stability limits
predicted by acoustic tensor analysis compare well with the predictions from
phonon calculations carried out independently using linear response density
functional perturbation theory.

presented. These simple nonlinear partial differential equations suggested for
both Rossby waves in the atmosphere and also drift waves in a
magnetically-confined plasma exhibit some remarkable and nontrivial properties,
which in their qualitative form survive in more realistic and complicated
models, and as such form a conceptual basis for understanding the turbulence
and zonal flow dynamics in real plasma and geophysical systems. Two idealised
scenarios of generation of zonal flows by small-scale turbulence are explored:
a modulational instability and turbulent cascades.
  A detailed study of the generation of zonal flows by the modulational
instability reveals that the dynamics of this zonal flow generation mechanism
differ widely depending on the initial degree of nonlinearity. A numerical
proof is provided for the extra invariant in Rossby and drift wave turbulence
-zonostrophy and the invariant cascades are shown to be characterised by the
zonostrophy pushing the energy to the zonal scales.
  A small scale instability forcing applied to the model demonstrates the
well-known drift wave - zonal flow feedback loop in which the turbulence which
initially leads to the zonal flow creation, is completely suppressed and the
zonal flows saturate. The turbulence spectrum is shown to diffuse in a manner
which has been mathematically predicted.
  The insights gained from this simple model could provide a basis for
equivalent studies in more sophisticated plasma and geophysical fluid dynamics
models in an effort to fully understand the zonal flow generation, the
turbulent transport suppression and the zonal flow saturation processes in both
the plasma and geophysical contexts as well as other wave and turbulence
systems where order evolves from chaos.

keV band), where M10 is the mass of the black hole in units of 10 solar masses.
An estimate of the luminosity in the broader 0.5-200 keV bandpass gives L/Ledd
= 0.03/M10%, which is still an order of magnitude lower than typical. We also
measured an exponential decay of the X-ray flux in the hard state with an
e-folding time of 3.39+/-0.06 d, which is much less than previous measurements
of 12-15 d during decays by 4U 1630-47 in the soft state. With the ~100 ks
Suzaku observation, we do not see evidence for a reflection component, and the
90% confidence limits on the equivalent width of a narrow iron Kalpha emission
line are <40 eV for a narrow line and <100 eV for a line of any width, which is
consistent with a change of geometry (either a truncated accretion disk or a
change in the location of the hard X-ray source) in the hard state. Finally, we
report a 0.5-8 keV luminosity upper limit of <2e32 erg/s in quiescence, which
is the lowest value measured for 4U 1630-47 to date.

Vaught's Conjecture, then for every limit ordinal $\alpha$ greater than the
quantifier depth of $\phi$ and below $\omega_{2}$, $\phi$ has a model of Scott

constructed at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology. One of the goals of FLUTE
is to generate electron bunches with their length lying in the femtosecond
regime. In the first phase this will be accomplished using a magnetic bunch
compressor. This compressor forms the subject of the studies presented. The
paper is divided into three parts. The first part deals with pure geometric
investigations of the bunch compressor where space charge effects and the back
reaction of bunches with coherent synchrotron radiation (CSR) are neglected.
The second part is dedicated to the treatment of space charge effects and the
third part gives some analytical results on the emission of CSR. The upshot is
that the results of the first and the third part agree quite well with what is
obtained from simulations. However, the space charge forces in the analytical
model of the second part have the trend to be overestimated for large bunch
charges. With this paper we intend to form the basis for future analytical

which a single source broadcasts a data stream to all the users in the system.
Peers are allowed to enter or leave the system (adversarially) arbitrarily.
Previous approaches for streaming in this setting have either used randomized
distribution graphs or structured trees with randomized maintenance algorithms.
Randomized graphs handle peer churn well but have poor connectivity guarantees,
while structured trees have good connectivity but have proven hard to maintain
under peer churn. We improve upon both approaches by presenting a novel
distribution structure with a deterministic and distributed algorithm for
maintenance under peer churn; our result is inspired by a recent work proposing
deterministic algorithms for rumor spreading in graphs. A key innovation in our
approach is in having redundant links in the distribution structure. While this
leads to a reduction in the maximum streaming rate possible, we show that for
the amount of redundancy used, the delay guarantee of the proposed algorithm is
near optimal. We introduce a tolerance parameter that captures the worst-case
transient streaming rate received by the peers during churn events and
characterize the fundamental tradeoff between rate, delay and tolerance. A
natural generalization of the deterministic algorithm achieves this tradeoff
near optimally. Finally, the proposed deterministic algorithm is robust enough
to handle various generalizations: ability to deal with heterogeneous node
capacities of the peers and more complicated streaming patterns where multiple
source transmissions are present.

Fourier-Hermite spectral representation. We describe the propagation of free
energy in phase space using forwards and backwards propagating Hermite modes
recently developed for gyrokinetics [Schekochihin et al. (2014)]. The change in
the electric field corresponds to the net Hermite flux via a free energy
evolution equation. In linear Landau damping, decay in the electric field
corresponds to forward propagating Hermite modes; in nonlinear damping, the
initial decay is followed by a growth phase characterised by the generation of
backwards propagating Hermite modes by the nonlinear term. The free energy
content of the backwards propagating modes increases exponentially until
balancing that of the forward propagating modes. Thereafter there is no
systematic net Hermite flux, so the electric field cannot decay and the
nonlinearity effectively suppresses Landau damping. These simulations are
performed using the fully-spectral 5D gyrokinetics code SpectroGK [Parker et
al. 2014], modified to solve the 1+1D Vlasov-Poisson system. This captures
Landau damping via an iterated L\'enard-Bernstein collision operator or via
Hou-Li filtering in velocity space. Therefore the code is applicable even in
regimes where phase-mixing and filamentation are dominant.

Raman features depends very sensitively on the distance between the graphene
membrane and the Si substrate, which acts as the bottom mirror of the cavity.
Thus, a spatially resolved analysis of the intensity of the G- and 2D-mode

computationally expensive, especially for the large data volumes created by
modern non-coplanar many-element arrays. We present a new widefield
interferometric imager that uses the w-stacking algorithm and can make use of
the w-snapshot algorithm. The performance dependencies of CASA's w-projection
and our new imager are analysed and analytical functions are derived that
describe the required computing cost for both imagers. On data from the
Murchison Widefield Array, we find our new method to be an order of magnitude
faster than w-projection, as well as being capable of full-sky imaging at full
resolution and with correct polarisation correction. We predict the computing
costs for several other arrays and estimate that our imager is a factor of 2-12
faster, depending on the array configuration. We estimate the computing cost
for imaging the low-frequency Square-Kilometre Array observations to be 60
PetaFLOPS with current techniques. We find that combining w-stacking with the
w-snapshot algorithm does not significantly improve computing requirements over
pure w-stacking. The source code of our new imager is publicly released.

quantization, which partitions the stationary ergodic signal denoising into
independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) subsequence denoising; and
(iii) a density estimation approach that approximates the probability
distribution of an i.i.d. sequence by fitting a Gaussian mixture (GM) model. In
addition to the algorithmic framework, we provide three contributions: (i)
numerical results showing that state evolution holds for non-separable Bayesian
sliding-window denoisers; (ii) a universal denoiser that does not require the
input signal to be bounded; and (iii) we modify the GM learning algorithm, and
extend it to an i.i.d. denoiser. Our universal CS recovery algorithm compares
favorably with existing reconstruction algorithms in terms of both

the deformation tensor, the velocity derivative tensor and the gravity Hessian.
Using the Bond-Myers model of ellipsoidal collapse, we derive a new set of
equations for the nine eigenvalues and examine their dynamics in phase space.
The main advantage of this form is that it eliminates the complicated elliptic
integrals that appear in the axes evolution equations and is more natural way
to understand the interplay between the perturbations.
  This paper focuses on the density-velocity dynamics. The Zeldovich
approximation implies that the three tensors are proportional; the
proportionality constant is set by demanding `no decaying modes'. We extend
this condition into the non-linear regime and find that the eigenvalues of the
gravity Hessian and the velocity derivative tensor are related as ${\tilde q}_d
+ {\tilde q}_v=1$, where the triaxiality parameter ${\tilde q} =
(\lambda_{\mathrm{max}} - \lambda_{\mathrm{inter}})/(\lambda_{\mathrm{max}} -
\lambda_{\mathrm{min}})$. This is a {\it new universal relation} holding true
over all redshifts and a range of mass scales to within a few percent accuracy.
The mean density-velocity divergence relation at late times is close to linear,
indicating that the dynamics is dictated by collapse along the largest
eigendirection. This relation has a scatter, which we show, is intimately
connected to the velocity shear. Finally, as an application, we compute the
PDFs of the two variables and compare with other forms in the literature.

singular contributions to the free energy that render the square-to-rhombic

becoming a phenomenon that is increasingly difficult to ignore. This paper
attempts to point to deeper roots of this cultural and social phenomenon. It
concentrates on mathematics education, as the most important and better
documented area of interaction of mathematics with the rest of human culture.
  I argue that new patterns of division of labour have dramatically changed the
nature and role of mathematical skills needed for the labour force and
correspondingly changed the place of mathematics in popular culture and in the
mainstream education. The forces that drive these changes come from the tension
between the ever deepening specialisation of labour and ever increasing length
of specialised training required for jobs at the increasingly sharp cutting
edge of technology.
  Unfortunately these deeper socio-economic origins of the current systemic
crisis of mathematics education are not clearly spelt out, neither in cultural
studies nor, even more worryingly, in the education policy discourse; at the
best, they are only euphemistically hinted at.
  This paper is an attempt to describe the socio-economic landscape of
mathematics education without resorting to euphemisms.

with a variable pitch profile and initially in equilibrium under the action of
a force-free magnetic field. The growth of current-driven (CDI) and
Kelvin-Helmholtz (KHI) instabilities is quantified using three selected cases
corresponding to static, Alfvenic and super-Alfvenic jets.
  During the early stages, we observe large-scale helical deformations of the
jet corresponding to the growth of the initially excited CDI mode. A direct
comparison between our simulation results and the analytical growth rates
obtained from linear theory reveals good agreement on condition that
high-resolution and accurate discretization algorithms are employed.
  After the initial linear phase, the jet structure is significantly altered
and, while slowly-moving jets show increasing helical deformations, larger
velocity shear are violently disrupted on a few Alfven crossing time leaving a
turbulent flow structure. Overall, kinetic and magnetic energies are quickly
dissipated into heat and during the saturated regime the jet momentum is
redistributed on a larger surface area with most of the jet mass travelling at
smaller velocities. The effectiveness of this process is regulated by the onset
of KHI instabilities taking place at the jet/ambient interface and can be held
responsible for vigorous jet braking and entrainment.

two copies of the process) is constructed, using simultaneous collisions, and
parallel coupling of each binary random collision on the sphere of collisional

surely decreasing with respect to time, and the associated quadratic coupling
creation (the time variation of the averaged squared coupling distance) is
computed explicitly. Then, a family (indexed by $\delta > 0$) of $N$-uniform

that both protons and electrons are accelerated in the shock and that these
accelerated particles generate large-amplitude Alfv\'{e}nic waves in the
upstream region of the shock. After the upstream waves have grown sufficiently,
the local structure of the collisionless shock becomes substantially similar to
that of a quasi-perpendicular shock due to the large transverse magnetic field
of the waves. A fraction of protons are accelerated in the shock with a
power-law-like energy distribution. The rate of proton injection to the
acceleration process is approximately constant, and in the injection process,
the phase-trapping mechanism for the protons by the upstream waves can play an
important role. The dominant acceleration process is a Fermi-like process
through repeated shock crossings of the protons. This process is a `fast'
process in the sense that the time required for most of the accelerated protons
to complete one cycle of the acceleration process is much shorter than the
diffusion time. A fraction of the electrons is also accelerated by the same
mechanism, and have a power-law-like energy distribution. However, the
injection does not enter a steady state during the simulation, which may be
related to the intermittent activity of the upstream waves. Upstream of the
shock, a fraction of the electrons is pre-accelerated before reaching the
shock, which may contribute to steady electron injection at a later time.

represented by symmetric positive definite (SPD) matrices. It evaluates the
similarity between two SPD matrices through their eigenvalues. In this paper,
we argue that directly using the original eigenvalues may be problematic
because: i) Eigenvalue estimation becomes biased when the number of samples is
inadequate, which may lead to unreliable kernel evaluation; ii) More
importantly, eigenvalues only reflect the property of an individual SPD matrix.
They are not necessarily optimal for computing Stein kernel when the goal is to
discriminate different sets of SPD matrices. To address the two issues in one
shot, we propose a discriminative Stein kernel, in which an extra parameter
vector is defined to adjust the eigenvalues of the input SPD matrices. The
optimal parameter values are sought by optimizing a proxy of classification
performance. To show the generality of the proposed method, three different
kernel learning criteria that are commonly used in the literature are employed
respectively as a proxy. A comprehensive experimental study is conducted on a
variety of image classification tasks to compare our proposed discriminative
Stein kernel with the original Stein kernel and other commonly used methods for
evaluating the similarity between SPD matrices. The experimental results
demonstrate that, the discriminative Stein kernel can attain greater
discrimination and better align with classification tasks by altering the
eigenvalues. This makes it produce higher classification performance than the
original Stein kernel and other commonly used methods.

galaxies with a wide range of SFR at a given $L_X$. We do not find a
significant correlation between SFR and the observed instantaneous $L_X$ for
star forming AGN host galaxies. However, there is a weak but significant
correlation between the mean $L_\mathrm{X}$ and SFR of detected AGN in star
forming galaxies, which likely reflects that $L_\mathrm{X}$ varies on shorter
timescales than SFR. We find no correlation between stellar mass and
$L_\mathrm{X}$ within the AGN population. Within both populations of star
forming and quiescent galaxies, we find a similar power-law distribution in the
probability of hosting an AGN as a function of specific accretion rate.
Furthermore, at a given stellar mass, we find a star forming galaxy $\sim2-3$
more likely than a quiescent galaxy to host an AGN of a given specific
accretion rate. The probability of a galaxy hosting an AGN is constant across
the main sequence of star formation. These results indicate that there is an
underlying connection between star formation and the presence of AGN, but AGN
are often hosted by quiescent galaxies.

  way to distinguish between prograde and retrograde motion I. Theory","V2: Major revision, accepted to ApJ",,"10.1088/0004-637X/800/2/142",,"astro-ph.SR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Some transiting planets discovered by the Kepler mission display transit
timing variations (TTVs) induced by stellar spots that rotate on the visible
hemisphere of their parent stars. An induced TTV can be observed when a planet
crosses a spot and modifies the shape of the transit light curve, even if the
time resolution of the data does not allow to detect the crossing event itself.
We present an approach that can, in some cases, use the derived TTVs of a
planet to distinguish between a prograde and a retrograde planetary motion with
respect to the stellar rotation. Assuming a single spot darker than the stellar
disc, spot crossing by the planet can induce measured positive (negative) TTV,
if the crossing occurs in the first (second) half of the transit. On the other
hand, the motion of the spot towards (away from) the center of the stellar
visible disc causes the stellar brightness to decrease (increase). Therefore,
for a planet with prograde motion, the induced TTV is positive when the local
slope of the stellar flux at the time of transit is negative, and vice versa.
Thus, we can expect to observe a negative (positive) correlation between the
TTVs and the photometric slopes for prograde (retrograde) motion. Using a
simplistic analytical approximation, and also the publicly available SOAP-T
tool to produce light curves of transits with spot-crossing events, we show for
some cases how the induced TTVs depend on the local stellar photometric slopes
at the transit timings. Detecting this correlation in Kepler transiting systems
with high enough signal-to-noise ratio can allow us to distinguish between
prograde and retrograde planetary motions. In coming papers we present analyses
of the KOIs and Kepler eclipsing binaries, following the formalism developed
here.

BICEP2 results, taking care of possible transient violations of the slow-roll
conditions as the field passes from the large field to the vacuum dominated
phase. The usual regime where observable scales exit the Hubble radius in the
vacuum dominated phase predicts a blue scalar spectrum, which is ruled out. But
whereas assuming slow-roll one expects this regime to be generic, by solving
the exact dynamics we identify the parameter space for which the small field
phase is naturally avoided due to slow-roll violations at the end of the large
field phase. When the number of e-folds generated at small field is negligible,
the model predictions are degenerated with those of a quadratic potential.
There exists also a transitory case for which the small field phase is
sufficiently long to affect importantly the observable predictions.
Interestingly, in this case the spectral index and the tensor to scalar ratio
agree respectively with the best fit of Planck and BICEP2. This results in a
\Delta \chi^2 \simeq 5.0 in favor of hybrid inflation for Planck+BICEP2 (\Delta
\chi^2 \simeq 0.9 for Planck only). The last considered regime is when the
critical point at which inflation ends is located in the large field phase. It
is constrained to be lower than about ten times the reduced Planck mass. The
analysis has been conducted with the use of Markov-Chain-Monte-Carlo bayesian
method, in a reheating consistent way, and we present the posterior probability
distributions for all the model parameters.

mass-luminosity relation, shows peaks at substellar (~0.08-0.18 Msolar) and
intermediate (~1-1.78 Msolar) mass ranges for the IRS 1-3 region. The MF can be

operating successfully at the Canary Island of La Palma. Apart from its purpose
to serve as a monitoring facility for the brightest TeV blazars, it was built
as a major step to establish solid state photon counters as detectors in
Cherenkov astronomy.
  The camera of the First G-APD Cherenkov Telesope comprises 1440 Geiger-mode
avalanche photo diodes (G-APD aka. MPPC or SiPM) for photon detection. Since
properties as the gain of G-APDs depend on temperature and the applied voltage,
a real-time feedback system has been developed and implemented. To correct for
the change introduced by temperature, several sensors have been placed close to
the photon detectors. Their read out is used to calculate a corresponding
voltage offset. In addition to temperature changes, changing current introduces
a voltage drop in the supporting resistor network. To correct changes in the
voltage drop introduced by varying photon flux from the night-sky background,
the current is measured and the voltage drop calculated. To check the stability
of the G-APD properties, dark count spectra with high statistics have been
taken under different environmental conditions and been evaluated.
  The maximum data rate delivered by the camera is about 240 MB/s. The recorded
data, which can exceed 1 TB in a moonless night, is compressed in real-time
with a proprietary loss-less algorithm. The performance is better than gzip by
almost a factor of two in compression ratio and speed. In total, two to three
CPU cores are needed for data taking. In parallel, a quick-look analysis of the
recently recorded data is executed on a second machine. Its result is publicly
available within a few minutes after the data were taken.

we consider a random element $(X, Z)$ taking values in some semi-metric
abstract space $E\times F$. For a real function $\varphi$ defined on the space
$F$ and $x\in E$, we consider the conditional mode of the real random variable

function, say $\theta_\varphi(x)$, using the well-known kernel estimator, we
establish the strong consistency with rate of this estimate uniformly over
Vapnik-Chervonenkis classes of functions $\varphi$. Notice that the ergodic
setting offers a more general framework than the usual mixing structure. Two
applications to energy data are provided to illustrate some examples of the
proposed approach in time series forecasting framework. The first one consists
in forecasting the {\it daily peak} of electricity demand in France (measured

Bi-films and the LaAlO$_{3}$/SrTiO$_{3}$ interface in the presence and absence
of a magnetic field applied perpendicular to the system. Our main aim is to
explore the occurrence of Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) and quantum
phase transition behavior in the presence of limited size, stemming from the
finite extent of the homogeneous domains or the magnetic field. Moreover we
explore the implications thereof. Above an extrapolated BKT transition
temperature, modulated by the thickness $d$, gate voltage $%V_{g}$ or magnetic
field $H$, we identify a temperature range where BKT behavior occurs. Its range
is controlled by the relevant limiting lengths,which are set by the extent of
the homogeneous domains or the magnetic field. The extrapolated BKT transition
lines $T_{c}\left(d,V_{g},H\right) $ uncover compatibility with the occurrence
of a quantum phase transition where $T_{c}\left( d_{c},V_{gc},H_{c}\right) =0$.
However, an essential implication of the respective limiting length is that the
extrapolated phase transition lines $T_{c}\left( d,V_{g},H\right) $ are
unattainable. Consequently, given a finite limiting length, BKT and quantum
phase transitions do not occur. Nevertheless, BKT and quantum critical behavior
is observable, controlled by the extent of the relevant limiting length.
Additional results and implications include: the magnetic field induced finite
size effect generates a flattening out of the sheet resistance in the
$T\rightarrow 0$ limit, while in zero field it exhibits a characteristic
temperature dependence and vanishes at $T=0$ only. The former prediction is
confirmed in both, the Bi-films and the LaAlO$_{3}$/SrTiO$_{3}$ interface, as
well as in previous studies. The latter is consistent with the
LaAlO$_{3}$/SrTiO$_{3}$ interface data, while the Bi-films exhibit a flattening
out.

from small-scale efforts involving just a few domain experts to large-scale

Adaptive Optics (FLAO) mounted at the Large Binocular Telescope (LBT). The

of R<13 mag. During these observations the seeing was on average ~0.9"". The AO
performed very well: the images display a mean FWHM of 0.05 arcsec and of 0.06
arcsec in the J- and in the Ks-band, respectively. The Strehl ratio on the
quoted images reaches 13-30% (J) and 50-65% (Ks), in the off and in the central
pointings respectively. On the basis of this sample we have reached a J-band
limiting magnitude of ~22.5 mag and the deepest Ks-band limiting magnitude ever
obtained in a crowded stellar field: Ks~23 mag.
  J-band images display a complex change in the shape of the PSF when moving at
larger radial distances from the natural guide star. In particular, the stellar
images become more elongated in approaching the corners of the J-band images
whereas the Ks-band images are more uniform. We discuss in detail the strategy
used to perform accurate and deep photometry in these very challenging images.
In particular we will focus our attention on the use of an updated version of
ROMAFOT based on asymmetric and analytical Point Spread Functions.
  The quality of the photometry allowed us to properly identify a feature that
clearly shows up in NIR bands: the main sequence knee (MSK). The MSK is
independent of the evolutionary age, therefore the difference in magnitude with
the canonical clock to constrain the cluster age, the main sequence turn off
(MSTO), provides an estimate of the absolute age of the cluster. The key
advantage of this new approach is that the error decreases by a factor of two
when compared with the classical one. Combining ground-based Ks with space
F606W photometry, we estimate the absolute age of M15 to be 13.70+-0.80 Gyr.

the energy-momentum tensor, implying non-geodesic motion and consequently leads
to the appearance of an extra force. Applied to the cosmological context, these
curvature-matter couplings lead to interesting phenomenology, where one can
obtain a unified description of the cosmological epochs. We also consider the
possibility that the behavior of the galactic flat rotation curves can be
explained in the framework of the curvature-matter coupling models, where the
extra-terms in the gravitational field equations modify the equations of motion
of test particles, and induce a supplementary gravitational interaction. In
addition to this, these models are extremely useful for describing dark

breaks down in these cases. We show how the spin magnetic moment of the
impurity that normally would be quenched can be restored upon introducing a gap
at the Fermi level in the host density of states. The magnitude of the impurity
spin magnetic moment scales monotonically with the size of the band gap. This
observation even holds for a host material featuring a strongly discretized

doped nano-particles by varying their size and thereby their band gap.

To appear in MNRAS Letters",,"10.1093/mnrasl/slu109",,"astro-ph.HE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We derive simple and explicit expressions for the high frequency spectrum of
a classical accretion disc. Both stress-free and finite stress inner boundaries
are considered. A classical accretion disc spectrum with a stress-free inner
boundary departs from a Wien spectrum at large $\nu$, scaling as $\nu^{2.5}$
(as opposed to $\nu^3$) times the usual exponential cut-off. If there is finite
stress at the inner disc boundary, the maximum disc temperature generally
occurs at this edge, even at relatively modest values of the stress. In this
case, the high frequency spectrum is proportional to $\nu^2$ times the
exponential cut-off. If the temperature maximum is a local hot spot, instead of
an axisymmetric ring, then an interior maximum produces a $\nu^2$ prefactor
while an edge maximum yields $\nu^{1.5}$. Because of beaming effects, these
latter findings should pertain to a classical relativistic disc. The
asymptotics are in general robust and independent of the detailed temperature
profile, provided only that the liberated free energy of differential rotation
is dissipated locally, and may prove useful beyond the strict domain of
classical disc theory. As observations continue to improve with time, our
findings suggest the possibility of using the high energy spectral component of
black hole candidates as a signature prediction of classical theory, as well as
an diagnostic of the stress at the inner regions of an accretion disc.

to Gauss, we enforce the constraint of isochoric deformations exactly to
develop a linear theory with perfect volume conservation that remains valid
until strains become geometrically large. We demonstrate the utility of this
approach by calculating the response of an infinite soft isochoric solid to a
point force that leads to a nonlinear generalization of the Kelvin solution.
Our approach naturally generalizes to a range of problems involving
deformations of soft solids and interfaces in 2 dimensional and axisymmetric

weight at most (or at least) $W$. We use our general framework to obtain
efficient algorithms for such fundamental graph problems as Vertex Cover,
3-Hitting Set, Edge Dominating Set and Max Internal Out-Branching. The best
known algorithms for these problems admit running times of the form $c^W
n^{O(1)}$, for some constant $c>1$. We improve these running times to $c^s
n^{O(1)}$, where $s\leq W$ is the minimum size of a solution of weight at most
(at least) $W$. If no such solution exists, $s=\min\{W,m\}$, where $m$ is the
maximum size of a solution. Clearly, $s$ can be substantially smaller than $W$.
In particular, the running times of our algorithms are (almost) the same as the
best known $O^*$ running times for the unweighted variants. Thus, we solve the
weighted versions of
  * Vertex Cover in $1.381^s n^{O(1)}$ time and $n^{O(1)}$ space.

become increasingly important for ab initio quantum chemistry. Its underlying
wavefunction ansatz, the matrix product state (MPS), is a low-rank
decomposition of the full configuration interaction tensor. The virtual
dimension of the MPS, the rank of the decomposition, controls the size of the
corner of the many-body Hilbert space that can be reached with the ansatz. This
parameter can be systematically increased until numerical convergence is
reached. The MPS ansatz naturally captures exponentially decaying correlation
functions. Therefore DMRG works extremely well for noncritical one-dimensional
systems. The active orbital spaces in quantum chemistry are however often far
from one-dimensional, and relatively large virtual dimensions are required to
use DMRG for ab initio quantum chemistry (QC-DMRG). The QC-DMRG algorithm, its
computational cost, and its properties are discussed. Two important aspects to
reduce the computational cost are given special attention: the orbital choice
and ordering, and the exploitation of the symmetry group of the Hamiltonian.
With these considerations, the QC-DMRG algorithm allows to find numerically
exact solutions in active spaces of up to 40 electrons in 40 orbitals.

innovations. Moreover, this resulted in network policies having complex
interfaces that are not user-friendly and hence resulted in huge and
complicated flow tables on physical switches of networks. This greatly degrades
the network performance in many cases. Software-Defined Networks (SDNs) is a
modern architecture of networks to overcome issues mentioned above. The idea of
SDN is to add to the network a controller device that manages all the other
devices on the network including physical switches of the network. One of the
main tasks of the managing process is switch learning; achieved via programming
physical switches of the network by adding or removing rules for
packet-processing to/from switches, more specifically to/from their flow
tables. A high-level imperative network programming language, called ImpNet, is
presented in this paper. ImpNet enables writing efficient, yet simple, and
powerful programs to run on the controller to control all other network devices
including switches. ImpNet is compositional, simply-structured, expressive, and
more importantly imperative. The syntax of ImpNet together two types of
operational semantics to contracts of ImpNet are presented in the paper. The
proposed semantics are of the static and dynamic types. Two modern application
programmed using ImpNet are shown in the paper as well. The semantics of the

dependent magnetoresistance (aMR) measurements on the same device, we are able
to verify that a small spin heat accumulation builds up in our devices. From
the SDSE measurement and the observed current driven STT switching current of
0.8 mA in our spin valve devices, it was estimated that a temperature
difference of 230 K is needed to produce an equal amount of TSTT. Experiments
specifically focused on investigating TSTT show a response that is dominated by
overall heating of the magnetic layer. Comparing it to the current driven STT
experiments we estimate that only ~10% of the response is due to TSTT. This
leads us to conclude that switching dominated by TSTT requires a direct
coupling to a perfect heat sink to minimize the effect of overall heating.
Nevertheless the combined effect of heating, STT and TSTT could prove useful
for inducing magnetization switching when further investigated and optimized.

spectrometer observations of high-J CO lines up to J=20-19 and JCMT
observations of $^{13}$CO and HCN to discern between UV heating and alternative
heating mechanisms. There is an immediately noticeable difference in the
spectra of Arp 299 A and Arp 299 B+C, with source A having brighter high-J CO
transitions. This is reflected in their respective spectral energy line
distributions. We find that photon-dominated regions (PDRs) are unlikely to
heat all the gas since a very extreme PDR is necessary to fit the high-J CO
lines. In addition, this extreme PDR does not fit the HCN observations, and the
dust spectral energy distribution shows that there is not enough hot dust to
match the amount expected from such an extreme PDR. Therefore, we determine
that the high-J CO and HCN transitions are heated by an additional mechanism,
namely cosmic ray heating, mechanical heating, or X-ray heating. We find that
mechanical heating, in combination with UV heating, is the only mechanism that
fits all molecular transitions. We also constrain the molecular gas mass of Arp
299 A to 3e9 Msun and find that we need 4% of the total heating to be
mechanical heating, with the rest UV heating.

conversion between these isomers is forbidden and they act as different
molecular species. Yet, these species are not readily separable, and little is
known about their specific physical and chemical properties, conversion
mechanisms, or interactions. Here we demonstrate the production of isolated
samples of both spin isomers in pure beams of para and ortho water, with both
species in their respective absolute ground state. These single-quantum-state
samples are ideal targets for unraveling spin-conversion mechanisms, for
precision spectroscopy and fundamental-symmetry-breaking studies, and for
spin-enhanced applications, e. g., laboratory astrophysics and -chemistry or
hypersensitized NMR experiments.

provide group-theoretic interpretation for several dualities discovered
originally by Ruijsenaars. In the group-theoretic framework one applies
Hamiltonian reduction to two Abelian Poisson algebras of invariants on a higher
dimensional phase space and identifies their reductions as action and position
variables of two integrable systems living on two different models of the
single reduced phase space. Taking the cotangent bundle of U(2n) as the
upstairs space, we demonstrate how this mechanism leads to a new dual pair
involving the BC(n) trigonometric Sutherland system. Thereby we generalize
earlier results pertaining to the A(n) trigonometric Sutherland system as well
as a recent work by Pusztai on the hyperbolic BC(n) Sutherland system.

enables the homogenisation of elastic lattices at non-zero frequencies is
developed. Elastic lattices are distinguished from scalar lattices in that two
or more types of coupled waves exist, even at low frequencies. Such a theory
enables the determination of effective material properties at both low and high
frequencies. The theoretical framework is developed for the propagation of
waves through lattices of arbitrary geometry and dimension. The asymptotic
approach provides a method through which the dispersive properties of lattices
at frequencies near standing waves can be described; the theory accurately
describes both the dispersion curves and the response of the lattice near the
edges of the Brillouin zone. The leading order solution is expressed as a
product between the standing wave solution and long-scale envelope functions
that are eigensolutions of the homogenised partial differential equation. The
general theory is supplemented by a pair of illustrative examples for two
archetypal classes of two-dimensional elastic lattices. The efficiency of the
asymptotic approach in accurately describing several interesting phenomena is
demonstrated, including dynamic anisotropy and Dirac cones.

clustering problem, given $k, q$ and norm $\rho \in [1,\infty]$, we have to
compute a set $\mathcal{F}$ of $k$ $q$-dimensional flats such that $(\sum_{p\in
P}d(p, \mathcal{F})^\rho)^{1/\rho}$ is minimized; here $d(p, \mathcal{F})$
represents the (Euclidean) distance of $p$ to the closest flat in
$\mathcal{F}$. We let $f_k^q(P,\rho)$ denote the minimal value and interpret
$f_k^q(P,\infty)$ to be $\max_{r\in P}d(r, \mathcal{F})$. When $\rho=1,2$ and
$\infty$ and $q=0$, the problem corresponds to the $k$-median, $k$-mean and the
$k$-center clustering problems respectively.
  For every $0 < \epsilon < 1$, $S\subset P$ and $\rho \ge 1$, we show that the
orthogonal projection of $P$ onto a randomly chosen flat of dimension
$O(((q+1)^2\log(1/\epsilon)/\epsilon^3) \log n)$ will $\epsilon$-approximate
$f_1^q(S,\rho)$. This result combines the concepts of geometric coresets and
subspace embeddings based on the Johnson-Lindenstrauss Lemma. As a consequence,
an orthogonal projection of $P$ to an $O(((q+1)^2 \log

$\epsilon$-approximates projective clusterings for every $k$ and $\rho$

number of clusters~$k$.
  Using this dimension reduction result, we obtain new approximation and
streaming algorithms for projective clustering problems. For example, given a
stream of $n$ points, we show how to compute an $\epsilon$-approximate
projective clustering for every $k$ and $\rho$ simultaneously using only
$O((n+d)((q+1)^2\log ((q+1)/\epsilon))/\epsilon^3 \log n)$ space. Compared to
standard streaming algorithms with $\Omega(kd)$ space requirement, our approach
is a significant improvement when the number of input points and their

measurements of the variations of planet-to-star radius ratio as a function of
wavelength, is a powerful technique to study the atmospheric properties of
transiting planets. One of the main limitation of this technique is the effects
of stellar activity, which up until now, have been taken into account only by
assessing the effect of non-occulted stellar spots on the estimates of
planet-to-star radius ratio. In this paper, we study, for the first time, the
impact of the occultation of a stellar spot and plage on the transmission
spectra of transiting exoplanets. We simulated this effect by generating a
large number of transit light curves for different transiting planets, stellar
spectral types, and for different wavelengths. Results of our simulations
indicate that the anomalies inside the transit light curve can lead to a
significant underestimation or overestimation of the planet-to-star radius
ratio as a function of wavelength. At short wavelengths, the effect can reach
to a difference of up to 10% in the planet-to-star radius ratio, mimicking the
signature of light scattering in the planetary atmosphere. Atmospheric
scattering has been proposed to interpret the increasing slopes of transmission
spectra toward blue for exoplanets HD 189733b and GJ 3470b. Here we show that
these signatures can be alternatively interpreted by the occultation of stellar
plages. Results also suggest that the best strategy to identify and quantify
the effects of stellar activities on the transmission spectrum of a planet is
to perform several observations during the transit epoch at the same
wavelength. This will allow for identifying the possible variations in transit
depth as a function of time due to stellar activity variability.

existing tools for graphical visualization of protein interactions in general,
there is no tool that can draw protein interactions with MIM notation with full
support. Results: MIMTool was developed for drawing protein interaction maps in
Kohn's MIM notation. MIMTool was developed using the Qt toolkit libraries and
introduces several unique features such as full interactivity, object dragging,
ability to export files in MIMML, SBML and line drawing with automatic bending

MIMTool also has a unique orthogonal edge drawing method that is both easy and

in biological research. With the ever-increasing resolution of modern
microscopes the data set size of the scanned specimen grows steadily. On
commodity hardware this size easily exceeds the available main memory and the
even more limited GPU memory. Common volume rendering techniques require the
entire data set to be present in the GPU memory. Existing out-of-core rendering
approaches for large volume data sets either are limited to single-channel
volumes, or require a computer cluster, or have long preprocessing times.
Results: We introduce a ray-casting technique for rendering large volumetric
multi-channel microscopy data streams on commodity hardware. The volumetric
data is managed at different levels of detail by an octree structure. In
contrast to previous octree-based techniques, the octree is built incrementally
and therefore supports streamed microscopy data as well as data set sizes
exceeding the available main memory. Furthermore, our approach allows the user
to interact with the partially rendered data set at all stages of the octree
construction. After a detailed description of our method, we present
performance results for different multi-channel data sets with a size of up to
24 GB on a standard desktop PC. Conclusions: Our rendering technique allows
biologists to visualize their scanned specimen on their standard desktop
computers without high-end hardware requirements. Furthermore, the user can
interact with the data set during the initial loading to explore the already
loaded parts, change rendering parameters like color maps or adjust clipping
planes. Thus, the time of biologists being idle is reduced. Also, streamed data
can be visualized to detect and stop flawed scans early during the scan
process.

phase transitions in the ground state of a two-qubit system interacting with a
dissipative reservoir. First, the ground state phase diagram is analyzed in the
presence of the Ohmic and sub-Ohmic bath using an analytic ground state wave
function which takes into account the competition between intrasite tunneling
and intersite correlation. The quantum critical point is determined as the
transition point from non-degenerate to degenerate ground state and our
calculated critical coupling strength $\alpha_c$ agrees with that from the
numerical renormalization group method. Moreover, by computing the entanglement
entropy between the qubits and the bath as well as the qubit-qubit correlation
function in the ground state, we explore the nature of the quantum phase
transition between the delocalized and localized states.

solar masses, which are expected to occur following the mergers of their host
galaxies, produce strong millihertz gravitational radiation. Observations of
these systems will trace the hierarchical assembly of structure in the Universe

Reionization (LOFAR-EoR) data. We use the high band antennas of LOFAR to image
this region and RM-synthesis to unravel structures of polarized emission at
high Galactic latitudes. The brightness temperature of the detected Galactic
emission is on average 4 K in polarized intensity and covers the range from -10
to +13rad m^-2 in Faraday depth. The total polarized intensity and polarization
angle show a wide range of morphological features. We have also used the
Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope (WSRT) at 350 MHz to image the same
region. The LOFAR and WSRT images show a similar complex morphology, at
comparable brightness levels, but their spatial correlation is very low. The
fractional polarization at 150 MHz, expressed as a percentage of the total
intensity, amounts to 1.5%. There is no indication of diffuse emission in total
intensity in the interferometric data, in line with results at higher
frequencies. The wide frequency range, good angular resolution and good
sensitivity make LOFAR an exquisite instrument for studying Galactic polarized
emission at a resolution of 1-2 rad m^-2 in Faraday depth. The different
polarised patterns observed at 150 MHz and 350 MHz are consistent with
different source distributions along the line of sight wring in a variety of
Faraday thin regions of emission. The presence of polarised foregrounds is a
serious complication for Epoch of Reionization experiments. To avoid the
leakage of polarized emission into total intensity, which can depend on
frequency, we need to calibrate the instrumental polarization across the field
of view to a small fraction of 1%.

modified the internal mechanism of the spring-wound ""clockwork"" slightly, such
that the natural frequency and the internal damping could be independently

small linear displacement of the base coupling the two. Our results indicate
that such a system can be made to stabilize in both in-phase anti-phase

demonstrated for several disease related loci. Conclusions: As of today, inPHAP
is the only visual analytical tool that allows the user to explore unphased and
phased haplotype data interactively. Due to its highly scalable design, inPHAP
can be applied to large datasets with up to 100 GB of data, enabling users to
visualize even large scale input data. inPHAP closes the gap between common
visualization tools for unphased genotype data and introduces several new
features, such as the visualization of phased data.

  aggregations",,,,,"q-bio.PE math.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The last two decades have seen a surge in kinetic and macroscopic models
derived to investigate the multi-scale aspects of self-organised biological
aggregations. Because the individual-level details incorporated into the
kinetic models (e.g., individual speeds and turning rates) make them somewhat
difficult to investigate, one is interested in transforming these models into
simpler macroscopic models, by using various scaling techniques that are
imposed by the biological assumptions of the models. Here, we consider three
scaling approaches (parabolic, hydrodynamic and grazing collision limits) that
can be used to reduce a class of non-local 1D and 2D models for biological
aggregations to simpler models existent in the literature. Next, we investigate
how some of the spatio-temporal patterns exhibited by the original kinetic
models are preserved via these scalings. To this end, we focus on the parabolic
scaling for non-local 1D models and apply asymptotic preserving numerical
methods, which allow us to analyse changes in the patterns as the scaling
coefficient $\epsilon$ is varied from $\epsilon=1$ (for 1D transport models) to
$\epsilon=0$ (for 1D parabolic models). We show that some patterns (describing
stationary aggregations) are preserved in the limit $\epsilon\to 0$, while
other patterns (describing moving aggregations) are lost in this limit. To
understand the loss of these patterns, we construct bifurcation diagrams.

of the semantics of logic programs with complex terms. The presence of function
symbols in the program may render the ground instantiation infinite, and
finiteness of models and termination of the evaluation procedure, in the
general case, are not guaranteed anymore. Since the program termination problem
is undecidable in the general case, several decidable criteria (called program
termination criteria) have been recently proposed. However, current conditions
are not able to identify even simple programs, whose bottom-up execution always
terminates. The paper introduces new decidable criteria for checking
termination of logic programs with function symbols under bottom-up evaluation,
by deeply analyzing the program structure. First, we analyze the propagation of
complex terms among arguments by means of the extended version of the argument
graph called propagation graph. The resulting criterion, called
Gamma-acyclicity, generalizes most of the decidable criteria proposed so far.
Next, we study how rules may activate each other and define a more powerful
criterion, called safety. This criterion uses the so-called safety function
able to analyze how rules may activate each other and how the presence of some
arguments in a rule limits its activation. We also study the application of the
proposed criteria to bound queries and show that the safety criterion is
well-suited to identify relevant classes of programs and bound queries.
Finally, we propose a hierarchy of classes of terminating programs, called
k-safety, where the k-safe class strictly includes the (k-1)-safe class. Note:

ideally modeled and analyzed by one archetypal statistical framework - the
Graphical Probabilistic Model (GPM). The structure of GPMs is a uniquely good
match for biological problems that range from aligning sequences to modeling
the genome-to-phenome relationship. The fundamental questions that GPMs address
involve making decisions based on a complex web of interacting factors.
Unfortunately, while GPMs ideally fit many questions in biology, they are not
an easy solution to apply. Building a GPM is not a simple task for an end user.
Moreover, applying GPMs is also impeded by the insidious fact that the complex
web of interacting factors inherent to a problem might be easy to define and
also intractable to compute upon. Discussion: We propose that the visualization
sciences can contribute to many domains of the bio-sciences, by developing
tools to address archetypal representation and user interaction issues in GPMs,
and in particular a variety of GPM called a Conditional Random Field(CRF). CRFs
bring additional power, and additional complexity, because the CRF dependency
network can be conditioned on the query data. Conclusions: In this manuscript
we examine the shared features of several biological problems that are amenable
to modeling with CRFs, highlight the challenges that existing visualization and
visual analytics paradigms induce for these data, and document an experimental
solution called StickWRLD which, while leaving room for improvement, has been
successfully applied in several biological research projects.

present Multiresolution Correlation Analysis (MCA), a method for visually
identifying subpopulations based on the local pairwise correlation between
covariates, without needing to define an a priori interaction scale. We
demonstrate that MCA facilitates the identification of differentially regulated
subpopulations in simulated data from a small gene regulatory network, followed
by application to previously published single-cell qPCR data from mouse
embryonic stem cells. We show that MCA recovers previously identified
subpopulations, provides additional insight into the underlying correlation
structure, reveals potentially spurious compartmentalizations, and provides
insight into novel subpopulations. Conclusions: MCA is a useful method for the
identification of subpopulations in low-dimensional expression data, as
emerging from qPCR or FACS measurements. With MCA it is possible to investigate
the robustness of covariate correlations with respect subpopulations,
graphically identify outliers, and identify factors contributing to
differential regulation between pairs of covariates. MCA thus provides a
framework for investigation of expression correlations for genes of interests
and biological hypothesis generation.

increase the responsivity to incoming power. The strained silicon absorber is
coupled to a planar aluminium twin-slot antenna designed to couple to

technique for the measurement of intermediate-k ($k_{\bot} \rho_i \sim 1$, and
higher) density fluctuations and flows in magnetically confined fusion

scattering alignment on toroidal launch angle. We also present comparisons of
DBS plasma velocity measurements with charge exchange recombination and beam
emission spectroscopy measurements, which show reasonable agreement over most

shown to enable high-k measurements with DBS, at $k_{\bot}>20\

presented in projections of Q$^2$ or -t'. Violation of s-channel helicity

from unnatural-parity-exchange amplitudes is found and the phase shift between
those amplitudes that describe transverse $\omega$ production by longitudinal
and transverse virtual photons, $\gamma^{*}_{L} \to \omega_{T}$ and
$\gamma^{*}_{T} \to \omega_{T}$, is determined for the first time. A hierarchy
of helicity amplitudes is established, which mainly means that the
unnatural-parity-exchange amplitude describing the $\gamma^*_T \to \omega_T$
transition dominates over the two natural-parity-exchange amplitudes describing
the $\gamma^*_L \to \omega_L$ and $\gamma^*_T \to \omega_T$ transitions, with
the latter two being of similar magnitude. Good agreement is found between the
HERMES proton data and results of a pQCD-inspired phenomenological model that
includes pion-pole contributions, which are of unnatural parity.

Spitzer Infrared Spectrometer (IRS) when its equator was close to the sub-earth
point. This spectrum provides the highest-resolution broad-band spectrum ever
obtained for Uranus from space, allowing a determination of the disk-averaged
temperature and molecule composition to a greater degree of accuracy than ever
before. The temperature profiles derived from the Voyager radio occultation
experiments that match these data best are those that assume a high abundance
of methane in the deep atmosphere, but none of these models provides a
satisfactory fit over the full spectral range. This be the result of spatial
differences between global and low-latitudinal regions, changes in time,
missing continuum opacity sources such as stratospheric hazes or unknown
tropospheric constituents, or undiagnosed systematic problems with either the
radio-occultation or the Spitzer IRS data sets. The spectrum is compatible with
the stratospheric temperatures derived from the Voyager ultraviolet
occultations measurements. Thermospheric temperatures determined from the
analysis of the observed H2 quadrupole emission features are colder than those
derived by Herbert et al. at pressures less than ~1 microbar. Extrapolation of
the nominal model spectrum to far-infrared through millimeter wavelengths shows
that the spectrum arising solely from H2 collision-induced absorption is too
warm to reproduce observations between wavelengths of 0.8 and 3.3 mm. Adding an
additional absorber such as H2S provides a reasonable match to the spectrum,
although a unique identification of the responsible absorber is not yet
possible with available data. An immediate practical use for the spectrum
resulting from this model is to establish a high-precision continuum flux model
for use as an absolute radiometric standard for future astronomical
observations.

to drastically change our vision of the field. Indeed the theoretical criterium
of naturalness required the presence of new physics at the TeV scale. At

the first catalogue of optically variable sources observed by OMC/INTEGRAL,
which contains photometric data for more than 1000 eclipsing binaries. Five
objects were found and a detailed analysis of one of them, DY Aqr, has been
performed. Photometric and spectroscopic observations of DY Aqr were obtained
to analyse the binary system and the pulsational characteristics of the primary
component. By applying the binary modelling software phoebe to the OMC and
ground-based photometric light curves, and to the radial velocity curve
obtained using echelle high-resolution spectroscopy, the physical parameters of
the system have been determined. Frequency analysis of the residual data has
been performed using Fourier techniques to identify pulsational frequencies. We
have built a grid of theoretical models to classify spectroscopically the
primary component as an A7.5V star (plus or minus one spectral subtype). The
best orbital fit was obtained for a semi-detached system configuration.
According to the binary modelling, the primary component has Teff = 7625+-125 K
and log g = 4.1+-0.1 and the secondary component has Teff = 3800+-200 K and log
g = 3.3+-0.1, although it is too faint to isolate its spectral features. From
the analysis of the residuals we have found a main pulsation frequency at 23.37
c/d, which is typical of a delta Scuti star. In the O-C diagram no evidence of
orbital period changes over the last 8 years has been found.

localization in the setting of local quantum physics. Unlike QM it does not
refer to individual operators but rather to ensembles of observables which
share the same localization region, as a result it explains the probabilistic
aspects of QFT in terms of the impure KMS nature arising from the local
restriction of the pure vacuum. Whereas it played no important role in the
perturbation theory of low spin particles, it becomes indispensible for
interactions which involve higher spin $s\geq1$ fields, where is leads to the
replacement of the operator (BRST) gauge theory setting in Krein space by a new
formulation in terms of stringlocal fields in Hilbert space. The main purpose
of this paper is to present new results which lead to a rethinking of important
issues of the Standard Model concerning massive gauge theories and the Higgs
mechanism. We place these new findings into the broader context of ongoing
conceptual changes within QFT which already led to new nonperturbative
constructions of models of integrable QFTs. It is also pointed out that modular
localization does not support ideas coming from string theory, as extra
dimensions and Kaluza-Klein dimensional reductions outside quasiclassical
approximations. Apart from hologarphic projections on null-surfaces, holograhic
relations between QFT in different spacetime dimensions violate the causal
completeness property, this includes in particular the Maldacena conjecture.
Last not least, modular localization sheds light onto unsolved problems from
QFT's distant past since it reveals that the Einstein-Jordan conundrum is
really an early harbinger of the Unruh effect.

we are dealing with the human lives here, we can not just rely on the
localization schemes that depend upon the connectivity information Rf i.e.
range-free algorithms only. Further, rescue operations are carried out in
highly noisy environments, so distance based Rb(range-based) localization
algorithms generate high error in distance measurements. An efficient algorithm
is needed that can measure the location of the sensor nodes near to the living
being or being attached to them in 3-D space with a high accuracy. To achieve
such kind of accuracy a combination of both the strategies is required. The
proposed method which incorporates both the Rb(range-based)&Rfrange-free
strategies that successfully localizes nodes in a sensor network with noisy
distance measurements. We also have depicted the effect of scalability on the
performance of the algorithm. Results show that as the scalability of the
network increases with the number of beacon nodes; the performance of the
algorithm goes high above 90 percent . The granularity of the areas estimated
may be easily adjusted by changing the system parameters which makes the
proposed algorithm flexible.

important roles in the dynamical and physical evolution of asteroids.
Thermophysical modelling of these observed effects, and of thermal-infrared
observations, allows a detailed physical characterisation of an individual
asteroid to be performed. We perform a detailed physical characterisation of
near-Earth asteroid (1620) Geographos, a potential meteor stream source and
former spacecraft target, using the same techniques as previously used in
Rozitis et al. (2013) for (1862) Apollo. We use the advanced thermophysical
model (ATPM) on published light-curve, radar, and thermal-infrared observations
to constrain the thermophysical properties of Geographos. The derived
properties are used to make detailed predictions of the Yarkovsky orbital drift
and YORP rotational acceleration, which are then compared against published
measurements to determine Geographos's bulk density. We find that Geographos
has a thermal inertia of 340 +140/-100 J m-2 K-1 s-1/2, a roughness fraction of
>50%, and a bulk density of 2100 +550/-450 kg m-3 when using the
light-curve-derived shape model with the radar-derived maximum equatorial
diameter of 5.04 +/- 0.07 km. It is also found that the radar observations had
overestimated the z-axis in Geographos's shape model because of their
near-equatorial view. This results in a poor fit to the thermal-infrared
observations if its effective diameter is kept fixed in the model fitting. The
thermal inertia derived for Geographos is slightly higher than the typical
values for a near-Earth asteroid of its size, and its derived bulk density
suggests a rubble-pile interior structure. Large uncertainties in shape model
z-axes are likely to explain why radar and thermal-infrared observations
sometimes give inconsistent diameter determinations for other asteroids.

period of the torsional oscillator. We report the results of a study in two
different torsional oscillators that were specially designed to minimize the

dynamics of a radical in which the electron spin is hyperfine coupled to a
large number of nuclear spins. This can be used to calculate the singlet and
triplet survival probabilities and quantum yields of radical recombination
reactions in the presence of magnetic fields. Our method differs from the early
semiclassical theory of Schulten and Wolynes [J. Chem. Phys. 68, 3292 (1978)]
in allowing each individual nuclear spin to precess around the electron spin,
rather than assuming that the hyperfine coupling-weighted sum of nuclear spin
vectors is fixed in space. The downside of removing this assumption is that one
can no longer obtain a simple closed-form expression for the electron spin
correlation tensor: our method requires a numerical calculation. However, the
computational effort increases only linearly with the number of nuclear spins,
rather than exponentially as in an exact quantum mechanical calculation. The
method is therefore applicable to arbitrarily large radicals. Moreover, it
approaches quantitative agreement with quantum mechanics as the number of
nuclear spins increases and the environment of the electron spin becomes more
complex, owing to the rapid quantum decoherence in complex systems. Unlike the
Schulten-Wolynes theory, the present semiclassical theory predicts the correct
long-time behaviour of the electron spin correlation tensor, and it therefore
correctly captures the low magnetic field effect in the singlet yield of a
radical recombination reaction with a slow recombination rate.

complementary to the study of their energy spectrum and chemical composition to
understand their origin and propagation. It is also a tool to probe the
structure of the magnetic fields through which cosmic rays travel. As cosmic
rays are mostly charged nuclei, their trajectories are deflected by the action
of galactic magnetic field they propagate through before reaching the Earth
atmosphere, so that their detection carries directional information only up to
distances as large as their gyro-radius. If cosmic rays below
$10^{15}{\rm\,eV}$ are considered and the local galactic magnetic field
($\sim3{\rm\,\mu G}$) is accounted for, gyro-radii are so short that isotropy
is expected. At most, a weak di-polar distribution may exist, reflecting the
contribution of the closest CR sources. However, a number of experiments
observed an energy-dependent \emph{""large scale""} anisotropy in the sidereal
time frame with an amplitude of about 10$^{-4}$ - 10$^{-3}$, revealing the
existence of two distinct broad regions: an excess distributed around
40$^{\circ}$ to 90$^{\circ}$ in Right Ascension (commonly referred to as
""tail.in"" excess) and a deficit (the ""loss cone"") around 150$^{\circ}$ to
240$^{\circ}$ in Right Ascension. In recent years the Milagro and ARGO-YBJ
collaborations reported the of a ""medium"" scale anisotropy inside the tail-in
region. The observation of such small features has been recently claimed by the
IceCube experiment also in the Southern hemisphere. So far, no theory of cosmic
rays in the Galaxy exists which is able to explain the origin of these
different anisotropies leaving the standard model of cosmic rays and that of

and the \textit{q}-deformed dimer state. However, these recursive formulas are
derived for a broader class of states and represent a concrete starting point
for the computation of rather general overlaps. Our approach can be easily
extended to other one-dimensional Bethe Ansatz integrable models.

Chromodynamics. In this thesis I apply hard-thermal-loop perturbation theory,
which is a gauge-invariant reorganization of the conventional perturbative
expansion for quantum gauge theories to study the thermodynamics of QCD in
leading-order, next-to-leading-order and next-to-next-to-leading order at
finite temperature and finite chemical potential. I also discuss about various
order diagonal and off-diagonal quark number susceptibilities in leading order
as well as beyond leading order. For all the observables, I compare our results
with available lattice QCD data and we find good agreement. Along with the
computation of thermodynamic quantities of hot and dense matter, I also discuss
about low mass dilepton rate from hot and dense medium using both perturbative
and non-perturbative models and compare them with those from lattice gauge
theory and in-medium hadron gas.

  Mass Accretion Rate in Close Binary Stars","Accepted for publication in The African Review of Physics with minor
  revisions",,,,"gr-qc astro-ph.SR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Mass transfer in close binaries is often non-conservative and the modeling of
this kind of mass transfer is mathematically challenging as in this case due to
the loss of mass as well as angular momentum the governing system gets
complicated and uncertain. In the present work a new mathematical model has
been prescribed for the non-conservative mass transfer in a close binary system
taking in to account the gradually decreasing profile of the mass accretion
rate by the accreting star with respect to time as well as with respect to the
increase in mass of the accreting star. The process of mass transfer is
understood to occur up to a critical mass limit of the accreting star beyond
which this process may cease to work.

Concept of Consciousness (QCC), based on the many-worlds interpretation of
quantum mechanics (Everett interpretation). Within QCC the phenomenon of
super-intuition is analyzed, which explains in particular the great scientific
insights and realizes a sort of a ""mental time machine"". The recently expressed
opinion that emergence of super-intuition requires transferring quantum
information, which is banned by the impossibility of ""quantum cloning"", is
critically considered. It is shown that in fact under QCC the emergence of the
phenomenon of super-intuition requires not transferring quantum information,
but only correlating various fragments of it. Actual examples of scientific
insights that have been documented by prominent scientists, suggest that the
marker of the correlation in this case is a strong positive emotion, which can
be called cognitive euphoria.

equilibrium between the gravitational field of the stars and their random
motion and rotation. In the vertical direction Kapteyn's results are
substantially correct. Usually the Kapteyn Universe is described as being
flawed due to neglect of interstellar absorption. Kapteyn was led to adopt this
on the basis of widely accepted evidence by Shapley on an absence of reddening
of stars in globular clusters. But another, equally important misconception was
Kapteyn's interpretation of the two Star Streams as manifestations of two
groups of stars rotating around a center in opposite directions. This was
supported by the observation of very different mixes in stellar types in the
two streams. Had Kapteyn adopted the absorption as he himself had determined it
he would not have been able to arrive at a consistent picture.

nanotube (CNT) reinforced face sheets are investigated using QUAD-8 shear
flexible element developed based on higher-order structural theory. The
formulation accounts for the realistic variation of the displacements through
the thickness, the possible discontinuity in the slope at the interface, and
the thickness stretch affecting the transverse deflection. The in-plane and
rotary inertia terms are also included in the formulation. The first-order high
Mach number approximation to linear potential flow theory is employed for
evaluating the aerodynamic pressure. The solutions of the complex eigenvalue
problem, developed based on Lagrange's equation of motion are obtained using
the standard method for finding the eigenvalues. The accuracy of the present
formulation is demonstrated considering the problems for which solutions are
available. A detailed numerical study is carried out to bring out the efficacy
of the higher-order model over the first-order theory and also to examine the
influence of the volume fraction of the CNT, core-to-face sheet thickness, the
plate thickness and the aspect ratio, damping and the temperature on the
flutter boundaries and the associated vibration modes.

nonvanishing chemical potential on an ultra-static space-time are studied. High
temperature regime, which is the relevant regime for the relativistic gas, is
studied through the heat kernel expansion for both Dirichlet and Neumann
boundary conditions. The high temperature expansion in the presence of a
chemical potential is generated via the Mellin transform methods as applied to
the harmonic sums representing the free energy and the depletion coefficient.
The effects of boundary conditions on the relation between depletion
coefficient and temperature are analyzed. The analysis is done for both charged
and neutral bosons.
