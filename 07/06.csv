previously studied FeAs-based compounds that magnetically order,
Ba$_{1-x}$Na$_x$Fe$_2$As$_2$ exhibits two successive magnetic transitions: For
x=0.35 upon cooling magnetic order occurs at $\sim$70\ K with in-plane magnetic
moments being arranged as in pure or Ni, Co and K-doped BaFe$_2$As$_2$ samples.
At a temperature of $\sim$46\ K a second phase transition occurs, which the
single-crystal neutron diffraction experiments can unambiguously identify as a
spin reorientation. At low temperatures, the ordered magnetic moments in
Ba$_{0.65}$Na$_{0.35}$Fe$_2$As$_2$ point along the $c$ direction. Magnetic
correlations in these materials cannot be considered as Ising like, and
spin-orbit coupling must be included in a quantitative theory.

parameters, wind velocity and mass-loss rate from the final thermal pulses
during the asymptotic giant branch (AGB) through to the post-AGB stage for a
range of initial stellar masses. The instabilities that form at the interface
between the hot bubble and the swept-up AGB wind shell lead to hydrodynamical
interactions, photoevaporation flows and opacity variations. We explore the
effects of hydrodynamical mixing combined with thermal conduction at this
interface on the dynamics, photoionization, and emissivity of our models. We
find that even models without thermal conduction mix significant amounts of
mass into the hot bubble. When thermal conduction is not included, hot gas can
leak through the gaps between clumps and filaments in the broken swept-up AGB
shell and this depressurises the bubble. The inclusion of thermal conduction
evaporates and heats material from the clumpy shell, which expands to seal the
gaps, preventing a loss in bubble pressure. The dynamics of bubbles without
conduction is dominated by the thermal pressure of the thick photoionized
shell, while for bubbles with thermal conduction it is dominated by the hot,
shocked wind.

the generator is the Laplace-Beltrami operator with respect to a geometry which
is influenced by the embedding geometry and the properties of the kernel. In
particular, this allows us to generate any Riemannian geometry by an
appropriate choice of local kernel. In this way, we continue a program of
Belkin, Niyogi, Coifman and others to reinterpret the current diverse
collection of kernel-based data analysis methods and place them in a geometric
framework. We show how to use this framework to design local kernels invariant
to various features of data. These data-driven local kernels can be used to
construct conformally invariant embeddings and reconstruct global

possibly different times, have to meet at the same node. This problem is known
as rendezvous. Agents move in synchronous rounds using a deterministic
algorithm. In each round, an agent decides to either remain idle or to move to
one of the adjacent nodes. Each agent has a distinct integer label from the set
$\{1,...,L\}$, which it can use in the execution of the algorithm, but it does
not know the label of the other agent.
  If $D$ is the distance between the initial positions of the agents, then
$\Omega(D)$ is an obvious lower bound on the time of rendezvous. However, if
each agent has no initial knowledge other than its label, time $O(D)$ is
usually impossible to achieve. We study the minimum amount of information that
has to be available a priori to the agents to achieve rendezvous in optimal
time $\Theta(D)$. This information is provided to the agents at the start by an
oracle knowing the entire instance of the problem, i.e., the network, the
starting positions of the agents, their wake-up rounds, and both of their
labels. The oracle helps the agents by providing them with the same binary
string called advice, which can be used by the agents during their navigation.
The length of this string is called the size of advice. Our goal is to find the
smallest size of advice which enables the agents to meet in time $\Theta(D)$.
We show that this optimal size of advice is $\Theta(D\log(n/D)+\log\log L)$.
The upper bound is proved by constructing an advice string of this size, and
providing a natural rendezvous algorithm using this advice that works in time
$\Theta(D)$ for all networks. The matching lower bound, which is the main
contribution of this paper, is proved by exhibiting classes of networks for
which it is impossible to achieve rendezvous in time $\Theta(D)$ with smaller
advice.

combination of gravitational settling and radiative levitation. Their presence,
nature and detailed structure can affect the excitation process of various
stellar pulsation modes, and must therefore be modeled carefully in order to
better interpret Kepler asteroseismic data. In this paper, we study the
interplay between atomic diffusion and fingering convection in A-type stars,
and its role in the establishment and evolution of iron accumulation layers. To
do so, we use a combination of three-dimensional idealized numerical
simulations of fingering convection, and one-dimensional realistic stellar
models. Using the three-dimensional simulations, we first validate the mixing
prescription for fingering convection recently proposed by Brown et al. (2013),
and identify what system parameters (total mass of iron, iron diffusivity,
thermal diffusivity, etc.) play a role in the overall evolution of the layer.
We then implement the Brown et al. (2013) prescription in the Toulouse-Geneva
Evolution code to study the evolution of the iron abundance profile beneath the
stellar surface. We find, as first discussed by Th\'eado et al. (2009), that
when the concurrent settling of helium is ignored, this accumulation rapidly
causes an inversion in the mean molecular weight profile, which then drives
fingering convection. The latter mixes iron with the surrounding material very
efficiently, and the resulting iron layer is very weak. However, taking helium
settling into account partially stabilizes the iron profile against fingering
convection, and a large iron overabundance can accumulate. The opacity also
increases significantly as a result, and in some cases ultimately triggers
dynamical convection.

clusters in turbulent molecular clouds. We show that infall rates in turbulent
clouds are comparable to accretion rates inferred from protostellar
luminosities or measured in pre-main-sequence stars. They should not be
neglected in modeling the luminosity of protostars and the evolution of disks,
even after the embedded protostellar phase. We find large variations of infall
rates from protostar to protostar, and large fluctuations during the evolution
of individuals protostars. In most cases, the infall rate is initially of order
10$^{-5}$\msun\ yr$^{-1}$, and may either decay rapidly in the formation of
low-mass stars, or remain relatively large when more massive stars are formed.
The simulation reproduces well the observed characteristic values and scatter
of protostellar luminosities and matches the observed protostellar luminosity
function. The luminosity problem is therefore solved once realistic
protostellar infall histories are accounted for, with no need for extreme
accretion episodes. These results are based on a simulation of randomly-driven
magneto-hydrodynamic turbulence on a scale of 4pc, including self-gravity,
adaptive-mesh refinement to a resolution of 50AU, and accreting sink particles.
The simulation yields a low star formation rate, consistent with the
observations, and a mass distribution of sink particles consistent with the
observed stellar initial mass function during the whole duration of the

rule is well obeyed below about 80 K, but clearly violated above 80 K.
Measurements of the Hall coefficient reveal a strong but non-monotonic
temperature dependence with a maximum at about 80 K, in contrast to any other
FeAs-based superconductors. With the two-band model analysis on the Hall
coefficient, we conclude that a gap may open below 65 K. The data above 65 K
are interpreted as a temperature induced crossover from a metallic state at a
low temperature to an orbital-selective Mott phase at a high temperature. This
is consistent with the recent data of angle resolved photoemission
spectroscopy. These results call for a refined theoretical understanding,
especially when the hole pockets are absent or become trivial in
K$_x$Fe$_{2-y}$Se$_2$ superconductors.

relativity solving the Einstein constraint equations, and its parameters
include a conformal class, a conformal momentum (as measured by a densitized
lapse), and a mean curvature. Although the conformal method is successful in
generating constant mean curvature (CMC) solutions of the constraint equations,
it is unknown how well it applies in the non-CMC setting, and there have been
indications that it encounters difficulties there. We are therefore motivated
to investigate alternative generalizations of the CMC conformal method.
  Introducing a densitized lapse into the ADM Lagrangian, we find that
solutions of the momentum constraint can be described in terms of three
parameters. The first is conformal momentum as it appears in the standard
conformal method. The second is volumetric momentum, which appears as an
explicit parameter in the CMC conformal method, but not in the non-CMC
formulation. We have called the third parameter drift momentum, and it is the
conjugate momentum to infinitesimal motions in superspace that preserve
conformal class and volume form up to independent diffeomorphisms. This
decomposition of solutions of the momentum constraint leads to extensions of
the CMC conformal method where conformal and volumetric momenta both appear as
parameters. There is more than one way to treat drift momentum, in part because
of an interesting duality that emerges, and we identify three candidates for
incorporating drift into a variation of the conformal method.

smooth interface self-intersects in finite time. By means of elementary
arguments, we prove that such a singularity cannot occur in finite time for
vortex sheet evolution, i.e. for the two-phase incompressible Euler equations.
We prove this by contradiction; we assume that a splash singularity does indeed
occur in finite time. Based on this assumption, we find precise blow-up rates
for the components of the velocity gradient which, in turn, allow us to
characterize the geometry of the evolving interface just prior to
self-intersection. The constraints on the geometry then lead to an impossible
outcome, showing that our assumption of a finite-time splash singularity was
false.

specific one, constitute a sizable portion of current and future electric
demand. This flexibility can be used to improve the performance of the grid,
should the right incentives be in place.
  In this paper, we consider the optimal decision making problem faced by a
flexible load, demanding a certain amount of energy over its availability
period, subject to rate constraints. The load is also capable of providing
Ancillary Services (AS) by decreasing or increasing its consumption in response
to signals from the Independent System Operator. Under arbitrarily distributed
and correlated Markovian energy and AS prices, we obtain the optimal policy for
minimizing expected total cost, which includes cost of energy and benefits from
AS provision, assuming no capacity reservation requirement for AS provision. We
also prove that the optimal policy has a multi-threshold form and can be
computed, stored and operated efficiently. We further study the effectiveness
of our proposed optimal policy and its impact on the grid.
  We show that, while optimal simultaneous consumption and AS provision under
real-time stochastic prices is achievable with acceptable computational burden,
the impact of adopting such real-time pricing schemes on the network might not
be as good as suggested by the majority of the existing literature. In fact, we
show that such price responsive loads are likely to induce peak-to-average
ratios much more than what is observed in the current distribution networks and
adversely affect the grid.

Hamiltonian, which has been encoded using the logical qubits of a single-qubit
error detecting code, coupled to an environment of qubits by interaction terms
that act one-locally on the system. Energy penalty terms are added that
penalize states outside of the codespace. We prove that in the limit of
infinitely large penalties, one-local errors are completely suppressed, and we
derive some bounds for the finite penalty case. Our proof technique involves
exact integration of the Schrodinger equation, making no use of master
equations or their assumptions. We perform long time numerical simulations on a
small (one logical qubit) computational system coupled to an environment and
the results suggest that the energy penalty method achieves even greater

the spatial scales of the wave-like disturbance modes, generated by

that the vertical ionospheric irregularities of 5-40km range observed in first

Mach cone ) from supersonic ground source - seismic wave to the heights up to

observed after 06:20UT were apparently linked with other mechanisms. It is
shown that the existing temporary CHIRP ionosonde temporal resolution (60

supervised hierarchical feature learning. The approach consists of two parts:
hierarchical feature learning and large-scale model learning. The hierarchical
feature learning searches feature in three levels of granularity in a
supervised way. First, face images are modeled by receptive field theory, and
the representation is an image with many channels of Gaussian receptive maps.
We activate a few most distinguish channels by supervised learning. Second, the
face image is further represented by patches of picked channels, and we search
from the over-complete patch pool to activate only those most discriminant
patches. Third, the feature descriptor of each patch is further projected to
lower dimension subspace with discriminant subspace analysis.
  Learned feature of activated patches are concatenated to get a full face
representation.A linear classifier is learned to separate face pairs from same
subjects and different subjects. As the number of face pairs are extremely
large, we introduce ADMM (alternative direction method of multipliers) to train
the linear classifier on a computing cluster. Experiments show that more
training samples will bring notable accuracy improvement.
  We conduct experiments on FRGC and LFW. Results show that the proposed
approach outperforms existing algorithms under the same protocol notably.
Besides, the proposed approach is small in memory footprint, and low in
computing cost, which makes it suitable for embedded applications.

not all packets have the same importance and not all devices are interested in

using the hybrid HSE06 functional. C$_{\mathrm{Cu}}$ acts as a shallow donor,
C$_{\mathrm{In}}$ and interstitial C yield deep donor levels in CuInSe$_{2}$,
while in CuGaSe$_{2}$ C$_{\mathrm{Ga}}$ and interstitial C act as deep
amphoteric defects. So, if present, these defects reduce the majority carrier

for the photogenerated minority carriers (electrons). However, the formation
energies of the calculated carbon impurities are high, even under C-rich growth

cascades. This motif may reduce cross-talk between signalling pathways, as the
second phosphorylation site allows for proofreading, especially when
phosphorylation is distributive rather than processive. Recent studies suggest
that phosphorylation can be `pseudo-processive' in the crowded cellular
environment, as rebinding after the first phosphorylation is enhanced by slow
diffusion. Here, we use a simple model with unsaturated reactants to show that
specificity for one substrate over another drops as rebinding increases and
pseudo-processive behavior becomes possible. However, this loss of specificity
with increased rebinding is typically also observed if two distinct enzyme
species are required for phosphorylation, i.e. when the system is necessarily
distributive. Thus the loss of specificity is due to an intrinsic reduction in
selectivity with increased rebinding, which benefits inefficient reactions,
rather than pseudo-processivity itself. We also show that proofreading can
remain effective when the intended signalling pathway exhibits high levels of
rebinding-induced pseudo-processivity, unlike other proposed advantages of the
dual phosphorylation motif.

integrable PDEs, presenting a \textit{unified} approach for them. The
classification includes such important examples as Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) and
evolutionary Non Linear Schr\"" odingier (ENLS) equations. In fact, employing
basic matrix algebra techniques it is shown that there are exactly two
canonical forms of such vessels, so that each canonical form generalize either
KdV or ENLS equations. Particularly, Dirac canonical systems, whose evolution
was recently inserted into the vessel theory, are shown to be equivalent to the
ENLS equation in the sense of vessels. This work is important as a first step
to classification of completely integrable PDEs, which are solvable by the
theory of vessels. We note that a recent paper of the author, published in
Journal of Mathematical Physics, showed that initial value problem with
analytic initial potential for the KdV equation has at least a ""narrowing"" in
time solution. The presented classification, inherits this idea and a similar
theorem can be easily proved for the presented PDEs. Finally, the the resuts of
the work serve as a basis for the investigation of the following problems: 1.
hierarchy of the generalized KdV, ENLS equations (by generalizing the vessel
equations), 2. new completely integrable PDEs (by changing the dimension of the
outer space), 3. addressing the question of integrability of a given arbitrary
PDE (the future classification will create a list of solvable by vessels
equations, which may eventually include many existing classes of PDEs).

  When the first part of each of the partitions is taken to be very large (the

Littlewood-Richardson coefficients, and have been studied quite extensively.
  In this paper, we show that reduced Kronecker coefficients appear naturally
as structure constants of the Deligne categories $\underline{Rep}(S_t)$. This

resemblance to MSPKmerCounter, yet replacing the original minimizers with

irrotational in a Galilean referential if it is true at the initial time. When
continuity of normal velocity and pressure are prescribed on the free surface,
we establish that the global coupled problem conserves an energy functional

solving Neumann problems for the Laplace operator in the fluid in order to
represent the rotational rigid motion with irrotational vector fields. Then we
have a good framework to consider the coupled problem between the fluid and the
rigid motion. The coupling between the free surface and the ad hoc component of
the velocity potential introduces a ""Neumann to Dirichlet"" operator that allows
to write the coupled system in a very compact form. The final expression of a

interaction cutoff distance. The dimensionality of shortest paths is calculated
as a function of interaction cutoff distance. Shortest paths are self similar
with a fractal dimension of 1.12 when calculated with step lengths larger than
6.8 {\AA}. Paths are multifractal below 6.8 {\AA}. The number of steps to
traverse a shortest path is a discontinuous function of cutoff size at short
cutoff values, showing abrupt decreases to smaller values as cutoff distance
increases. As information progresses along the direction of a shortest path a
large set of residues are affected because they are interacting neighbors to
the residues of the shortest path. Thus, several residues are involved
diffusively in information transport which may be identified with the present
model. An algorithm is introduced to determine the residues of a given shortest
path. The shortest path residues are the highly visited residues during
information transport. These paths are shown to lie on the high entropy
landscape of the protein where entropy is taken to increase with abundance of
visits to nodes during signal transport.
