antiferromagnet Cr doped with V has long been considered the reason that
neither new collective electronic states or even non Fermi liquid behaviour are
observed when antiferromagnetism in Cr$_{1-x}$V$_{x}$ is suppressed to zero
temperature. We present the results of neutron and electron diffraction
measurements of several lightly doped single crystals of Cr$_{1-x}$V$_{x}$ in
which the archtypal spin density wave instability is progressively suppressed
as the V content increases, freeing the nesting-prone Fermi surface for a new
striped charge instability that occurs at x$_{c}$=0.037. This novel nesting
driven instability relieves the entropy accumulation associated with the
suppression of the spin density wave and avoids the formation of a quantum
critical point by stabilising a new type of charge order at temperatures in
excess of 400 K. Restructuring of the Fermi surface near quantum critical
points is a feature found in materials as diverse as heavy fermions, high
temperature copper oxide superconductors and now even elemental metals such as
Cr.

$\Lambda$CDM and self-similar cosmologies. We show that the relation between
concentration, $c$, and peak height, $\nu$, exhibits the smallest deviations
from universality if halo masses are defined with respect to the critical
density of the universe. These deviations can be explained by the residual
dependence of concentration on the local slope of the matter power spectrum,
$n$, which affects both the normalization and shape of the $c$-$\nu$ relation.
In particular, there is no well-defined floor in the concentration values.
Instead, the minimum concentration depends on redshift: at fixed $\nu$, halos
at higher $z$ experience steeper slopes $n$, and thus have lower minimum
concentrations. We show that the concentrations in our simulations can be
accurately described by a universal seven-parameter function of only $\nu$ and
$n$. This model matches our $\Lambda$CDM results to $\lesssim 5\%$ accuracy up
to $z = 6$, and matches scale-free $\Omega_{\rm m} = 1$ models to $\lesssim
15\%$. The model also reproduces the low concentration values of Earth--mass
halos at $z \approx 30$, and thus correctly extrapolates over $16$ orders of
magnitude in halo mass. The predictions of our model differ significantly from
all models previously proposed in the literature at high masses and redshifts.
Our model is in excellent agreement with recent lensing measurements of cluster
concentrations.

of the perturbations affecting the warm H2 in the kinematics, morphology and
mass of the molecular gas. We analyzed the molecular gas mass derived from
CO(1-0), MH2, and its kinematics, and then compared it to the mass of the warm
molecular gas, the stellar mass and star formation rate (SFR). Our results are
the following. (i) The mass ratio between the CO-derived and the warm H2
molecular gas is in the same range as for field galaxies. (ii) Some galaxies,
mostly MOHEGs, have very broad CO linewidths of up to 1000 kms. The line shapes
are irregular and show various components. (iii) The mapped objects show
asymmetric distributions of the cold molecular gas. (iv) The star formation
efficiency (= SFR/MH2) of galaxies in HCGs is similar to isolated galaxies. No
significant difference between MOHEGs and non-MOHEGs or between early-types and
spirals has been found. (v) The molecular gas masses, MH2, and MH2/LK are lower
in MOHEGs (predominantly early-types) than in non-MOHEGs (predominantly
spirals). This trend remains when comparing MOHEGs and non-MOHEGs of the same
morphological type. The differences in the molecular gas properties of MOHEGs
support the view that they are suffering perturbations of the molecular gas, as
well as a decrease in the molecular gas content and associated SFR.

jet with the aim to investigate the robustness and accuracy of mean flow
stability wave models. The jet's axisymmetric mode is excited at the nozzle lip
through a sinusoidal modulation of the flow rate at amplitudes ranging from 0.1
% to 100 %. The instantaneous flow field is measured via particle image
velocimetry and decomposed into a mean and periodic part utilizing proper
orthogonal decomposition. Local linear stability analysis is applied to the
measured mean flow adopting a weakly nonparallel flow approach. The resulting
global perturbation field is carefully compared to the measurements in terms of
spatial growth rate, phase velocity, and phase and amplitude distribution. It
is shown that the stability wave model accurately predicts the excited flow
oscillations during their entire growth phase and during a large part of their
decay phase. The stability wave model applies over a wide range of forcing
amplitudes, showing no pronounced sensitivity to the strength of nonlinear
saturation. The upstream displacement of the neutral point and the successive
reduction of gain with increasing forcing amplitude is very well captured by
the stability wave model. At very strong forcing (>40%), the flow becomes
essentially stable to the axisymmetric mode. For these extreme cases, the
prediction deteriorates from the measurements due to an interaction of the
forced wave with the geometric confinement of the nozzle. Moreover, the model
fails far downstream in a region where energy is transferred from the
oscillation back to the mean flow. This study supports previously conducted
mean flow stability analysis of self-excited flow oscillations in the cylinder
wake and in the vortex breakdown bubble and extends the methodology to
externally forced convectively unstable flows.

techniques. Despite the spectral instability of many forms of the MRI, this
proves to be a natural method of analysis that is well-suited to deal with the
non-self-adjoint nature of the linear MRI equations. We find that the fastest
growing linear MRI structures on both local and global domains can look very
different to the eigenmodes, invariably resembling waves shearing with the
background flow (shear waves). In addition, such structures can grow many times
faster than the least stable eigenmode over long time periods, and be localized
in a completely different region of space. These ideas lead -- for both
axisymmetric and non-axisymmetric modes -- to a natural connection between the
global MRI and the local shearing box approximation. By illustrating that the
fastest growing global structure is well described by the ordinary differential
equations (ODEs) governing a single shear wave, we find that the shearing box
is a very sensible approximation for the linear MRI, contrary to many previous
claims. Since the shear wave ODEs are most naturally understood using nonmodal
analysis techniques, we conclude by analyzing local MRI growth over finite
time-scales using these methods. The strong growth over a wide range of
wave-numbers suggests that nonmodal linear physics could be of fundamental
importance in MRI turbulence.

prominent drifts of intensity maxima in the time-frequency plane that arise
from refractive effects. Our analysis suggests that the scattering screen is

frequency data from Parkes reveals a dramatic evolution of the pulse profile
with frequency, with the outer conal emission becoming comparable in strength
to that from the core and inner conal regions. As well as demonstrating high
time resolution science capabilities currently possible with the MWA, our

inherently weak interaction with the environment. Here we characterize the
properties of deeply subradiant molecular states with intrinsic quality factors

asymptotic behaviors. The first is radiative decay via weak magnetic-dipole and
electric-quadrupole interactions. We prove that its rate increases
quadratically with the bond length, confirming quantum mechanical predictions.
The second is nonradiative decay through weak gyroscopic predissociation, with
a rate proportional to the vibrational mode spacing and sensitive to
short-range physics. This work bridges the gap between atomic and molecular

galaxy surveys, we develop a general description of the probability
distribution function of galaxy pairwise velocities within the framework of the
so-called streaming model. For a given galaxy separation $\vec{r}$, such
function can be described as a superposition of virtually infinite local
distributions. We characterize these in terms of their moments and then
consider the specific case in which they are Gaussian functions, each with its
own mean $\mu$ and dispersion $\sigma$. Based on physical considerations, we
make the further crucial assumption that these two parameters are in turn
distributed according to a bivariate Gaussian, with its own mean and covariance
matrix. Tests using numerical simulations explicitly show that with this
compact description one can correctly model redshift-space distorsions on all
scales, fully capturing the overall linear and nonlinear dynamics of the galaxy
flow at different separations. In particular, we naturally obtain
Gaussian/exponential, skewed/unskewed distribution functions, depending on
separation as observed in simulations and data. Also, the recently proposed
single-Gaussian description of redshift-space distortions is included in this
model as a limiting case, when the bivariate Gaussian is collapsed to a
two-dimensional Dirac delta function. We also show how this description
naturally allows for the Taylor expansion of $1+\xi_S(\vec{s})$ around
$1+\xi_R(r)$, which leads to the Kaiser linear formula when truncated to second
order, expliciting its connection with the moments of the velocity distribution
functions. More work is needed, but these results indicate a very promising
path to make definitive progress in our program to improve RSD estimators.

finite fields in the multi-player message passing model, proving a number of
tight lower bounds. Specifically, for a matrix which is distributed among a
number of players, we consider the problem of determining its rank, of
computing entries in its inverse, and of solving linear equations. We also
consider related problems such as computing the generalized inner product of
vectors held on different servers. We give a general framework for reducing
these multi-player problems to their two-player counterparts, showing that the
randomized $s$-player communication complexity of these problems is at least
$s$ times the randomized two-player communication complexity. Provided the
problem has a certain amount of algebraic symmetry, which we formally define,
we can show the hardest input distribution is a symmetric distribution, and
therefore apply a recent multi-player lower bound technique of Phillips et al.
Further, we give new two-player lower bounds for a number of these problems. In
particular, our optimal lower bound for the two-player version of the matrix
rank problem resolves an open question of Sun and Wang.
  A common feature of our lower bounds is that they apply even to the special
""threshold promise"" versions of these problems, wherein the underlying
quantity, e.g., rank, is promised to be one of just two values, one on each
side of some critical threshold. These kinds of promise problems are
commonplace in the literature on data streaming as sources of hardness for
reductions giving space lower bounds.

special relativity (VSR). The low-energy regime is accessed and the
nonrelativistic Hamiltonian is obtained. It turns out that this Hamiltonian is
similar to that achieved from the Standard Model Extension (SME) via coupling
of the spinor field to a Lorentz-violating term, but new features arise
inherited from the non-local character of the VSR. In addition, the
implications of the VSR-modified Lorentz symmetry on the spectrum of a hydrogen
atom are determined by calculating the first-order energy corrections in the
context of standard quantum mechanics. Among the results, we highlight that the
modified Hamiltonian provides non-vanishing corrections which lift the
degeneracy of the energy levels and allow us to find an upper bound upon the
VSR-parameter.

maximum likelihood estimation (MLE), minimum Fisher information distance, and
Bayesian mean estimation (BME). We discuss the different prior densities in the
space of density matrices, on which both MLE and BME depend, as well as ways of
including experimental errors and of estimating tomography errors. As a measure
of the accuracy of these methods we average the trace distance between a given
density matrix and the tomographic density matrices it can give rise to through
experimental measurements. We find that the BME provides the most accurate
estimate of the density matrix, and suggest using either the pure-state prior,
if the system is known to be in a rather pure state, or the Bures prior if any
state is possible. The MLE is found to be slightly less accurate. We comment on
the extrapolation of these results to larger systems.

fundamental characteristic of this arrangement, the maximum cutwidth, for
assessing the quality of any priority planning strategy. Our theoretical
analysis validates the role of the maximum cutwidth by deriving bounds for the

We demonstrate that time-periodic modulation of the electronic structure by
electric fields can be used to reversibly control $J_\text{ex}$ on ultrafast
timescales in extended antiferromagnetic Mott insulators. In the regime of weak
driving strength, we find that $J_\text{ex}$ can be enhanced and reduced for

that this causes time reversal of the associated quantum spin dynamics. These
results suggest wide applications, not only to control magnetism in condensed

assess fundamental questions concerning the reversibility of the quantum

other systems with applications to non-smooth boundary value problems. In this
paper, we determine conditions under which such operators satisfy conical
square function estimates in a range of $L^p$ spaces, thus allowing us to apply
the theory of Hardy spaces associated with an operator, to prove that they have
a bounded holomorphic functional calculus in those $L^p$ spaces. We also obtain
functional calculi results for restrictions to certain subspaces, for a larger

perturbed Hodge Laplacians, generalising known Riesz transform bounds for an
elliptic operator $L$ with bounded measurable coefficients, one Sobolev
exponent below the Hodge exponent, and $L^p$ bounds on the square-root of $L$

cosmology it is assumed that a slowly rolling scalar field leads to an
exponential increase in the size of space. At the end of this phase, the scalar
field begins to oscillate and transfers its energy to regular matter. This
transfer typically involves a parametric resonance instability. This article
reviews work which the author has done in collaboration with Walter Craig

GaAs/AlGaAs heterostructures, with a 2DEG at typically 100 nm below the

macroscopic measurement leads at the surface. Here we report on designing and
measuring a dedicated device for unraveling the various resistance
contributions in such contacts, which include pristine 2DEG series resistance,
the 2DEG resistance under a contact, the contact resistance itself, and the
influence of pressing a bonding wire onto a contact. We also report here a
robust recipe for contacts with very low resistance, with values that do not
change significantly for annealing times between 20 and 350 sec, hence
providing the flexibility to use this method for materials with different 2DEG
depths. The type of heating used for annealing is found to strongly influence
the annealing process and hence the quality of the resulting contacts.

simply linear combination of states. The FCIQMC algorithm is able to find this
sub-linear scaling regime without bias and with only a choice of Hamiltonian
basis. By means of a demonstration we solve for the energy of a 70-site
half-filled system (with a space of $10^{38}$ determinants) in 250 core hours,
substantially quicker than the $\sim$10$^{36}$ core hours that would be
required by exact diagonalisation. This is the largest space that has been
sampled in an unbiased fashion. The challenge for the recently-developed FCIQMC
method is made clear: expand the sub-linear scaling regime whilst retaining
exact on average accuracy. This result rationalizes the success of the
initiator adaptation (i-FCIQMC) and offers clues to improve it. We argue that
our results changes the landscape for development of FCIQMC and related
methods.

for each sub-sample using a maximum-likelihood method that accounts for
possible contaminants. We show by constructing vertical Jeans models that the
different sub-samples yield consistent results only when we allow the velocity
ellipsoid in the disk to be tilted, demonstrating that the common assumption of
decoupled radial and vertical motions in the disk is incorrect. Further, we
obtain that the tilt of the velocity ellipsoid is consistent among the
different sub-samples. We find that increase in the tilt with height is well
described by the relation alpha_tilt = (-0.90 +- 0.04) arctan(|z|/R_sun) -
(0.01 +- 0.005), which is close to alignment with the spherical coordinate
system and hence a velocity ellipsoid pointing to the Galactic centre. We also
confirm earlier findings that the sub-samples behave almost isothermally with
both radial and vertical velocity dispersion approximately constant with
height. We conclude that the coupling between radial and vertical motion
captured in the velocity ellipsoid tilt cannot be ignored when considering

distribution of galaxy velocities must differ from that of the dark matter
inside haloes of $\sim 10^{13}$--$10^{14}h^{-1}{\rm M_{\odot}}$, i.e. the data
require the existence of galaxy velocity bias. Most notably, central galaxies
on average are not at rest with respect to the core of their host haloes
(defined by the inner 25% of particles around the halo potential minimum), but
rather move around it with a 1D velocity dispersion of $0.22^{+0.03}_{-0.04}$
times that of the dark matter, implying a spatial offset from the centre at the
level of $\lesssim$1% of the halo virial radius. The luminous satellite
galaxies move more slowly than the dark matter, with velocities
$0.86^{+0.08}_{-0.03}$ times those of the dark matter, which suggests that the
velocity and spatial distributions of these satellites cannot both be unbiased.
The constraints mainly arise from the Fingers-of-God effect at nonlinear scales

a series of controlled, comprehensive hydrodynamical simulations sampling
idealized galaxy merger scenarios constructed from model spiral galaxies.
Idealized and controlled simulations of this sort complement the more
'realistic' cosmological simulations by isolating and analyzing the effects of
specific parameters, as we do in this paper. We recreate minor and major binary
mergers, binary merger trees with multiple progenitors, and multiple sequential
mergers. Within each of these categories of formation history, we correlate
progenitor gas fraction, mass ratio, orbital pericenter, orbital ellipticity,
and spin with remnant kinematic properties. We create kinematic profiles of
these 95 simulations comparable to ATLAS^3D data. By constructing remnant
profiles of the projected specific angular momentum (lambda_R = <R|V|> /
<sqrt(V^2+sigma^2)>, triaxiality, and measuring the incidences of kinematic
twists and kinematically decoupled cores, we distinguish between varying
formation scenarios. We find that binary mergers nearly always form fast
rotators. Slow rotators can be formed from zero initial angular momentum
configurations and gas-poor mergers, but are not as round as the ATLAS^3D
galaxies. Remnants of binary merger trees are triaxial slow rotators.
Sequential mergers form round slow rotators that most resemble the ATLAS^3D
rotators.

We present an estimator for extracting the intrinsic alignment signal of
galaxies around stacked clusters of galaxies from multiband imaging data. Our
estimator removes the contamination caused by galaxies that are gravitationally
lensed by the clusters and scattered in redshift space due to photometric
redshift uncertainties. It uses posterior probability distributions for the
redshifts of the galaxies in the sample and it is easily extended to obtain the
weak gravitational lensing signal while removing the intrinsic alignment
contamination. We apply this algorithm to groups and clusters of galaxies
identified in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey `Stripe 82' coadded imaging data
over $\sim 150$ deg$^2$. We find that the intrinsic alignment signal around
stacked clusters in the redshift range $0.1<z<0.4$ is consistent with zero. In
terms of the tidal alignment model of Catelan et al. (2001), we set joint
constraints on the strength of the alignment and the bias of the lensing groups
and clusters on scales between 0.1 and $10\,h^{-1}$ Mpc, $b_LC_1\rho_{\rm crit}

alignment to lensing signal to the range between $[-18,23]$ per cent below
scales of 1 $h^{-1}$ Mpc at 95 per cent confidence level, and this result
depends on our photometric redshift quality and selection criteria used to
identify background galaxies. Our results are robust to the choice of
photometric band in which the shapes are measured ($i$ and $r$) and to centring
on the Brightest Cluster Galaxy or on the geometrical centre of the clusters.

with two-body interactions in the limit of strong perturbation. The Bessel
function, associated with the evolution under full random matrices, is obtained
with surprisingly sparse random matrices. The cosine squared behavior,
established by the energy-time uncertainty relation, is approached after a

in Calabi-Yau geometries. Having been used to construct perturbative
expansions, it was recently shown that they can also be extended past
perturbation theory by making use of resurgent transseries. These yield formal
nonperturbative solutions, showing integrability of the holomorphic anomaly
equations at the nonperturbative level. This paper takes such constructions one
step further by working out in great detail the specific example of topological
strings in the mirror of the local CP2 toric Calabi-Yau background, and by
addressing the associated (resurgent) large-order analysis of both perturbative
and multi-instanton sectors. In particular, analyzing the asymptotic growth of
the perturbative free energies, one finds contributions from three different
instanton actions related by Z_3 symmetry, alongside another action related to
the Kahler parameter. Resurgent transseries methods then compute, from the
extended holomorphic anomaly equations, higher instanton sectors and it is
shown that these precisely control the asymptotic behavior of the perturbative
free energies, as dictated by resurgence. The asymptotic large-order growth of
the one-instanton sector unveils the presence of resonance, i.e., each
instanton action is necessarily joined by its symmetric contribution. The
structure of different resurgence relations is extensively checked at the
numerical level, both in the holomorphic limit and in the general
nonholomorphic case, always showing excellent agreement with transseries data
computed out of the nonperturbative holomorphic anomaly equations. The
resurgence relations further imply that the string free energy displays an
intricate multi-branched Borel structure, and that resonance must be properly
taken into account in order to describe the full transseries solution.

  13-15, Boston, MA",,,,"q-bio.MN","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Biological network alignment identifies topologically and functionally
conserved regions between networks of different species. It encompasses two
algorithmic steps: node cost function (NCF), which measures similarities
between nodes in different networks, and alignment strategy (AS), which uses
these similarities to rapidly identify high-scoring alignments. Different
methods use both different NCFs and different ASs. Thus, it is unclear whether
the superiority of a method comes from its NCF, its AS, or both. We already
showed on MI-GRAAL and IsoRankN that combining NCF of one method and AS of
another method can lead to a new superior method. Here, we evaluate MI-GRAAL
against newer GHOST to potentially further improve alignment quality. Also, we
approach several important questions that have not been asked systematically
thus far. First, we ask how much of the node similarity information in NCF
should come from sequence data compared to topology data. Existing methods
determine this more-less arbitrarily, which could affect the resulting
alignment(s). Second, when topology is used in NCF, we ask how large the size
of the neighborhoods of the compared nodes should be. Existing methods assume
that larger neighborhood sizes are better.
  We find that MI-GRAAL's NCF is superior to GHOST's NCF, while the performance
of the methods' ASs is data-dependent. Thus, the combination of MI-GRAAL's NCF
and GHOST's AS could be a new superior method for certain data. Also, which
amount of sequence information is used within NCF does not affect alignment
quality, while the inclusion of topological information is crucial. Finally,
larger neighborhood sizes are preferred, but often, it is the second largest
size that is superior, and using this size would decrease computational
complexity.
  Together, our results give several general recommendations for a fair
evaluation of network alignment methods.

Below a critical value Uc for attractive interactions there is a Dirac
semimetal phase and above it there is a superconducting phase. We add scalar
potential disorder to the system, while remaining at charge neutrality on
average. Numerical solution of the BdG equations suggests that while in the
strong attraction regime (U > Uc) disorder has the usual effect of suppressing
superconductivity, in the weak attraction regime (U < Uc) weak disorder
enhances superconductivity. In the weak attraction regime, disorder that is too
strong eventually suppresses superconductivity, i.e., there is an optimal
disorder strength that maximizes the critical temperature Tc. Our numerical
results also suggest that in the weakly disordered regime, mesoscopic
inhomogeneities enhance superconductivity significantly more than what is
predicted by a spatially uniform mean-field theory a` la Abrikosov-Gorkov. In
this regime, superconductivity consists of rare phase-coherent superconducting
islands. We also study the enhancement of the superconducting proximity effect

$\lambda$, the triplet coupling to the two Higgs doublets, is smaller than 1.34
in absolute value. For $|\lambda|\gtrsim 0.8$ we show that the fine-tuning
associated to each viable data point can be greatly reduced as compared to
values attainable in MSSM. We also find that for perturbatively viable data
points it is possible to obtain either enhancement or suppression in
$h\rightarrow \gamma \gamma$ decay rate depending mostly on the relative sign
between $M_2$ and $\mu_D$. Finally, we perform a fit by taking into account 58
Higgs physics observables along with $\mathcal{B}r(B_s\to X_s \gamma)$, for

naturality prefers a large $|\lambda|$, the experimental data disfavors it

$\mathcal{B}r(B_s\to X_s \gamma)$. We notice, though, that this situation might

neutral fraction that are a factor of 3 or more beyond those expected from

driven by large-scale variations in the mean free path, consistent with
expectations for the final stages of inhomogeneous hydrogen reionization. Even
by $z \simeq 5.6$, however, a large fraction of the data are consistent with a

the reactive form of Burgers' equation. This serves as a simple analogue to the
reactive Euler equations, permitting one to gain insight into the nonlinear
dynamics of detonation waves. Chemical kinetics were modeled using a two-step
reaction with distinct induction and reaction zones. An evolution equation for
the detonation structure was derived using the method of matched asymptotics
for large activation energy and slow rate of energy release. While the first
order solution was found unconditionally unstable, the second order evolution
equation predicted both stable and unstable solutions. The neutral stability
boundary was found analytically, given by $\chi=4$, where $\chi$ is the product
of activation energy and the ratio of induction to reaction time. This
reproduces accurately what has been previously established for the reactive
Euler equations and verified experimentally. The evolution equation also
captures stable limit cycle oscillations in the unstable regime and offers
unique insight into the instability mechanism. The mechanism amplifying the
perturbations lies within the induction zone, where the Arrhenius-type rate
equation provides a large change in induction times for small perturbations.
The mechanism attenuating the perturbations arises from acoustic effects, which
delays the amplification of the shock front. The longer the detonation wave,
the more time it takes for the amplification from the reaction zone to reach
the shock front, creating gradients that counter-act the amplification from the
flame acceleration. The results agree with direct numerical simulation, as well
as recovering many similarities with the reactive Euler equation.

~4200 cm^-3. Our analysis adopting an isothermal cylinder model shows that the
filament is supported by the turbulent and magnetic pressures against the
radial and axial collapse due to self-gravity. Since both the dissipation time
scales of the turbulence and the transverse magnetic fields can be comparable
to the free-fall time of the filament gas of 10^6 years, we conclude that the
local decay of the supersonic turbulence made the filament gas locally
unstable, hence making the core collapse. Furthermore, we newly detected a gas
condensation with velocity width enhancement to ~0.3 pc south-west of the GF9-2

The intensity mapping approach measures the spatio-spectral fluctuations due to
line emission from all galaxies, including those below the individual detection
threshold. The technique provides 3-D measurements of galaxy clustering and
moments of the galaxy luminosity function. Furthermore, the linear portion of
the power spectrum can be used to measure the total line emission intensity
including all sources through cosmic time with redshift information naturally
encoded. Total line emission, when compared to the total star formation
activity and/or other line intensities reveals evolution of the interstellar
conditions of galaxies in aggregate. As a case study, we consider measurement
of [CII] autocorrelation in the 0.5 < z < 1.5 epoch, where interloper lines are
minimized, using far-IR/submm balloon-borne and future space-borne instruments
with moderate and high sensitivity, respectively. In this context, we compare
the intensity mapping approach to blind galaxy surveys based on individual
detections. We find that intensity mapping is nearly always the best way to
obtain the total line emission because blind, wide-field galaxy surveys lack
sufficient depth and deep pencil beams do not observe enough galaxies in the
requisite luminosity and redshift bins. Also, intensity mapping is often the
most efficient way to measure the power spectrum shape, depending on the

temperature can induce transitions between different structures, that are
accompanied by very large changes of equilibrium volumes. This fact has
stimulated extensive theoretical and experimental studies. In spite of this, a
convincing explanation of the metallurgic properties of Pu based on fundamental
principles is still lacking, and none of the previous theories has been able to
describe simultaneously the energetics and the $f$ electronic structure of all
of the phases of Pu on the same footing. Here we provide a bird's eye view of
Pu by studying the zero-temperature pressure-volume phase diagram and the $f$
electronic structure of all of its crystalline phases from first principles. In
particular, we clarify the way in which the $f$-electron correlations determine
its unusual energetics. Our theoretical energetics and ground-state $f$
electronic structure are both in good quantitative agreement with the
experiments.

precise cosmic ray spectrum and composition measurements up to the knee energy,
and high energy gamma-ray monitoring and survey. HERD is composed of a 3-D
cubic calorimeter (CALO) surrounded by microstrip silicon trackers (STKs) from
five sides except the bottom. CALO is made of about 10$^4$ cubes of LYSO
crystals, corresponding to about 55 radiation lengths and 3 nuclear interaction

sandwiched with tungsten converters to make precise directional measurements of
incoming electrons and gamma-rays. In the baseline design, each of the four
side SKTs is made of only three layers microstrips. All STKs will also be used
for measuring the charge and incoming directions of cosmic rays, as well as
identifying back scattered tracks. With this design, HERD can achieve the
following performance: energy resolution of 1\% for electrons and gamma-rays
beyond 100 GeV, 20\% for protons from 100 GeV to 1 PeV; electron/proton
separation power better than $10^{-5}$; effective geometrical factors of $>$3

to deal with affine distortions induced by viewpoint changes. Unlike the
traditional local descriptors such as SIFT, ASR inherently encodes local
information of multi-view patches, making it robust to affine distortions while
maintaining a high discriminative ability. To this end, PCA is used to
represent affine-warped patches as PCA-patch vectors for its compactness and
efficiency. Then according to the subspace assumption, which implies that the
PCA-patch vectors of various affine-warped patches of the same keypoint can be
represented by a low-dimensional linear subspace, the ASR descriptor is
obtained by using a simple subspace-to-point mapping. Such a linear subspace
representation could accurately capture the underlying information of a
keypoint (local structure) under multiple views without sacrificing its
distinctiveness. To accelerate the computation of ASR descriptor, a fast
approximate algorithm is proposed by moving the most computational part (ie,
warp patch under various affine transformations) to an offline training stage.
Experimental results show that ASR is not only better than the state-of-the-art
descriptors under various image transformations, but also performs well without
a dedicated affine invariant detector when dealing with viewpoint changes.

that the weak r-process occurs in supernovae with a progenitor mass range of

for their ecological benefits, with higher scalability and utilization for
local generation and delivery. PV can also potentially avoid the energy losses
that are normally associated with long-range grid distribution. The increased
penetration of solar panels, however, has introduced a need for solar energy
models that are capable of producing realistic synthetic data with small error
margins. Such models, for instance, can be used to design the appropriate size
of energy storage devices or to determine the maximum charging rate of a
PV-powered electric vehicle (EV) charging station. In this regard, this paper
proposes a stochastic model for solar generation using a Markov chain approach.
Based on real data, it is first shown that the solar states are
inter-dependent, and thus suitable for modeling using a Markov model. Then, the
probabilities of transition between states are shown to be heterogeneous over
different time segments. A model is proposed that captures the inter temporal
dependency of solar irradiance through segmentation of the Markov chain across
different times of the day. In the studied model, different state transition
matrices are constructed for different time segments, which the proposed
algorithm then uses to generate the solar states for different times of the
day. Numerical examples are provided to show the effectiveness of the proposed
synthetic generator.

Astronomers face the challenge of inspecting single large images, many similar

institutions have constructed TDWs on the basis that they will improve the
scientific outcomes of astronomical imagery. We test this concept by presenting
sample images to astronomers and non- astronomers using a standard desktop

experiments show that TDWs provide a better environment for searching for small

better at searching images for targets than non-astronomers, both groups are
generally better when employing physical navigation as opposed to virtual

the experience of a single astronomer. However, there is also a large

--- that is, for the same interaction strength --- and confirm that coherent
feedback is able to make much better use of the linear interaction than
measurement-based feedback. We find that this performance gap is caused not by
the back-action noise of the measurement but by the projection noise. We also
obtain simple expressions for the maximal cooling that can be obtained by both
methods in this regime, optimized over the interaction strength.

solution, the spacetime is asymptotically AdS (anti-de Sitter), where the

constant. The metric approaches the AdS spacetime in the asymptotic infinity
limit and precisely recovers the Schwarzschild-AdS solution in general

quasinormal frequency agrees with that of the Schwarzschild-AdS solution for
the tuned case. For other parameters, in the large black hole limit, as the

insensitive to the value of the cosmological constant. On the other hand, for a
small back hole the real part of the quasinormal frequency decreases as the

This paper presents a module and automated method for assessment and trends

more reasonable evaluation result, we take into consideration more high-quality
publications, the rank of each publication analyzed, and the different roles of
authors named on each paper in question. According to the 7638 papers published

is Mark Harman of the University College London, UK, the top-ranked institution
is the University of California, USA, and the top-ranked country is the USA.

a two-point function matrix for the radiation that consists of Hawking's

radiation matrix are not tracked, we show that it purifies only parametrically
close to the end of the BH evaporation and does so extremely fast. Our main
technical tool in the quantitative treatment of this purification is the purity
of the radiation matrix and, its inverse, the participation ratio. These can be
related to the Renyi entropy of the density matrix of the emitted radiation.

source of information for a better understanding of the impact of the autonomic
nervous system on the complexity of heart rate variability. Beat-to-beat heart
rate variability can be represented as a network of increments between
subsequent $RR$-intervals, which makes possible the visualization of short-term
heart period fluctuations. A network is constructed of vertices representing
increments between subsequent $RR$-intervals, and edges which connect adjacent
$RR$-increments. Two modes of visualization of such a network are proposed. The
method described is applied to nocturnal Holter signals recorded from healthy
young people and from cardiac transplant recipients. Additionally, the analysis
is performed on surrogate data: shuffled RR-intervals (to display short-range
dependence), and shuffled phases of the Fourier Transform of RR-intervals (to
filter out linear dependences). Important nonlinear properties of autonomic
nocturnal regulation in short-term variability in healthy young persons are
associated with $RR$-increments: accelerations and decelerations of a size
greater than about 35 ms. They reveal that large accelerations are more likely
antipersistent, while large decelerations are more likely persistent. Changes
in $RR$-increments in a heart deprived of autonomic supervision are much lower
than in a healthy individual, and appear to be maintained around a homeostatic
state, but there are indications that this dynamics is nonlinear. The method is
fruitful in the evaluation of the vagal activity - the quantity and quality of
the vagal tone - during the nocturnal rest of healthy young people. The method
also successfully extracts nonlinear effects related to intrinsic mechanisms of
the heart regulation.

bound for the isotropic XY chain with Fibonacci external magnetic field at
arbitrary coupling. It is anomalous in that the usual exponential decay in
$x-vt$ is replaced by exponential decay in $x-vt^\alpha$ with $0<\alpha<1$. In
fact, we can characterize the values of $\alpha$ for which such a bound holds
as those exceeding $\alpha_u^+$, the upper transport exponent of the one-body
Fibonacci Hamiltonian. Following the approach of \cite{HSS11}, we relate
Lieb-Robinson bounds to dynamical bounds for the one-body Hamiltonian
corresponding to the XY chain via the Jordan-Wigner transformation; in our case
the one-body Hamiltonian with Fibonacci potential. We can bound its dynamics by
adapting techniques developed in \cite{DT07, DT08, D05, DGY} to our purposes.
  We also explain why our method does not extend to yield anomalous
Lieb-Robinson bounds of power-law type for the random dimer model.

atom--atom interactions that one can observe intriguing many-body dynamics

excitation picture is applied to uniquely express the many-body state uniquely
in terms of correlated atom clusters within the normal component alone.
Implicit notation formalism is developed to {\it explicitly} derive the quantum
kinetics of {\it all} atom clusters. The clusters are shown to build up
sequentially, from smaller to larger ones, which is utilized to
nonperturbatively describe the interacting BEC with as few clusters as
possible. This yields the hyperbolic Bloch equations (HBEs) that not only
generalize the Hartree-Fock Bogoliubov approach but also are analogous to the
semiconductor Bloch equations (SBEs). This connection is utilized to apply
sophisticated many-body techniques of semiconductor quantum optics to BEC
investigations. Here, the HBEs are implemented to determine how a strongly
interacting Bose gas reacts to a fast switching from weak to strong
interactions, often referred to as unitarity. The computations for $^{35}$Rb
demonstrate that molecular states (dimers) depend on atom density, and that the
many-body interactions create coherent transients on a 100$\mu$s time scale

compute large one-dimensional non-LTE radiative transfer grids (using RADEX) by
using first only the CO transitions, and then all the available molecules in
order to constrain the densities, temperatures and column densities within the
CND. We finally present a preliminary set of chemical models to determine the
origin of the gas. We find that in general the gas in the CND is very dense (>
10^5 cm^-3) and hot (T> 150K), with differences especially in the temperature
across the CND. The AGN position has the lowest CO/HCO+, CO/HCN and CO/CS

differentiation across the CND. We also find differences between the chemistry
of the SB ring and some regions of the CND; the SB ring is also much colder and
less dense than the CND. Chemical modelling does not succeed in reproducing all
the molecular ratios with one model per region, suggesting the presence of

renormalization, enjoying growing attention for more than a decade by now. As
most available literature is concerned with the minimal subtraction scheme, we
like to point out properties of the kinematic subtraction scheme which is also
widely used in physics (under the names of MOM or BPHZ).
  In particular we relate renormalized Feynman rules $\phi_R$ in this scheme to
the universal property of the Hopf algebra $H_R$ of rooted trees, exhibiting a
refined renormalization group equation which is equivalent to $\phi_R: H_R
\rightarrow K[x]$ being a morphism of Hopf algebras to the polynomials in one
indeterminate.
  Upon introduction of analytic regularization this results in efficient
combinatorial recursions to calculate $\phi_R$ in terms of the Mellin
transform. We find that different Feynman rules are related by a distinguished
class of Hopf algebra automorphisms of $H_R$ that arise naturally from
Hochschild cohomology.
  Also we recall the known results for the minimal subtraction scheme and shed
light on the interrelationship of both schemes.
  Finally we incorporate combinatorial Dyson-Schwinger equations to study the
effects of renormalization on the physical meaningful correlation functions.
This yields a precise formulation of the equivalence of the two different
renormalization prescriptions mentioned before and allows for non-perturbative
definitions of quantum field theories in special cases.

networks (OSNs). Companies may provide incentives (e.g., via free samples of a
product) to a small group of users in an OSN, and these users provide
recommendations to their friends, which eventually increases the overall sales
of a given product. Nevertheless, this also opens a door for ""malicious
behaviors"": dishonest users may intentionally give misleading recommendations
to their friends so as to distort the normal sales distribution. In this paper,
we propose a detection framework to identify dishonest users in OSNs. In
particular, we present a set of fully distributed and randomized algorithms,
and also quantify the performance of the algorithms by deriving probability of
false positive, probability of false negative, and the distribution of number
of detection rounds. Extensive simulations are also carried out to illustrate
the impact of misleading recommendations and the effectiveness of our detection
algorithms. The methodology we present here will enhance the security level of
viral marketing in OSNs.

the proximity of the dSph optical center might be due to the emission from a DM
cuspy profile. No evidence for an extended emission over a size of few arcmin

on the WIMP parameter space for different annihilation/decay final states and
for different astrophysical assumptions. If the confinement of electrons and
positrons in the dSph is such that the majority of their power is radiated
within the dSph region, we obtain constraints on the WIMP annihilation rate
which are well below the thermal value for masses up to few TeV. On the other
hand, for conservative assumptions on the dSph magnetic properties, the bounds

dimensionally reducing an action for massless particles. For the latter we take
a model with a SO(N) extended local supersymmetry on the worldline, that is
known to describe massless (conformal) particles of higher spins in flat
spacetimes of even dimensions. Dimensional reduction produces an action for
massive spinning particles in odd dimensions. The field equations that emerge
in a quantization a la Dirac are shown to be equivalent to the Fierz-Pauli
ones. The massless limit generates a multiplet of massless states with higher
spins, whose first quantized field equations have a geometric form with fields
belonging to various types of Young tableaux. These geometric equations can be
partially integrated to show their equivalence with the standard
Fronsdal-Labastida equations. We covariantize our model to check whether an
extension to curved spacetimes can be achieved. Restricting to (A)dS spaces, we
find that the worldline gauge algebra becomes nonlinear, but remains first
class. This guarantees consistency on such backgrounds. A light cone analysis
confirms the presence of the expected propagating degrees of freedom. A
covariant analysis is worked out explicitly for the massive case, which is seen
to give rise to the Fierz-Pauli equations extended to (A)dS spaces. It is worth
noting that in D=3 the massless limit of our model when N goes to infinity has
the same field content of the Vasiliev's theory that accommodates each spin

accretion/wind activity by using our high-resolution optical spectra and
$U$-band photometry. We also characterize the disk properties of GW Ori by
modeling its spectral energy distribution (SED). By comparing our data to the
synthetical spectra, we classify GW Ori as a G8 star. Based on the RVs derived
from the spectra, we confirm the previous result as a close companion in GW Ori
with a period of ~242 days and an orbital semi-major axis of ~1 AU. The RV
residuals after the subtraction of the orbital solution with the equivalent
widths of accretion-related emission lines vary with periods of 5-6.7 days
during short time intervals, which are caused by the rotational modulation. The
H$\alpha$ and H$\beta$ line profiles of GW Ori can be decomposed in two
central-peaked emission components and one blue-shifted absorption component.
The absorption components are due to a disk wind modulated by the orbital
motion of the close companion. Therefore, the systems like GW Ori can be used
to study the extent of disk winds. We find that the accretion rates of GW Ori
are rather constant but can occasionally be enhanced by a factor of 2-3. We
reproduce the SED of GW Ori by using disk models with gaps ~25-55 AU in size. A
small population of tiny dust particles within the gap produces the excess
emission at near-infrared bands and the strong and sharp silicate feature at 10
$\mu$m. The SED of GW Ori exhibits dramatic changes on timescales of ~20 yr in
the near-infrared bands, which can be explained as the change in the amount and
distribution of small dust grains in the gap. We collect a sample of
binary/multiple systems with disks in the literature and find a strong positive
correlation between their gap sizes and separations from the primaries to
companions, which is generally consistent with the prediction from the theory.

electromagnetic perturbations exist. Particularly rich information can be
obtained from measuring the properties of electrons emitted in the course of
the excitation dynamics. Such an analysis of electron signals covers total
ionization, Photo-Electron Spectra, Photoelectron Angular Distributions, and
ideally combined PES/PAD, with a long history in molecular physics, also
increasingly used in cluster physics. Recent progress in the design of new
light sources (high intensity and/or frequency, ultra short pulses) opens new
possibilities for measurements and thus has renewed the interest on the
analysis of dynamical scenarios through these observables, well beyond a simple
access to a density of states. This, in turn, has motivated many theoretical
investigations of the dynamics of electronic emission for molecules and
clusters. A theoretical tool of choice is here Time-Dependent Density
Functional Theory (TDDFT) propagated in real time and on a spatial grid, and
augmented by a Self-Interaction Correction. This provides a pertinent, robust,
and efficient description of electronic emission including the detailed pattern
of PES and PAD. A direct comparison between experiments and well founded
elaborate microscopic theories is thus readily possible, at variance with more
demanding observables such as for example fragmentation or dissociation cross
sections. The aim of this paper is to review the available experimental results
motivating such studies, describe the theoretical tools developed on the basis
of real-time and real-space TDDFT to address in a realistic manner the analysis
of electronic emission following irradiation of clusters and molecules by
various laser pulses, discuss representative results, and finally give some
future directions of investigations.

initially propagate in the interior of the progenitor star. Because of the
subsequent loss of their external pressure support after they cross the stellar
surface, these flows can be modeled as moving around a corner. A strong
steady-state rarefaction wave is formed, and the sideways expansion is
accompanied by a rarefaction acceleration. We investigate the efficiency and
the general characteristics of this mechanism by integrating the steady-state,
special relativistic, magnetohydrodynamic equations, using a special set of
partial exact solutions in planar geometry (r self-similar with respect to the
""corner""). We also derive analytical approximate scalings in the
ultrarelativistic cold/magnetized, and hydrodynamic limits. The mechanism is
more effective in magnetized than in purely hydrodynamic flows. It
substantially increases the Lorentz factor without much affecting the opening
of the jet; the resulting values of their product can be much grater than
unity, allowing for possible breaks in the afterglow light curves. These
findings are similar to the ones from numerical simulations of axisymmetric
jets by Komissarov et al and Tchekhovskoy et al, although in our approach we
describe the rarefaction as a steady-state simple wave and self-consistently
calculate the opening of the jet that corresponds to zero external pressure.

As a side effect, we will prove that our algorithm runs in time

significant correlation between the shape of the infrared and X-ray light
curves, or between the size of the X-ray and infrared variability. Among the
stars with an X-ray flare none showed evidence of a correlated change in the
infrared photometry on timescales of days to weeks following the flare. This
lack of connection implies that X-ray heating of the planet forming region of
the disk is not significant, although we cannot rule out rapid or instantaneous
changes in infrared emission.

whole electromagnetic spectrum for most of the galaxies. We identify the
different dynamical substructures composing the Virgo cluster and we calculate
the local density of galaxies using different methods. We then study the
distribution of galaxies belonging to the red sequence, the green valley, and
the blue cloud within the different cluster substructures. Our analysis
indicates that all the most massive galaxies are slow rotators and are the
dominant galaxies of the different cluster substructures generally associated
with a diffuse X-ray emission. They are probably the result of major merging
events that occurred at early epochs. Slow rotators of lower stellar mass are
also preferentially located within the different high-density substructures of
the cluster. They are virialised within the cluster, thus Virgo members since
its formation. They have been shaped by gravitational perturbations occurring
within the infalling groups that later formed the cluster. On the contrary,
low-mass star-forming systems are extremely rare in the inner regions of the
Virgo cluster A, where the density of the intergalactic medium is at its
maximum. Our ram pressure stripping models consistently indicate that these
star-forming systems can be rapidly deprived of their interstellar medium
during their interaction with the intergalactic medium. The lack of gas
quenches their star formation activity transforming them into quiescent dwarf
ellipticals. This mild transformation does not perturb the kinematic properties
of these galaxies which still have rotation curves typical of star-forming
systems.

  format to share all information about a modeling project","3 figures, 1 table",,,,"cs.DL q-bio.MN","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Background: With the ever increasing use of computational models in the
biosciences, the need to share models and reproduce the results of published
studies efficiently and easily is becoming more important. To this end, various
standards have been proposed that can be used to describe models, simulations,
data or other essential information in a consistent fashion. These constitute
various separate components required to reproduce a given published scientific
result.
  Results: We describe the Open Modeling EXchange format (OMEX). Together with
the use of other standard formats from the Computational Modeling in Biology
Network (COMBINE), OMEX is the basis of the COMBINE Archive, a single file that
supports the exchange of all the information necessary for a modeling and
simulation experiment in biology. An OMEX file is a ZIP container that includes
a manifest file, listing the content of the archive, an optional metadata file
adding information about the archive and its content, and the files describing
the model. The content of a COMBINE Archive consists of files encoded in
COMBINE standards whenever possible, but may include additional files defined
by an Internet Media Type. Several tools that support the COMBINE Archive are
available, either as independent libraries or embedded in modeling software.
  Conclusions: The COMBINE Archive facilitates the reproduction of modeling and
simulation experiments in biology by embedding all the relevant information in
one file. Having all the information stored and exchanged at once also helps in
building activity logs and audit trails. We anticipate that the COMBINE Archive
will become a significant help for modellers, as the domain moves to larger,
more complex experiments such as multi-scale models of organs, digital
organisms, and bioengineering.

The makeup of the merging population does not change since z = 0.2. Major
mergers and dry mergers appear comparatively unimportant in the buildup of the
red sequence over the past 2 Gyr. We compare the colour, morphology,
environmental density and degree of activity of galaxies in pairs to those of

both redder and slightly more spheroid-dominated. This may be due to
""harassment"" in multiple previous passes prior to the current interaction.
Galaxy pairs do not appear to prefer significantly denser environments. There
is no evidence of an enhancement in the AGN fraction in pairs, compared to
other galaxies in the same volume.

many-body wave function and the initial state of the system. Our results for
the asymptotic scaling of local second-order correlations with increasing

Rays Theory (VRT) as a viable representation of nature, and to elaborate some
of its consequences. In 1846 Faraday introduced the concept of vibrating rays,
in which an atom is conceived as having rays that extend to infinity and move
with it. According to this point of view, electromagnetic radiative phenomena
correspond to vibration of these rays, which propagate at speed c relative to
the rays (and the atom). Although a discussion on this subject might seem to be
out-of-date, there are many reasons that justified this debate. The first
reason is based on the fact that the constancy of the speed of light,
irrespective of the source movement, has not been demonstrated experimentally
in a conclusive way. In fact, only ballistic emission theories can be discarded
by the experimental results. The second reason is based on the fact that study
of radiometric data from spacecrafts indicates the existence of different kinds
of anomalous Doppler residuals. We will show that these anomalies exhibit a
signature of Vibrating Rays Theory. The third reason is related to the time
definition in a rotating frame. According to SRT there is not a unique way to
assign a time, whereas under VRT no contradictions are present. And finally,
that a properly stated Vibrating Rays Theory is compatible with all known
experiments on electromagnetism and light propagation. In the present work we
will (1) explain how VRT should be interpreted, and why past experiments were
misinterpreted, (2) show the characteristics of VRT that are present in
spacecraft anomalies, (3) give a possible theoretical model (including the
possible presence of longitudinal waves), and (4) describe results in an
ongoing experiment designed to distinguish between VRT and SRT models.

responsivity dlog f_line/dlog f_cont to continuum variations in the context of
straw-man BLR geometries of varying size with fixed BLR boundaries, and for
which the intrinsic emission-line responsivity is known a priori. We find for a
generic emission-line that the measured responsivity, delay and maximum of the
cross-correlation function are correlated for characteristic continuum
variability timescales T_char less than the maximum delay for that line
tau_max(line) for a particular choice of BLR geometry and observer orientation.
The above correlations are manifestations of geometric dilution arising from
reverberation effects within the spatially extended BLR. When present,
geometric dilution reduces the measured responsivity, delay and maximum of the
cross-correlation function. We also find that the measured responsivity and
delay show a strong dependence on light-curve duration, with shorter campaigns
resulting in smaller than expected values, and only a weak dependence on
sampling rate.
  The observed strong negative correlation between continuum level and line
responsivity found in previous studies cannot be explained by differences in
the sampling pattern, light-curve duration or in terms of purely geometrical
effects. To explain this and to satisfy the observed positive correlation
between continuum luminosity and BLR size in an individual source, the
responsivity-weighted radius must increase with increasing continuum
luminosity. For a BLR with fixed inner and outer boundaries this requires
radial surface emissivity distributions which deviate significantly from a
simple power-law, and in such a way that the intrinsic emission-line
responsivity increases toward larger BLR radii, in line with photoionisation
calculations.

base such that the fibres are of dimension $\le 1$, and the pushforward of the
structure sheaf on $X$ is the structure sheaf on the base. In this situation
there is a particular tilting bundle on $X$ constructed by Van den Bergh, and
our result allows us to reconstruct $X$ as a quiver GIT quotient for an easy to
describe stability condition and dimension vector.
  This result applies to flips and flops in the minimal model program, and in
the situation of flops shows that both a variety and its flop appear as quiver
GIT moduli spaces for algebras produced from different tilting bundles on the
variety. We also give an application to rational surface singularities, showing
that their minimal resolutions can always be constructed as quiver GIT
quotients for specific dimension vectors and stability conditions. This gives a
construction of minimal resolutions as moduli spaces for all rational surface
singularities, generalising the $G$-Hilbert scheme moduli space construction
which exists only for quotient singularities.

Landau level of a two-dimensional electron system (2DES), residing in the

impurities results in a giant Zeeman splitting leading to an unusual ordering
of composite fermion Landau levels. In experiment, this results in an
unconventional opening and closing of fractional gaps around filling factor v =
3/2 as a function of an in-plane magnetic field, i.e. of the Zeeman energy. By
including the s-d exchange energy into the composite Landau level spectrum the
opening and closing of the gap at filling factor 5/3 can be modeled
quantitatively. The widely tunable spin-splitting in a diluted magnetic 2DES
provides a novel means to manipulate fractional states.

many ways, depending on how the environment is monitored, yielding different
sorts of conditioned states, evolving stochastically. In the case of ideal
monitoring these states are pure, and the set of states for a given monitoring
forms a basis (which is overcomplete in general) for the system. It has been
argued elsewhere [D. Atkins et al., Europhys. Lett. 69, 163 (2005)] that the
`pointer basis' as introduced by Zurek and Paz [Phys. Rev. Lett 70,
1187(1993)], should be identified with the unravelling-induced basis which
decoheres most slowly. Here we show the applicability of this concept of
pointer basis to the problem of state stabilization for quantum systems. In
particular we prove that for linear Gaussian quantum systems, if the feedback
control is assumed to be strong compared to the decoherence of the pointer
basis, then the system can be stabilized in one of the pointer basis states
with a fidelity close to one (the infidelity varies inversely with the control
strength). Moreover, if the aim of the feedback is to maximize the fidelity of
the unconditioned system state with a pure state that is one of its conditioned
states, then the optimal unravelling for stabilizing the system in this way is
that which induces the pointer basis for the conditioned states. We illustrate
these results with a model system: quantum Brownian motion. We show that even
if the feedback control strength is comparable to the decoherence, the optimal
unravelling still induces a basis very close to the pointer basis. However if
the feedback control is weak compared to the decoherence, this is not the case.

mechanics often appeared in the literature. For classical two-body mean field

energy of Curie-Weiss type magnetic models and the Hamilton-Jacobi action for a
one dimensional mechanical system. Similarly, the partition function plays the
role of the wave function in quantum mechanics and satisfies the heat equation
that plays, in this context, the role of the Schrodinger equation in quantum
mechanics. We show that this identification can be remarkably extended to
include a wide family of magnetic models classified by normal forms of suitable
real algebraic dispersion curves. In all these cases, the model turns out to be
completely solvable as the free energy as well as the order parameter are
obtained as solutions of an integrable nonlinear PDE of Hamilton-Jacobi type.
We observe that the mechanical analog of these models can be viewed as the
relativistic analog of the Curie-Weiss model and this helps to clarify the
connection between generalised self-averaging and in statistical thermodynamics
and the semi-classical dynamics of viscous conservation laws.

iteration paradigm. Indeed, it requires to study, as a milestone, a refinement

uniqueness of adapted solution to a general BSRE was initially proposed by the
French mathematician J. M. Bismut (1976, 1978). It had been solved by the

stochastic flow for the associated stochastic Hamiltonian system. The present

away linear momentum anisotropically, resulting in a gravitational recoil, or
""kick"", of the center of mass. For certain merger configurations the time
evolution of the magnitude of the kick velocity has a local maximum followed by
a sudden drop. Perturbative studies of this ""antikick"" in a limited range of
black hole spins have found that the antikick decreases for retrograde orbits
as a function of negative spin. We analyze this problem using a recently
developed code to evolve gravitational perturbations from a point-particle in
Kerr spacetime driven by an effective-one-body resummed radiation reaction
force at linear order in the mass ratio $\nu\ll 1$. Extending previous studies
to nearly-extremal negative spins, we find that the well-known decrease of the
antikick is overturned and, instead of approaching zero, the antikick increases
again to reach $\Delta v/(c\nu^{2})=3.37\times10^{-3}$ for dimensionless spin
$\hat{a}=-0.9999$. The corresponding final kick velocity is
$v_{end}/(c\nu^{2})=0.076$. This result is connected to the nonadiabatic
character of the emission of linear momentum during the plunge. We interpret it
analytically by means of the quality factor of the flux to capture
quantitatively the main properties of the kick velocity. The use of such
quality factor of the flux does not require trajectories nor horizon curvature
distributions and should therefore be useful both in perturbation theory and
numerical relativity.

microchannels are sampled over finite volumes within which the velocity fields

often to be only qualitative in nature, blind to velocity magnitudes. In the
pursuit of quantitatively useful results, one has treated the effects of the
finite volume as errors that must be corrected by means of ever more
complicated processing techniques. Resulting measurements have limited
robustness and require convoluted efforts to understand measurement
uncertainties. To increase the simplicity and utility of $\mu$PIV measurements,
we introduce a straightforward method, based directly on measurement, by which
one can determine the size and shape of the volume over which moving fluids are
sampled. By comparing measurements with simulation, we verify that this method
enables quantitative measurement of velocity profiles across entire channels,
as well as an understanding of experimental uncertainties. We show how the
method permits measurement of an unknown flow rate through a channel of known
geometry. We demonstrate the method to be robust against common sources of
experimental uncertainty. We also apply the theory to model the technique of
Scanning $\mu$PIV, which is often used to locate the center of a channel, and
we show how and why it can in fact misidentify the center. The results have
general implications for research and development that requires reliable,

multi-tenant operations is considered. It is concluded that the proposed QoEaaB
can bring a new perspective in QoE modeling and assessment toward a more
enriched approach to improving the experience based on innovation and deep
connectivity among actors.

(partially) transformed into light. It may occur by means of many or just one
bubble of gas inside a liquid medium, giving rise to the terms multi-bubble-
and single-bubble sonoluminescence (MBSL and SBSL). In the last years some
models have been proposed to explain this phenomenon, but there is still no
complete theory for the light emission mechanism (especially in the case of
SBSL). In this work, we will not address this more complicated particular
issue, but only present a simple model describing the dynamical behaviour of
the sonoluminescent bubble, in the SBSL case. Using simple numerical techniques
within the software Matlab, we discuss solutions considering various
possibilities for some of the parameters involved: liquid compressibility,
superficial tension, viscosity, and type of gas. The model may be used as an
introductory study of sonoluminescence in physics courses at undergraduate or
graduate levels, as well as a quite clarifying example of a physical system
exhibiting large nonlinearity.

collapse and revival) for light beams propagating in an inhomogeneous linear
medium are demonstrated using exact analytical solutions of wave equation. It
is shown that the coherent superposition of macroscopically distinguishable
states is generated via mode interference from an initial off-axis single
wave-packet. Squeezed cat states with a fidelity > 99% arise periodically and
disappear rapidly within limited intervals of a propagation distance. Collapse
and revival of wave packets at long-term non-paraxial evolution due to mode
interference is demonstrated. Oscillations of the beam trajectory with
extremely small amplitude of the order of 10-19 m which is typical of the
estimated displacement caused by cosmic gravitational waves in gravity-wave
detectors occur.

of the regulatory approach for the EU proposed DEMO device shows that the
purpose of the source can be changed from lifetime equivalent irradiation
exposure to data generation at lower levels of exposure by adopting a defence
in depth strategy and regular component surveillance. This reduces the
specification of the source with respect to IFMIF allowing lower risk
technology solutions to be considered. A description of such a source, the
Facility for Fusion Neutron Irradiation Research, FAFNIR, is presented here

plot of scale factor versus lookback time from the usual Hubble diagram of
modulus data against redshift. This is the first plot of this type. We follow
the model-independent methodology of Daly and Djorgovski (2004) used for their
radio-galaxy data. Once the data plot is completed, any model can be applied
and will display accordingly as described in standard literature. We then
compile an extensive data set to z = 1.8 by combining SNe Ia data from SNLS3 of
Conley et al. (2011), High-z SNe data of Riess et al. (2004) and radio-galaxy
data of Daly & Djorgovski (2004) to be used to validate the new plot. We first
display these data on a standard Hubble diagram to confirm the best fit for
LCDM cosmology and thus validate the joined data set. The scale factor plot is
then developed from the data and the LCDM model is again displayed from a
least-squares fit. The fit parameters are in agreement with the Hubble diagram
fit confirming the validity of the new plot. Of special interest is the
transition-time of the universe which in the scale factor plot will appear as
an inflection point in the data set. Noise is more visible on this presentation
which is particularly sensitive to inflection points of any model displayed on
the plot unlike on a modulus-z diagram where there are no inflection points and
the transition-z is not at all obvious by inspection. We obtain a lower limit
of z >0.6. It is evident from this presentation that there is a dearth of SNe
data in the range, z = 1-2, exactly the range necessary to confirm a LCDM
transition-z in the neighborhood of z = 0.76.
