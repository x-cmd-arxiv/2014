measure then the investor's optimal strategy can only be to invest in the
riskless asset (i.e. the no-regret strategy). Secondly, if the factor process

transmission of the occulter as a sum of basis functions. For each element of
the basis, we numerically computed the Fresnel diffraction at the aperture of
the telescope and the complex amplitude at its focus. The basis functions are
circular disks that are linearly apodized over a few centimeters (truncated
cones). We complemented the numerical calculation of the Fresnel diffraction
for these functions by a comparison with pure circular discs (cylinder) for
which an analytical expression, based on a decomposition in Lommel series, is
available. The technique of deriving the optimal transmission for a given
spectral bandwidth is a classical regularized quadratic minimization of
intensities, but linear optimizations can be used as well. Minimizing the
integrated intensity on the aperture of the telescope or for selected regions
of the focal plane leads to slightly different transmissions for the occulter.
For the focal plane optimization, the resulting residual intensity is
concentrated behind the geometrical image of the occulter, in a blind region
for the observation of an exoplanet, and the level of background residual
starlight becomes very low outside this image. Finally, we provide a tolerance
analysis for the alignment of the occulter to the telescope which also favors
the focal plane optimization.This means that telescope offsets of a few

owe their origin to the interaction between a bright resonance and a dark
(i.e., sub-radiant) narrower resonance, and may emerge in the optical
properties of planar two-dimensional (2D) periodic arrays (metasurfaces) of
plasmonic nanoparticles. In this Letter, we provide a thorough assessment of
their nature for the general case of normal and oblique plane wave incidence,
highlighting when a Fano resonance is affected by the mutual coupling in an
array and its capability to support free modal solutions. We analyze the
representative case of a metasurface of plasmonic nanoshells at ultraviolet
frequencies and compute its absorption under TE- and TM-polarized, oblique
plane-wave incidence. In particular, we find that plasmonic metasurfaces
display two distinct types of resonances observable as absorption peaks: one is
related to the Mie, dipolar resonance of each nanoparticle; the other is due to
the forced excitation of free modes with small attenuation constant, usually
found at oblique incidence. The latter is thus an array-induced collective Fano
resonance. This realization opens up to manifold flexible designs at optical
frequencies mixing individual and collective resonances. We explain the
physical origin of such Fano resonances using the modal analysis, which allows
to calculate the free modes with complex wavenumber supported by the
metasurface. We define equivalent array dipolar polarizabilities that are
directly related to the absorption physics at oblique incidence and show a
direct dependence between array modal phase and attenuation constant and Fano
resonances. We thus provide a more complete picture of Fano resonances that may
lead to the design of filters, energy-harvesting devices, photodetectors, and
sensors at ultraviolet frequencies.

where t is the cosmic time coinciding with the proper time of the Hubble

vicinity of a world line of a Hubble observer with the help of a special
conformal transformation. The local inertial metric is Minkowski flat and is
materialized by the congruence of time-like geodesics of static observers being
at rest with respect to the local spatial coordinates x^i. We consider geodesic
motion of test particles and notice that the local coordinate time x^0=x^0(t)
taken as a parameter along the world line of particle, is a function of the
Hubble's observer time t. This function changes smoothly from x^0=t for a
particle at rest (observer's clock), to x^0=t+1/2 Ht^2 for photons, where H is
the Hubble constant. Thus, motion of a test particle is non-uniform when its
world line is parametrized by time t. NASA JPL Orbit Determination Program
presumes that motion of light (after the Shapiro delay is excluded) is uniform
with respect to the time t but it does not comply with the non-uniform motion
of light on cosmological manifold. For this reason, the motion of light in the
solar system analysed with the Orbit Determination Program appears as having a

high-precision narrow-angle astrometry and phase-referenced interferometric
imaging. The laser metrology system of GRAVITY is at the heart of its
astrometric mode, which must measure the distance of 2 stars with a precision
of 10 micro-arcseconds. This means the metrology has to measure the optical
path difference between the two beam combiners of GRAVITY to a level of 5 nm.
The metrology design presents some non-common paths that have consequently to
be stable at a level of 1 nm. Otherwise they would impact the performance of
GRAVITY. The various tests we made in the past on the prototype give us hints
on the components responsible for this error, and on their respective
contribution to the total error. It is however difficult to assess their exact
origin from only OPD measurements, and therefore, to propose a solution to this
problem. In this paper, we present the results of a semi-empirical modeling of
the fibered metrology system, relying on theoretical basis, as well as on
characterisations of key components. The modeling of the metrology system
regarding various effects, e.g., temperature, waveguide heating or mechanical
stress, will help us to understand how the metrology behave. The goals of this
modeling are to 1) model the test set-ups and reproduce the measurements (as a
validation of the modeling), 2) determine the origin of the non-common path

Polish groupoids with essentially treeable orbit equivalence relation,
functorial Borel complexity coincides with the Borel complexity of the
associated orbit equivalence relation. On the other hand for every countable
equivalence relation $E$ that is not treeable there are Polish groupoids with
different functorial Borel complexity both having $E$ as orbit equivalence
relation. In order to obtain such a conclusion we generalize some fundamental
results about the descriptive set theory of Polish group actions to actions of
Polish groupoids, answering a question of Arlan Ramsay. These include the
Becker-Kechris results on Polishability of Borel $% G $-spaces, existence of
universal Borel $G$-spaces, and characterization of Borel $G$-spaces with Borel

increasingly important as meta data of many types, often assembled in
hierarchies, are constructed and combined for further biological analyses.
Statistical inaccuracy of meta data at any level may propagate to downstream
analyses, undermining the validity of scientific conclusions thus drawn. From
the perspective of mass spectrometry based proteomics, even though accurate
statistics for peptide identification can now be achieved, accurate protein
level statistics remain challenging.
  Results: We have constructed a protein ID method that combines peptide
evidences of a candidate protein based on a rigorous formula derived earlier;
in this formula the database $P$-value of every peptide is weighted, prior to
the final combination, according to the number of proteins it maps to. We have
also shown that this protein ID method provides accurate protein level
$E$-value, eliminating the need of using empirical post-processing methods for
type-I error control. Using a known protein mixture, we find that this protein
ID method, when combined with the Soric formula, yields accurate values for the
proportion of false discoveries. In terms of retrieval efficacy, the results
from our method are comparable with other methods tested.

novel coarse-grained Voronoi method to minimise size bias in measuring local
volume fraction, along with a variety of spatial correlation functions which
detect fractionation without requiring a clear distinction between the phases.
These can be applied whether or not a system is phase separated, to determine
structural correlations in particle size, and generalise easily to other kinds
of polydispersity (charge, shape, etc.). We measure fractionation in both mean
size and polydispersity between the phases, its direction differing between
model interaction potentials which are identical in the monodisperse case.
These qualitative features are predicted by a perturbative theory requiring
only a monodisperse reference as input. The results show that intricate
fractionation takes place almost from the start of phase separation, so can
play a role even in nonequilibrium arrested states. The methods for
characterisation of inhomogeneous polydisperse systems could in principle be
applied to experiment as well as modelling.

varies from $\geq 1.55$ $ns^{-1}$ close to the slow-light band edge to $\leq
0.25$ $ns^{-1}$ within the two-dimensional photonic bandgap. We measure an
average Purcell-factor of $\sim 2\times$ for dots randomly distributed within
the waveguide and maximum values of $\beta\sim 90 \%$ close to the slow light
band edge. Spatially resolved measurements performed by exciting dots at a well
controlled distance $0-45$ {\mu}m from the waveguide facet highlight the impact
of disorder on the slow-light dispersion. Although disorder broadens the
spectral width of the slow light region of the waveguide dispersion from
$\delta E_{d}\leq 0.5$ meV to $>6$ meV, we find that emission is nevertheless
primarily directed into propagating waveguide modes. The ability to control the

establish the existence of optimal solutions for the obtained nonconvex

exerted by myosin motors on scaffolds of actin filaments. Although individual
motors locally exert both contractile and extensile forces, large actomyosin
structures at the cellular scale are overwhelmingly contractile, suggesting
that the scaffold serves to favor contraction over extension. While this
mechanism is well understood in highly organized striated muscle, its origin in
disordered networks such as the cell cortex is unknown. Here we develop a
mathematical model of the actin scaffold's local two- or three-dimensional
mechanics and identify four competing contraction mechanisms. We predict that
one mechanism dominates, whereby local deformations of the actin break the
balance between contraction and extension. In this mechanism, contractile
forces result mostly from motors plucking the filaments transversely rather
than buckling them longitudinally. These findings sheds light on recent
$\textit{in vitro}$ experiments, and provides a new geometrical understanding
of contractility in the myriad of disordered actomyosin systems found
$\textit{in vivo}$.

this method, subject-specific functional profiles are first estimated, and the

able to identify promising genomic regions. Further, GIFT is likely to work
with multiple different types of experiments since different smoothing

to be generated by a resonance with a fundamental sectoral normal mode with

do not appear to generate strong waves. We also identify five waves with
pattern speeds between 807 degrees/day and 834 degrees/day. Since these pattern
speeds are close to the planet's rotation rate, they probably are due to
persistent gravitational anomalies within the planet. These waves are all found
in regions of enhanced optical depth known as plateaux, but surprisingly the
surface mass densities they yield are comparable to the surface mass densities
of the background C ring. Finally, one wave appears to be a one-armed spiral
pattern whose rotation rate suggests it is generated by a resonance with a
structure inside Saturn, but the nature of this perturbing structure remains
unclear. Strangely, the resonant radius for this wave seems to be drifting
inwards at an average rate of 0.8 km/year over the last thirty years, implying
that the relevant planetary oscillation frequency has been steadily increasing.

particle immersed boundary method (PIBM) for simulating the fluid-particle

exchange-based immersed boundary method (IBM) by treating each Lagrangian point
as a solid particle. This treatment enables LBM to be coupled with fine
particles residing within a particular grid cell. Compared with the
conventional IBM, dozens of times speedup in two-dimensional simulation and
hundreds of times in three-dimensional simulation can be expected under the
same particle and mesh number. Numerical simulations of particle sedimentation
in the Newtonian flows were conducted based on a combined lattice Boltzmann
method - particle immersed boundary method - discrete element method scheme,
showing that the PIBM can capture the feature of particulate flows in fluid and
is indeed a promising scheme for the solution of the fluid-particle interaction
problems.

satellites and red centrals both show stronger alignments than their blue

most of them stay in the inner region of the dark matter halo where the shape
of the CG better traces the dark matter distribution. The dependence of
alignment on the color of CGs arises from the halo mass dependence, since the
alignment between the shape of the central stellar component and the inner halo
increases with halo mass. We also find that the alignment of satellites is most
strongly dependent on their metallicity, suggesting that the metallicity of
satellites, rather than color, is a better tracer of galaxy alignment on small
scales. This could be tested in future observational studies.

stage of the earliest onset of collimated bipolar outflows during the
post-Asymptotic Giant Branch phase. They thus play a crucial role in the study
of the formation of bipolar Planetary Nebulae (PNe). To date, 14 water fountain
nebulae have been identified. The identification of more sources in this unique
stage of stellar evolution will enable us to study the origin of bipolar PNe
morphologies in more detail. We present the results of seven sources observed
with the JVLA that were identified as water fountain candidates in an
Effelsberg 100m telescope survey of 74 AGB and early post-AGB stars. We find
that our sample of water fountain candidates displays strong variability in
their 22 GHz H2O maser spectra. The JVLA observations show an extended bipolar
H2O maser outflow for one source, the OH/IR star IRAS 18455+0448. This source
was previously classified as a 'dying' OH/IR star based on the exponential
decrease of its 1612 MHz OH maser and the lack of H2O masers. We therefore also
re-observed the 1612, 1665, and 1667 MHz OH masers. We confirm that the 1612
MHz masers have not reappeared and find that the 1665/1667 MHz masers have
decreased in strength by several orders of magnitude during the last decade.
The OH/IR star IRAS 18455+0448 is confirmed to be a new addition to the class
of water fountain nebulae. Its kinematic age is approximately 70 yr, but could
be lower, depending on the distance and inclination. Previous observations
indicate, with significant uncertainty, that IRAS 18455+0448 has a surprisingly
low mass compared to available estimates for other water fountain nebulae. The
available historical OH maser observations make IRAS 18455+0448 unique for the
study of water fountain nebulae and the launch of post-AGB bipolar outflows...

peculiarities, such as initially weak helium features and low expansion
velocities with a nearly flat evolution, place this object in the small family
of events previously identified as transitional Type Ib/c supernovae (SNe).
There is ubiquitous evidence of hydrogen, albeit weak, in this family of SNe,
indicating that they are in fact a peculiar kind of Type IIb SNe that we name
""flat-velocity Type IIb"". The flat velocity evolution---which occurs at
different levels between 6000 and 8000 km/s for different SNe---suggests the
presence of a dense shell in the ejecta. Despite the spectroscopic
similarities, these objects show surprisingly diverse luminosities. We discuss
the possible physical or geometrical unification picture for such diversity.
Using archival HST images we associate SN 2010as with a massive cluster and
derive a progenitor age of ~6 Myr, assuming a single star-formation burst,
which is compatible with a Wolf-Rayet progenitor. Our hydrodynamical modelling,
on the contrary, indicates the pre-explosion mass was relatively low, of ~4
M_sol. The seeming contradiction between an young age and low pre-SN mass may
be solved by a massive interacting binary progenitor.

Common User Bolometer Array 2 (SCUBA-2) Cosmology Legacy Survey (S2CLS) in the
United Kingdom Infrared Deep Sky Survey Ultra Deep Survey (UKIDSS-UDS) field.
We employ a stacking technique to probe beneath the survey limit to measure the
average 850um flux density of LBGs at z=3, 4, and 5 with typical ultraviolet
luminosities of L(1700A)~10^29 erg/s/Hz. We measure 850um flux densities of
(0.25 +/- 0.03, (0.41 +/- 0.06), and (0.88 +/- 0.23) mJy respectively, and find
that they contribute at most 20 per cent to the cosmic far-infrared background
at 850um. Fitting an appropriate range of spectral energy distributions to the
z=3, 4, and 5 LBG stacked 24-850um fluxes, we derive infrared (IR) luminosities
of L(8-1000um)~3.2, 5.5, and 11.0x10^11 Lsun (corresponding to star formation
rates of ~50-200 Msun/yr) respectively. We find that the evolution in the IR
luminosity density of LBGs is broadly consistent with model predictions for the
expected contribution of luminous IR galaxy (LIRG) to ultraluminous IR galaxy
(ULIRG) type systems at these epochs. We also see a strong positive correlation
between stellar mass and IR luminosity. Our data are consistent with the main
sequence of star formation showing little or no evolution from z=3 to 5. We
have also confirmed that, for a fixed mass, the reddest LBGs (UV slope Beta ->
0) are indeed redder due to dust extinction, with SFR(IR)/SFR(UV) increasing by
approximately an order of magnitude over -2<Beta<0 such that SFR(IR)/SFR(UV)~20
for the reddest LBGs. Furthermore, the most massive LBGs also tend to have
higher obscured-to-unobscured ratio, hinting at a variation in the obscuration
properties across the mass range.

ETGs have EW(H$\rm \alpha$)$>6.0$ \AA. For the LTGs, 95% of them show uniform

magnetic support. When data within 1 pc of the filament centre is fitted with a
Gaussian function, the average FWHM is ~0.3 pc, in agreement with predictions
for accreting filaments. However, if the fit is constructed using only the
inner regions, as in Herschel observations, the resulting FWHM is only ~0.2 pc.
This value is larger than that measured in IC 5146 and Taurus, but is similar
to that found in the Planck Galactic Cold Cores and in Cygnus X. The simulated
filaments have a range of widths rather than a constant value. When the column
density maps are compared to the 3D gas densities, the filaments seen in column

network of short ribbon-like sub-filaments reminiscent of those seen in Taurus.
The sub-filaments are pre-existing within the simulated clouds, have radii
similar to their Jeans radius, and are not primarily formed through
fragmentation of the larger filament seen in column density. Instead, small
filamentary clumps are swept together into a single column density structure by
the large-scale collapse of the cloud.

energies through the mechanism of diffusive shock acceleration (DSA). Except
for direct plasma simulations, all modeling efforts must rely on a given form
of the diffusion coefficient, a key parameter that embodies the interactions of
energetic charged particles with the magnetic turbulence. The so-called Bohm
limit is commonly employed. In this paper we revisit the question of
acceleration at perpendicular shocks, by employing a realistic model of
perpendicular diffusion. Our coefficient reduces to a power-law in momentum for
low momenta (of index $\alpha$), but becomes independent of the particle
momentum at high momenta (reaching a constant value $\kappa_{\infty}$ above
some characteristic momentum $p_{\rm c}$). We first provide simple analytical
expressions of the maximum momentum that can be reached at a given time with
this coefficient. Then we perform time-dependent numerical simulations to
investigate the shape of the particle distribution that can be obtained when
the particle pressure back-reacts on the flow. We observe that, for a given
index $\alpha$ and injection level, the shock modifications are similar for
different possible values of $p_{\rm c}$, whereas the particle spectra differ
markedly. Of particular interest, low values of $p_{\rm c}$ tend to remove the
concavity once thought to be typical of non-linear DSA, and result in steep
spectra, as required by recent high-energy observations of Galactic SNRs.

(referred to as ""Massive MIMO"") is one of the most promising approaches to cope
with the predicted wireless data traffic explosion. In combination with Time
Division Duplex and with simple per-cell processing, it achieves large
throughput per cell, low latency, and attractive power efficiency performance.
Following the current wireless technology trend of moving to higher frequency
bands and denser small cell deployments, a large number of antennas can be
implemented within a small form factor even in small cell base stations. In a
heterogeneous network formed by large (macro) and small cell BSs, a key system
optimization problem consists of ""load balancing"", that is, associating users
to BSs in order to avoid congested hot-spots and/or under-utilized
infrastructure. In this paper, we consider the user-BS association problem for
a massive MIMO heterogeneous network. We formulate the problem as a network
utility maximization, and provide a centralized solution in terms of the
fraction of transmission resources (time-frequency slots) over which each user
is served by a given BS. Furthermore, we show that such a solution is
physically realizable, i.e., there exists a sequence of integer scheduling
configurations realizing (by time-sharing) the optimal fractions. While this
solution is optimal, it requires centralized computation. Then, we also
consider decentralized user-centric schemes, formulated as non-cooperative
games where each user makes individual selfish association decisions based only
on its local information. We identify a class of schemes such that their Nash
equilibrium is very close to the global centralized optimum. Hence, these
user-centric algorithms are attractive not only for their simplicity and fully
decentralized implementation, but also because they operate near the system
""social"" optimum.

dispersion $\xi(\mathbf{k}) = k_x^2 - k_y^2 - \mu$ in two dimensions within a
renormalization group approach. This energy dispersion exhibits a
neck-narrowing Lifshitz transition at the critical chemical potential $\mu_c=0$
where a van Hove singularity develops. Implementing a systematic
renormalization group analysis of this system has long been hampered by the
appearance of nonlocal terms in the Wilsonian effective action. We demonstrate
that non-locality at the critical point is intrinsic, and the locality of the
effective action can be maintained only away from the critical point. We also
point out that it is crucial to introduce a large momentum cutoff to keep
locality even away from the critical point. Based on a local renormalization
group scheme employed near the critical point, we show that, as the energy
scale $E$ is lowered, an attractive four-fermion interaction grows as $\log^2
E$ for $E > \mu$, whereas it retains the usual BCS growth, $-\log E$, for $E <
\mu$. Starting away from the critical point, this fast growth of the pairing
interaction suggests that the system becomes unstable toward a superconducting
state well before the critical point is reached.

Anomalous X-ray Pulsars (AXPs) and Soft Gamma-ray Repeaters (SGRs) are
clustered in the range 2-12 s. We explore a possibility to answer this question
assuming that AXPs and SGRs are the descendants of High Mass X-ray Binaries
(HMXBs) which have been disintegrated in the core-collapse supernova explosion.
The spin period of neutron stars in HMXBs evolves towards the equilibrium
period, averaging around a few seconds. After the explosion of its massive
companion, the neutron star turns out to be embedded into a dense gaseous
envelope, the accretion from which leads to the formation of a residual
magnetically-levitating (ML) disk. We show that the expected mass of a disk in
this case is 10^-7 - 10^-8 M_sun which is sufficient to maintain the process of
accretion at the rate 10^14 - 10^15 g/s over a time span of a few thousand
years. During this period the star manifests itself as an isolated X-ray pulsar
with a number of parameters resembling those of AXPs and SGRs. Period
clustering of such pulsars can be provided if the lifetime of the residual disk
does not exceed the spin-down timescale of the neutron star.

These remarkable formulas allow to clearly expose the super-conformal, dual

integrability it was recently shown that the building blocks of the amplitudes
permit a natural multi-parameter deformation. However, this approach had been
criticized by the observation that it seemed impossible to reassemble the
building blocks into Yangian-invariant deformed non-MHV amplitudes. In this
note we demonstrate that the deformations may be succinctly summarized by a
simple modification of the measure of the Grassmannian integrals, leading to a
Yangian-invariant deformation of the general tree-level amplitudes.
Interestingly, the deformed building-blocks appear as residues of poles in the
spectral parameter planes. Given that the contour integrals also contain
information on the amplitudes at loop-level, we expect the deformations to be
useful there as well. In particular, applying meromorphicity arguments, they
may be expected to regulate all notorious infrared divergences. We also point
out relations to Gelfand hypergeometric functions and the quantum
Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov equations.

threshold samples (absolute r-band magnitudes of -18 up to -21) that are
constructed from the subset of SDSS that has been spectroscopically observed
more than once (the so-called plate overlap region). We choose to measure
angular clustering in this reduced survey footprint in order to minimize the
effects of fiber collision incompleteness, which are otherwise substantial on
these small scales. We model our clustering measurements using a fully
numerical halo model that populates dark matter halos in N-body simulations to
create realistic mock galaxy catalogs. The model has free parameters that
specify both the number and spatial distribution of galaxies within their host
halos. We adopt a flexible density profile for the spatial distribution of
satellite galaxies that is similar to the dark matter Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW)
profile, except that the inner slope is allowed to vary. We find that the
angular clustering of our most luminous samples (Mr< -20 and -21) suggests that
luminous satellite galaxies have substantially steeper inner density profiles

consistent with satellite galaxies having shallow density profiles. Our results

imaging multi-mode interference from leaky modes along a highly multimode
tapered optical fiber, resulting in spectrally distinguishable images that form
a basis for reconstructing an incident light spectrum. This tapered fiber
multimode interference spectrometer enables the acquisition of broadband
spectra in a single camera exposure with a measured resolution of 40 pm in the
visible spectrum and 10 pm in the infrared spectrum, which are comparable to
the performance of grating spectrometers. Spectroscopy from 500 nm to 1600 nm
is demonstrated, though operation across the entire transparency window of
silica fibers is possible. Multimode interference spectroscopy of leaky modes
is suitable in a variety of device geometries, including planar waveguides in a

important problem appearing in many parallel applications. By modeling the
operations and their interactions as a graph, one can identify the independent
operations by solving a graph coloring problem. Many efficient sequential
algorithms are known for this NP-Complete problem, but they are typically
unsuitable when the operations and their interactions are distributed in the
memory of large parallel computers. On top of an existing distributed-memory
graph coloring algorithm, we investigate two compatible techniques in this
paper for fast and scalable distributed-memory graph coloring. First, we
introduce an improvement for the distributed post-processing operation, called
recoloring, which drastically improves the number of colors. We propose a novel
and efficient communication scheme for recoloring which enables it to scale
gracefully. Recoloring must be seeded with an existing coloring of the graph.
Our second contribution is to introduce a randomized color selection strategy
for initial coloring which quickly produces solutions of modest quality. We
extensively evaluate the impact of our new techniques on existing distributed
algorithms and show the time-quality tradeoffs. We show that combining an
initial randomized coloring with multiple recoloring iterations yields better
quality solutions with the smaller runtime at large scale.

and their use in specific applications will increase in the near future. The
ability to conduct meaningful comparisons and assessments will be crucial to
successful deployment and increasing biometric adoption. The best modality used
as unimodal biometric systems are unable to fully address the problem of higher
recognition rate. Multimodal biometric systems are able to mitigate some of the
limitations encountered in unimodal biometric systems, such as
non-universality, distinctiveness, non-acceptability, noisy sensor data, spoof
attacks, and performance. More reliable recognition accuracy and performance
are achievable as different modalities were being combined together and
different algorithms or techniques were being used. The work presented in this
paper focuses on a bimodal biometric system using face and fingerprint. An
image enhancement technique (histogram equalization) is used to enhance the
face and fingerprint images. Salient features of the face and fingerprint were
extracted using the Gabor filter technique. A dimensionality reduction
technique was carried out on both images extracted features using a principal
component analysis technique. A feature level fusion algorithm (Mahalanobis
distance technique) is used to combine each unimodal feature together. The
performance of the proposed approach is validated and is effective.

extension of algorithms developed for fluctuating hydrodynamics for ideal

capillary wave spectra with equilibrium theory. We also present several
non-equilibrium examples to illustrate the capability of the algorithm to model
multi-phase fluid phenomena in a neighborhood of the critical point. These

lower bounds on dynamic data structures and graph problems. This line of work
was initiated by P\v{a}tra\c{s}cu (STOC 2010) who reduced 3SUM to an offline
SetDisjointness problem. However, the reduction introduced by P\v{a}tra\c{s}cu
suffers from several inefficiencies, making it difficult to obtain tight
conditional lower bounds from the 3SUM conjecture.
  In this paper we address many of the deficiencies of P\v{a}tra\c{s}cu's
framework. We give new and efficient reductions from 3SUM to offline
SetDisjointness and offline SetIntersection (the reporting version of
SetDisjointness) which leads to polynomially higher lower bounds on several
problems. Using our reductions, we are able to show the essential optimality of
several algorithms, assuming the 3SUM conjecture.
  - Chiba and Nishizeki's $O(m\alpha)$-time algorithm (SICOMP 1985) for
enumerating all triangles in a graph with arboricity/degeneracy $\alpha$ is
essentially optimal, for any $\alpha$.
  - Bj{\o}rklund, Pagh, Williams, and Zwick's algorithm (ICALP 2014) for
listing $t$ triangles is essentially optimal (assuming the matrix
multiplication exponent is $\omega=2$).
  - Any static data structure for SetDisjointness that answers queries in
constant time must spend $\Omega(N^{2-o(1)})$ time in preprocessing, where $N$
is the size of the set system.
  These statements were unattainable via P\v{a}tra\c{s}cu's reductions.
  We also introduce several new reductions from 3SUM to pattern matching
problems and dynamic graph problems. Of particular interest are new conditional
lower bounds for dynamic versions of Maximum Cardinality Matching, which
introduce a new technique for obtaining amortized lower bounds.

an itinerant electron approach. Employing a multi-orbital tight-binding model
on the square lattice, we calculate the one-electron energy band within the
Hartree-Fock approximation, which leads to an antiferromagnetic ground state.
We then evaluate the two-particle Green's functions for the particle-hole pair
excitations within the random phase approximation, which are connected to the
RIXS spectra within the fast collision approximation. The calculated RIXS
spectra exhibit two-peak structure with slightly different energies in the
low-energy region, which are originated from the bound states in the
two-particle Green's function. They may be interpreted as the split modes of
magnon. We also obtain several $\delta$-function peaks, which arise from the
bound states around the bottom of energy continuum. They may be called as the
exciton modes. These characteristics are in qualitative agreement with the RIXS
experiment, demonstrating that the weak coupling theory could explain both the
magnon and the exciton peaks in the RIXS spectra on an equal footing.

angles in CMB maps. If the polarization angle is not correlated between pixels,
then the errors follow a simple $\sqrt{N_{pix}}$ law. However this is typically
not the case for CMB maps since these have correlations which result in an
increase in the variance since the effective number of independent pixels is
reduced. Then we illustrate how certain classes of systematic errors can result
in very obvious patterns in these histograms, and thus that these errors could
possibly be identified using this method. We discuss how this idea might be
applied in a realistic context, and make a preliminary analysis of the WMAP7

consistent with a constant offset in Q and U.

follows a chemical enrichment scheme based on Milky Way observations. Color and
time sensitive stellar evolution components (i.e., BHB, TP-AGB and blue

wavelength regions for comparison to new observations. In general, LSB galaxies
are well matched to the constant star formation scenario with the variation in
color explained by a fourfold increase/decrease in star formation over the last

of a scalar field to reach r $\rightarrow\infty$ in the ambient space. The
results show that the potential barrier is finite, hence the static observer at
r $\rightarrow\infty$ can indeed detect the radiation caused by the Unruh
effect from the embedding view. However the potential barriers calculated in
both the Riemann background and the Minkowski background are not coincident,
therefore the GEMS approach is not complete and the Hawking effect can be
distinguished from the Unruh effect of the GEMS in principle.

an efficient site-centered, electronic-structure technique for addressing an

azimuthal number $L_{max}=(l,m)_{max}$, while scattering matrices, which
determine spectral properties, are truncated at $L_{tr}=(l,m)_{tr}$ where phase
shifts $\delta_{l>l_{tr}}$ are negligible. Historically, $L_{max}$ is set equal
to $L_{tr}$; however, a more proper procedure retains free-electron and
single-site contributions for $L_{max}>L_{tr}$ with $\delta_{l>l_{tr}}$ set to
zero [Zhang and Butler, Phys. Rev. B {\bf 46}, 7433]. We present a numerically
efficient and accurate \emph{augmented}-KKR Green's function formalism that

Augmented-KKR yields properly normalized wave-functions, numerically cheaper
basis-set convergence, and a total charge density and electron count that
agrees with Lloyd's formula. For fcc Cu, bcc Fe and L$1_0$ CoPt, we present the

Theoretically, these quantities can be evaluated from suitable linear response
theories. For BCS superfluid, it has been found that the gauge invariant linear
response theories can be fully consistent with some stringent consistency
constraints. When the theory is generalized to stronger-than-BCS regime, one
may meet serious difficulties to satisfy the gauge invariance conditions. In
this paper, we try to construct density and spin linear response theories which
are formally gauge invariant for a Fermi gas undergoing BCS-Bose-Einstein
Condensation (BEC) crossover, especially below the superfluid transition
temperature $T_c$. We adapt a particular $t$-matrix approach which is close to
the $G_0G$ formalism to incorporate non-condensed pairing in the normal state.

confidence spheres for the mean $\boldsymbol{\theta}$ of a multivariate normal
distribution with covariance matrix $\sigma^2 \boldsymbol{I}$, for $\sigma^2$

flexible functions of the data. For the particular case of confidence spheres
centered on the positive-part James-Stein estimator and with radius determined
by empirical Bayes considerations, they show numerically that these confidence
spheres have the desired minimum coverage probability $1-\alpha$ and dominate
the usual confidence sphere in terms of scaled volume. We shift the focus from
the scaled volume to the scaled expected volume of the recentered confidence
sphere. Since both the coverage probability and the scaled expected volume are
functions of the Euclidean norm of $\boldsymbol{\theta}$, it is feasible to
optimize the performance of the recentered confidence sphere by numerically
computing both the center and radius functions so as to optimize some clearly
specified criterion. We suppose that we have uncertain prior information that
$\boldsymbol{\theta}= \boldsymbol{0}$. This motivates us to determine the
center and radius functions of the confidence sphere by numerical minimization
of the scaled expected volume of the confidence sphere at $\boldsymbol{\theta}=
\boldsymbol{0}$, subject to the constraints that (a) the coverage probability
never falls below $1-\alpha$ and (b) the radius never exceeds the radius of the
standard $1-\alpha$ confidence sphere. Our results show that, by focusing on
this clearly specified criterion, significant gains in performance (in terms of
this criterion) can be achieved. We also present analogous results for the much
more difficult case that $\sigma^2$ is unknown.

the Lya line and the non-resonant [OIII] or H-alpha line (Dv_Lya), the offset
of stacked interstellar metal absorption lines, and the spectrally-resolved
[OIII] line profile --- we study the kinematics of gas along the line of sight
to galaxies within each blob center. These three indicators generally agree in
velocity and direction, and are consistent with a simple picture in which the
gas is stationary or slowly outflowing at a few hundred km/s from the embedded
galaxies. The absence of stronger outflows is not a projection effect: the
covering fraction for our sample is limited to <1/8 (13%). The outflow
velocities exclude models in which star formation or AGN produce ""super"" or
""hyper"" winds of up to ~1000km/s. The Dv_Lya offsets here are smaller than
typical of LBGs, but similar to those of compact LAEs. The latter suggests that
outflow speed cannot be a dominant factor in driving extended Lya emission. For
one Lya blob (CDFS-LAB14), whose Lya profile and metal absorption line offsets
suggest no significant bulk motion, we use a simple radiative transfer model to
make the first column density measurement of gas in an embedded galaxy, finding
it consistent with a DLA system. Overall, the absence of clear inflow
signatures suggests that the channeling of gravitational cooling radiation into
Lya is not significant over the radii probed here. However, one peculiar system
(CDFS-LAB10) has a blueshifted Lya component that is not obviously associated
with any galaxy, suggesting either displaced gas arising from tidal
interactions among blob galaxies or gas flowing into the blob center. The
former is expected in these overdense regions, and the latter might signify the
predicted but elusive cold gas accretion along filaments.

is at the center of many problems in computer vision, recommender systems,
bio/health informatics as well as image and natural language processing. Given
pairwise dissimilarities between the elements of a `source set' and a `target
set,' we consider the problem of finding a subset of the source set, called
representatives or exemplars, that can efficiently describe the target set. We
formulate the problem as a row-sparsity regularized trace minimization problem.
Since the proposed formulation is, in general, NP-hard, we consider a convex
relaxation. The solution of our optimization finds representatives and the
assignment of each element of the target set to each representative, hence,
obtaining a clustering. We analyze the solution of our proposed optimization as
a function of the regularization parameter. We show that when the two sets
jointly partition into multiple groups, our algorithm finds representatives
from all groups and reveals clustering of the sets. In addition, we show that
the proposed framework can effectively deal with outliers. Our algorithm works
with arbitrary dissimilarities, which can be asymmetric or violate the triangle
inequality. To efficiently implement our algorithm, we consider an Alternating
Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) framework, which results in quadratic
complexity in the problem size. We show that the ADMM implementation allows to
parallelize the algorithm, hence further reducing the computational time.
Finally, by experiments on real-world datasets, we show that our proposed
algorithm improves the state of the art on the two problems of scene
categorization using representative images and time-series modeling and
segmentation using representative~models.

particles in the images thus limiting the final spatial resolution of the
instantaneous three-dimensional three-components (3D3C) velocity fields. A
volumetric velocimetry system based on Defocused Digital Particle Image
Velocimetry is used to show that above a critical visual concentration of
particles in the images, the concentration and accuracy of the final
instantaneous raw velocity vector field drop. The critical concentration
depends on physical parameters as well as on the processing algorithms. Three
distinct regimes are identified. In the first regime, the concentration is well
adapted to volumetric velocimetry, the largest concentration being optimal to
maximize the number of valid velocity vectors. In the second regime, the
performances of the detection and tracking algorithms are no longer optimal.
Finally, the third regime is strongly influenced by optical screening. A
rigorous methodology is proposed to optimize volumetric measurements taking
into account the system specifications (pixel size, focal length, system
magnification, etc.). An optimal particle concentration of 0.045
particles/pixel (ppp) is found. A relationship between the imaged concentration
and the optimal final spatial resolution for fully interpolated instantaneous

achieve the measurement of instantaneous three-dimensional velocity fields with
a good spatial resolution. It is finally successfully applied to a complex 3D

Accepted for publication in ApJ",,"10.1088/0004-637X/792/1/71",,"astro-ph.SR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The nature of the progenitor systems of type~Ia supernovae is still unclear.
One way to distinguish between the single-degenerate scenario and
double-degenerate scenario for their progenitors is to search for the surviving
companions. Using a technique that couples the results from multi-dimensional
hydrodynamics simulations with calculations of the structure and evolution of
main-sequence- and helium-rich surviving companions, the color and magnitude of
main-sequence- and helium-rich surviving companions are predicted as functions
of time. The surviving companion candidates in Galactic type~Ia supernova
remnants and nearby extragalactic type~Ia supernova remnants are discussed. We
find that the maximum detectable distance of main-sequence surviving companions
(helium-rich surviving companions) is $0.6-4$~Mpc ($0.4-16$~Mpc), if the
apparent magnitude limit is 27 in the absence of extinction, suggesting that
the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds and the Andromeda Galaxy are excellent
environments in which to search for surviving companions. However, only five
Ia~SNRs have been searched for surviving companions, showing little support for
the standard channels in the singe-degenerate scenario. To better understand
the progenitors of type Ia supernovae, we encourage the search for surviving
companions in other nearby type Ia supernova remnants.

(a) meson-baryon (MB) potentials v_{M'B',MB} derived from the phenomenological
SU(3) Lagrangian, and (b) vertex interactions Gamma_{MB,Y*} for describing the
decays of the bare excited hyperon states (Y*) into MB states. The model is
defined in a channel space spanned by the two-body barK N, pi Sigma, pi Lambda,
eta Lambda, and K Xi states and also the three-body pi pi Lambda and pi barK N
states that have the resonant pi Sigma* and barK* N components, respectively.
The resulting coupled-channels scattering equations satisfy the multichannel
unitarity conditions and account for the dynamical effects arising from the
off-shell rescattering processes. The model parameters are determined by
fitting the available data of the unpolarized and polarized observables of the
K^- p --> barK N, pi Sigma, pi Lambda, eta Lambda, K Xi reactions in the energy
region from the threshold to invariant mass W=2.1 GeV. Two models with equally
good chi^2 fits to the data have been constructed. The partial-wave amplitudes

constrain its formation mechanisms and its evolution through the star formation

inner regions of low-mass protostars. We here report a detection of the D$_2$O
1$_{1,0}$-1$_{0,1}$ transition toward the low-mass protostar NGC1333 IRAS2A
with the Plateau de Bure interferometer: this represents the first
interferometric detection of D$_2$O - and only the second solar-type protostar
for which this isotopologue is detected. Using the observations of the HDO
5$_{4,2}$-6$_{3,3}$ transition simultaneously detected and three other HDO
lines previously observed, we show that the HDO line fluxes are well reproduced
with a single excitation temperature of 218$\pm$21 K and a source size of
$\sim$0.5 arcsec. The D$_2$O/HDO ratio is $\sim$(1.2$\pm$0.5) $\times$
10$^{-2}$, while the use of previous H$_2^{18}$O observations give an
HDO/H$_2$O ratio of $\sim$(1.7$\pm$0.8) $\times$ 10$^{-3}$, i.e. a factor of 7
lower than the D$_2$O/HDO ratio. These results contradict the predictions of
current grain surface chemical models and indicate that either the surface
deuteration processes are poorly understood or that both sublimation of grain
mantles and water formation at high temperatures ($\gtrsim$230 K) take place in
the inner regions of this source. In the second scenario, the thermal
desorption of the grain mantles would explain the high D$_2$O/HDO ratio, while
water formation at high temperature would explain significant extra production
of H$_2$O leading to a decrease of the HDO/H$_2$O ratio.

occur at the highest energies consistent with the relative stability of WO4

have calculated the enthalpies of the scheelite and fergusonite phases as a
function of pressure, which confirms that the scheelite to fergusonite
transition is second order in nature. With increase in pressure, there is a
gradual change in the AO8 polyhedra, while there is no apparent change in the
WO4 tetrahedra. We found that that all the four tungstates amorphize at high
pressure. This is in good agreement with available experimental observations

amorphization, there is an abrupt increase in the coordination of the W atom

Supervised Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (supervised vbNMF) with
label-driven sparsity structure of coefficients is proposed for learning of
discriminative nonsubtractive latent semantic components occuring in TF-IDF
document representations. Constraints are such that the components pursued are
made to be frequently occuring in a small set of labels only, making it
possible to yield document representations with distinctive label-specific
sparse activation patterns. A simple measure of quality of this kind of
sparsity structure, dubbed inter-label sparsity, is introduced and
experimentally brought into tight connection with classification performance.
Representing a great practical convenience, inter-label sparsity is shown to be
easily controlled in supervised vbNMF by a single parameter.

In this paper, we explore the costs of providing wait-freedom to only a

crucial question is to understand what is the mutual interaction between birds
generating such nontrivial correlations. Here we use the Maximum Entropy (ME)
approach to infer from experimental data of natural flocks the effective
interactions between birds. Compared to previous studies, we make a significant
step forward as we retrieve the full functional dependence of the interaction
on distance and find that it decays exponentially over a range of a few

method is able to discriminate the relevant information encoded in such

predicts that the immune system will have more receptors for rare antigens than
expected from the frequency of encounters; individuals exposed to the same
infections will have sparse repertoires that are largely different, but
nevertheless exploit cross-reactivity to provide the same coverage of antigens;
and the optimal repertoires can be reached via the dynamics of competitive
binding of antigens by receptors, and selective amplification of stimulated
receptors. Our results follow from a tension between the statistics of pathogen
detection, which favor a broader receptor distribution, and the effects of

create a novel one and how rapidly technology ages. Two different models of
combinatorial growth are considered, involving different forms of ageing. When
long-range memory is used and thus old inventions are available for novel
innovations, singularities can emerge under some conditions with two phases

strong spectral broadening of the generated THz field. Diffraction limits the
achievable THz bandwidth by efficiently depleting the low frequency amplitudes

(SN) types in spirals with various morphologies and in barred or unbarred
galaxies. We use a well-defined and homogeneous sample of spiral host galaxies
of 692 SNe from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey in different stages of
galaxy-galaxy interaction and activity classes of nucleus. We propose that the
underlying mechanisms shaping the number ratios of SNe types can be interpreted
within the framework of interaction-induced star formation, in addition to the
known relations between morphologies and stellar populations. We find a strong
trend in behaviour of the NIa/NCC ratio depending on host morphology, such that
early spirals include more Type Ia SNe. The NIbc/NII ratio is higher in a broad
bin of early-type hosts. The NIa/NCC ratio is nearly constant when changing
from normal, perturbed to interacting galaxies, then declines in merging
galaxies, whereas it jumps to the highest value in post-merging/remnant
galaxies. In contrast, the NIbc/NII ratio jumps to the highest value in merging
galaxies and slightly declines in post-merging/remnant subsample. The
interpretation is that the star formation rates and morphologies of galaxies,
which are strongly affected in the final stages of interaction, have an impact
on the number ratios of SNe types. The NIa/NCC (NIbc/NII) ratio increases
(decreases) from star-forming to active galactic nuclei (AGN) classes of
galaxies. These variations are consistent with the scenario of an
interaction-triggered starburst evolving into AGN during the later stages of
interaction, accompanied with the change of star formation and transformation
of the galaxy morphology into an earlier type.

Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH). The prolate molecular clouds in our
investigation are set with their semi-major axis perpendicular to the radiative
direction of a plane parallel ionising Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) flux.
  Simulations on three high mass prolate clouds reveal that EUV radiation can
trigger distinctive high density core formation embedded in a final linear
structure. This contrasts with results of the previous work in which only an
isotropic Far Ultraviolet (FUV) interstellar background flux was applied.
  A systematic investigation on a group of prolate clouds of equal mass but
different initial densities and geometric shapes finds that the distribution of
the cores over the final linear structure changes with the initial conditions
of the prolate cloud and the strength of the EUV radiation flux. These highly
condensed cores may either scatter over the full length of the final linear
structure or form two groups of high density cores at two foci, depending on
the value of the ionising radiation penetration depth d_EUV, the ratio of the
physical ionising radiation penetration depth to the minor axis of the cloud.
Data anlysis on the total mass of the high density cores and the core formation
time finds that the potential for EUV radiation triggered star formation
efficiency is higher in prolate clouds with shallow ionisation penetration
depth and intermediate major to minor axial ratio, for the physical
environments investigated.
  Finally, it is suggested that the various fragment-core structures observed
at Hii boundaries may result from the interaction between ionising radiation
and pre-existing prolate clouds of different initial geometrical and physical
conditions.

International Virtual Observatory Alliance, but hides the technicalities of
such standards by implementing different layers of abstraction on top of them.
Such intermediate layers provide hooks that users and developers can exploit in
order to extend the capabilities provided by Iris. For instance, custom Python
models can be combined in arbitrary ways with the Iris built-in models or with
other custom functions. As such, Iris offers a platform for the development and

suppressed with hole-doping. We discuss why the common association of the
renormalization of the Drude weight with that of the kinetic energy, used in
single band systems, does not hold in multi-orbital systems. This applies even
in a Fermi liquid description when each orbital is renormalized differently, as
it happens in iron superconductors. We estimate the contribution of interband
transitions at low energies. We show that this contribution is strongly
enhanced by interactions and dominates the coherent part of the spectral weight
in hole-doped samples at frequencies currently used to determine the Drude
weight.

at subcritical heat flux parameters. Thus, when the effect of heat fluxes is
not profound acoustic waves will grow due to the velocity shear, while at
supercritical heat fluxes the flow reveals compressible thermal instability.
Anisotropic thermal instability should be also important in astrophysical

a subsample of $\simeq$ 1000 AGN in the footprint of the SDSS area (covering
120 deg$^2$) with available spectroscopic redshifts. We searched for highly
obscured AGN by applying an automated selection technique based on X-ray
spectral analysis that is capable of efficiently selecting AGN. The selection
is based on the presence of either a) flat rest-frame spectra; b) flat observed
spectra; c) an absorption turnover, indicative of a high rest-frame column
density; or d) an Fe K$\alpha$ line with an equivalent width > 500 eV. We found
81 highly obscured candidate sources. Subsequent detailed manual spectral fits
revealed that 28 of them are heavily absorbed by column densities higher than
10$^{23}$ cm$^{-2}$. Of these 28 AGN, 15 are candidate Compton-thick AGN on the
basis of either a high column density, consistent within the 90% confidence
level with N$_{\rm H}$ $>$10$^{24}$ cm$^{-2}$, or a large equivalent width
(>500 eV) of the Fe K$\alpha$ line. Another six are associated with
near-Compton-thick AGN with column densities of $\sim$ 5$\times$10$^{23}$

diffuse-domain method (DDM) for solving partial differential equations in
complex, dynamic geometries with Dirichlet, Neumann, and Robin boundary
conditions. The diffuse-domain method uses an implicit representation of the
geometry where the sharp boundary is replaced by a diffuse layer with thickness
$\epsilon$ that is typically proportional to the minimum grid size. The
original equations are reformulated on a larger regular domain and the boundary
conditions are incorporated via singular source terms. The resulting equations
can be solved with standard finite difference and finite element software
packages. Here, we present a matched asymptotic analysis of general
diffuse-domain methods for Neumann and Robin boundary conditions. Our analysis
shows that for certain choices of the boundary condition approximations, the
DDM is second-order accurate in $\epsilon$. However, for other choices the DDM
is only first-order accurate. This helps to explain why the choice of
boundary-condition approximation is important for rapid global convergence and
high accuracy. Our analysis also suggests correction terms that may be added to
yield more accurate diffuse-domain methods. Simple modifications of first-order
boundary condition approximations are proposed to achieve asymptotically

3-qubit GHZ-class states"", (Physical Review Letters 102, 250404 (2009)), does
very important work on studying the nature of Svetlichny Inequalities (which
are Bell-type inequalities) and sheds light on some important properties and
relationship between Svetlichny inequality and tripartite entanglement. It
derives a result for the maximum expectation value of Svetlichny operator for
GGHZ and MS states. In this comment, it is put forth that there is probably a
mistake in the central result derived in the paper.

scalar equation on the plane, is revisited from the perspective of the
supersymmetric quantum mechanics, and attention is drawn to the fact that it
naturally emerges in the small hyperbolic angle approximation to the ""curved""
Higgs oscillator on the hyperbolic plane, i.e. on the upper part of the
two-dimensional hyperboloid of two sheets, a space of constant negative
curvature. Such occurs because the particle dynamics under consideration
reduces to the one dimensional Schr\""odinger equation with the second
hyperbolic P\""oschl-Teller potential, whose flat-space (small-angle) limit
reduces to the conformally invariant inverse square distance plus harmonic
oscillator interaction, on which LFH is based. In consequence, energies and
wave functions of the LFH spectrum can be approached by the solutions of the
Higgs oscillator on the hyperbolic plane in employing its curvature and the
potential strength as fitting parameters. Also the proton electric charge form
factor is well reproduced within this scheme by means of a Fourier-Helgason
hyperbolic wave transform of the charge density. In conclusion, in the small
angle approximation, the Higgs oscillator on the hyperbolic plane is
demonstrated to satisfactory parallel essential outcomes of the Light Front
Holographic QCD. The findings are suggestive of associating the hyperboloid
curvature of the with a second scale in LFH, which then could be employed in
the definition of a chemical potential.

  Modeling Interference Competition with an Infectious Disease",,,,,"q-bio.PE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Gray wolves were reintroduced to Yellowstone National Park (YNP) in 1995. The
population initially flourished, but since 2003 the population has experience
significant reductions due to factors that may include disease-induced
mortality, illegal hunting, park control pro- grams, vehicle induced deaths and
intra-species aggression. Despite facing similar conditions, and interference
competition with the wolves, the coyote population at YNP has persisted. In
this paper we introduce an epidemiological framework that incorporates natural,
human-caused and disease-induced mortality as well as interference competition
between two species of predators. The outcomes generated by this theoretical
framework are used to explore the impact of competition and death-induced
mechanisms on predators coexistence. It is the hope that these results on the
competitive dynamics of carnivores in Yellowstone National Park will provide
park management insights that result in policies that keep the reintroduction
of wolves successful.
