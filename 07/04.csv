at degree scales by BICEP2 is due to the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB)
would be the measurement of its large-scale counterpart. We assess the
requirements for diffuse component separation accuracy over large portions of
the sky in order to measure the large-scale B-mode signal corresponding to a
tensor to scalar ratio of r=0.1-0.2.
  We use the method proposed by Bonaldi & Ricciardi (2011) to forecast the
performances of different simulated experiments taking into account noise and
foreground removal issues. We do not consider instrumental systematics, and we
implicitly assume that they are not the dominant source of error. If this is
the case, the confirmation of an r=0.1-0.2 signal is achievable by Planck even
for conservative assumptions regarding the accuracy of foreground cleaning. Our
forecasts suggest that the combination of this experiment with BICEP2 will lead
to an improvement of 25-45% in the constraint on r.
  A next-generation CMB polarization satellite, represented in this work by the
COrE experiment, can reduce dramatically (by almost another order of magnitude)
the uncertainty on r. In this case, however, the accuracy of foreground removal
becomes critical to fully benefit from the increase in sensitivity.

behaviour and cortical computation. However, two basic and ubiquitous
properties of cortical responses seem difficult to reconcile with probabilistic
inference: neural activity displays prominent oscillations in response to
constant input, and large transient changes in response to stimulus onset. Here
we show that these dynamical behaviours may in fact be understood as hallmarks
of the specific representation and algorithm that the cortex employs to perform
probabilistic inference. We demonstrate that a particular family of
probabilistic inference algorithms, Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC), naturally
maps onto the dynamics of excitatory-inhibitory neural networks. Specifically,
we constructed a model of an excitatory-inhibitory circuit in primary visual
cortex that performed HMC inference, and thus inherently gave rise to
oscillations and transients. These oscillations were not mere epiphenomena but
served an important functional role: speeding up inference by rapidly spanning
a large volume of state space. Inference thus became an order of magnitude more
efficient than in a non-oscillatory variant of the model. In addition, the
network matched two specific properties of observed neural dynamics that would
otherwise be difficult to account for in the context of probabilistic
inference. First, the frequency of oscillations as well as the magnitude of
transients increased with the contrast of the image stimulus. Second,
excitation and inhibition were balanced, and inhibition lagged excitation.
These results suggest a new functional role for the separation of cortical
populations into excitatory and inhibitory neurons, and for the neural
oscillations that emerge in such excitatory-inhibitory networks: enhancing the
efficiency of cortical computations.

equator rotates fastest and anti-solar (AS) otherwise. Hydrodynamic simulations
show a transition from SL to AS rotation as the influence of rotation on
convection is reduced, but the opposite transition occurs at a different point
in the parameter space. The system is bistable, i.e., SL and AS rotation
profiles can both be stable. We study the effect of a dynamo-generated magnetic
field on the large-scale flows, particularly on the possibility of bistable
behavior of differential rotation. We solve the hydromagnetic equations
numerically in a rotating spherical shell for a set of different radiative
conductivities controlling the relative importance of convection. In agreement
with earlier findings, our models display SL rotation profiles when the
rotational influence on convection is strong and a transition to AS when the
rotational influence decreases. We find that dynamo-generated magnetic fields
help to produce SL differential rotation compared to the hydrodynamic
simulations. We do not observe any bistable states of differential rotation. In
the AS cases we get coherent single-cell meridional circulation, whereas in SL
cases we get multi-cellular patterns. In both cases, we obtain poleward
circulation near the surface with a magnitude close to that observed in the
Sun. Moreover, both differential rotation and meridional circulation have
significant magnetic cycle-related variations that are similar in strength to
those of the Sun. Purely hydrodynamic simulations of differential rotation and
meridional circulation are shown to be of limited relevance as magnetic fields,
self-consistently generated by dynamo action, significantly affect the flows.

explicitly breaks scale invariance. However, in field theory we demonstrated
recently that the gravitational constant, which is directly related to the
string length, can be promoted to a dynamical field if the standard model
coupled to gravity (SM+GR) is lifted to a locally scale (Weyl) invariant
theory. The higher gauge symmetry reveals previously unknown field patches
whose inclusion turn the classically conformally invariant SM+GR into a
geodesically complete theory with new cosmological and possibly further
physical consequences. In this paper this concept is extended to string theory
by showing how it can be Weyl lifted with a local scale symmetry acting on
target space background fields. In this process the string tension (fundamental
string length) is promoted to a dynamical field, in agreement with the parallel
developments in field theory. We then propose a string theory in a geodesically
complete cosmological stringy background which suggests previously unimagined
directions in the stringy exploration of the very early universe.

freedom on the boundary, and when these boundary states delocalize into the
bulk, a phase transition occurs and the system becomes topologically trivial.
We show that tensor networks provide a natural framework for analyzing such
topological phase transitions in terms of the boundary degrees of freedom which
mediate it. To do so, we make use of a correspondence between a topologically
nontrivial ground state and its phase transition to a trivial phase established
in [1]. This involved computing the bulk entanglement spectrum (BES) of the
ground state, upon tracing out an extensive subsystem. This work implements BES
via tensor network representations of ground states. In this framework, the
universality class of the quantum critical entanglement Hamiltonian in d
spatial dimensions is either derived analytically or mapped to a classical
statistical model in d + 1 dimensions, which can be studied using Monte Carlo
or tensor renormalization group methods. As an example, we analytically derive
the universality classes of topological phase transitions from the spin-1 chain
Haldane phase and demonstrate that the AKLT wavefunction (and its
generalizations) remarkably contains critical six-vertex (and in general
eight-vertex) models within it.

young stellar objects (YSOs) projected onto the cavity. The total molecular
mass in the shell and the mean H$_2$ volume density are ~ 40 solar masses and

to extract the dynamics of the inhomogeneous perturbations, separating them

$\overline{B} -> D(D^{(*)})\ell\nu. In this case, more involved from the

representations of the Lorentz group contribute. We obtain an integral
representation for the IW function xi(w) with a positive measure, recover the
bounds for the slope and the curvature of xi(w) obtained from the
Bjorken-Uraltsev sum rule method, and get new bounds for higher derivatives. We
demonstrate also that if the lower bound for the slope is saturated, the
measure is a delta-function, and xi(w) is given by an explicit elementary
function. Inverting the integral formula, we obtain the measure in terms of the
IW function, allowing to formulate criteria to decide if a given ansatz for the
Isgur-Wise function is compatible or not with the sum rule constraints.
Moreover, we have obtained an upper bound on the IW function valid for any
value of w. We compare these theoretical constraints to a number of forms for
\xi(w) proposed in the literature. The ""dipole"" function \xi(w) =
(2/(w+1))^(2c) satisfies all constraints for c \geq 3/4, while the QCD Sum Rule
result including condensates does not satisfy them. Special care is devoted to
the Bakamjian-Thomas relativistic quark model in the heavy quark limit and to
the description of the Lorentz group representation that underlies this model.

Simulations show that the minimum ignition energies of an ideal configuration

travelling longer distances (longer detection length) as compared to
high-frequency waves. We found two distinct dissipation length scales of wave
amplitude decay at two different height ranges (between 0--10 Mm and 10--70 Mm)
along the observed plume structure. The dissipation lengths obtained at higher
height range show some frequency dependence. Individual Fourier power spectrum

nearly Gaussian distributions. Propagating slow magneto-acoustic waves are
getting heavily damped (small dissipation lengths) within the first 10~Mm

dependent dissipation lengths of wave propagation at higher heights may
indicate the possibility of wave dissipation due to thermal conduction,

such periods per star. They occur in a range roughly between 50 and 3000 days.
Inter-relationships between these periods were analyzed using the ""double

identify six sequences of accumulation of the period values. For five of these

coincidence with those of previous studies which were based on very different
samples of semi-regular red variables. Therefore, existence and locations of
these sequences in the diagrams seem to be universal features, which appear in
any data set of semi-regularly variable red giants of the AGB; we conclude that
they are caused by different pulsation modes as the typical and consistent
properties of similar stellar AGB configurations. Stellar pulsations can be
considered as the principal cause of the observed periodic variability of these

evolutionary biology, sociology, economics, and beyond. For evolutionary
biologists in particular the question is often how such behaviors can arise
\textit{de novo} in a simple evolving system. How can group behaviors such as
collective action, or decision making that accounts for memories of past
experience, emerge and persist? Evolutionary game theory provides a framework
for formalizing these questions and admitting them to rigorous study. Here we
develop such a framework to study the evolution of sustained collective action
in multi-player public-goods games, in which players have arbitrarily long
memories of prior rounds of play and can react to their experience in an
arbitrary way. To study this problem we construct a coordinate system for
memory-$m$ strategies in iterated $n$-player games that permits us to
characterize all the cooperative strategies that resist invasion by any mutant
strategy, and thus stabilize cooperative behavior. We show that while larger
games inevitably make cooperation harder to evolve, there nevertheless always
exists a positive volume of strategies that stabilize cooperation provided the
population size is large enough. We also show that, when games are small,
longer-memory strategies make cooperation easier to evolve, by increasing the
number of ways to stabilize cooperation. Finally we explore the co-evolution of
behavior and memory capacity, and we find that longer-memory strategies tend to
evolve in small games, which in turn drives the evolution of cooperation even
when the benefits for cooperation are low.

exist. Classic evolutionary models such as the Wright-Fisher model, as well as
more recent models of travelling waves, have focused on purely relative
competitions, in which fitness continues to increase indefinitely, without
actually progressing anywhere. This manuscript proposes a new way to describe
both at the same time. It begins with a revised version of r/K-selection
theory. r continues to describe maximum reproductive speed, but the new version
of K, with a different subscript, now describes parsimoniousness in territory
use, a group-selected, anti-tragedy-of-the-commons trait. A third dimension c
of fitness is then added to this novel system, one which is unitless and
normalized, and hence capable of capturing the population genetics concept w of
a strictly relative, genetically-limited competitive race. MacArthur's original
version of r/K-selection theory is shown to confound parsimoniousness K with
competitive ability c, despite the fact that available data suggests a negative
correlation between the two; here they are disentangled. A rotation of the
resulting three-dimensional system provides a population genetic underpinning
for Grime's universal adaptive strategy theory of ruderals (selected for high

topological order. We derive the corresponding parent Hamiltonian, which is a
frustration free gauge theory Hamiltonian closely related to the Kogut-Susskind

able to suggest the shortest route. The goal of this work is to automatically
suggest routes that are not only short but also emotionally pleasant. To
quantify the extent to which urban locations are pleasant, we use data from a
crowd-sourcing platform that shows two street scenes in London (out of
hundreds), and a user votes on which one looks more beautiful, quiet, and
happy. We consider votes from more than 3.3K individuals and translate them
into quantitative measures of location perceptions. We arrange those locations
into a graph upon which we learn pleasant routes. Based on a quantitative
validation, we find that, compared to the shortest routes, the recommended ones
add just a few extra walking minutes and are indeed perceived to be more
beautiful, quiet, and happy. To test the generality of our approach, we
consider Flickr metadata of more than 3.7M pictures in London and 1.3M in
Boston, compute proxies for the crowdsourced beauty dimension (the one for
which we have collected the most votes), and evaluate those proxies with 30
participants in London and 54 in Boston. These participants have not only rated
our recommendations but have also carefully motivated their choices, providing
insights for future work.

This relation extends even further at the phase transitions where a direct link
associates the entanglement spectrum to the conformal field theory describing
the former. For 2D systems much less is known. The lattice geometry becomes a
crucial aspect to consider when studying entanglement and phase transitions.
Here, we analyze the entanglement properties of triangular spin lattice models
by considering also concepts borrowed from quantum information theory such as

interdisciplinary sciences from 1960 to 2010. Our approach relies on
quantifying the interdisciplinarity of research communities detected in the
coauthorship network of Slovenian scientists over time. Examining the evolution
of the community structure, we find that the frequency of interdisciplinary
research is only proportional with the overall growth of the network. Although
marginal improvements in favor of interdisciplinarity are inferable during the
70s and 80s, the overall trends during the past 20 years are constant and
indicative of stalemate. We conclude that the flow of knowledge between
different fields of research in Slovenia is in need of further stimulation.

equations are shown to be equivalent to the continuity, Navier-Stokes, and
energy conservation equations of a compressible viscous fluid. The derivations
of the Euler and Navier-Stokes Hamiltonians are compared, with the former
having identical dynamics to the Euler equation with the viscosity terms of the
Navier-Stokes equation dropped from the beginning. The two Hamiltonians have
the same number of degrees of freedom in three spatial and one temporal
dimension: six independent scalar potentials, but their dynamical fields are
necessarily different due to a theory with dissipation not mapping smoothly
onto one without. The dynamical coordinate field of a dissipative fluid is a
vector field that stores the initial position of all of its fluid particles.
Thus these appear to be natural coordinates for studying arbitrary separations
of fluid particles over time. The classical similarity renormalization group is
introduced and the first steps are carried out deriving a flow equation for the
Navier-Stokes Hamiltonian. Finally, the symmetries of a nonrelativistic viscous
fluid are discussed through its galilean algebra with dissipative canonical
Poisson brackets.

probability distribution functions (PDF) of event locations to improve the
spatial information content of seismic catalogs. The method reduces the size of
seismic catalogs while improving the access to the spatial information content
of seismic catalogs. The PDFs of events are first ranked by decreasing location
errors and then successively condensed onto better located and lower variance
event PDFs. The obtained condensed catalog attributes different weights to each
event, providing an optimal spatial representation with respect to the
spatially varying location capability of the seismic network. Synthetic tests
on fractal distributions perturbed with realistic location errors show that
condensation improves spatial information content of the original catalog.
Applied to Southern California seismicity, the new condensed catalog highlights
major mapped fault traces and reveals possible additional structures while
reducing the catalog length by ~25%. The condensation method allows us to
account for location error information within a point based spatial analysis.
We demonstrate this by comparing the multifractal properties of the condensed
catalog locations with those of the original catalog. We evidence different
spatial scaling regimes characterized by distinct multifractal spectra and
separated by transition scales. We interpret the upper scale as to agree with
the thickness of the brittle crust, while the lower scale (2.5km) might depend
on the relocation procedure. Accounting for these new results, the Epidemic
Type Aftershock Model formulation suggests that, contrary to previous studies,
large earthquakes dominate the earthquake triggering process. This implies that
the limited capability of detecting small magnitude events cannot be used to
argue that earthquakes are unpredictable in general.

algebraic long-distance decay as opposite to the exponential behaviour found

quick approach to an almost stationary value is followed by a slow algebraic
relaxation to the true stationary state.

of the dominance of capillarity at small length scales. The imbibition kinetics
are, however, solely determined by the static geometry of the porous host, the
capillarity, and the fluidity of the imbibed liquid. This makes active control
particularly challenging. Here, we show for aqueous electrolyte imbibition in
nanoporous gold that the fluid flow can be reversibly switched on and off
through electric potential control of the solid-liquid interfacial tension,
i.e. we can accelerate the imbibition front, stop it, and have it proceed at
will. Simultaneous measurements of the mass flux and the electrical current
allow us to document simple scaling laws for the imbibition kinetics, and to
explore the charge flow dynamics in the metallic nanopores. Our findings
demonstrate that the high electric conductivity along with the pathways for
ionic and/or fluid transport render nanoporous elemental gold a versatile,
accurately controllable electro-capillary pump and flow sensor for minute
amounts of liquids with exceptionally low operating voltages.

activity. We re-observed CoRoT-7 in January 2012 with both HARPS and CoRoT, so
that we now have the benefit of simultaneous radial-velocity and photometric
data. This allows us to use the off-transit variations in the star's light
curve to estimate the radial-velocity variations induced by the suppression of
convective blueshift and the flux blocked by starspots. To account for
activity-related effects in the radial-velocities which do not have a
photometric signature, we also include an additional activity term in the
radial-velocity model, which we treat as a Gaussian process with the same
covariance properties (and hence the same frequency structure) as the light
curve. Our model was incorporated into a Monte Carlo Markov Chain in order to
make a precise determination of the orbits of CoRoT-7b and CoRoT-7c. We measure
the masses of planets b and c to be 4.73 +/- 0.95 Mearth and 13.56 +/- 1.08

for evidence of an additional planet d, identified by previous authors with a
period close to 9 days. We are not able to confirm the existence of a planet
with this orbital period, which is close to the second harmonic of the stellar
rotation at around 7.9 days. Using Bayesian model selection we find that a

the HiZELS survey, with the new KMOS near-infrared, multi-IFU instrument on the
VLT, in order to obtain their dynamics and metallicity gradients. The majority
of our galaxies have a metallicity gradient consistent with being flat or
negative (i.e. higher metallicity cores than outskirts). Intriguingly, we find
a trend between metallicity gradient and specific star formation rate (sSFR),
such that galaxies with a high sSFR tend to have relatively metal-poor centres,
a result which is strengthened when combined with datasets from the literature.
This result appears to explain the discrepancies reported between different
high redshift studies and varying claims for evolution. From a galaxy evolution
perspective, the trend we see would mean that a galaxy's sSFR is governed by
the amount of metal poor gas that can be funnelled into its core, triggered
either by merging or through efficient accretion. In fact merging may play a
significant role as it is the starburst galaxies at all epochs, which have the
more positive metallicity gradients. Our results may help to explain the origin
of the fundamental metallicity relation, in which galaxies at a fixed mass are
observed to have lower metallicities at higher star formation rates, especially
if the metallicity is measured in an aperture encompassing only the central
regions of the galaxy. Finally, we note that this study demonstrates the power
of KMOS as an efficient instrument for large scale resolved galaxy surveys.

of any possible non-slow-roll background evolution prior to the final stage of
slow-roll inflation. We find a high degree of universality since most common
backgrounds like fast-roll evolution, matter or radiation-dominance give rise
to a power loss at large angular scales and a peak together with an oscillatory
behaviour at scales around the value of the Hubble parameter at the beginning
of slow-roll inflation. Depending on the value of the equation of state
parameter, different pre-inflationary epochs lead instead to an enhancement of
power at low-$\ell$, and so seem disfavoured by recent observational hints for
a lack of CMB power at $\ell\lesssim 40$. We also comment on the importance of

description originally developed in QCD that allows to consider black holes in
a relativistic Hartree like framework. As an application of our framework we
calculate the cross section for scattering processes between graviton emitters

gravitons. We show that these scatterings allow to directly extract structural
observables such as the momentum distribution of black hole constituents.

been liberated from material surrounding the detector by a combination of 8B
solar neutrinos and atmospheric muons. The phase of the muon modulation lags 30
days behind the data, however we show that adding the modulated neutrino

estimate that neutrinos and muons need around 1000 m^3 of scattering material

engine model predicts an observable plateau phase, with plateau durations and
luminosities being determined by the magnetic fields and spin periods of the
newly formed magnetar. This paper analytically shows that the magnetar central
engine model can explain, within the 1$\sigma$ uncertainties, the correlation
between plateau luminosity and duration. The observed scatter in the
correlation most likely originates in the spread of initial spin periods of the
newly formed magnetar and provides an estimate of the maximum spin period of
~35 ms (assuming a constant mass, efficiency and beaming across the GRB
sample). Additionally, by combining the observed data and simulations, we show
that the magnetar emission is most likely narrowly beamed and has $\lesssim$20%
efficiency in conversion of rotational energy from the magnetar into the
observed plateau luminosity. The beaming angles and efficiencies obtained by
this method are fully consistent with both predicted and observed values. We
find that Short GRBs and Short GRBs with Extended Emission lie on the same
correlation but are statistically inconsistent with being drawn from the same
distribution as Long GRBs, this is consistent with them having a wider beaming
angle than Long GRBs.

formation histories remain uncertain. To address this situation, we have
initiated the MASSIVE Survey, a volume-limited, multi-wavelength,
integral-field spectroscopic (IFS) and photometric survey of the structure and
dynamics of the ~100 most massive early-type galaxies within a distance of 108
Mpc. This survey probes a stellar mass range M* > 10^{11.5} Msun and diverse
galaxy environments that have not been systematically studied to date. Our
wide-field IFS data cover about two effective radii of individual galaxies, and
for a subset of them, we are acquiring additional IFS observations on
sub-arcsecond scales with adaptive optics. We are also acquiring deep K-band
imaging to trace the extended halos of the galaxies and measure accurate total
magnitudes. Dynamical orbit modeling of the combined data will allow us to
simultaneously determine the stellar, black hole, and dark matter halo masses.
The primary goals of the project are to constrain the black hole scaling
relations at high masses, investigate systematically the stellar initial mass
function and dark matter distribution in massive galaxies, and probe the
late-time assembly of ellipticals through stellar population and kinematical
gradients. In this paper, we describe the MASSIVE sample selection, discuss the
distinct demographics and structural and environmental properties of the
selected galaxies, and provide an overview of our basic observational program,
science goals and early survey results.

during the same impact event that placed Charon in orbit and had been pushed to
their current positions by being locked in mean-motion resonances with Charon
as Charon's orbit was expanded by tidal interactions with Pluto. Using the
Pluto-Charon tidal evolution models developed by Cheng et al. (2014), we show
that stable capture and transport of a test particle in multiple resonances at
the same mean-motion commensurability is possible at the 5:1, 6:1, and 7:1

particle has significant orbital eccentricity at the end of the tidal evolution
of Pluto-Charon in almost all cases, and there are no stable captures and
transports at the 3:1 and 4:1 commensurabilities. Furthermore, a non-zero
hydrostatic value of $J_{2P}$ destroys the conditions necessary for multiple
resonance migration. Simulations with finite but minimal masses of Nix and

the intensities of the surrounding environment in the slit-jaw images. About

paper develops a non-convex formulation of the phase retrieval problem as well
as a concrete solution algorithm. In a nutshell, this algorithm starts with a
careful initialization obtained by means of a spectral method, and then refines
this initial estimate by iteratively applying novel update rules, which have
low computational complexity, much like in a gradient descent scheme. The main
contribution is that this algorithm is shown to rigorously allow the exact
retrieval of phase information from a nearly minimal number of random
measurements. Indeed, the sequence of successive iterates provably converges to
the solution at a geometric rate so that the proposed scheme is efficient both
in terms of computational and data resources. In theory, a variation on this
scheme leads to a near-linear time algorithm for a physically realizable model
based on coded diffraction patterns. We illustrate the effectiveness of our
methods with various experiments on image data. Underlying our analysis are
insights for the analysis of non-convex optimization schemes that may have

their quantum phase transitions. The method itself is described, and it is
shown how it may be implemented in practice to high orders in a systematically
improvable hierarchy of (so-called LSUB$m$) approximations, by the use of
computer-algebraic techniques. The method works from the outset in the
thermodynamic limit of an infinite lattice at all levels of approximation, and
it is shown both how the ""raw"" LSUB$m$ results are themselves generally
excellent in the sense that they converge rapidly, and how they may accurately
be extrapolated to the exact limit, $m \rightarrow \infty$, of the truncation
index $m$, which denotes the {\it only} approximation made. All of this is
illustrated via a specific application to a two-dimensional, frustrated,
spin-half $J^{XXZ}_{1}$--$J^{XXZ}_{2}$ model on a honeycomb lattice with
nearest-neighbor and next-nearest-neighbor interactions with exchange couplings
$J_{1}>0$ and $J_{2} \equiv \kappa J_{1} > 0$, respectively, where both
interactions are of the same anisotropic $XXZ$ type. We show how the method can
be used to determine the entire zero-temperature ground-state phase diagram of
the model in the range $0 \leq \kappa \leq 1$ of the frustration parameter and
$0 \leq \Delta \leq 1$ of the spin-space anisotropy parameter. In particular,
we identify a candidate quantum spin-liquid region in the phase space.

explained in a polaronic scenario. Charge carriers form strongly localized
polarons in the insulating phase as suggested by a far-infrared charge gap
abruptly opening at T_MIT = 237 K. In the metallic phase instead the presence
of a Drude term is indicative of fairly delocalized charges with a moderately

present the wavelet spectral composition and multiscale variations of the time

Methods. We applied the Morlet wavelet (6th order), which offers high time and
frequency resolution. By applying the wavelet transform to the signal, we
obtain the wavelet local and global power spectra. The first is interpreted as
energy distribution of the signal in time-frequency space, and the second is
obtained by time integration of the local map. Results. Since the wavelet
transform is a useful mathematical tool for nonstationary signals, this
technique applied to Kepler and CoRoT light curves allows us to clearly
identify particular signatures for different phenomena. In particular, patterns
were identified for the temporal evolution of the rotation period and other
periodicity due to active regions affecting these light curves. In addition, a
beat-pattern signature in the local wavelet map of pulsating stars over the

presented, and its performance is predicated by numerical analysis based on the
full-wave finite-difference-time-domain method. The simulated result shows
that, comparing with a conventional PCA, the proposed PCA achieves $1.4$ times

in protoplanetary disks, we investigate the probability distribution function
(PDF) of the relative velocity of inertial particles suspended in turbulent
flows. Using the simulation from our previous work, we compute the relative
velocity PDF as a function of the friction timescales, tau_p1 and tau_p2, of
two particles of arbitrary sizes. The friction time of particles included in
the simulation ranges from 0.1 tau_eta to 54T_L, with tau_eta and T_L the
Kolmogorov time and the Lagrangian correlation time of the flow, respectively.
The relative velocity PDF is generically non-Gaussian, exhibiting fat tails.
For a fixed value of tau_p1, the PDF is the fattest for equal-size particles
(tau_p2~tau_p1), and becomes thinner at both tau_p2<tau_ p1 and tau_p2>tau_p1.
Defining f as the friction time ratio of the smaller particle to the larger
one, we find that, at a given f in 1/2<f<1, the PDF fatness first increases
with the friction time, tau_ph, of the larger particle, peaks at
tau_ph~tau_eta, and then decreases as tau_ph increases further. For 0<f<1/4,
the PDF shape becomes continuously thinner with increasing tau_ph. The PDF is
nearly Gaussian only if tau_ph is sufficiently large (>>T_L). These features
are successfully explained by the Pan & Padoan model. Using our simulation data
and some simplifying assumptions, we estimated the fractions of collisions
resulting in sticking, bouncing, and fragmentation as a function of the dust
size in protoplanerary disks, and argued that accounting for non-Gaussianity of
the collision velocity may help further alleviate the bouncing barrier problem.

several decoding algorithmswith different degrees of base stations' cooperation
(non-cooperative, spatial, temporal, and spatio-temporal). With spatial
cooperation, neighboring base stations inform each other whenever they collect
a user within their coverage overlap; temporal cooperation corresponds to
(temporal) successive interference cancellation done locally at each station.
We analyze the four decoding algorithms and establish several fundamental
results. With all algorithms, the peak throughput (average number of decoded
users per slot, across all base stations) increases linearly with the number of
base stations. Further, temporal and spatio-temporal cooperations exhibit a
threshold behavior with respect to the normalized load (number of users per
station, per slot). There exists a positive load $G^\star$, such that, below
$G^\star$, the decoding probability is asymptotically maximal possible, equal
the probability that a user is heard by at least one base station; with
non-cooperative decoding and spatial cooperation, we show that $G^\star$ is
zero. Finally, with spatio-temporal cooperation, we optimize the degree
distribution according to which users transmit their packet replicas; the
optimum is in general very different from the corresponding optimal
distribution of the single-base station system.

Werner H_2 transitions, with approximately 79% completeness for H_2 column
densities above N(H_2)=10^17.5 cm^-2 for an assumed Doppler broadening
parameter b=2 km s^-1. Only a single strong H_2 absorber was found -- a system
detected previously in VLT/UVES spectra. Given our distribution of N(H_2) upper
limits, this ~1% detection rate is smaller than expected from previous surveys
at 99.8% confidence. Assuming the N(H_2) distribution shape from previous
surveys, our detection rate implies a covering factor of ~1% for N(H_2) >=
10^17.5 cm^-2 gas in DLAs (<6% at 95% confidence). We obtained new
Magellan/MagE spectra for 53 DLAs; 8 km s^-1 -resolution spectra were available
for 27 DLAs. MagE's moderate resolution (~71 km s^-1) yields weaker N(H_2)
upper limits and makes them dependent on the assumed Doppler parameter. For
example, half the (relevant) previous H_2 detections have N(H_2) >= 10^18.1
cm^-2, a factor of just 3 higher than our median upper limit. Nevertheless,
several tests suggest our upper limits are accurate, and they would need to be
increased by 1.8 dex to bring our detection rate within 95% confidence of
previous surveys.

  (ITCS) 2014",,,,"cs.SI cs.DM cs.DS physics.soc-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Listing all triangles is a fundamental graph operation. Triangles can have
important interpretations in real-world graphs, especially social and other
interaction networks. Despite the lack of provably efficient (linear, or
slightly super-linear) worst-case algorithms for this problem, practitioners
run simple, efficient heuristics to find all triangles in graphs with millions
of vertices. How are these heuristics exploiting the structure of these special
graphs to provide major speedups in running time?
  We study one of the most prevalent algorithms used by practitioners. A
trivial algorithm enumerates all paths of length $2$, and checks if each such
path is incident to a triangle. A good heuristic is to enumerate only those
paths of length $2$ where the middle vertex has the lowest degree. It is easily
implemented and is empirically known to give remarkable speedups over the
trivial algorithm.
  We study the behavior of this algorithm over graphs with heavy-tailed degree
distributions, a defining feature of real-world graphs. The erased
configuration model (ECM) efficiently generates a graph with asymptotically
(almost) any desired degree sequence. We show that the expected running time of
this algorithm over the distribution of graphs created by the ECM is controlled
by the $\ell_{4/3}$-norm of the degree sequence. Norms of the degree sequence
are a measure of the heaviness of the tail, and it is precisely this feature
that allows non-trivial speedups of simple triangle enumeration algorithms. As
a corollary of our main theorem, we prove expected linear-time performance for
degree sequences following a power law with exponent $\alpha \geq 7/3$, and
non-trivial speedup whenever $\alpha \in (2,3)$.

The complicated changes of oscillation characters are shown to occur in the
transcendental regions around the spherically-deformed region. We find that
these critical changes of oscillation characters are explained by the level

To this end, we model the mapping from the high-dimensional SPD manifold to the

for a projection that yields a low-dimensional manifold with maximum
discriminative power encoded via an affinity-weighted similarity measure based
on metrics on the manifold. Learning can then be expressed as an optimization

shows that our approach leads to a significant accuracy gain over

statistical quantities such as quantiles with small amount of memory. In many
such applications, in fact, one needs to compute such statistical quantities
for each of a large number of groups, which additionally restricts the amount
of memory available for the stream for any particular group. We address this
challenge and introduce frugal streaming, that is algorithms that work with
tiny -- typically, sub-streaming -- amount of memory per group.
  We design a frugal algorithm that uses only one unit of memory per group to
compute a quantile for each group. For stochastic streams where data items are
drawn from a distribution independently, we analyze and show that the algorithm
finds an approximation to the quantile rapidly and remains stably close to it.
We also propose an extension of this algorithm that uses two units of memory
per group. We show with extensive experiments with real world data from HTTP
trace and Twitter that our frugal algorithms are comparable to existing
streaming algorithms for estimating any quantile, but these existing algorithms
use far more space per group and are unrealistic in frugal applications;
further, the two memory frugal algorithm converges significantly faster than
the one memory algorithm.

surface modes indicated by the bulk-boundary correspondence in topological

much easily excited by an impurity when the Zeeman magnetic field increases
within the topological number to be unchanged. Thus, we obtain insights into
the robustness of a topological superconductor against non-magnetic impurities.
Moreover, we derive an effective theory applicable to high magnetic fields. The

a general trend for sources with more luminous 6.7-GHz methanol masers to be
associated with more luminous water maser emission. We have inspected the
GLIMPSE three colour images of the regions surrounding the masers and
cross-matched the maser positions with existing catalogues of Extended Green

where both methanol and water masers are present than at sites with only
methanol masers, but no significant difference in the fraction embedded within
Infrared Dark Clouds. Analysis of the 1.1-mm dust emission shows dust clumps
associated with masers that have greater flux densities and higher column
densities than those without. Dust clumps associated with both water and
6.7-GHz methanol masers are generally the most compact clumps followed by those
associated with only methanol then the clumps without associated maser

often older than those with only methanol, however, we suggest that the
evolutionary phase traced by water masers is not as well defined as for 6.7-GHz

from free filled states of the negative energy continuum as well as that from a
bound unfilled state, which can emerge in the above background due to the

quantitative modeling in systems biology can be compromised, especially at the
subcellular scale. One way to get around this is qualitative modeling because
it requires few to no quantitative information. One of the most popular
qualitative modeling approaches is the Boolean network formalism. However,
Boolean models allow variables to take only two values, which can be too
simplistic in some cases. The present work proposes a modeling approach derived
from Boolean networks where continuous logical operators are used and where
edges can be tuned. Using continuous logical operators allows variables to be
more finely valued while remaining qualitative. To consider that some
biological interactions can be slower or weaker than other ones, edge states
are also computed in order to modulate in speed and strength the signal they
convey. The proposed formalism is illustrated on a toy network coming from the
epidermal growth factor receptor signaling pathway. The obtained simulations
show that continuous results are produced, thus allowing finer analysis. The
simulations also show that modulating the signal conveyed by the edges allows
to incorporate knowledge about the interactions they model. The goal is to
provide enhancements in the ability of qualitative models to simulate the
dynamics of biological networks while limiting the need of quantitative
information.

elements, while non-covariant at finite mass, is successful in the heavy quark
limit : form factors are covariant and satisfy Isgur-Wise scaling and
Bjorken-Uraltsev sum rules. Motivated by the so-called ""1/2 vs. 3/2 puzzle"" in
B decays to positive parity D**, we examine the implications of the model at
finite mass. In the elastic case 1/2^- -> 1/2^-, the HQET constraints for the
O(1/m_Q) corrections are analytically fulfilled. A number of satisfying
regularities is also found for inelastic transitions. We compute the form
factors using the wave functions given by the Godfrey-Isgur potential. For
1/2^- \to 3/2^+ the departures from the heavy quark limit are small, but we
find a strong enhancement in 1/2^- -> 1/2^+ (for 0^- -> 0^+). This enhancement
is linked to a serious difficulty of the model at finite mass for the inelastic
transitions, namely a violation of the HQET constraints at zero recoil
formulated by Leibovich et al. These are nevertheless satisfied in the
non-relativistic limit for the light quark. We conclude that these HQET
rigorous constraints are crucial in the construction of a sensible relativistic
quark model of inelastic form factors.

detect 11.3$\mu$m PAH feature emission in the nuclear regions of the galaxies
as well as extended PAH emission over a few hundred parsecs. The equivalent
width (EW) of the feature shows a minimum at the nucleus but increases with
increasing radial distances, reaching typical star-forming values a few hundred
parsecs away from the nucleus. The reduced nuclear EW are interpreted as due to
increased dilution from the AGN continuum rather than destruction of the PAH
molecules. We conclude that at least those molecules responsible for the
11.3$\mu$m PAH feature survive in the nuclear environments as close as 10pc
from the AGN and for Seyfert-like AGN luminosities. We propose that material in
the dusty tori, nuclear gas disks, and/or host galaxies of AGN is likely to

which {\it conserve momentum} is typically thought to proceed anomalously.
Notable exceptions, however, exist of which the rotator model is a prominent
case. Therefore, the quest arises to identify the origin of manifest anomalous
transport in those low dimensional systems. Here, we develop the theory for
both, momentum/heat diffusion and its corresponding momentum/heat transport. We
demonstrate that the second temporal derivative of the mean squared deviation
of the momentum spread is proportional to the equilibrium correlation of the
total momentum flux. This result in turn relates, via the integrated momentum
flux correlation, to an effective viscosity, or equivalently, to the underlying
momentum diffusivity. We put forward the intriguing hypothesis that a
fluid-like momentum dynamics with a {\it finite viscosity} causes {\it normal}
heat transport; its corollary being that superdiffusive momentum diffusion with
an intrinsic {\it diverging viscosity} in turn yields {\it anomalous} heat
transport. This very hypothesis is corroborated over wide extended time scales
by use of precise molecular dynamics simulations. The numerical validation of
the hypothesis involves three distinct archetype classes of nonlinear
pair-interaction potentials: (i) a globally bounded pair interaction (the noted
rotator model), (ii) unbounded interactions acting at large distances (the
Fermi-Pasta-Ulam $\beta$ model, or the rotator model amended with harmonic pair
interactions) and (iii), a pair interaction potential being unbounded at short
distances while displaying an asymptotic free part (Lennard-Jones model).

reshaping the vector of diagonal elements of $U$ of length $N^2$ into a square

the forward transition vector field is more and more centripetal as the
stability of the system increasing; (2) In the individual behavior of strategy
transit view, there exists a phase transformation as the stability of the
systems increasing, and the phase transformation point being near the standard
RPS; (3) Conditional response behaviors are structurally changing accompanied
by the controlled incentive. As a whole, the best response behavior increases
and the win-stay lose-shift (WSLS) behavior declines with the incentive.
Further, the outcome of win, tie, and lose influence the best response behavior

declines with the incentive while the lose-left-shift behavior increase with

  material with Rashba Hamiltonian",,,,,"cond-mat.mes-hall","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  An appearance of a direct current perpendicularly to a constant component of
an electric field in material with Rashba Hamiltonian under the influence of an
elliptically polarized wave is investigated in one-subband approximation. On
its physical nature this effect is close to a circular photogalvanic effect
(CPGE) on intraband transitions. The effect is studied on the base of two
approaches: investigations of Boltzmann kinetic equation in a constant
collision frequency approximation and semiclassical Monte Carlo simulations,
which immediately takes into account microscopic processes of charge carriers
scattering on optical and acoustical phonons. Monte Carlo modelling allows us
to determine a mean relaxation time and its dependencies on electric field
strengths and on the energy of optical phonons. On the base of these
estimations a possibility of using a constant relaxation time approximation is
justified. It is confirmed that the main contribution to the effects of
transverse rectification is made by inelastic scattering of electrons on
optical phonons. A comparison of results of Monte Carlo simulations and
calculations on the base of a constant collision frequency approximation is
presented.

200 mum, and the reflectance between 0.3 and about 300 mum. We show here how,
using recent developments of the electron theory of graphene, extended to

1000 mum, in effect all the way to Direct Current. The plasma frequency as well
as the scattering rate of free electrons are shown to both decrease with T, but
level off near 0 K, in agreement with theory. Along the way, we noticed
significant discrepancies with the well-known and often used derivation of
Philipp (1977) at room temperature, and also with previous data on temperature

automorphy are investigated in this paper. Both of them are related to
nilsystems.
  In the first part, the problem which can be viewed as the higher order
version of an old question concerning Bohr sets is studied: for any $d\in
{\mathbb N}$ does the collection of $\{n\in {\mathbb Z}: S\cap
(S-n)\cap\ldots\cap (S-dn)\neq \emptyset\}$ with $S$ syndetic coincide with
that of Nil$_d$ Bohr$_0$-sets? It is proved that Nil$_d$ Bohr$_0$-sets could be
characterized via generalized polynomials, and applying this result one side of
the problem is answered affirmatively: for any Nil$_d$ Bohr$_0$-set $A$, there
exists a syndetic set $S$ such that $A\supset \{n\in {\mathbb Z}: S\cap
(S-n)\cap\ldots\cap (S-dn)\neq \emptyset\}.$ Moreover, it is shown that the
answer of the other side of the problem can be deduced from some result by
Bergelson-Host-Kra if modulo a set with zero density.
  In the second part, the notion of $d$-step almost automorphic systems with
$d\in{\mathbb N}\cup\{\infty\}$ is introduced and investigated, which is the
generalization of the classical almost automorphic ones. It is worth to mention
that some results concerning higher order Bohr sets will be applied to the
investigation. For a minimal topological dynamical system $(X,T)$ it is shown
that the condition $x\in X$ is $d$-step almost automorphic can be characterized
via various subsets of ${\mathbb Z}$ including the dual sets of $d$-step
Poincar\'e and Birkhoff recurrence sets, and Nil$_d$ Bohr$_0$-sets. Moreover,
it turns out that the condition $(x,y)\in X\times X$ is regionally proximal of

Euclidean space, when data are sparse but a slow variation allows for a useful
fit. We measure the variation by Lipschitz Bound (LB). Functions which admit
smaller LB are considered to vary more slowly. Since most functions in practice
are wiggly and do not admit a small LB, we extend this framework by
approximating a wiggly function, f, by ones which admit a smaller LB and do not
deviate from f by more than a specified Bound Deviation (BD). In fact for any
positive LB, one can find such a BD, thus defining a trade-off function (LB-BD
function) between the variation measure (LB) and the deviation measure (BD). We
show that the LB-BD function satisfies nice properties: it is non-increasing
and convex. We also present a method to obtain it using convex optimization.
For a function with given LB and BD, we find the optimal fit and present
deterministic bounds for the prediction error of various methods. Given the
LB-BD function, we discuss picking an appropriate LB-BD pair for fitting and
calculating the prediction errors. The developed methods can naturally
accommodate an extra assumption of periodicity to obtain better prediction
errors. Finally we present the application of this framework to air pollution
data with sparse observations over time.

strong response to plasma rotation or any small background electrostatic field
in the plasma, such as that generated by anisotropic external heating. These
forces lead to strong poloidal asymmetries of impurity density, which have
recently been added to numerical tools describing both neoclassical and
turbulent transport. Modelling predictions of the steady-state two-dimensional
tungsten impurity distribution are compared with experimental densities
interpreted from soft X-ray diagnostics. The modelling identifies neoclassical
transport enhanced by poloidal asymmetries as the dominant mechanism

Depending on the bulk plasma profiles, neoclassical temperature screening can
prevent accumulation, and can be enhanced by externally heated species,
demonstrated here in ICRH plasmas.

the average density $\rho$ is increased, the system displays first a transition
from a fluid to a bcc phase, and subsequently to hcp and fcc phases. In the
inhomogeneous region, the behavior is that found in previous investigations of
this class of cluster-forming potentials. Specifically, the particles arrange
into clusters strongly localized at the lattice sites, and the lattice constant
depends very weakly on $\rho$, leading to an occupancy number of the sites
which is a nearly linear function of $\rho$. These results are compared to
those predicted by the more widespread approach, in which the DFT minimization
is carried out by representing the density profile by a given functional form

non-relativistic Lifshitz holography in the framework of the
Ho\v{r}ava-Lifshitz (HL) theory of gravity, which naturally contains high-order
operators in order for the theory to be power-counting renormalizble, and
provides an ideal place for such studies. In particular, we show that the
Lifshitz space-time is still a solution of the full theory of the HL gravity.
The effects of the high-oder operators on the space-time itself is simply to
shift the Lifshitz dynamical exponent. However, while in the infrared the
asymptotic behavior of a (probe) scalar field near the boundary is similar to
that studied in the literature, it gets dramatically modified in the UV limit,
because of the presence of the high-order operators in this regime. Then,
according to the gauge/gravity duality, this in turn affects the two-point
correlation functions.

last decade for the parallel solution of evolution problems. They are based on
a decomposition in space and an iteration, where only subproblems in space-time
need to be solved. Each subproblem can be simulated using an adapted numerical
method, for example with local time stepping, or one can even use a different
model in different subdomains, which makes these methods very suitable also
from a modeling point of view. For rapid convergence however, it is important
to use effective transmission conditions between the space-time subdomains, and
for best performance, these transmission conditions need to take the physics of
the underlying evolution problem into account. The optimization of these
transmission conditions leads to a mathematically hard best approximation
problem of homographic type. We study in this paper in detail this problem for
the case of linear advection reaction diffusion equations in two spatial
dimensions. We prove comprehensively best approximation results for
transmission conditions of Robin and Ventcel type. We give for each case closed

performance of the iterative methods. We finally show extensive numerical

generally converge in law on the space $\mathcal {C}([0,1]^d)$ of continuous

show that the process converges in $\mathcal{C}(K)$ for any compact

whose complement is the Cartesian product of the ranges of the marginal
distribution functions. This result is sufficient to deduce the weak limit of
many functionals of the process, including classical statistics for monotone
trend. It also leads to a powerful and consistent test of independence which is
applicable even to sparse contingency tables whose dimension is sample size

The brightest representatives are granular light bridges composed of features
that appear to be similar to granules. An in-depth study of the convective
motions, temperature stratification, and magnetic field vector in and around
light bridge granules is presented with the aim of identifying similarities and
differences to typical quiet-Sun granules. Spectropolarimetric data from the
Hinode Solar Optical Telescope were analyzed using a spatially coupled
inversion technique to retrieve the stratified atmospheric parameters of light
bridge and quiet-Sun granules. Central hot upflows surrounded by cooler fast
downflows reaching 10 km/s clearly establish the convective nature of the light
bridge granules. The inner part of these granules in the near surface layers is
field free and is covered by a cusp-like magnetic field configuration. We
observe hints of field reversals at the location of the fast downflows. The
quiet-Sun granules in the vicinity of the sunspot are covered by a low-lying
canopy field extending radially outward from the spot. The similarities between
quiet-Sun and light bridge granules point to the deep anchoring of granular
light bridges in the underlying convection zone. The fast, supersonic downflows
are most likely a result of a combination of invigorated convection in the
light bridge granule due to radiative cooling into the neighboring umbra and
the fact that we sample deeper layers, since the downflows are immediately
adjacent to the slanted walls of the Wilson depression.

natural generalizations to arbitrary dimensions of the well known one
dimensional East process. These facilitated models are supposed to catch some
of the main features of the complex dynamics of fragile glasses. We focus on
the low temperature regime (small density $c \approx e^{-\beta}$ of the
facilitating sites). In the literature the relaxation process for the above
models has been assumed to be quasi-one dimensional and, in particular, their
equilibration time has been computed using the relaxation time of the East
model ($d=1$) on the equilibrium length scale $L_c=(1/c)^{1/d}$ in
$d$-dimension. This led to the derivation of a super-Arrhenius scaling for the
relaxation time of the form $T_{\rm rel} \asymp \exp(\beta^2/d\log 2)$. In a
companion paper, using mainly renormalization group ideas and electrical
networks methods, we rigorously establish that instead $T_{\rm rel} \asymp
\exp(\beta^2/2d\log 2)$, a result showing that the relaxation process cannot be
quasi-one-dimensional. The above scaling sharply confirms previous MCAMC (Monte
Carlo with Absorbing Markov Chains) simulations. Next we compute the relaxation
time at finite and mesoscopic length scales, and show a dramatic dependence on
the boundary conditions, yet another indication of key dimensional effects. Our
final result is related to the out-of-equilibrium dynamics. Starting with a
single facilitating site at the origin we show that, up to length scales
$L=O(L_c)$, its influence propagates much faster (on a logarithmic scale) along
the diagonal direction than along the axes directions. Such unexpected result
is due to a rather delicate balance between dynamical energy barriers and
entropic effects in the constrained dynamics.

discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method for the solution of the two dimensional
incompressible Navier-Stokes equations on staggered unstructured curved meshes.
While the discrete pressure is defined on the primal grid, the discrete
velocity vector field is defined on an edge-based dual grid. The flexibility of
high order DG methods on curved unstructured meshes allows to discretize even
complex physical domains on rather coarse grids.
  Formal substitution of the discrete momentum equation into the discrete
continuity equation yields one sparse block four-diagonal linear equation
system for only one scalar unknown, namely the pressure. The method is
computationally efficient, since the resulting system is not only very sparse
but also symmetric and positive definite for appropriate boundary conditions.
Furthermore, all the volume and surface integrals needed by the scheme
presented in this paper depend only on the geometry and the polynomial degree
of the basis and test functions and can therefore be precomputed and stored in
a preprocessor stage, which leads to savings in terms of computational effort
for the time evolution part. In this way also the extension to a fully curved
isoparametric approach becomes natural and affects only the preprocessing step.
The method is validated for polynomial degrees up to $p=3$ by solving some
typical numerical test problems and comparing the numerical results with
available analytical solutions or other numerical and experimental reference
data.

propose an exact algorithm for the maximum clique problem based on the Russian

the Russian Dolls method is that the nodes of its search tree correspond to
decision subproblems, instead of the optimization subproblems of the Branch and
Bound method. In comparison to a first implementation of this Russian Dolls
method from the literature, several improvements are presented. Some of them
are adaptations of techniques already employed successfully in Branch and Bound
algorithms, like the use of approximate coloring for pruning purposes and
bit-parallel operations. Two different coloring heuristics are tested: the
standard greedy and the greedy with recoloring. Other improvements are directly
related to the Russian Dolls scheme: the adoption of recursive calls where each
subproblem (doll) is solved itself via the same principles than the Russian
Dolls Search and the application of an elimination rule allowing not to
generate a significant number of dolls. Results of computational experiments
show that the algorithm outperforms the best exact combinatorial algorithms in

for examining whether two data sets are generated from the same distribution or
not. It is also used to determine how well a specified probability distribution
fits a given sample. In this article, we develop and study a multivariate
version of the Q-Q plot based on the spatial quantile. The usefulness of the
proposed graphical device is illustrated on different real and simulated data,
some of which have fairly large dimensions. We also develop certain statistical
tests that are related to the proposed multivariate Q-Q plot and study their
asymptotic properties. The performance of those tests are compared with that of
some other well-known tests for multivariate distributions available in the
literature.

disk object: 2007UK126; and two resonant objects: 2007TY430 and 2000EB173, or
Huya. For each target, possible rotational periods and/or photometric
amplitudes are reported. We also derived some physical properties from their
lightcurves, such as density, primary and secondary sizes, and albedo. We
compiled and analyzed a vast lightcurve database for Trans-Neptunian Objects
(TNOs) including centaurs to determine the lightcurve amplitude and spin
frequency distributions for the binary and non-binary populations. The mean
rotational periods, from the Maxwellian fits to the frequency distributions,
are 8.63+/-0.52 h for the entire sample, 8.37+/-0.58 h for the sample without
the binary population, and 10.11+/-1.19 h for the binary population alone.
Because the centaurs are collisionally more evolved, their rotational periods
might not be so primordial. We computed a mean rotational period, from the
Maxwellian fit, of 8.86+/-0.58 h for the sample without the centaur population,
and of 8.64+/-0.67 h considering a sample without the binary and the centaur
populations. According to this analysis, regular TNOs spin faster than
binaries, which is compatible with the tidal interaction of the binaries.
Finally, we examined possible formation models for several systems studied in
this work and by our team in previous papers.

materials that can be used to realize two-dimensional (2D) crystals possessing
rather unique transport and optical properties. Most research has so far
focused on sulfur and selenium compounds, while tellurium-based materials
attracted little attention so far. As a first step in the investigation of
Te-based semiconducting TMDs in this context, we have studied MoTe$_2$ crystals
with thicknesses above 4 nm, focusing on surface transport and a quantitative
determination of the gap structure. Using ionic-liquid gated transistors, we
show that ambipolar transport at the surface of the material is reproducibly
achieved, with hole and electron mobility values between 10 and 30 cm$^2$/Vs at
room temperature. The gap structure is determined through three different
techniques: ionic-liquid gated transistors and scanning tunneling spectroscopy,
that allow the measurement of the indirect gap ($E_{ind}$), and optical
transmission spectroscopy on crystals of different thickness, that enables the
determination of both the direct ($E_{dir}$) and the indirect gap. We find that
at room temperature $E_{ind}$ = 0.88 eV and $E_{dir}$ = 1.02 eV. Our results
suggest that thin MoTe$_2$ layers may exhibit a transition to a direct gap
before mono-layer thickness. They should also drastically extend the range of
direct gaps accessible in 2D semiconducting TMDs.

flows are undamped to lowest order in an expansion in the normalized Larmor
radius. However, perfect quasisymmetry is impossible. Since large flows may be
desirable as a means to reduce turbulent transport, it is important to know
when a stellarator can be considered to be sufficiently close to quasisymmetry.
The answer to this question depends strongly on the size of the spatial
gradients of the deviation from quasisymmetry and on the collisionality regime.
Recently, formal criteria for closeness to quasisymmetry have been derived in a
variety of situations. In particular, the case of deviations with large
gradients was solved in the $1/\nu$ regime. Denoting by $\alpha$ a parameter
that gives the size of the deviation from quasisymmetry, it was proven that
particle fluxes do not scale with $\alpha^{3/2}$, as typically claimed, but
with $\alpha$. It was also shown that ripple wells are not necessarily the main
cause of transport. This paper reviews those works and presents a new result in
another collisionality regime, in which particles trapped in ripple wells are
collisional and the rest are collisionless.

HC$_3$N ($J=5-4$), N$_2$H$^+$ ($J=1-0$), and SiO ($J=2-1, v=0$) observations,

protocluster clump. We emphasize that Serpens South is the first
cluster-forming region where extremely-strong CCS emission is detected. The
CCS-to-N$_2$H$^+$ abundance ratio is estimated to be about 0.5 toward the
protocluster clump, whereas it is about 3 in the other parts of the main
filament. We identify six dense ridges with different $V_{\rm LSR}$. These
ridges appear to converge toward the protocluster clump, suggesting that the
collisions of these ridges may have triggered cluster formation. The collisions
presumably happened within a few $\times \ 10^5$ yr because CCS is abundant
only in such a short time. The short lifetime agrees with the fact that the
number fraction of Class I objects, whose typical lifetime is $0.4 \times \
10^5$ yr, is extremely high as about 70 percent in the protocluster clump. In
the northern part, two ridges appear to have partially collided, forming a
V-shape clump. In addition, we detected strong bipolar SiO emission that is due
to the molecular outflow blowing out of the protostellar clump, as well as
extended weak SiO emission that may originate from the filament collisions.

halo probability distribution function (PDF) encoding higher-order correlation
functions. We demonstrate that halo catalogues based on the same underlying
dark matter field with a fix halo number density, and accurately matching the
power spectrum (within 2%), can lead to very different bispectra depending on
the adopted halo bias model. A model ignoring the shape of the halo PDF can
lead to deviations up to factors of 2. The catalogues obtained additionally
constraining the shape of the halo PDF can significantly lower the discrepancy
in the three-point statistics, yielding closely unbiased bispectra both in real
and in redshift space; which are in general compatible with those corresponding
to an N-body simulation within 10% (deviating at most up to 20%). Our
calculations show that the constant linear bias of ~2 for Luminous Red Galaxy
(LRG) like galaxies seen in the power spectrum, mainly comes from sampling
halos in high density peaks, choosing a high density threshold rather than from
a factor multiplying the dark matter density field. Our method contributes
towards an efficient modelling of the halo/galaxy distribution required to
estimate uncertainties in the clustering measurements from galaxy redshift
surveys. We have also demonstrated that it represents a powerful tool to test
various bias models.

demanded by many interactive applications. To improve tail latency, existing
approaches require modifications to switch hardware and/or end-host operating
systems, making them difficult to be deployed. We present the design,
implementation, and evaluation of RepNet, an application layer transport that
can be deployed today. RepNet exploits the fact that only a few paths among
many are congested at any moment in the network, and applies simple flow
replication to mice flows to opportunistically use the less congested path.
RepNet has two designs for flow replication: (1) RepSYN, which only replicates
SYN packets and uses the first connection that finishes TCP handshaking for
data transmission, and (2) RepFlow which replicates the entire mice flow. We
implement RepNet on {\tt node.js}, one of the most commonly used platforms for
networked interactive applications. {\tt node}'s single threaded event-loop and
non-blocking I/O make flow replication highly efficient. Performance evaluation
on a real network testbed and in Mininet reveals that RepNet is able to reduce
the tail latency of mice flows, as well as application completion times, by
more than 50\%.

using synchronization mechanisms such as monitors or channels. The connection
between these mechanisms and the resources they protect is, however, only given
implicitly; this makes it difficult both for programmers to apply the
mechanisms correctly and for compilers to check that resources are properly
protected. This paper presents a mechanism to automatically check that shared
memory is accessed properly, using a methodology called shared ownership. In
contrast to traditional ownership, shared ownership offers more flexibility by
permitting multiple owners of a resource. On the basis of this methodology, we
define an abstract model of resource access that provides operations to manage
data dependencies, as well as sharing and transfer of access privileges. The
model is rigorously defined using a formal semantics, and shown to be free from
data races. This property can be used to detect unsafe memory accesses when
simulating the model together with the execution of a program. The
expressiveness and efficiency of the approach is demonstrated on a variety of
programs using common synchronization mechanisms.

deforming its frame changes topology to that of a disk through a

catenoid, which transitions to two disks through a bulk singularity. It is not
yet understood whether the type of singularity is generally a consequence of
the surface topology, nor how this dependence could arise from an equation of
motion for the surface. To address these questions we investigate
experimentally, computationally, and theoretically the route to singularities
of soap films with different topologies, including a family of punctured Klein
bottles. We show that the location of singularities (bulk or boundary) may
depend on the path of the boundary deformation. In the unstable regime the
driving force for soap-film motion is the mean curvature. Thus, the narrowest
part of the neck, associated with the shortest nontrivial closed geodesic of
the surface, has the highest curvature and is the fastest-moving. Just before
onset of the instability there exists on the stable surface a shortest closed
geodesic, which is the initial condition for evolution of the neck's geodesics,
all of which have the same topological relationship to the frame. We make the
plausible conjectures that if the initial geodesic is linked to the boundary
then the singularity will occur at the boundary, whereas if the two are
unlinked initially then the singularity will occur in the bulk. Numerical study
of mean curvature flows and experiments support these conjectures.

models is an important problem in many branches of science. Using the dynamic
cavity method on time trajectories, we construct a general procedure for
deriving the dynamic message-passing equations for a large class of models with
unidirectional dynamics, which includes the zero-temperature random field Ising
model, the susceptible-infected-recovered model, and rumor spreading models. We
show that unidirectionality of the dynamics is the key ingredient that makes
the problem solvable. These equations are applicable to single instances of the
corresponding problems with arbitrary initial conditions, and are
asymptotically exact for problems defined on locally tree-like graphs. When
applied to real-world networks, they generically provide a good analytic
approximation of the real dynamics.

in the kinetic term of the Einstein-Hilbert action, leading to a one-parameter
family of classical theories. Performing a canonical constraint analysis for
closed spatial hypersurfaces, we obtain a result analogous to that of Bellorin
and Restuccia, who showed that all non-projectable lambda-R models are
equivalent to general relativity in the asymptotically flat case. However, the
tertiary constraint present for closed boundary conditions assumes a more
general form. We juxtapose this with an earlier finding by Giulini and Kiefer,
who ruled out a range of lambda-R models by a physical, cosmological argument.
We show that their analysis can be interpreted consistently within the

present paper, we devote ourselves to test whether the speed of light is
varying from the observational data of the type Ia Supernova, Baryon Acoustic
Oscillation, Observational $H(z)$ data and Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB).
We select the common form $c(t)=c_0a^n(t)$ with the contribution of dark energy
and matter, where $c_0$ is the current value of speed of light, $n$ is a
constant, and consequently construct a varying speed of light dark energy model
(VSLDE). The combined observational data show a much trivial constraint
$n=-0.0033 \pm 0.0045$ at 68.3\% confidence level, which indicates that the
speed of light may be a constant with high significance. By reconstructing the
time-variable $c(t)$, we find that the speed of light almost has no variation
for redshift $z < 10^{-1}$. For high-$z$ observations, they are more sensitive
to the VSLDE model, but the variation of speed of light is only in order of
$10^{-2}$. We also introduce the geometrical diagnostic $Om (z)$ to show the
difference between the VSLDE and $\Lambda$CDM model. The result shows that the
current data are difficult to differentiate them. All the results show that the
observational data favor the constant speed of light.

records of daily vehicle mobility based on GPS positioning device installed in

Using the mapping from the degree of congestion on roads into a time series of
symbols and measuring its entropy, we find a relatively high daily
predictability of traffic conditions despite the absence of any a priori
knowledge of drivers' origins and destinations and quite different travel
patterns between weekdays and weekends. Moreover, we find a counterintuitive
dependence of the predictability on travel speed: the road segment associated
with intermediate average travel speed is most difficult to be predicted. We
also explore the possibility of recovering the traffic condition of an
inaccessible segment from its adjacent segments with respect to limited
observability. The highly predictable traffic patterns in spite of the
heterogeneity of drivers' behaviors and the variability of their origins and
destinations enables development of accurate predictive models for eventually
devising practical strategies to mitigate urban road congestion.

crystallography is valid for very small crystals or those like crystalized
biomolecules with small coherent subunits. But in the general case, it fails to
model the integrated intensities of diffraction spots, and cannot even find the
size of the crystal. The more rigorous and less employed alternative is a
purely-classical crystal-specific model, which bypasses the fundamental notion
of bulk and hence the non-classical X-ray scattering from bulk. This
contribution is Part 1 out of two reports, in which we seek to clarify the
assumptions of some different regimes and models of X-ray scattering and their

single particles) are contrasted, and the terminology conflict regarding

scattering, Part 2 will focus on additional concepts, limitations, correction

information, and what model can retrieve it. This contribution is Part 2 out of
two reports, in which we seek to clarify the assumptions of some different
regimes and models of X-ray scattering and their implications for single
particle imaging. In Part 1, basic concepts and existing scattering models
along with their implications for nanocrystals, and also the misconception of
using Diffraction Theory for volumetric scattering were addressed. Here in Part
2, specific challenges ahead of single particle imaging are addressed.
Limitations of the conventional scattering model in the test case of a sphere,
schemes for improving this common scattering model, ambiguities in meaning and
properties of ""density map"" and non-classical effects, the crucial role of
electromagnetic boundary conditions, the uniqueness of X-ray scattering inverse
problems, and additional vulnerabilities of phase retrieval and its relation
with ""resolution"" are discussed. We raise concerns about the unverified use of
the common scattering model of protein crystallography for arbitrary objects,
and also leaving fundamental questions such as meaning/uniqueness/properties of
the sought 3D profiles to phase retrieval algorithms.

dimensional space in which the Poisson bracket among the coordinates is that of
the SU(2) Lie algebra. In particular it is shown that among problems with
spherically symmetric potential energies, it is only the Kepler problem for
which all of the bounded orbits are closed. In analogy with the case of the
ordinary space, a conserved vector (apart from the angular momentum) is
explicitly constructed, which is responsible for the orbits being closed. This
is the analog of the Laplace-Runge-Lenz vector. The algebra of the constants of
the motion is also worked out.
