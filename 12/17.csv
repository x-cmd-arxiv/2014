the transport experiments in the quantum Hall liquid at filling factor
$\nu=5/2$. The 113 order, however, cannot be easily distinguished from other
likely topological orders at $\nu=5/2$ such as the non-Abelian Pfaffian and
anti-Pfaffian states and the Abelian Halperin 331 state in Fabry-Perot
interferometry. We show that an electronic Mach-Zehnder interferometer provides
a clear identification of these candidate $\nu=5/2$ states. Specifically, the
$I$-$V$ curve for the tunneling current through the interferometer is more
asymmetric in the 113 state than in other $\nu=5/2$ states. Moreover, the Fano
factor for the shot noise in the interferometer can reach 13.6 in the 113
state, much greater than the maximum Fano factors of 3.2 in the Pfaffian and
anti-Pfaffian states and 2.3 in the 331 state.

are the most promising candidates to overcome this limit, providing magnetic
memory bits with small volumes, low coercivity and high thermal stability at
the same time. Combining micromagnetic simulations with forward flux sampling
(FFS), a computational method for rare events that has been recently applied to
the magnetic nanostructures, we have determined thermal escape rates and
attempt frequencies of a graded media grain and two single phase grains of the

stability of a grain by 12 orders of magnitudes from tens of milliseconds to
centuries without changing the coercive field.

in microtubules is not a first-order process, as is usually assumed. Recent
{\it in vitro} observations by Gardner et al.[ M. K. Gardner et al., Cell
{\bf147}, 1092 (2011)] showed that microtubule catastrophe takes place via
multiple steps and the frequency increases with the age of the filament. Here,
we investigate, via numerical simulations and mathematical calculations, some
of the consequences of age dependence of catastrophe on the dynamics of
microtubules as a function of the aging rate, for two different models of
aging: exponential growth, but saturating asymptotically and purely linear
growth. The boundary demarcating the steady state and non-steady state regimes
in the dynamics is derived analytically in both cases. Numerical simulations,
supported by analytical calculations in the linear model, show that aging leads
to non-exponential length distributions in steady state. More importantly,
oscillations ensue in microtubule length and velocity. The regularity of
oscillations, as characterized by the negative dip in the autocorrelation
function, is reduced by increasing the frequency of rescue events. Our study
shows that age dependence of catastrophe could function as an intrinsic
mechanism to generate oscillatory dynamics in a microtubule population,
distinct from hitherto identified ones.

the preceding asymtotic giant branch (AGB) phase these stars are heavily

morphology of the circumstellar environments of AGB stars we observe the
closest carbon-rich AGB star IRC+10216 in scattered light. When imaged in
scattered light at optical wavelengths, IRC+10216 surprisingly shows a narrow
equatorial density enhancement, in contrast to the large-scale spherical rings
that have been imaged much further out. We use radiative transfer models to
interpret this structure in terms of two models: firstly, an equatorial density
enhancement, commonly observed in the more evolved post-AGB stars, and
secondly, in terms of a dust rings model, where a local enhancement of
mass-loss creates a spiral ring as the star rotates. We conclude that both
models can be used to reproduce the dark lane in the scattered light images,
which is caused by an equatorially density enhancement formed by dense dust
rather than a bipolar outflow as previously thought. We are unable to place
constraints on the formation of the equatorial density enhancement by a binary
system.

a typical example of multi criteria group decision-making problem. The
conventional crisp techniques has not much effective for solving MCDM problems
because of imprecise or fuzziness nature of the linguistic assessments. To find
the exact values for MCDM problems is both difficult and impossible in more
cases in real world. So, it is more reasonable to consider the values of
alternatives according to the criteria as single valued neutrosophic sets
(SVNS). This paper deal with the technique for order preference by similarity

problem with single valued neutrosophic information. The value of each
alternative and the weight of each criterion are characterized by single valued
neutrosophic numbers. Here, the importance of criteria and alternatives is
identified by aggregating individual opinions of decision makers (DMs) via

consistency of hashes generated from each tree for the same class data, i.e.,
to preserve the underlying similarity, and it also lacks a principled way for

independently trained random trees in a forest are acting as hashing functions.
We the propose a subspace model as the splitting function, and show that it
enforces the hash consistency in a tree for data from the same class. We also
introduce an information-theoretic approach for aggregating codes of individual
trees into a single hash code, producing a near-optimal unique hash for each

the proposed approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art hashing

provide the Lenzen-derivative properties that must be imposed on finite

The
inflation is driven by the phase component of a complex field along helical
trajectory. The helicoid structure originates from the monodromy of
superpotential with an singularity at origin.
  We show that such monodromy can be formed by integrating out heavy fields in
supersymmetric field theory. The supergravity corrections to the potential
provide strong field stabilizations for the scalars except inflaton, therefore
the helical phase inflation accomplishes the ""monodromy inflation"" within
supersymmetric field theory.
  The phase monodromy can be easily generalized for natural inflation, in which
the super-Planckian phase decay constant is realized with consistent field
stabilization. The phase-axion alignment is fulfilled indirectly in the process
of integrating out the heavy fields.
  Besides, we show that the helical phase inflation can be naturally realized
in no-scale supergravity with $SU(2,1)/SU(2)\times U(1)$ symmetry since the
no-scale K\""ahler potential provides symmetry factors of phase monodromy
directly. We also demonstrate that the helical phase inflation can reduce to
the shift symmetry realization of supergravity inflation. The super-Planckian
field excursion is accomplished by the phase component, which admits no
dangerous polynomial higher order corrections. The helical phase inflation
process is free from the UV-sensitivity problem, and it suggests that inflation
can be effectively studied in supersymmetric field theory close to the
unification scale in Grand Unified Theory and a UV-completed frame is not
prerequisite.

tilt angle using Mount Wilson magnetograms from 1974-2012. The magnetograms
allowed for BMR tilt angles that were anti-Hale in configuration, so tilt
values ranged from 0 to 360{\deg} rather than the more common $\pm$ 90{\deg}.
We explore the visual representation of magnetic tilt angles on a traditional
butterfly diagram by plotting the mean area-weighted latitude of umbral
activity in each bipolar sunspot group, including tilt information. The large
scatter of tilt angles over the course of a single cycle and hemisphere
prevents Joy's law from being visually identified in the tilt-butterfly diagram
without further binning. The average latitude of anti-Hale regions does not
differ from the average latitude of all regions in both hemispheres. The
distribution of anti-Hale sunspot tilt angles are broadly distributed between 0
and 360{\deg} with a weak preference for east-west alignment 180{\deg} from
their expected Joy's law angle. The anti-Hale sunspots display a log-normal
size distribution similar to that of all sunspots, indicating no preferred size
for anti-Hale sunspots. We report that 8.4% $\pm$ 0.8% of all bipolar sunspot
regions are misclassified as Hale in traditional catalogs. This percentage is
slightly higher for groups within 5{\deg} of the equator due to the

visual classification tasks. With the exception of ImageNet, these datasets are
carefully crafted such that objects are well-aligned at similar scales.
Naturally, the feature learning problem gets more challenging as the amount of
variation in the data increases, as the models have to learn to be invariant to
certain changes in appearance. Recent results on the ImageNet dataset show that
given enough data, ConvNets can learn such invariances producing very
discriminative features [1]. But could we do more: use less parameters, less
data, learn more discriminative features, if certain invariances were built
into the learning process? In this paper we present a simple model that allows
ConvNets to learn features in a locally scale-invariant manner without
increasing the number of model parameters. We show on a modified MNIST dataset
that when faced with scale variation, building in scale-invariance allows
ConvNets to learn more discriminative features with reduced chances of
over-fitting.

positive, being a sum of positive terms. There are zeros, however, on the
complex beta plane that are called Fisher zeros. In the thermodynamic limit,
the Fisher zeros coalesce into continuous curves. In case there is a phase
transition, the zeros tend to pinch the real-beta axis. For an ideal trapped
Bose gas in an isotropic three-dimensional harmonic oscillator, this tendency
is clearly seen, signalling Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC). The calculation
can be formulated exactly in terms of the virial expansion with
temperature-dependent virial coefficients. When the second virial coefficient
of a strongly interacting attractive unitary gas is included in the
calculation, BEC seems to survive, with the condensation temperature shifted to
a lower value for the unitary gas. This shift is consistent with a direct
calculation of the heat capacity from the canonical partition function of the
ideal and the unitary gas.

results for VY CMa represent the most stringent constraints to date on the
magnetic field strength near the surface of a hypergiant. VY CMa's mass loss is
episodic and may have been in a state of low surface magnetic activity during
the XMM observations. The XMM observations also yield detections of more than
100 X-ray sources within $\sim$15$^{\prime}$ of VY CMa, roughly 50 of which

na\""{i}ve one, which is slower and by construction exact, yielding in every
case the same correct results. Finally, the approach is extended to an
algorithm that calculates the innermost Tukey region and its barycenter, the

transition, the superfluid density $\rho_s$ and superfluid velocity $v_s$
increase as power laws of temperature described by a universal critical
exponent constrained to be equal by scale invariance. As the dimensionality is
reduced towards one dimension (1D), it is expected that enhanced thermal and
quantum fluctuations preclude long-range order, thereby inhibiting
superfluidity. We have measured the flow rate of liquid helium and deduced its
superfluid velocity in a capillary flow experiment occurring in single $30~$nm
long nanopores with radii ranging down from 20~nm to 3~nm. As the pore size is
reduced towards the 1D limit, we observe: {\it i)} a suppression of the
pressure dependence of the superfluid velocity; {\it ii)} a temperature
dependence of $v_{s}$ that surprisingly can be well-fitted by a powerlaw with a
single exponent over a broad range of temperatures; and {\it iii)} decreasing
critical velocities as a function of radius for channel sizes below $R \simeq
20$~nm, in stark contrast with what is observed in micron sized channels. We
interpret these deviations from bulk behaviour as signaling the crossover to a
quasi-1D state whereby the size of a critical topological defect is cut off by
the channel radius.

mainly designed for text and line extraction in screen content. The proposed
method makes use of the fact that the background in each block is usually
smoothly varying and can be modeled well by a linear combination of a few
smoothly varying basis functions, while the foreground text and graphics create
sharp discontinuity. The algorithm separates the background and foreground
pixels by trying to fit pixel values in the block into a smooth function using
a robust regression method. The inlier pixels that can fit well will be
considered as background, while remaining outlier pixels will be considered
foreground. This algorithm has been extensively tested on several images from
HEVC standard test sequences for screen content coding, and is shown to have
superior performance over other methods, such as the k-means clustering based
segmentation algorithm in DjVu. This background/foreground segmentation can be
used in different applications such as: text extraction, separate coding of
background and foreground for compression of screen content and mixed content
documents, principle line extraction from palmprint and crease detection in
fingerprint images.

the mean velocity and Reynolds shear stress profiles. Using the criteria as a
guide, Castillo, George, and coworkers examined an extensive set of
experimental datasets and claim that most of these turbulent velocity boundary
layers appear to be similar boundary layers when scaled with the Zagarola and
Smits (Zagarola, M. and Smits, A., J. Fluid Mech. 373, 33(1998)) velocity
parameter. In the work herein it is shown that their success at showing scaled

problem that occurs when one combines the defect profile and the Zagarola and
Smits type of velocity scaling parameter. The same problem has been identified
in other papers in the literature and may in fact be widespread. We conclude
that similarity of the turbulent velocity profile is not as prevalent as was
claimed by Castillo, George, and coworkers. The result has implications as to
the accepted paradigm of the scaling of the turbulent boundary layer.

related to its stochastic derivation and interpretation, advocating the use of
the RSEAC to properly describe the relativistic diffusion phenomena. Taking
into account that the Lorentz symmetry is broken in UV regime at Lifshitz
point, we show that there exists a degeneracy in very high energies, meaning
that both the RSEAC and the TE correctly describe the diffusion processes at
these energy scales, at least under the spectral dimension criterion. In fact,
both the equations yield the same result, namely, $d_s = 2$, a dimensional
reduction that is compatible with several theories of quantum gravity. This
result is reached even when one takes into account a cosmological model - the
De Sitter one - for a flat Universe. On the other hand, in the IR regimen, such
degeneracy is lifted in favor of the approach via TE, due to the fact that only
this equation provides the correct value for $d_s$, which is equal to the
actual number of spacetime dimensions, i. e., $d_s = 4$, while RSEAC furnishes
$d_s=3$, so that a diffusing particle described by this latter experiences a

Electron-hole pairing significantly changes the response to the scalar
potential, as well. It results in a complete (at zero temperature) or partial
(at finite temperature) suppression of screening of the electric field of a
test charge situated at some distance to the double layer system. A strong
increase of the electric field induced by the test charge under decrease in

to model heating by the shock generated during entry and the subsequent thermal
diffusion inside the body of a meteorite. Experimental data was used for the
thermal parameters of several types of meteorites, including iron-nickel and
several classes of chondrites. A Sutton-Graves model of stagnation-point

pyrolytic temperature penetration to a depth of ca. 0.5 to 1 cm.
Non-dissociative warming of meteorite interiors penetrates further to ca. 4 cm.

squared four-momenta of the exchanged virtual photon, $Q^2$, and at different
four-momentum transfer, t, can be used to probe QCD's transition from
meson-nucleon degrees of freedom at long distances to quark-gluon degrees of
freedom at short scales. Ratios of separated response functions in $\pi^-$ and
$\pi^+$ electroproduction are particularly informative. The ratio for
transverse photons may allow this transition to be more easily observed, while
the ratio for longitudinal photons provides a crucial verification of the
assumed pole dominance, needed for reliable extraction of the pion form factor
from electroproduction data. Method: Data were acquired with 2.6-5.2 GeV
electron beams and the HMS+SOS spectrometers in Jefferson Lab Hall C, at
central $Q^2$ values of 0.6, 1.0, 1.6 GeV$^2$ at W=1.95 GeV, and $Q^2$=2.45
GeV$^2$ at W=2.22 GeV. There was significant coverage in $\phi$ and $\epsilon$,
which allowed separation of $\sigma_{L,T,LT,TT}$. Results: $\sigma_L$ shows a
clear signature of the pion pole, with a sharp rise at small -t. In contrast,
$\sigma_T$ is much flatter versus t. The longitudinal/transverse ratios evolve
with $Q^2$ and t, and at the highest $Q^2$=2.45 GeV$^2$ show a slight
enhancement for $\pi^-$ production compared to $\pi^+$. The $\pi^-/\pi^+$ ratio
for transverse photons exhibits only a small $Q^2$-dependence, following a
nearly universal curve with t, with a steep transition to a value of about
0.25, consistent with s-channel quark knockout. The $\sigma_{TT}/\sigma_T$
ratio also drops rapidly with $Q^2$, qualitatively consistent with s-channel
helicity conservation. The $\pi^-/\pi^+$ ratio for longitudinal photons
indicates a small isoscalar contamination at W=1.95 GeV, consistent with what
was observed in our earlier determination of the pion form factor at these
kinematics.

determine $k_\mathrm{ia}$, we measured the trap loading and loss from both a

irregular waves are generated unidirectionally. The role of the basin boundary
conditions (absorbing or reflecting) and of the forcing properties are
investigated. To that purpose, an absorbing sloping beach opposite to the
wavemaker can be replaced by a reflecting vertical wall. We observe that the
wave field properties depend strongly on these boundary conditions. Quasi-one
dimensional field of nonlinear waves propagate before to be damped by the beach
whereas a more multidirectional wave field is observed with the wall. In both
cases, the wave spectrum scales as a frequency-power law with an exponent that
increases continuously with the forcing amplitude up to a value close to -4,
which is the value predicted by the weak turbulence theory. The physical
mechanisms involved are probably different according to the boundary condition
used, but cannot be easily discriminated with only temporal measurements. We
have also studied freely decaying gravity wave turbulence in the closed basin.
No self-similar decay of the spectrum is observed, whereas its Fourier modes
decay first as a time power law due to nonlinear mechanisms, and then
exponentially due to linear viscous damping. We estimate the linear, nonlinear
and dissipative time scales to test the time scale separation that highlights
the important role of a large scale Fourier mode. By estimation of the mean
energy flux from the initial decay of wave energy, the Kolmogorov-Zakharov
constant is evaluated and found to be compatible with a recent theoretical
value.

eclipsing radio millisecond pulsar and a low-mass X-ray binary. We present a
multi-wavelength observational campaign of PSR J1023+0038 in its most recent
low-mass X-ray binary state. Two long XMM-Newton observations reveal that the
system spends ~70% of the time in a $\approx$$3\times10^{33}$ erg/s X-ray
luminosity mode, which, as shown in Archibald et al. (2014), exhibits coherent
X-ray pulsations. This emission is interspersed with frequent lower flux mode
intervals with $\approx$$5\times 10^{32}$ erg/s and sporadic flares reaching up
to $\approx$$10^{34}$ erg/s, with neither mode showing significant X-ray
pulsations. The switches between the three flux modes occur on timescales of
order 10 s. In the UV and optical, we observe occasional intense flares
coincident with those observed in X-rays. Our radio timing observations reveal
no pulsations at the pulsar period during any of the three X-ray modes,
presumably due to complete quenching of the radio emission mechanism by the
accretion flow. Radio imaging detects highly variable, flat-spectrum continuum
emission from PSR J1023+0038, consistent with an origin in a weak jet-like
outflow. Our concurrent X-ray and radio continuum data sets do not exhibit any
correlated behavior. The observational evidence we present bears qualitative
resemblance to the behavior predicted by some existing propeller and trapped
disk accretion models although none can fully account for all aspects of the
rich phenomenology of this system.

are only equality constraints) or more generally Bregman-Dykstra iterations
(when inequality constraints are in-volved). We illustrate the usefulness of
this approach to several variational problems related to optimal transport:

of just 1.37 kpc, PSR J1023+0038 offers an unsurpassed ability to study
low-level accretion onto a highly-magnetized compact object. We have monitored
PSR J1023+0038 intensively using radio imaging with the Karl G. Jansky Very
Large Array, the European VLBI Network and LOFAR, seeing rapidly variable, flat
spectrum emission that persists over a period of 6 months. The flat spectrum
and variability are indicative of synchrotron emission originating in an
outflow from the system, most likely in the form of a compact, partially
self-absorbed jet, as is seen in LMXBs at higher accretion rates. The radio
brightness, however, greatly exceeds extrapolations made from observations of
more vigorously accreting neutron star LMXB systems. We postulate that PSR
J1023+0038 is undergoing radiatively inefficient 'propeller-mode' accretion,
with the jet carrying away a dominant fraction of the liberated accretion
luminosity. We confirm that the enhanced gamma-ray emission seen in PSR
J1023+0038 since it re-entered an accreting state has been maintained; the
increased gamma-ray emission in this state can also potentially be associated
with propeller-mode accretion. Similar accretion modes can be invoked to
explain the radio and X-ray properties of the other two known transitional
millisecond pulsar systems XSS J12270-4859 and PSR J1824-2452I (M28I),
suggesting that radiatively inefficient accretion may be an ubiquitous
phenomenon amongst (at least one class of) neutron star binaries at low
accretion rates.

investigating the structure of semigroups of the form
$\mathsf{IG}(\mathcal{E})$, especially regarding their maximal subgroups. In
this paper we take these investigations in a new direction by considering the
word problem for $\mathsf{IG}(\mathcal{E})$. We prove two principal results,
one positive and one negative. We show that, for a finite biordered set
$\mathcal{E}$, it is decidable whether a given word $w \in E^*$ represents a
regular element; if in addition one assumes that all maximal subgroups of
$\mathsf{IG}(\mathcal{E})$ have decidable word problems, then the word problem
in $\mathsf{IG}(\mathcal{E})$ restricted to regular words is decidable. On the
other hand, we exhibit a biorder $\mathcal{E}$ arising from a finite idempotent
semigroup $S$, such that the word problem for $\mathsf{IG}(\mathcal{E})$ is
undecidable, even though all the maximal subgroups have decidable word
problems. This is achieved by relating the word problem of
$\mathsf{IG}(\mathcal{E})$ to the subgroup membership problem in finitely
presented groups.

longitudinal magnetoresistance that is capable of overcoming their very
pronounced orbital one. This effect is correlated with the inter-layer coupling
disappearing for fields applied along the so-called Yamaji angles where the
inter-layer coupling vanishes. Therefore, it is intrinsically associated with
the Fermi points in the field-induced quasi-one-dimensional electronic
dispersion, implying that it results from the axial anomaly among these Fermi
points. In its original formulation, the anomaly is predicted to violate
separate number conservation laws for left- and right-handed chiral- (e.g.
Weyl) fermions. Its observation in PdCoO$_2$, PtCoO$_2$ and Sr$_2$RuO$_4$
suggests that the anomaly affects the transport of clean conductors,
particularly near the quantum limit.

the semileptonic kaon decay $K_{\ell4}$ and hadronic light-by-light scattering.
  The $K_{\ell4}$ decay is one of the best sources of information on some of
the parameters of chiral perturbation theory. The dispersion relation for
$K_{\ell4}$ provides a resummation of $\pi\pi$- and $K\pi$-rescattering
effects. In contrast to a pure chiral treatment, it reproduces the observed
curvature of one of the form factors. The matching of the dispersion relation
to the chiral representation of the form factors allows the extraction of the
values of three low-energy constants.
  Hadronic light-by-light scattering appears as a virtual process in the
calculation of the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon $(g-2)_\mu$. For more
than a decade, a discrepancy of about $3\sigma$ has persisted between the
experimental determination and the standard-model prediction of the
$(g-2)_\mu$. It is expected that within a few years hadronic light-by-light
scattering will dominate the uncertainty of the theory prediction of the
$(g-2)_\mu$. So far, only model calculations of the hadronic light-by-light
contribution are available. However, in view of forthcoming $(g-2)_\mu$
experiments at Fermilab and J-PARC it is crucial that the hadronic
light-by-light calculation can be improved systematically. The dispersive
description presented here provides a formalism for a data-driven determination
of hadronic light-by-light scattering and hence opens up an avenue towards a
model-independent evaluation of the $(g-2)_\mu$.

stellar astrophysics, that covariant structure can lead to dramatically
underestimated parameter uncertainties (and, in some cases, biases). We
construct a likelihood function that accounts for the structure of the
covariance matrix, utilizing the machinery of Gaussian process kernels. This
framework specifically address the common problem of mismatches in model
spectral line strengths (with respect to data) due to intrinsic model
imperfections (e.g., in the atomic/molecular databases or opacity
prescriptions) by developing a novel local covariance kernel formalism that
identifies and self-consistently downweights pathological spectral line

kernels provide a mechanism to learn about and build data-driven corrections to
synthetic spectral libraries. An open-source software implementation of this
approach is available at http://iancze.github.io/Starfish, including a
sophisticated probabilistic scheme for spectral interpolation when using model
libraries that are sparsely sampled in the stellar parameters. We demonstrate

Each team adopted their preferred fitting code, assumptions, priors, and
parameter grid. The combination of results using the same underlying stellar
isochrones reduces the systematics associated with the fitting code and other
choices. Thanks to the availability of different estimates, we can test the
effect of some specific parameters and assumptions on the stellar mass
estimate. The choice of the stellar isochrone library turns out to have the
largest effect on the galaxy stellar mass estimates, resulting in the largest
distributions around the median value (with a semi interquartile range larger
than 0.1 dex). On the other hand, for most galaxies, the stellar mass estimates
are relatively insensitive to the different parameterizations of the star
formation history. The inclusion of nebular emission in the model spectra does
not have a significant impact for the majority of galaxies (less than a factor
of 2 for ~80% of the sample). Nevertheless, the stellar mass for the subsample
of young galaxies (age < 100 Myr), especially in particular redshift ranges

atoms, molecules and dust grains, called the interstellar medium (ISM).
Understanding its physical properties and dynamical behavior is of pivotal
importance to many areas of astronomy and astrophysics. Galaxy formation and
evolution, the formation of stars, cosmic nucleosynthesis, the origin of large
complex, prebiotic molecules and the abundance, structure and growth of dust
grains which constitute the fundamental building blocks of planets, all these
processes are intimately coupled to the physics of the interstellar medium.
However, despite its importance, its structure and evolution is still not fully
understood. Observations reveal that the interstellar medium is highly
turbulent, consists of different chemical phases, and is characterized by
complex structure on all resolvable spatial and temporal scales. Our current
numerical and theoretical models describe it as a strongly coupled system that
is far from equilibrium and where the different components are intricately
linked together by complex feedback loops. Describing the interstellar medium
is truly a multi-scale and multi-physics problem. In these lecture notes we
introduce the microphysics necessary to better understand the interstellar
medium. We review the relations between large-scale and small-scale dynamics,
we consider turbulence as one of the key drivers of galactic evolution, and we

several options. One would be to focus on a narrow subset of topics and to
cover them in great detail. Such a subset necessarily would be highly personal
and useful to a few read- ers at best. Another option would be to give a very
shallow overview of the whole field, but then it won't be very much different
from a highly compressed version of a university course (which anyone can take
if they wish so). So, I decided to be selfish and to prepare these lectures as
if I was teaching my own graduate student. Given my research interests, I
selected what the student would need to know to be able to discuss science with
me and to work on joint research projects. So, the story presented below is
both personal and incomplete, but it does cover several subjects that are
poorly represented in the existing textbooks (if at all). Some of topics I
focus on below are closely connected, others are disjoint, some are just side
detours on specific technical questions. There is an overlapping theme,
however. Our goal is to follow the cosmic gas from large scales, low densities,
(rel- atively) simple physics to progressively smaller scales, higher
densities, closer rela- tion to galaxies, and more complex and uncertain
physics. So, we (you - the reader, and me - the author) are going to follow a
""yellow brick road"" from the gas well be- yond any galaxy confines to the
actual sites of star formation and stellar feedback. On the way we will stop at
some places for a tour and run without looking back through some others. So,
the road will be uneven, but I hope that some readers find it useful.

massive to trigger runaway gas accretion in less that the typical lifetime of
protoplanetary disks. We explore how the minimum required core mass, M_crit,
depends on a non-ideal equation of state and on opacity changes due to grain
growth, across a range of stellocentric distances from 5-100 AU. This minimum
M_crit applies when planetesimal accretion does not substantially heat the
atmosphere. Compared to an ideal gas polytrope, the inclusion of molecular
hydrogen (H_2) dissociation and variable occupation of H_2 rotational states
increases M_crit. Specifically, M_crit increases by a factor of ~2 if the H_2
spin isomers, ortho- and parahydrogen, are in thermal equilibrium, and by a
factor of ~2-4 if the ortho-to-para ratio is fixed at 3:1. Lower opacities due
to grain growth reduce M_crit. For a standard disk model around a Solar mass
star, we calculate M_crit ~ 8 M_Earth at 5 AU, decreasing to ~5 M_Earth at 100
AU, for a realistic EOS with an equilibrium ortho-to-para ratio and for grain
growth to cm-sizes. If grain coagulation is taken into account, M_crit may
further reduce by up to one order of magnitude. These results for the minimum
critical core mass are useful for the interpretation of surveys that find
exoplanets at a range of orbital distances.

use of meshes with a finite number of nodes to analyze and manipulate data.
Specific examples in lensing are astronomical CCD images in general, the
reconstruction of density distributions from lensing data, lens-source plane
mapping or the characterization and interpolation of a point-spread-function.
We present a numerical framework to interpolate and differentiate in the
mesh-free domain, defined by nodes with coordinates that follow no regular
pattern. The framework is based on radial basis functions (RBFs) to smoothly
represent data around the nodes. We demonstrate the performance of Gaussian
RBF-based, mesh-free interpolation and differentiation, which reaches the
sub-percent level in both cases. We use our newly developed framework to
translate ideas of free-form mass reconstruction from lensing onto the
mesh-free domain. By reconstructing a simulated mock lens we find that strong
lensing only reconstructions achieve < 10% accuracy in the areas where these
constraints are available but provide poorer results when departing from these
regions. Weak-lensing only reconstructions give < 10% percent accuracy outside
the strong lensing regime, but cannot resolve the inner core structure of the
lens. Once both regimes are combined, accurate reconstructions can be achieved
over the full field of view. The reconstruction of a simulated lens, using
constraints that mimics real observations, yields accurate results in terms of
surface-mass density, NFW parameter, Einstein radius and magnification map
recovery, encouraging the application of this method to real data.

Liouville action, one-loop diagrams resulting from the non-trivial measure on
the space of metrics, as well as one-loop diagrams involving various
counterterm vertices. Contrary to what is often believed, several such
counterterms, in addition to the usual cosmological constant, do and must
occur. We consistently determine the relevant counterterms from a one-loop
computation of the full two-point Green's function of the Kaehler field.
Throughout this paper we use the general spectral cutoff regularization
developed recently and which is well-suited for multi-loop computations on
curved manifolds. At two loops, while all ""unwanted"" contributions to $\ln
(Z[A]/Z[A_0])$ correctly cancel, it appears that the finite coefficient of $\ln
(A/A_0)$ does depend on the finite parts of certain counterterm coefficients,
i.e. on the finite renormalization conditions one has to impose. There exists a
choice that reproduces the famous KPZ-scaling, but it seems to be only one
consistent choice among others. Maybe, this hints at the possibility that other
renormalization conditions could eventually provide a way to circumvent the

massive, distant (z=1.579) galaxy cluster discovered in the XDCP survey. The
total exposure time of 380 ks with Chandra ACIS-S provides the deepest X-ray
observation currently achieved on a massive, high redshift cluster. Extended
emission from the Intra Cluster Medium (ICM) is detected at a very high
significance level (S/N~20) on a circular region with a 44"" radius,
corresponding to $R_{ext}=375$ kpc at the cluster redshift. We perform an X-ray
spectral fit of the ICM emission modeling the spectrum with a
single-temperature thermal mekal model. Our analysis provides a global
temperature $kT=6.7^{+1.3}_{-0.9}$ keV, and a iron abundance $Z_{Fe} =
0.41_{-0.26}^{+0.29}Z_{Fe_\odot}$ (error bars correspond to 1 $\sigma$). We fit
the background-subtracted surface brightness profile with a single
$\beta$-model out to 44"", finding a rather flat profile with no hints of a cool
core. We derive the deprojected electron density profile and compute the ICM
mass within the extraction radius $R_{ext}=375$ kpc to be $M_{ICM}(r<R_{ext}) =
(1.48 \pm 0.20) \times 10^{13} M_\odot$. Under the assumption of hydrostatic
equilibrium and assuming isothermality within $R_{ext}$, the total mass is
$M_{2500}= 1.23_{-0.27}^{+0.46} \times 10 ^{14} M_\odot$ for $R_{2500} =
240_{-20}^{+30}$ kpc. Extrapolating the profile at radii larger than the
extraction radius $R_{ext}$ we find $M_{500} = 3.2_{-0.6}^{+0.9} \times 10
^{14}M_\odot$ for $R_{500} = 562_{-37}^{+50}$ kpc. This analysis establishes
the existence of virialized, massive galaxy clusters at redshift $z\sim 1.6$,
paving the way to the investigation of the progenitors of the most massive
clusters today. Given its mass and the XDCP survey volume, XDCP J0044.0-2033
does not create significant tension with the WMAP-7 $\Lambda$CDM cosmology.

uncertainty, imprecise, incomplete and inconsistent. In this paper a score
function and an accuracy function for single valued neutrosophic sets is
firstly proposed to make the distinction between them. Then the idea is
extended to interval neutrosophic sets. A multi-criteria decision making method
based on the developed score-accuracy functions is established in which
criterion values for alternatives are single valued neutrosophic sets and
interval neutrosophic sets. In decision making process, the neutrosophic
weighted aggregation operators (arithmetic and geometric average operators) are
adopted to aggregate the neutrosophic information related to each alternative.
Thus, we can rank all alternatives and make the selection of the best of one(s)
according to the score-accuracy functions. Finally, some illustrative examples
are presented to verify the developed approach and to demonstrate its
practicality and effectiveness.

which is either a randomly chosen permutation or a randomly chosen function.
When queried by an $n$-bit string $w$, the oracle computes $f(w)$, truncates
the $m$ last bits, and returns only the first $n-m$ bits of $f(w)$. How many
queries does a querying adversary need to submit in order to distinguish the
truncated permutation from the (truncated) function?
  In 1998, Hall et al. showed an algorithm for determining (with high
probability) whether or not $f$ is a permutation, using $O(2^{\frac{m+n}{2}})$
queries. They also showed that if $m < n/7$, a smaller number of queries will
not suffice. For $m > n/7$, their method gives a weaker bound. In this note, we
first show how a modification of the approximation method used by Hall et al.
can solve the problem completely. It extends the result to practically any $m$,
showing that $\Omega(2^{\frac{m+n}{2}})$ queries are needed to get a
non-negligible distinguishing advantage. However, more surprisingly, a better
bound for the distinguishing advantage can be obtained from a result of Stam
published, in a different context, already in 1978. We also show that, at least
in some cases, Stam's bound is tight.

shallow geometric set systems. Specifically, let $\V$ be a finite set system
defined over an $n$-point set $X$; we view $\V$ as a set of indicator vectors
over the $n$-dimensional unit cube. A $\delta$-separated set of $\V$ is a
subcollection $\W$, s.t. the Hamming distance between each pair $\uu, \vv \in
\W$ is greater than $\delta$, where $\delta > 0$ is an integer parameter. The
$\delta$-packing number is then defined as the cardinality of the largest
$\delta$-separated subcollection of $\V$. Haussler showed an asymptotically
tight bound of $\Theta((n/\delta)^d)$ on the $\delta$-packing number if $\V$
has VC-dimension (or \emph{primal shatter dimension}) $d$. We refine this bound
for the scenario where, for any subset, $X' \subseteq X$ of size $m \le n$ and
for any parameter $1 \le k \le m$, the number of vectors of length at most $k$
in the restriction of $\V$ to $X'$ is only $O(m^{d_1} k^{d-d_1})$, for a fixed
integer $d > 0$ and a real parameter $1 \le d_1 \le d$ (this generalizes the
standard notion of \emph{bounded primal shatter dimension} when $d_1 = d$). In
this case when $\V$ is ""$k$-shallow"" (all vector lengths are at most $k$), we
show that its $\delta$-packing number is $O(n^{d_1} k^{d-d_1}/\delta^d)$,
matching Haussler's bound for the special cases where $d_1=d$ or $k=n$. As an
immediate consequence we conclude that set systems of halfspaces, balls, and
parallel slabs defined over $n$ points in $d$-space admit better packing
numbers when $k$ is smaller than $n$. Last but not least, we describe
applications to (i) spanning trees of low total crossing number, and (ii)

Powered by
the magnetic energy, and not by the rotational energy as in the case of radio
pulsars, they have long been regarded as a completely different class of
neutron stars. The discovery of pulsed radio emission from a few magnetars
weakened the idea of a clean separation between magnetars and normal pulsars.
We use the partially screened gap (PSG) model to explain radio emission of
magnetars. The PSG model requires that the temperature of the polar cap is
equal to the so-called critical value, i.e., the temperature at which the
thermal ions outflowing from the stellar surface screen the acceleration gap.
We show that a magnetar has to fulfill the temperature, power, and visibility
conditions in order to emit radio waves. First, in order to form PSG, the
residual temperature of the surface has to be lower than the critical value.
Second, since the radio emission is powered by the rotational energy, it has to
be high enough to enable heating of the polar cap by backstreaming particles to
the critical temperature. Finally, the structure of the magnetic field has to
be altered by magnetospheric currents in order to widen a radio beam and
increase the probability of detection. Our approach allows us to predict
whether a magnetar can emit radio waves using only its rotational period,

satisfying the 2nd law of thermodynamics in the form of Calusius-Duhem

energy dissipation. As compared to Prony series, the most general model being
used often with a large number of model parameters, the proposed model has
improved accuracy in fitting experimental data and predicting modulus outside

design. The new model also has higher numerical accuracy while competitive

single-parameter stochastic model for halo bias to position haloes. HALOGEN
represents a simplification of similar recently published methods.
  Our method is constrained to recover the 2-point function at intermediate

Larger scales ($\sim100Mpc/h$) are reproduced to within 15 per cent. We compare
several other statistics (e.g. power spectrum, point distribution function,
redshift space distortions) with results from N-Body simulations to determine
the validity of our method for different purposes. One of the benefits of
HALOGEN is its flexibility, and we demonstrate this by showing how it can be
adapted to varying cosmologies and simulation specifications.
  A driving motivation for the development of such approximate schemes is the
need to compute covariance matrices and study the systematic errors for large
galaxy surveys, which requires thousands of simulated realisations. We discuss
the applicability of our method in this context, and conclude that it is well
suited to mass production of appropriate halo catalogues.

multiple-output (MIMO) relay systems in the presence of imperfect channel state
information (CSI). The base station (BS) and the MIMO relay station (RS) are
both equipped with the same codebook of unitary matrices. According to each
element of the codebook, we create a latent precoding matrix pair, namely a BS
precoding matrix and an RS precoding matrix. The RS precoding matrix is formed
by multiplying the appropriate unitary matrix from the codebook by a power
scaling factor. Based on the given CSI and a block of transmit symbols, the
optimum precoding matrix pair, within the class of all possible latent
precoding matrix pairs derived from the various unitary matrices, is selected
by a suitable selection mechanism for transmission, which is designed to
minimize the squared Euclidean distance between the pre-estimated received
vector and the true transmit symbol vector. We develop a minimum mean square
error (MMSE) design algorithm for the construction of the latent precoding
matrix pairs. In the proposed scheme, rather than sending the complete
processing matrix, only the index of the unitary matrix and its power scaling
factor are sent by the BS to the RS. This significantly reduces the overhead.
Simulation results show that compared to other recently reported precoding
algorithms the proposed precoding scheme is capable of providing improved
robustness against the effects of CSI estimation errors and multiuser
interference.

$p,q\ge 2$; $t_1,t_2\ge 0,$ and are both homogeneous polynomials of $t_1$ and
$t_2$ for fixed $p,q$. In particular, $Z_2(t)$ is the Brownian motion and
$Z_3(t)$ is the same as $W_2(t)$ up to a constant.

with predictions of the FLRW cosmological model based on a variant of $f(R)$
modified gravity proposed by one of the authors previously. This viable
cosmological model which deviation from general relativity with a cosmological
constant $\Lambda$ decreases as $R^{-2n}$ for large, but not too large values
of the Ricci scalar $R$ provides an alternative explanation of present dark
energy and the accelerated expansion of the Universe. Various up-to-date
cosmological data sets exploited include Planck CMB anisotropy, CMB lensing
potential, BAO, cluster mass function and Hubble constant measurements. We find
that the CMB+BAO constraints strongly the sum of neutrino masses from above.
This excludes values $\lambda\sim 1$ for which distinctive cosmological
features of the model are mostly pronounced as compared to the $\Lambda$CDM
model, since then free streaming damping of perturbations due to neutrino rest
masses is not sufficient to compensate their extra growth occurring in $f(R)$
gravity. Thus, we obtain $\lambda>8.2$ ($2\sigma$) with cluster systematics and
$\lambda>9.4$ ($2\sigma$) without that. In the latter case we find for the
sterile neutrino mass
$0.47\,\,\rm{eV}$$\,<\,$$m_{\nu,\,\rm{sterile}}$$\,<\,$$1\,\,\rm{eV}$

larger than in the standard $\Lambda$CDM with the same data set:

fixed point representation for the TL1 regularized minimization problem. The
TL1 thresholding functions are in closed form for all parameter values. In
contrast, the $l_p$ thresholding functions ($p \in [0,1]$) are in closed form
only for $p=0,1,1/2,2/3$, known as hard, soft, half, and 2/3 thresholding
respectively. The TL1 threshold values differ in subcritical (supercritical)
parameter regime where the TL1 threshold functions are continuous
(discontinuous) similar to soft-thresholding (half-thresholding) functions. We
propose TL1 iterative thresholding algorithms and compare them with hard and
half thresholding algorithms in CS test problems. For both incoherent and
coherent sensing matrices, a proposed TL1 iterative thresholding algorithm with
adaptive subcritical and supercritical thresholds consistently performs the
best in sparse signal recovery with and without measurement noise.

maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) [5], a measure of distance between probability

in their ability to enhance their power infrastructure to support increased

is projected that future-generation supercomputers will be power-limited rather

the available level. In this paper, we present a statistically grounded

will need and use these predictions to provide an optimal node-level power
capping strategy. We model the power drawn by a given job (and subsequently by

time series. However, as the number of component series is increased, the VAR
model becomes overparameterized. Several authors have addressed this issue by
incorporating regularized approaches, such as the lasso in VAR estimation.
Traditional approaches address overparameterization by selecting a low lag
order, based on the assumption of short range dependence, assuming that a
universal lag order applies to all components. Such an approach constrains the
relationship between the components and impedes forecast performance. The
lasso-based approaches work much better in high-dimensional situations but do
not incorporate the notion of lag order selection.
  We propose a new class of hierarchical lag structures (HLag) that embed the
notion of lag selection into a convex regularizer. The key modeling tool is a
group lasso with nested groups which guarantees that the sparsity pattern of
lag coefficients honors the VAR's ordered structure. The HLag framework offers
three structures, which allow for varying levels of flexibility. A simulation
study demonstrates improved performance in forecasting and lag order selection
over previous approaches, and a macroeconomic application further highlights
forecasting improvements as well as HLag's convenient, interpretable output.

the case studied here, topological order is reflected in the presence of two
(nearly) isolated Majorana fermionic end bound modes together forming an
electronic state that can be occupied or not, leading to two (nearly)
degenerate ground states characterized by fermion parity. Our study begins with
a characterization of the static properties of the finite-sized wire, including
the behavior of the Majorana end modes and the form of the tunnel coupling
between them; a transfer matrix approach to analytically determine the
locations of the zero energy contours where this coupling vanishes; and a
Pfaffian approach to map the ground state parity in the associated phase
diagram. We next study the quench dynamics resulting from initializing the
system in a topological ground state and then dynamically tuning one of the
parameters of the Hamiltonian. For this, we develop a dynamic quantum many-body
technique that invokes a Wick's theorem for Majorana fermions, vastly reducing
the numerical effort given the exponentially large Hilbert space. We
investigate the salient and detailed features of two dynamic quantities - the
overlap between the time-evolved state and the instantaneous ground state
(adiabatic fidelity) and the residual energy. When the parity of the
instantaneous ground state flips successively with time, we find that the
time-evolved state can dramatically switch back and forth between this state
and an excited state even when the quenching is very slow, a phenomenon that we
term ""parity blocking"". This parity blocking becomes prominently manifest as
non-analytic jumps as a function of time in both dynamic quantities.

capacity for multiple steady states? There is no complete answer to this
question, but over the last 40 years various criteria have been developed that
can answer this question in certain cases. This work surveys these
developments, with an emphasis on recent results that connect the capacity for
multistationarity of one network to that of another. In this latter setting, we
consider a network $N$ that is embedded in a larger network $G$, which means
that $N$ is obtained from $G$ by removing some subsets of chemical species and
reactions. This embedding relation is a significant generalization of the
subnetwork relation. For arbitrary networks, it is not true that if $N$ is
embedded in $G$, then the steady states of $N$ lift to $G$. Nonetheless, this
does hold for certain classes of networks; one such class is that of fully open
networks. This motivates the search for embedding-minimal multistationary
networks: those networks which admit multiple steady states but no proper,
embedded networks admit multiple steady states. We present results about such
minimal networks, including several new constructions of infinite families of
these networks.

Inspired by the directional tensor product complex tight framelets ${TP-CTF}_m$
with $m\ge 3$ in [14,18] and their impressive performance for image processing
in [18,30] in this paper we introduce a directional tensor product complex
tight framelet ${TP-CTF}^!_6$ (called reduced ${TP-CTF}_6$) with low

filter banks with mixed sampling factors. The ${TP-CTF}^!_6$ in $d$ dimensions
not only offers good directionality but also has the low redundancy rate
$\frac{3^d-1}{2^d-1}$ (e.g., the redundancy rates are $2,
2\mathord{\frac{2}{3}}, 3\mathord{\frac{5}{7}}, 5\mathord{\frac{1}{3}}$ and
$7\mathord{\frac{25}{31}}$ for dimension $d=1,..., 5$, respectively). Moreover,
our numerical experiments on image/video denoising and inpainting show that the

better than several state-of-the-art frame-based methods which have much higher

topic.While many investigations are limited to applications with high impact
velocities (for raindrops of the order of a few m/s), the essence of robustness
is yet to be analyzed for applications involving quasi-static liquid
transfer.To achieve robustness with high impact velocities, the surface
parameters (geometrical details, chemistry) have to be selected from a narrow
range of permissible values, which often entail additional manufacturing
costs.From the dual perspectives of thermodynamics and mechanics, we analyze
the significance of robustness for quasi-static drop impact, and present the
range of permissible surface characteristics.For surfaces with a Youngs contact
angle greater than 90{\deg} and square micropillar geometry, we show that
robustness can be enforced when an intermediate wetting state (sagged state)
impedes transition to a wetted state (Wenzel state).From the standpoint of
mechanics, we use available scientific data to prove that a surface with any
topology must withstand a pressure of 117 Pa to be robust.Finally, permissible
values of surface characteristics are determined, which ensure robustness with
thermodynamics (formation of sagged state) and mechanics (withstanding 117 Pa).

(MEE) algorithm in a regression setting. We introduce two types of consistency.
The error entropy consistency, which requires the error entropy of the learned
function to approximate the minimum error entropy, is shown to be always true
if the bandwidth parameter tends to 0 at an appropriate rate. The regression
consistency, which requires the learned function to approximate the regression
function, however, is a complicated issue. We prove that the error entropy
consistency implies the regression consistency for homoskedastic models where
the noise is independent of the input variable. But for heteroskedastic models,
a counterexample is used to show that the two types of consistency do not
coincide. A surprising result is that the regression consistency is always
true, provided that the bandwidth parameter tends to infinity at an appropriate
rate. Regression consistency of two classes of special models is shown to hold
with fixed bandwidth parameter, which further illustrates the complexity of
regression consistency of MEE. Fourier transform plays crucial roles in our
analysis.

for different superconducting phenomena. We study the macroscopic quantum
tunneling (MQT) in a Josephson junction, composed of a single-gap
superconductor and a two-gap superconductor. Since this junction has two kinds
to the superconducting phase differences, calculating the MQT escape rate
requires the analysis of quantum tunneling in a multi-dimensional configuration
space. Our approach is the semi-classical approximation along a 1D curve in a
2D potential- energy landscape, connecting two adjacent potential (local)
minimums through a saddle point. We find that this system has two plausible
tunneling paths; an in-phase path and an out-of-phase path. The former is
characterized by the Josephson-plasma frequency, whereas the latter is by the
frequency of the characteristic collective mode in a two-band superconductor,
Josephson- Leggett mode. Depending on external bias current and inter-band
Josephson-coupling energy, one of them mainly contributes to the MQT. Our
numerical calculations show that the difference between the in-phase path and
the out-of-phase path is manifest, with respect to the bias- current-dependence
of the MQT escape rate. This result suggests that our MQT setting be an
indicator of the Josephson-Leggett mode.

extensive experimental evaluation that compares the performance of the

single impurity atom of one component interacts with condensed pairs of the

approach in the vicinity of a narrow Feshbach resonance, we show that the
impurity atom smoothly changes its character from atom to trimer with
increasing the attraction and eventually there is a sharp transition to dimer.
The emergent polaronic atom-trimer continuity can be probed in ultracold atoms

hierarchy of multipartite nonlocality can be observed in the gapless phase of
the model, meanwhile only the lowest hierarchy of multipartite nonlocality is
observed in most regions of the gapped anti-ferromagnetic phase. Thereby,
Bell-type inequalities disclose different correlation structures in the two
phases of the system. Furthermore, at the infinite-order QPT (or
Kosterlitz-Thouless QPT) point of the model, the correlation measures always
show a local minimum value, regardless of the length of the subchains. It
indicates that relatively low hierarchy of multi-partite nonlocality would be
observed at the infinite-order QPT point in a Bell-type experiment. The result
is in contrast to the existing results of the second-order QPT in the
one-dimensional XY model, where multi-partite nonlocality with the hierarchy
has been observed. Thus, multi-partite nonlocality provides us an alternative
perspective to distinguish between these two kinds of QPTs. Reliable clues for
the existence of tripartite quantum entanglement have also been found.

into account the principal nonlinear mechanisms of the large-scale dynamo, such
as the magnetic helicity conservation, magnetic buoyancy, and effects of
magnetic forces on the angular momentum balance inside the convection zones.
Also, we consider two types of the dynamo models. The distributed (D-type)
models employ the standard alpha-effect distributed on the whole convection
zone. The ""boundary"" (B-type) models employ the non-local alpha- effect, which
is confined to the boundaries of the convection zone. Both the D- and B-type

effect for the nonlinear quenching of the dynamo. This quenching is more
efficient in the B-type than in the D-type dynamo models. The D-type dynamo
reproduces the observed dependence of the cycle period on the rotation rate for
the Sun analogs. For the solar analog rotating with a period of 15 days we find
nonlinear dynamo regimes with multiply cycles.

chains. For this purpose, in the framework of matrix product states (MPSs), we
propose an effective procedure to calculate GQD (denoted as Gn) for consecutive
n-site subchains in infinite chains. For a spin-1/2 three-body interaction
model, whose ground state can be exactly expressed as MPSs, We use the
procedure to study Gn with n up to $24$. Then for a spin-1/2 XXZ chain, we
firstly use infinite time-evolving block decimation (iTEBD) algorithm to obtain
the approximate wavefunction in the from of MPSs, and then figure out Gn with n
up to $18$. In both models, Gn shows an interesting linear growth as the
increase of n, that is, Gn = k*n+b. Moreover, in non-critical regions the slope
$k$ of Gn converges very fast, while in critical regions it converges
relatively slow, and the behaviors are explained in a clear physical picture
with the short-range and long-range correlations. Based on these results, we
propose to use Gn/n to describe the global correlations in infinite chains.
Gn/n has twofold physical meanings. Firstly, it can be regarded as ""global
discord per site"", very similar to ""energy per site"" or ""magnetization per
site"" in quantum magnetic systems. Secondly, Gn/n (when n is large enough)
describes the quantum correlation between a single site and an (n-1)-site
block. Then we successfully apply our theory to an exactly soluble
infinite-size spin XY chain which is beyond the matrix product formula, and the
Hamiltonian can reduce to the transverse-field Ising model and the XX model.
The relation between GQD and quantum phase transitions in these models is
discussed.

build complex feedback networks via interconnections, serial products and

encountered. In the case of slipping walls, as expected, we obtain an
exponential decay, which, however, does not scale with the Lyapunov exponent.
Using a simple model, we suggest that this decay is related to the negative
eigenvalues of the fixed points of the flow. When no-slip walls are considered,
as predicted by the model, the behavior is radically dfferent, with a very
large tail following a power law with an exponent close to -3.

The Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) of excitons and polaritons is one of such
coherent phases, which can potentially crossover into the
Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) type ordered phase at high densities under
quasi-equilibrium conditions, known as the BCS-BEC crossover. In contrast, one
can find the semiconductor laser, superfluorescence (SF), and superradiance as
relevant phenomena under nonequilibrium conditions. In this paper, we present a
comprehensive generating functional theory that yields nonequilibrium Green's
functions in a rigorous way. The theory gives us a starting point to discuss
these phases in a unified view with a diagrammatic technique. Comprehensible
time-dependent equations are derived within the Hartree-Fock approximation,
which generalize the Maxwell-Semiconductor-Bloch equations under the relaxation
time approximation. With the help of this formalism, we clarify the
relationship among these cooperative phenomena and we show theoretically that
the Fermi-edge SF is directly connected to the e-h BCS phase. We also discuss
the emission spectra as well as the gain-absorption spectra.

superconductivity can survive a low DOS if the FS is simple enough.

modes in underdoped cuprates, where short coherence length is a probable
obstacle for long-range superconductivity. Thermal disorder is recognized as a

dynamics of glasses postulates the temporary coexistence of two phases
characterized by a high and by a low diffusivity. In this scenario, two phases
with different diffusivities coexist for a time of the order of the relaxation
time and mix afterwards. Unfortunately, it is difficult to measure the
single-particle diffusivities to test this hypothesis. Indeed, although the
non-Gaussian shape of the van-Hove distribution suggests the transient
existence of a diffusivity distribution, it is not possible to infer from this
quantity whether two or more dynamical phases coexist. Here we provide the
first direct observation of the dynamical coexistence of two phases with
different diffusivities, by showing that in the deeply supercooled regime the
distribution of the single-particle diffusivities acquires a transient bimodal
shape. We relate this distribution to the heterogeneity of the dynamics and to
the breakdown of the Stokes-Einstein relation, and we show that the coexistence
of two dynamical phases occurs up to a timescale growing faster than the
relaxation time on cooling, for some of the considered models. Our work offers
a basis for rationalizing the dynamics of supercooled liquids and for relating
their structural and dynamical properties.

principle. We construct a theoretical model of diffusion that can explain the
inward diffusion in a dipole magnetic field. The key is the identification of
the proper coordinates on which an appropriate diffusion operator can be
formulated. The effective phase space is foliated by the adiabatic invariants;
on the symplectic leaf, the invariant measure (by which the entropy must be
calculated) is distorted, by the inhomogeneous magnetic field, with respect to
the conventional Lebesgue measure of the natural phase space. The collision
operator is formulated to be consistent to the ergodic hypothesis on the
symplectic leaf, i.e., the resultant diffusion must diminish gradients on the
proper coordinates. The non-orthogonality of the cotangent vectors of the
configuration space causes a coupling between the perpendicular and parallel
diffusions, which is derived by applying Ito's formula of changing variables.
The model has been examined by numerical simulations. We observe the creation
of a peaked density profile that mimics radiation belts in planetary
magnetospheres as well as laboratory experiments.

intermediate nodes combine the messages they receive and forward the
combinations towards their destinations. The solvability problem asks whether
the demands of all the destinations can be simultaneously satisfied by using
linear network coding. The guessing number approach converts this problem to
determining the number of fixed points of coding functions $f:A^n\to A^n$ over
a finite alphabet $A$ (usually referred to as Boolean networks if $A =
\{0,1\}$) with a given interaction graph, that describes which local functions
depend on which variables. In this paper, we generalise the so-called reduction
of coding functions in order to eliminate variables. We then determine the
maximum number of fixed points of a fully reduced coding function, whose
interaction graph has a loop on every vertex. Since the reduction preserves the
number of fixed points, we then apply these ideas and results to obtain four
main results on the linear network coding solvability problem. First, we prove
that non-decreasing coding functions cannot solve any more instances than
routing already does. Second, we show that triangle-free undirected graphs are
linearly solvable if and only if they are solvable by routing. This is the
first classification result for the linear network coding solvability problem.
Third, we exhibit a new class of non-linearly solvable graphs. Fourth, we
determine large classes of strictly linearly solvable graphs.

  Aims: Our goal is to better understand the surface composition of Ceres, and
to constrain the presence of exposed water ice.
  Methods: We acquired new visible and near-infrared spectra at the Telescopio
Nazionale Galileo (TNG, La Palma, Spain), and reanalyzed literature spectra in
the 3-$\mu$m region.
  Results: We obtained the first rotationally-resolved spectroscopic
observations of Ceres at visible wavelengths. Visible spectra taken one month
apart at almost the same planetocentric coordinates show a significant slope
variation (up to 3 %/10$^3\AA$). A faint absorption centered at 0.67 $\mu$m,
possibly due to aqueous alteration, is detected in a subset of our spectra. The
various explanations in the literature for the 3.06-$\mu$m feature can be
interpreted as due to a variable amount of surface water ice at different
epochs.
  Conclusions: The remarkable short-term temporal variability of the visible
spectral slope, and the changing shape of the 3.06-$\mu$m band, can be hints of
different amounts of water ice exposed on the surface of Ceres. This would be
in agreement with the recent detection by the Herschel Space Observatory of
localized and transient sources of water vapour over this dwarf planet.

evolution processes within various related organisms paid a lot of attention
these last decades. However, accurate methodologies are still needed to
discover genes content evolution. In a previous work, two novel approaches
based on sequence similarities and genes features have been proposed. More
precisely, we proposed to use genes names, sequence similarities, or both,
insured either from NCBI or from DOGMA annotation tools. Dogma has the
advantage to be an up-to-date accurate automatic tool specifically designed for
chloroplasts, whereas NCBI possesses high quality human curated genes (together
with wrongly annotated ones). The key idea of the former proposal was to take
the best from these two tools. However, the first proposal was limited by name
variations and spelling errors on the NCBI side, leading to core trees of low
quality. In this paper, these flaws are fixed by improving the comparison of
NCBI and DOGMA results, and by relaxing constraints on gene names while adding
a stage of post-validation on gene sequences. The two stages of similarity
measures, on names and sequences, are thus proposed for sequence clustering.
This improves results that can be obtained using either NCBI or DOGMA alone.
Results obtained with this quality control test are further investigated and
compared with previously released ones, on both computational and biological
aspects, considering a set of 99 chloroplastic genomes.

the possible stellar magnetic fields present in PACWB to provide constraints
for models. We gathered 21 high-resolution spectropolarimetric observations of
9 PACWB available in the ESPaDOnS, Narval and HarpsPol archives. We analysed
these observations with the Least Squares Deconvolution method. We separated
the binary spectral components when possible. No magnetic signature is detected
in any of the 9 PACWB stars and all longitudinal field measurements are
compatible with 0 G. We derived the upper field strength of a possible field

not very constraining for some stars, for several stars we could derive an
upper limit of the polar field strength of the order of 200 G. We can therefore
exclude the presence of strong or moderate stellar magnetic fields in PACWB,
typical of the ones present in magnetic massive stars. Weak magnetic fields

customers that will enter the queue (require service) only once, also known as
the $\Delta_{(i)}/G/1$ queue. This paper presents a method for analyzing
heavy-traffic behavior by using uniform acceleration, which simultaneously lets
$n$ and the service rate grow large, while the initial resource utilization
approaches one. A key feature of the model is that, as time progresses, more
customers have joined the queue, and fewer customers can potentially join. This
diminishing population gives rise to a class of reflected stochastic processes
that vanish over time, and hence do not have a stationary distribution. We
establish that, when the arrival times are exponentially distributed, by
suitably rescaling space and time, the queue length process converges to a
Brownian motion with parabolic drift, a stochastic-process limit that captures
the effect of a diminishing population by a negative quadratic drift. When the
arrival times are generally distributed, our techniques provide information on
the typical queue length and the first busy period.

charge carriers and femtosecond pump-probe spectroscopy to follow the CPG
dynamics. We find that intitial photoexcitation yields a branching between
excitons and charge carriers, followed by excitation energy dependent hot
exciton dissociation as an additional CPG mechanism. Based on these findings,
we make simple suggestions for the design of more efficient MoS2 photovoltaic
and photodetector devices.

downlink performance of a two-tier heterogeneous LTE network (consisting of
macro and femto tiers) in terms of rate distribution, i.e. the percentage of
users that achieve certain rate in the system. The paper specifically
addresses: (1) the femto tier RRM by randomization of the allocated resources;
(2) the user association process by introducing novel proactive offloading
scheme and (3) femto tier access control. System level simulation results show
that an optimal RRM strategy can be designed for different scenarios (e.g.
congested and uncongested networks). The proposed proactive offloading scheme
in the association phase improves the performance of congested networks by
efficiently utilizing the available femto tier resources. Finally, the
introduced hybrid access in femto tier is shown to perform nearly identical as
the open access.

proteins attached on to a cargo engage in pulling activity, often leading to
tug-of-war, displaying bidirectional motion. However, most mathematical and
computational models ignore the details of the motor-cargo interaction. Here,
we study a generic model in which N motors are elastically coupled to a cargo,
which itself is subjected to thermal noise in the cytoplasm and to an
additional external applied force. The motor-hopping rates are chosen to
satisfy detailed balance with respect to the energy of elastic stretching. With
these assumptions, an (N+1)-variable master equation is constructed for
dynamics of the motor-cargo complex. By expanding the hopping rates to linear
order in fluctuations in motor positions, we obtain a linear Fokker-Planck
equation. The deterministic equations governing the average quantities are
separated out and explicit analytical expressions are obtained for the mean
velocity and diffusion coefficient of the cargo. We also study the statistical
features of the force experienced by an individual motor and quantitatively
characterize the load-sharing among the cargo-bound motors. The mean cargo
velocity and the effective diffusion coefficient are found to be decreasing
functions of the stiffness. While increase in the number of motors N does not
increase the velocity substantially, it decreases the effective diffusion
coefficient which falls as 1/N asymptotically. We further show that the
cargo-bound motors share the force exerted on the cargo equally only in the
limit of vanishing elastic stiffness; as stiffness is increased, deviations
from equal load sharing are observed. Numerical simulations agree with our
analytical results where expected. Interestingly, we find in simulations that
the stall force of a cargo elastically coupled to motors is independent of the
stiffness.

Several models are considered, starting with the logis- tic regression which is
a standard approach in credit risk modelling. Some important improvements are
investigated. Generalised Extreme Value (GEV) regression is applied to correct
for the symmetric link function of the logistic regression. The assumption of
non-linearity is relaxed through application of BGEVA, non-parametric additive
model based on the GEV link function. Two methods of handling missing values
are compared: multiple imputation and Weights of Evidence (WoE) transformation.
The results suggest that the best predictive performance is obtained by BGEVA,
thus implying the necessity of taking into account the relative volume of
defaults and non-linear patterns when modelling SME performance. WoE for the
majority of models considered show better prediction as compared to multiple
imputation, suggesting that missing values could be informative and should not
be assumed to be missing at random.

lateral and vertical interlayer displacement. The variation of electronic
structure due to the lateral displacement is attributed to the changing of the
interlayer distance dz led by atomic layer corrugation, which is in a uniform
picture with vertical displacement. Despite different stacking configurations,
the change of in-direct band gap is proportional to dz-2. This stacking
configuration independent dz-2 law is found also works for other graphene-like
corrugated bi-layer materials, for example MoS2. By measuring the tunable
electronic structure using absorption spectroscopy, the nano-scale displacement
could be detected. BLBP represents a large family of bi-layer 2D atomic
corrugated materials for which the electronic structure is sensitive to the
interlayer vertical and lateral displacement, thus could be used for nano-scale
displacement sensor. Since this kind of sensor is established on atomic layers
coupled through VdW interaction, it provides unique applications in
measurements of nano-scale displacement induced by tiny external force.

they are genuine symmetries of the radiative phase space. In the presence of

of solar masses), intermediate-age (about one to three billion years old) star

more than 300 million years, although young clusters are thought to quickly
lose any remaining star-forming fuel following a period of rapid gas expulsion

made available to all users or used by its own users only. This may limit
network flexibility and performance. It is desirable for owners of femtocell

access. In such scenarios, spectrum and energy efficiency becomes a critical
issue in the design of femtocell network protocols and structure. In this
paper, we conduct performance analysis for two-tier femtocell networks with
partially open channels. In particular, we build a Markov chain to model the
channel access in the femtocell network and then derive the performance metrics
in terms of the blocking probabilities. Based on stationary state probabilities
derived by Markov chain models, spectrum and energy efficiency are modeled and
analyzed under different scenarios characterized by critical parameters,
including number of femtocells in a macrocell, average number of users, and
number of open channels in a femtocell. Numerical and Monte-Carlo (MC)

establish a converse showing that these ciphers are close to optimal. This is
in contrast to entropic security for which there is a gap between the lower and

processes $\bar D D\to\pi X(3872)$, $\bar D^* D\to \pi X(3872)$ and $\bar D^*
D^*\to\pi X(3872)$, information needed for calculations of the $X(3872)$
abundance in heavy ion collisions. Our formalism is based on the generation of
$X(3872)$ from the interaction of the hadrons $\bar D^0 D^{*0} - \textrm{c.c}$,
$D^- D^{*+} - \textrm{c.c}$ and $D^-_s D^{*+}_s - \textrm{c.c}$. The evaluation
of the cross section associated with processes having $D^*$ meson(s) involves
an anomalous vertex, $X\bar D^* D^*$, which we have determined by considering
triangular loops motivated by the molecular nature of $X(3872)$. We find that
the contribution of this vertex is important. Encouraged by this finding we
estimate the $X\bar D^* D^*$ coupling, which turns out to be $1.95\pm 0.22$. We
then use it to obtain the cross section for the reaction $\bar D^* D^*\to\pi X$
and find that the $X\bar D^* D^*$ vertex is also relevant in this case. We also
discuss the role of the charged components of $X$ in the determination of the
production cross sections.

have shown that a certain version of the random edge pivot rule solves linear

Even though the running time of our algorithm depends on $m$, it is
significantly faster for the important special case of totally unimodular

second kind in a 3D atmosphere model obtained from realistic MHD
(magneto-hydrodynamical) simulations. Maps of circular polarization were
calculated neglecting atomic polarization. Our investigation focuses on the
linear polarization signals induced by kinematics, radiation field anisotropy
and Hanle effect in forward-scattering geometry. Thus, instead of considering
slit profiles at the limb as normally done in the study of the second solar
spectrum, we synthetize and analyze spatial maps of polarization at disk
center. It allows us to understand the spatial signatures of dynamics and
magnetic field in the linear polarization for discriminating them
observationally. Our results suggest new ideas for chromospheric diagnosis that
will be developed throughout a serie of papers. In particular, Hanle Polarity
Inversion Lines and dynamic Hanle diagrams are two concepts introduced in the
present work. We find that chromospheric dynamics and magnetic field topology
create spatial fingerprints in the polarization maps that trace the dynamic
situation of the plasma and the magnetic field. Based on such spatial features
we reconstruct the magnetic field intensity in the middle chromosphere along
grooves of null linear polarization. We finally address the problems of
diagnosing Hanle saturation and kinematic amplification of scattering signals
using Hanle diagrams.

radio telescopes and a tremendous increase of their capabilities. Such systems
make mandatory the design of more sophisticated techniques not only for
transporting, storing and processing this new generation of radio
interferometric data, but also for restoring the astrophysical information
contained in such data. In this paper we present a new radio deconvolution
algorithm named MORESANE and its application to fully realistic simulated data
of MeerKAT, one of the SKA precursors. This method has been designed for the
difficult case of restoring diffuse astronomical sources which are faint in
brightness, complex in morphology and possibly buried in the dirty beam's side
lobes of bright radio sources in the field. MORESANE is a greedy algorithm
which combines complementary types of sparse recovery methods in order to
reconstruct the most appropriate sky model from observed radio visibilities. A
synthesis approach is used for the reconstruction of images, in which the
synthesis atoms representing the unknown sources are learned using analysis
priors. We apply this new deconvolution method to fully realistic simulations
of radio observations of a galaxy cluster and of an HII region in M31. We show
that MORESANE is able to efficiently reconstruct images composed from a wide
variety of sources from radio interferometric data. Comparisons with other
available algorithms, which include multi-scale CLEAN and the recently proposed
methods by Li et al. (2011) and Carrillo et al. (2012), indicate that MORESANE
provides competitive results in terms of both total flux/surface brightness
conservation and fidelity of the reconstructed model. MORESANE seems
particularly well suited for the recovery of diffuse and extended sources, as
well as bright and compact radio sources known to be hosted in galaxy clusters.

time series of GDP and Government Consumption Expenditures & Gross Investment
(GCEGI) from 1980 to 2013. The article is organized as: (I) Definition; (II)
Regression Models; (III) Discussion. Additionally, I discovered a unique
interaction between GDP and GCEGI in both the short-run and the long-run and
provided policy makers with some suggestions. For example in the short run, GDP
responded positively and very significantly (0.00248) to GCEGI, while GCEGI
reacted positively but not too significantly (0.08051) to GDP. In the long run,
current GDP responded negatively and permanently (0.09229) to a shock in past
GCEGI, while current GCEGI reacted negatively yet temporarily (0.29821) to a
shock in past GDP. Therefore, policy makers should not adjust current GCEGI
based merely on the condition of current and past GDP. Although increasing
GCEGI does help GDP in the short-term, significantly abrupt increase in GCEGI
might not be good to the long-term health of GDP. Instead, a balanced,
sustainable, and economically viable solution is recommended, so that the
short-term benefits to the current economy from increasing GCEGI often largely
secured by the long-term loan outweigh or at least equal to the negative effect
to the future economy from the long-term debt incurred by the loan. Finally, I
found that non-normally distributed volatility models generally perform better
than normally distributed ones. More specifically, TARCH-GED performs the best
in the group of non-normally distributed, while GARCH-M does the best in the
group of normally distributed.

  pp. 870-903","10.1137/141000403",,"math.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper we introduce universal asymptotic unfolding normal forms for
nonlinear singular systems. Next, we propose an approach to find the parameters
of a parametric singular system that they play the role of universal unfolding
parameters. These parameters effectively influence the local dynamics of the
system. We propose a systematic approach to locate local bifurcations in terms
of these parameters. Here, we apply the proposed approach on Hopf-zero
singularities whose the first few low degree terms are incompressible. In this
direction, we obtain novel orbital and parametric normal form results for such
families by assuming a nonzero quadratic condition. Moreover, we give a
truncated universal asymptotic unfolding normal form and prove the finite
determinacy of the steady-state bifurcations for two most generic subfamilies
of the associated amplitude systems. We analyze the local bifurcations of
equilibria, limit cycles and the secondary Hopf bifurcation of invariant tori.
The results are successfully implemented and verified using Maple. By employing
the proposed approach, we design an effective multiple-parametric quadratic
state feedback controller for a singular system on a three dimensional central
manifold with two imaginary uncontrollable modes. We illustrate how our program
systematically identifies the distinguished (universal unfolding) parameters,
derives the estimated transition varieties in terms of these parameters, and
locates the local primary and secondary bifurcations of equilibria, limit
cycles and invariant tori. This approach is useful in designing efficient
nonlinear feedback controllers (single or multiple inputs) for local
bifurcation control in engineering problems.

concern for a long time. This paper defines a string buffer overflow analysis
for C programs. The key ideas of our formulation are (a) separating buffers
from the pointers that point to them, (b) modelling buffers in terms of sizes
and sets of positions of null characters, and (c) defining stateless functions
to compute the sets of null positions and mappings between buffers and
pointers.
  This exercise has been carried out to test the feasibility of describing such
an analysis in terms of lattice valued functions and relations to facilitate
automatic construction of an analyser without the user having to write
C/C++/Java code. This is facilitated by devising stateless formulations because
stateful formulations combine features through side effects in states raising a
natural requirement of C/C++/Java code to be written to describe them. Given
the above motivation, the focus of this paper is not to build good static
approximations for buffer overflow analysis but to show how given static
approximations could be formalized in terms of stateless formulations so that
they become amenable to automatic construction of analysers.

sophisticated signals delivered by the short text make it a promising source
for topic modeling, its extreme sparsity and imbalance brings unprecedented
challenges to conventional topic models like LDA and its variants. Aiming at
presenting a simple but general solution for topic modeling in short texts, we
present a word co-occurrence network based model named WNTM to tackle the
sparsity and imbalance simultaneously. Different from previous approaches, WNTM
models the distribution over topics for each word instead of learning topics
for each document, which successfully enhance the semantic density of data
space without importing too much time or space complexity. Meanwhile, the rich
contextual information preserved in the word-word space also guarantees its
sensitivity in identifying rare topics with convincing quality. Furthermore,
employing the same Gibbs sampling with LDA makes WNTM easily to be extended to
various application scenarios. Extensive validations on both short and normal
texts testify the outperformance of WNTM as compared to baseline methods. And
finally we also demonstrate its potential in precisely discovering newly
emerging topics or unexpected events in Weibo at pretty early stages.

parameters and optical depths and performing Large Velocity Gradient radiative
transfer calculations, the aims of this study are (1) to evaluate physical
parameters of the absorbing foreground gas at z~0.89, in particular its
homogeneity, and (2) to monitor the spectroscopic time variability caused by
fluctuations of the z~2.5 background continuum source. We find, that the gas is
quite inhomogeneous with n(H2)~2 x 10^3 cm^-3 for most molecular species but
with higher values for H2CO and lower ones for SO. Measuring the CS J=1-0
transition during a time interval of more than a decade, from 2001 to 2012, the
peak absorption depth of the line remains approximately constant, while the
line shape undergoes notable variations. Covering the time between 1996 and
2013, CS, HCO+, and CH3OH data indicate maximal integrated optical depths in
~2001 and 2011/2012. This is compatible with a ~10 yr periodicity, which,
however, needs confirmation by substantially longer time monitoring. Comparing
molecular abundances with those of different types of Galactic and nearby
extragalactic clouds we find that the observed cloud complex does not
correspond to one particular type but to a variety of cloud types with more
diffuse and denser components as can be expected for an observed region with a
transverse linear scale of several parsec and a likely larger depth along the

coupling of each atom with the radiation field. We compute and analyze the
atom-atom entanglement, the entanglement between the two photon modes, and also
the entanglement between each atom and each photon mode. The measure of
entanglement is the von Neumann entropy. For the case in which the two
atom-photon systems have identical properties, but allowing for non-resonant
conditions, the sum of the atom-atom and photon-modes-entanglement is time
independent. The effect of detuning is to decrease the strength of the largest
entanglement achieved and to shorten the time for it to occur. The results
support the fact that the state of the photons after emergence from cavities is
entangled, notwithstanding its single-particle nature. In addition, for the
case of resonance and identical cavity parameters, we demonstrate that von

Recent
continuous and long monitoring campaigns revealed a large hard X-rays
variability amplitude with strong flares and off-states. This activity has been
interpreted invoking clumpy stellar winds and/or magnetic gating mechanisms.
  $Aims$: We are probing if the observed behaviour could be explained by
unstable hydrodynamic flows close to the neutron star rather than the more
exotic phenomena.
  $Methods$: We have used the hydrodynamic code VH-1 to simulate the flow of
the stellar wind with high temporal resolution and to compare the predicted
accretion rate with the observed light-curves.
  $Results$: The simulation results are similar to the observed variability.
Off-states are predicted with a duration of 5 to 120 minutes corresponding to
transient low density bubbles forming around the neutron star. Oscillations of
the accretion rate with a typical period of $\sim$ 6800 sec are generated in
our simulations and observed. They correspond to the complex motion of a bow
shock, moving either towards or away from the neutron star. Flares are also
produced by the simulations up to a level of $10^{37}$ erg/s.
  $Conclusions$: We have qualitatively reproduced the hard X-ray variations
observed in Vela X-1 with hydrodynamic instabilities predicted by a simple
model. More sophisticated phenomena, such as clumpy winds or the magnetic
gating mechanism, are not excluded but not required to explain the basic
phenomenology.

the CMB spectrum for magnetic fields that exist in the vicinity of magnetars is
quite large, this effect is very difficult to detect at present because the

wave of research on systemic risk analytics, yet it still faces challenges in
measurability. This paper models systemic risk by tapping into expert knowledge

interconnected segments, for which the level of vulnerability is measured. The
system is modeled in the form of a Fuzzy Cognitive Map (FCM), in which nodes
represent vulnerability in segments and links their interconnectedness. A main
problem tackled in this paper is the aggregation of values in different
interrelated nodes of the network to obtain an estimate systemic risk. To this
end, the Choquet integral is employed for aggregating expert evaluations of
measures, as it allows for the integration of interrelations among factors in
the aggregation process. The approach is illustrated through two applications
in a European setting. First, we provide an estimation of systemic risk with a
of pan-European set-up. Second, we estimate country-level risks, allowing for a
more granular decomposition. This sets a starting point for the use of the
rich, oftentimes tacit, knowledge in policy organizations.

can find out, for each value of central density, the unique value of central
curvature for which one has solutions with the required asymptotic
$R\rightarrow 0$ for $r\rightarrow\infty$. In another words, one needs a
fine-tuning for $R$ to achieve quark stars in $f(R)$ gravity. We consider also
the analogue description in corresponding scalar-tensor gravity. The
fine-tuning on $R$ is equivalent to the fine-tuning on the scalar field $\phi$

increases with increasing $\alpha$ ($\alpha>0$) but the interpretation of this
fact depends on frame where we work. Considering directly $f(R)$ gravity, one
can say that increasing of mass occurs by the ""gravitational sphere"" outside
the star with some ""effective mass"". On the other hand, in scalar-tensor
theory, we also have a dilaton sphere (or ""disphere"") outside the star but its
contribution to gravitational mass for distant observer is negligible. We show
that it is possible to discriminate modified theories of gravity from General

conversion is a tedious task when carried out manually and machining knowledge

benefit from more expressiveness of the manufacturing feature-based
characteristics of this new standard. The work presented here proposes an
overall method for G-code to STEP-NC conversion. First, G-code is converted
into canonical machining functions, this can make the method more applicable
and make subsequent processes easier to implement; then these functions are
parsed to generate the neutral format of STEP-NC Part21 toolpath file, this
turns G-code into object instances, and can facilitate company's usage of
legacy programs; and finally, also optionally, machining features are extracted
to generate Part21 CC2 (conformance class) file. The proposed extraction method
employs geometric information of cutting area inferred from toolpaths and
machining strategies, in addition to cutting tools' data and workpiece's
dimension data. This comprehensive use of available data makes the extraction
more accurate and reliable. The conversion method is holistic, and can be
extended to process a wide range of G-code programs (e.g. turning or mill-turn
codes) with as few user interventions as possible.

of the tree we achieve very strong edge fields, in particular at the top where
the star is located. Such edge fields, as here located at ion rich spots, makes
strong acceleration gradients possible. It also results in a nice, warm glow
suitable for the holiday season.

can be viewed as implementations of Bayes' law in distributed settings. Some of
the algorithms are proposed in the literature most recently, and others are
first developed in this paper. The common feature of these algorithms is that
they all combine (i) certain kinds of consensus protocols with (ii) Bayesian
updates. They are different mainly in the aspect of the type of consensus
protocol and the order of the two operations. After discussing their
similarities and differences, we compare these distributed algorithms by
numerical examples. We focus on the rate at which these algorithms detect the
underlying true state of an object. We find that (a) The algorithms with
consensus via geometric average is more efficient than that via arithmetic
average; (b) The order of consensus aggregation and Bayesian update does not
apparently influence the performance of the algorithms; (c) The existence of
communication delay dramatically slows down the rate of convergence; (d) More
communication between agents with different signal structures improves the rate
of convergence.

literature. In this paper, an energy efficiency model is first proposed for
multiple-input multiple-output orthogonal-frequency-division-multiplexing
(MIMO-OFDM) mobile multimedia communication systems with statistical QoS
constraints. Employing the channel matrix singular-value-decomposition (SVD)
method, all subchannels are classified by their channel characteristics.
Furthermore, the multi-channel joint optimization problem in conventional
MIMO-OFDM communication systems is transformed into a multi-target single
channel optimization problem by grouping all subchannels. Therefore, a
closed-form solution of the energy efficiency optimization is derived for
MIMO-OFDM mobile mlutimedia communication systems. As a consequence, an
energy-efficiency optimized power allocation (EEOPA) algorithm is proposed to
improve the energy efficiency of MIMO-OFDM mobile multimedia communication
systems. Simulation comparisons validate that the proposed EEOPA algorithm can
guarantee the required QoS with high energy efficiency in MIMO-OFDM mobile
multimedia communication systems.

of spectral decomposition) to analyze the bipartivity index of graphs as well
as to predict the set of vertices that will constitute the two partitions of
graphs that are truly bipartite and those that are close to being bipartite.
Though the largest eigenvalue and the corresponding eigenvector (called the
principal eigenvalue and principal eigenvector) are typically used in the
spectral analysis of network graphs, we show that the smallest eigenvalue and
the smallest eigenvector (called the bipartite eigenvalue and the bipartite
eigenvector) could be used to predict the bipartite partitions of network
graphs. For each of the predictions, we hypothesize an expected partition for
the input graph and compare that with the predicted partitions. We also analyze
the impact of the number of frustrated edges (edges connecting the vertices
within a partition) and their location across the two partitions on the
bipartivity index. We observe that for a given number of frustrated edges, if
the frustrated edges are located in the larger of the two partitions of the
bipartite graph (rather than the smaller of the two partitions or equally
distributed across the two partitions), the bipartivity index is likely to be
relatively larger.

Silicon-On-Insulator (SOI) pMOSFETs have been studied by comparing with those
of the back transistor of SOI nMOSFETs fabricated on the same wafer. The
transistors were irradiated by 60Co {\gamma}-rays with various doses, and the
front transistors are biased in a Float-State and Off-State, respectively,
during irradiation. The total dose radiation responses of the back transistors
are characterized by their threshold voltage shifts. The results show that the
total dose radiation response of the back transistor of SOI pMOSFETs, similar
to that of SOI nMOSFETs, depends greatly on their bias conditions during
irradiation. However, with the Float-State bias, rather than the Off-State
bias, the back transistors of SOI pMOSFETs reveal a much higher sensitivity to
total dose radiation, which is contrary to those of SOI nMOSFETs. In addition,
it is also found that the total dose radiation effect of the back transistor of
SOI pMOSFETs irradiated with Off-State bias, as well as that of the SOI
nMOSFETs, exhibits an increasing trend as the channel length decreases. The
annealing response of the back transistors after irradiation at room
temperature without bias, characterized by their threshold voltage shifts,
indicates that there is a relatively complex annealing mechanism associated
with channel length and type, bias condition during irradiation. In particular,
for all the transistors irradiated with Off-State bias, their back transistors
show an abnormal annealing effect during early annealing. All the results have
been discussed and analyzed in detail by the aid of simulation.

  and Modelling",,,,,"cond-mat.soft","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We show that the plastic deformation of snow under uniaxial compression is
characterized by complex spatio-temporal strain localization phenomena.
Deformation is characterized by repeated nucleation and propagation of
compaction bands. Compaction bands are also observed during the very first
stage of compression of solid foams where a single band moves across the sample
at approximately constant stress. However, snow differs from these materials as
repeated nucleation and propagation of bands occurs throughout the subsequent
hardening stage until the end of the deformation experiment. Band nucleation
and/or reflection of bands at the sample boundaries are accompanied by stress
drops which punctuate the stress strain curve. A constitutive model is proposed
which quantitatively reproduces all features of this oscillatory deformation
mode. To this end, a well-established compressive plasticity framework for
solid foams is generalized to account for shear softening behavior, time
dependence of microstructure (`rapid sintering') and non-locality of damage
processes in snow.

provided valuable fine-grained data over the grid. Analysis over these data can
provide insight into the health of the grid, thereby improving control over

data management system that supports input from multiple PMU data streams,
features an event-detection algorithm, and provides an efficient method for
retrieving archival data. The event-detection algorithm rapidly correlates
multiple PMU data streams, providing details on events occurring within the
power system. The event-detection algorithm feeds into a visualization
component, allowing operators to recognize events as they occur. The indexing
and data retrieval mechanism facilitates fast access to archived PMU data.
Using this method, we achieved over 30x speedup for queries with high
selectivity. With the development of these two components, we have developed a
system that allows efficient analysis of multiple time-aligned PMU data
streams.

learning the underlying dependencies between labels, and to take advantage of
this at classification time. Developing better feature-space representations
has been predominantly employed to reduce complexity, e.g., by eliminating
non-helpful feature attributes from the input space prior to (or during)
training. This is an important task, since many multi-label methods typically
create many different copies or views of the same input data as they transform
it, and considerable memory can be saved by taking advantage of redundancy. In
this paper, we show that a proper development of the feature space can make
labels less interdependent and easier to model and predict at inference time.
