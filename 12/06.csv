of marked metric measure spaces (mmm-spaces). If an mmm-space admits a mark
function, we call it functionally-marked metric measure space (fmm-space). This
is not a closed property in the usual marked Gromov-weak topology, and thus we
put particular emphasis on the question under which conditions it carries over
to a limit. We obtain criteria for deterministic mmm-spaces as well as random
mmm-spaces and mmm-space-valued processes. As an example, our criteria are
applied to prove that the tree-valued Fleming-Viot dynamics with mutation and
selection from [Depperschmidt, Greven, Pfaffelhuber, Ann. Appl. Probab. '12]
admits a mark function at all times, almost surely. Thereby, we fill a gap in a
former proof of this fact, which used a wrong criterion.
  Furthermore, the subspace of fmm-spaces, which is dense and not closed, is
investigated in detail. We show that there exists a metric that induces the
marked Gromov-weak topology on this subspace and is complete. Therefore, the
space of fmm-spaces is a Polish space. We also construct a decomposition into
closed sets which are related to the case of uniformly equicontinuous mark
functions.

of dimensional constants such as c or G on which a good many (in my opinion,

Lagrange multiplier and another playing the role of the velocity potential.
That model arises naturally in some gravitational frameworks, e.g., the mimetic
dark matter scenario. We consider an extension of the model by means of higher
derivative terms, such that the dust solutions are preserved at the background
level, but there is a non-zero sound speed at the linear level. We associate
this {\it Modified Dust} with dark matter, and study the linear evolution of
cosmological perturbations in that picture. The most prominent effect is the
suppression of their power spectrum for sufficiently large cosmological
momenta. This can be relevant in view of the problems that cold dark matter
faces at sub-galactic scales, e.g., the missing satellites problem. At even
shorter scales, however, perturbations of Modified Dust are enhanced compared
to the predictions of more common particle dark matter scenarios. This is a
peculiarity of their evolution in radiation dominated background. We also
briefly discuss clustering of Modified Dust. We write the system of equations

the appearance of caustic singularities. The same mechanism may be relevant in

are up to a factor of about 3 lower than LTE values. Helium is found to be
stratified in the atmosphere of kap Cnc. While the LTE analysis indicates a

indicated by the NLTE analysis. A 3He/4He ratio of about 0.25-0.30 is found.

quantities in the canonical ensemble formalism will be shown in detail with
explicit examples. Attention will be given mainly to the thermodynamical
consequences of string degrees of freedom, where I will especially address i)
the Hagedorn temperature, a critical temperature above which the canonical
ensemble description breaks down, which can be the onset point of some
instability of the string gas; ii) the phase structure arising from
compactification, embodied in the moduli-dependence of the Helmholtz free
energy, which corrects the tree-level vacuum and can provide mechanism for
moduli stabilization. Then I will briefly explain the implementation of string
gas thermodynamics in cosmology, showing a simple example which gives rise to a
radiation-dominated early universe. Further phenomenological issues and open
questions will be discussed qualitatively with references indicated, including
the Hagedorn instability in the resolution of the initial singularity, moduli
stabilization, generation of hierarchy, radiative symmetry breaking and

to anyone who has dealt with the academic job market, for example - is deciding
what caliber of candidates to pursue. Should the firm try to increase its
reputation by making offers to higher-quality candidates, despite the risk that
the candidates might reject the offers and leave the firm empty-handed? Or
should it concentrate on weaker candidates who are more likely to accept the
offer? The question acquires an added level of complexity once we take into
account the effect one hiring cycle has on the next: hiring better employees in
the current cycle increases the firm's reputation, which in turn increases its
attractiveness for higher-quality candidates in the next hiring cycle. These
considerations introduce an interesting temporal dynamic aspect to the rich
line of research on matching models for job markets, in which long-range
planning and evolving reputational effects enter into the strategic decisions
made by competing firms.
  We develop a model based on two competing firms to try capturing as cleanly
as possible the elements that we believe constitute the strategic tension at
the core of the problem: the trade-off between short-term recruiting success
and long-range reputation-building; the inefficiency that results from
underemployment of people who are not ranked highest; and the influence of
earlier accidental outcomes on long-term reputations.
  Our model exhibits all these phenomena in a stylized setting, governed by a
parameter q that captures the difference in strength between the two top
candidates in each hiring cycle. We show that when q is relatively low the
efficiency of the job market is improved by long-range reputational effects,
but when q is relatively high, taking future reputations into account can
sometimes reduce the efficiency.

that contains 99 of the closest AGN with redshift z<=0.06 fills the gap between
the local AGN population and high-redshift QSOs that is essential to understand
the AGN evolution with redshift. In this paper, we present the results of
near-infrared H+K-integral field spectroscopy of the inner kiloparsecs of the
LLQSO HE 1029-1831 with SINFONI. Line maps show that ionized hydrogen gas is
located in spiral arms within the stellar bar and in a circumnuclear ring. Line
fluxes and diagnostic line ratios indicate recent or ongoing star formation in
the circumnuclear region and the presence of young and intermediate-age stellar
populations in the bulge. In particular, we find traces of an intense starburst
in the circumnuclear region that has begun around 100 Myr ago but has declined
to a fraction of the maximum intensity now. We estimate the dynamical bulge
mass and find that the galaxy follows published M_BH-M_bulge relations.
However, bulge-disk decomposition of the K-band image with BUDDA reveals that
HE 1029-1831 does not follow the M_BH-L_bulge relations of inactive galaxies.
We conclude that the deviation from M_BH-L_bulge relations of inactive galaxies
in this source is rather caused by young stellar populations and not by an
undermassive black hole.

of embedded sensors. Additionally, bluetooth connectivity can be leveraged to
collect data from external sensors, greatly extending the sensing capabilities.
However, massive data-gathering using smartphones still poses many
architectural challenges, such as limited battery and processing power, and
possibly connectivity costs.
  This article describes SenseMyCity (SMC), an Internet of Things mobile urban
sensor that is extensible and fully configurable. The platform consists of an
app, a backoffice and a frontoffice. The SMC app can collect data from embedded
sensors, like GPS, wifi, accelerometer, magnetometer, etc, as well as from
external bluetooth sensors, ranging from On-Board Diagnostics gathering data
from vehicles, to wearable cardiac sensors. Adding support for new internal or
external sensors is straightforward due to the modular architecture. Data
transmission to our servers can occur either on-demand or in real-time, while
keeping costs down by only using the configured type of Internet connectivity.
We discuss our experience implementing the platform and using it to make
longitudinal studies with many users. Further, we present results on bandwidth
utilization and energy consumption for different sensors and sampling rates.
Finally, we show two use cases: mapping fuel consumption and user stress
extracted from cardiac sensors.

star that displays bipolar molecular outflows accelerated up to 400 km/s. OH231
also presents an exceptional molecular richness probably due to shock-induced
chemical processes. We report the first detection in this source of HNCO, HNCS,
HC3N and NO, with the IRAM-30m telescope in a sensitive mm-wavelength survey
towards this target. HNCO and HNCS are also first detections in CSEs. The
observed line profiles show that the emission arises in the massive central
component of the envelope and at the base of the fast lobes. The NO profiles
are broader than those of HNCO, HNCS, and HC3N, and most importantly, broader
than the line profiles of 13CO. This indicates that the NO abundance is
enhanced in the fast lobes relative to the slow, central parts. From LTE and
non-LTE excitation analysis, we estimate beam-average rotational temperatures
of 15-30 K (and, maybe, up to 55 K for HC3N) and fractional abundances of
X(HNCO)=[0.8-1]E-7, X(HNCS)=[0.9-1]E-8, X(HC3N)=[5-7]E-9 and X(NO)=[1-2]E-6. NO
is, therefore, amongst the most abundant N-bearing species in OH231. We have
performed thermodynamical chemical equilibrium and chemical kinetics models to
investigate the formation of these N-bearing species in OH231. The model
underestimates the observed abundances for HNCO, HNCS, and HC3N by several
orders of magnitude, which indicates that these molecules can hardly be
products of standard UV-photon and/or cosmic-ray induced chemistry in OH231,
and that other processes (e.g. shocks) play a major role in their formation.
For NO, the model abundance is compatible with the observed average value. The
new detections presented in this work corroborate the particularly rich
chemistry of OH231, which is likely profoundly influenced by shock-induced
processes, as proposed in earlier works.

chapter is dedicated to the study of the structure coefficients in the general
cases of centers of group algebras and double-class algebras. We recall in it
the representation theory of finite groups and its link with structure
coefficients. We show also that the study of the structure coefficients of
double-class algebras is related to the theory of Gelfand pairs and zonal
spherical functions by giving, in the case of Gelfand pairs, a theorem similar
to that of Frobenius which writes the structure coefficients of the
double-class algebra associated to a Gelfand pair in terms of zonal spherical
functions. In the second chapter, we recall the Farahat and Higman's theorem
about the polynomiality of the structure coefficients of the center of the
symmetric group algebra as well as the Ivanov and Kerov's approach to prove
this theorem. We give a combinatorial proof to the polynomiality property of
the structure coefficients of the Hecke algebra of the pair $(S_{2n},B_n)$ in
the third chapter. Our proof uses a universal algebra which projects on the
Hecke algebra of $(S_{2n}, B_n)$ for each $n.$ We show that this universal
algebra is isomorphic to the algebra of $2$-shifted symmetric functions. In the
fourth and last chapter we build a general framework which gives us the form of
the structure coefficients in the case of a sequence of double-class algebras.
This framework implies the polynomiality property of the structure coefficients
of both the center of the symmetric group algebra and the Hecke algebra of
$(S_{2n},B_n).$ In addition, we give a polynomiality property for the structure
coefficients of both the center of the hyperoctahedral group algebra and the
double-class algebra of $diag(S_{n-1})$ in $S_n\times S_{n-1}^{opp}.$

(BRW) is routinely exploited for photon-pair generation in the
telecommunication range. Contrary to many conventional PDC sources, BRWs offer
possibilities to create spectrally broadband but nevertheless indistinguishable
photon pairs in orthogonal polarizations that simultaneously incorporate high
frequency entanglement. We explore the characteristics of co-propagating twin
beams created in a type-II ridge BRW. Our PDC source is bright and efficient,
which serves as a benchmark of its performance and justifies its exploitation
for further use in quantum photonics. We then examine the coalescence of the
twin beams and investigate the effect of their inevitable multi-photon
contributions on the observed photon bunching. Our results show that BRWs have
a great potential for producing broadband indistinguishable photon pairs as

  films","523 pages, 215 figures, 10 chapters",,,,"cond-mat.mtrl-sci","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Nanometallic devices based on amorphous insulator-metal thin films are
developed to provide a novel non-volatile resistance-switching random-access
memory (RRAM). In these devices, data recording is controlled by a bipolar
voltage, which tunes electron localization length, thus resistivity, through
electron trapping/detrapping. The low-resistance state is a metallic state
while the high-resistance state is an insulating state, as established by
conductivity studies from 2K to 300K. The material is exemplified by a Si3N4
thin film with randomly dispersed Pt or Cr. It has been extended to other
materials, spanning a large library of oxide and nitride insulator films,
dispersed with transition and main-group metal atoms. Nanometallic RRAMs have
superior properties that set them apart from other RRAMs. The critical
switching voltage is independent of the film thickness/device
area/temperature/switching speed. Trapped electrons are relaxed by
electron-phonon interaction, adding stability which enables long-term memory
retention. As electron-phonon interaction is mechanically altered, trapped
electron can be destabilized, and sub-picosecond switching has been
demonstrated using an electromagnetically generated stress pulse. AC impedance
spectroscopy confirms the resistance state is spatially uniform, providing a
capacitance that linearly scales with area and inversely scales with thickness.
The spatial uniformity is also manifested in outstanding uniformity of
switching properties. Device degradation, due to moisture, electrode oxidation
and dielectrophoresis, is minimal when dense thin films are used or when a
hermetic seal is provided. The potential for low power operation, multi-bit
storage and complementary stacking have been demonstrated in various RRAM
configurations.

multimode optomechanical system, where a low damping mechanical mode in the
unresolved-sideband regime is made to couple to an intermediate, high frequency

optical delay and higher transmission, as well as optical advancing are

metallicities that are consistent with the colors of resolved red giant branch
stars in the disk. The nucleus has a luminosity-weighted age at visible
wavelengths of ~1 Gyr, and the integrated light is dominated by stars that
formed over a time period of only a few hundred Myr. For comparison, the
luminosity-weighted ages of the bulge and disk are ~2 Gyr and ~10 Gyr,
respectively. The g'-[3.6] colors of the nucleus and bulge are consistent with
the spectroscopically-based ages. In contrast to the nucleus, models that
assume star-forming activity spanning many Gyr provide a better match to the
spectra of the bulge and disk than simple stellar population models. Isophotes
in the bulge have a disky shape, hinting that the bulge was assembled from
material with significant rotational support. The star-forming histories of the

the box orbits. However, we show that the method can be used to recover the
observables of triaxial systems from given distribution functions to sufficient
accuracy for the Jeans equations to be satisfied. Consequently, such models
could be used to build models of external galaxies as well as triaxial

settling accretion stage, magnetic reconnection can temporarily enhance the
magnetospheric plasma entry rate, resulting in copious production of X-ray
photons, strong Compton cooling, and ultimately in unstable accretion of the
entire shell. A bright flare develops on the free-fall time scale in the shell,
$R_B^{3/2}/\sqrt{GM}\sim 10^3-10^4$~s ($R_B$ is the classical Bondi capture
radius), and the typical energy released in an SFXT bright flare corresponds to
the mass of the shell.

As a by-product of our approach, we introduce the notion of ""Schur Lifting"" of

combinatorial optimization problems) in our axiomatic generalization. We also
generalize the notion of complements of graphs to diagonally scaling-invariant
polyhedral cones. Finally, we provide a weighted generalization of the

complex to understand and use. Using that fact as motivation, a much simpler

known results, like that types have a groupoidal structure. We also interpret
more complicated structures, like the one formed by a rewrite of a sequence of

subject of immense interest recently, due to its high carrier mobilities and a
tunable bandgap. So far, tunability has been predicted to be obtained with very
high compressive/tensile in-plane strains, and vertical electric field, which
are difficult to achieve experimentally. Here, we show using density functional
theory based calculations the possibility of tuning electronic properties by
applying normal compressive strain in bilayer phosphorene. A complete and fully
reversible semiconductor to metal transition has been observed at $\sim13.35\%$
strain, which can be easily realized experimentally. Furthermore, a direct to
indirect bandgap transition has also been observed at $\sim3\%$ strain, which
is a signature of unique band-gap modulation pattern in this material. The
absence of negative frequencies in phonon spectra as a function of strain
demonstrates the structural integrity of the sheets at relatively higher strain
range. The carrier mobilities and effective masses also do not change
significantly as a function of strain, keeping the transport properties nearly
unchanged. This inherent ease of tunability of electronic properties without
affecting the excellent transport properties of phosphorene sheets is expected
to pave way for further fundamental research leading to phosphorene-based
multi-physics devices.

good agreement achieved for interferometric measurements at spatial frequencies

into two categories: distributed offline routing problems where all the
requests that need to be visited are known from the start; distributed online
routing problems where the requests come to be known incrementally. A critical
and novel feature of our formulations is that communications are not allowed
among the servers, hence posing an interesting and challenging question: what
performance can be achieved in comparison to the best possible solution
obtained from an omniscience planner with perfect communication capabilities?
The worst-case (over all possible request-set instances) performance metrics
are given by the approximation ratio (offline case) and the competitive ratio
(online case).
  Our first result indicates that the online and offline problems are
effectively equivalent: for the same request-set instance, the approximation
ratio and the competitive ratio differ by at most an additive factor of 2,
irrespective of the release dates in the online case. Therefore, we can
restrict our attention to the offline problem. For the offline problem, we show
that the approximation ratio given by the Voronoi partition is m (the number of
servers). For two classes of depot configurations, when the depots form a line
and when the ratios between the distances of pairs of depots are upper bounded
by a sublinear function f(m) (i.e., f(m) = o(m)), we give partition schemes
with sublinear approximation ratios O(log m) and {\Theta}(f(m)) respectively.

method and its variant, the uniform smoothing level (USL) method, have optimal
iteration complexity for solving black-box and structured convex programming
problems without requiring the input of any smoothness information. However,
these algorithms require the assumption on the boundedness of the feasible set
and their efficiency relies on the solutions of two involved subproblems. These
hindered the applicability of these algorithms in solving large-scale and
unconstrained optimization problems. In this paper, we first present a generic
algorithmic framework to extend these uniformly optimal level methods for
solving unconstrained problems. Moreover, we introduce two new variants of
level methods, i.e., the fast APL (FAPL) method and the fast USL (FUSL) method,
for solving large scale black-box and structured convex programming problems
respectively. Both FAPL and FUSL enjoy the same optimal iteration complexity as
APL and USL, while the number of subproblems in each iteration is reduced from
two to one. Moreover, we present an exact method to solve the only subproblem
for these algorithms. As a result, the proposed FAPL and FUSL methods have
improved the performance of the APL and USL in practice significantly in terms
of both computational time and solution quality. Our numerical results on
solving some large-scale least square problems and total variation based image
reconstruction have shown great advantages of these new bundle-level type
methods over APL, USL, and some other state-of-the-art first-order methods.

particles with small but non-zero thermal velocities and tiny interaction
cross-sections. A generic consequence of these attributes is the suppression of
small-scale matter perturbations either due to free-streaming or due to
interactions with the primordial plasma. The suppression scale can vary over
many orders of magnitude depending on particle candidate and production
mechanism in the early Universe. While nonlinear structure formation has been
explored in great detail well above the suppression scale, the range around
suppressed perturbations is still poorly understood. In this paper we study
structure formation in the regime of suppressed perturbations using both
analytical techniques and numerical simulations. We develop simple and
theoretically motivated recipes for the halo mass function, the expected number
of satellites, and the halo concentrations, which are designed to work for
power spectra with suppression at arbitrary scale and of arbitrary shape. As
case studies, we explore warm and mixed dark matter scenarios where effects are
most distinctive. Additionally, we examine the standard dark matter scenario
based on weakly interacting massive particles (WIMP) and compare it to pure
cold dark matter with zero primordial temperature. We find that our
analytically motivated recipes are in good agreement with simulations for all

spherical galaxy within a Hubble time; an emerging picture is that galaxy
geometry, rotation, and large potential perturbations may usher the SMBH binary
through the critical three-body scattering phase and ultimately drive the SMBH
to coalesce. We explore the orbital content within an N-body model of a mildly-
flattened, non-rotating, SMBH-embedded elliptical galaxy. When used as the
foundation for a study on the SMBH binary coalescence, the black holes bypassed
the binary stalling often seen within spherical galaxies and merged on Gyr
timescales (Khan et al. 2013). Using both frequency-mapping and angular
momentum criteria, we identify a wealth of resonant orbits in the axisymmetric
model, including saucers, that are absent from an otherwise identical spherical
system and that can potentially interact with the binary. We quantified the set
of orbits that could be scattered by the SMBH binary, and found that the
axisymmetric model contained nearly seven times the number of these potential
loss cone orbits compared to our equivalent spherical model. In this flattened
model, the mass of these orbits is roughly 3 times of that of the SMBH, which
is consistent with what the SMBH binary needs to scatter to transition into the

on how planetesimals form---reflect a gravitational global mode in the gas

frequency; (2) of azimuthal wavenumber $m=1$, displacing the host star from the
barycenter; and (3) Toomre-stable. We solve for gas streamlines including the
indirect stellar potential in the frame rotating with the pattern speed, under
the drastic simplification that gas does not feel its own gravity. Near
co-rotation, the gas disk takes the form of a horseshoe-shaped annulus. Dust
particles with aerodynamic stopping times much shorter or much longer than the
orbital period are dragged by gas toward the horseshoe center. For intermediate
stopping times, dust converges toward a $\sim$45$^\circ$-wide arc on the
co-rotation circle. Particles that do not reach their final accumulation points
within disk lifetimes, either because of gas turbulence or long particle drift

self-consistent because we neglect gas self-gravity; still, we expect that
trends between accumulation location and particle size, similar to those we
have found, are generically predicted by fast modes and are potentially

particular region to monitor and collect data. A sink node moves to the
vicinity of the sensor nodes (within a few hops) to collect data. The collected
data is exchanged with peer mobile sinks. Thus, the MSSSN architecture provides
scalability, extends sensor lifetime by letting them operate with limited
transmission range and provides connectivity between isolated regions of sensor
nodes. In order to provide fault tolerance, more than one mobile sink could be
collecting data from a given region or a mobile sink could collect data from
more than one region. In the later half of the paper, we discuss several open

researchers. Despite the attractive benefits of integrating different wireless
platforms, mobile users are confronted with the issue of detrimental handover.
As a mobile node (MN) moves within a heterogeneous environment, satisfactory
quality of service (QoS) is desired by ensuring efficient vertical handover.
This demands not only the efficient execution of vertical handover, but also
optimized pre-handover decisions, such as: handover necessity estimation (HNE),
handover triggering condition estimation (HTCE) and handover target selection
(HTS). The existing works on HNE and HTCE optimization considered the coverage
region of a point of attachment to be circular, ignoring the fading effect.
This paper considers the effect of shadow fading and used extensive geometric
and probability analysis in modelling the coverage area of a WLAN cell. Thus,
presents a realistic and novel model with an attempt to ensure optimal handover
as a mobile node (MN) traverses a heterogeneous wireless environment.
Monte-Carlo simulations were carried out to show the behavior of the proposed
models. Results were validated by comparing the proposed models with existing
works.

Notification Message Dissemination Protocol (RNMDP) for vehicular ad hoc
networks (VANETs). RNMDP propagates Risk Notification Messages (RNMs) from
their location of origin (called the Risk Zone) to vehicles approaching the
Risk Zone. RNMDP assumes each node is aware of its current location in the
network. The protocol works as follows: A RNM is broadcast in the neighborhood
of the Risk Zone. A node receiving the RNM from another node waits for a
Rebroadcast-Wait-Time before deciding to rebroadcast the message. The
Rebroadcast-Wait-Time for a node is modeled based on the ratio of the distance
between the node and the immediate sender of the RNM and the direction of
movement of the node. Priority for rebroadcast is given for nodes farthest away
from the sender and traveling towards the Risk Zone. Nodes that are traveling
in lanes in direction away from the Risk Zone are also considered for
rebroadcast, albeit with a larger Rebroadcast-Wait-Time. During the
Rebroadcast-Wait-Time, if a node hears the same RNM again rebroadcast in the
neighborhood, then the node stops from further broadcasting the message. If a
node does not hear the RNM in its neighborhood during the RebroadcastWait-Time,
the node broadcasts the message in its neighborhood. A RNM is considered to
have been delivered to all the vehicles in the road, if the message reaches the
Target Zone. The performance of RNMDP has been compared with that of the
commonly used flooding strategy through extensive simulations conducted for
highway networks with different number of lanes and lane density. Simulation
results indicate that with a slightly larger delay (i.e., no more than 35% of
the delay incurred for flooding), RNMDP can achieve the same message delivery
ratio attained by flooding, but at a relatively much lower energy loss compared
to flooding.

constraints) that can be triangulated with at most n tetrahedra. Al- though
censuses are useful resources for mathematicians, constructing them is
difficult: the best algorithms to date have not gone beyond n = 12. The
underlying algorithms essentially (i) enumerate all relevant 4-regular
multigraphs on n nodes, and then (ii) for each multigraph G they enumerate
possible 3-manifold triangulations with G as their dual 1-skeleton, of which
there could be exponentially many. In practice, a small number of multigraphs
often dominate the running times of census algorithms: for example, in a
typical census on 10 tetrahedra, almost half of the running time is spent on
just 0.3% of the graphs.
  Here we present a new algorithm for stage (ii), which is the computational
bottleneck in this process. The key idea is to build triangulations by
recursively constructing neighbourhoods of edges, in contrast to traditional
algorithms which recursively glue together pairs of tetrahedron faces. We
implement this algorithm, and find experimentally that whilst the overall
performance is mixed, the new algorithm runs significantly faster on those
""pathological"" multigraphs for which existing methods are extremely slow. In
this way the old and new algorithms complement one another, and together can
yield significant performance improvements over either method alone.

are a number of close parallels between the contact graph and the curve graph,
including hyperbolicity, acylindricity of the action, the existence of
hierarchy paths, and a Masur--Minsky-style distance formula.
  We then define a \emph{hierarchically hyperbolic space}; the class of such
spaces includes a wide class of cubical groups (including all virtually compact
special groups) as well as mapping class groups and Teichm\""{u}ller space with
any of the standard metrics. We deduce a number of results about these spaces,
all of which are new for cubical or mapping class groups, and most of which are
new for both. We show that the quasi-Lipschitz image from a ball in a nilpotent
Lie group into a hierarchically hyperbolic space lies close to a product of
hierarchy geodesics. We also prove a rank theorem for hierarchically hyperbolic
spaces; this generalizes results of Behrstock--Minsky, Eskin--Masur--Rafi,
Hamenst\""{a}dt, and Kleiner. We finally prove that each hierarchically
hyperbolic group admits an acylindrical action on a hyperbolic space. This
acylindricity result is new for cubical groups, in which case the hyperbolic

class group, this provides a new proof of a theorem of Bowditch.

recorded by the Yohkoh telescopes, together with the patrol SOHO/EIT images,
allowed us to identify magnetic structures responsible for particular periods
and to propose an overall scenario which is consistent with the available
observations. Namely, we suggest that emerging magnetic flux initiated the
reconnection with legs of a large arcade of coronal loops that had been present
in an active region for several days. The reconnection excited MHD oscillations
in both magnetic structures simultaneously: period P_1 was generated in the
emerging loop and in a loop being a result of the reconnection; period P_2
occurred in the arcade. Both resonators produced photons of different spectra.
We anticipate that multiperiodicity in hard X-rays can be a common feature of

degree of concurrent bursts in tweets (posts) and retweets (re-posts) works as
a strong indicator of winning or losing a game. More specifically, our simple
tweet analysis of Japanese professional baseball games in 2013 revealed that
social sensors can immediately react to positive and negative events through
bursts of tweets, but that positive events are more likely to induce a
subsequent burst of retweets. We also show that these findings hold true across
cultures by analyzing tweets related to Major League Baseball games in 2015.
Furthermore, we demonstrate active interactions among social sensors by
constructing retweet networks during a baseball game. The resulting networks
commonly exhibited user clusters depending on the baseball team, with a
scale-free connectedness that is indicative of a substantial difference in user
popularity as an information source. While previous studies have mainly focused
on bursts of tweets as a simple indicator of a real-world event, the temporal
correlation between tweets and retweets implies unique aspects of social
sensors, offering new insights into human behavior in a highly connected world.

intervals from 2 days to 3 years, over a wavelength range from 0.85 {\mu}m to

spectra of all targets are variable, and that every emission feature observed
is also variable (although not for all targets). With one exception, there were
no drastic changes in the continua of the spectra, nor did any line completely
disappear, nor did any line appear that was not previously apparent. This
analysis focuses on understanding the connection between accretion (traced by H
Br $\gamma$ and CO) and the wind (traced by He I, [FeII], and sometimes H$_2$).
For both accretion and wind tracers, the median variability was constant versus
time interval between observations, however the maximum variability that we
observed increased with time interval between observations. Extinction is
observed to vary within the minimum sampling time of 2 days, suggesting
extinguishing material within a few stellar radii at high disk latitudes. The
variability of [FeII] and H$_2$ were correlated for most (but not all) of the 7
YSOs showing both features, and the amplitude of the variability depends on the
veiling. Although the occurrence of CO and Br $\gamma$ emission are connected,
their variability is uncorrelated, suggesting that these emissions originate in
separate regions near the protostar (e.g., disk and wind).

experiment never affects its outcome. This is reflected in the Standard Model
of physics by requiring all particles and fields to be invariant under Lorentz
transformations. The most well-known test of this important cornerstone of
physics are Michelson-Morley-type experiments\cite{MM, Herrmann2009,Eisele2009}
verifying the isotropy of the speed of light. Lorentz symmetry also implies
that the kinetic energy of an electron should be independent of the direction
of its velocity, \textit{i.e.,} its dispersion relation should be isotropic in
space. In this work, we search for violation of Lorentz symmetry for electrons
by performing an electronic analogue of a Michelson-Morley experiment. We split
an electron-wavepacket bound inside a calcium ion into two parts with different
orientations and recombine them after a time evolution of 95ms. As the Earth
rotates, the absolute spatial orientation of the wavepackets changes and
anisotropies in the electron dispersion would modify the phase of the
interference signal. To remove noise, we prepare a pair of ions in a
decoherence-free subspace, thereby rejecting magnetic field fluctuations common
to both ions\cite{Roos2006}. After a 23 hour measurement, we limit the energy
variations to $h\times 11$ mHz ($h$ is Planck's constant), verifying that
Lorentz symmetry is preserved at the level of $1\times10^{-18}$. We improve on
the Lorentz-violation limits for the electron by two orders of
magnitude\cite{Hohensee2013c}. We can also interpret our result as testing the
rotational invariance of the Coloumb potential, improving limits on rotational
anisotropies in the speed of light by a factor of
five\cite{Herrmann2009,Eisele2009}. Our experiment demonstrates the potential
of quantum information techniques in the search for physics beyond the Standard

problems. We find that some representative models, such as Robust Principal
Component Analysis (R-PCA), Robust Low Rank Representation (R-LRR), and Robust
Latent Low Rank Representation (R-LatLRR), are actually deeply connected. More
specifically, we discover that once a solution to one of the models is
obtained, we can obtain the solutions to other models in closed-form
formulations. Since R-PCA is the simplest, our discovery makes it the center of
low rank subspace recovery models. Our work has two important implications.
First, R-PCA has a solid theoretical foundation. Under certain conditions, we
could find better solutions to these low rank models at overwhelming
probabilities, although these models are non-convex. Second, we can obtain
significantly faster algorithms for these models by solving R-PCA first. The
computation cost can be further cut by applying low complexity randomized
algorithms, e.g., our novel $\ell_{2,1}$ filtering algorithm, to R-PCA.
Experiments verify the advantages of our algorithms over other state-of-the-art

obtained and presented on the mixing angle and the reactor neutrino spectrum,

5 MeV with respect to the most commonly used models. The excess is found to be
consistent with coming from reactors. We have also successfully measured the

the Yucatan Peninsula were assessed paired sets of 20m multispectral SPOT and
16-day 500m MODIS images. Normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and
enhanced vegetation index (EVI) values were calculated to measure mangrove
canopy reflectance using three methods of analysis- 1) mangrove NDVI sample
point extraction, 2) qualitative assessment of 500m MODIS NDVI and EVI time
series, and 3) transects of NDVI differences before and after storm events.
Results show each method effectively captures changes in mangrove canopies
consistent with storm effects. However, the extent of damage to mangroves in
South Florida and Sian Ka'an was highly variable. Hurricanes Wilma and Katrina
produced a large drop in NDVI although NDVI values recovered within a year,
suggesting remarkable resilience. Hurricane Emily apparently increased mangrove
photosynthetic activity owing to the location of landfall relative to the study
area, the size of the wind field and the apparent lack of storm surge.
Comparison of SPOT NDVI and MODIS NDVI values revealed that the changes pre-
and post-storms were consistent at the different scales of observation.

redshift space distortions (RSD) and baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) use 3D
coordinates, which requires a model dependent conversion of angles and
redshifts into comoving distances. This is the first paper of a series, which
explore modelling multi-tracer galaxy clustering (of WL, BAO and RSD), using
only angular (2D) cross-correlations in thin redshift bins. This involves
evaluating many thousands cross-correlations, each a multidimensional integral,
which is computationally demanding. We present a new algorithm that performs
these calculations as matrix operations.
  Nearby narrow redshift bins are intrinsically correlated, which can be used
to recover the full (radial) 3D information. We show that the Limber
approximation does not work well for this task. In the exact calculation, both
the clustering amplitude and the RSD effect increase when decreasing the
redshift bin width. For narrow bins, the cross-correlations has a larger BAO
peak than the auto-correlation because smaller scales are filtered out by the
radial redshift separation. Moreover, the BAO peak shows a second (ghost) peak,
shifted to smaller angles. We explore how WL, RSD and BAO contribute to the
cross-correlations as a function of the redshift bin width and present a first
exploration of non-linear effects and signal-to-noise ratio on these
quantities. This illustrates that the new approach to clustering analysis
provides new insights and is potentially viable in practice.

  Denoising","6 pages",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We address the problem of image denoising in additive white noise without
placing restrictive assumptions on its statistical distribution. In the recent
literature, specific noise distributions have been considered and
correspondingly, optimal denoising techniques have been developed. One of the
successful approaches for denoising relies on the notion of unbiased risk
estimation, which enables one to obtain a useful substitute for the mean-square
error. For the case of additive white Gaussian noise contamination, the risk
estimation procedure relies on Stein's lemma. Sophisticated wavelet-based
denoising techniques, which are essentially nonlinear, have been developed with
the help of the lemma. We show that, for linear, shift-invariant denoisers, it
is possible to obtain unbiased risk estimates of the mean-square error without
using Stein's lemma. An interesting consequence of this development is that the
unbiased risk estimator becomes agnostic to the statistical distribution of the
noise. As a proof of principle, we show how the new methodology can be used to
optimize the parameters of a simple Gaussian smoother. By locally adapting the
parameters of the Gaussian smoother, we obtain a shift-variant smoother, which
has a denoising performance (quantified by the improvement in peak
signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR)) that is competitive to far more sophisticated
methods reported in the literature. The proposed solution exhibits considerable
parallelism, which we exploit in a Graphics Processing Unit (GPU)
implementation.

contact with a spherical absorber of radius $R$. Employing the macroscopic
fluctuation theory and assuming the additivity principle, we evaluate the
probability distribution ${\mathcal P}(N)$ that $N$ particles are absorbed
during a long time $T$. The limit of $N=0$ corresponds to the survival problem,
whereas $N\gg \bar{N}$ describes the opposite extreme. Here $\bar{N}=4\pi R D_0
n_0 T$ is the \emph{average} number of absorbed particles (in three
dimensions), and $D_0$ is the gas diffusivity. For $n_0\ll 1$ the exclusion
effects are negligible, and ${\mathcal P}(N)$ can be approximated, for not too
large $N$, by the Poisson distribution with mean $\bar{N}$. For finite $n_0$,
${\mathcal P}(N)$ is non-Poissonian. We show that $-\ln{\mathcal P}(N) \simeq

It is an analog of the Sol geometry, namely, it is a horocylic product of the
hyperbolic upper half plane with a ""stretching"" parameter q and the homogeneous
tree T with vertex degree p+1 < 2, the latter seen as a one-complex. In a
previous paper [arXiv:1212.6151, Rev. Mat. Iberoamericana, in print] we have
explored the metric structure and isometry group of that space. Relying on the
analysis on strip complexes, a family of natural Laplacians with ""vertical

considered.
  Here, we undertake a potential theoretic study, investigating the positive
harmonic functions associated with those Laplacians. The methodological
subtleties stem from the singularites of treebolic space at its bifurcation
lines. We first study harmonic functions on simply connected sets with
""rectangular"" shape that are unions of strips. We derive a Poisson
representation and obtain a solution of the Dirichlet problem on sets of that
type. This provides properties of the density of the induced random walk on the
collection of all bifuraction lines. Subsequently, we prove that each positive
harmonic function with respect to that random walk has a unique extension which
is harmonic with respect to the Laplacian on treebolic space. Finally, we
derive a decomposition theorem for positive harmonic functions on the entire
space that leads to a characterisation of the weak Liouville property. We
determine all minimal harmonic functions in those cases where our Laplacian
arises from lifting a (smooth) hyperbolic Laplacian with drift from the
hyperbolic plane to treebolic space.

probabilistic-programming languages, typically consist of two components: a
specification of a stochastic process (the prior), and a specification of
observations that restrict the probability space to a conditional subspace (the
posterior). Use cases of such formalisms include the development of algorithms
in machine learning and artificial intelligence. We propose and investigate a
declarative framework for specifying statistical models on top of a database,
through an appropriate extension of Datalog. By virtue of extending Datalog,
our framework offers a natural integration with the database, and has a robust
declarative semantics. Our Datalog extension provides convenient mechanisms to
include numerical probability functions; in particular, conclusions of rules
may contain values drawn from such functions. The semantics of a program is a
probability distribution over the possible outcomes of the input database with
respect to the program; these outcomes are minimal solutions with respect to a
related program with existentially quantified variables in conclusions.
Observations are naturally incorporated by means of integrity constraints over
the extensional and intensional relations. We focus on programs that use
discrete numerical distributions, but even then the space of possible outcomes
may be uncountable (as a solution can be infinite). We define a probability
measure over possible outcomes by applying the known concept of cylinder sets
to a probabilistic chase procedure. We show that the resulting semantics is
robust under different chases. We also identify conditions guaranteeing that
all possible outcomes are finite (and then the probability space is discrete).
We argue that the framework we propose retains the purely declarative nature of
Datalog, and allows for natural specifications of statistical models.

origin. In this work, a new vibronic Ising-like model in which the elastic

bending (SAB) interactions is proposed and solved by Monte Carlo simulations.
The key parameters in the new model, $k_1$ and $k_2$, corresponding to the

directly related to the macroscopic bulk and shear modulus of the material in
study, which can be readily estimated either based on experimental measurements
or first-principles calculations. The convergence issue in the MC simulations
of the thermal hysteresis has been carefully checked, and it was found that the
stable hysteresis loop can be more readily obtained when using the SAB model
compared to that using the Wajnflasz-Pick model. Using realistic parameters
estimated based on first-principles calculations of a specific polymeric

Lithium using the phenomenon of Optical Pumping. The Li atoms present in the
thin film are optically pumped to one of the ground hyperfine energy levels so
that they can no more absorb light from the resonant light source. Now in
presence of a RF signal, which quantifies the ambient magnetic field, this
polarized atomic system is again randomized thus making it reabsorb the
resonant light. This gives a quantified measurement of the magnetic field
surrounding the thin film detector. This is then mapped to the presence of
magnetic HEM and hence the HEM are detected. Our approach in this regard starts
with verifying the stability of Lithium atoms in various solvents so as to get
a suitable liquid medium to form a thin film. In this regard, various
UV-visible characterization spectra are presented to finally approach a stable
system for the detection. We have worked on around 10 polar and non- polar
solvents to see the stability criteria. UV-Vis probe has been found to be quite
effective in addressing issue of hosting Lithium atoms by various solvents.
Further results on the atomic system size as dispersed in the various solvents
are presented. Atomic system size gives us a good quantitative estimate of the
density of Lithium dispersed system in the thin film. Finally a separate atomic
system under Ultrahigh vacuum is presented to achieve optical pumping wherein
the polarization and depolarization of atomic system is seen using a 670 nm
diode laser system which is electronically locked using a double window Hollow
cathode lamp. These both systems will finally be combined together to give the
final form to the detection system. As this whole system measures relative
change in magnetic field due to the presence of HEM,it gives a more reliable
and accurate detection method compared to the absolute measurement detectors.

recently proposed statistical scaling symmetry is physically void. Although
this scaling is mathematically admitted as a unique symmetry transformation by
the underlying statistical equations for incompressible Navier-Stokes
turbulence on the level of the functional Hopf equation, by closer inspection,
however, it leads to physical inconsistencies and erroneous conclusions in the
theory of turbulence. The new statistical symmetry is thus misleading in so far
as it forms within an unmodelled theory an analytical result which at the same
time lacks physical consistency. Our investigation will expose this
inconsistency on different levels of statistical description, where on each
level we will gain new insights for its non-physical transformation behavior.
With a view to generate invariant turbulent scaling laws, the consequences will
be finally discussed when trying to analytically exploit such a symmetry. In
fact, a mismatch between theory and numerical experiment is conclusively
quantified. We ultimately propose a general strategy on how to not only track
unphysical statistical symmetries, but also on how to avoid generating such
misleading invariance results from the outset. All the more so as this specific
study on a physically inconsistent scaling symmetry only serves as a
representative example within the broader context of statistical invariance
analysis. In this sense our investigation is applicable to all areas of
statistical physics in which symmetries get determined in order to either
characterize complex dynamical systems, or in order to extract physically
useful and meaningful information from the underlying dynamical process itself.

detection, the structure factors are in very good agreement with the
phenomenological Helm form factors used to give experimental limits for
WIMP-nucleon cross sections. In contrast to spin-dependent WIMP scattering, the
spin-independent channel, at the one-body level, is less sensitive to nuclear
structure details. In addition, we explicitly show that the structure factors
for inelastic scattering are suppressed by ~ 10^{-4} compared to the coherent
elastic scattering response. This implies that the detection of inelastic
scattering will be able to discriminate clearly between spin-independent and
spin-dependent scattering. Finally, we provide fits for all calculated
structure factors.

performance comparison of three different classes of on-demand routing
protocols for mobile ad hoc networks: stability-based routing, power-aware
routing and load-balanced routing. We choose the Flow-Oriented Routing protocol
(FORP), Min-Max Battery Cost Routing (MMBCR) and the traffic interference based
Load Balancing Routing (LBR) protocol as representatives of the stability-based
routing, poweraware routing and load-balancing routing protocols respectively.
FORP incurs the least number of route transitions; while LBR incurs the
smallest hop count and lowest end-to-end delay per data packet. Energy consumed
per data packet is the least for LBR, closely followed by MMBCR. FORP incurs
the maximum energy consumed per data packet, both in the absence and presence
of power control. Nevertheless, in the presence of power control, the
end-to-end delay per data packet and energy consumed per data packet incurred
by FORP are significantly reduced compared to the scenario without power
control. MMBCR is the most fair in terms of node usage and incurs the largest
time for first node failure. FORP tends to repeatedly use nodes lying on the
stable path and hence is the most unfair of the three routing protocols. FORP
also incurs the smallest value for the time of first node failure.

functions, together with the light cone (""retardation"") equation of an
inertially moving observer. Then a set of apparent copies, R- or C-particles,
defined by the (real or complex conjugate) roots of the retardation equation
will be detected by the observer. We prove that for any ""polynomial"" worldline
the induced collective dynamics of the system of R-C particles obeys a whole
set of canonical conservation laws (for total momentum, angular momentum and
the analogue of mechanical energy). Explicit formulas for the values of total
angular momentum and the analogue of total rest energy (rest mass) are
obtained; the latter is ""self-quantized"", i.e. for any worldline takes only
integer values. The dynamics is Lorentz invariant though different from the
canonical relativistic mechanics. Asymptotically, at large values of the
observer's proper time, the R-C particles gather themselves into pairs and then
assemble into compact incoming/outgoing clusters. As a whole, the evolution
resembles the process of (either elastic or inelastic) scattering of a beam of
composite particles. Throughout the paper the consideration is purely
algebraic, with no resort to differential equations of motion, field equations,
etc.
