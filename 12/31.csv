a ZnO based bulk planar microcavity and compare experimental results with a
theoretical model for a non-equilibrium condensate. Experimentally, we detect
intensity fluctuations within the far-field emission pattern even at high
condensate densities which indicates a significant impact of disorder. We show
that these effects rely on the driven dissipative nature of the condensate and
argue that they can be accounted for by spatial phase inhomogeneities induced
by disorder, which occur even for increasing condensate densities realized in
the regime of high excitation power. Thus, non-equilibrium effects strongly
suppress the stabilization of the condensate against disorder, contrarily to
what is expected for equilibrium condensates in the high density limit.
Numerical simulations based on our theoretical model reproduce the experimental
data.

likely that quantum computation is intrinsically more powerful than classical
computation. At present, the best upper bound known for the power of quantum
computation is that BQP is in AWPP. This work investigates limits on
computational power that are imposed by physical principles. To this end, we
define a circuit-based model of computation in a class of operationally-defined
theories more general than quantum theory, and ask: what is the minimal set of
physical assumptions under which the above inclusion still holds? We show that
given only an assumption of tomographic locality (roughly, that multipartite
states can be characterised by local measurements), efficient computations are
contained in AWPP. This inclusion still holds even without assuming a basic
notion of causality (where the notion is, roughly, that probabilities for
outcomes cannot depend on future measurement choices). Following Aaronson, we
extend the computational model by allowing post-selection on measurement
outcomes. Aaronson showed that the corresponding quantum complexity class is
equal to PP. Given only the assumption of tomographic locality, the inclusion
in PP still holds for post-selected computation in general theories. Thus in a
world with post-selection, quantum theory is optimal for computation in the
space of all general theories. We then consider if relativised complexity
results can be obtained for general theories. It is not clear how to define a
sensible notion of an oracle in the general framework that reduces to the
standard notion in the quantum case. Nevertheless, it is possible to define
computation relative to a `classical oracle'. Then, we show there exists a
classical oracle relative to which efficient computation in any theory
satisfying the causality assumption and tomographic locality does not include
NP.

These data have enabled a line-by-line analysis of the entire pulsation cycle

factor of at least two at minimum radius, that the phase of radius minimum is a
function of optical depth and the pulse speed through the photosphere is
between 141 and 239 km/s (depending how measured) and at least ten times the

individual line profiles; those formed deepest in the photosphere show a jump

standard tool in computational optics applied to atmospheric sciences,
astrophysics and recently to nano-science under the keyword ""optical tweezers"",
see the survey article [YuHo07] and the literature quoted there. In sharp
contrast to the abundance of articles by physicists describing and analyzing
applications of the VIE method, the mathematical literature on the subject
consists only of a few articles. An early spectral analysis of a VIE for
magnetic problems was given in [FrPa84], and more recently [Ki07, KiLe09] have
found sufficient conditions for well-posedness of the VIE in electromagnetic

investigated the essential spectrum of the VIE in electromagnetic scattering
under general conditions on the complex-valued coefficients, finding necessary
and sufficient conditions for well-posedness in the sense of Fredholm in the
physically relevant energy spaces. A detailed presentation of these results can
be found in the thesis [Sa14]. Publications based on the thesis are in
preparation. Curiously, whereas the study of VIE in electromagnetic scattering
has thus been completed as far as questions of Fredholm properties are

construct a new basis which block-diagonalizes the four-replica mass-matrix,
into the replicon, anomalous and longitudinal modes. The eigenvalues are given
in terms of the mass RFT and the propagators in the RFT space are obtained by
inversion of the block-diagonal matrix. The formalism allows to express any
$i$-replica vertex in the new RFT basis and hence enables to perform a standard
perturbation expansion. We apply the formalism to calculate the contribution of
the Gaussian fluctuations around the Parisi solution for the free-energy of an
Ising spin glass.

has been devoted to the search for new materials and devices that can realize
memory and logic. Spintronics, is one of the promising directions for the
Post-CMOS era. While the potential of spintronic memories is relatively well
known, realizing logic remains an open and critical challenge. All Spin Logic
(ASL) is a recently proposed logic style that realizes Boolean logic using
spin-transfer-torque (STT) devices based on the principle of non-local spin
torque. ASL has advantages such as density, non-volatility, and low operating
voltage. However, it also suffers from drawbacks such as low speed and static
power dissipation. Recent work has shown that, in the context of simple
arithmetic circuits (adders, multipliers), the efficiency of ASL can be greatly
improved using techniques that utilize its unique characteristics. An
evaluation of ASL across a broad range of circuits, considering the known
optimization techniques, is an important next step in determining its
viability. In this work, we propose a systematic methodology for the synthesis
of ASL circuits. Our methodology performs various optimizations that benefit
ASL, such as intra-cycle power gating, stacking of ASL nanomagnets, and
fine-grained logic pipelining. We utilize the proposed methodology to evaluate
the suitability of ASL implementations for a wide range of benchmarks viz.
random combinational and sequential logic, digital signal processing circuits,
and the Leon SPARC3 general-purpose processor. Based on our evaluation, we
identify (i) the large current requirement of nanomagnets at fast switching
speeds, (ii) the static power dissipation in the all-metallic devices, and
(iii) the short spin flip length in interconnects as key bottlenecks that limit
the competitiveness of ASL.

This implies an optimal number of rules that avoids these two extremes. Rules
create boundaries that define the latitude an individual has to perform their
activities. This paper creates a Toy Model of a work environment and examines
it with respect to the latitude provided to a normal individual and the
latitude provided to an insider threat. Simulations with the Toy Model
illustrate four regimes with respect to an insider threat: under-regulated,
possibly optimal, tipping-point, and over-regulated. These regimes depend up
the number of rules (N) and the minimum latitude (Lmin) required by a normal
individual to carry out their activities. The Toy Model is then mapped onto the
standard 1D Percolation Model from theoretical physics and the same behavior is
observed. This allows the Toy Model to be generalized to a wide array of more
complex models that have been well studied by the theoretical physics community
and also show the same behavior. Finally, by estimating N and Lmin it should be
possible to determine the regime of any particular environment.

improvement. In this paper, we investigate how much of the potential doubling
can be practically achieved in the resource-managed, small multi-cellular

focus on low-powered small cellular systems, because they are more suitable for
FD operation given practical self-interference cancellation limits. A joint UE
selection and power allocation method for a multi-cell scenario is presented,
where a hybrid scheduling policy assigns FD timeslots when it provides a
throughput advantage by pairing UEs with appropriate power levels to mitigate
the mutual interference, but otherwise defaults to HD operation. Due to the
complexity of finding the globally optimum solution of the proposed algorithm,
a sub-optimal method based on a heuristic greedy algorithm for UE selection,
and a novel solution using geometric programming for power allocation, is
proposed. With practical self-interference cancellation, antennas and circuits,
it is shown that the proposed hybrid FD system achieves as much as 94%

localize gravity as well as scalar and gauge vector fields in a tachyonic de
Sitter thick braneworld, we investigate the localization of fermion fields in
this model. In order to achieve this aim we consider the Yukawa interaction
term between the fermions and the tachyonic condensate scalar field
MF(T)barPsiPsi in the action and analyze four different cases corresponding to
distinct tachyonic functions F(T(w)). The only condition that this function
must satisfy in order to yield 4D chiral fermions upon dimensional reduction is
to be odd in the extra dimension w. These functions lead to a different
structure of the respective fermionic mass spectrum. In particular,
localization of the massless left-chiral fermion zero mode is possible for
three of these cases. We further analyze the phenomenology of the Yukawa
interaction among fermion fields and gauge bosons localized on the brane and
obtain the crucial and necessary information to compute the corrections to
Coulomb's law coming from massive KK vector modes in the non-relativistic
limit. These corrections are exponentially suppressed due to the presence of
the mass gap in the mass spectrum of the bulk gauge vector field. From our
results we conclude that corrections to Coulomb's law in the thin brane limit
have the same form (up to a numerical factor) as far as the left-chiral
massless fermion field is localized on the brane. Finally we compute the
corrections to the Coulomb's law for a more general case, on a thick brane
scenario, for which we can do estimates consistent with brane phenomenology,
i.e. we found that the predicted corrections to the Coulomb law in our model,
which are well bounded by the observed experimental photon mass, is far beyond
its upper bound, positively testing the viability of our tachyonic braneworld.

$SU(3)_c \times SU(2)_L \times SU(2)_R \times U(1)_{B-L}$. A variety of
symmetry breaking sectors are studied, with a focus on the constraints placed
on model parameters by the lightest neutral CP even Higgs boson mass $M_h$. The
breaking of $SU(2)_R$ symmetry is achieved by Higgs fields transforming either
as triplets or doublets, and the electroweak symmetry breaking is triggered by
either bi--doublets or doublets. The Higgs potential is analyzed with or
without a gauge singlet Higgs field present. Seesaw models of Type I and Type
II, inverse seesaw models, universal seesaw models and an $E_6$ inspired
alternate left--right model are included in our analysis. Several of these
models lead to the tree--level relation $M_h \leq \sqrt{2}\,m_W$ (rather than
$M_h \leq m_Z$ that arises in the MSSM), realized when the $SU(2)_R$ symmetry
breaking scale is of order TeV. With such an enhanced upper limit, it becomes
possible to accommodate a Higgs boson of mass 126 GeV with relatively light
stops that mix negligibly. In models with Higgs triplets, a doubly charged
scalar remains light below a TeV with its mass arising entirely from radiative
corrections. We carry out the complete one--loop calculation for its mass
induced by the Majorana Yukawa couplings and show the consistency of the
framework. We argue that these models prefer a low $SU(2)_R$ breaking scale.
Other theoretical and phenomenological implications of these models are briefly
discussed.

can grow exponentially fast with the sample size $n$. Our method combines the
de-biasing technique with the composite quantile function to construct an
estimator that is asymptotically normal. Hence it can be used to construct
valid confidence intervals and conduct hypothesis tests. Our estimator is
robust and does not require the existence of first or second moment of the
noise distribution. It also preserves efficiency in the sense that the worst
case efficiency loss is less than 30\% compared to the square-loss-based
de-biased Lasso estimator. In many cases our estimator is close to or better
than the latter, especially when the noise is heavy-tailed. Our de-biasing
procedure does not require solving the $L_1$-penalized composite quantile
regression. Instead, it allows for any first-stage estimator with desired
convergence rate and empirical sparsity. The paper also provides new proof
techniques for developing theoretical guarantees of inferential procedures with
non-smooth loss functions. To establish the main results, we exploit the local
curvature of the conditional expectation of composite quantile loss and apply
empirical process theories to control the difference between empirical
quantities and their conditional expectations. Our results are established
under weaker assumptions compared to existing work on inference for
high-dimensional quantile regression. Furthermore, we consider a
high-dimensional simultaneous test for the regression parameters by applying
the Gaussian approximation and multiplier bootstrap theories. We also study
distributed learning and exploit the divide-and-conquer estimator to reduce
computation complexity when the sample size is massive. Finally, we provide
empirical results to verify the theory.

exchange with the help of four fundamental operators: cash and share operators;
a portfolio operator and an operator reflecting the loss of information. An
information Hamiltonian is considered and an additional Hamiltonian is
presented which reflects the dynamics of selling/buying shares between traders.
An important result of the paper is that when the information Hamiltonian is
zero, portfolio operators commute with the Hamiltonian and this suggests that
the dynamics are really due to the information. Under the assumption that the
interaction and information terms in the Hamiltonian have similar strength, a
perturbation scheme is considered on the interaction parameter. Contrary to
intuition, the paper shows that up to a second order in the interaction
parameter, a key factor in the computation of the portfolios of traders will be
the initial values of the loss of information (rather than the initial
conditions on the cash and shares). Finally, the paper shows that a natural
outcome from the inequality of the variation of the portfolio of trader one
versus the variation of the portfolio of trader two, begs for the introduction
of `good' and `bad' information. It is shown that `good' information is related

This simple model can provide a strong enough first order phase transition,
which is required in order to account for the matter-antimatter asymmetry in
the Universe (BAU). However, another necessary ingredient is missing, as there
is no additional source of CP violation in the IDM, besides the standard CKM
phase from the Standard Model. Additional CP violating phase can appear if a
complex singlet of $SU(3)_C \times SU(2)_W \times U(1)_Y$ with a non-zero
vacuum expectation value is added to the scalar sector of the IDM. We construct
the scalar potential of the inert doublet plus singlet model (IDMS), assuming
an exact $Z_2$ symmetry, with singlet being $Z_2$-even. To simplify the model
we use a softly broken $U(1)$ symmetry, which allows a reduction of the number
of free parameters in the potential. We study the masses and interactions of
scalar particles for a few benchmark scenarios. Constraints from collider
physics, in particular from the Higgs signal observed at LHC with $M_h\approx
125$ GeV are discussed, as well as constraints from the dark matter
experiments.

linear combinations thereof, can be matched to obstructions in the pupils of
ground-based telescopes to improve the contrast achieved by a vortex
coronagraph. This approach works well in the presence of a central obscuration
and radial support structures. We analyze the contrast, off-axis throughput,

Every round, each player observes a subset of components of a random vector and
then takes a control action. The utility earned by each player depends on the
full random vector and on the actions of others. An example is a game where
different rewards are placed over multiple locations, each player only knows
the rewards in a subset of the locations, and players compete to collect the
rewards. Sharing information can help others, but can also increase competition
for desirable locations. Standard Nash equilibrium and correlated equilibrium
concepts are inadequate in this scenario. Instead, this paper develops an
algorithm where, every round, all players pass their information and intended
actions to a game manager. The manager provides suggested actions for each
player that, if taken, maximize a concave function of average utilities subject
to the constraint that each player gets an average utility no worse than it
would get without sharing. The algorithm acts online using information given at
each round and does not require a specific model of random events or player
actions. Thus, the analytical results of this paper apply in non-ergodic
situations with any sequence of actions taken by human players.

aggregates with intra-coupling in donors and acceptor chromophores. Enhanced
rates in multichromophoric resonance energy transfer are shown to be well
described by this theory. Specifically, in a coupling configuration between

predicts an enhancement of the energy transfer rate dependent on the total

Finally, it is explicitly shown that as long as linear response theory holds,

involves mass transport mediated by native point defects. We also discuss how
Ti and Ni impurities alter the Fermi-level position with respect to that in the
undoped material, thus changing the concentration of charged defects that are
responsible for mass transport. This mechanism provides an explanation for the
experimentally observed lowering of the temperature for the onset of
decomposition and of the activation energy for hydrogen desorption from
LiAlH$_{4}$.

theory of differential equations rooted in the XIX century. Although it saw
many significant advances in analyzing certain classes of equations, the
classification still remains an open problem especially for the higher-order
equations. One of the main classical methods of Painlev\'e analysis is based on
considering the resonance numbers corresponding to the possible indices of
arbitrary coefficients in the Laurent expansion of the general solution in a
neighborhood of a movable singularity. Complex and non-integer values of
resonance numbers point out to existence of the movable critical singularities
and positive integer numbers could be used to construct the said general
solution. Also the equation always possesses at least one negative resonance
number of $-1$ which corresponds to an arbitrary position of a movable pole.
However our understanding of the role of nontrivial negative resonances
different from $-1$ remains limited in spite of certain recent methodological
advances related to it. And though in the lower-order classifications built so
far such equations with nontrivial negative resonances have rather been a
special case, the result of present work demonstrates that negative resonances
are in fact common for the higher degree ordinary differential equations with
Painlev\'e property. Specifically we'll prove that their presence is the
necessary condition of the Painlev\'e property for the equations with degree of

stationary properties of physical systems, especially in situations where
direct sampling is unfeasible. Common implementations of Monte Carlo algorithms
employ reversible Markov chains. Reversible chains obey detailed balance and
thus ensure that the system will eventually relax to equilibrium. Detailed
balance is not necessary for convergence to equilibrium. We review
nonreversible Markov chains, which violate detailed balance, and yet still
relax to a given target stationary distribution. In particular cases,
nonreversible Markov chains are substantially better at sampling than the
conventional reversible Markov chains with up to a square root improvement in
the convergence time to the steady state. One kind of nonreversible Markov
chain is constructed from the reversible ones by enlarging the state space and
by modifying and adding extra transition rates to create non-reversible moves.
Because of the augmentation of the state space, such chains are often referred
to as lifted Markov Chains. We illustrate the use of lifted Markov chains for
efficient sampling for several examples. The examples include sampling on a
ring, sampling on a torus, the Ising model on a complete graph, and the
one-dimensional Ising model. We also provide a pseudocode implementation,

any computation on the plaintext can be performed by a party having access to

homomorphic encryption, which is the encryption of quantum information such
that quantum computations can be performed given the ciphertext only. Our
schemes allows for arbitrary Clifford group gates, but become inefficient for
circuits with large complexity, measured in terms of the non-Clifford portion
of the circuit (we use the ""$\pi/8$"" non-Clifford group gate, which is also
known as the $T$-gate).
  More specifically, two schemes are proposed: the first scheme has a
decryption procedure whose complexity scales with the square of the number of
$T$-gates (compared with a trivial scheme in which the complexity scales with
the total number of gates); the second scheme uses a quantum evaluation key of
length given by a polynomial of degree exponential in the circuit's $T$-gate
depth, yielding a homomorphic scheme for quantum circuits with constant
$T$-depth. Both schemes build on a classical fully homomorphic encryption
scheme.

encryption schemes for quantum messages: we define quantum indistinguishability
under chosen plaintext attacks in both the public and private-key settings. In
this context, we show the equivalence of several definitions.
  Our schemes are the first of their kind that are secure under modern

proper motions from the combination of Gaia data with Hipparcos prior

  Aims. We study the potential of using the positions from the Tycho-2
Catalogue as additional information for a joint solution with early Gaia data.
We call this the Tycho-Gaia astrometric solution (TGAS).
  Methods. We adapt Gaia's Astrometric Global Iterative Solution (AGIS) to
incorporate Tycho information, and use simulated Gaia observations to
demonstrate the feasibility of TGAS and to estimate its performance.
  Results. Using six to twelve months of Gaia data, TGAS could deliver
positions, parallaxes and annual proper motions for the 2.5 million Tycho-2
stars, with sub-milliarcsecond accuracy. TGAS overcomes some of the limitations
of the HTPM project and allows its execution half a year earlier. Furthermore,

different regions in physical space for the dual CFT. This, however, is just
one of many ways to split a given system into subsectors, and extremal surfaces
in the internal space should similarly quantify entanglement between subsectors
of the theory. For the case of AdS$_5\times$S$^5$, their area was interpreted
as entanglement entropy between U(n) and U(m) subsectors of U(n+m) N=4 SYM.
Making this proposal precise is subtle for a number of reasons, the most
obvious being that from the bulk one usually has access to gauge-invariant
quantities only, while a split into subgroups is inherently gauge variant. We
study N=4 SYM on the Coulomb branch, where some of the issues can be mitigated
and the proposal can be sharpened. Continuing back to the original
AdS$_5\times$S$^5$ geometry, we obtain a modified proposal, based on the

stripped. In most simulations, a portion of the stripped gas forms a warm dense
gas ring in the S0 galaxy, with a radius of ~6-13 kpc and a mass of ~10^7 solar
masses (Msun). The ring is generally short-lived (<~3 Gyr) if it forms from
prograde encounters, while it can live for more than 6 Gyr if it is born from
counter-rotating or non-coplanar interactions. The gas ring keeps memory of the
initial orbit of the satellite galaxy: it is corotating (counter-rotating) with
the stars of the disc of the S0 galaxy, if it originates from prograde
(retrograde) satellite orbits. Furthermore, the ring is coplanar with the disc
of the S0 galaxy only if the satellite's orbit was coplanar, while it lies on a
plane that is inclined with respect to the disc of the S0 galaxy by the same
inclination angle as the orbital plane of the satellite galaxy. The fact that

Nevertheless, even a small fraction of ultra-strongly self-interacting dark

seed black holes in the center of a halo. These seed black holes, which form

of the skullcap (calvaria) of 13 diverse skulls in the genus Homo, ranging from
Homo erectus (ergaster) at about 1.6 mya, all the way forward to modern humans,
yields a remarkably clear phylogenetic tree. Various evolutionary hypotheses
are tested. Results of these tests include rejection of the monophyly of Homo
heidelbergensis, the Multi-Regional hypothesis, and the hypothesis that the
unusual 12,000 year old (12kya) Iwo Eleru skull represents a modern human.
Rather, by quantitative phylogenetic analyses the latter is seen to be an old
(200-400kya) lineage that probably represents a novel African species, Homo
iwoelerueensis. It diverged after the lineage leading to Neanderthals, and may
have been driven to extinction in the last 10kya by modern humans, Homo
sapiens, another African species of Homo that appeared about 100kya. Another
enigmatic skull, Qafzeh 6 from the Middle East about 90kya, appears to be a
hybrid of two thirds near, but not, anatomically modern human and one third of
an archaic lineage diverging close to classic European Neanderthals. Overall,
the tree clearly implies an accelerating rate of skullcap shape change, and by
extension, change of the underlying brain, over the last 400kya in Africa. This
acceleration may have extended right up to the origin of modern humans. Methods
of distance-based evolutionary tree inference are refined and extended, with
particular attention to diagnosing the model and achieving a better fit. This

his Jesuit peripatetic education, Church doctrine and the lack of crucial
experimental evidence for the motion of the Earth. I present the development of
Boscovich's ideas prior to the lifting of the ban, and his retrospective
considerations in later writings. These show that Boscovich's acceptance of the
motion of the Earth was primarily driven by the existence of a working physical
theory that also explained the motion of the Earth, and the lack of a
consistent theory that supported any variation of a geocentric system.

  Reconstruction in Ultrasound Computed Tomography",,,,,"physics.med-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Ultrasound computed tomography (USCT) holds great promise for improving the
detection and management of breast cancer. Because they are based on the
acoustic wave equation, waveform inversion-based reconstruction methods can
produce images that possess improved spatial resolution properties over those
produced by ray-based methods. However, waveform inversion methods are
computationally demanding and have not been applied widely in USCT breast
imaging. In this work, source encoding concepts are employed to develop an
accelerated USCT reconstruction method that circumvents the large computational
burden of conventional waveform inversion methods. This method, referred to as
the waveform inversion with source encoding (WISE) method, encodes the
measurement data using a random encoding vector and determines an estimate of
the sound speed distribution by solving a stochastic optimization problem by
use of a stochastic gradient descent algorithm. Both computer-simulation and
experimental phantom studies are conducted to demonstrate the use of the WISE
method. The results suggest that the WISE method maintains the high spatial
resolution of waveform inversion methods while significantly reducing the
computational burden.

phenomenological models and on how they are built to include the specificity of
the interactions of RNA bases, whose role is critical in folding. Through
examples from different models, we will point out the strengths of
physics-based approaches, which are able not only to predict equilibrium

the open challenges to include more key interactions ruling RNA folding.

Previous studies have detected the potential of geothermal system and also the
groundwater mechanism feeding the system. This paper will discuss the
geothermal exploration based on regional scale surface temperature analysis
with Landsat image to have a more detail interpretation of the geological
setting and magneto-telluric or MT survey at prospect zones, which identified
by the previous method, to have a more exact and in depth local scale
structural interpretation. Both methods are directed to pin point appropriate
locations for geothermal pilot hole drilling and testing.
  We used four scenes of Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper or ETM+ data to
estimate the surface manifestation of a geothermal system. Temporal analysis of
Land Surface Temperature or LST was applied and coupled with field temperature
measurement at seven locations. By combining the TTM with NDVI threshold, the
authors can identify six zones with surface temperature anomaly. Among these
six zones, three zones were interpreted to have a relation with geothermal
system and the other three zones were related to human activities. Then, MT
survey was performed at the three geothermal prospects identified from previous
remote sensing analysis, at the east flank of the volcano, to estimate the
detail subsurface structures. The MT survey successfully identified four buried
normal faults in the area, which positively are a part of the conduits in the
geothermal system east of Mount Ciremai. From MT analysis, the author also
found the locations of volcanic zone, bedrock zone, and the prospect zone. The
combination of Landsat analysis on regional scale and MT measurement on a more

such queries are based on an underlying (but unknown) class concept, which we

The objective is to maximize the model likelihood given the constraints, and in
the meantime enforce cluster separation and cluster balance by also making use
of the unlabeled instances. We evaluated the proposed method using constraints
generated from ground-truth class labels, and from (noisy) human judgments from
a user study. Experimental results demonstrate: 1) the usefulness of relative
constraints, in particular when don't know answers are considered; 2) the
improved performance of the proposed method over state-of-the-art methods that
utilize either relative or pairwise constraints; and 3) the robustness of our

financial-asset correlation networks. We first argue that the use of the
""modularity"" quality function---which is defined by comparing edge weights in
an observed network to expected edge weights in a ""null network""---is
application-dependent. We differentiate between ""null networks"" and ""null

a multilayer modularity-maximization problem to identify communities in
temporal networks. Our multilayer analysis only depends on the form of the
maximization problem and not on the specific quality function that one chooses.
We introduce a diagnostic to measure \emph{persistence} of community structure
in a multilayer network partition. We prove several results that describe how
the multilayer maximization problem measures a trade-off between static
community structure within layers and larger values of persistence across
layers. We also discuss some computational issues that the popular ""Louvain""

specific density-pressure relation (its `Equation of state', EOS). This
generates a unique mass-radius relation which predicts a characteristic radius

holes. It also uniquely predicts other bulk quantities, like maximum spin
frequency and moment of inertia. The SKA, in Phase 1 and particularly in Phase
2 will, thanks to the exquisite timing precision enabled by its raw
sensitivity, and surveys that dramatically increase the number of sources: 1)
Provide many more precise NS mass measurements (high mass NS measurements are
particularly important for ruling out EOS models); 2) Allow the measurement of
the NS moment of inertia in highly relativistic binaries such as the Double

that do not have very well defined observational criteria. Radio phoenixes are
aged radio galaxy lobes whose emission is reactivated by compression or other
mechanisms. Here, we present the detection of a radio phoenix close to the
moment of its formation. The source is located in Abell 1033, a peculiar galaxy
cluster which underwent a recent merger. To support our claim, we present
unpublished Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope and Chandra observations
together with archival data from the Very Large Array and the Sloan Digital Sky
Survey. We discover the presence of two sub-clusters displaced along the N-S
direction. The two sub-clusters probably underwent a recent merger which is the
cause of a moderately perturbed X-ray brightness distribution. A steep-spectrum
extended radio source very close to an AGN is proposed to be a newly born radio
phoenix: the AGN lobes have been displaced/compressed by shocks formed during
the merger event. This scenario explains the source location, morphology,
spectral index, and brightness. Finally, we show evidence of a density
discontinuity close to the radio phoenix and discuss the consequences of its
presence.

blur in a coded imaging system. The measurements consist of subsampled
convolution of an unknown blurring kernel with multiple random binary
modulations (coded masks) of the image. To perform the deconvolution, we
consider a standard lifting of the image and the blurring kernel that
transforms the measurements into a set of linear equations of the matrix formed
by their outer product. Any rank-one solution to this system of equation
provides a valid pair of an image and a blur.
  We first express the necessary and sufficient conditions for the uniqueness
of a rank-one solution under some additional assumptions (uniform subsampling
and no limit on the number of coded masks). These conditions are special case
of a previously established result regarding identifiability in the matrix
completion problem. We also characterize a low-dimensional subspace model for
the blur kernel that is sufficient to guarantee identifiability, including the
interesting instance of ""bandpass""` blur kernels.
  Next, assuming the bandpass model for the blur kernel, we show that the image
and the blur kernel can be found using nuclear norm minimization. Our main
results show that recovery is achieved (with high probability) when the number
of masks is on the order of
$\mu\log^{2}L\,\log\frac{Le}{\mu}\,\log\log\left(N+1\right)$ where $\mu$ is the
\emph{coherence} of the blur, $L$ is the dimension of the image, and $N$ is the

financial industry operates some of the largest datacenters in the world. With
increasing energy costs and the financial services sector growth, emerging
financial analytics workloads may incur extremely high operational costs, to
meet their latency targets. Microservers have recently emerged as an
alternative to high-end servers, promising scalable performance and low energy
consumption in datacenters via scale-out. Unfortunately, stark differences in
architectural features, form factor and design considerations make a fair
comparison between servers and microservers exceptionally challenging. In this
paper we present a rigorous methodology and new metrics for fair comparison of
server and microserver platforms. We deploy our methodology and metrics to
compare a microserver with ARM cores against two servers with x86 cores,
running the same real-time financial analytics workload. We define
workload-specific but platform-independent performance metrics for platform
comparison, targeting both datacenter operators and end users. Our methodology
establishes that a server based the Xeon Phi processor delivers the highest
performance and energy-efficiency. However, by scaling out energy-efficient
microservers, we achieve competitive or better energy-efficiency than a
power-equivalent server with two Sandy Bridge sockets despite the microserver's
slower cores. Using a new iso-QoS (iso-Quality of Service) metric, we find that
the ARM microserver scales enough to meet market throughput demand, i.e. a 100%
QoS in terms of timely option pricing, with as little as 55% of the energy
consumed by the Sandy Bridge server.

generally achieve this goal by solving complex optimization problems, which
usually demands high computational cost and hence are not feasible for high

model selection in high dimensional QR. We first consider two-stage
regularization methods and establish theoretical properties of the two-stage
LASSO. Then, a new regularization method, called Regularization Algorithm under

regularization solution path efficiently. Both methods are further extended to
solve generalized QR models. Numerical results are also shown to demonstrate

detection of gravitational waves in a pulsar timing array). Using SKA1-MID and
SKA1-LOW we will survey the Milky Way to unprecedented depth, increasing the
number of known pulsars by more than an order of magnitude. SKA2 will
potentially find all the Galactic radio-emitting pulsars in the SKA sky which
are beamed in our direction. This will give a clear picture of the birth
properties of pulsars and of the gravitational potential, magnetic field

pulsars as soon as they are discovered, while simultaneously continuing survey

Using in silico experiments, we study the interplay between collective

tumour spheroids that contain two non-proliferating cell populations of
different motile properties, we explore the conditions required for maximal
invasion into surrounding tissues. We show emerging spatial patterns of
cellular organisation and invasion which are consistent with in vitro and in
vivo observations. This demonstrates that mechanical interactions at the
cellular level are sufficient to account for many of the observed morphologies
of invasion and that heterogeneity in cell motility can be more important than
average mechanical properties in controlling the fate of large cell

Accepted for publication in MNRAS",,"10.1093/mnras/stu2765",,"astro-ph.HE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Frequency dependence of pulsar linear polarization is investigated by
simulations of emission and propagation processes. Linearly polarized waves are
generated through curvature radiation by relativistic particles streaming along
curved magnetic field lines, which have ordinary mode (O-mode) and
extra-ordinary mode (X-mode) components. As emitted waves propagate outwards,
two mode components are separated due to re- fraction of the O mode, and their
polarization states are also modified. According to the radius to frequency
mapping, low frequency emission is generated from higher magnetosphere, where
significant rotation effect leads the X and O modes to be sepa- rated. Hence,
the low frequency radiation has a large fraction of linear polarization. As the
frequency increases, emission is generated from lower heights, where the
rotation effect becomes weaker and the distribution regions of two modes are
more overlapped. Hence, more significant depolarization appears for emission at
higher frequencies. In addition, refraction effect of the O mode becomes
serious in very deep magnetosphere, which bends the O mode emission towards
outer parts of a pulsar beam and also causes the separation of mode
distribution regions and hence the fractional linear polariza- tion increasing
with frequency. If emission of different frequencies is generated from a region
of the same height, serious O mode refraction can result in the decrease of
both profile width and fractional linear polarization. The observed frequency
dependence of linear polarization for some pulsars can be naturally explained
within the scope of our scenario.

data. Many graph partition algorithms have been proposed to solve the problem
in various applications, such as matrix computations and PageRank, etc., but
none has pay attention to random walks. Random walks is a widely used method to
explore graph structure in lots of fields. The challenges of graph partition
for random walks include the large number of times of communication between
partitions, lots of replications of the vertices, unbalanced partition, etc. In
this paper, we propose a feasible graph partition framework for random walks
implemented by parallel computing in big graph. The framework is based on two
optimization functions to reduce the bandwidth, memory and storage cost in the
condition that the load balance is guaranteed. In this framework, several
greedy graph partition algorithms are proposed. We also propose five metrics
from different perspectives to evaluate the performance of these algorithms. By
running the algorithms on the big graph data set of real world, the
experimental results show that these algorithms in the framework are capable of
solving the problem of graph partition for random walks for different needs,
e.g. the best result is improved more than 70 times in reducing the times of

scheme based on co-channel reverse time-division duplex (TDD) and dynamic soft
frequency reuse (SFR) is proposed for interference management in two-tier
HetNets with large-scale antenna arrays at the macro BS and wireless
backhauling for small cells. Two in-band WBBA scenarios, namely, unified
bandwidth allocation and per-small-cell bandwidth allocation scenarios, are
investigated for joint CA-WBBA in the HetNet. A two-level hierarchical
decomposition method for relaxed optimization is employed to solve the
mixed-integer nonlinear program (MINLP). Solutions based on the General
Algorithm Modeling System (GAMS) optimization solver and fast heuristics are
also proposed for cell association in the per-small-cell WBBA scenario. It is
shown that when all small cells have to use in-band wireless backhaul, the
system load has more impact on both the sum log-rate and per-user rate
performance than the number of small cells deployed within the macro cell
range. The proposed joint CA-WBBA algorithms have an optimal load approximately
equal to the size of the large-scale antenna array at the macro BS. The cell
range expansion (CRE) strategy, which is an efficient cell association scheme
for HetNets with perfect backhauling, is shown to be inefficient when in-band
wireless backhauling for small cells comes into play.

the drift velocity of the magnetic-field lines with respect to the gas. We find
that the magnetic flux dissipates in the density range $10^{12}{\rm cm^{-3}}

dissipation density range becomes narrower for lower metallicity. The magnetic
field is always frozen to the gas below metallicity $\lesssim
10^{-7}-10^{-6}Z_\odot$, depending on the ionization rate by cosmic rays and/or
radioactivity. With the same metallicity, the dissipation density range becomes
wider for lower ionization rate. The presence of such a dissipative regime is
expected to cause various dynamical phenomena in protostellar evolution such as
the suppression of jet/outflow launching and fragmentation of the circumstellar

Meanwhile, we also find 6 typical variations of high-ionization and
low-ionization BALs in this BAL quasar sample. Photoionization models suggest
that OFeLoBALs are formed in a relative dense ($n_e>10^6$ cm$^{-3}$) outflows
at a distance from the subparsec to the dozens of parsecs from the continuum
source. They differ from those of non-OFeLoBALs, which are likely produced by
low-density gas, locating at a distance of hundreds to thousands parsecs. Thus,
OFeLoBALs and non-OFeLoBALs, i.e., FeLoBALs with/without strong BAL variations,
perhaps represent the bimodality of Fe II absorption, the former is located in
the active galactic nucleus environment rather than the host galaxy. We suggest
that high density and small distance are the necessary conditions that cause
OFeLoBALs. As suggested in the literature, strong BAL variability is possibly
due to variability of the covering factor of BAL regions caused by clouds
transiting across the line of sight rather than ionization variations.

The magnetic long-range ordering in the parent compound at $T_{\rm N}\simeq$
3.9~K was detected from the drastic line broadening and a peak in the
spin-lattice relaxation rate ($1/T_1$). The NMR spectrum above $T_{\rm N}$
broadens systematically, and its full width at half maximum (FWHM) tracks the
static spin susceptibility. From the analysis of FWHM vs. static
susceptibility, the coupling between the Li nuclei and Cu$^{2+}$ ions was found
to be purely dipolar in nature. The magnitude of the maximum exchange coupling
constant is $J_{\rm max}/k_{\rm B}\simeq 13$\,K. NMR spectra below $T_{\rm N}$
broaden abruptly and transform into a double-horn pattern reflecting the
commensurate nature of the spin structure in the ordered state. Below $T_{\rm
N}$, 1/$T_1$ follows a $T^5$ behavior. The frustrated nature of the compound is
confirmed by persistent magnetic correlations at high temperatures well above
$T_{\rm N}$. The dilution of the spin lattice with non-magnetic Zn atoms has
dramatic influence on $T_N$ that decreases exponentially similar to
quasi-one-dimensional antiferromagnets, even though Li$_2$CuW$_2$O$_8$ has only
a weak one-dimensional anisotropy. Heat capacity of doped samples follows power
law ($C_{\rm p} \propto T^{\alpha}$) below $T_{\rm N}$, and the exponent

results achieved using methods of integrability. For the larger portion of the
thesis we study the N=4 super Yang-Mills theory in the planar limit, a
recurring topic being the Konishi anomalous dimension, which is roughly the
analogue for the mass of the proton in quantum chromodynamics. The N=4
supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory is known to be integrable in the planar limit,
which opens up a wealth of techniques one can employ in order to find results
in this limit valid at any value of the coupling. We begin with perturbation
theory where the integrability of the theory first manifests itself. Here we
showcase the first exact result, the so-called slope function, which is the
linear small spin expansion coefficient of the generalized Konishi anomalous
dimension. We then move on to exact results mainly achieved using the novel
quantum spectral curve approach, the method allowing one to find scaling
dimensions of operators at arbitrary values of the coupling. As an example we
find the second coefficient in the small spin expansion after the slope, which
we call the curvature function. This allows us to extract non-trivial
information about the Konishi operator. Methods of integrability are also
applicable to other supersymmetric gauge theories such as ABJM, which in fact
shares many similarities with N=4 super Yang-Mills. We briefly review these
parallel developments in the last chapter of the thesis.

pure vacuum, which leads us to reconsider the problem for the more physical

infinite acceleration times, but an effective thermal statistics can be
recovered provided that one restricts to the expectation values of smeared

decompose the phase space into a set of metastable states. Unfortunately, the
metastable state decomposition based on simulation or experimental data is
still a challenge. The most popular and simplest approach is geometric
clustering which is developed based on the classical clustering technique.
However, the prerequisites of this approach are: (1) data are obtained from
simulations or experiments which are in global equilibrium and (2) the
coordinate system is appropriately selected. Recently, the kinetic clustering
approach based on phase space discretization and transition probability
estimation has drawn much attention due to its applicability to more general
cases, but the choice of discretization policy is a difficult task. In this
paper, a new decomposition method designated as maximum margin metastable
clustering is proposed, which converts the problem of metastable state
decomposition to a semi-supervised learning problem so that the large margin
technique can be utilized to search for the optimal decomposition without phase
space discretization. Moreover, several simulation examples are given to
illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

importance for efficient density modulation in high-gain seeded free-electron

in the high-gain harmonic generation (HGHG), echo-enabled harmonic generation
(EEHG) and phase-merging enhanced harmonic generation (PEHG) schemes on the
electron energy spread distribution are studied. Theoretical investigations and
multi-dimensional numerical simulations are applied to the cases of uniform and

distributions significantly enhance the performance of HGHG-FELs, while they
almost have no influence on EEHG and PEHG schemes. A numerical example
demonstrates that, with about 84keV RMS uniform and/or saddle slice energy

could process information using quantum states is due to the decoherence of
local excitations about a ground state. A solution to this problem was
suggested in \cite{Kitaev}, relying on (non-local) topological excitations,
structurally protected against local noise. However, a practical implementation
of this proposal using special Landau levels in fractional quantum Hall effect
systems (FQHE) \cite{QHE} has proven elusive, while accessible FQHE states are
theoretically not optimal because their representations in the Hilbert space of

atoms), whose semiclassical dynamics is described by a hyperelliptic function
in the Sklyanin formalism. The homological structure of the complex curve
corresponds to representations of the braid group, with the action of Hecke
operators leading to singularities detectable in the semiclassical
oscillations. We argue that, for a fixed genus of the hyperelliptic curve, the
Richardson-Gaudin pairing Hamiltonian problem is the singular limit $m \to
\infty$ of level-$k$ $\widehat{sl}(2)$, with $k+2 = \frac{4}{8m+1}\to 0$, so
that the level $k$ is admissible in the sense of Kac and Kazhdan \cite{KK}, but

with fixed $q = e^{i\pi/4}$, as $m \to \infty$.

gluons cannot be observed as free particles, but only their bound states, the
hadrons. This so-called confinement phenomenon is responsible for $98\%$ of the
mass in the visible universe. The measurement of the hadron excitation spectra
therefore gives valuable input for theory and phenomenology to quantitatively
understand this phenomenon. One simple model to describe hadrons is the
Constituent Quark Model (CQM), which knows two types of hadrons: mesons,
consisting of a quark and an antiquark, and baryons, which are made out of
three quarks. More advanced models, which are inspired by QCD as well as
calculations within Lattice QCD predict the existence of other types of
hadrons, which may be e.g. described solely by gluonic excitations (glueballs)
or mixed quark and gluon excitations (hybrids). In order to search for such
states, the COMPASS experiment at the Super Proton Synchrotron at CERN has
collected large data sets, which allow to study the light-quark meson and
baryon spectra in unmatched precision. The overview shown here focuses on the
light meson sector, presenting a detailed Partial-Wave Analysis of the
processes: $\pi^- p \to \pi^-\pi^+\pi^- p$ and $\pi^-p\to \pi^-\pi^0\pi^0p$. A
new state, the $a_1(1420)$ with $J^{PC}=1^{++}$ is observed. Its Breit-Wigner

$\Gamma = 130-150\,\mathrm{MeV}/c^2$. In the same analysis, a signal in a wave
with $J^{PC}=1^{-+}$ is observed. A resonant origin of this signal would not be
explicable within the CQM. In addition to this possibility of an exotic state,
a possible non resonant origin of this signal is discussed.

transverse wave velocities exhibit strong dependence on direction of

highly compressible materials, we show that both pressure and shear wave
velocities depend strongly on initial deformation and direction of propagation.
When compression is applied, longitudinal wave velocity decreases in positive
bulk modulus materials, and increases for negative bulk modulus materials; this
is regardless the direction of wave prorogation. We demonstrate that finite
deformations influence elastic wave propagation through combinations of induced
effective compressibility and stiffness.

magnetohydrodynamical (MHD) turbulence in the post decoupling era heats the
intergalactic medium (IGM). Delayed recombination of hydrogen atoms in the IGM
yields an optical depth to scattering of the cosmic microwave background (CMB).
The optical depth generated at $z\gg 10$ does not affect the ""reionization
bump"" of the CMB polarization power spectrum at low multipoles, but affects the
temperature and polarization power spectra at high multipoles. Writing the
present-day energy density of fields smoothed over the damping scale at the
decoupling epoch as $\rho_{B,0}=B_{0}^2/2$, we constrain $B_0$ as a function of
the spectral index, $n_B$. Using the Planck 2013 likelihood code that uses the
Planck temperature and lensing data together with the WMAP 9-year polarization
data, we find the 95% upper bounds of $B_0<0.63$, 0.39, and 0.18~nG for
$n_B=-2.9$, $-2.5$, and $-1.5$, respectively. For these spectral indices, the
optical depth is dominated by dissipation of the decaying MHD turbulence that
occurs shortly after the decoupling epoch. Our limits are stronger than the
previous limits ignoring the effects of the fields on ionization history.
Inverse Compton scattering of CMB photons off electrons in the heated IGM
distorts the thermal spectrum of CMB. Our limits on $B_0$ imply that the
$y$-type distortion from dissipation of fields in the post decoupling era
should be smaller than $10^{-9}$, $4\times10^{-9}$, and $10^{-9}$,
respectively.

and discuss the results of a systematic computer-simulation study aiming at
optimizing the type and performance of LXe converter. We have evaluated the
detector spectral response, detection efficiency and spatial resolution for
gamma-rays and neutrons in the energy range of 2-15 MeV for 50 mm thick
converters consisting of plain LXe volume and LXe-filled capillaries, of
Teflon, Polyethylene or hydrogen-containing Teflon (Tefzel). Neutron detection
efficiencies for plain LXe, Teflon-capillaries and Tefzel-capillaries
converters were about 20% over the entire energy range. In polyethylene
capillaries converters the neutron detection efficiency was about 10% at 2 MeV
and increased up to about 20% at 14 MeV. Detection efficiencies of gammas in
Teflon, Tefzel and polyethylene converters were ~35%. The plain-LXe converter
provided the highest gamma-ray detection efficiency, of ~40-50% for 2-15 MeV
energy range. Optimization of LXe-filled Tefzel capillary dimensions resulted
in spatial resolution of ~1.5mm (FWHM) for neutrons and up to 3.5 mm (FWHM) for
gamma-rays. Simulations of radiographic images of various materials using two
discrete energy gamma-rays (4.4 MeV and 15.1 MeV) and neutrons in broad energy
range (2-10 MeV) were performed in order to evaluate the potential of elemental
discrimination.

tracking, observer design and synchronisation problems for hybrid systems with

The so-called ""peaking phenomenon"", which occurs when using the Euclidean
distance to compare two hybrid trajectories, is circumvented by taking the
hybrid nature of the system explicitly into account in the design of the
distance function. Based on the proposed distance function, we define the
stability of a trajectory of a hybrid system with state-triggered jumps and
present sufficient Lyapunov-type conditions for stability of a hybrid
trajectory. A constructive design method for the distance function is presented
for hybrid systems with affine flow and jump maps and a jump set that is a
hyperplane. For this case, the mentioned Lyapunov-type stability conditions can
be verified using linear matrix conditions. Finally, for this class of systems,
we present a tracking controller that asymptotically stabilises a given hybrid
reference trajectory, and we illustrate our results with examples.

considered paradoxical and undesirable. This problem is discussed by many
social and natural sciences. The paper discusses a simple model of sequential
game in which two players in each iteration of the game choose one of the two
elements. They make their decisions in different contexts defined by the rules
of the game. It appears that the optimal strategy of one of the players can
only be intransitive! (the so-called \textsl{relevant intransitive
strategies}.) On the other hand, the optimal strategy for the second player can
be either transitive or intransitive. A quantum model of the game using pure
one-qubit strategies is considered. In this model, an increase in importance of
intransitive strategies is observed -- there is a certain course of the game
where intransitive strategies are the only optimal strategies for both players.
The study of decision-making models using quantum information theory tools may
shed some new light on the understanding of mechanisms that drive the formation
of types of preferences.

in which there are only two typical scales, i.e. the energy injection $L$ and
the dissipation scales $\eta$, here the quantization of vorticity introduces
two additional scales, i.e the vortex core radius $a_0$ and the mean vortex
