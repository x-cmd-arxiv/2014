$(M(t))_{t\geqslant 0}$ whose parameters are determined by an external Markov
process $(X(t))_{t\geqslant 0}$ on a finite state space $\{1,\ldots,d\}$; this
process is usually referred to as Markov-modulated Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (MMOU).
We use stochastic integration theory to determine explicit expressions for the
mean and variance of $M(t)$. Then we establish a system of partial differential
equations (PDEs) for the Laplace transform of $M(t)$ and the state $X(t)$ of
the background process, jointly for time epochs $t=t_1,\ldots,t_K.$ Then we use
this PDE to set up a recursion that yields all moments of $M(t)$ and its
stationary counterpart; we also find an expression for the covariance between
$M(t)$ and $M(t+u)$. We then establish a functional central limit theorem for
$M(t)$ for the situation that certain parameters of the underlying OU processes
are scaled, in combination with the modulating Markov process being
accelerated; interestingly, specific scalings lead to drastically different
limiting processes. We conclude the paper by considering the situation of a
single Markov process modulating multiple OU processes.

obtain the value G=6.67191(99) x 10^(-11) m^3 kg^(-1) s^(-2) with a relative
uncertainty of 150 parts per million (the combined standard uncertainty is

from the current recommended value of the Committee on Data for Science and

the systematic errors that have proved elusive in previous experiments, thus
improving the confidence in the value of G. There is no definitive relationship
between G and the other fundamental constants, and there is no theoretical
prediction for its value, against which to test experimental results. Improving
the precision with which we know G has not only a pure metrological interest,

under hydrostatic compression can preserve their elastic properties up to large
pressure values, while exhibiting exceptional resistance to mechanical
loadings. It was experimentally observed that CNTs with encapsulated linear
carbon chains (LCCs), when subjected to high hydrostatic pressure values,
present irreversible red shifts in some of their vibrational frequencies. In
order to address the cause of this phenomenon, we have carried out fully
atomistic reactive (ReaxFF) molecular dynamics (MD) simulations for model

of finite and infinite (cyclic boundary conditions) CNTs filled with LCCs (LCC

that increasing the hydrostatic pressure causes the CNT to be deformed in an
inhomogeneous way due to the LCC presence. The LCC-CNT interface regions
exhibit convex curvatures, which results in more reactive sites, thus favoring
the formation of covalent chemical bonds between the chain and the nanotube.
This process is irreversible with the newly formed bonds continuing to exist
even after releasing the external pressure and causing an irreversibly red
shift in the chain vibrational modes from 1850 to 1500 cm$^{-1}$.

minimum. We subject our theoretical model of hIAPP to repeated heating and
cooling simulations, back and forth between a high temperature regime where the
conformation resembles a random walker and a low temperature limit where no
thermal motions prevail. We find that the final low temperature conformations
display a high level of degeneracy, in a manner which is fully in line with the
presumed intrinsically disordered character of hIAPP. In particular, we
identify an isolated family of alpha-helical conformations that might cause the
transition to amyloidosis, by nucleation.

nondifferentiable, and therefore standard variational methods cannot be used
directly to prove the existence of critical points. Here we obtain a nontrivial
generalized solution $u$ of mountain pass type as the limit of mountain pass
points of a suitable sequence of $C^1$-functionals approximating the energy. We
show that $u$ minimizes the energy on the associated Nehari manifold and use
this fact to prove that it is nondegenerate. We use the nondegeneracy of $u$ to
show that it satisfies the free boundary condition in the viscosity sense.
Moreover, near any free boundary point that has a measure-theoretic normal, the
free boundary is a smooth surface, and hence the free boundary condition holds
in the classical sense.

  As an application, we demonstrate a tighter worst-case to average-case

types of breakpoint sequences: an exponential sequence with a constant density
and an initially uniform sequence with a density of points around the origin
that increases with time. These two multi-resolution schemes are tested in the
case of a one-dimensional gaussian potential and for atomic hydrogen. In the
latter case, we also use Sturmian functions to describe the scaled wave packet

basis characterized by a set of non-linear parameters. Regarding the continuum
part of the scaled wave packet, we show explicitly that, for large times, the
group velocity of each ionized wave packet goes to zero while its dispersion is
suppressed thereby explaining why, eventually, the scaled wave packet
associated to the ejected electrons becomes stationary. Finally, we show that
only the lowest scaled bound states can be removed from the total scaled wave

More specifically, we show how to sample $2^{n/2}$ vectors from the discrete
Gaussian distribution at any parameter in $2^{n+o(n)}$ time and space. (Prior
work only solved DGS for very large parameters.) Our SVP result then follows
from a natural reduction from SVP to DGS. We also show that our DGS algorithm
implies a $2^{n + o(n)}$-time algorithm that approximates the Closest Vector
Problem to within a factor of $1.97$.
  In addition, we give a more refined algorithm for DGS above the so-called
smoothing parameter of the lattice, which can generate $2^{n/2}$ discrete
Gaussian samples in just $2^{n/2+o(n)}$ time and space. Among other things,
this implies a $2^{n/2+o(n)}$-time and space algorithm for $1.93$-approximate
decision SVP.

of Titan, the Titan Atmospheric Model (TAM), which couples the Flexible
Modeling System (FMS) spectral dynamical core to a suite of
external/sub-grid-scale physics. These include a new non-gray radiative
transfer module that takes advantage of recent data from Cassini-Huygens,
large-scale condensation and quasi-equilibrium moist convection schemes, a
surface model with ""bucket"" hydrology, and boundary layer turbulent diffusion.
The model produces a realistic temperature structure from the surface to the
lower mesosphere, including a stratopause, as well as satisfactory
superrotation. The latter is shown to depend on the dynamical core's ability to
build up angular momentum from surface torques. Simulated latitudinal
temperature contrasts are adequate, compared to observations, and polar
temperature anomalies agree with observations. In the lower atmosphere, the
insolation distribution is shown to strongly impact turbulent fluxes, and
surface heating is maximum at mid-latitudes. Surface liquids are unstable at
mid- and low-latitudes, and quickly migrate poleward. The simulated humidity
profile and distribution of surface temperatures, compared to observations,
corroborate the prevalence of dry conditions at low latitudes. Polar cloud
activity is well represented, though the observed mid-latitude clouds remain
somewhat puzzling, and some formation alternatives are suggested.

circulation model of Titan's atmosphere, we simulate its climate under four

snapshots over the past 42 kyr, capturing the amplitude range of long-period
cyclic variations in eccentricity and longitude of perihelion. The model, which
covers pressures from the surface to 0.5 mbar, reproduces the present-day
temperature profile and tropospheric superrotation. In all four simulations,
the atmosphere efficiently transports methane poleward, drying out the low- and
mid-latitudes, indicating that these regions have been desert-like for at least
tens of thousands of years. Though circulation patterns are not significantly
different, the amount of surface methane that builds up over either pole
strongly depends on the insolation distribution; in the present-day, methane
builds up preferentially in the north, in agreement with observations, where
summer is milder but longer. The same is true, to a lesser extent, for the
configuration 14 kyr ago, while the south pole gains more methane in the case
for 28 kyr ago, and the system is almost symmetric 42 kyr ago. This confirms
the hypothesis that orbital forcing influences the distribution of surface
liquids, and that the current observed asymmetry could have been partially or
fully reversed in the past. The evolution of the orbital forcing implies that
the surface reservoir is transported on timescales of $\sim$30 kyr, in which
case the asymmetry reverses with a period of $\sim$125 kyr. Otherwise, the
orbital forcing does not produce a net asymmetry over longer timescales, and is
not a likely mechanism for generating the observed dichotomy.

circuits with a very large number of qubits and quantum gates. Fortunately,
these algorithms also tend to contain a small number of repetitively-used
quantum kernels. Identifying the quantum logic blocks that implement such
quantum kernels is critical to the complexity management for realizing the
corresponding quantum circuit. Moreover, quantum computation requires some type
of quantum error correction coding to combat decoherence, which in turn results
in a large number of ancilla qubits in the circuit. Sharing the ancilla qubits
among quantum operations (even though this sharing can increase the overall
circuit latency) is important in order to curb the resource demand of the
quantum algorithm. This paper presents a multi-core reconfigurable quantum
processor architecture, called Requp, which supports a layered approach to
mapping a quantum algorithm and ancilla sharing. More precisely, a scalable
quantum mapper, called Squash, is introduced, which divides a given quantum
circuit into a number of quantum kernels- each kernel comprises k parts such
that each part will run on exactly one of k available cores. Experimental
results demonstrate that Squash can handle large-scale quantum algorithms while
providing an effective mechanism for sharing ancilla qubits.

includes the preceding works given by Cho, Faddeev and Niemi, as a special case
called the maximal option in our reformulations. The advantage of our
reformulations is that the original non-Abelian gauge field variables can be
changed into the new field variables such that one of them called the
restricted field gives the dominant contribution to quark confinement in the
gauge-independent way. Our reformulations can be combined with the $SU(N)$
extension of the Diakonov-Petrov version of the non-Abelian Stokes theorem for
the Wilson loop operator to give a gauge-invariant definition for the magnetic
monopole in the $SU(N)$ Yang-Mills theory without the scalar field. In the
so-called minimal option, especially, the restricted field is non-Abelian and
involves the non-Abelian magnetic monopole with the stability group $U(N-1)$.
This suggests the non-Abelian dual superconductivity picture for quark
confinement. This should be compared with the maximal option: the restricted
field is Abelian and involves only the Abelian magnetic monopoles with the
stability group $U(1)^{N-1}$, just like the Abelian projection. We give some

has taken the utility vision of computing a step further by providing computing
resources such as network, storage, compute capacity and servers, as a service
via an internet connection. These services are provided to the users in a pay
per use manner subjected to the amount of usage of these resources by the cloud
users. Since the usage of these resources is done in an elastic manner thus an
on demand provisioning of these resources is the driving force behind the
entire cloud computing infrastructure therefore the maintenance of these
resources is a decisive task that must be taken into account. Eventually,
infrastructure level performance monitoring and enhancement is also important.
This paper proposes a framework for allocation of resources in a cloud based
environment thereby leading to an infrastructure level enhancement of
performance in a cloud environment. The framework is divided into four stages
Stage 1: Cloud service provider monitors the infrastructure level pattern of
usage of resources and behavior of the cloud users. Stage 2: Report the
monitoring activities about the usage to cloud service providers. Stage 3:
Apply proposed Network Bandwidth Dependent DMMM algorithm .Stage 4: Allocate
resources or provide services to cloud users, thereby leading to infrastructure
level performance enhancement and efficient management of resources. Analysis
of resource usage pattern is considered as an important factor for proper
allocation of resources by the service providers, in this paper Google cluster
trace has been used for accessing the resource usage pattern in cloud.
Experiments have been conducted on cloudsim simulation framework and the
results reveal that NBDMMM algorithm improvises allocation of resources in a
virtualized cloud.

that resources and infrastructure available at disposal must be equally
competent. Infrastructure level performance in cloud involves the performance
of servers, network and storage which act as the heart and soul for driving the
entire cloud business. Thus a constant improvement and enhancement of
infrastructure level performance is an important task that needs to be taken

enhancement in a cloud based environment. The framework is broadly divided into
four steps: a) Infrastructure level monitoring of usage pattern and behaviour
of the cloud end users, b) Reporting of the monitoring activities to the cloud
service provider c) Cloud service provider assigns priority according to our
decision matrix based max-min algorithm (DMMM) d) Providing services to cloud
users leading to infrastructure performance enhancement. Our framework is based
on decision matrix and monitoring in cloud using our proposed decision matrix

the communication channel must be monitored. Implementation of a monitoring
detector has largely been ignored so far, except for ID Quantique's commercial

Classical Statistical Field Theory (PCSFT), a model with hidden variables of
the field-type reproducing probabilistic predictions of quantum mechanics (QM).
PCSFT is combined with measurement theory based on detectors of the threshold
type. The latter describes discrete events corresponding to the continuous
fields model, PCSFT. Numerical modeling demonstrated that the classical
Brownian motion (the Wiener process valued in complex Hilbert space) producing
clicks when approaching the detection threshold gives probabilities of
detection predcited by the formalism QM (as well as PCSFT). This numerical
result is important, since the transition from PCSFT to the threshold detection
has a complex mathematical structure (in the framework of classical random
processes) and it was modeled only approximately. We also perform numerical
simulation for the PCSFT-value of the coefficient of second order coherence.
Our result matches well with the prediction of quantum theory. Thus, opposite
to semiclassical theory, PCSFT cannot be rejected as a consequence of
measurements of $g^{(2)}(0).$ Finally, we analyze the output of the recent

to CMOS 3T pixel. The feasibilty of this device was studied with technological
and transport simulations used in classical electron devices and process
design. A buried gate containing localized deep level centers (Deep Trapping
Gate or DTG) is the key for the operation of this field effect pixel detector.
This can be made with deep levels or a quantum box. This buried gate can
modulates the drain-source current, the same way the upper gate does. This
principle was evaluated with realistic simulations physical parameters and this
shows that the signal magnitude is sufficient for an energy deposition of a
Minimum Ionizing Particle within a limited silicon thickness (a few microns).
We will study here the potential techniques usable for the fabrication of the
device with their drawbacks, advantages and limits. The first technique
introduced is impurity implantation, followed by annealing. The problems
related to the control of the defects in the DTG will be examined in the light
of recent work on ion implantation. As an alternative recent work on quantum

again be used with some limitations. As an alternative to ion implantation an
epitaxial DTG could be fabricated using standard techniques. The first
conclusion of this study is that all the established techniques necessary for
the development of the DTG pixel can reasonably be successful because the
related bottlenecks may be overcome. The deep levels concentration in the DTG

years. Currently there exist a few different types of $q$-analogs of the MZVs
($q$-MZVs) defined and studied by mathematicians and physicists. In this paper,
we give a uniform treatment of these $q$-MZVs by considering their double
shuffle relations (DBSFs) and duality relations. The main idea is a
modification and generalization of the one used by Castillo Medina et al. who
have considered the DBSFs of a special type of $q$-MZVs. We generalize their
method to a few other types of $q$-MZVs including the one defined by the author
in 2003. With different approach, Takeyama has already studied this type by
""regularization"" and observed that there exist $\mathbb Q$-linear relations
which are not consequences of the DBSFs. He also discovered a new family of
relations which we call the duality relations in this paper. This deficiency of
DBSFs occurs among other types, too, so we generalize the duality relations to
all of these values and find that there are still some missing relations. This
leads to the most general type of $q$-MZVs together with a new kind of
relations called $\bf P$-$\bf Q$ relations which are used to lower the
deficiencies further. As an application, we will confirm a conjecture of
Okounkov on the dimensions of certain $q$-MZV spaces, either theoretically or
numerically, for the weight up to 12. Some relevant numerical data are provided
at the end.

describe automatic preconditioning techniques for iterative methods for solving
such sequences of systems by maintaining an estimate of the inverse system
matrix. We update the estimate of the inverse system matrix with quasi-Newton
type formulas based on what we call an action constraint instead of the secant
equation. We implement the estimated inverses as preconditioners in a Newton-CG
method and prove quadratic termination. Our implementation is the first
parallel quasi-Newton preconditioners, in full and limited memory variants.
Tests on logistic Support Vector Machine problems reveal that our method is
very efficient, converging in wall clock time before a Newton-CG method without
preconditioning. Further tests on a set of classic test problems reveal that
the method is robust. The action constraint makes these updates flexible enough
to mesh with trust-region and active set methods, a flexibility that is not
present in classic quasi-Newton methods.

The film is prepared by Pulsed Laser Deposition (PLD) at different
temperatures. A PdCl2 (aq) droplet is injected on the surface and in the
presence of steam hydrogen the droplet is dried through a reduction reaction
process. Two distinct aggregation regimes of palladium colloids are observed
over the substrates. We argue that the change in aggregation dynamics emerges
when the measured water drop Contact Angel (CA) for the WO3/glass thin films
passes a certain threshold value, namely CA = 46 degrees, where a crossover in
kinetic aggregation of palladium colloids occurs. Our results suggest that the
mass fractal dimension of palladium aggregates follows a power-law behavior.
The fractal dimension (Df) in the fast aggregation regime, where the measured
CA values vary from 27 up to 46 degrees, according to different substrate
deposition temperatures, is Df = 1.75 (0.02). This value of Df is in excellent
agreement with kinetic aggregation of other colloidal systems in fast
aggregation regime. Whereas for the slow aggregation regime, with CA = 58
degrees, the fractal dimension changes abruptly to Df=1.92 (0.03). We have also
used a modified Box-Counting method to calculate fractal dimension of
gray-level images and observe that the crossover at around CA = 46 degrees
remains unchanged.

merged together to reflect the close relationship between the two calculi
through the First Fundamental Theorem of Calculus. In this paper we study this
relationship from a categorical point of view in the context of distributive
laws which can be tracked back to the distributive law of multiplication over
addition. The monad giving Rota-Baxter algebras and the comonad giving
differential algebras are constructed. Then a mixed distributive law of the
monad over the comonad is established. As a consequence, we obtain monads and
comonads giving the composite structures of differential and Rota-Baxter
algebras.

description of nanodecomposition, performed by combining first-principles
calculations with kinetic Monte Carlo simulations, is discussed together with
extensive electron microscopy, synchrotron radiation, scanning probe, and ion
beam methods that have been employed to visualize binodal and spinodal
nanodecomposition (chemical phase separation) as well as nanoprecipitation
(crystallographic phase separation) in a range of semiconductor compounds with
a concentration of transition metal (TM) impurities beyond the solubility
limit. The role of growth conditions, co-doping by shallow impurities, kinetic
barriers, and surface reactions in controlling the aggregation of magnetic
cations is highlighted. According to theoretical simulations and experimental
results the TM-rich regions appear either in the form of nanodots (the {\em
dairiseki} phase) or nanocolumns (the {\em konbu} phase) buried in the host
semiconductor. Particular attention is paid to Mn-doped group III arsenides and
antimonides, TM-doped group III nitrides, Mn- and Fe-doped Ge, and Cr-doped
group II chalcogenides, in which ferromagnetic features persisting up to above
room temperature correlate with the presence of nanodecomposition and account
for the application-relevant magneto-optical and magnetotransport properties of
these compounds. Finally, it is pointed out that spinodal nanodecomposition can
be viewed as a new class of bottom-up approach to nanofabrication.

function and the sampling, capturing in a compact way certain smoothness
properties of the function in a random subspace spanned by the sampled
coordinates. ESO inequalities were previously established for special classes
of samplings only, almost invariably for uniform samplings. In this paper we
develop a systematic technique for deriving these inequalities for a large
class of functions and for arbitrary samplings. We demonstrate that one can
recover existing ESO results using our general approach, which is based on the
study of eigenvalues associated with samplings and the data describing the
function.

deflagrations are known to be hydrodynamically unstable for wall velocities
below a certain critical value. We calculate this critical velocity for several

noninertial, nonrelativistic reference frames. The set of these transformations
has the structure of an infinite dimensional Lie group, called the Galilean
line group, which contains as a subgroup the Galilei group. We show that the
fictitious forces of noninertial reference frames are naturally encoded in the
Cartan connection transformed under the Galilean line group. These noninertial
forces, which are coordinate effects, do not contribute to the Ricci tensor
which describes the curvature of Newtonian spacetime. We show that only the
$00$-component of the Ricci tensor is non-zero and equal to ($4\pi$ times) the
matter density in any inertial or noninetial reference frame and that it leads
to what may be called Newtonian ADM mass. While the Ricci field equation and
Gauss law are both fulfilled by the same physical matter density in inertial
and linearly accelerating reference frames, there appears a discrepancy between
the two in rotating reference frames in that Gauss law holds for an effective
mass density that differs from the physical matter density. This effective
density has its origin in the simulated magnetic field that appears in rotating
frames, highlighting a rather striking difference between linearly and
rotationally accelerating reference frames. We further show that the dynamical
equations that govern the simulated gravitational and magnetic fields have the
same form as Maxwell's equations, a surprising conclusion given that these
equations are well-known to obey special relativity (and $U(1)$-gauge
symmetry), rather than Galilean symmetry.

  which erroneously claimed strong parallel repetition for free entangled
  games. Fixed author order to alphabetical",,,,"quant-ph cs.CC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We present two parallel repetition theorems for the entangled value of
multi-player, one-round free games (games where the inputs come from a product
distribution). Our first theorem shows that for a $k$-player free game $G$ with
entangled value $\mathrm{val}^*(G) = 1 - \epsilon$, the $n$-fold repetition of
$G$ has entangled value $\mathrm{val}^*(G^{\otimes n})$ at most $(1 -
\epsilon^{3/2})^{\Omega(n/sk^4)}$, where $s$ is the answer length of any
player. In contrast, the best known parallel repetition theorem for the
classical value of two-player free games is $\mathrm{val}(G^{\otimes n}) \leq
(1 - \epsilon^2)^{\Omega(n/s)}$, due to Barak, et al. (RANDOM 2009). This
suggests the possibility of a separation between the behavior of entangled and
classical free games under parallel repetition.
  Our second theorem handles the broader class of free games $G$ where the
players can output (possibly entangled) quantum states. For such games, the
repeated entangled value is upper bounded by $(1 -
\epsilon^2)^{\Omega(n/sk^2)}$. We also show that the dependence of the exponent
on $k$ is necessary: we exhibit a $k$-player free game $G$ and $n \geq 1$ such
that $\mathrm{val}^*(G^{\otimes n}) \geq \mathrm{val}^*(G)^{n/k}$.
  Our analysis exploits the novel connection between communication protocols
and quantum parallel repetition, first explored by Chailloux and Scarpa (ICALP
2014). We demonstrate that better communication protocols yield better parallel
repetition theorems: our first theorem crucially uses a quantum search protocol
by Aaronson and Ambainis, which gives a quadratic speed-up for distributed
search problems. Finally, our results apply to a broader class of games than
were previously considered before; in particular, we obtain the first parallel
repetition theorem for entangled games involving more than two players, and for
games involving quantum outputs.
