controlling parameter is tuned towards a critical point. An important question
is whether such a critical point exists in a particular system and how stable
it is. Here, we identify the critical point of a quantum phase transition as a
singular point in the affine algebraic variety of the characteristic equation
for the Hamiltonian describing the system, with an unstable critical point
being associated with an isolated singular point which has a finite Tjurina
number. The theory is illustrated by studying a model system of
zero-dimensional (finite) Heisenberg spin chain with an impurity, which
exhibits a nontrivial first-order quantum phase transition. Both analytical and
numerical calculations show that the quantum phase transition always exists
when the impurity has a $Z_2$ symmetry but only remains in systems with an even
number of spin sites when the $Z_2$ symmetry is broken.

finite-dimensional linear discrete time invariant system with two output
signals, one of which is directly observed while the other has to be estimated.
The system is assumed to be driven by a random disturbance produced from the
Gaussian white noise sequence by an unknown shaping filter. The worst-case
performance of an estimator is quantified by the maximum ratio of the
root-mean-square (RMS) value of the estimation error to that of the disturbance
over stationary Gaussian disturbances whose mean anisotropy is bounded from
above by a given parameter $a \ge 0$. The mean anisotropy is a combined entropy
theoretic measure of temporal colouredness and spatial ""nonroundness"" of a
signal. We construct an $a$-anisotropic estimator which minimizes the
worst-case error-to-noise RMS ratio. The estimator retains the general
structure of the Kalman filter, though with modified state-space matrices.
Computing the latter is reduced to solving a set of two coupled algebraic
Riccati equations and an equation involving the determinant of a matrix. In two
limiting cases, where $a = 0$ or $a \to +\infty$, the $a$-anisotropic estimator
leads to the standard steady-state Kalman filter or the $H_{\infty}$-optimal
estimator, respectively.

that the maximum enhancement occurs in the branching ratio of $\bar B^0_s\to

pilot sample contains the first five sources observed as part of a larger
effort to characterize HI sources with no readily identifiable optical
counterpart at single dish resolution. These objects span a range of HI mass
[7.41 < log(M$_{\rm HI}$) < 9.51] and HI mass to B-band luminosity ratios (3 <
M$_{\rm HI}$/L$_{\rm B}$ < 9). We compare the HI total intensity and velocity
fields to SDSS optical imaging and to archival GALEX UV imaging. Four of the
sources with uncertain or no optical counterpart in the ALFALFA data are
identified with low surface brightness optical counterparts in SDSS imaging
when compared with VLA HI intensity maps, and appear to be galaxies with clear
signs of ordered rotation. One source (AGC 208602) is likely tidal in nature.

reveal complex sources with suppressed star formation, highlighting both the
observational difficulties and the necessity of synthesis follow-up

of replication or erasure correcting codes. While erasure correcting codes
offer a better storage efficiency than replication for similar fault tolerance,
they incur higher CPU consumption, higher network consumption and higher disk
I/Os. To address these issues, codes specific to storage systems have been
designed. Their main feature is the ability to repair a single lost disk
efficiently. In this paper, we focus on one such class of codes that minimize
network consumption during repair, namely regenerating codes. We implement the
original Product-Matrix Regenerating codes as well as a new optimization we
propose and show that the resulting optimized codes allow achieving 790 MB/s
for encoding in typical settings. Reported speeds are significantly higher than
previous studies, highlighting that regenerating codes can be used with little

$(c,k)$-Load Coloring Problem (denoted $(c,k)$-LCP) asks whether there is a
$c$-coloring $\varphi: V \rightarrow [c]$ such that for every $i \in [c]$,
there are at least $k$ edges with both endvertices colored $i$. Gutin and Jones
(IPL 2014) studied this problem with $c=2$. They showed $(2,k)$-LCP to be fixed
parameter tractable (FPT) with parameter $k$ by obtaining a kernel with at most
$7k$ vertices. In this paper, we extend the study to any fixed $c$ by giving
both a linear-vertex and a linear-edge kernel. In the particular case of $c=2$,
we obtain a kernel with less than $4k$ vertices and less than $8k$ edges. These
results imply that for any fixed $c\ge 2$, $(c,k)$-LCP is FPT and that the
optimization version of $(c,k)$-LCP (where $k$ is to be maximized) has an
approximation algorithm with a constant ratio for any fixed $c\ge 2$.

to the formation of dark and bright superpositions of the light which
experience different absorption and dispersion. We show that this feature can
be exploited to filter the incident photon in such a way that only a desired

strengthening of property (T), that we call property (T*), which is a natural
obstruction to the AP. In order to define property (T*), we first prove that
for every locally compact group G, there exists a unique left invariant mean on
the space of completely bounded Fourier multipliers of G. A locally compact
group G is said to have property (T*) if this mean is a weak* continuous
functional. After proving that the groups SL(3,R), Sp(2,R), and the universal
covering of Sp(2,R) have property (T*), we address the question which connected
Lie groups have the AP. A technical problem that arises when considering this
question from the point of view of the AP is that the semisimple part of the
global Levi decomposition of a connected Lie group need not be closed. Because
of an important permanence property of property (T*), this problem vanishes. It
follows that a connected Lie group has the AP if and only if all simple factors
in the semisimple part of its Levi decomposition have real rank 0 or 1.
Finally, we are able to establish property (T*) for all connected simple higher
rank Lie groups with finite center.

coordinate their activities across three key levels of the university and to

polyhedral complex in Sigma is relatively realizable, i.e. whether it is the
tropicalization of an algebraic curve, over the field of Puiseux series over K,
in X. The algorithm implies that the space of all such relatively realizable

  In the case when X is a general plane in 3-space, we use the idea of this
algorithm to prove some necessary and some sufficient conditions for relative
realizability. For 1-dimensional polyhedral complexes in Sigma that have
exactly one bounded edge, passing through the origin, these necessary and

low density hydrogen plasma. The calculations took into account the full
chamber geometry, including the plasma probe as an electrode in the chamber. It
was found that the simulations reproduce the time evolution of the probe IV
characteristics with good accuracy. The disagreement between the simulated and
probe measured plasma density is attributed to the limited applicability of
probe theory to measurements of low density pulsed plasmas. Indeed, in the case
studied here, probe measurements would lead to a large overestimate of the
plasma density. In contrast, the simulations of the plasma evolution and the
probe characteristics do not suffer from such strict applicability limits.
These studies show that probe theory cannot be justified through probe
measurements.

generally focused on one of three areas: developing reflective teachers,
disseminating curricula and pedagogy, or enacting institutional policy. These
efforts illustrate many of the challenges of departmental change; in
particular, they highlight the need for a holistic approach that integrates
across all three of these levels: individual faculty, whole departments, and
university policymakers. To address these challenges, as part of our
campus-wide AAU-sponsored effort in STEM education transformation, we import
and integrate models of change from multiple perspectives. We draw from models
in organizational change, from departmental and disciplinary change in STEM
education, and from efforts to support individual efforts such as the
development and dissemination model. As a result, our departmental cultural
change efforts are an attempt at holistic reform. We will discuss our
theoretical underpinnings and ground this theory in a sample of approaches in
two departments.

loops at the highest temperatures normally achieved in the flare process. Their
ubiquity has led to their use as a standard measure of flare occurrence and
energy, although the overwhelming bulk of the total flare energy goes
elsewhere. Recently Dolla et al. (2012) noted quasi-periodic pulsations (QPP)
in the soft X-ray signature of the X-class flare SOL2011-02-15, as observed by
the standard photometric data from the GOES (Geostationary Operational
Environmental Satellite) spacecraft. In this paper we analyze the suitability
of the GOES data for this kind of analysis and find them to be generally
valuable after September, 2010 (GOES-15). We then extend the Dolla et al.
result to a complete list of X-class flares from Cycle 24, and show that most
of them (80%) display QPPs in the impulsive phase. The pulsations show up
cleanly in both channels of the GOES data, making use of time-series of
irradiance differences (the digital time derivative on the 2-s sampling). We
deploy different techniques to characterize the periodicity of GOES pulsations,
considering the red-noise properties of the flare signals, finding a range of
chracteristic time scales of the QPPs for each event, but usually with no
strong signature of a single period dominating in the power spectrum. The QPP
may also appear on somewhat longer time scales during the later gradual phase,
possibly with a greater tendency towards coherence, but the sampling noise in
GOES difference data for large irradiance values (X-class flares) makes these
more uncertain. We show that there is minimal phase difference between the
differenced GOES energy channels, or between them and the hard X-ray variations
on short time scales. During the impulsive phase the footpoints of the
newly-forming flare loops may also contribute to the observed soft X-ray
variations.

transcriptome and scoring transcripts as differentially or equally expressed
between two biological conditions. Although these two tasks are closely linked,
the available inference methods treat them separately: a primary model is used
to estimate expression and its output is post-processed using a differential
expression model. In this paper, both issues are simultaneously addressed by
proposing the joint estimation of expression levels and differential
expression: the unknown relative abundance of each transcript can either be
equal or not between two conditions. A hierarchical Bayesian model builds upon
the BitSeq framework and the posterior distribution of transcript expression
and differential expression is inferred using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC).
It is shown that the proposed model enjoys conjugacy for fixed dimension
variables, thus the full conditional distributions are analytically derived.
Two samplers are constructed, a reversible jump MCMC sampler and a collapsed
Gibbs sampler, and the latter is found to perform best. A cluster
representation of the aligned reads to the transcriptome is introduced,
allowing parallel estimation of the marginal posterior distribution of subsets
of transcripts under reasonable computing time. The proposed algorithm is
benchmarked against alternative methods using synthetic datasets and applied to
real RNA-sequencing data. Source code is available online

of a class of degenerate elliptic and parabolic Partial Differential Equations
(PDEs). These methods are best suited to regular rectangular grids, which leads
to low accuracy near curved boundaries or singularities of solutions. In this
article we combine monotone finite difference methods with an adaptive grid
refinement technique to produce a PDE discretization and solver which is
applied to a broad class of equations, in curved or unbounded domains which
include free boundaries. The grid refinement is flexible and adaptive. The
discretization is combined with a fast solution method, which incorporates
asynchronous time stepping adapted to the spatial scale. The framework is
validated on linear problems in curved and unbounded domains. Key applications
include the obstacle problem and the one-phase Stefan free boundary problem.

quasilinear wave equation \begin{equation}\label{Main Equation}
  - \big(1+3G^{\prime\prime}(0) (\partial_t\phi)^2\big)\partial^2_t \phi
+\Delta\phi=0,\tag{\textbf{$\star$}} \end{equation} where $G^{\prime\prime}(0)$
is a non-zero constant. We will exhibit a family of smooth initial data and
show that the foliation of the incoming characteristic hypersurfaces collapses.
Similar to 1-dimensional conservational laws, we refer this specific type
breakdown of smooth solutions as shock formation. Since $(\star)$ satisfies the
classical null condition, it admits global smooth solutions for small data.
Therefore, we will work with large data (in energy norm). Moreover, no symmetry
condition is imposed on the initial datum. We emphasize the geometric
perspectives of shock formations in the proof. More specifically, the key idea
is to study the interplay between the following two objects: (1) the energy
estimates of the linearized equations of $(\star)$; (2) the differential
geometry of the Lorentzian metric $g=-\dfrac{1}{\left(1+3G^{\prime\prime}(0)
(\partial_t\phi)^2\right)} d t^2+dx_1^2+dx_2^2+dx_3^2$. Indeed, the study of
the characteristic hypersurfaces (implies shock formation) is the study of the
null hypersurfaces of $g$. The techniques in the proof are inspired by the work
\cite{Ch-Shocks} in which the formation of shocks for $3$-dimensional
relativistic compressible Euler equations with small initial data is
established. We also use the short pulse method which is introduced in the
study of formation of black holes in general relativity in \cite{Ch-BlackHoles}
and generalized in \cite{K-R-09}.

expansion of the pressure show that this quantity raises with the temperature
towards the Stefan-Boltzmann limit. On the other hand, model approximations
predict that when a vector repulsion, parametrized by $G_V$, is present this
coefficient reaches a maximum just after $T_c$ and then deviates from the
lattice predictions. Recently, this discrepancy has been used as a guide to
constrain the (presently unknown) value of $G_V$ within the framework of
effective models at large-$N_c$ (LN). In the present investigation we show
that, due to finite $N_c$ effects, $c_2$ may also develop a maximum even when
$G_V=0$ since a vector repulsive term can be dynamically generated by exchange
type of radiative corrections. Here we apply the the Optimized Perturbation
Theory (OPT) method to the two flavor Polyakov--Nambu--Jona-Lasinio model (at
$G_V=0$) and compare the results with those furnished by lattice simulations an
by the LN approximation at $G_V=0$ and also at $G_V \ne 0$. The OPT numerical
results for $c_2$ are impressively accurate for $T \lesssim 1.2\, T_c$ but, as
expected, predict that this quantity develops a maximum at high-$T$. After
identifying the mathematical origin of this extremum we argue that such a
discrepant behavior may naturally arise within these effective quark models (at
$G_V=0$) whenever the first $1/N_c$ corrections are taken into account. We then
interpret this hypothesis as an indication that beyond the large-$N_c$ limit
the correct high temperature (perturbative) behavior of $c_2$ will be
faithfully described by effective models only if they also mimic the asymptotic
freedom phenomenon.

action for problems in nonconservative classical mechanics and extend it to
classical field theories. The variational calculus used is consistent with an
initial value formulation of physical problems and allows for time-irreversible
processes, such as dissipation, to be included at the level of the action. In
this formalism, the equations of motion are generated by extremizing a
nonconservative action $\mathcal{S}$, which is a functional of a doubled set of
degrees of freedom. The corresponding nonconservative Lagrangian contains a
potential $K$ which generates nonconservative forces and interactions. Such a
nonconservative potential can arise in several ways, including from an open
system interacting with inaccessible degrees of freedom or from integrating out
or coarse-graining a subset of variables in closed systems. We generalize
Noether's theorem to show how Noether currents are modified and no longer
conserved when $K$ is non-vanishing. Consequently, the nonconservative aspects
of a physical system are derived solely from $K$. We show how to use the
formalism with examples of nonconservative actions for discrete systems
including forced damped harmonic oscillators, radiation reaction on an
accelerated charge, and RLC circuits. We present examples for nonconservative
classical field theories. Our approach naturally allows for irreversible
thermodynamic processes to be included in an unconstrained variational
principle. We present the nonconservative action for a Navier-Stokes fluid
including the effects of viscous dissipation and heat diffusion, as well as an
action that generates the Maxwell model for viscoelastic materials, which can
be easily generalized to more realistic rheological models. We show that the
nonconservative action can be derived as the classical limit of a more complete
quantum theory.

difficulties associated with understanding neutrino interaction cross sections
on atomic nuclei are expected to limit experimental sensitivities to
oscillation parameters. In particular, the ability to relate experimental
observables to neutrino energy in previous experiments has relied solely on
theoretical models of neutrino-nucleus interactions, which currently suffer
from very large theoretical uncertainties.
  By observing charged current $\nu_\mu$ interactions over a continuous range
of off-axis angles from 1 to 4 degrees, the nuPRISM water Cherenkov detector
can provide a direct measurement of the far detector lepton kinematics for any
given set of oscillation parameters, which largely removes neutrino interaction
modeling uncertainties from T2K oscillation measurements. This naturally
provides a direct constraint on the relationship between lepton kinematics and
neutrino energy. In addition, nuPRISM is a sensitive probe of sterile neutrino
oscillations with multiple energy spectra, which provides unique constraints on
possible background-related explanations of the MiniBooNE anomaly. Finally,
high-precision measurements of neutrino cross sections on water are possible,
including $\nu_e$ measurements and the first ever measurements of neutral
current interactions as a function of neutrino energy.
  The nuPRISM detector also benefits the proposed Hyper-Kamiokande project. A
demonstration that neutrino interaction uncertainties can be controlled will be
important to understanding the physics reach of Hyper-K. In addition, nuPRISM
will provide an easily accessible prototype detector for many of the new
hardware components currently under consideration for Hyper-K. The following
document presents the configuration, physics impact, and preliminary cost
estimates for a nuPRISM detector in the J-PARC neutrino beamline.

that we allow for a wide family of non-polynomial filter-banks.

Kelvin. Based on these two facts we use the Partially Screened Gap (PSG) model
to describe the Inner Acceleration Region (IAR). The PSG model assumes that the
temperature of the actual polar cap is equal to the so-called critical value,
i.e. the temperature at which the outflow of thermal ions from the surface
screens the gap completely. We have found that, depending on the conditions
above the polar cap, the generation of high energetic photons in IAR can be
caused either by Curvature Radiation (CR) or by Inverse Compton Scattering
(ICS). Completely different properties of both processes result in two
different scenarios of breaking the acceleration gap: the so-called PSG-off
mode for the gap dominated by CR and the PSG-on mode for the gap dominated by

explains the mode-changing phenomenon. Different characteristics of plasma

causes a steady-state temperature T_0 + Delta T sin(2pi x/L). A thermal
conductivity kappa(q) is extracted, which is well converged at the chosen q (or

tested for liquid and crystalline argon. One advantage is reduced computational
noise at a given total MD run time. Another advantage is that kappa(q) has a
more physical meaning than kappa(L). It can be easily studied using
Peierls-Boltzmann transport theory. New formulas for kappa(q) in simplified

gracefully. Approximate solutions such as Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH) and
its Bayesian variants (BayesLSH and BayesLSHLite) alleviate the problem to some
extent and provides substantial speedup over traditional index based
approaches. BayesLSH is used for pruning the candidate space and computation of
approximate similarity, whereas BayesLSHLite can only prune the candidates, but
similarity needs to be computed exactly on the original data. Thus where ever
the explicit data representation is available and exact similarity computation
is not too expensive, BayesLSHLite can be used to aggressively prune candidates

the loss in quality is higher in the BayesLSH variant, where explicit data

leveraged by such LSH algorithms for adaptively pruning candidates

from the Chandra X-ray Observatory's 3 Ms Sgr A* X-ray Visionary Project (XVP)
in 2012. Our analysis indicates that the observed X-ray flux distribution can
be decomposed into a steady quiescent component, represented by a Poisson
process with rate $Q=(5.24\pm0.08)\times10^{-3}$ cts s$^{-1},$ and a variable
component, represented by a power law process ($dN/dF\propto F^{-\xi},$
$\xi=1.92_{-0.02}^{+0.03}$). This slope matches our recently-reported
distribution of flare luminosities. The variability may also be described by a
log-normal process with a median unabsorbed 2-8 keV flux of
$1.8^{+0.9}_{-0.6}\times10^{-14}$ erg s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$ and a shape parameter
$\sigma=2.4\pm0.2,$ but the power law provides a superior description of the
data. In this decomposition of the flux distribution, all of the intrinsic
X-ray variability of Sgr A* (spanning at least three orders of magnitude in
flux) can be attributed to flaring activity, likely in the inner accretion
flow. We confirm that at the faint end, the variable component contributes ~10%
of the apparent quiescent flux, as previously indicated by our statistical
analysis of X-ray flares in these Chandra observations. Our flux distribution
provides a new and important observational constraint on theoretical models of
Sgr A*, and we use simple radiation models to explore the extent to which a

probing the blind spot region. For specific natural SUSY scenarios such as

For well separated particles at tree-level, we prove the Low-Burnett-Kroll

insertions which are individually gauge invariant. These contributions are
uniquely determined by gauge invariance and the reparametrization invariance

However the latter is slightly richer in satellites, slightly thinner and has
stronger co-rotation, which makes it stand out as overall more exceptional than
the simulated planes, when compared to a random population. Although the
simulated planes we find are generally dominated by one real structure, forming
its backbone, they are also partly fortuitous and are thus not kinematically
coherent structures as a whole. Provided that the simulated and observed planes

Molecular gas is traced by CO line emission and star formation rate (SFR) is
derived using the combination of far-ultraviolet and mid-infrared (MIR) data.
The contribution of old stars to MIR emission for the ATLAS3D sample is
corrected using 2MASS K-band images. We apply a two-dimensional image
decomposition algorithm to decompose galaxies into bulges and discs. Spiral
arms, bars and rings are identified in the residual maps, and molecular gas
depletion times are derived on a square grid of 1 kpc^2 size. In previous work,
we showed that Tdep correlates strongly with specific star formation rate
(sSFR). We now find that at a given sSFR, the bulge has shorter Tdep than the
disc. The shift to shorter depletion times is most pronounced in the inner
bulge (R < 0.1Re). Grids from galaxies with bars and rings are similar to those
from galactic bulges in that they have reduced Tdep at a given sSFR. In
contrast, the Tdep versus sSFR relation in the discs of galaxies with spiral
arms is displaced to longer Tdep at fixed sSFR. We then show that the
differences in the Tdep-sSFR relation for bulges, discs, arms, bars and rings
can be linked to variations in ""stellar"", rather than gas surface density
between different structures. Our best current predictor for Tdep, both
globally and for 1 kpc grids, is given by Tdep=

However, there has been a steady accumulation of evidence for discrepancies
between simulations and observations at scales smaller than galaxy clusters.
Solutions to these small scale structure problems may indicate that simulations
need to improve how they include feedback from baryonic matter, or may imply
that dark matter properties differ from the standard cold, noninteracting
scenario. One promising way to affect structure formation on small scales is a
relatively strong coupling of dark matter to neutrinos. We construct an
experimentally viable, simple, renormalizable, model with new interactions
between neutrinos and dark matter. We show that addressing the small scale
structure problems requires dark matter with a mass that is tens of MeV, and a
present-day density determined by an initial particle-antiparticle asymmetry in
the dark sector. Generating a sufficiently large dark matter-neutrino coupling
requires a new heavy neutrino with a mass around 100 MeV. The heavy neutrino is
mostly sterile but has a substantial $\tau$ neutrino component, while the three
nearly massless neutrinos are partly sterile. We provide the first discussion
of how such dark matter-neutrino interactions affect neutrino (especially
$\tau$ neutrino) phenomenology. This model can be tested by future
astrophysical, particle physics, and neutrino oscillation data. A feature in
the neutrino energy spectrum and flavor content from a future nearby supernova
would provide strong evidence of neutrino-dark matter interactions. Promising
signatures include anomalous matter effects in neutrino oscillations due to
nonstandard interactions and a component of the $\tau$ neutrino with mass
around 100 MeV.

A, B and C. The Hamiltonian of the system is expanded in ratios of the three
binary separations, and orbit-averaged. Subsequently, we numerically solve the
equations of motion. We study highly hierarchical systems that are well
described by the lowest-order terms in the Hamiltonian. We find that the
qualitative behaviour is determined by the ratio $\mathcal{R}_0$ of the initial
Kozai-Lidov (KL) time-scales of the binary pairs AB and BC. If
$\mathcal{R}_0\ll 1$, binaries AB remain coplanar if this is initially the
case, and KL eccentricity oscillations in binary B are efficiently quenched. If
$\mathcal{R}_0\gg 1$, binaries AB become inclined, even if initially coplanar.
However, there are no induced KL eccentricity oscillations in binary A. Lastly,
if $\mathcal{R}_0\sim 1$, complex KL eccentricity oscillations can occur in
binary A that are coupled with the KL eccentricity oscillations in B. Even if
binaries A and B are initially coplanar, the induced inclination can result in
very high eccentricity oscillations in binary A. These extreme eccentricities
could have significant implications for strong interactions such as tidal
interactions, gravitational wave dissipation, and collisions and mergers of
stars and compact objects. As an example, we apply our results to a planet+moon
system orbiting a central star, which in turn is orbited by a distant and
inclined stellar companion or planet, and to observed stellar quadruples.

effective description of the critical point and of the ""badly conducting"" state
found near the critical point on the delocalized side. The theory leads to the
following sharp predictions: (i) The delocalized state established near the
transition is a Griffiths phase, which exhibits sub-diffusive transport of
conserved quantities and sub-ballistic spreading of entanglement. The anomalous
diffusion exponent $\alpha < 1/2$ vanishes continuously at the critical point.
The system does thermalize in this Griffiths phase. (ii) The many-body
localization transition is controlled by a new kind of infinite randomness RG
fixed point, where the broadly distributed scaling variable is closely related
to the eigenstate entanglement entropy. Dynamically, the entanglement grows as
$\sim\log t$ at the critical point, as it also does in the localized phase.
(iii) In the vicinity of the critical point the ratio of the entanglement
entropy to the thermal entropy, and its variance (and in fact all moments) are
scaling functions of $L/\xi$, where $L$ is the length of the system and $\xi$

allow a non-Kahler metric on the resolved conifold, supersymmetry can easily be
restored. The vanishing of the (1, 2) fluxes here corresponds to, under certain

a class of explicit non-Kahler metrics on the resolved conifold satisfying the

one assumes that the pomeron has a well defined partonic structure, and that

leading-order gluon-gluon fusion and quark-antiquark anihilation partonic

distributions in the pomeron are taken from the H1 Collaboration analysis of

corrections from subleading reggeon exchanges are explicitly calculated and are
also taken into consideration. Several quark-level differential distributions

failure models are too crude to describe the different kinds of trust and
expectations of participants in the modern world of complex, integrated systems
extending across different owners, networks, and administrative domains. Modern
systems often exist in an environment of heterogeneous trust, in which
different participants may have different opinions about the trustworthiness of
other nodes, and a single participant may consider other nodes to differ in
their trustworthiness. We explore how to construct distributed protocols that
meet the requirements of all participants, even in heterogeneous trust
environments. The key to our approach is using lattice-based information flow
to analyse and prove protocol properties. To demonstrate this approach, we show
how two earlier distributed algorithms can be generalized to work in the
presence of heterogeneous trust: first, Heterogeneous Fast Consensus, an
adaptation of the earlier Bosco Fast Consensus protocol; and second, Nysiad, an
algorithm for converting crash-tolerant protocols to be Byzantine-tolerant.
Through simulations, we show that customizing a protocol to a heterogeneous
trust configuration yields performance improvements over the conventional
protocol designed for homogeneous trust.

from tracing out the short-distance degrees of freedom. The dynamics of this

short time scale. We describe this dynamics in a model system with a simple
hierarchy of energy gaps $\Delta E_{UV} > \Delta E_{IR}$, in which the coupling
between high-and low-energy degrees of freedom is treated to second order in
perturbation theory. We then describe the equations of motion under suitable
time averaging, reflecting the limited time resolution of actual experiments,

E_{UV}$, after the fashion of effective field theory. The failure of the system
to be Hamiltonian or even Markovian appears at higher orders in this ratio. We
compute the evolution of the density matrix in three specific examples: coupled

with shadows and lighting variations and the presence of other objects in the
scene. Current road detection algorithms characterize road areas at pixel level
and group pixels accordingly. However, these algorithms fail in presence of
strong shadows and lighting variations. Therefore, we propose a road detection
algorithm based on video alignment. The key idea of the algorithm is to exploit
the similarities occurred when a vehicle follows the same trajectory more than
once. In this way, road areas are learned in a first ride and then, this road
knowledge is used to infer areas depicting drivable road surfaces in subsequent
rides. Two different experiments are conducted to validate the proposal on
different video sequences taken at different scenarios and different daytime.
The former aims to perform on-line road detection. The latter aims to perform
off-line road detection and is applied to automatically generate the
ground-truth necessary to validate road detection algorithms. Qualitative and
quantitative evaluations prove that the proposed algorithm is a valid road
detection approach.

neural network (CNN) by incorporating the information from object detection,
focusing on dealing with fine-grained image classification. Unfortunately, CNN
suffers from over-fiting when it is trained on existing fine-grained image
classification benchmarks, which typically only consist of less than a few tens
of thousands training images. Therefore, we first construct a large-scale
fine-grained car recognition dataset that consists of 333 car classes with more
than 150 thousand training images. With this large-scale dataset, we are able
to build a strong baseline for CNN with top-1 classification accuracy of 81.6%.
One major challenge in fine-grained image classification is that many classes
are very similar to each other while having large within-class variation. One
contributing factor to the within-class variation is cluttered image
background. However, the existing CNN training takes uniform window sampling
over the image, acting as blind on the location of the object of interest. In
contrast, this paper proposes an \emph{object-centric sampling} (OCS) scheme
that samples image windows based on the object location information. The
challenge in using the location information lies in how to design powerful
object detector and how to handle the imperfectness of detection results. To
that end, we design a saliency-aware object detection approach specific for the
setting of fine-grained image classification, and the uncertainty of detection
results are naturally handled in our OCS scheme. Our framework is demonstrated
to be very effective, improving top-1 accuracy to 89.3% (from 81.6%) on the
large-scale fine-grained car classification dataset.

asymptotically free gauge theories. First we revisit a simple top-down
holographic model of QCD-like dynamics with predictions in the M_rho-M_pi
plane. The meson masses in this model are in very good agreement with lattice
gauge theory calculations in the quenched approximation. We show that the key
ingredient for the meson mass predictions is the running of the anomalous
dimension of the quark condensate, gamma. This provides an explanation for the
agreement of holographic and quenched lattice gauge theory calculations. We
then study the `Dynamic AdS/QCD model' in which the gauge theory dynamics is
included by a choice for the running of gamma. We use the naive two-loop
perturbative running of the gauge coupling extrapolated to the non-perturbative
regime to estimate the running of gamma across a number of theories. We
consider models with quarks in the fundamental, adjoint, two-index symmetric
and two-index anti-symmetric representations. We display predictions for M_rho,
M_pi, M_sigma and the lightest glueball mass. Many of these theories, where the
contribution to the running of gamma is dominated by the gluons, give very
similar spectra, which also match with lattice expectations for QCD. On the
other hand, a significant difference between spectra in different holographic
models is seen for theories where the quark content changes the gradient of the
running of gamma around the scale at which chiral symmetry breaking is
triggered at gamma approximately 1. For these walking theories we see an
enhancement of the rho-mass and a suppression of the sigma-mass. Both phenomena
are characteristic for walking behaviour in the physical meson masses.

variance of the tumbling rate of axisymmetric particles. It follows that shape
affects the spinning rate in a way that is, on average, complementary to the
shape-dependence of the tumbling rate. We confirm this relationship using
direct numerical simulations, showing how tumbling rate and spinning rate
variances show complementary trends for rod-shaped and disk-shaped particles.

for S0s in different environments using HST/ACS imaging and data from the Space
Telescope A901/2 Galaxy Evolution Survey (STAGES). Using a sample of ~280 field
and cluster S0s, we find that in both environments, ~25 per cent have a pure
exponential disc (Type I) and ~50 per cent exhibit an up-bending disc break
(antitruncation, Type III). However, we find hardly any (< 5 per cent)
down-bending disc breaks (truncations, Type II) in our S0s and many cases (~20
per cent) where no exponential component was observed. We also find no evidence
for an environmental dependence on the disc scalelength or break strength
(outer-to-inner scalelength ratio), implying that the galaxy environment does
not affect the stellar distribution in S0 stellar discs. Comparing disc
structure between these S0s and the spirals from our previous studies, we find:
i) no evidence for the Type I scalelength being dependent on morphology; and
ii) some evidence suggesting the Type II/III break strength is smaller (weaker)
in S0s compared to spirals. Taken together, these results suggest that the
stellar distribution in S0s is not drastically affected by the galaxy
environment. However, some process inherent to the morphological transformation
of spirals into S0s does affect the stellar disc causing a weakening of
{\mu}(r) breaks and may even eliminate truncations from S0s. In further tests,
we perform analytical bulge-disc decompositions on our S0s and compare the
results to those for spirals from our previous studies. For Type III galaxies,
we find that bulge light can account for the excess light at large radii in up
to ~50 per cent of S0s but in only ~15 per cent of spirals. We propose that
this result is consistent with a fading stellar disc (evolving bulge-to-disc
ratio) being an inherent process in the transformation of spirals into S0s.

effect of the flagellar beating on the rheology of a dilute suspension of

Reinhardtii swimming with a breaststroke-like beating of two anterior flagella

unusual angular orbits in a linear shear flow. Namely, the swimmer sustains
orientations transiently across the flow. Such behavior is a result of the
interplay between shear flow and swimmer's periodic beating motion of flagella
which exert internal torques on the cell body. This peculiar behavior has some
significant consequences on the rheological properties of the suspension. We
calculate the Einstein's viscosity of the suspension composed of such isolated
modeled microswimmers (dilute case) in a shear flow. We use numerical
simulations based on a Rotne-Prager like approximation for hydrodynamic
interaction between simplified flagella and the cell body. The results show an

the same matrix integral differently, which gave an interpretation of these

putting one-face maps in bijection with tree-rooted maps, which are orientable

explore the connection between these rook placements and tree-rooted maps by
developing a bijection between these objects. Rook placements on Young diagrams
have a q-analogue due to Garsia and Remmel (1986). In the second part of the

identity which is a q-analogue of part of the Harer-Zagier formula. This

the large-recoil region, we advocate a parameterisation of the hadronic matrix
elements that separates model-independent information about nonperturbative QCD
from the results of model calculations. We clarify how to estimate corrections
to the heavy-quark limit that would generate a right-handed (virtual) photon in
the $b\to s\gamma$ contribution to the decay. We then apply this approach to
the discussion of various sets of observables of increasing theoretical
cleanness. First, we show that angular observables in the optimized
$P_i^{(\prime)}$ basis are, in general, not robust against the long-distance
QCD effects. While a fit to data favours a NP contribution to the semileptonic
operators of the type $\delta C_9\simeq-1.5$, this comes at a relatively small
statistical significance of $\lesssim2 \sigma$, once power corrections are
properly accounted for. Second, two of these observables, $P_1$ and $P_3^{CP}$
are particularly clean at very low $q^2$ and sensitive probes of right-handed
quark currents. We discuss their potential to set stringent bounds on the
Wilson coefficient $C_7^\prime$, especially using data of the electronic mode.
Finally, in light of the recent hint of lepton-universality violation in
$B^+\to K^+\ell\ell$, we introduce and investigate new lepton-universality
observables involving angular observables of the muonic and electronic modes
and their zero crossings, and show that, if the effect is of the size suggested
by experiment, these can clearly distinguish between different NP explanations
in terms of underlying semileptonic operators.

valuation function. We consider the valuation of the items to be correlated,
i.e., desirabilities of the buyer for the items are not drawn independently.
Ideally, the goal is to design a mechanism to maximize the revenue. However, it
has been shown that a revenue optimal mechanism might be very complicated and
as a result inapplicable to real-world auctions. Therefore, our focus is on
designing a simple mechanism that achieves a constant fraction of the optimal
revenue. Babaioff et al. propose a simple mechanism that achieves a constant
fraction of the optimal revenue for independent setting with a single additive
buyer. However, they leave the following problem as an open question: ""Is there
a simple, approximately optimal mechanism for a single additive buyer whose
value for $n$ items is sampled from a common base-value distribution?""
  Babaioff et al. show a constant approximation factor of the optimal revenue
can be achieved by either selling the items separately or as a whole bundle in
the independent setting. We show a similar result for the correlated setting
when the desirabilities of the buyer are drawn from a common base-value
distribution. It is worth mentioning that the core decomposition lemma which is
mainly the heart of the proofs for efficiency of the mechanisms does not hold
for correlated settings. Therefore we propose a modified version of this lemma
which is applicable to the correlated settings as well. Although we apply this
technique to show the proposed mechanism can guarantee a constant fraction of
the optimal revenue in a very weak correlation, this method alone can not
directly show the efficiency of the mechanism in stronger correlations.

equation of state (EOS) is hard sphere without any re-scaling of particle size,
and the hydrodynamic corrections to the long-time self-diffusion coefficient
are quantitatively consistent with the expected value for hard spheres. Care is
taken to ensure that both the dimensionless gravitational energy, which is
equivalent to a Peclet number $Pe_g$, and dipolar strength $\Lambda$ are of
order unity. In the presence of an external electric field, anisotropic
chain-chain clusters form; this cluster formation manifests itself with the
appearance of a plateau in the diffusion coefficient when the dimensionless
dipolar strength $\Lambda \sim 1$. The structure and dynamics of this
chain-chain cluster state is examined for a monodisperse system for two
particle sizes.

constraints on the expected number of transmissions is considered, both for the
discounted and long term average cases. This setup is motivated by applications
where transmission is sporadic and the cost of switching on the radio and
transmitting is significantly more important than the size of the transmitted
data packet. For this model, we characterize the distortion-transmission
function, i.e., the minimum expected distortion that can be achieved when the
expected number of transmissions is less than or equal to a particular value.
In particular, we show that the distortion-transmission function is a piecewise
linear, convex, and decreasing function. We also give an explicit
characterization of each vertex of the piecewise linear function.
  To prove the results, the optimization problem is cast as a decentralized
constrained stochastic control problem. We first consider the Lagrange
relaxation of the constrained problem and identify the structure of optimal
transmission and estimation strategies. In particular, we show that the optimal
transmission is of a threshold type. Using these structural results, we obtain
dynamic programs for the Lagrange relaxations. We identify the performance of
an arbitrary threshold-type transmission strategy and use the idea of
calibration from multi-armed bandits to determine the optimal transmission
strategy for the Lagrange relaxation. Finally, we show that the optimal
strategy for the constrained setup is a randomized strategy that randomizes
between two deterministic strategies that differ only at one state. By
evaluating the performance of these strategies, we determine the shape of the
distortion-transmission function. These results are illustrated using an
example of transmitting a birth-death Markov source.

temperature variability of the charge screening and varies with the crystal
orientation. The anisotropy in the effective mass leads to an anisotropic
carrier mobility, with the mobility in the armchair direction about one order
of magnitude larger than in the zigzag direction. In particular, this mobility
anisotropy is enhanced at low temperatures and high carrier densities. Under
encapsulation with a high-$\kappa$ overlayer, the mobility increases by up to
an order of magnitude although its temperature dependence and its anisotropy
are reduced.

network requires evolution to increase the system rate 1000 times higher than

several studies to integrate mm-wave access into current cellular networks as
multi-band heterogeneous networks to exploit the ultra-wideband aspect of the
mm-wave band. The authors of this paper have proposed comprehensive
architecture of cellular networks with mm-wave access, where mm-wave small cell
basestations and a conventional macro basestation are connected to
Centralized-RAN (C-RAN) to effectively operate the system by enabling power
efficient seamless handover as well as centralized resource control including
dynamic cell structuring to match the limited coverage of mm-wave access with
high traffic user locations via user-plane/control-plane splitting. In this
paper, to prove the effectiveness of the proposed 5G cellular networks with
mm-wave access, system level simulation is conducted by introducing an expected
future traffic model, a measurement based mm-wave propagation model, and a
centralized cell association algorithm by exploiting the C-RAN architecture.
The numerical results show the effectiveness of the proposed network to realize
1000 times higher system rate than the current network in 10 years which is not
achieved by the small cells using commonly considered 3.5 GHz band.
Furthermore, the paper also gives latest status of mm-wave devices and
regulations to show the feasibility of using mm-wave in the 5G systems.

random binary lattice leads to a dramatic enhancement of the high-frequency
phonon transmittance but also increases the low-frequency phonon opacity.
High-frequency semi-extended states are formed while low-frequency modes become
more localized. This results in ballistic heat conduction at finite lengths but
also paradoxically higher thermal resistance that scale as $\sqrt{\Lambda_{m}}$
in the $L\rightarrow\infty$ limit. We identify an emergent crossover length
($L_{c}$) below which the onset of thermal transparency appears. The crossover
length is linearly dependent on but is two orders of magnitude larger than
$\Lambda_{m}$. Our results suggest that the phonon transmittance spectrum and
heat conduction in a disordered 1D lattice can be controlled via statistical
clustering of the constituent component atoms into domains. They also imply
that the detection of ballistic heat conduction in disordered 1D structures may
be a signature of the intrinsic mass correlation at a much smaller length

large VLBI surveys conducted in 2001-2003 (or in 1996 for the 5 GHz sample).
The multi-frequency intrinsic brightness temperatures of the sample of jets are
determined by a statistical method relating the observed brightness
temperatures with the maximal apparent jet speeds, assuming one representative
intrinsic brightness temperature for a sample of jets at each observing
frequency. By investigating the observed brightness temperatures at 15 GHz in
multiple epochs, we found that the determination of the intrinsic brightness
temperature for our sample is affected by the flux density variability of
individual jets at time scales of a few years. This implies that it is
important to use contemporaneous VLBI observations for the multi-frequency
analysis of intrinsic brightness temperatures. Since our analysis is based on
the VLBI observations conducted in 2001-2003, the results are not strongly
affected by the flux density variability. We found that the intrinsic
brightness temperature $T_{\rm 0}$ increases as $T_{\rm 0}\propto\nu_{\rm
obs}^{\xi}$ with $\xi=0.7$ below a critical frequency $\nu_{\rm c}\approx9 {\rm
GHz}$ where energy losses begin to dominate the emission. Above $\nu_{\rm c}$,
$T_{\rm 0}$ decreases with $\xi=-1.2$, supporting for the decelerating jet
model or particle cascade model. We also found that the peak value of $T_{\rm

implying that the VLBI cores observable at 2-86 GHz may be representing jet
regions where the magnetic field energy dominates the total energy in jets.

turbulence for helicity injection at a scale that is much smaller than the
scale of energy injection. In a short range of scales larger than the forcing
scale of magnetic helicity, a bottleneck-like effect appears, which results in
a local reduction of the spectral slope. The slope changes in a domain with a
high level of relative magnetic helicity, which determines that part of the
magnetic energy related to the helical modes at a given scale. If the relative
helicity approaches unity, the spectral slope tends to $-3/2$. We show that
this energy pileup is caused by an inverse cascade of magnetic energy
associated with the magnetic helicity. This negative energy flux is the
contribution of the pure magnetic-to-magnetic energy transfer, which vanishes
in the non-helical limit. In the context of astrophysical dynamos, our results
indicate that a large-scale dynamo can be affected by the magnetic helicity
generated at small scales. The kinetic helicity, in particular, is not involved

quantum dot embedded in a bent carbon nanotube. We establish a model for Pauli
blockade, taking into account the strong g-factor anisotropy that is linked to
the local orientation of the nanotube axis in each quantum dot. We provide a
set of conditions under which our model is approximately mapped to the
spin-blockade model of Jouravlev and Nazarov [O. N. Jouravlev and Y. V.
Nazarov, Phys. Rev. Lett. 96, 176804 (2006)]. The results we obtain for the
magnetic anisotropy of the leakage current, together with their qualitative
geometrical explanation, provide a possible interpretation of previously
unexplained experimental results. Furthermore, we find that in a certain
parameter range, the leakage current becomes highly sensitive to the shape of
the tube, and this sensitivity increases with increasing g-factor anisotropy.
This mutual dependence of the electron transport and the tube shape allows for
mechanical control of the leakage current, and for characterization of the tube
shape via measuring the leakage current.

interaction of vector mesons in which the $f_2(1270)$ resonance appears as a
$\rho$-$\rho$ molecular state in $L=0$ and spin 2. The vector meson dominance,
incorporated in the local hidden gauge approach converts a photon into a
$\rho^0$ meson and the other meson connects the photon with the proton. The
picture is simple and has no free parameters, since the parameters of the
theory have been constrained in the previous study of the vector-vector states.
In a second step we introduce new elements, not present in the local hidden
gauge approach, adapting the $\rho$ propagator to Regge phenomenology and
introducing the $\rho NN$ tensor coupling. We find that both the differential
cross section as well as the $t$ dependence of the cross section are in good
agreement with the experimental results and provide support for the molecular

protoplanetary disk always rebound in mutual collisions, is one of the crucial
steps of planet formation. In the past years, several experiments have been
performed to determine the mass and velocity regimes at which perfect bouncing
does occur and those where there is a chance of the aggregates sticking
together. We conducted a microgravity experiment, which allows us to
investigate free collisions of millimeter-sized SiO2 dust aggregates at the
relevant velocities. We analyzed 52 collisions in detail with velocities of 3.4
mm/s to 6.2 cm/s and found four of them leading to sticking, while the other
aggregates rebounded. Three out of the four sticking collisions occurred at
velocities where previously only bouncing had been predicted. Although the
probability for sticking is low, this opens a new possibility for growth beyond
millimeter sizes. Our setup allowed us to obtain the complete three-dimensional
collision information. Since most previous experiments were interpreted based
on two-dimensional information, we compare our three-dimensional values with
those obtained if only one projection had been available. We find that the
error of a two-dimensional analysis of the collision velocity is very small.
The distribution of the coefficient of restitution in the two-dimensional view
is representative of the real case, but for any given collision its value can
be far off. Impact parameters always have to be analyzed three-dimensionally,
because the two-dimensional values are not meaningful in any way.

star binaries can be used to determine the equation of state of matter at
nuclear density and hence the structure of neutron stars. In particular, after
performing a large number of numerical-relativity simulations of binaries with
nuclear equations of state, we have found that the post-merger emission is
characterized by two distinct and robust spectral features. While the
high-frequency peak was already shown to be associated with the oscillations of
the hypermassive neutron star produced by the merger and to depend on the
equation of state, we have highlighted that the low-frequency peak is related
to the merger process and to the total compactness of the stars in the binary.
This relation is essentially universal and provides a powerful tool to set
tight constraints on the equation of state. We here provide additional
information on the extensive analysis performed, illustrating the methods used,
the tests considered, as well as the robustness of the results. We also discuss
additional relations that can be deduced when exploring the data and how these
correlate with various properties of the binary. Finally, we present a simple
mechanical toy model that explains the main spectral features of the

the system is composed of only generic mixed-signal building blocks. These

magnetic flux in the southern hemisphere is about 10 times stronger than that
in the northern hemisphere during the declining phase of the solar cycle 23 and
during the rising phase of cycle 24, however, this trend reversed. The magnetic
flux becomes about a factor of 4 stronger in the northern hemisphere to that of
southern hemisphere. Additionally, we find that there was significant delay
(about 5 months) in change of the polarity in the southern hemisphere in
comparison with the northern hemisphere. These results provide us with hints of
how the toroidal fluxes have contributed to the solar dynamo during the
prolonged minima in the solar cycle 23 and in the rising phase of the solar
cycle 24. Using a solar flux-transport dynamo model, we demonstrate that
persistently stronger sunspot cycles in one hemisphere could be caused by the
effect of greater inflows into active region belts in that hemisphere.
Observations indicate that greater inflows are associated with stronger
activity. Some other change or difference in meridional circulation between

asymptotic behavior of the root mean square displacement in different
geometries, considering even cases of steep variations of the channel

the various corrections proposed in the literature to the well known

properties of these pili have been considered important for the ability of
bacteria to withstand shear forces from rinsing urine flows. Force measuring
optical tweezers have been used to characterize individual organelles of F1C
type expressed by UPEC bacteria with respect to such properties. Qualitatively,
the force-vs.-elongation response was found to be similar to that of other
types of helix-like pili expressed by UPEC, i.e. type 1, P, and S, with
force-induced elongation in three regions of which one represents the important
uncoiling mechanism of the helix-like quaternary structure. Quantitatively, the
steady-state uncoiling force was assessed to 26.4(1.4) pN, which is similar to
those of other pili (which range from 21 pN for SI to 30 pN for type 1). The
corner velocity for dynamic response (1400 nm/s) was found to be larger than
those of the other pili (400 -700 nm/s for S and P pili, and 6 nm/s for type
1). The kinetics were found to be faster, with a thermal opening rate of 17 Hz,
a few times higher than S and P pili, and three orders of magnitude times
higher than type 1. These data suggest that F1C pili are, like P and S pili,
evolutionary-selected to primarily withstand the conditions expressed in the

multi-wavelength observations identified the system as new Be/X-ray binary
system in the Small Magellanic Cloud. Follow-up X-ray observations by Swift and
XMM-Newton revealed an X-ray pulse period of 5.05s and that the system
underwent regular occulation/eclipse behaviour every 17d. This is the first
reported eclipsing Be/X-ray binary system in the SMC, and only the second such
system known to date. Furthermore, the nature of the occultation makes it
possible to use the neutron star to X-ray the circumstellar disk, thereby, for
the first time, revealing direct observational evidence for its size and clumpy
structure. Swift timing measurements allowed for the binary solution to be
calculated from the Doppler shifted X-ray pulsations. This solution suggests
this is a low eccentricity binary relative to others measured in the SMC.

that inferred from the spectroscopic classification of B0.2Ve (approx 16 solar

current densities for a massive fermionic field with nonzero chemical
potential, $\mu$, in the geometry of a straight cosmic string with a magnetic
flux running along its axis. These densities are decomposed into the vacuum
expectation values and contributions coming from the particles and
antiparticles. The charge density is an even periodic function of the magnetic
flux with the period equal to the quantum flux and an odd function of the
chemical potential. The only nonzero component of the current density
corresponds to the azimuthal current. The latter is an odd periodic function of
the magnetic flux and an even function of the chemical potential. At high
temperatures, the parts in the charge density and azimuthal current induced by
the planar angle deficit and magnetic flux are exponentially small. The
asymptotic behavior at low temperatures crucially depends whether the value
$|\mu|$ is larger or smaller than the mass of the field quanta, $m$. For
$|\mu|<m$ the charge density and the contributions into the azimuthal current
coming from the particles and antiparticles are exponentially suppressed at low
temperatures. In the case $|\mu|>m$, the charge and current densities receive
two contributions coming from the vacuum expectation values and from particles
or antiparticles (depending on the sign of chemical potential). At large
distances from the string the latter exhibits a damping oscillatory behavior
with the amplitude inversely proportional to the square of the distance.

Standard Model (SM), that is weakly interacting. This is an exceptional feature
not generally true if new physics exists beyond the mass gap found at the LHC
up to 700 GeV.
  Any such new physics would induce departures from the SM in the low-energy
dynamics for the minimal electroweak symmetry-breaking sector (EWSBS), with
three Goldstone bosons (related to longitudinal W and Z bosons) and one light
Higgs-like scalar.
  With no new particle content, for most of the parameter space, the scattering
is actually strongly interacting (with the SM a remarkable exception). We
therefore explore various unitarization methods, that have already be applied
to the tree-level WL WL amplitude; we find and study a natural second
sigma-like scalar pole there. Of note is its appearance due to either elastic

unconstrained by current LHC data and could be large.

even if we require compliance with Lorentz invariance. Instead of a wave
equation, the dynamics may satisfy a local algebraic relation involving the
permittivity and the properties of the electromagnetic field, in analogy with
more conventional dielectric (but still preserving Lorentz invariance). We
develop the formalism for such theories and investigate some phenomenological
implications. The problem of the divergence of the classical self-energy can be
solved, or at least softened, in this framework. Some interesting new
cosmological solutions for the very early universe are found, including the
possibility of a bounce, inflation and expansion with a loitering phase, all of

superoxide to give H(2)O(2). Recently, the mutation of the Glu47 residue into
alanine (E47A) in the active site of SOR from Desulfoarculus baarsii has
allowed the stabilization of an iron-peroxo species when quickly reacted with
H(2)O(2) [Math{\'e} et al. (2002) J. Am. Chem. Soc. 124, 4966-4967]. To further
investigate this non-heme peroxo-iron species, we have carried out a
M{\""o}ssbauer study of the (57)Fe-enriched E47A SOR from D. baarsii reacted
quickly with H(2)O(2). Considering the M{\""o}ssbauer data, we conclude, in
conjunction with the other spectroscopic data available and with the results of
density functional calculations on related models, that this species
corresponds to a high-spin side-on peroxo-Fe(3+) complex. This is one of the
first examples of such a species in a biological system for which M{\""o}ssbauer
parameters are now available: delta(/Fe) = 0.54 (1) mm/s, DeltaE(Q) = -0.80 (5)
mm/s, and the asymmetry parameter eta = 0.60 (5) mm/s. The M{\""o}ssbauer and
spin Hamiltonian parameters have been evaluated on a model from the side-on
peroxo complex (model 2) issued from the oxidized iron center in SOR from
Pyrococcus furiosus, for which structural data are available in the literature
[Yeh et al. (2000) Biochemistry 39, 2499-2508]. For comparison, similar
calculations have been carried out on a model derived from 2 (model 3), where
the [CH(3)-S](1)(-) group has been replaced by the neutral [NH(3)](0) group
[Neese and Solomon (1998) J. Am. Chem. Soc. 120, 12829-12848]. Both models 2
and 3 contain a formally high-spin Fe(3+) ion (i.e., with empty minority spin
orbitals). We found, however, a significant fraction (approximately 0.6 for 2,
approximately 0.8 for 3) of spin (equivalently charge) spread over two occupied
(minority spin) orbitals. The quadrupole splitting value for 2 is found to be
negative and matches quite well the experimental value. The computed quadrupole
tensors are rhombic in the case of 2 and axial in the case of 3. This
difference originates directly from the presence of the thiolate ligand in 2. A
correlation between experimental isomer shifts for Fe(3+) mononuclear complexes
with computed electron densities at the iron nucleus has been built and used to
evaluate the isomer shift values for 2 and 3 (0.56 and 0.63 mm/s,
respectively). A significant increase of isomer shift value is found upon going
from a methylthiolate to a nitrogen ligand for the Fe(3+) ion, consistent with
covalency effects due to the presence of the axial thiolate ligand. Considering
that the isomer shift value for 3 is likely to be in the 0.61-0.65 mm/s range
[Horner et al. (2002) Eur. J. Inorg. Chem., 3278-3283], the isomer shift value
for a high-spin eta(2)-O(2) Fe(3+) complex with an axial thiolate group can be
estimated to be in the 0.54-0.58 mm/s range. The occurrence of a side-on peroxo
intermediate in SOR is discussed in relation to the recent data published for a
side-on peroxo-Fe(3+) species in another biological system [Karlsson et al.
(2003) Science 299, 1039-1042].

cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropy data is one of the most active
areas in cosmology. WMAP, Planck and other recent experiments have shown that
the six parameters standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmological model still best fits the
data. Bayesian methods based on Markov-Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling have
been playing leading role in parameter estimation from CMB data. In one of the
recent studies \cite{2012PhRvD..85l3008P} we have shown that particle swarm
optimization (PSO) which is a population based search procedure can also be
effectively used to find the cosmological parameters which are best fit to the
WMAP seven year data. In the present work we show that PSO not only can find
the best-fit point, it can also sample the parameter space quite effectively,
to the extent that we can use the same analysis pipeline to process PSO sampled

consistent results. We also present implementations of downhill-simplex Method
of Nelder and Mead and Powell's method of Bound Optimization BY Quadratic

systems. First, we study the stability of periodic motion when the phase shift
between the external force and the oscillation is controlled -contrary to the
standard case, where the control parameter is the frequency of the force.
Phase-shift control is the operational configuration under which self-sustained
oscillators -and, in particular, micromechanical oscillators- provide a
frequency reference useful for time keeping. We show that, contrary to the
standard forced Duffing oscillator, under phase-shift control oscillations are
stable over the whole resonance curve. Second, we analyze a model for the
internal resonance between the main Duffing oscillation mode and a
higher-harmonic mode of a vibrating solid bar clamped at its two ends. We focus
on the stabilization of the oscillation frequency when the resonance takes
place, and present preliminary experimental results that illustrate the
phenomenon. This synchronization process has been proposed to counteract the
undesirable frequency-amplitude interdependence in nonlinear time-keeping
micromechanical devices.

models, energy relaxation of the hot electrons in the quasi-two-dimensional
channel of lattice-matched InAlN/AlN/GaN heterostructures is studied
theoretically. The electron power dissipation and energy relaxation time due to
both half-space and interface phonons are calculated as functions of the
electron temperature $T_e$ using a variety of phonon lifetime values from
experiment, and then compared with those evaluated by the 3DP model. The 3DP
model yields very close results to the DC model: with no hot phonons or
screening the power loss calculated from the 3DP model is 5% smaller than the
DC power dissipation, whereas slightly larger 3DP power loss (by less than 4%
with a phonon lifetime from 0.1 to 1 ps) is obtained throughout the electron
temperature range from room temperature to 2500 K after including both the
hot-phonon effect (HPE) and screening. Very close results are obtained also for
energy relaxation time with the two phonon models (within a 5% of deviation).
However the 3DP model is found to underestimate the HPE by 9%. The Mori-Ando
sum rule is restored by which it is proved that the power dissipation values
obtained from the DC and 3DP models are in general different in the pure phonon
emission process, except when scattering with interface phonons is sufficiently
weak, or when the degenerate modes condition is imposed, which is also
consistent with Register's scattering rate sum rule. Our calculation with both
phonon models has obtained a great fall in energy relaxation time at low
electron temperatures ($T_e<$ 750 K) and slow decrease at the high
temperatures. The calculated temperature dependence of the relaxation time and
the high-temperature relaxation time $\sim$0.09 ps are in good agreement with

fragmentation, but reduces both the number of clumps and the duration of the
unstable phase. Once formed, bound clumps cannot be destroyed by our feedback
model. Widespread fragmentation is promoted by high gas fractions and low halo
concentrations. Yet giant clumps $M > 10^8 M_{\odot}$ lasting several hundred
Myr are rare and mainly produced by clump-clump mergers. They occur in massive
discs with maximum rotational velocities $V_{max} > 250$ km/s at $z \sim 2$, at
the high mass end of the observed galaxy population at those redshifts. The
typical gaseous and stellar masses of clumps in all runs are in the range $\sim
10^7-10^8 M_{\odot}$ for galaxies with disc mass in the range $10^{10}-8\times

agreement with recent clump observations in lensed high-z galaxies. \\ We argue
that many of the giant clumps identified in observations are not due to in-situ
fragmetation, or are the result of blending of smaller structures owing to
insufficient resolution. Using an analytical model describing local collapse

reduced two-photon photoluminescence (TPPL) due to the ultrasmooth surface.
Both linear scattering and non-linear TPPL are studied in detail. The nanoslit
arrays show clear Fano-like resonance and the nanoholes are found to support
both photonic modes and localized surface plasmonic resonance. We also found
that TPPL generation is more efficient when the excitation polarization is
parallel rather than perpendicular to the edge of the aluminum film. Such
counter-intuitive phenomenon is attributed to the high refractive index of the
GaAs substrate. We show that the polarization of TPPL from aluminum well
preserves the excitation polarization and is independent of the crystal
orientation of the film or substrate. Our study gains insight into the optical
property of aluminum nanostructures on high-index semiconducting GaAs substrate

method along with the Yang-Baxter equation which is the key relation in this
systematic approach to study integrable models. Our main interest concerns
rational integrable spin chains and lattice models. We recall the relation
among them and how they can be solved using Bethe ansatz methods incorporating
so-called Q-functions. In order to remind the reader how the Yangian emerges in
this context, an overview of its so-called RTT-realization is provided. The
main part is based on the author's original publications. Firstly, we construct
Q-operators whose eigenvalues yield the Q-functions for rational homogeneous
spin chains. The Q-operators are introduced as traces over certain monodromies
of R-operators. Our construction allows us to derive the hierarchy of commuting
Q-operators and the functional relations among them. We study how the
nearest-neighbor Hamiltonian and in principle also higher local charges can be
extracted from the Q-operators directly. Secondly, we formulate the Yangian
invariance condition, also studied in relation to scattering amplitudes of N=4
super Yang-Mills theory, in the RTT-realization. We find that Yangian
invariants can be interpreted as special eigenvectors of certain inhomogeneous
spin chains. This allows us to apply the algebraic Bethe ansatz and derive the
corresponding Bethe equations that are relevant to construct the invariants. We
examine the connection between the Yangian invariant spin chain eigenstates
whose components can be understood as partition functions of certain 2d lattice
models and tree-level scattering amplitudes of the four-dimensional gauge
theory. Finally, we conclude and discuss some future directions.

Usually a
minimum value of the Lorentz factor of the relativistic bulk motion is obtained
based on the argument that the observed high energy photons ($\gg {\rm MeV}$)
can escape without suffering from absorption due to pair production. The exact
value, rather than a lower limit, of the Lorentz factor can be obtained if the
spectral cutoff due to such absorption is detected. With the good spectral
coverage of the Large Area Telescope (LAT) on \textsl{Fermi}, measurements of
such cutoff become possible, and two cases (GRB~090926A and GRB~100724B) have
been reported to have high-energy cutoffs or breaks. We systematically search
for such high energy spectral cutoffs/breaks from the LAT and the Gamma-ray
burst monitor (GBM) observations of the prompt emission of GRBs detected since
August 2011. Six more GRBs are found to have cutoff-like spectral feature at
energies of $\sim10-500$~MeV. Assuming that these cutoffs are caused by
pair-production absorption within the source, the bulk Lorentz factors of these
GRBs are obtained. We further find that the Lorentz factors are correlated with
the isotropic gamma-ray luminosity of the bursts, indicating that more powerful
GRB jets move faster.

where the pole-like singularities of the corresponding quark propagator
influence the solution of the BS equation and develop a framework within which

$\mu=\pm 1$. We obtain an analytical expression for $p(s)$, and use this result

Casimir energy which make it convenient to analyze the divergence problem or to
yield the Casimir force. The Casimir pressure contribution of parallel waves
(with wave vector parallel to the Casimir plates) together with the
non-commutativity of limit and summation operators, are discussed and found to
be useful for understanding the inhomogeneous divergence declared in another
paper [Phys. Rev. A 87, 043806 (2013)]. We should emphasize that we cannot yet
give an exact expression of inhomogeneous Casimir pressure beyond first-order
perturbation, which is worth future investigation.
