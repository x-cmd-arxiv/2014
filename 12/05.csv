distribution may naturally be considered an infinite dimensional nuisance
parameter. Thus, the semiparametric method may be tried, which is to compute
the scores function for the main parameter minus its orthogonal projection on
the closed linear tangent space for the nuisance parameter, and then rescale
for Fisher consistency. In this paper, we derive such a semiparametric
influence curve by nonlinear projection on the tangent balls arising in robust
statistics.
  This semiparametric influence curve is then compared with the optimally
robust influence curve that minimizes maximum weighted mean square error of the
corresponding asymptotically linear estimators over infinitesimal
neighborhoods. For Hellinger balls, the two coincide (with the classical one).
In the total variation model, the semiparametric IC solves the robust MSE
problem for a particular bias weight. In the case of contamination
neighborhoods, the semiparametric IC is bounded only from above. Due to an
interchange of truncation and linear combination, the discrepancy increases
with the dimension.
  While there is coincidence for Hellinger balls, at least clipping is achieved
for total variation and contamination neighborhoods, but the semiparametric
method in general falls short to solve the minimax MSE estimation problem for
the gross error models.
  The semiparametric approach is carried further to testing contaminated
hypotheses. In the one-sided case, for testing hypotheses defined by any two
closed convex sets of tangents, a saddle point is furnished by projection on
the set of differences of these sets. For total variation and contamination
neighborhoods, we thus recover the robust asymptotic tests based on least
favorable pairs. So the two approaches agree in the testing context.

sensory stimuli. After training, a brief cue can trigger a spatiotemporal
pattern of neural activity similar to that evoked by a learned stimulus
sequence. Network models show that such sequence learning can occur through the
shaping of feedforward excitatory connectivity via long term plasticity.
Previous models describe how event order can be learned, but they typically do
not explain how precise timing can be recalled. We propose a mechanism for
learning both the order and precise timing of event sequences. In our recurrent
network model, long term plasticity leads to the learning of the sequence,
while short term facilitation enables temporally precise replay of events.
Learned synaptic weights between populations determine the time necessary for
one population to activate another. Long term plasticity adjusts these weights
so that the trained event times are matched during playback. While we chose
short term facilitation as a time-tracking process, we also demonstrate that
other mechanisms, such as spike rate adaptation, can fulfill this role. We also
analyze the impact of trial-to-trial variability, showing how observational
errors as well as neuronal noise result in variability in learned event times.
The dynamics of the playback process determine how stochasticity is inherited
in learned sequence timings. Future experiments that characterize such
variability can therefore shed light on the neural mechanisms of sequence
learning.

complexity and a long-standing debate in quantum foundation concerning the

mathematical object containing statistical information about the outcome of
measurements as interpreted by Born? Although these questions sound
philosophical and pointless, they can be made precise in the framework of what
we call classical theories of quantum processes, which are a reword of quantum
phenomena in the language of classical probability theory. In 2012, Pusey,
Barrett and Rudolph (PBR) proved, under an assumption of preparation
independence, a theorem supporting the original interpretation of Schrodinger
in the classical framework. Recently, we showed that these questions are
related to a practical problem in quantum communication complexity, namely,
quantifying the minimal amount of classical communication required in the
classical simulation of a two-party quantum communication process. In
particular, we argued that the statement of the PBR theorem can be proved if
the classical communication cost of simulating the communication of n qubits
grows more than exponentially in 'n'. Our argument is based on an assumption
that we call probability equipartition property. This property is somehow
weaker than the preparation independence property used in the PBR theorem, as
the former can be justified by the latter and the asymptotic equipartition
property of independent stochastic sources. The equipartition property is a
general and natural hypothesis that can be assumed even if the preparation
independence hypothesis is dropped. In this review, we further develop our
argument into the form of a theorem.

usefulness of this framework by delineating three distinct types of helping
traits (""whole-group"", ""nonexpresser-only"" and ""expresser-only""), which are
characterized by different synergies of kind (arising from differential fitness
effects on individuals expressing or not expressing helping) and can be
subjected to different synergies of scale (arising from economies or
diseconomies of scale). We find that relatedness and synergies of kind and
scale can interact to generate nontrivial evolutionary dynamics, such as cases
of bistable coexistence featuring both a stable equilibrium with a positive
level of helping and an unstable helping threshold. This broadens the
qualitative effects of relatedness (or spatial structure) on the evolution of
helping.

Survey sample and the Kepler sample, we investigate the causes for the
difference of HJ occurrence rate. First, we find that $12.8\%\pm0.24\%$ of HJs
are misidentified in the Kepler mission because of photometric dilution and
subgiant contamination. Second, we explore the differences between the Doppler
sample and the Kepler sample that can account for the different HJ occurrence
rate. Third, we discuss how to measure the fundamental HJ occurrence rates by
synthesizing the results from the Doppler and Kepler surveys. The fundamental
HJ occurrence rates are a measure of HJ occurrence rate as a function of
stellar multiplicity and evolutionary stage, e.g., the HJ occurrence rate for
single and multiple stars or for main sequence and subgiant stars. While we
find qualitative evidence that HJs occur less frequently in subgiants and
multiple stellar systems, we conclude that our current knowledge of stellar
properties and stellar multiplicity rate is too limited for us to reach any
quantitative result for the fundamental HJ occurrence rates. This concern
extends to $\eta_{\rm{Earth}}$, the occurrence rate of Earth-like planets.

substantially improve the image quality of low-dose X-ray computed tomography
(CT) as compared to the conventional filtered back-projection (FBP) method for
various clinical tasks. According to the maximum a posterior (MAP) estimation,
the SIR methods can be typically formulated by an objective function consisting
of two terms: (1) data-fidelity (or equivalently, data-fitting or
data-mismatch) term modeling the statistics of projection measurements, and (2)
regularization (or equivalently, prior or penalty) term reflecting prior
knowledge or expectation on the characteristics of the image to be
reconstructed. Existing SIR methods for low-dose CT can be divided into two
groups: (1) those that use calibrated transmitted photon counts (before
log-transform) with penalized maximum likelihood (pML) criterion, and (2) those
that use calibrated line-integrals (after log-transform) with penalized
weighted least-squares (PWLS) criterion. Accurate statistical modeling of the
projection measurements is a prerequisite for SIR, while the regularization
term in the objective function also plays a critical role for successful image
reconstruction. This paper reviews several statistical models on CT projection
measurements and various regularization strategies incorporating prior
knowledge or expected properties of the image to be reconstructed, which
together formulate the objective function of the SIR methods for low-dose X-ray
CT.

we can generate a matrix of bootstrap weights and compute the entire vector of

particularly important for matrix-oriented programming languages such as R,

while approximately matching the test error of kNN classification on the full
training set. In fact, because the compressed set is learned in a supervised
fashion, it sometimes even outperforms the full data set, while requiring only
a fraction of the space and drastically reducing test-time computation.

has remained a controversial subject for long. While some explanations of such
non-normal transient growth of disturbances in the Rayleigh stable limit were
available for magnetized accretion flows, similar instabilities in absence of
magnetic perturbations remained unexplained. This dichotomy was resolved in two
recent publications by Chattopadhyay, {\it et al} where it was shown that such
instabilities, especially for non-magnetized accretion flows, were introduced
through interaction of the inherent stochastic noise in the system (even a
\enquote{cold} accretion flow at 3000K is too \enquote{hot} in the statistical
parlance and is capable of inducing strong thermal modes) with the underlying
Taylor-Couette flow profiles. Both studies, however, excluded the additional
energy influx (or efflux) that could result from nonzero cross-correlation of a
noise perturbing the velocity flow, say, with the noise that is driving the
vorticity flow (or equivalently the magnetic field and magnetic vorticity flow
dynamics). In this article we show that nonzero noise cross-correlations
essentially renormalize the strength of temporal correlations. Apart from an
overall boost in the energy rate (both for spatial and temporal correlations,
and hence in the ensemble averaged energy spectra), this results in mutual
competition in growth rates of affected variables often resulting in
suppression of oscillating Alfven waves at small times while leading to faster
saturations at relatively longer time scales. The effects are seen to be more
pronounced with magnetic field fluxes where the noise cross-correlation
magnifies the strength of the field concerned.

surface-mounted rotating disc actuators is investigated numerically. The wall
arrangement of the discs has a complex and unexpected effect on the flow. For
low disc-tip velocities, the drag reduction scales linearly with the percentage
of the actuated area, whereas for higher disc-tip velocity the drag reduction
can be larger than the prediction found through the linear scaling with
actuated area. For medium disc-tip velocities, all the cases which display this
additional drag reduction exhibit stationary-wall regions between discs along
the streamwise direction. This effect is caused by the viscous boundary layer
which develops over the portions of stationary wall due to the radial flow
produced by the discs. For the highest disc-tip velocity, the drag reduction
even increases by halving the number of discs. The power spent to activate the
discs is instead independent of the disc arrangement and scales linearly with
the actuated area for all disc-tip velocities. The Fukagata-Iwamoto-Kasagi
identity and flow visualizations are employed to provide further insight into
the dynamics of the streamwise-elongated structures appearing between discs.
Sufficient interaction between adjacent discs along the spanwise direction must
occur for the structures to be created at the disc side where the wall velocity
is directed in the opposite direction to the streamwise mean flow. Novel
half-disc and annular actuators are investigated to improve the disc-flow
performance, resulting in a maximum of 26\% drag reduction.

with a stereotyped waveform, varying solely the interval between pulses
according to the information being transmitted. This simple codification
mechanism is similar to the one found in various known neuronal circuits, which
renders these animals as good models for the study of natural communication
systems, allowing experiments involving behavioral and neuroethological
aspects. Performing analysis of data collected from more than one freely
swimming fish is a challenge since the detected electric organ discharge (EOD)
patterns are dependent on each animal's position and orientation relative to
the electrodes. However, since each fish emits a characteristic EOD waveform,
computational tools can be employed to match each EOD to the respective fish.
In this paper we describe a computational method able to recognize fish EODs
from dyads using normalized feature vectors obtained by applying Fourier and
dual-tree complex wavelet packet transforms. We employ support vector machines
as classifiers, and a continuity constraint algorithm allows us to solve issues
caused by overlapping EODs and signal saturation. Extensive validation
procedures with Gymnotus sp. showed that EODs can be assigned correctly to each
fish with only two errors per million discharges.

missions because the coolest stars could provide habitable conditions for up to
2.5 billion years post-accretion. Moreover, for a given star type, planetary
systems are more easily resolved because of higher pre-main-sequence stellar
luminosities, resulting in larger planet to star separation for cool stars than
is the case for the traditional main-sequence (MS) habitable zone (HZ). We use
1D radiative-convective climate and stellar evolutionary models to calculate
pre-main-sequence HZ distances for F1 to M8 stellar types. We also show that
accreting planets that are later located in the traditional MS HZ orbiting
stars cooler than a K5 (including the full range of M-stars) receive stellar
fluxes that exceed the runaway greenhouse threshold, and thus may lose
substantial amounts of water initially delivered to them. We predict that
M-star planets need to initially accrete more water than Earth did or,
alternatively, have additional water delivered later during the long

The Beer index of convexity $\operatorname{b}(S)$ of $S$ is the probability
that two points of $S$ chosen uniformly independently at random see each other
in $S$. The convexity ratio $\operatorname{c}(S)$ of $S$ is the Lebesgue
measure of the largest convex subset of $S$ divided by the Lebesgue measure of

convexity.
  We show that every set $S\subseteq\mathbb{R}^2$ with simply connected

absolute constant $\alpha$, provided $\operatorname{b}(S)$ is defined. This
implies an affirmative answer to the conjecture of Cabello et al. that this
estimate holds for simple polygons.
  We also consider higher-order generalizations of $\operatorname{b}(S)$. For
$1\leq k\leq d$, the $k$-index of convexity $\operatorname{b}_k(S)$ of a set

$\operatorname{b}_d(S)$ exists. We provide an almost matching lower bound by
showing that there is a constant $\gamma(d)>0$ such that for every

monitoring could become widely accessible and transparent to users. We
demonstrate how one could take advantage of this situation to increase users'
engagement and enhance user experience in human-agent interaction. We created
an experimental protocol involving embodied agents -- ""virtual avatars"". Those
agents were displayed alongside a beating heart. We compared a condition in
which this feedback was simply duplicating the heart rates of users to another
condition in which it was set to an average heart rate. Results suggest a
superior social presence of agents when they display feedback similar to users'

with little effort, to a better acceptance of agents and robots by the general

orbital grouping including the largest Trojan, Eureka. In order to test if this
could be a genetic family, we simulated the long term evolution of a tight
orbital cluster centered on Eureka. We explored two cases: cluster dispersal
through planetary gravity alone over 1 Gyr, and a 1 Gyr evolution due to both
gravity and the Yarkovsky effect. We find that the dispersal of the cluster in
eccentricity is primarily due to dynamical chaos, while the inclinations and
libration amplitudes are primarily changed by the Yarkovsky effect. Current
distribution of the cluster members orbits are indicative of an initially tight
orbital grouping that was affected by a negative acceleration (i.e. one against
the orbital motion) consistent with the thermal Yarkovsky effect. We conclude
that the cluster is a genetic family formed either in a collision or through
multiple rotational fissions. The cluster's age is on the order of 1 Gyr, and
its long-term orbital evolution is likely dominated by the seasonal, rather
than diurnal, Yarkovsky effect. If confirmed, Gyr-scale dominance of the
seasonal Yarkovsky effect may indicate suppression of the diurnal Yarkovsky
drift by the related YORP effect. Further study of Mars Trojans is essential
for understanding the long-term orbital and rotational dynamics of small bodies

Conveniently, these invariants are always Abelian phases, even if the gauge

from its surrounding environment or inevitable leakage due to its contact with

proposed for quantum memory or storage. Among them, the fast-signal control or
dynamical decoupling based on external pulse sequences provides a prevailing
strategy aimed at suppressing decoherence and preventing the target systems
from the leakage or diffusion process. In this paper, we review the
applications of this protocol in protecting quantum memory under the
non-Markovian dissipative noise and maintaining systems on finite speed
adiabatic passages without leakage there-from. We analyze leakage and control
perturbative and nonperturbative dynamical equations including second-order
master equation, quantum-state-diffusion equation, and one-component master
equation derived from Feshbach PQ-partitioning technique. It turns out that the
quality of fast-modulated signal control is insensitive to configurations of
the applied pulse sequences. Specifically, decoherence and leakage will be
greatly suppressed as long as the control sequence is able to effectively shift
the system beyond the bath cutoff frequency, almost independent of the details
of the control sequences which could be ideal pulses, regular rectangular
pulses, random pulses and even noisy pulses.

of FSMs that corresponds to the possibility of detecting if the current state
of an FSM belongs to a set of critical states modeling operations that may be
unsafe or, in general, operations of specific interest in a particular
application. A critical observer is an observer that detects on-line the
occurrence of critical states. When a large-scale network of FSMs is
considered, the construction of such an observer is prohibitive because of the
large computational effort needed. In this paper we propose a decentralized
architecture for critical observers of networks of FSMs, where on-line
detection of critical states is performed by local critical observers, each
associated with an FSM of the network. For the efficient design of
decentralized critical observers we first extend on-the-fly algorithms
traditionally used in the community of formal methods for the formal
verification and control design of FSMs. We then extend to networks of FSMs,
bisimulation theory traditionally given in the community of formal methods for
single FSMs. The proposed techniques provide a remarkable computational
complexity reduction, as discussed throughout the paper and also demonstrated
by means of illustrative examples. Finally, we propose an example in the
context of biological networks, which illustrates the applicability of our
results and also the interest arising from concrete application domains.

theory (MLT) is presented for the lower part of the convection zone in
pure-hydrogen atmosphere white dwarfs. The parameterization is performed from a
comparison of 3D CO5BOLD simulations with a grid of 1D envelopes with a varying
mixing-length parameter. In many instances, the 3D simulations are restricted
to the upper part of the convection zone. The hydrodynamical calculations
suggest, in those cases, that the entropy of the upflows does not change
significantly from the bottom of the convection zone to regions immediately
below the photosphere. We rely on this asymptotic entropy value, characteristic
of the deep and adiabatically stratified layers, to calibrate 1D envelopes. The
calibration encompasses the convective hydrogen-line (DA) white dwarfs in the
effective temperature range 6000 < Teff (K) < 15,000 and the surface gravity
range 7.0 < log g < 9.0. It is established that the local MLT is unable to
reproduce simultaneously the thermodynamical, flux, and dynamical properties of
the 3D simulations. We therefore propose three different parameterizations for
these quantities. The resulting calibration can be applied to structure and
envelope calculations, in particular for pulsation, chemical diffusion, and
convective mixing studies. On the other hand, convection has no effect on the
white dwarf cooling rates until there is a convective coupling with the
degenerate core below Teff ~ 5000 K. In this regime, the 1D structures are
insensitive to the MLT parameterization and converge to the mean 3D results,
hence remain fully appropriate for age determinations.

and topology. It has been shown to be NP-hard by [Thomassen '89] and a
linear-time fixed-parameter algorithm has been obtained by [Mohar '99]. Despite
extensive study, the approximability of the Euler genus remains wide open.
While the existence of an $O(1)$-approximation is not ruled out, the currently
best-known upper bound is a trivial $O(n/g)$-approximation that follows from
bounds on the Euler characteristic.
  In this paper, we give the first non-trivial approximation algorithm for this
problem. Specifically, we present a polynomial-time algorithm which given a
graph $G$ of Euler genus $g$ outputs an embedding of $G$ into a surface of
Euler genus $g^{O(1)}$. Combined with the above $O(n/g)$-approximation, our
result also implies a $O(n^{1-\alpha})$-approximation, for some universal
constant $\alpha>0$.
  Our approximation algorithm also has implications for the design of
algorithms on graphs of small genus. Several of these algorithms require that
an embedding of the graph into a surface of small genus is given as part of the

to the presence of a U(1) in the U(N) isotropy group, which introduces a
soft-graviton singularity that obscures the action of the duality symmetry. In
this paper, we introduce an anti-symmetrised extraction procedure that exposes
the full duality group. We illustrate this procedure for tree-level amplitudes
in 4<=N<8 supergravity in four dimensions, as well as N=16 supergravity in
three dimensions. In three dimensions, as all bosonic degrees of freedom
transform under the E8 duality group, supersymmetry ensures that the amplitude
vanishes in the single-soft limit of all particle species, in contrast to its
higher dimensional siblings. Using recursive formulas and generalized unitarity
cuts in three dimensions, we demonstrate the action of the duality group for
any tree-level and one-loop amplitudes. Finally we discuss the implications of
the duality symmetry on possible counter terms for this theory. As a
preliminary application, we show that the vanishing of single-soft limits of
arbitrary component fields in three-dimensional supergravity rules out the
direct dimensional reduction of D^8R^4 as a valid counter term.

density can induce slow adjustments of the moduli, changing the modulations. We

A non-drifting template suffices over a wide range of parameters, but for the
highest frequencies of interest, or for sufficiently strong drift, it is
necessary to include parameters characterizing the change in frequency over the

radiation over a broad spectral range and a wide range of heights. In
particular, line emission from the chromosphere can provide critical
diagnostics of plasma heating processes. Thus, a direct comparison between
high-resolution spectroscopic observations and advanced numerical modeling
results could be extremely valuable, but has not yet been attempted. In this
paper, we present in this paper such a self-consistent investigation of an M3.0
flare observed by the Dunn Solar Telescope's Interferometric Bi-dimensional
Spectrometer (IBIS) on 2011 September 24 which we have modeled with the
radiative hydrodynamic code RADYN. We obtained images and spectra of the
flaring region with IBIS in H$\alpha$ 6563 \AA\ and Ca II 8542 \AA, and with
the Reuven Ramaty High Energy Solar Spectroscope Imager (RHESSI) in X-rays. The
latter observations were used to infer the non-thermal electron population,
which was passed to RADYN to simulate the atmospheric response to electron
collisional heating. We then synthesized spectral lines and compared their
shapes and intensities to those observed by IBIS and found a general agreement.
In particular, the synthetic Ca II 8542 \AA\ profile fits well to the observed
profile, while the synthetic H$\alpha$ profile is fainter in the core than for
the observation. This indicates that H$\alpha$ emission is more responsive to
the non-thermal electron flux than the Ca II 8542 \AA\ emission. We suggest
that it is necessary to refine the energy input and other processes is
necessary to resolve this discrepancy.

field equations on November 25, 1915, but six days earlier, on November 20,
Hilbert had derived the identical field equations for which Einstein had been
searching such a long time. On November 18 Hilbert had sent Einstein a letter
with a certain draft, and F\""olsing asked about this possible draft: ""Could
Einstein, casting his eye over this paper, have discovered the term which was
still lacking in his own equations, and thus 'nostrified' Hilbert?"" Historical
evidence support a scenario according to which Einstein discovered his final
field equations by ""casting his eye over"" his own previous works. In November
4, 1915 Einstein wrote the components of the gravitational field and showed
that a material point in a gravitational field moves on a geodesic line in
space-time, the equation of which is written in terms of the Christoffel
symbols. Einstein found it advantageous to use for the components of the
gravitational field the Christoffel symbols. Einstein had already basically
possessed the field equations in 1912, but had not recognized the formal
importance of the Christoffel symbols as the components of the gravitational
field. Einstein probably found the final form of the generally covariant field
equations by manipulating his own (November 4, 1915) equations. Other

that PPDs undergo a transition stage at several Myr, during which gas densities
are reduced. Our Solar System would have experienced such a stage. However,
there is currently no data that provides insight into this crucial time in our
PPD's evolution. We show that the Isheyevo meteorite contains the first
definitive evidence for a transition disk stage in our Solar System. Isheyevo
belongs to a class of metal-rich meteorites whose components have been dated at
almost 5 Myr after the first solids in the Solar System, and exhibits unique
sedimentary layers that imply formation through gentle sedimentation. We show
that such layering can occur via gentle sweep-up of material found in the
impact plume resulting from the collision of two planetesimals. Such sweep-up
requires gas densities consistent with observed transition disks. As such,
Isheyevo presents the first evidence of our own transition disk and provides
new constraints on the evolution of our solar nebula.

attempts to addresse this problem by studying (Kerr-)dS_3 cosmology in Einstein

contributions exp[i(saddle-point action)] to the Hartle-Hawking wave functions
are computed with mini-superspace formalism. The saddle-point actions are first
obtained in the spacetime bulks by direct computation, then on the asymptotic
dS boundary by holographic renormalization. It is found that the imaginary part
of the saddle-point actions, as functions of scalar field deformation, are
generally bounded in the bulk, but can diverge to -infty on the boundary. This
can probably be a source of the scalar field-related non-normalizability of the
boundary Hartle-Hawking wave functions. For Kerr-dS_3 cosmology, some
saddle-point actions have imaginary parts diverging to -infty both in the bulk
and on the boundary, when the boundary T^2 is stretched to infinitely long.
This can be an origin of non-normalizability of the boundary Hartle-Hawking
wave functions related to temperature divergence. Finally the holographic
renormalization is extended to scalar-deformed dS_{d+1} (d>= 3) cosmologies for
the imaginary part of the saddle-point actions. The result is tested on a 5d

methods of inferring weak gravitational lensing shear distortions from
simulated galaxy images. GREAT3 was divided into experiments to test three
specific questions, and included simulated space- and ground-based data with
constant or cosmologically-varying shear fields. The simplest (control)
experiment included parametric galaxies with a realistic distribution of
signal-to-noise, size, and ellipticity, and a complex point spread function
(PSF). The other experiments tested the additional impact of realistic galaxy
morphology, multiple exposure imaging, and the uncertainty about a
spatially-varying PSF; the last two questions will be explored in Paper II. The
24 participating teams competed to estimate lensing shears to within systematic
error tolerances for upcoming Stage-IV dark energy surveys, making 1525
submissions overall. GREAT3 saw considerable variety and innovation in the
types of methods applied. Several teams now meet or exceed the targets in many
of the tests conducted (to within the statistical errors). We conclude that the
presence of realistic galaxy morphology in simulations changes shear
calibration biases by $\sim 1$ per cent for a wide range of methods. Other
effects such as truncation biases due to finite galaxy postage stamps, and the
impact of galaxy type as measured by the S\'{e}rsic index, are quantified for
the first time. Our results generalize previous studies regarding sensitivities
to galaxy size and signal-to-noise, and to PSF properties such as seeing and
defocus. Almost all methods' results support the simple model in which additive
shear biases depend linearly on PSF ellipticity.

the double radio relic observation and the X-ray observation of a comet-like

El Gordo is observed shortly after the first core-passage of the subclusters.
We employ a Monte Carlo simulation to investigate the three-dimensional (3D)

radio relic, we constrain the estimate of the angle between the plane of the
sky and the merger axis to be $\alpha = 21~{\rm degree} \pm^9_{11}$. We find
the relative 3D merger speed of El Gordo to be $2400\pm^{400}_{200}~{\rm

time-since-pericenter are $0.46\pm^{0.09}_{0.16}$ Gyr and
$0.91\pm^{0.22}_{0.39}$ Gyr for the outgoing and returning scenario
respectively. We put our estimates of the time-since-pericenter into context by
showing that if the time-averaged shock velocity is approximately equal to or
smaller than the pericenter velocity of the corresponding subcluster in the
center of mass frame, the two subclusters are more likely to be moving towards,
rather than away, from each other, post apocenter. We compare and contrast the
merger scenario of El Gordo with that of the Bullet Cluster, and show that this
late-stage merging scenario explains why the southeast dark matter lensing peak
of El Gordo is closer to the merger center than the southeast cool core.

gamma-rays, which allowed constraining the redshift of PKS 0447-439 by
considering the attenuation caused by gamma-ray interactions with ambient
photons in the extragalactic background light (EBL). This constraint agreed
with color-magnitude and spectroscopic redshift constraints (0.179 < z < 0.56),
Recently, however, a much higher redshift was proposed for this blazar (z >
1.2). This value was debated because if true, it would imply either that the
relevant absorption processes of gamma-rays are not well understood or that the
EBL is dramatically different from what is believed today. This high redshift
was not confirmed by three independent new spectroscopic observations at high
signal-to-noise ratios.
  Given that BL-Lac are typically hosted by elliptical galaxies, which in turn
are associated with groups, we aim to find the host group of galaxies of PKS
0447-439. The ultimate goal is to estimate a redshift for this blazar.
  Spectra of twenty-one objects in the field of view of PKS 0447-439 were
obtained with the Gemini Multi-Object Spectrograph. Based on the redshifts and
coordinates of these galaxies, we searched for groups of galaxies. Using a deep
catalog of groups, we studied the probability of finding by chance a group of

  We identified a group of galaxies that was not previously cataloged at z =

dispersion of 622 km s^-1. We found that the probability of the host galaxy of

stability of the Higgs field. A natural account of the Higgs boson mass,
however, strongly favors extensions of the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard
Model (MSSM). A plausible option is to introduce a new supersymmetric sector
coupled to the MSSM Higgs fields, whose associated states resolve the little
hierarchy problem between the third generation squark masses and the weak
scale. SUSY also accomodates a weakly interacting cold dark matter (DM)
candidate in the form of a stable neutralino. In minimal realizations, the
thus-far null results of direct DM searches, along with the DM relic abundance
constraint, introduce a level of fine-tuning as severe as the one due to the
SUSY little hierarchy problem. We analyse the generic implications of new SUSY
sectors parametrically heavier than the minimal SUSY spectrum, devised to
increase the Higgs boson mass, on this little neutralino DM problem. We focus
on the SUSY operator of smallest scaling dimension in an effective field theory
description, which modifies the Higgs and DM sectors in a correlated manner.
Within this framework, we show that recent null results from the LUX experiment
imply a tree-level fine-tuning for gaugino DM which is parametrically at least
a few times larger than that of the MSSM. Higgsino DM whose relic abundance is
generated through a thermal freeze-out mechanism remains also severely
fine-tuned, unless the DM lies below the weak boson pair-production threshold.

These galaxies were selected for their detection of the weak
[OIII]$\lambda$4363 emission line, which provides a ""direct"" measure of the
gas-phase metallicity. A primary goal for identifying these rare galaxies is to
examine whether the fundamental metallicity relation (FMR) between stellar
mass, gas metallicity, and star formation rate (SFR) holds for low stellar mass
and high SFR galaxies. The FMR suggests that higher SFR galaxies have lower
metallicity (at fixed stellar mass). To test this trend, we combine
spectroscopic measurements of metallicity and dust-corrected SFRs, with stellar
mass estimates from modeling the optical photometry. We find that these
galaxies are $1.05\pm0.61$ dex above the z~1 stellar mass-SFR relation, and
$0.23\pm0.23$ dex below the local mass-metallicity relation. Relative to the
FMR, the latter offset is reduced to 0.01 dex, but significant dispersion
remains (0.29 dex with 0.16 dex due to measurement uncertainties). This
dispersion suggests that gas accretion, star formation and chemical enrichment
have not reached equilibrium in these galaxies. This is evident by their short
stellar mass doubling timescale of $\approx100^{+310}_{-75}$ Myr that suggests
stochastic star formation. Combining our sample with other z~1 metal-poor
galaxies, we find a weak positive SFR-metallicity dependence (at fixed stellar
mass) that is significant at 94.4% confidence. We interpret this positive
correlation as recent star formation that has enriched the gas, but has not had
time to drive the metal-enriched gas out with feedback mechanisms.

optical spectra (~3700-7000 Angstrom) for ~1500 galaxies at 1.37<z<3.80 in
three well-studied CANDELS fields: AEGIS, COSMOS, and GOODS-N. Targets are
selected in three redshift intervals: 1.37<z<1.70, 2.09<z<2.61, and
2.95<z<3.80, down to fixed H_AB (F160W) magnitudes of 24.0, 24.5 and 25.0,
respectively, using the photometric and spectroscopic catalogs from the 3D-HST
survey. We target both strong nebular emission lines (e.g., [OII], Hbeta,
[OIII], 5008, Halpha, [NII], and [SII]) and stellar continuum and absorption
features (e.g., Balmer lines, Ca-II H and K, Mgb, 4000 Angstrom break). Here we
present an overview of our survey, the observational strategy, the data
reduction and analysis, and the sample characteristics based on spectra
obtained during the first 24 nights. To date, we have completed 21 masks,
obtaining spectra for 591 galaxies. For ~80% of the targets we derive a robust
redshift from either emission or absorption lines. In addition, we confirm 55
additional galaxies, which were serendipitously detected. The MOSDEF galaxy
sample includes unobscured star-forming, dusty star-forming, and quiescent
galaxies and spans a wide range in stellar mass (~10^9-10^11.5 Msol) and star
formation rate (~10^0-10^3 Msol/yr). The spectroscopically confirmed sample is
roughly representative of an H-band limited galaxy sample at these redshifts.
With its large sample size, broad diversity in galaxy properties, and wealth of
available ancillary data, MOSDEF will transform our understanding of the
stellar, gaseous, metal, dust, and black hole content of galaxies during the

inside the galactic plane not only provides a source of dark matter, but one
that is more readily bound due to the dark matter's lower velocity. This

UFPs are toxic to humans with health effects strongly linked to particle size.
School engines emit particles primarily in the UFP size range and as school
buses idle at bus stops, UFPs penetrate into cabins through cracks, doors, and
windows. How UFP counts inside buses vary by particle size over time and under
different idling conditions is not yet well understood. We model UFP counts at
a given time with a cubic B-spline basis as a function of size and allow counts
to increase over time at a size dependent rate once the engine turns on. We
explore alternate parametric models for the engine-on increase which also vary
smoothly over size. The log residual variance over size is modeled using a
quadratic B-spline basis to account for heterogeneity and an autoregressive
model is used for the residual. Model predictions are communicated graphically.
These methods provide information needed for regulating vehicle emissions to
minimize UFP exposure in the future.

disks. Their ro-vibrational lines observed in the near- and mid-infrared are
commonly detected toward T Tauri disks. These lines are the only way to probe
the chemistry in the inner few au where terrestrial planets form. To understand
this chemistry, accurate molecular abundances have to be determined. This is
complicated by excitation effects. Most analyses so far have made the
assumption of local thermal equilibrium (LTE).
  Starting from estimates for the collisional rate coefficients of HCN, non-LTE
slab models of the HCN emission were calculated to study the importance of
different excitation mechanisms. Using a new radiative transfer model, the HCN
emission from a full two-dimensional disk was then modeled to study the effect
of the non-LTE excitation, together with the line formation. We ran models
tailored to the T Tauri disk AS 205 (N) where HCN lines in both the 3 {\mu}m
and 14 {\mu}m bands have been observed by VLT-CRIRES and the Spitzer Space
Telescope.
  Reproducing the observed 3 {\mu}m / 14 {\mu}m flux ratios requires very high
densities and kinetic temperatures ($n > 10^{14}$ cm$^{-3}$ and $T > 750$ K),
if only collisional excitation is accounted for. Radiative pumping can,
however, excite the lines easily out to considerable radii $\sim$ 10 au.
Consequently, abundances derived from LTE and non-LTE models do not differ by
more than a factor of about 3. Models with both a strongly enhanced abundance
within $\sim$ 1 au (jump abundance) and constant abundance can reproduce the
current observations, but future observations with the MIRI instrument on JWST
and METIS on the E-ELT can easily distinguish between the scenarios and test
chemical models. Depending on the scenario, ALMA can detect rotational lines
within vibrationally excited levels.

superconductor and to normal leads can sustain a Majorana mode even when the
dot is expected to be empty, \emph{i.e.}, when the dot energy level is far
above the Fermi level of he leads. This is due to the Majorana bound state of
the wire leaking into the quantum dot. Here we extend this previous work by
investigating the low--temperature quantum transport through an {\it
interacting} quantum dot connected to source and drain leads and side--coupled
to a topological wire. We explore the signatures of a Majorana zero--mode
leaking into the quantum dot for a wide range of dot parameters, using a
recursive Green's function approach. We then study the Kondo regime using
numerical renormalization group calculations. We observe the interplay between
the Majorana mode and the Kondo effect for different dot-wire coupling
strengths, gate voltages and Zeeman fields. Our results show that a ""0.5""
conductance signature appears in the dot despite the interplay between the
leaked Majorana mode and the Kondo effect. This robust feature persists for a
wide range of dot parameters, even when the Kondo correlations are suppressed
by Zeeman fields and/or gate voltages. The Kondo effect, on the other hand, is
suppressed by both Zeeman fields and gate voltages. We show that the zero--bias
conductance as a function of the magnetic field follows a well--known
universality curve. This can be measured experimentally, and we propose that
the universal conductance drop followed by a persistent conductance of
$0.5\,e^2/h$ is evidence of the presence of Majorana--Kondo physics. These
results confirm that this ""0.5"" Majorana signature in the dot remains even in
the presence of the Kondo effect.

its motion with a kinematics similar to disks, i.e. moving along a cycloidal

trajectory of its center of mass later develops an inflection point so that the
ring makes a spiral turn and revolves in a retrograde direction around a new

a rolling rigid body, we show that the hollow geometry of a ring tunes the
rotational air drag resistance so that the frictional force at the contact
point with the ground changes its direction at the inflection point and puts
the ring on a retrograde spiral trajectory. Our findings have potential
applications in designing topologically new surface-effect flying objects

as a function of separation between the two components, helps describe the
dynamical environment at the time the binaries formed, which in turn offers
constraints on the dynamical evolution of the solar system. We searched the
NEOWISE archival dataset for close and contact binary Trojans and Hildas via
their diagnostically large lightcurve amplitudes. We present 48 out of 554
Hilda and 34 out of 953 Trojan binary candidates in need of follow-up to
confirm their large lightcurve amplitudes and subsequently constrain the binary
orbit and component sizes. From these candidates, we calculate a preliminary
estimate of the binary fraction without confirmation or debiasing of 14-23% for
Trojans larger than ~12 km and 30-51% for Hildas larger than ~4 km. Once the
binary candidates have been confirmed, it should be possible to infer the
underlying, debiased binary fraction through estimation of survey biases.

to Maxwell and Langmuir, the existence of a spherical solution for which
evaporating drops collapse to a point in a self-similar manner is well
established in the physical literature. The diameter of the drop follows the
so-called $D^{2}$ law: the second power of the drop-diameter decays linearly in
time. In this study we provide a complete mathematical proof of this classical
law. We prove that evaporating drops which are initially small perturbations of
a sphere collapse to a point and the shape of the drop converges to a
self-similar ellipsoid whose center, orientation, and semi-axes are determined
by the initial shape.

member of the AB Dor Moving Group, an identification supported by our
classification of W0047+68 as intermediate surface gravity (INT-G) using the
Allers \& Liu (2013) near-infrared classification system. This moving group
membership implies near-solar metallicity, age $\sim 100-125$ Myr, $M \approx
0.018~M_\odot$, and $\log g \approx 4.5$; the thick condensate clouds needed to
explain the infrared spectrum are therefore a result of the lower surface
gravity than ordinary field brown dwarfs. From the observed luminosity and
evolutionary model radius, we find $T_{eff} \approx 1300 $K, a temperature
normally associated with early T dwarfs. Thick clouds are also used to explain
the spectral properties of directly imaged giant planets, and we discuss the
successes and challenges for such substellar models in matching the observed
optical and infrared spectra. W0047+68 shows that cloud thickness is more
sensitive to intermediate surface gravity than in most models. We also present
a trigonometric parallax of the dusty L6 dwarf 2MASS J21481628+4003593. It lies
at $8.060 \pm 0.036$ parsecs; its astrometry is consistent with the view that
it is older and metal-rich.

solar flares cannot be described in terms of an unique scenario. In some cases,
the eruption of a filament appears to trigger a flare, while in others the
observations are more consistent with magnetic reconnection that produces both
the flare observational signatures (e.g., ribbons, plasma jets, post-flare
loops, etc.) and later the destabilization and eruption of a filament. We study
an event which occurred in NOAA 8471, where a flare and the activation of (at
least) two filaments were observed on 28 February 1999. By using imaging data
acquired in the 1216, 1600, 171 and 195 \AA\ TRACE channels and by BBSO in the
continnum and in H$\alpha$, a morphological study of the event is carried out.
Using TRACE 1216 and 1600 \AA\ data, an estimate of the ""pure"" Ly$\alpha$ power
is obtained. The extrapolation of the magnetic field lines is done using the
SOHO/MDI magnetograms and assuming a potential field. The potential magnetic
field extrapolation indicates that the field line connectivity changes after
the flare. The event is triggered by the destabilization of a filament located
between the two polarities of a $\delta$ spot. This destabilization involves
the magnetic arcades of the active region and causes the eruption of a second
filament, that gives rise to a CME and to plasma motions over a supergranular
cell. We conclude that in this event the two filaments play an active and
decisive role, albeit in different stages of the phenomenon, in fact the
destabilization of one filament causes brightenings, reconnection and ribbons,
while the second one, whose eruption is caused by the field reconfiguration
resulting from the previous reconnection, undergoes the greatest changes and
causes the CME.

and show that the best strategy depends on the value the censor associates with
total system censorship versus partial, and the tolerance of false positives.
If the censor has a low tolerance to false positives then choosing one
censorship resistance system is best. Otherwise choosing several systems is the
better choice, but the way traffic should be distributed over the systems
depends on the tolerance of the censor to false negatives. We demonstrate that
establishing the censor's utility function is critical to discovering the best

four BCGs (COSMOS-P 125516, 102810, 036694 and 089357) in major dry merging in
29 X-ray clusters at $0.3 \le z \le 0.6$ in the Cosmological Evolutionary

magnitude difference of $\delta m<1.5$ and a projected separation of $r_p<$ 10
kpc. Clear signatures of interaction such as extended plumes and/or significant
asymmetries are also observed in their residual images. We infer a major merger
rate of $0.55\pm0.27$ merger per Gyr at $z\sim0.43$ assuming the merger
time-scale estimate of Kitzbichler & White (2008). This inferred rate is
significantly higher than the rate in the local Universe ($0.12\pm0.03$ at
$z\sim0.07$) presented in Liu et al. (2009). We estimate that present-day BCGs
increase their luminosity (mass) by $\sim35\pm15$ per cent $(f_{mass}/0.5)$ via
major dry mergers since $z=0.6$, where $f_{mass}$ is the mean mass fraction of
companion galaxies accreted onto the central ones. Although the statistical
uncertainty due to our small sample size is relatively large, our finding is
consistent with both recent observational and theoretical results. Furthermore,
in conjunction with our previous findings in Liu et al. (2009), the discovery
of these intermediate-redshift merging BCGs is clear evidence of ongoing
assembly of BCGs via major dry mergers over the last $\sim$6 Gyr.

that Gettier cases essentially challenge the internalist notion but not the

involves the possession of only adequate reasons, or leaves room for some
inadequate reasons. We favor the latter position, which reflects a milder and

explore how synchronization occurs when the two ions are weakly coupled using a
probability distribution for the relative phase. We show that strong
correlations arise between the spin and vibrational degrees of freedom within

in turn become correlated. This allows one to indirectly infer the presence of
synchronization by measuring the ions' internal state.

adaptation from the standpoint of physics, and ask whether it is possible to
delineate what the difference is in terms of physical properties between

far-from-equilibrium statistical mechanics, we demonstrate a generalization of
the Helmholtz free energy for the finite-time stochastic evolution of driven
Newtonian matter. By analyzing this expression term by term, we are able to
argue for a general tendency in driven many-particle systems towards
self-organization into states formed through exceptionally reliable absorption
and dissipation of work energy from the surrounding environment. Subsequently,
we illustrate the mechanism of this general tendency towards physical
adaptation by analyzing the process of random hopping in driven energy
landscapes.

(STM) has a history of imaging the electronic structure of individual point
defects in conductors, semiconductors, and ultrathin films, but single-defect
electronic characterization at the nanometer-scale remains an elusive goal for
intrinsic bulk insulators. Here we report the characterization and manipulation
of individual native defects in an intrinsic bulk hexagonal boron nitride (BN)
insulator via STM. Normally, this would be impossible due to the lack of a
conducting drain path for electrical current. We overcome this problem by
employing a graphene/BN heterostructure, which exploits graphene's atomically
thin nature to allow visualization of defect phenomena in the underlying bulk
BN. We observe three different defect structures that we attribute to defects
within the bulk insulating boron nitride. Using scanning tunneling spectroscopy
(STS), we obtain charge and energy-level information for these BN defect
structures. In addition to characterizing such defects, we find that it is also

context, as the concept of wavefunction has evolved, and then in a more
specific context of modeling. The paper concentrates on a simple, abstract
one-dimensional situation. In this context, there are three problems to be
considered. In the first problem, we consider the construction of a
wavefunction as a problem of interpolation, with information content in a
multipoint perspective at finitely many discrete points and complete
uncertainty elsewhere. The wavefunction is conceived abstractly as our unified
subjective picture of information content. Each point of information is
essentially free and independent of all others. This is a wavefunction for a
classical system at the mesoscopic threshold. In the second problem, we
consider how, using the concept of scaling and renormalization, the classical
system can be brought to represent a mesoscopic level of integrated
information, with points still treated as free, but now with the need to
consider each point as an extended region, with possible boundary overlaps. We
then, in the section on the third problem, consider modeling this renormalized
system as an Ising-like system of interacting spins. This is the final picture
we develop for a mesoscopic wavefunction. This can be viewed from the
perspective of the evolution of the concept of wavefunction at the microscopic
level, and we briefly discuss the new point of view being developed here.
Finally, we present a discussion concerning the bearing of this on Gibbs
phenomenon.

in the chemical reactivity between the silicene and the substrate is still
unclear so far, which is of great importance for functionalization of silicene
layers. Here, we report the reconstructions and hybridized electronic
structures of epitaxial 4x4 silicene on Ag(111), which are revealed by scanning
tunneling microscopy and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy. The
hybridization between Si and Ag results in a metallic surface state, which can
gradually decay due to oxygen adsorption. X-ray photoemission spectroscopy
confirms the decoupling of Si-Ag bonds after oxygen treatment as well as the
relatively oxygen resistance of Ag(111) surface, in contrast to 4x4 silicene
[with respect to Ag(111)]. First-principles calculations have confirmed the
evolution of the electronic structure of silicene during oxidation. It has been
verified experimentally and theoretically that the high chemical activity of
4x4 silicene is attributable to the Si pz state, while the Ag(111) substrate
exhibits relatively inert chemical behavior.

of documents (corpus) is subdivided into smaller, meaningful, identifiable, and
verifiable sub-groups (clusters). Meaningful representation of documents and
implicitly identifying the patterns, on which this separation is performed, is
the challenging part of document clustering. We have proposed a document
clustering technique using graph based document representation with
constraints. A graph data structure can easily capture the non-linear
relationships of nodes, document contains various feature terms that can be
non-linearly connected hence a graph can easily represents this information.
Constrains, are explicit conditions for document clustering where background
knowledge is use to set the direction for Linking or Not-Linking a set of
documents for a target clusters, thus guiding the clustering process. We deemed
clustering is an ill-define problem, there can be many clustering results.
Background knowledge can be used to drive the clustering algorithm in the right
direction. We have proposed three different types of constraints, Instance
level, corpus level and cluster level constraints. A new algorithm Constrained
HAC is also proposed which will incorporate Instance level constraints as prior
knowledge; it will guide the clustering process leading to better results.
Extensive set of experiments have been performed on both synthetic and standard
document clustering datasets, results are compared on standard clustering
measures like: purity, entropy and F-measure. Results clearly establish that
our proposed approach leads to improvement in cluster quality.

associated with the regular subspace is nothing but Brownian motion. Their
traces on $F$ still inherit the inclusion relation, in other words, the trace
Dirichlet form of regular subspace on $F$ is still a regular subspace of trace
Dirichlet form of one-dimensional Brownian motion on $F$. Moreover we have
proved that the trace of Brownian motion on $F$ may be decomposed into two
part, one is the trace of the regular subspace on $F$, which has only the
non-local part and the other comes from the orthogonal complement of the
regular subspace, which has only the local part. Actually the orthogonal

performance on a variety of pattern-recognition tasks, most notably visual
classification problems. Given that DNNs are now able to classify objects in
images with near-human-level performance, questions naturally arise as to what
differences remain between computer and human vision. A recent study revealed
that changing an image (e.g. of a lion) in a way imperceptible to humans can
cause a DNN to label the image as something else entirely (e.g. mislabeling a
lion a library). Here we show a related result: it is easy to produce images
that are completely unrecognizable to humans, but that state-of-the-art DNNs
believe to be recognizable objects with 99.99% confidence (e.g. labeling with
certainty that white noise static is a lion). Specifically, we take
convolutional neural networks trained to perform well on either the ImageNet or
MNIST datasets and then find images with evolutionary algorithms or gradient
ascent that DNNs label with high confidence as belonging to each dataset class.
It is possible to produce images totally unrecognizable to human eyes that DNNs
believe with near certainty are familiar objects, which we call ""fooling
images"" (more generally, fooling examples). Our results shed light on
interesting differences between human vision and current DNNs, and raise
questions about the generality of DNN computer vision.

lightly-loaded cells is critical for tapping the potential of dense

the downlink, where it is generally assumed that a user offloaded to a small
cell will communicate with it on the uplink as well. The impact of coupled
downlink-uplink offloading is not well understood. Uplink power control and
spatial interference correlation further complicate the mathematical analysis
as compared to the downlink. We propose an accurate and tractable model to
characterize the uplink SINR and rate distribution in a multi-tier HCN as a
function of the association rules and power control parameters. Joint
uplink-downlink rate coverage is also characterized. Using the developed
analysis, it is shown that the optimal degree of channel inversion (for uplink
power control) increases with load imbalance in the network. In sharp contrast
to the downlink, minimum path loss association is shown to be optimal for
uplink rate. Moreover, with minimum path loss association and full channel
inversion, uplink SIR is shown to be invariant of infrastructure density. It is
further shown that a decoupled association---employing differing association
strategies for uplink and downlink---leads to significant improvement in joint
uplink-downlink rate coverage over the standard coupled association in HCNs.

severely and moderately ill-posed problems, we establish quantitative bounds
for the distance between the $k$-dimensional Krylov subspace and the subspace

results in the broadening of a single electron-energy level to an energy band
with density-of-states (DOS) distribution of Lorentzian shape. As a
consequence, the tunneling probability at the edge of tunneling window no
longer changes abruptly from zero to having a finite value. By adjusting the
parameters in the Lorentzian function, an accurate fitting to the measured
transfer characteristics in the subthreshold region is made possible. Besides,
with an analytical formula to calculate the channel potential, the model is
able to cover naturally the transition from QCL to CL regime when the device
size is scaled. Furthermore, on-voltage is defined to facilitate the modeling
and fitting processes. Comparisons with the experimental data demonstrate the
model accuracy across all device operation regions and the flexibility in model

i.e. human saliency is distinctive and reliable in pedestrian matching across
disjoint camera views. However, such valuable information is often hidden when
computing similarities of pedestrian images with existing approaches. Inspired
by our user study result of human perception on human saliency, we propose a
novel perspective for person re-identification based on learning human saliency
and matching saliency distribution. The proposed saliency learning and matching
framework consists of four steps: (1) To handle misalignment caused by drastic
viewpoint change and pose variations, we apply adjacency constrained patch
matching to build dense correspondence between image pairs. (2) We propose two
alternative methods, i.e. K-Nearest Neighbors and One-class SVM, to estimate a
saliency score for each image patch, through which distinctive features stand
out without using identity labels in the training procedure. (3) saliency
matching is proposed based on patch matching. Matching patches with
inconsistent saliency brings penalty, and images of the same identity are
recognized by minimizing the saliency matching cost. (4) Furthermore, saliency
matching is tightly integrated with patch matching in a unified structural
RankSVM learning framework. The effectiveness of our approach is validated on
the VIPeR dataset and the CUHK01 dataset. Our approach outperforms the
state-of-the-art person re-identification methods on both datasets.

development and efficient operation of wind energy resources. This is, however,
a very challenging problem. Although on the large scale, the wind speed is
related to atmospheric pressure, temperature, and other meteorological
variables, no improvement in forecasting accuracy was found by incorporating
air pressure and temperature directly into an advanced space-time statistical
forecasting model, the trigonometric direction diurnal (TDD) model. This paper
proposes to incorporate the geostrophic wind as a new predictor in the TDD
model. The geostrophic wind captures the physical relationship between wind and
pressure through the observed approximate balance between the pressure gradient
force and the Coriolis acceleration due to the Earth's rotation. Based on our
numerical experiments with data from West Texas, our new method produces more
accurate forecasts than does the TDD model using air pressure and temperature
for 1- to 6-hour-ahead forecasts based on three different evaluation criteria.
Furthermore, forecasting errors can be further reduced by using moving average
hourly wind speeds to fit the diurnal pattern. For example, our new method
obtains between 13.9% and 22.4% overall mean absolute error reduction relative
to persistence in 2-hour-ahead forecasts, and between 5.3% and 8.2% reduction
relative to the best previous space-time methods in this setting.

on a 1,000-AU scale. Continuum and C18O (2-1) emission are detected toward all
the sample sources and show central primary components with sizes of ~600-1,500
AU associated with protostars. The velocity gradients in C18O (2-1) have wide
ranges of orientations from parallel to perpendicular to the outflows, with
magnitudes from ~1 to ~530 km/s/pc. We construct a simple kinematic model to
reproduce the observed velocity gradients, estimate the infalling and
rotational velocities, and infer the disk radii and the protostellar masses.
The inferred disk radii range from <5 AU to >500 AU with estimated protostellar
masses from <0.1 Msun to >1 Msun. Our results hint that both large and small
disks are possibly present around Class 0 protostars, which could be a sign of
disk growth at the Class 0 stage. In addition, the directions of the overall
velocity gradients in 7 out of the 17 sources are close to perpendicular to
their outflow axes, which is a signature of significant rotational motions.
From our model fitting, the specific angular momenta in these sources are
estimated to be >2E-4 km/s*pc, suggesting that magnetic braking is unlikely
efficient on a 1,000-AU scale in these Class 0 and 0/I sources. In a sub-sample
with observed magnetic field orientations, we find no source with large
specific angular momenta together with closely aligned magnetic field and
outflow axes. This possibly hints that the magnetic field, if originally
aligned with the rotational axis, can play a role in removing angular momentum
from infalling material at the Class 0 stage. We discuss our results in
comparison with theoretical models of collapsing dense cores with and without
magnetic fields in the context of disk formation.

corresponding point process is equivalent to a branching process, assuming that
an earthquake generates a cluster of offspring earthquakes (triggered
earthquakes or so-called aftershocks). Further, the size of the
first-generation cluster depends on the magnitude of the triggering (parent)
earthquake. The ETAS model provides a good fit to standard earthquake
occurrences. However, there are nonstandard earthquake series that appear under
transient stress changes caused by aseismic forces such as volcanic magma or
fluid intrusions. These events trigger transient nonstandard earthquake swarms,
and they are poorly fitted by the stationary ETAS model. In this study, we
examine nonstationary extensions of the ETAS model that cover nonstandard
cases. These models allow the parameters to be time-dependent and can be
estimated by the empirical Bayes method. The best model is selected among the
competing models to provide the inversion solutions of nonstationary changes.
To address issues of the uniqueness and robustness of the inversion procedure,
this method is demonstrated on an inland swarm activity induced by the 2011

experimental data via fragmentation cascades. To obtain biochemically
meaningful results requires an elaborate optimization function. We present a
new scoring for computing fragmentation trees, transforming the combinatorial
optimization into a maximum a posteriori estimator. We demonstrate the

a video I propose a new algorithm for detecting foreground objects in a video.
The process of detecting the foreground objects is complicated because of the
fact that there may be swaying trees, objects of the background being moved
around or lighting changes in the video. To deal with such complexities many
have come up with solutions which heavily rely on expensive floating point
operations. In this paper I used a data structure called Octree which is
implemented only using binary operations. Traditionally octrees were used for
color quantization but here in this paper I used it as a data structure to
store the most frequently occuring colors in a video as well. For each of the
starting few video frames, I constructed a Octree using all the colors of that
frame. Next I pruned all the trees by removing nodes below a certain height and
gave the leaf nodes a color which is dependant on the topological path from
that node to its parent. Hence any two leaf nodes in two different octrees with
the same topological path from themselves to the root will represent the same
color. Next I merged all these individual trees into a single tree retaining
only those nodes whose topological path to itself from the root is most common
among all the trees. The colors represented by the leaf nodes in the resultant
tree will be the most frequently occuring colors in the starting video frames
of the video. Hence any color of an incomming frame that is not close to any of
the colors represented by the leaf node of the merged tree can be regarded as
belonging to a foreground object.
  As an Octree is constructed using only binary operations, it is very fast
compared to other leading algorithms.

13CO emission in IRC+10216, the envelope of CW Leo, the high mass loss star the
closest to the Sun. IRC+10216 is nearly spherical and expands radially with a
velocity of 14.5 km/s. The observations, made with the IRAM 30-m telescope,
have a sensibility, calibration, and angular resolution far higher than
previous studies. The angular resolution is 11"", which corresponds to an
expansion time of 500 yr. The CO emission consists of a centrally peaked
pedestal and a series of bright, nearly spherical shells. It peaks on CW Leo
and remains relatively strong up to 180"". Further out it becomes very weak and
vanishes as CO gets photodissociated. The CO maps allow to trace the mass loss
history in the last 8000 yr. The bright CO shells denote overdense regions,
which indicate that the mass loss process is highly variable on timescales of
hundreds of years. The new data, however, infirm previous claims of a strong
decrease of the average mass loss in the last few thousand years. The overdense
shells are not perfectly concentric and extend farther to the N-NW. The typical
shell separation is 800-1000 yr in the middle of the envelope, but seems to
increase outwards. The shell-intershell brightness contrast is $\geq$ 3. All
those key features can be accounted for if CW Leo has a companion star with a
period of $\sim$ 800 yr that increases the mass loss rate when it comes close
to periastron. Higher angular resolution observations are needed to fully
resolve the dense shells and measure the density contrast. The latter plays an
essential role for our understanding of the envelope chemistry.

are determined and, subsequently, we focus exclusively on the weak coupling
regime. We then calculate the dispersion relation of the surface plasmon mode
on graphene and, by varying the chemical potential, show a good control of its
resonance frequency. Using a Green's tensor formalism, we calculate the
spontaneous emission and energy transfer rates of quantum systems placed near
the graphene monolayer. The spontaneous emission rate of a single quantum
system is enhanced by several orders of magnitude close to the graphene
monolayer and we show that this enhancement is due almost exclusively to
excitation of the surface plasmon mode. When considering the energy transfer
rate between two quantum systems, we find a similar enhancement of several
orders of magnitude close to the graphene monolayer. The direct interaction
between the donor and acceptor dominates when they are close to each other, but
is modified from its free-space behavior due to the presence of the graphene
monolayer. As the donor-acceptor separation is increased, their direct
interaction is overshadowed by the interaction via the surface plasmon mode.
Due to the large propagation length of surface plasmon mode on graphene --
hundreds of nanometers -- this enhancement of the energy transfer rate holds
over large donor-acceptor separations along the graphene monolayer.

significantly departs from experimental observations. The correct critical
isotherms are heuristically re-established via the Maxwell equal areas rule. A
long standing open problem in mean field theory is concerned with the analytic
description of van der Waals isotherms for a finite size system that is
consistent, in the thermodynamic limit, with the Maxwell prescription. Inspired
by the theory of nonlinear conservation laws, we propose a novel mean field
approach, based on statistical mechanics, that allows to calculate the van der
Waals partition function for a system of large but finite number of particles
$N$. Our partition function naturally extends to the whole space of
thermodynamic variables, reproduces, in the thermodynamic limit $N\to \infty$,
the classical results outside the critical region and automatically encodes
Maxwell's prescription. We show that isothermal curves evolve in the space of
thermodynamic variables like nonlinear breaking waves and the criticality is
explained as the mechanism of formation of a classical hydrodynamic shock.

Some time ago, Leahy and Unruh showed that, in two dimensions with a
Schwarzschild geometry, a scalar field theory with a quartic interaction gets
the coupling switched off near the horizon of the black hole. This would imply
that interaction has no effect on Hawking radiation and free theory for
particles can be used. Recently, a set of exact classical solutions for the
quartic scalar field theory has been obtained. These solutions display a
massive dispersion relation even if the starting theory is massless. When one
considers the corresponding quantum field theory, this mass gap becomes a tower
of massive excitations and, at the leading order, the theory is trivial. We
apply these results to Hawking radiation for a Kerr geometry and prove that the
Leahy-Unruh effect is at work. Approaching the horizon the scalar field theory
has the mass gap going to zero. We devise a technique to study the interacting
scalar theory very near the horizon increasing the coupling. As these solutions
are represented by a Fourier series of plane waves, Hawking radiation can be
immediately obtained with well-known techniques. These results open a question
about the behavior of the Standard Model of particles very near the horizon of
a black hole where the interactions turn out to be switched off and the
electroweak symmetry could be restored.

of state the temperature $T$ and chemical potential $\mu_{\mathrm{B}}$ can be
determined. The approach goes beyond simplified fireball models of the
bulk-medium evolution by treating the full (3+1)-dimensional expansion of the

$\rho$ spectral function with a small mass shift. In contrast, the intermediate
mass region ($M > 1.5$ GeV) is dominated by a contribution from the quark-gluon

parametrizations. This agreement in spite of differences in the reaction

orbit of the comet is affected by the sublimation of ice from the nucleus that
triggers non-gravitational forces. The comet also experienced several close
encounters with Jupiter especially in 1959 and 1923 (less than 1 AU). These
perturbations cause the chaoticity of the comet orbit at short time scale. The
goal of this paper is to have a precise idea of the comet recent dynamical
history. This is done in studying the mean trends of the comet orbital elements
and also in characterizing its chaotic motion with the Fast Lyapunov indicator.
To compute these mean trends, two sets (considering or not the
non-gravitational forces) of 1000 clone orbits of the comet were considered.
This paper shows that the last close encounter with Jupiter on February
$4^{\text{th}}$, 1959 drastically modified the orbital elements of the comet
(especially the perihelion distance from more than 2.7 AU prior the encounter
to 1.3 AU after the encounter). The motion of the comet is also shown to be

coronal features comprising a double-peak flare, a coronal dimming caused by a
CME, a CME-driven compression, and a fast-mode wave. For the first time, the
evolution of an asymmetric eruptive filament is analysed in simultaneous SUMER
spectroscopic and TRACE and EIT imaging data. We use imaging observations from
EIT and TRACE in the 195A channel and spectroscopic observations from the CDS
in a rastering and SUMER in a sit-and-stare observing mode. The SUMER spectra
cover spectral lines with formation temperatures from logT(K) ~ 4.0 to 6.1.
Although the event was already analysed in two previous studies, our analysis
brings a wealth of new information on the dynamics and physical properties of
the observed phenomena. We found that the dynamic event is related to a complex
flare with two distinct impulsive peaks, one according to the GOES
classification as C1.1 and the second - C1.9. The first energy release triggers
a fast-mode wave and a CME with a clear CME driven compression ahead of it.
This activity is related to, or possibly caused, by an asymmetric filament
eruption. The filament is observed to rise with its leading edge moving at a
speed of ~300 km/s detected both in the SUMER and CDS data. The rest of the
filament body moves at only ~150 km/s while untwisting. No signature is found
of the fast-mode wave in the SUMER data, suggesting that the plasma disturbed
by the wave had temperatures above 600 000 K. The erupting filament material is
found to emit only in spectral lines at transition region temperatures. Earlier
identification of a coronal response detected in the Mg X 609.79 A line is
found to be caused by a blend from the O IV 609.83 A line.

each node puts a deterministic weight to each recommendation, and then encodes
these weighted recommendations in its state update through stochastic

parameter is 8 from an analysis of 97 sources. Since the magnetization
parameter can be interpreted as the maximum possible Lorentz factor of the bulk
motion which can be obtained for relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) flow,
this estimate is in agreement with the observed superluminal motion of bright
features in AGN jets. Moreover, knowing these key parameters, one can determine
the transverse structure of the flow. We show that the poloidal magnetic field

jet acceleration. Finally, casual connectivity of strongly collimated jets is
discussed.

networks (i.e., without a direct link between the source and the destination,
and with N non-interfering relays) an approximately optimal relay scheduling
policy (i.e., achieving the cut-set upper bound to within a constant gap) has
at most N+1 active states (i.e., at most N+1 out of the $2^N$ possible relay
listen-transmit states have a strictly positive probability). Such relay
scheduling policies were referred to as simple. In ITW'13 we conjectured that
simple approximately optimal relay scheduling policies exist for any Gaussian
half-duplex multi-relay network irrespectively of the topology. This paper
formally proves this more general version of the conjecture and shows it holds
beyond Gaussian noise networks. In particular, for any memoryless half-duplex
N-relay network with independent noises and for which independent inputs are
approximately optimal in the cut-set upper bound, an approximately optimal
simple relay scheduling policy exists. A convergent iterative polynomial-time
algorithm, which alternates between minimizing a submodular function and
maximizing a linear program, is proposed to find the approximately optimal
simple relay schedule. As an example, for N-relay Gaussian networks with
independent noises, where each node in equipped with multiple antennas and
where each antenna can be configured to listen or transmit irrespectively of
the others, the existence of an approximately optimal simple relay scheduling
policy with at most N+1 active states is proved. Through a line-network example
it is also shown that independently switching the antennas at each relay can
provide a strictly larger multiplexing gain compared to using the antennas for

synthesis techniques and equivalent width measurements of selected lines,
isolated and free of significant blending and/or contamination by telluric
lines, allowed accurate chemical abundances and radial velocities to be

average heliocentric radial velocity of +57$\pm$1.8\,km/s and mean iron

way to derive geometric numerical methods. These methods preserve a discrete
multisymplectic form as well as momenta associated to symmetries of the
Lagrangian via Noether's theorem. An inevitable prerequisite for the derivation
of variational integrators is the existence of a variational formulation for
the considered problem. Even though for a large class of systems this
requirement is fulfilled, there are many interesting examples which do not
belong to this class, e.g., equations of advection-diffusion type frequently
encountered in fluid dynamics or plasma physics. On the other hand, it is
always possible to embed an arbitrary dynamical system into a larger Lagrangian
system using the method of formal (or adjoint) Lagrangians. We investigate the
application of the variational integrator method to formal Lagrangians, and
thereby extend the application domain of variational integrators to include
potentially all dynamical systems. The theory is supported by physically
relevant examples, such as the advection equation and the vorticity equation,
and numerically verified. Remarkably, the integrator for the vorticity equation
combines Arakawa's discretisation of the Poisson brackets with a symplectic
time stepping scheme in a fully covariant way such that the discrete energy is
exactly preserved. In the presentation of the results, we try to make the
geometric framework of variational integrators accessible to non specialists.

the 1 - 2 $M_{\odot}$ interval to depend quasi-quadratically on stellar mass,

results give rise to an elegant classification of theorems of ordinary

theorems fall into only five categories of which the associated logical systems
are dubbed `the Big Five'. Recently, a lot of effort has been directed towards
finding \emph{exceptional} theorems, i.e.\ which fall outside the Big Five
categories. The so-called Reverse Mathematics zoo is a collection of such
exceptional theorems (and their relations). In this paper, we show that the
uniform versions of the zoo-theorems, i.e. where a functional computes the
objects stated to exist, all fall in the third Big Five category arithmetical
comprehension, inside Kohlenbach's higher-order Reverse Mathematics. In other
words, the zoo seems to disappear at the uniform level. Our classification
applies to all theorems whose objects exhibit little structure, a notion we
conjecture to be connected to Montalban's notion robustness. Surprisingly, our
methodology reveals a hitherto unknown `computational' aspect of Nonstandard

the proof of a specific equivalence in Nelson's internal set theory, and
outputs the proof of the desired equivalence (not involving Nonstandard
Analysis) between the uniform zoo principle and arithmetical comprehension.
Moreover, the equivalences thus proved are even explicit, i.e. a term from the

from the other one and vice versa.

formation. Turbulence supports molecular cloud cores from evolving to
gravitational collapse and hence sets a lower bound on the size of molecular
cloud cores in which star formation can occur. On the other hand, without a
continuous external energy source maintaining the turbulence, such as in
molecular clouds, the turbulence decays with an energy dissipation time
comparable to the dynamic timescale of clouds, which could change the size
limits obtained from Jean's criterion by assuming constant turbulence
intensities. Here we adopt scaling relations of physical variables in decaying
turbulence to analyze its specific effects on the formation of stars. We find
that the decay of turbulence provides an additional approach for Jeans'
criterion to be achieved, after which gravitational infall governs the motion
of the cloud core. This epoch of turbulence decay is defined as cloud core
relaxation. The existence of cloud core relaxation provides a more complete
understanding in the competition between turbulence and gravity on the dynamics

The aim of this paper is to analyse the previously discovered
discontinuity of the periodicity of the GeV $\gamma$-ray emission of the
radio-loud X-ray binary LS I +61{\deg}303 and to determine its physical origin.
Methods. We used wavelet analysis to explore the temporal development of
periodic signals. The wavelet analysis was first applied to the whole data set
of available Fermi-LAT data and then to the two subsets of orbital phase
intervals $\Phi = 0.0 - 0.5$ and $\Phi = 0.5 - 1.0$. We also performed a
Lomb-Scargle timing Analysis. We investigated the similarities between GeV
$\gamma$-ray emission and radio emission by comparing the folded curves of the
Fermi-LAT data and the Green Bank Interferometer radio data. Results. During
the epochs when the timing analysis fails to determine the orbital periodicity,
the periodicity is present in the two orbital phase intervals $\Phi = 0.0 -
0.5$ and $\Phi = 0.5 - 1.0$. That is, there are two periodical signals, one
towards periastron (i.e., $\Phi = 0.0 - 0.5$) and another one towards apoastron
($\Phi = 0.5 - 1.0$). The apoastron peak seems to be affected by the same
orbital shift as the radio outbursts and, in addition, reveals the same two
periods $P_1$ and $P_2$ that are present in the radio data. Conclusions. The
$\gamma$-ray emission of the apoastron peak normally just broadens the emission
of the peak around periastron. Only when it appears at $\Phi \approx 0.8 -
1.0$, because of the orbital shift, it is enough detached from the first peak
to become recognisable as a second orbital peak, which is the reason why the
timing analysis fails. Two $\gamma$-ray peaks along the orbit are predicted by
the two-peak accretion model for an eccentric orbit, that was proposed by
several authors for LS I +61{\deg}303.

years later, their approach is still effective for evaluating the homogenized

author's (2013) variational reformulation approximated by trigonometric
polynomials establishing two numerical schemes: Galerkin approximation (Ga) and
a version with numerical integration (GaNi). The latter approach, fully
equivalent to the original Moulinec-Suquet algorithm, was used to evaluate
guaranteed upper-lower bounds on homogenized coefficients incorporating a
closed-form double grid quadrature. Here, these concepts, based on the primal
and the dual formulations, are employed for the Ga scheme. For the same
computational effort, the Ga outperforms the GaNi with more accurate guaranteed
bounds and more predictable numerical behaviors. Quadrature technique leading
to block-sparse linear systems is extended here to materials defined via
high-resolution images in a way which allows for effective treatment using the
FFT. Memory demands are reduced by a reformulation of the double to the
original grid scheme using FFT shifts. Minimization of the bounds during
iterations of conjugate gradients is effective, particularly when incorporating
a solution from a coarser grid. The methodology presented here for the scalar
linear elliptic problem could be extended to more complex frameworks.

graphs. Players Min and Max alternately place brushes on the vertices of a
graph. When a vertex accumulates at least as many brushes as its degree, it
sends one brush to each neighbor and is removed from the graph; this may in
turn induce the removal of other vertices. The game ends once all vertices have
been removed. Min seeks to minimize the number of brushes played during the
game, while Max seeks to maximize it. When both players play optimally, the
length of the game is the game brush number of the graph $G$, denoted $b_g(G)$.
  By considering strategies for both players and modelling the evolution of the
game with differential equations, we provide an asymptotic value for the game
brush number of the complete graph; namely, we show that $b_g(K_n) =
(1+o(1))n^2/e$. Using a fractional version of the game, we couple the game
brush numbers of complete graphs and the binomial random graph

clustering actually helps to reduce path length in PRNs. Further, the paths
found via our EDS local search algorithm are more congruent with the
characteristics of intra-protein communication. EDS identifies a subset of PRN
edges called short-cuts that are distinct, have high usage, impacts EDS path
length, diversity and stretch, and are dominated by short-range contacts. The
short-cuts form a network (SCN) that increases in size and transitivity as a
protein folds. The structure of a SCN supports its function and formation, and
the function of a SCN influences its formation. Several significant differences
in terms of SCN structure, function and formation is found between successful

aspects of PRNs, the protein folding process becomes a problem of graph
formation with the purpose of forming suitable pathways within proteins.

thermal freeze-out model which incorporates the rapidity (collision) axis as
well as transverse direction boosts developed within an expanding hot and dense
hadronic fluid (fireball) till the final freeze-out. We determine the
thermo-chemical freeze-out conditions particularly in terms of temperature,
baryon chemical potential and collective flow effect parameters for different
particle species. The parameters indicate occurrence of freeze-out of the
singly and doubly strange hyperon species at somewhat earlier times during the

degree of centrality is also described and it is found that the kinetic
temperature increases and collective flow effect decreases with decreasing
centrality at all energies studied. The nuclear transparency effect is also
studied and it is clear from our model that the nuclear matter becomes more
transparent at the highest RHIC energy compared to lower RHIC energies. The
contribution of heavier hadronic resonance decay is taken into account.

Comments are welcome",,,,"gr-qc hep-th quant-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  It was known long ago that quantum theory and general relativity, two pillars
of modern physics, are in sharp conflict in their foundations. Their
fundamental inconsistencies render a consistent theory of quantum gravity the
most challenging problem in physics. Here we propose an information-complete
quantum field theory (ICQFT), which describes elementary fermions, their gauge
fields, and gravity (together, called the trinary fields) as an elementary
trinity without any conceptual inconsistency of existing theories. We then
argue that the ICQFT provides a coherent picture and conceptual framework of
unifying matter and spacetime (gravity) as information via spacetime-matter
entanglement and gives a compelling solution to the problem of time and time's
arrow. The trinary fields are characterized by dual entanglement and dual
dynamics. Spacetime-matter entanglement encodes complete physical predictions
of the theory and allows us to give a quantum information definition of dark
energy. We consider two particular forms of spacetime-matter entangled states
and their physical consequences. One of them\ is consistent with the
variational holographic relation and another results in an universal relation
between entanglement entropy and geometry (area and volume). This latter
relation allows us to determine the cosmological constant term in the classical
Einstein equation and implies that our Universe is not strictly holographic due
to dark energy (related to an universal negative pressure). We predict the
interior quantum state of a Schwarzschild black hole to be maximally
information-complete. As a concrete quantum formulation of gravity coupled with
matter, the ICQFT is about quantum information dynamics for spacetime and
matter and eliminates the conceptual obstacles of existing quantum gravity
theory.

nature of the observed jets in relation to the bulk flow is still unclear. In
particular it is not clear whether the observations of parsec-scale jets using
the very long baseline interferometric technique (VLBI) reveal wave-like
structures that develop and propagate along the jet, or trace the jet flow
itself. In this contribution I review the evidence collected during the last
years showing that the ridge-lines of helical radio-jets do not correspond to
observational artifacts. This conclusion was reached by studying a number of
VLBI observations of the radio jet in the quasar S5~0836+710 at different
frequencies and epochs. The ridge-line of the emission in the jet coincides at
all frequencies within the errors. Moreover, small differences between the
ridge-lines as observed at different epochs reveal wave-like motion transversal
to the jet propagation axis. I also discuss similar results, albeit with
different interpretations, obtained by other authors. The current challenge is
to measure the propagation velocities of these waves and to try to characterise
them in terms of simple perturbations or Kelvin-Helmholtz instability, which
would help understanding the physical conditions of the flow where the waves
develop. This problem can only be tackled by high-resolution observations such
as those that can be achieved by the space radio-antenna Radioastron.
