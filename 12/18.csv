evolutionary histories, species tree estimation requires multiple loci from
across the genome. While many processes can result in discord between gene
trees and species trees, incomplete lineage sorting (ILS), modeled by the
multi-species coalescent, is considered to be a dominant cause for gene tree
heterogeneity. Coalescent-based methods have been developed to estimate species
trees, many of which operate by combining estimated gene trees, and so are
called summary methods. Because summary methods are generally fast, they have
become very popular techniques for estimating species trees from multiple loci.
However, recent studies have established that summary methods can have reduced
accuracy in the presence of gene tree estimation error, and also that many
biological datasets have substantial gene tree estimation error, so that
summary methods may not be highly accurate on biologically realistic
conditions. Mirarab et al. (Science 2014) presented the statistical binning
technique to improve gene tree estimation in multi-locus analyses, and showed
that it improved the accuracy of MP-EST, one of the most popular
coalescent-based summary methods. Statistical binning, which uses a simple
statistical test for combinability and then uses the larger sets of genes to
re-calculate gene trees, has good empirical performance, but using statistical
binning within a phylogenomics pipeline does not have the desirable property of
being statistically consistent. We show that weighting the recalculated gene
trees by the bin sizes makes statistical binning statistically consistent under
the multispecies coalescent, and maintains the good empirical performance.
Thus, ""weighted statistical binning"" enables highly accurate genome-scale
species tree estimation, and is also statistical consistent under the
multi-species coalescent model.

during the early stages of a Drosophila melanogaster embryonic development,
determines the differential spatial patterns of gene expression and subsequent
cell fate determination. This is mainly achieved by diffusion elicited by the
different concentrations of the Bicoid protein in the embryo. Such chemical
dynamic progress can be simulated by stochastic models, particularly the
Gillespie alogrithm. However, as with various modelling approaches in biology,
each technique involves drawing assumptions and reducing the model complexity
sometimes limiting the model capability. This is mainly due to the complexity
of the software modelling approaches to construct these models. Agent-based
modelling is a technique which is becoming increasingly popular for modelling
the behaviour of individual molecules or cells in computational biology.
  This paper attempts to compare these two popular modelling techniques of
stochastic and agent-based modelling to show how the model can be studied in
detail using the different approaches. This paper presents how to use these
techniques with the advantages and disadvantages of using either of these.
Through various comparisons, such as computation complexity and results
obtained, we show that although the same model is implemented, both approaches
can give varying results. The results of the paper show that the stochastic
model is able to give smoother results compared to the agent-based model which
may need further analysis at a later stage. We discuss the reasons for these
results and how these could be rectified in systems biology research.

parallel currents and the local shearing of field-lines. The criterion is
derived for general three-dimensional magnetic equilibria including stellarator
plasmas. Details are provided on how to implement it in cylindrical
coordinates, and in flux coordinates that rely on the geometric toroidal angle.
A means of switching between guiding-centre and full-orbit equations at first
order in Larmor radius with minimal discrepancy is shown. Techniques are
applied to a MAST (Mega Amp Spherical Tokamak) helical core equilibrium in
which the inner kinked flux-surfaces are tightly compressed against the outer
axisymmetric mantle and where the parallel current peaks at the nearly rational
surface. This is put in relation with the simpler situation $\vec{B}(x,y,z) =
B_0 [\sin(kx) \vec{e_y} + \cos(kx)\vec{e_z}]$, for which full orbits and lowest

radiation at the temperature of the horizon requires the Hubble rate, $H$, to
approach the same type of evolution as in the ""intermediate inflation""

such behaviour does not conflict with observations when the vacuum energy is
described by a slowly-rolling scalar field, and when the fluctuations in the
scalar field are treated as in the ""warm inflation"" scenario. It does, however,
change the asymptotic states of the universe. We find that the existence of the
radiation introduces a curvature singularity at early times, where the energy
densities in both the radiation and the vacuum diverge. Furthermore, we show
that the introduction of an additional non-interacting perfect fluid into the
space-time reveals that radiation can dominate over dust at late times, in
contrast to what occurs in the standard cosmological model. Such a coupling can
also lead to a negative vacuum energy becoming positive.

acute infections and we address the role of host mobility and cross-immunity in
shaping possible dominance/co-dominance regimes. Host mobility is modelled as a
network of traveling flows connecting nodes of a metapopulation, and the
two-pathogen dynamics is simulated with a stochastic mechanistic approach.
Results depict a complex scenario where, according to the relation among the
epidemiological parameters of the two pathogens, mobility can either be
non-influential for the competition dynamics or play a critical role in
selecting the dominant pathogen. The characterisation of the parameter space
can be explained in terms of the trade-off between pathogen's spreading
velocity and its ability to diffuse in a sparse environment. Variations in the
cross-immunity level induce a transition between presence and absence of
competition. The present study disentangles the role of the relevant biological
and ecological factors in the competition dynamics, and provides relevant
insights into the spatial ecology of infectious diseases.

reference and a distorted/test image and predict the perceptual quality of the
test image in terms of a scalar value representing an objective score. The
evaluation of FR-IQA techniques is carried out by comparing the objective
scores from the techniques with the subjective scores (obtained from human
observers) provided in the image databases used for the IQA. Hence, we
reasonably assume that the goal of a human observer is to rate the distortion
present in the test image. The goal oriented tasks are processed by the human
visual system (HVS) through top-down processing which actively searches for
local distortions driven by the goal. Therefore local distortion measures in an
image are important for the top-down processing. At the same time, bottom-up
processing also takes place signifying spontaneous visual functions in the HVS.
To account for this, global perceptual features can be used. Therefore, we
hypothesize that the resulting objective score for an image can be derived from
the combination of local and global distortion measures calculated from the
reference and test images. We calculate the local distortion by measuring the
local correlation differences from the gradient and contrast information. For
global distortion, dissimilarity of the saliency maps computed from a bottom-up
model of saliency is used. The motivation behind the proposed approach has been
thoroughly discussed, accompanied by an intuitive analysis. Finally,
experiments are conducted in six benchmark databases suggesting the
effectiveness of the proposed approach that achieves competitive performance
with the state-of-the-art methods providing an improvement in the overall
performance.

consequences of fluctuation-dissipation dynamics in the post-inflationary

analyze in detail two important effects. Firstly, we show that dissipative
friction delays the process of spontaneous symmetry breaking and may even damp
the the motion of a Higgs field sufficiently to induce a late period of warm
inflation. Along with dissipative entropy production, this may parametrically
dilute the abundance of dangerous thermal relics. Secondly, we show that
dissipation can generate the observed baryon asymmetry without symmetry
restoration, and we develop in detail a model of dissipative leptogenesis. We
further show that this generically leads to characteristic baryon isocurvature
perturbations that can be tested with CMB observations. This work provides a
fundamental framework to go beyond the leading thermal equilibrium

  Assessment in Natural Images","13 pages, 6 figures, 3 tables",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A blind approach to evaluate the perceptual sharpness present in a natural
image is proposed. Though the literature demonstrates a set of variegated
visual cues to detect or evaluate the absence or presence of sharpness, we
emphasize in the current work that high frequency content and local standard
deviation can form strong features to compute perceived sharpness in any
natural image, and can be considered an able alternative for the existing cues.
Unsharp areas in a natural image happen to exhibit uniform intensity or lack of
sharp changes between regions. Sharp region transitions in an image are caused
by the presence of spatial high frequency content. Therefore, in the proposed
approach, we hypothesize that using the high frequency content as the principal
stimulus, the perceived sharpness can be quantified in an image. When an image
is convolved with a high pass filter, higher values at any pixel location
signify the presence of high frequency content at those locations. Considering
these values as the stimulus, the exponent of the stimulus is weighted by local
standard deviation to impart the contribution of the local contrast within the
formation of the sharpness map. The sharpness map highlights the relatively
sharper regions in the image and is used to calculate the perceived sharpness
score of the image. The advantages of the proposed method lie in its use of
simple visual cues of high frequency content and local contrast to arrive at
the perceptual score, and requiring no training with the images. The promise of
the proposed method is demonstrated by its ability to compute perceived
sharpness for within image and across image sharpness changes and for blind
evaluation of perceptual degradation resulting due to presence of blur.
Experiments conducted on several databases demonstrate improved performance of
the proposed method over that of the state-of-the-art techniques.

distributions, using a combination of optimal transport maps and the
Metropolis-Hastings rule. The core idea is to use continuous transportation to
transform typical Metropolis proposal mechanisms (e.g., random walks, Langevin
methods) into non-Gaussian proposal distributions that can more effectively
explore the target density. Our approach adaptively constructs a lower
triangular transport map-an approximation of the Knothe-Rosenblatt
rearrangement-using information from previous MCMC states, via the solution of
an optimization problem. This optimization problem is convex regardless of the
form of the target distribution. It is solved efficiently using a Newton method
that requires no gradient information from the target probability distribution;
the target distribution is instead represented via samples. Sequential updates
enable efficient and parallelizable adaptation of the map even for large
numbers of samples. We show that this approach uses inexact or truncated maps
to produce an adaptive MCMC algorithm that is ergodic for the exact target
distribution. Numerical demonstrations on a range of parameter inference
problems show order-of-magnitude speedups over standard MCMC techniques,
measured by the number of effectively independent samples produced per target
density evaluation and per unit of wallclock time.

been applied in search of a satisfactory microscopic mechanistic explanation.
However, many of the conclusions drawn have implicitly assumed a {\em
homogeneous} material response. Here, we reveal inherently {\em inhomogeneous}
behavior in the study of the dynamics of individual VO$_2$ micro-crystals using
a combination of femtosecond pump-probe microscopy with nano-IR imaging. The
time scales of the photoinduced bandgap reorganization in the ultrafast IMT
vary from $\simeq 40 \pm 8$ fs, i.e., shorter than a suggested phonon
bottleneck, to $\sim 200\pm20$ fs, with an average value of $80 \pm 25$ fs,
similar to results from previous studies on polycrystalline thin films. The
variation is uncorrelated with crystal size, orientation, transition
temperature, and initial insulating phase. This together with details of the
nano-domain behavior during the thermally-induced IMT suggests a significant
sensitivity to local variations in, e.g., doping, defects, and strain of the
microcrystals. The combination of results points to an electronic mechanism
dominating the photoinduced IMT in VO$_2$, but also highlights the difficulty
of deducing mechanistic information where the intrinsic response in correlated

caused by the trispectrum, and a 'knee' in the presence of white noise. The
effective number of Fourier modes, normally growing as a power law, is bounded
from above by these plateaux, explaining naturally earlier findings from
$N$-body simulations. These plateaux limit best possible measurements of the
nonlinear power at the percent level in a $h^{-3}\textrm{Gpc}^3$ volume; the
extraction of model parameters from the spectrum is limited explicitly by their
degeneracy to the nonlinear amplitude. The value of the first, super-survey
(SS) plateau depends on the characteristic survey volume and the large scale
power; the second, intra-survey (IS) plateau is set by the small scale power.
While both have simple interpretations within the hierarchical \textit{Ansatz},
the SS plateau can be predicted and generalized to still smaller scales within
Takada and Hu's spectrum response formalism. Finally, the noise knee is
naturally set by the density of tracers.

  Theory",,,,,"cs.IT math.IT math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Recently, the 1-bit compressive sensing (1-bit CS) has been studied in the
field of sparse signal recovery. Since the amplitude information of sparse
signals in 1-bit CS is not available, it is often the support or the sign of a
signal that can be exactly recovered with a decoding method. In this paper, we
first show that a necessary assumption (that has been overlooked in the
literature) should be made for some existing theories and discussions for 1-bit
CS. Without such an assumption, the found solution by some existing decoding
algorithms might be inconsistent with 1-bit measurements. This motivates us to
pursue a new direction to develop uniform and nonuniform recovery theories for
1-bit CS with a new decoding method which always generates a solution
consistent with 1-bit measurements. We focus on an extreme case of 1-bit CS, in
which the measurements capture only the sign of the product of a sensing matrix
and a signal. We show that the 1-bit CS model can be reformulated equivalently
as an $\ell_0$-minimization problem with linear constraints. This reformulation
naturally leads to a new linear-program-based decoding method, referred to as
the 1-bit basis pursuit, which is remarkably different from existing
formulations. It turns out that the uniqueness condition for the solution of
the 1-bit basis pursuit yields the so-called restricted range space property
(RRSP) of the transposed sensing matrix. This concept provides a basis to
develop sign recovery conditions for sparse signals through 1-bit measurements.
We prove that if the sign of a sparse signal can be exactly recovered from
1-bit measurements with 1-bit basis pursuit, then the sensing matrix must admit
a certain RRSP, and that if the sensing matrix admits a slightly enhanced RRSP,
then the sign of a $k$-sparse signal can be exactly recovered with 1-bit basis
pursuit.

radiation pressure of the photons [1,2] is a promising platform for
investigations of quantum mechanical properties of motion of macroscopic bodies
and thereby the limits of quantum mechanics [3,4]. A drawback is that the
effect of one photon tends to be tiny, and hence one of the pressing challenges
is to substantially increase the interaction strength towards the scale of the
cavity damping rate. A novel scenario is to introduce into the setup a quantum
two-level system (qubit), which, besides strengthening the coupling, allows for
rich physics via strongly enhanced nonlinearities [5-8]. Addressing these
issues, here we present a design of cavity optomechanics in the microwave
frequency regime involving a Josephson junction qubit. We demonstrate boosting
of the radiation pressure interaction energy by six orders of magnitude,
allowing to approach the strong coupling regime, where a single quantum of
vibrations shifts the cavity frequency by more than its linewidth. We observe
nonlinear phenomena at single-photon energies, such as an enhanced damping due
to the two-level system. This work opens up nonlinear cavity optomechanics as a
plausible tool for the study of quantum properties of motion.

change field equations in the bulk, but affects the system behaviour when it is
bounded. When two of those $\theta$-systems, each one characterized by a
different value of $\theta$ (even zero), share a common boundary, surface
effects are then induced by a CS $\theta$ term. Here, we study the consequences
of the above in the propagation of electromagnetic radiation in
$\theta$-systems. In a previous paper, electromagnetic radiation properties
traversing a $\theta$-vacuum were analyzed where a number of interesting
features arise related to polarization and energy distribution. Now, we
investigate how electric and magnetic properties of the $\theta$-system affect
the optical response. Apart from the well-known Kerr polarization rotation
found for the particular case of topological insulators, we examine in detail
the issue and the results could be applied in other contexts where
$\theta$-term accounts for the system dynamics. In particular, we find two
different Brewster angles, for $s$ and $p$ polarization of reflected radiation,
respectively, with peculiar features derived from the $\theta$ term influence.
Possible applications of these results are discussed.

gas-phase chemistry to the dust nucleation and condensation phases. We consider
two supernova progenitor masses with homogeneous and clumpy ejecta to assess
the chemical type and quantity of dust that forms. Grain size distributions are
derived as a function of post-explosion time. Methods: The chemistry of the gas
phase and the simultaneous formation of dust clusters are described by a
chemical network. The formation of key species (CO, SiO) and dust clusters of
silicates, alumina, silica, metal carbides and sulphides, pure metals, and
amorphous carbon is considered. The master equations describing the chemistry
of the nucleation phase are coupled to a dust condensation formalism based on
Brownian coagulation. Results: Type II-P supernovae produce dust grains of
various chemical compositions and size distributions as a function of time. The
grain size distributions gain in complexity with time, are slewed towards large
grains, and differ from the usual MRN power-law distribution used for
interstellar dust. Gas density enhancements in the form of clumps strongly
affect the dust chemical composition and the grain size distributions.
Silicates and pure metallic grains are highly dependent on clumpiness.
Specifically, clumpy ejecta produce grains over 0.1 micron, and the final dust
mass reaches 0.14 Msun. Conversely, carbon and alumina dust masses are
controlled by the mass yields of alumina and carbon in the zones where the dust
is produced. Several dust components form in the ejecta and the total dust mass
gradually builds up over a time span of 3 to 5 years post-outburst. This
gradual growth provides a possible explanation for the discrepancy between the
small dust masses formed at early post-explosion times and the high dust masses
derived from recent observations of supernova remnants.

the Koslowski-Sahlmann (KS) representation. The KS representation is a
generalization of the representation underlying Loop Quantum Gravity (LQG)
which supports, in addition to the usual LQG operators, the action of
`background exponential operators' which are connection dependent operators
labelled by `background' $su(2)$ electric fields. KS states have, in addition
to the LQG state label corresponding to 1 dimensional excitations of the triad,
a label corresponding to a `background' electric field which describes 3
dimensional excitations of the triad. Asymptotic behaviour in quantum theory is
controlled through asymptotic conditions on the background electric fields
which label the {\em states} and the background electric fields which label the
{\em operators}. Asymptotic conditions on the triad are imposed as conditions
on the background electric field state label while confining the LQG spin net
graph labels to compact sets. We show that KS states can be realised as wave
functions on a quantum configuration space of generalized connections and that
the asymptotic behaviour of each such generalized connection is determined by
that of the background electric fields which label the background exponential
operators. Similar to the spatially compact case, the Gauss Law and
diffeomorphism constraints are then imposed through Group Averaging techniques
to obtain a large sector of gauge invariant states. It is shown that this
sector supports a unitary action of the group of asymptotic rotations and
translations and that, as anticipated by Friedman and Sorkin, for appropriate
spatial topology, this sector contains states which display fermionic behaviour
under $2\pi$ rotations.

when the spectral template model underlying the lightcurve fitter poorly
represents the actual supernova spectral energy distribution, meaning that the
distance modulus cannot be recovered accurately. In order to quantify this
effect, synthetic photometry is performed on artificially redshifted
spectrophotometric data from 119 low-redshift supernovae from the Nearby
Supernova Factory, and the resulting lightcurves are fit with a conventional
lightcurve fitter. We measure the variation in the standardized magnitude that
would be fit for a given supernova if located at a range of redshifts and
observed with various filter sets corresponding to current and future supernova
surveys. We find significant variation in the measurements of the same
supernovae placed at different redshifts regardless of filters used, which
causes dispersion greater than $\sim0.05$ mag for measurements of photometry
using the Sloan-like filters and a bias that corresponds to a $0.03$ shift in
$w$ when applied to an outside data set. To test the result of a shift in
supernova population or environment at higher redshifts, we repeat our
calculations with the addition of a reweighting of the supernovae as a function

of 21% and 42% particle concentrations and particle-coated drops are studied,

The relative velocities studied span the transition to splashing, and both
wetting/miscible and non-wetting/immiscible cases are considered. Impacts
normal to the surface and head-on collisions are studied and compared. In
surface impact, the behavior of low-density suspensions and liquid marble drops
is qualitatively similar to that of pure liquid, while the concentrated drops
are solid-like on impact. Collisions produce a splash only at velocities
signif- icantly higher than in impact, but the resulting drop morphology shows
a similar dependence on solid concentration as in impact. In all cases the
collision or impact produces a strong local enhancement in the kinetic energy
density and temperature but not in the particle or potential energy densities.
Mixing of the two colliding species is not enhanced by collisions, unless the

important themes capture the spirit of the workshop submissions and
discussions: (1) organizational stakeholders, especially supercomputer centers,
are in a unique position to promote, enable, and support reproducible research;
and (2) individual researchers should conduct each experiment as though someone
will replicate that experiment. Participants documented numerous issues,
questions, technologies, practices, and potentially promising initiatives
emerging from the discussion, but also highlighted four areas of particular
interest to XSEDE: (1) documentation and training that promotes reproducible
research; (2) system-level tools that provide build- and run-time information
at the level of the individual job; (3) the need to model best practices in
research collaborations involving XSEDE staff; and (4) continued work on
gateways and related technologies. In addition, an intriguing question emerged
from the day's interactions: would there be value in establishing an annual
award for excellence in reproducible research?

Pooling information across individuals can increase the power of detecting

fluctuations to probe sources at 10<z<30 from a JWST/NIRCam configuration that
will isolate known galaxies to 28 AB mag at 0.5--5 micron. At present
significant mutually consistent source-subtracted CIB fluctuations have been
identified in the Spitzer and Akari data at 2--5 micron, but we demonstrate
internal inconsistencies at shorter wavelengths in the recent CIBER data. We
evaluate CIB contributions from remaining galaxies and show that the bulk of
the high-z sources will be in the confusion noise of the NIRCam beam, requiring
CIB studies. The accurate measurement of the angular spectrum of the
fluctuations and probing the dependence of its clustering component on the
remaining shot noise power would discriminate between the various currently
proposed models for their origin and probe the flux distribution of its
sources. We show that the contribution to CIB fluctuations from remaining
galaxies is large at visible wavelengths for the current instruments precluding
probing the putative Lyman-break of the CIB fluctuations. We demonstrate that
with the proposed JWST configuration such measurements will enable probing the
Lyman break. We develop a Lyman-break tomography method to use the NIRCam
wavelength coverage to identify or constrain, via the adjacent two-band
subtraction, the history of emissions over 10<z<30 as the Universe comes out of
the 'Dark Ages'. We apply the proposed tomography to the current Spitzer/IRAC
measurements at 3.6 and 4.5 micron, to find that it already leads to
interestingly low upper limit on emissions at z>30.

well as a set of novel data synthesis techniques that allow us to efficiently
obtain a large amount of varied data for training. Our system, called Deep

real-world topology configurations with realistic communication traffic based

delay and system reliability, the impacts of aggregating all traffic on a
low-capacity wireless link based on Digital Mobile Radio (DMR) when a Long Term

their impacts on all smart grid perspectives in an automated manner. Even more
importantly, multi-simulation can prevent problems before modifying/upgrading a
smart grid and thus potentially reduce utility costs.

locked rocky exoplanets but remains understudied. Here, general results on the
heat transport and stability of tidally locked terrestrial-type atmospheres are
reported. First, the problem is modeled with an idealized 3D general
circulation model (GCM) with gray gas radiative transfer. It is shown that over
a wide range of parameters the atmospheric boundary layer, rather than the
large-scale circulation, is the key to understanding the planetary energy
balance. Through a scaling analysis of the interhemispheric energy transfer,
theoretical expressions for the day-night temperature difference and surface
wind speed are created that reproduce the GCM results without tuning. Next, the
GCM is used with correlated-k radiative transfer to study heat transport for
two real gases (CO2 and CO). For CO2, empirical formulae for the collapse
pressure as a function of planetary mass and stellar flux are produced, and
critical pressures for atmospheric collapse at Earth's stellar flux are
obtained that are around five times higher (0.14 bar) than previous gray gas
estimates. These results provide constraints on atmospheric stability that will
aid in future interpretation of observations and exoplanet habitability
modeling.

bring electrical signals from the back side of the trap die to the surface trap
structure on the top side. Gold-ball bump bonds connect the back side of the
trap die to an interposer for signal routing from the carrier. Trench
capacitors fabricated into the trap die replace area-intensive surface or edge
capacitors. Wirebonds in the BGA architecture are moved to the interposer.
These last two features allow the trap die to be reduced to only the area
required to produce trapping fields. The smaller trap dimensions allow tight
focusing of an addressing laser beam for fast single-qubit rotations.
Performance of the BGA trap as characterized with $^{40}$Ca$^+$ ions is
comparable to previous surface-electrode traps in terms of ion heating rate,
mode frequency stability, and storage lifetime. We demonstrate two-qubit

particular cases. On the other hand, our test may provide the first opportunity
to test the unitarity of a right-handed quark mixing matrix and with 3000/fb
severely constrains possible departures from unitarity in the latter. We refine
our previous work, testing the equality of quark mixing matrices, with full
collider simulation. With 20/fb, we are sensitive to mixing angles as small as
$30^\circ$, and with 3000/fb, angles as small as $7.5^\circ$, confirming our
preliminary analysis. We briefly investigate testing the unitarity of the SM
CKM matrix with a similar method by studying semileptonic $t\bar t$ production,
concluding that systematics make it particularly difficult.

the merger of a neutron star (NS) and a black hole (BH). Our focus is the
interplay between material ejected dynamically during the merger, and the wind
launched on a viscous timescale by the remnant accretion disk. These components
are expected to contribute to an electromagnetic transient and to produce
r-process elements, each with a different signature when considered separately.
Here we introduce a two-step approach to investigate their combined evolution,
using two- and three-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations. Starting from the
output of a merger simulation, we identify each component in the initial
condition based on its phase space distribution, and evolve the accretion disk
in axisymmetry. The wind blown from this disk is injected into a
three-dimensional computational domain where the dynamical ejecta is evolved.
We find that the wind can suppress fallback accretion on timescales longer than
~100 ms. Due to self-similar viscous evolution, the disk accretion at late
times nevertheless approaches a power-law time dependence $\propto t^{-2.2}$.
This can power some late-time GRB engine activity, although the available
energy is significantly less than in traditional fallback models. Inclusion of
radioactive heating due to the r-process does not significantly affect the
fallback accretion rate or the disk wind. We do not find any significant
modification to the wind properties at large radius due to interaction with the
dynamical ejecta. This is a consequence of the different expansion velocities
of the two components.

We demonstrate that a large degree of asymmetry develops over time from tiny
fluctuations superposed upon planar and SO(2,1) symmetric backgrounds. These
fluctuations arise from zero-point vacuum oscillations, so excluding them by
enforcing a spatial symmetry is inconsistent in a quantum treatment. We
consider the limit of two colliding planar walls, with fluctuation mode
functions characterized by the wavenumber transverse to the collision direction
and a longitudinal shape along the collision direction $x$, which we solve for.
Initially, the fluctuations obey a linear wave equation with a time- and
space-dependent mass $m_{eff}(x,t)$. When the walls collide multiple times,
$m_{eff}$ oscillates in time. We use Floquet theory to study the fluctuations
and generalize techniques familiar from preheating to the case with many
coupled degrees of freedom. This inhomogeneous case has bands of unstable
transverse wavenumbers $k_\perp$ with exponentially growing mode functions.
From the detailed spatial structure of the mode functions in $x$, we identify
both broad and narrow parametric resonance generalizations of the homogeneous
$m_{eff}(t)$ case of preheating. The unstable $k_\perp$ modes are
longitudinally localized, yet can be described as quasiparticles in the
Bogoliubov sense. We define an effective occupation number to show they are
created in bursts for the case of well-defined collisions in the background.
The transverse-longitudinal coupling accompanying nonlinearity radically breaks

Motivated by the fact that in extragalaxies the supermassive black holes with
similar masses and near-Eddington luminosities are usually strong X-ray
emitters, we calculate here the X-ray luminosity of SgrA*. For that, we assume
that the outburst was due to accretion of gas or the tidal disruption of a

$h\nu>2~{\rm keV}$) flux comparable to that from the current quiescent sun. The
flux in harder energy band $20~{\rm keV}<h\nu<100~{\rm keV}$, however,
surpasses that from an X-class solar flare, and the irradiation timescale is
also much longer, ranging from weeks to $10^5$ years depending on the outburst
scenario. In the solar system gas giants will suffer the biggest impact in
their atmospheres. Lower-mass planets such as Earth receive a level of
radiation that might have played a role in the evolution of their primitive

cross-correlations offer a tool with which to study the ICM over a wide range

cross-correlation is more sensitive to gas in lower-mass, higher-redshift halos
and gas at larger cluster-centric radii than the tSZ - galaxy lensing
cross-correlation. Combining these measurements with primary CMB data will
constrain feedback models through their signatures in the ICM pressure profile.
We forecast the ability of ongoing and future experiments to constrain such ICM
parameters, including the mean amplitude of the pressure - mass relation, the
redshift evolution of this amplitude, and the mean outer logarithmic slope of
the pressure profile. The results are promising, with $\approx 5-20$% precision

tenuous debris disk comprised of planetesimals and dust, as well as possibly
gas and planets. This paper uses the properties of 10-20Myr A star debris disks
to consider the protoplanetary to debris disk transition. The physical
distinction between these two classes is argued to rest on the presence of
primordial gas in sufficient quantities to dominate the motion of small dust
grains (not the secondary nature of the dust or its level of stirring). This
motivates an observational classification based on the dust spectrum,
empirically defined so that A star debris disks require fractional excesses <3
at 12um and <2000 at 70um. We also propose a hypothesis to test, that the main
sequence planet/planetesimal structures are already in place (but obscured)
during the protoplanetary disk phase. This may be only weakly true if planetary
architectures change until frozen during disk dispersal, or completely false if
planets and planetesimals form during disk dispersal. Five steps in the
transition are discussed: (i) carving an inner hole to form a transition disk;
(ii) depletion of mm-sized dust in outer disk, noting the importance of
determining whether this mass ends up in planetesimals or is collisionally
depleted; (iii) final clearing of inner regions, noting that many mechanisms
replenish moderate hot dust levels at later phases, and likely also operate in
protoplanetary disks; (iv) disappearence of gas, noting recent discoveries of
primordial and secondary gas in debris disks that highlight our ignorance and
its impending enlightenment by ALMA; (v) formation of ring-like planetesimal

particular when we take into account massive modes associated with symmetry
breaking, whose masses are not necessarily high. We also revisit the coset

Maurer-Cartan one form and connections for spacetime symmetries, we classify
the physical meanings of the inverse Higgs constraints by the coordinate

symmetries with a higher dimension remove the redundant NG fields, whereas
those for dimensionless symmetries can be further classified by the local

ground states of gapped, local Hamiltonians in which global characteristics of
a quantum state are encoded in properties of local tensors. We develop a
framework to describe on-site symmetries, as occurring in systems exhibiting
symmetry-protected topological (SPT) quantum order, in terms of virtual
symmetries of the local tensors expressed as a set of matrix product operators
(MPOs) labeled by distinct group elements. These MPOs describe the possibly
anomalous symmetry of the edge theory, whose local degrees of freedom are
concretely identified in a PEPS. A classification of SPT phases is obtained by
studying the obstructions to continuously deforming one set of MPOs into
another, recovering the results derived for fixed-point models [X. Chen et al.,
Phys. Rev. B 87, 155114 (2013)]. Our formalism accommodates perturbations away
from fixed point models, opening the possibility of studying phase transitions
between different SPT phases. We also demonstrate that applying the recently
developed quantum state gauging procedure to a SPT PEPS yields a PEPS with
topological order determined by the initial symmetry MPOs. The MPO framework
thus unifies the different approaches to classifying SPT phases, via
fixed-points models, boundary anomalies, or gauging the symmetry, into the
single problem of classifying inequivalent sets of matrix product operator
symmetries that are defined purely in terms of a PEPS.

the sense that the evolution of local expectation values approach a stationary
value resembling a thermal ensemble. This intuition is notably contradicted in
systems exhibiting many-body localisation, a phenomenon receiving significant
recent attention. One of its most intriguing features is that, in stark
contrast to the non-interacting case, entanglement of states grows without
limit over time, albeit slowly. In this work, we establish a novel link between
quantum information theory and notions of condensed matter, capturing the
phenomenon in the Heisenberg picture. We show that the existence of local
constants of motion, often taken as the defining property of many-body
localisation, together with a generic spectrum, is sufficient to rigorously
prove information propagation: These systems can be used to send a signal over
arbitrary distances, in that the impact of a local perturbation can be detected
arbitrarily far away. We perform a detailed perturbation analysis of
quasi-local constants of motion and also show that they indeed can be used to
construct efficient spectral tensor networks, as recently suggested. Our
results provide a detailed and model-independent picture of information
propagation in many-body localised systems.

spectrum and bispectrum generated during a stage of single field cosmic
inflation. We argue that there are two main classes of features: those produced
by a sudden time variation of the sound speed of curvature perturbations, and
those produced by a sudden change in the expansion rate during inflation. The
former are known to be produced by heavy fields, when the inflationary
background trajectory in field space undergoes a bend, whereas the latter are
known to be produced by features in the inflaton potential encountered as the
inflaton field descends its slope. In general, features are expected to be the
result of these two sources combined, however, it is possible that one source
dominated over the other, resulting in a distinctive pattern that may be
observationally tested. We deduce a relation that gives us the shape of
features in the bispectrum provided that we know the shape of features in the
power spectrum, and show that each one of these two classes of features leaves
a particular footprint in the distribution of perturbations that could be

  The main contribution of this paper is to identify how heterogeneous noise
impacts performance. We show that given two datasets with heterogeneous noise,
the order in which to use them in standard SGD depends on the learning rate. We
propose a method for changing the learning rate as a function of the

from measurements of complex networks and information theory. For this, it is
considered the nucleotides, dinucleotides and trinucleotides of a genomic
sequence. For each of them, the entropy, sum entropy and maximum entropy values
are calculated.For each of them is also generated a network, in which the nodes
are the nucleotides, dinucleotides or trinucleotides and its edges are
estimated by observing the respective adjacency among them in the genomic
sequence. In this way, it is generated three networks, for which measures of
complex networks are extracted.These measures together with measures of
information theory comprise a feature vector representing a genomic sequence.
Thus, the feature vector is used for classification by methods such as SVM,
MultiLayer Perceptron, J48, IBK, Naive Bayes and Random Forest in order to
evaluate the proposed approach.It was adopted coding sequences, intergenic
sequences and TSS (Transcriptional Starter Sites) as datasets, for which the
better results were obtained by the Random Forest with 91.2%, followed by J48
with 89.1% and SVM with 84.8% of accuracy. These results indicate that the new

We find that: 1. The least-biased classification method of GRBs into short and
long, solely based on prompt-emission properties, appears to be the ratio of
the observed spectral peak energy to the observed duration ($R=E_p/T_{90}$)
with the dividing line at $R\simeq50[keV~s^{-1}]$. 2. Once data is carefully
corrected for the effects of the detection threshold of gamma-ray instruments,
the population distribution of SGRBs and LGRBs can be individually well
described as multivariate log-normal distribution in the $4$--dimensional space
of the isotropic peak gamma-ray luminosity, total isotropic gamma-ray emission,
the intrinsic spectral peak energy, and the intrinsic duration. 3. Relatively
large fractions of SGRBs and LGRBs with moderate-to-low spectral peak energies
have been missed by BATSE detectors. 4. Relatively strong and highly
significant intrinsic hardness--brightness and duration--brightness
correlations likely exist in both populations of SGRBs and LGRBs, once data is
corrected for selection effects. The strengths of these correlations are very
similar in both populations, implying similar mechanisms at work in both GRB

the extreme accretion within ULXs. We will both investigate in detail known
sources and research new and fainter ones. When we have reached a thorough

framework for reasoning under conditions of uncertainty. The main contribution
of this discussion is to emphasize the pragmatic elements in the derivation.
More specifically: (1) Probability theory is designed as the uniquely natural
tool for representing states of incomplete information. (2) An epistemic notion
of information is defined in terms of its relation to the Bayesian beliefs of
ideally rational agents. (3) The method of updating from a prior to a posterior
probability distribution is designed through an eliminative induction process
that singles out the logarithmic relative entropy as the unique tool for
inference. The resulting framework includes as special cases both MaxEnt and
Bayes' rule. It therefore unifies entropic and Bayesian methods into a single

associated to an emergent scalar field dual to the deforming operator. We
generalize to arbitrary spatially dependent couplings where a linearized metric
emerges naturally as a way of efficiently encoding the field theory
entanglement: by demanding that Einstein's equations coupled to the bulk scalar
field are satisfied, we show that EE can be calculated as the area of this

gravitational theory from any CFT, it allows for effective evaluation of the
the integrals required to calculate EE perturbativly. Our results can also be

Faraday-rotation structures along the projected trajectory of Sh 2-174,
including a high-contrast structure with ""arms"" that run precisely along the

downstream edge of Sh 2-174. The high-contrast structure is consistent with an
ionized tail which has both early-epoch (before Sh 2-174 entered the cloud) and
present-epoch (after Sh 2-174 entered the cloud) components. Furthermore, our
rotation-measure analysis indicates that the ISM magnetic field is deflected at
the leading edge of Sh 2-174. The downstream tail and upstream field deflection
point to a PN-ISM interaction. Our estimated space velocity for the host white

brightest cluster galaxy (BCG) is radio loud, showing non-thermal radio jets

such relativistic plasma has been unambiguously shown to interact with the
surrounding thermal intra-cluster medium (ICM) thanks to spectacular images
where the lobe radio emission is observed to fill the cavities in the
X-ray-emitting gas. This `radio feedback' phenomenon is widespread and is
critical to understand the physics of the inner regions of galaxy clusters and
the properties of the central BCG. At the same time, mechanically-powerful AGN
are likely to drive turbulence in the central ICM which may also play a role
for the origin of non-thermal emission on cluster-scales. Diffuse non-thermal
emission has been observed in a number of cool-core clusters in the form of a
radio mini-halo surrounding the radio-loud BCG on scales comparable to that of
the cooling region. Large mini-halo samples are necessary to establish their

validation of a cosmological model that can explain the phenomenon of the
accelerated expansion of the Universe. This problem is an open discussion topic
in modern physics. One of the most common approaches is that of the ""Dark
Energy"" (DE), a matter component still unknown, with repulsive character (to
explain the accelerated expansion), which fills about 2/3 of the total content
of the Universe. In this thesis are investigated two cosmological models, a
non-minimally coupled quintessence field, based on a Scalar-Tensor Theory of
gravity, formulated in the Einstein's frame, and a quintom dark energy model,
based on General Relativity. A normalization and parametrization procedure is
introduced for each model, in order to investigate the flow properties of an
associated autonomous system of ordinary differential equations. In our study
are combined topological, analytical and numerical techniques. We are mainly
interested in the past dynamics. However, some results concerning the
intermediate and future dynamics are discussed. The mathematical results
obtained have an immediate interpretation in the cosmological context.

matrix of degrees, $L' = D - A$ is the combinatorial Laplacian, and $L =
D^{-1/2}L'D^{-1/2}$ is the normalized Laplacian. Recently, the eigenvectors
corresponding to the smallest eigenvalues of $L$ and $L'$ have been of great
interest because of their application to community detection, which is a
nebulously defined problem that essentially seeks to find a vertex set $S$ such
that there are few edges incident with exactly one vertex of $S$. The
connection between community detection and the second smallest eigenvalue (and
the corresponding eigenvector) is well-known. The $k$ smallest eigenvalues have
been used heuristically to find multiple communities in the same graph, and a
justification with theoretical rigor for the use of $k \geq 3$ eigenpairs has
only been found very recently.
  The largest eigenpair of $L$ has been used more classically to solve the
MAX-CUT problem, which seeks to find a vertex set $S$ that maximizes the number
of edges incident with exactly one vertex of $S$. Very recently Trevisan
presented a connection between the largest eigenvalue of $L$ and a recursive
approach to the MAX-CUT problem that seeks to find a ""bipartite community"" at
each stage. This is related to Kleinberg's HITS algorithm that finds the
largest eigenvalue of $A^TA$. We will provide a justification with theoretical
rigor for looking at the $k$ largest eigenvalues of $L$ to find multiple
bipartite communities in the same graph, and then provide a heuristic algorithm
to find strong bipartite communities that is based on the intuition developed
by the theoretical methods. Finally, we will present the results of applying
our algorithm to various data-mining problems.

properties of tailored electronic elements. In this work, we focus our
attention on two classes of organic switches connected to carbon-nanotube leads
and operating due to photo- or field-induced proton transfer (PT) process. By
means of the first-principles atomistic simulations of the ballistic
conductance, we search for atomic contacts which strengthen diversity of the
two swapped I-V characteristics between two tautomers of a given molecular
system. We emphasize, that the low-resistive character of the contacts is not
necessarily in accordance with the switching properties. Very often, the
higher-current flow makes it more difficult to distinguish between the logic
states of the molecular device. Instead, the resistive contacts multiply a
current gear at the tautomeric transition to a larger extent. The low- and
high-bias work regimes set additional conditions, which are fulfilled by
different contacts. In some cases, the peroxide contacts or the direct
connection to the tube perform better than the popular sulfur contact.
Additionally, we find that the switching-bias value is not an inherent property
of the conducting molecule, but it strongly depends on the chosen contacts.

However, automatically identifying discourse relations is difficult, because it

challenge is that it is not enough to represent the meaning of each sentence of

lower-level elements, such as entity mentions. Our solution computes
distributional meaning representations by composition up the syntactic parse

novel downward compositional pass. Discourse relations are predicted not only
from the distributional representations of the sentences, but also of their

During the 9 days of observations, K2 observed a single transit event. Using a
new K2 photometric analysis technique we are able to correct small telescope
drifts and recover the observed transit at high confidence, corresponding to a
planetary radius of Rp = 2.53 +/- 0.18 Rearth. Radial velocity observations
with the HARPS-N spectrograph reveal a 11.82 +/- 1.33 Mearth planet in a 9.1

Follow-up photometric measurements from the MOST satellite confirm the transit
observed in the K2 photometry and provide a refined ephemeris, making HIP

the growing population of transiting super-Earths around nearby, bright stars.

advantage over traditional $\sim$1.4 GHz surveys as they are able to yield
higher angular resolution imaging while probing higher rest frame frequencies

becomes dominated by thermal (free-free) radiation. In doing so, surveys

diagnostic requires that Band~5 be available for SKA1-MID. We additionally
present a detailed science case for frequency coverage extending up to 30 GHz

additionally providing contiguous frequency coverage between the SKA and ALMA,

to give rise to shocks that can accelerate cosmic rays. This process then
results in an isotropic extragalactic gamma-ray emission contributing to the
extragalactic gamma-ray background observed by the Fermi-LAT. Unfortunately
this emission has been difficult to constrain and thus presents an uncertain
foreground to any attempts to extract potential dark matter signal. Recently,
IceCube has detected high-energy isotropic neutrino flux which could be of an
extragalactic origin. In general, neutrinos can be linked to gamma rays since
cosmic-ray interactions produce neutral and charged pions where neutral pions
decay into gamma rays, while charged pions decay to give neutrinos. By assuming
that isotropic high-energy IceCube neutrinos are entirely produced by cosmic
rays accelerated in accretion shocks during the process of structure formation,
we obtain the strongest constraint to the gamma-ray emission from large scale
structure formation (strong) shocks and find that they can make at best ~20% of
the extragalactic gamma-ray background, corresponding to neutrino flux with
spectral index 2, or ~10% for spectral index 2.46. Since typical objects where
cosmic rays are accelerated in accretion shocks are galaxy clusters, observed
high-energy neutrino fluxes can then be used to determine the gamma-ray
emission of a dominant cluster type and constrain acceleration efficiency, and
thus probe the process of large scale structure formation.

modelling of this mechanism, using the methods first introduced by Montgomery
(2005), yields a time-averaged convective response time of tau_0 ~ 150 s for
the star, and this is shown to be broadly consistent with a MLT/alpha parameter
value between 0.8 and 1.2. It is argued that for the DBV pulsators the measured
value of tau_0 is a better estimate of the relative stellar surface
temperatures than those obtained via spectroscopic techniques.

pulse with a sharp rise-time is analyzed and the frequency range that carries
most of the pulse energy is identified. A genetic algorithm is used to maximize
the stop bands of a layered periodic composite over the target frequency range.
Due to reflection of the pulse over the stop bands, the maximum stress and the
energy of transmitted pulse become minimal. To verify the theoretical
calculation a sample is fabricated and Hopkinson bar experiments are performed.
It is observed that only 9.7% of energy of the incident pulse gets transmitted

be 45.4% less than the wave speed in its constituent material with the lowest

describe spectra: the width of the $EF_E$ spectrum, a quantity dependent only
on finding a good fit to the data. We apply this to the full sample of GRBs
observed by Fermi/GBM and CGRO/BATSE. The results from the two instruments are
fully consistent. We find that the median widths of spectra from long and short
GRBs are significantly different (chance probability $<10^{-6}$). The width
does not correlate with either duration or hardness, and this is thus a new,
independent distinction between the two classes. Comparing the measured spectra
with widths of spectra from fundamental emission processes -- synchrotron and
blackbody radiation -- the results indicate that a large fraction of GRB
spectra are too narrow to be explained by synchrotron radiation from a
distribution of electron energies: for example, 78% of long GRBs and 85% of
short GRBs are incompatible with the minimum width of standard slow cooling
synchrotron emission from a Maxwellian distribution of electrons, with fast
cooling spectra predicting even wider spectra. Photospheric emission can
explain the spectra if mechanisms are invoked to give a spectrum much broader

different ways in which the energetic needs of the brain are met. In this paper
we address the problem within a steady state framework and we use the
techniques of linear algebra to identify the degrees of freedom first in a
lumped model, then in its extension to a spatially distributed case. The
interpretation of the degrees of freedom in metabolic terms, more specifically
in terms of glucose and oxygen partitioning, is then leveraged to derive
constraints on the free parameters needed to guarantee that the model is
energetically feasible. We also demonstrate how the model can be used to
estimate the stoichiometric energy needs of the cells as well as the household
energy based on observed oxidative cerebral metabolic rate (CMR) of glucose,
and the glutamate cycling. Moreover, our analysis shows that in the lumped
model the direction of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) in the cells can be deduced
from the glucose partitioning between the compartments. The extension of the
lumped model into a spatially distributed multi-compartment setting that
includes diffusion fluxes from capillary to tissue increases the number of
degrees of freedom, requiring the use of statistical sampling techniques. The
analysis of distributed model reveals that some of the conclusions, e.g.,
concerning the LDH activity and glucose partitioning, based on a spatially
lumped model may no longer hold.

assumptions, with optimal time and memory complexity of ${\cal O}(K)$. It is
known that the fundamental limit for the number of measurements in compressive

the first constructive capacity-approaching compressive phase retrieval
algorithm. As a second contribution, we propose another variant of the
PhaseCode algorithm that is based on a Compressive Sensing framework involving
sparse-graph codes. Our proposed algorithm is an instance of a more powerful
""separation"" architecture that can be used to address the compressive
phase-retrieval problem in general. This modular design features a compressive
sensing outer layer, and a trigonometric-based phase-retrieval inner layer. The
compressive-sensing layer operates as a linear phase-aware compressive
measurement subsystem, while the trig-based phase-retrieval layer provides the
desired abstraction between the actually targeted nonlinear phase-retrieval
problem and the induced linear compressive-sensing problem. Invoking this

instability in isobarically contracting gas with various metallicities and FUV
field strengths. When the H2 cooling is suppressed by FUV fields (G_0>10^-3) or
the metallicity is high enough (Z/Zs>10^-3), the interstellar medium is
thermally unstable in the temperature range 100-7000 K owing to the cooling by
CII and OI fine-structure lines. In this case, a bi-phasic medium with a
bimodal density probability distribution is formed as a consequence of the
thermal instability. The characteristic scales of the thermal instability
become smaller with increasing metallicity. Comparisons of the nonlinear
simulations with different resolution indicates that the maximum scale of the
thermal instability should be resolved with more than 60 cells to follow
runaway cooling driven by the thermal instability. Under sufficiently weak FUV
fields and with low metallcity, the density range of the thermal instability
shrinks owing to dominance of H2 cooling. As the FUV intensity is reduced,
bi-phasic structure becomes less remarkable and disappears eventually. Our
basic results suggest that, in early galaxies, i) the thermal instability has
little effect for the medium with Z/Zs<10^-4, ii) fragmentation by the thermal
instability could determine mass spectrum of star clusters for 10^-4<Z/Zs<0.04,
and iii) thermally bistable turbulent interstellar medium like our galaxy
becomes ubiquitous for Z/Zs>0.04, although the threshold metallicity depends on
the conditions such as thermal pressure, FUV strength and redshift.

understanding of the non-classical behavior of Kerr optical frequency combs
when pumped below and above threshold. In the configuration where the system is
under threshold, the pump field is the unique oscillating mode inside the
resonator, and triggers the phenomenon of spontaneous four-wave mixing, where
two photons from the pump are symmetrically up- and down-converted in the
Fourier domain. This phenomenon can only be understood and analyzed from a
fully quantum perspective as a consequence of the coupling between the field of
the central (pumped) mode and the vacuum fluctuations of the various sidemodes.
We analytically calculate the power spectra of the spontaneous emission noise,
and we show that these spectra can be either single- or double peaked depending
on the parameters of the system. We also calculate as well the overall
spontaneous noise power per sidemode, and propose simplified analytical
expressions for some particular cases. In the configuration where the system is
pumped above threshold, we investigate the phenomena of quantum correlations
and multimode squeezed states of light that can occur in the Kerr frequency
combs originating from stimulated four-wave mixing. We show that for all
stationary spatio-temporal patterns, the side-modes that are symmetrical
relatively to the pumped mode in the frequency domain display quantum
correlations that can lead to squeezed states of light. We also explicitly
determine the phase quadratures leading to photon entanglement, and
analytically calculate their quantum noise spectra. We finally discuss the
relevance of Kerr combs for quantum information systems at optical

several Universe models. In chapter 1 we give a bird's eye view on cosmology
and cosmological problems. Chapter 2 is devoted to a brief review on some
results and useful tools from the qualitative theory of dynamical systems. They
provide the theoretical basis for the qualitative study of concrete
cosmological models. Chapters 1 and 2 are a review of well-known results.
Chapters 3, 4, 5 and 6 are devoted to our main results. In these chapters are
extended and settled in a substantially different, more strict mathematical
language, several results obtained by one of us in arXiv:0812.1013 [gr-qc];
arXiv:1009.0689 [gr-qc]; arXiv:0904.1577[gr-qc]; and arXiv:0909.3571 [hep-th].
In chapter 6, we provide a different approach to the subject discussed in
astro-ph/0503478. Additionally, we perform a Poincar\'e compactification
process allowing to construct a global phase space containing all the
cosmological information in both finite and infinite regions for all the
models.

different error rates and the costs to be minimized. The receiver operating
characteristic is widely used in the machine learning community to analyze the
performance of parametric classifiers or sets of Pareto optimal classifiers. In
order to directly compare two sets of classifiers the area (or volume) under
the convex hull can be used as a scalar indicator for the performance of a set
of classifiers in receiver operating characteristic space.
  Recently, the convex hull based multiobjective genetic programming algorithm
was proposed and successfully applied to maximize the convex hull area for
binary classification problems. The contribution of this paper is to extend
this algorithm for dealing with higher dimensional problem formulations. In
particular, we discuss problems where parsimony (or classifier complexity) is
stated as a third objective and multi-class classification with three different
true classification rates to be maximized.
  The design of the algorithm proposed in this paper is inspired by
indicator-based evolutionary algorithms, where first a performance indicator
for a solution set is established and then a selection operator is designed
that complies with the performance indicator. In this case, the performance
indicator will be the volume under the convex hull. The algorithm is tested and
analyzed in a proof of concept study on different benchmarks that are designed
for measuring its capability to capture relevant parts of a convex hull.
  Further benchmark and application studies on email classification and feature
selection round up the analysis and assess robustness and usefulness of the new
algorithm in real world settings.

leagues invaluable well-beyond the scope of simulated soccer matches. In this

demonstrate their utility directly, we leverage the ability to run parallelised

during pair-wise conversations, where errors are represented by error rates in
a uniform probability distribution. First, a model of naming game with learning
errors in communications (NGLE) is proposed. Then, a strategy for agents to
prevent learning errors is suggested. To that end, three typical topologies of
communication networks, namely random-graph, small-world and scale-free
networks with different parameters, are employed to investigate the effects of
various learning errors. Simulation results on these models show that 1)
learning errors slightly affect the convergence speed but distinctively
increase the requirement for memory of each agent during lexicon propagation;
2) the maximum number of different words held by the whole population increases
linearly as the value of the error rate increases; 3) without applying any
strategy to eliminate learning errors, there is a threshold value of the
learning errors which impairs the convergence. The new findings help to better
understand the role of learning errors in naming game as well as human language
development from a network science perspective.

task by providing tools that allow researchers to select from several
classification methods and specific test strategies. Despite its popularity,
the current WEKA environment for batch experiments, namely Experimenter, has
four limitations that impact its usability: the selection of value ranges for
methods options lacks flexibility and is not intuitive; there is no support for
parallelisation when running large-scale data mining tasks; the XML schema is
difficult to read, necessitating the use of the Experimenter's graphical user
interface for generation and modification; and robustness is limited by the
fact that results are not saved until the last test has concluded.
  FlexDM implements an interface to WEKA to run batch processing tasks in a
simple and intuitive way. In a short and easy-to-understand XML file, one can
define hundreds of tests to be performed on several datasets. FlexDM also
allows those tests to be executed asynchronously in parallel to take advantage
of multi-core processors, significantly increasing usability and productivity.
Results are saved incrementally for better robustness and reliability.

them. For the selected interaction models, $N\Lambda$ interactions reduce the
maximum mass of NS by about 30~\%, while $\Lambda\Lambda$ interactions can give
about 10~\% enhancement. Consequently, we find that some Skyrme force models
predict the maximum mass of NS consistent with the observation of $2 M_\odot$
NSs, and at the same time satisfy observationally constrained mass-radius
relations.

multi-tier heterogeneous networks (HetNets) in both downlink and uplink in the
interference-limited regime. Users are associated with base-stations (BSs)
based on the biased downlink received power. Spectrum is either shared or
orthogonally partitioned among the tiers. This paper models the placement of
BSs in different tiers as spatial point processes and adopts stochastic
geometry to derive the theoretical mean proportionally fair utility of the
network based on the coverage rate. By formulating and solving the network
utility maximization problem, the optimal user association bias factors and
spectrum partition ratios are analytically obtained for the multi-tier network.
The resulting analysis reveals that the downlink and uplink user associations
do not have to be symmetric. For uplink under spectrum sharing, if all tiers
have the same target signal-to-interference ratio (SIR), distance-based user
association is shown to be optimal under a variety of path loss and power
control settings. For both downlink and uplink, under orthogonal spectrum
partition, it is shown that the optimal proportion of spectrum allocated to
each tier should match the proportion of users associated with that tier.
Simulations validate the analytical results. Under typical system parameters,
simulation results suggest that spectrum partition performs better for downlink
in terms of utility, while spectrum sharing performs better for uplink with
power control.

for modeling, predicting, and compressing multi-dimensional correlated data

method, called MORES, for stream data. MORES can \emph{dynamically} learn the
structure of the coefficients change in each update step to facilitate the
model's continuous refinement. We observe that limited expressive ability of
the regression model, especially in the preliminary stage of online update,
often leads to the variables in the residual errors being dependent. In light
of this point, MORES intends to \emph{dynamically} learn and leverage the
structure of the residual errors to improve the prediction accuracy. Moreover,
we define three statistical variables to \emph{exactly} represent all the seen
samples for \emph{incrementally} calculating prediction loss in each online
update round, which can avoid loading all the training data into memory for
updating model, and also effectively prevent drastic fluctuation of the model
in the presence of noise. Furthermore, we introduce a forgetting factor to set
different weights on samples so as to track the data streams' evolving
characteristics quickly from the latest samples. Experiments on one synthetic
dataset and three real-world datasets validate the effectiveness of the
proposed method. In addition, the update speed of MORES is at least 2000
samples processed per second on the three real-world datasets, more than 15
times faster than the state-of-the-art online learning algorithm.

anthropogenic modifications of landscapes can produce large changes in a

investigated the evolution of high-density turbulent molecular clouds swept by

networks of thin filamentary clouds with a sub-parsec width. The colliding flow
accumulates the filamentary clouds into a sheet cloud and promotes active star
formation for initially high-density clouds. Clouds with a colliding flow
exhibit a finer filamentary network than clouds without a colliding flow. The
probability distribution functions (PDFs) for the density and column density
can be fitted by lognormal functions for clouds without colliding flow. When
the initial turbulence is weak, the column density PDF has a power-law wing at
high column densities. The colliding flow considerably deforms the PDF, such
that the PDF exhibits a double peak. The stellar mass distributions reproduced
here are consistent with the classical initial mass function with a power-law
index of $-1.35$ when the initial clouds have a high density. The distribution
of stellar velocities agrees with the gas velocity distribution, which can be
fitted by Gaussian functions for clouds without colliding flow. For clouds with
colliding flow, the velocity dispersion of gas tends to be larger than the
stellar velocity dispersion. The signatures of colliding flows and turbulence
appear in channel maps reconstructed from the simulation data. Clouds without
colliding flow exhibit a cloud-scale velocity shear due to the turbulence. In
contrast, clouds with colliding flow show a prominent anti-correlated
distribution of thin filaments between the different velocity channels,

radial profiles of the DM distribution in substructures, cosmic variance, and
the detection threshold, and compare it to the anisotropy in the DGRB observed
by the Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT). By comparing the upper limits on the
DM self-annihilation cross-section, <$\sigma v$>, implied by the anisotropy to
the intensity of the DGRB and detected sources in the LAT 2-yr Point Source

nucleosynthetic predictions of AGB models and of models of rotating massive
stars with internal mixing and mass loss. We also analyze the different
behaviors of $\alpha$-- and CNO--elements, as well the abundances of elements
involved in the Ne--Na and Mg--Al cycles. We show that CEMP-no stars exhibit
products of He--burning that have gone through partial mixing and processing by
the CNO cycle, producing low $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C and a broad variety of [C/N] and
[O/N] ratios. From a $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C vs. [C/N] diagram, we conclude that
neither the yields of AGB stars (in binaries or not) nor the yields of classic
supernovae can fully account for the observed CNO abundances in CEMP-no stars.
Better agreement is obtained once the chemical contribution by stellar winds of
fast-rotating massive stars is taken into account, where partial mixing takes
place, leading to various amounts of CNO being ejected. CEMP--no stars present
a wide variety in the [C/Fe], [N/Fe], [O/Fe], [Na/Fe], [Mg/Fe], [Al/Fe], and
[Sr/Fe] ratios. We show that back-and-forth, partial mixing between the He--
and H--regions may account for this variety. Some s--elements, mainly of the
first peak, may even be produced by these processes in a small fraction of the
CEMP--no stars. We propose a classification scheme for the CEMP--no and low--s
stars, based on the changes in composition produced by these successive
back-and-forth mixing motions.

the primary and secondary $O-C$ curves of each system for the light-travel time
effect (LTTE), as well as dynamical perturbations caused by the tertiary on
different timescales. For the first time, we include those contributions of
three-body interactions which originate from the eccentric nature of the inner
binary. These effects manifest themselves both on the period of the triple
system, $P_2$, and on the longer ""apse-node"" timescale. We demonstrate that
consideration of the dynamically forced rapid apsidal motion yields an
efficient and independent tool for the determination of the binary orbit's
eccentricity and orientation, as well as the 3D configuration of the triple.
Modeling the forced apsidal motion also helps to resolve the degeneracy between
the shapes of the LTTE and the dynamical delay terms on the $P_2$ timescale,
due to the strong dependence of the apsidal motion period on the triple's mass
ratio. This can lead to the independent determination of the binary and
tertiary masses without the need for independent radial velocity measurements.
Through the use of our analytic method for fitting $O-C$ curves we have
obtained robust solutions for system parameters for the ten most ideal triples
of our sample, and only somewhat less robust, but yet acceptable, fits for the
remaining systems. Finally we study the results of our 26 system parameter fits

considering ages of 10,000 to 50,000 years, cosmic-ray ionization rates of 0.5
to 50 times 10^-16 s^-1, uniformly-sized 0.1-1 micron dust grains, a dust/gas
ratio of 1%, and several sets of initial molecular abundances with C/O <1 and
>1.
  Constant abundance models give good fits to the data for CO, CN, CS, HCO+,
H2CO, N2H+, C2H, NO, OCS, OH, H2CS, O, C, C+, and CH. Models with an abundance
jump at 100 K give good fits to the data for NH3, SO, SO2, H2S, H2O, HCl, and
CH3OH. For HCN and HNC, the best models have an abundance jump at 230 K. The
time-dependent chemical model can accurately explain abundance profiles of 15
out of these 24 species. The jump-like radial profiles for key species like
HCO+, NH3, and H2O are consistent with the outcome of the time-dependent
chemical modeling. The best-fit model has a chemical age of 10-50 kyr, a solar
C/O ratio of 0.44, and a cosmic-ray ionization rate of 5 x 10^-17 s^-1; grain
properties and external UV intensity do not affect the calculated chemical
structure much.
  We thus demonstrate that simple constant or jump-like abundance profiles
agree with time-dependent chemical modeling for most key C-, O-, N-, and
S-bearing molecules. The main exceptions are species with very few observed
transitions (C, O, C+, and CH), with a poorly established chemical network
(HCl, H2S) or whose chemistry is strongly affected by surface processes
(CH3OH).

controllable external black-body radiations. The theory recovers known physical
results, for example the linear relation between the thermal current and the
temperatures difference of two black-bodies. Furthermore, our theory is not
limited to the linear regime and goes beyond accounting for non linear effects
and transient phenomena. In the strong coupling and large temperature
gradients, we show that there is a maximum energy current that the system can
sustain and we recover the Kramers' turnover. Since the present theory is
general and can be adapted to describe both electron and phonon dynamics, it
provides a first step towards a unified formalism for investigating thermal and

the plant matter is consumed by herbivores annually,but the reason has been
unclear due to the lack of food web models for predicting the absolute
herbivore biomass in physical units. Here, I present a simple parameterized
mathematical food web model that can predict the biomass density of herbivores
h (kg protein/m3) and carnivores c from ecological factors such as the
nutritive values of plants np (kg protein/m3), herbivores nh, and carnivores
nc, searching efficiency (volume) of carnivores S (/day), eating efficiency
(speed) of herbivores eh (/day) and carnivores ec, respiratory decrease in
herbivore and carnivore biomasses, dh (/day) and dc, absorption efficiency of
herbivores and carnivores h (ratio) and c, and probabilities of carnivores
preying on herbivores or carnivores, Phc (ratio) and Pcc.The model predicts a
stable equilibrium with low herbivore biomass h sufficient to keep the world
green if the food web consists of the three trophic levels, plants, herbivores
and carnivores; intraguild predation of carnivores exists; np<nh,nc; S>>eh, and
Phc>Pcc >0,which are well-realized in above-ground terrestrial ecosystems where
plant-rich ""green world"" is common. The h and c calculated from our model
showed good agreement with those from empirical observations in forests, where
both h and c are ca. 100 mg (fresh biomass/m2), and in savannahs. The model
predicts that the nutritive values and digestibility of plants are positively
correlated with h and the intensity of herbivory, which theoretically explains
the out-door defensive effects of the anti-nutritive or quantitative defenses
(e.g., tannins, protease inhibitors) of plants, and predicts that c and c/h are
positively correlated with the relative growth rate of herbivores. The present
model introduced parameterized realities into food web theory.

a physical interpretation that points outside the Legendre submanifold can
represent nonequilibrium states of thermodynamic variables, in addition to that
points of a given Legendre submanifold can represent equilibrium states of the
variables, this class of contact Hamiltonian vector fields is physically
interpreted as a class of relaxation processes, in which thermodynamic
variables achieve an equilibrium state from a nonequilibrium state through a
time evolution, a typical nonequilibrium phenomenon. Geometric properties of
such vector fields on contact manifolds are characterized after introducing a
metric tensor field on a contact manifold. It is also shown that a contact

is currently being reported in different optical glasses. For the first time we
discuss and experimentally demonstrate the presence of two regimes of ion
migration found in laser written waveguides. Regime-I, corresponds to the
initial waveguide formation mainly via light element migration (in our case
atomic weight < 31u), whereas regime-II majorly corresponds to the movement of
heavy elements. This behavior brings attention to a problem which has never
been analyzed before and that affects laser written active waveguides in which
active ions migrate changing their local spectroscopic properties. The
migration of active ions may in fact detune the pre-designed optimal values of
active photonic devices. This paper experimentally evidences this problem and
provides solutions to avert it.

commonly enriched in C/O ratio compared to that of the host star. This has been
explained by considering that the gas phase of the disc could be inhomogeneous,
exceeding the stellar C/O ratio in regions where these planets formed; but few
studies have considered the drift of the gas and the migration of planets. We
aim to derive the gas composition in planets to evaluate if the formation of
giant planets with an enriched C/O ratio is possible. The study focusses on the
effects of different processes on the C/O ratio like the disc evolution, the
drift of gas, and the migration of the planet. We used our previous models for
computation of the chemical composition together with the planet formation
model of Alibert et al. (2013), to which we added the composition and drift of
the gas phase of the disc composed of major volatile species, H2 and He. The
study focusses on the region where ice lines are present and influence the C/O
ratio of the planets. Modelling shows that the condensation of volatile species
allows for C/O enrichment in specific parts of the protoplanetary disc, of up
to 4 times the solar value. This leads to the formation of planets that can be
enriched in C/O in their envelope up to 3 times the solar value. The migration
of planets, the evolution of the gas phase, and the irradiation of the disc
enables the evolution of the initial C/O ratio with a decrease in the outer
part of the disc and an increase in the inner part. The total C/O ratio of the
planets is governed by the contribution of ices accreted, suggesting that high
C/O ratios measured in planetary atmospheres are indicative of a lack of
exchange of material between the core of a planet and its envelope or an
observational bias, and suggesting that the observed C/O ratio is not
representative of the total C/O ratio of the planet.

eccentric debris belt with sharp edges. This sort of a morphology is usually
attributed to planetary perturbations, but the orbit of the only planetary
candidate detected so far, Fomalhaut b, is too eccentric to efficiently shape
the belt. Alternative models that could account for the morphology without
invoking a planet are stellar encounters and gas-dust interactions.
  Aims: We aim to test the possibility of gas-dust interactions as the origin
of the observed morphology by putting upper limits on the total gas content of
the Fomalhaut belt.
  Methods: We derive upper limits on the CII 158 $\mu$m and OI 63 $\mu$m
emission by using non-detections from the Photodetector Array Camera and
Spectrometer (PACS) onboard the Herschel Space Observatory. Line fluxes are
converted into total gas mass using the non-local thermodynamic equilibrium
(non-LTE) code RADEX. We consider two different cases for the elemental
abundances of the gas: solar abundances and abundances similar to those
observed for the gas in the $\beta$ Pictoris debris disc.
  Results: The gas mass is shown to be below the millimetre dust mass by a
factor of at least $\sim$3 (for solar abundances) respectively $\sim$300 (for
$\beta$ Pic-like abundances).
  Conclusions: The lack of gas co-spatial with the dust implies that gas-dust
interactions cannot efficiently shape the Fomalhaut debris belt. The morphology
is therefore more likely due to a yet unseen planet (Fomalhaut c) or stellar
encounters.

topics in the modern astrophysics. One approach to address this issue is to
look at the Galactic bulge since it is the closest. According to some
theoretical models, our bulge may have built up from the merger of
substructures formed from the fragmentation of a gaseous disk in the early
phases of Galactic evolution. We may have discovered the remnant of one of
these substructures in the stellar system Terzan 5. In fact, Terzan 5 hosts two
stellar populations with quite different iron abundances, thus suggesting it
once was far more massive than today. Moreover, its peculiar chemistry
strikingly resembles that observed in the Galactic bulge. In this Thesis we
performed a detailed photometric and spectroscopic analysis of this cluster to
determine its formation and evolution. Form the photometric point of view we
built a high-resolution differential reddening map in the direction of the
system and we measured relative proper motions to separate its member
population from the contaminating bulge and disk stars. From the spectroscopic
point of view we measured abundances for more than 600 stars belonging to
Terzan 5 and its surroundings in order to build the largest
field-decontaminated metallicity distribution for this system. We find that the
metallicity distribution is extremely broad (>1 dex) and we discovered a third,
metal-poor and alpha-enhanced population with average [Fe/H]=-0.8 dex. The
striking similarity between Terzan 5 and the bulge in terms of their chemical
formation and evolution that is clearly revealed by this Thesis suggests that
Terzan 5 formed in situ with the Galactic bulge. In particular its metal-poor
populations trace the early stages of the bulge formation, while its most
metal-rich component may contain crucial information on the bulge more recent
evolution.

for the prompt emission, or conversely, if the correlation can be used to
constrain the internal shock scenario. We developed a toy model where internal
shocks are limited to the collision of only two shells. Synthetic burst
populations were constructed for various distributions of the model parameters,
such as the injected power in the relativistic outflow, the average Lorentz
factor, and its typical contrast between the shells. These parameters can be
independent or linked by various relations. Synthetic $E_{\rm p}$ - $E_{\rm

observed correlation. The reference observed correlation is the one defined by
the BAT6 sample, a sample of Swift bursts almost complete in redshift and
affected by well-known and reproducible instrumental selection effects. The
comparison is then performed with a subsample of synthetic bursts that satisfy
the same selection criteria as were imposed on the BAT6 sample. A satisfactory
agreement between model and data can often be achieved, but only if several
strong constraints are satisfied on both the dynamics of the flow and the

retrieval, researchers have put remarkable research efforts into improving the
efficiency of kNN-based feature matching, pursuing to match thousands of
features against a database within fractions of a second. However, due to the
high-dimensional nature of image features that reduces the effectivity of index
structures (curse of dimensionality), due to the vast amount of features stored
in image databases (images are often represented by up to several thousand
features), this ultimate goal demanded to trade query runtimes for query
precision. In this paper we address an approach complementary to indexing in
order to improve the runtimes of retrieval by querying only the most promising
keypoint descriptors, as this affects matching runtimes linearly and can
therefore lead to increased efficiency. As this reduction of kNN queries
reduces the number of tentative correspondences, a loss of query precision is
minimized by an additional image-level correspondence generation stage with a
computational performance independent of the underlying indexing structure. We
evaluate such an adaption of the standard recognition pipeline on a variety of
datasets using both SIFT and state-of-the-art binary descriptors. Our results
suggest that decreasing the number of queried descriptors does not necessarily
imply a reduction in the result quality as long as alternative ways of
increasing query recall (by thoroughly selecting k) and MAP (using image-level
correspondence generation) are considered.

unit length of quaternions. The Langevin thermostat also ensures that the
conjugate angular momenta stay within the tangent space of the quaternion
coordinates, as required by the Hamiltonian dynamics of rigid bodies. We have
constructed three geometric numerical integrators for the Langevin thermostat
and one for the gradient thermostat. The numerical integrators reflect key
properties of the thermostats themselves. Namely, they all preserve the unit
length of quaternions, automatically, without the need of a projection onto the
unit sphere. The Langevin integrators also ensure that the angular momenta
remain within the tangent space of the quaternion coordinates. The Langevin
integrators are quasi-symplectic and of weak order two. The numerical method
for the gradient thermostat is of weak order one. Its construction exploits
ideas of Lie-group type integrators for differential equations on manifolds. We
numerically compare the discretization errors of the Langevin integrators, as
well as the efficiency of the gradient integrator compared to the Langevin ones
when used in the simulation of rigid TIP4P water model with smoothly truncated
electrostatic interactions. We observe that the gradient integrator is
computationally less efficient than the Langevin integrators. We also compare
the relative accuracy of the Langevin integrators in evaluating various static

  Bayesian inverse problems","22 pages",,,,"math.ST math.PR stat.TH","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A demanding challenge in Bayesian inversion is to efficiently characterize
the posterior distribution. This task is problematic especially in
high-dimensional non-Gaussian problems, where the structure of the posterior
can be very chaotic and difficult to analyse. Current inverse problem
literature often approaches the problem by considering suitable point
estimators for the task. Typically the choice is made between the maximum a
posteriori (MAP) or the conditional mean (CM) estimate.
  The benefits of either choice are not well-understood from the perspective of
infinite-dimensional theory. Most importantly, there exists no general scheme
regarding how to connect the topological description of a MAP estimate to a
variational problem. The results by Dashti et. al. (2013) resolve this issue
for non-linear inverse problems in Gaussian framework. In this work we improve
the current understanding by introducing a novel concept called the weak MAP
(wMAP) estimate. We show that any MAP estimate in the sense of Dashti et. al.
(2013) is a wMAP estimate and, moreover, how in general infinite-dimensional
non-Gaussian problems the wMAP estimate connects to a variational formulation.
Such a formulation yields many properties of the estimate that were earlier
impossible to study.
  In a recent work by Burger and Lucka (2014) the MAP estimator was studied in
the context of Bayes cost method. Using Bregman distances, proper convex Bayes
cost functions were introduced for which the MAP estimator is the Bayes
estimator. Here, we generalize these results to the infinite-dimensional
setting. Moreover, we discuss the implications of our results for some examples
of prior models such as the Besov prior and hierarchical prior.

source outburst. Recent observations of GX 339-4 have demonstrated the presence
of a variable synchrotron spectral break in the mid-infrared band that was
associated with its compact jet. In the model used in this study, we assume
that the jet emission is produced by electrons accelerated in internal shocks
driven by rapid fluctuations of the jet velocity. The resulting spectral energy
distribution (SED) and variability properties are very sensitive to the Fourier
power spectrum density (PSD) of the assumed fluctuations of the jet Lorentz
factor. These fluctuations are likely to be triggered by the variability of the
accretion flow which is best traced by the X-ray emission. Taking the PSD of
the jet Lorentz factor fluctuations to be identical to the observed X-ray PSD,
our study finds that the internal shock model successfully reproduces the radio
to infrared SED of the source at the time of the observations as well as the
reported strong mid-infrared spectral variability.

clusters. We also study how the GLFs depend on cluster redshift, mass, and
substructure, and compare the GLFs of clusters with those of the field. We
separately investigate the GLFs of blue and red-sequence (RS) galaxies to
understand the evolution of different cluster populations. We find that the
shapes of our GLFs are similar for the B, V, R, and I bands with a drop at the
red GLF faint end that is more pronounced at high-redshift: alpha(red) ~ -0.5
at 0.40 < z < 0.65 and alpha(red) > 0.1 at 0.65 < z < 0.90. The blue GLFs have
a steeper faint end (alpha(blue) ~ -1.6) than the red GLFs, that appears to be
independent of redshift. For the full cluster sample, blue and red GLFs
intersect at M(V) = -20, M(R) = -20.5, and M(I) = -20.3. A study of how galaxy
types evolve with redshift shows that late type galaxies appear to become early
types between z ~ 0.9 and today. Finally, the faint ends of the red GLFs of
more massive clusters appear to be richer than less massive clusters, which is
more typical of the lower redshift behaviour. Our results indicate that our
clusters form at redshifts higher than z = 0.9 from galaxy structures that
already have an established red sequence. Late type galaxies then appear to
evolve into early types, enriching the red-sequence between this redshift and
today. This effect is consistent with the evolution of the faint end slope of
the red-sequence and the galaxy type evolution that we find. Finally, faint
galaxies accreted from the field environment at all redshifts might have
replaced the blue late type galaxies that converted into early types,
explaining the lack of evolution in the faint end slopes of the blue GLFs.

across the mass spectrum. In clustered regions, understanding powering sources
and outflow components poses a significant problem. Aims: To understand the
dynamics in the outflow(s) from a cluster in the process of forming massive
stars. Methods: We use new VLA observations of the molecular gas (SiO, CS, OCS
and \molec) in the massive star forming region IRAS 17233-3606 which contains a
number of HII regions. We compare these observations to previously published
molecular data for this source in order to get a holistic view of the outflow
dynamics. Results:We find that the dynamics of the various species can be
explained by a single large scale ($\sim 0.15$ pc) outflow when compared to the
sizes of the HII regions, with the different morphologies of the blue and red
outflow components explained with respect to the morphology of the surrounding
envelope. We further find that the direction of the velocity gradients seen in
OCS and \molec are suggestive of a combination of rotation and outflow motions
in the warm gas surrounding the HII regions near the base of the large scale
outflow. Conclusions: Our results show that the massive protostars forming
within this region appear to be contributing to a single outflow on large
scales. This single large scale outflow is traced by a number of different
species as the outflow interacts with its surroundings. On the small scales,
there appear to be multiple mechanisms contributing to the dynamics which could
be a combination of either a small scale outflow or rotation with the dynamics
of the large scale outflow.

this seems impossible, since the agents may be lying. We model this task by
letting the events be distributed according to some distribution p and the task
is to estimate p under unknown noise. Again, this is impossible without
additional assumptions. We report here the finding of very natural such

independent and invertible (in the sense of matrices) noise, is already
sufficient: If the true distribution and the observations are modeled on the
same finite alphabet, then the number of such copies needed to determine p to
the highest possible precision is exactly three! This result can be seen as a
counterpart to independent component analysis. Therefore, we call our approach
'dependent component analysis'. In addition, we present generalizations of the

the 'activation' of invertibility through multiple parallel uses.

multiscale segmentation method, FDRSeg, which controls the false discovery rate
(FDR) in the sense that the number of false jumps is bounded linearly by the
number of true jumps. In this way, it adapts the detection power to the number
of true jumps. We prove a non-asymptotic upper bound for its FDR in a Gaussian
setting, which allows to calibrate the only parameter of FDRSeg properly.
Change-point locations, as well as the signal, are shown to be estimated in a
uniform sense at optimal minimax convergence rates up to a log-factor. The
latter is w.r.t. $L^p$-risk, $p \ge 1$, over classes of step functions with
bounded jump sizes and either bounded, or possibly increasing, number of
change-points. FDRSeg can be efficiently computed by an accelerated dynamic
program; its computational complexity is shown to be linear in the number of
observations when there are many change-points. The performance of the proposed
method is examined by comparisons with some state of the art methods on both
simulated and real datasets. An R-package is available online.

nonlinear filter dynamics may be regarded as a gradient flow, or a steepest
descent, for a certain energy functional with respect to the Kullback-Leibler

  The second part of the paper is concerned with derivation of the feedback

processes at work in AGN are still under debate. In particular the origin of
the radio emission and the mechanisms involved are among the open questions in
astrophysics. In the radio-loud AGN population the radio emission is linked to
the presence of bipolar outflows of relativistic jets. However, the large
majority of the AGN population do not form powerful highly-relativistic jets on
kpc scales and are characterized by radio luminosity up to 10^23 W/Hz at 1.4
GHz, challenging our knowledge on the physical processes at the basis of the
radio emission in radio-quiet objects. The main mechanisms proposed so far are
synchrotron radiation from mildly relativistic mini-jets, thermal
cyclo-synchrotron emission by low-efficiency accretion flow (like ADAF or
ADIOS), or thermal free-free emission from the X-ray heated corona or wind. The
difficulty in understanding the main mechanism involved is related to the
weakness of these objects, which precludes the study of non-local radio-quiet
AGN. Multifrequency, high-sensitivity radio observations are crucial to
constrain the nature of the power engine, and they may help in distinguishing
between the contribution from star formation and AGN activity. The advent of
the SKA, with its sub-arcsecond resolution and unprecedented sensitivity will
allow us to investigate these processes in radio-quiet AGN, even at high
redshift for the first time. Both the broad-band radio spectrum and the
polarization information will help us in disentangling between non-thermal and
thermal origin of the radio emission. The jump in sensitivity of a few order of
magnitudes at the (sub-)uJy level will enable us to detect radio emission from
a large number of radio-quiet AGN at high redshift, providing a fundamental
step in our understanding of their cosmological evolution. (Abridged)

gases of indistinguishable punctures with a chemical potential. In this
picture, which arises from loop quantum gravity, the black hole microstates are
defined by finite families of half-integers spins coloring the punctures, and
the near-horizon energy measured by quasi-local stationary observers defines
the various thermodynamical ensembles. The punctures carry excitations of
quantum geometry in the form of quanta of area, and the total horizon area
$a_\text{H}$ is given by the sum of these microscopic contributions. We assume
here that the system satisfies the Bose-Einstein statistics, and that each
microstate is degenerate with a holographic degeneracy given by
$\exp\big(\lambda a_\text{H}/\ell_\text{Pl}^2\big)$ and $\lambda>0$. We analyze
in detail the thermodynamical properties resulting from these inputs, and in
particular compute the grand canonical entropy. We explain why the requirements
that the temperature be fixed to the Unruh temperature and that the chemical
potential vanishes do not specify completely the semi-classical regime of large
horizon area, and classify in turn what the various regimes can be. When the
degeneracy saturates the holographic bound ($\lambda=1/4$), there exists a
semi-classical regime in which the subleading corrections to the entropy are
logarithmic. Furthermore, this regime corresponds to a Bose-Einstein
condensation, in the sense that it is dominated by punctures carrying the
minimal (or ground state) spin value $1/2$.

the regular slowdown of neutron stars, and high-energy magnetar flares. We
argue that magnetic field decay builds up stresses in a neutron star's crust,
as the elastic shear force resists the Lorentz force's desire to rearrange the
global magnetic-field equilibrium. We derive a criterion for crust-breaking
induced by a changing magnetic-field configuration, and use this to investigate
strain patterns in a neutron star's crust for a variety of different
magnetic-field models. Universally, we find that the crust is most liable to
break if the magnetic field has a strong toroidal component, in which case the
epicentre of the crustquake is around the equator. We calculate the energy
released in a crustquake as a function of the fracture depth, finding that it
is independent of field strength. Crust-breaking is, however, associated with a
characteristic local field strength of $2.4\times 10^{14}$ G for a breaking
strain of $0.001$, or $2.4\times 10^{15}$ G at a breaking strain of $0.1$. We
find that even the most luminous magnetar giant flare could have been powered

The last spin-up glitch of the highly magnetised pulsar J1119$-$6127 back in
2007 was the first glitch in a rotationally powered radio pulsar to be
accompanied by radiative changes. Moreover, it was followed by an uncommon
glitch relaxation that resulted in a smaller spin-down rate relative to the
prediction of the pre-glitch timing model. Here, we present 4 years of new
radio timing observations and analyse the total of 16 years of timing data for
this source. The new data uncover an ongoing evolution of the spin-down rate,
thereby allowing us to exclude permanent changes in the external or internal
torque as a stand-alone cause of the peculiar features of the glitch recovery.
Furthermore, no additional variations of the radio pulse profile are detected,
strengthening the association of the previously observed transient emission
features with the glitching activity. A self-consistent measurement of the
braking index yields a value $n\simeq2.7$, indicating a trajectory in the
$P-\dot{P}$ plane inclined towards the magnetars. Such a potential evolutionary
link might be strengthened by a, possibly permanent, reduction of $\sim15\%$ in
$n$ at the epoch of the 2007 glitch.

short pulses (spikes) are emitted sparsely by neurons to signal the occurrence
of an event at a particular point in time. Such spike-based computations
promise to be substantially more power-efficient than traditional clocked

design networks of spiking neurons that are able to carry out demanding

computations of networks of spiking neurons. In particular, we show that a
suitable design enables them to solve hard constraint satisfaction problems
from the domains of planning - optimization and verification - logical
inference. The underlying design principles employ noise as a computational
resource. Nevertheless the timing of spikes (rather than just spike rates)
plays an essential role in the resulting computations. Furthermore, one can
demonstrate for the Traveling Salesman Problem a surprising computational
advantage of networks of spiking neurons compared with traditional artificial

three different types (or a mixture of them): types I and II, which are

for this PHA the k extra bound states form k singlets isolated from the higher

(HCBs) has tremendous scientific and technological implications for light
harvesting and quantum computation. Here, we study decay of excited-state
population and decoherence in two models for HCBs, namely: an infinite-range
HCB model governed by Markovian dynamics and a two-site HCB model with
site-dependent strong potentials and subject to non-Markovian dynamics. Both
models are investigated in the regimes of antiadiabaticity and strong
HCB-phonon coupling with each site providing a different local optical phonon
environment; furthermore, the HCB systems in both models are taken to be
initially uncorrelated with the environment in the polaronic frame of
reference. For the infinite-range model, we derive an effective many-body
Hamiltonian that commutes with the long-range system Hamiltonian and thus has
the same set of eigenstates; consequently, a quantum-master-equation approach
shows that the quantum states of the system do not decohere. In the case of the
two-site HCB model, we show clearly that the degree of decoherence and decay of
excited state are enhanced by the proximity of the site-energy difference to
the eigenenergy of phonons and are most pronounced when the site-energy
difference is at resonance with twice the polaronic energy; additionally, the
decoherence and the decay effects are reduced when the strength of HCB-phonon
coupling is increased. Even for a multimode situation, the degree of
decoherence and decay are again dictated by the nearness of the energy
difference to the allowed phonon mode eigenenergies.

schemes based on quantum mechanics, and there is a strong need for an ultimate
architecture able to overcome the limitations of recent proposals such as those
based on entanglement percolation or quantum repeaters. In this work we provide
broad theoretical background for the development of such technologies. In
particular, we investigate the question of whether entanglement distribution is
more efficient if some amount of entanglement -- or some amount of correlations
in general -- is available prior to the transmission stage of the protocol. We
show that in the presence of noise the answer to this question strongly depends
on the type of noise and on the way how entanglement is quantified. On the one
hand, subadditive entanglement measures do not show advantage of preshared
correlations if entanglement is established via combinations of single-qubit
Pauli channels. On the other hand, based on the superadditivity conjecture of
distillable entanglement, we provide evidence that this phenomenon occurs for
this measure. These results strongly suggest that sending one half of some pure
entangled state down a noisy channel is the best strategy for any subadditive
entanglement quantifier, thus paving the way to a unified approach for
entanglement distribution which does not depend on the nature of noise. We also
provide general bounds for entanglement distribution involving quantum discord,
and present a counter-intuitive phenomenon of the advantage of arbitrarily
little entangled states over maximally entangled ones, which may also occur for
quantum channels relevant in experiments.

to clarify its physical manifestations. Based on a description of the motion of
accelerated, spatially extended laboratories in Minkowski space in terms of
Poincar\'e transformations, it is shown that, from a macroscopic perspective,
an accelerated observer will not register with his measuring instruments any
global thermal effects of acceleration in the inertial (Minkowskian) vacuum
state. As is explained, this result is not in conflict with the well-known fact
that microscopic probes respond non-trivially to acceleration if coupled to the
vacuum. But this response cannot be interpreted as the effect of some heat bath
surrounding the observer. It is also shown that genuine equilibrium states in a
uniformly accelerated laboratory cannot be spatially homogeneous. In
particular, these states coincide with the homogeneous inertial vacuum at
sufficiently large distances from the horizon of the observer and consequently
have the same (zero) temperature there. The analysis is carried out in the
theory of a free massless scalar field; however the conclusion that the Unruh
effect is not of a thermal nature, viz. induced by heat transfer, is generally
valid.

techniques adopting asteroseismic constraints of the uncertainty in the
radiative opacity, in the initial helium abundance, in the mixing-length value,
in the convective core overshooting, and in the microscopic diffusion
efficiency adopted in stellar model computations. We extended our SCEPtER grid
(Valle et al. 2014) to include stars with mass in the range [0.8; 1.6] Msun and
evolutionary stages from the ZAMS to the central hydrogen depletion. The
current typical uncertainty in the observations accounts for 1 sigma
statistical relative error in age determination which in mean ranges from about
-35% to +42%, depending on the mass. However, due to the strong dependence on
the evolutionary phase, the age relative error can be higher than 120% for
stars near the ZAMS, while it is typically of the order of 20% or lower in the
advanced main-sequence phase. The systematic bias on age determination due to a
variation of $\pm$ 1 in the helium-to-metal enrichment ratio Delta Y/Delta Z is
about one-forth of the statistical error in the first 30% of the evolution
while it is negligible for more evolved stages. The maximum bias due to the
presence of the convective core overshooting is of -7% and -13% for mild and
strong overshooting scenarios. For all the examined models the impact of a
variation of $\pm$ 5 in the radiative opacity was found to be negligible. The
most important source of bias are the uncertainty in the mixing-length value
alpha_ml and the neglect of microscopic diffusion. Each of these effects
accounts for a bias which is nearly equal to the random error uncertainty.
Comparison of the results of our technique with other grid techniques on a set
of common stars showed a general agreement. However, the adoption of a
different grid can account for a variation in the mean estimated age up to 1
Gyr.

higher order terms are still accounted for. These higher order terms represent
the precession of the carrier-dopant correlations in the effective magnetic

(periodic) linear chain with finitenumber $N$ of identical particles is
introduced. We suggest a ""fractional elastic harmonic potential"", and obtain
the $N$-periodic fractionalLaplacian operator in the form of a power law matrix
function for the finite chain ($N$ arbitrary not necessarily large) in explicit
form.In the limiting case $N\rightarrow \infty$ this fractional Laplacian
matrix recovers the fractional Laplacian matrix ofthe infinite chain.The
lattice model contains two free material constants, the particle mass $\mu$ and
a frequency$\Omega\_{\alpha}$.The ""periodic string continuum limit"" of the
fractional lattice model is analyzed where lattice constant $h\rightarrow 0$and
length $L=Nh$ of the chain (""string"") is kept finite: Assuming finiteness of
the total mass and totalelastic energy of the chain in the continuum limit
leads to asymptotic scaling behavior for $h\rightarrow 0$ of thetwo material
constants,namely $\mu \sim h$ and $\Omega\_{\alpha}^2 \sim h^{-\alpha}$. In
this way we obtain the $L$-periodic fractional Laplacian (Riesz fractional
derivative) kernel in explicit form.This $L$-periodic fractional Laplacian
kernel recovers for $L\rightarrow\infty$the well known 1D infinite space
fractional Laplacian (Riesz fractional derivative) kernel. When the scaling
exponentof the Laplacian takesintegers, the fractional Laplacian kernel
recovers, respectively, $L$-periodic and infinite space (localized)
distributionalrepresentations of integer-order Laplacians.The results of this
paper appear to beuseful for the analysis of fractional finite domain problems
for instance in anomalous diffusion (L\'evy flights), fractional Quantum

  The primary extension allows more expressive schemas (namely XML schemas and

profound change as his nonlocality theorem gradually became detached from
quantum mechanics, and referred to wider probabilistic theories involving
correlations between separated beables. The proposition that standard quantum
mechanics is itself nonlocal (more precisely, that it violates `local
causality') became divorced from the Bell theorem per se from 1976 on, although
this important point is widely overlooked in the literature. In 1990, the year
of his death, Bell would express serious misgivings about the mathematical form
of the local causality condition, and leave ill-defined the issue of the
consistency between special relativity and violation of the Bell-type
inequality. In our view, the significance of the Bell theorem, both in its
deterministic and stochastic forms, can only be fully understood by taking into

Our approach is based on the $3\times 3$
subequations of Dirac and Duffin-Kemmer-Petiau equations, which link these
equations. We demonstrate that free Dirac equation can be invertibly converted
to spin-$0$ Duffin-Kemmer-Petiau equation in presence of a neutrino field. We
also show that in special external fields, upon assuming again existence of a
neutrino (Weyl) spinor, the Dirac equation can be transformed reversibly to
spin-$0$ Duffin-Kemmer-Petiau equation. We argue that such boson-fermions
transitions are consistent with the main channel of pion decay.

basis of the analysis of their properties and represents an expansion of the
Boolean algebra. The notion of the generalized economic measurements of the
economic quantity and quality of objects of transactions is introduced. It has
been shown that the vector space of economic states constructed on the basis of
these measurements is relativistic. The laws of kinematics of economic objects
in this space have been analyzed and the stages of constructing the dynamics
have been formulated. In particular, the principle of maximum benefit, which
represents an economic analog of the principle of least action in the classical
mechanics, and the principle of relativity as the principle of equality of all
possible consumer preferences have been formulated. The notion of economic
interval between two economic objects invariant to the selection of the vector
of consumer preferences has been introduced. Methods of experimental
verification of the principle of relativity in the space of economic states
have been proposed.
