The
subdiffusion parameters are the same in both parts of the system separated by
the membrane. Using the random walk model with discrete time and space
variables the probabilities (Green's functions) $P(x,t)$ describing a
particle's random walk are found. The membrane, which can be asymmetrical, is
characterized by the two probabilities of stopping a random walker by the
membrane when it tries to pass through the membrane in both opposite
directions. Green's functions are transformed to the system in which the
variables are continuous, and then the membrane permeability coefficients are
given by special formulae which involve the probabilities mentioned above. From
the obtained Green's functions, we derive boundary conditions at the membrane.
One of the conditions demands the continuity of a flux at the membrane but the
other one is rather unexpected and contains the Riemann--Liouville fractional
time derivative $P(x_N^-,t)=\lambda_1 P(x_N^+,t)+\lambda_2 \partial^{\alpha/2}
P(x_N^+,t)/\partial t^{\alpha/2}$, where $\lambda_1$, $\lambda_2$ depending on
membrane permeability coefficients ($\lambda_1=1$ for a symmetrical membrane),
$\alpha$ is a subdiffusion parameter and $x_N$ is the position of the membrane.
This boundary condition shows that the additional `memory effect', represented
by the fractional derivative, is created by the membrane. This effect is also
created by the membrane for a normal diffusion case in which $\alpha=1$.

contention mechanism used in IEEE 802.11 networks is called Carrier Sense

transmitting, effectively reducing the collision probability. Nevertheless,
CSMA/CA relies on a random backoff that while effective and fully
decentralised, in principle is unable to completely eliminate collisions,
therefore degrading the network throughput as more contenders attempt to share
the channel.
  To overcome these situations, Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Enhanced

fully decentralised manner using a deterministic backoff after successful

offers better throughput than CSMA/CA and short-term throughput fairness. This

its performance when coexisting with CSMA/CA nodes. Furthermore, it describes

leverage the impact of channel errors and the addition/withdrawal of nodes over

relative to the production-function crater SFD. Further, if Pluto's surface
volatile layer is comparable to or deeper than crater depths, and if the
viscosity of this layer surface ice is low like the viscosity of pure N2 ice at
Pluto's measured 35 K surface temperature (or as low as the viscosity of CH4
ice at warmer but plausible temperatures on isolated pure-CH4 surfaces on
Pluto), then craters on Pluto may also have significantly viscously relaxed,
also potentially biasing the observed crater SFD and surface crater retention
age. Here we make a first exploration of how these processes can affect the
displayed cratering record on Pluto. We find that Pluto's surface may appear to
be younger owing to these effects than it actually is. We also find that by
comparing Pluto's cratering record to Charon's, it may be possible to estimate
the total loss depth of material from Pluto's surface over geologic time, and
therefore to estimate Pluto's time-averaged escape rate.

these two systems within the algebraic approach to quantum field theory using
the so-called functional formalism. As a first step we construct a suitable
unital *-algebra of observables whose generating functionals are characterized
by a labelling space which is at the same time optimal and separating and
fulfils the F-locality property. Subsequently we give a definition for these
systems of Hadamard states and we investigate explicit examples. In the case of
a single plate, it turns out that one can build algebraic states via a
pull-back of those on the whole Minkowski spacetime, moreover inheriting from
them the Hadamard property. When we consider instead two plates, algebraic
states can be put in correspondence with those on flat spacetime via the
so-called method of images, which we translate to the algebraic setting. For a
massless scalar field we show that this procedure works perfectly for a large
class of quasi-free states including the Poincar\'e vacuum and KMS states.
Eventually Wick polynomials are introduced. Contrary to the Minkowski case, the
extended algebras, built in globally hyperbolic subregions can be collected in
a global counterpart only after a suitable deformation which is expressed
locally in terms of a *-isomorphism. As a last step, we construct explicitly
the two-point function and the regularized energy density, showing, moreover,

can take as input a high number of uncertain parameters and it is important to
identify their influences via a global sensitivity analysis (GSA). However,
these codes can be time consuming which prevents a GSA based on the classical
Sobol' indices, requiring too many simulations. This is especially true as the
number of inputs is important. To address this limitation, we consider recent
advances in dependence measures, focusing on the distance correlation and the
Hilbert-Schmidt independence criterion (HSIC). Our objective is to study these
indices and use them for a screening purpose. Numerical tests reveal some
differences between dependence measures and classical Sobol' indices, and
preliminary answers to ""What sensitivity indices to what situation?"" are
derived. Then, two approaches are proposed to use the dependence measures for a
screening purpose. The first one directly uses these indices with independence
tests; asymptotic tests and their spectral extensions exist and are detailed.
For a higher accuracy in presence of small samples, we propose a non-asymptotic
version based on bootstrap sampling. The second approach is based on a linear
model associating two simulations, which explains their output difference as a
weighed sum of their input differences. From this, a bootstrap method is
proposed for the selection of the influential inputs. We also propose a
heuristic approach for the calibration of the HSIC Lasso method. Numerical
experiments are performed and show the potential of these approaches for
screening when many inputs are not influential.

to discuss the evolutionary status of the stars in context of the most recent

determined to better than typically 5%, 10%, and 20% uncertainty, respectively,
facilitating the mass-radius and mass-luminosity relationships to be recovered
with a similar precision as derived from DEBs. Good agreement between
evolutionary and spectroscopic masses is found. Absolute visual and bolometric
magnitudes are derived to typically 0.15-0.20mag uncertainty. Metallicities are
constrained to better than 15-20% uncertainty and tight constraints on
evolutionary ages of the stars are provided. Signatures of mixing with
CN-cycled material are found in 1/3 of the sample stars. Typically, these are
consistent with the amount predicted by the new Geneva models with rotation. A
few objects are possibly the product of binary evolution. In particular, the
unusual characteristics of tau Sco point to a blue straggler nature, due to a
binary merger. The accuracy and precision achieved in the determination of
fundamental stellar parameters from the quantitative spectroscopy of single
early B-type stars comes close (within a factor 2-4) to data derived from DEBs.
However, significant systematic differences with data from the astrophysical
reference literature are found. Masses are about 10-20% and radii about 25%
lower then the recommended values for luminosity class V, resulting in the
stars being systematically fainter than assumed usually, by about 0.5mag in

evolution in the profiles can then be described as either an arbitrary number
of independent profiles, or using some functional form. We perform simulations

the Susceptible-Infected-Isolated-Recovered ($SI_IR$) model. The isolation
reduces the transmission of the disease because the time in which infection can
spread is reduced. In this scenario we find that the epidemic threshold
increases with the isolation period and the isolation parameter. When the

tractography algorithms. It is important that ODF reconstruction methods yield
accurate, coherent ODFs, in particular for low SNR or coarsely sampled data

reconstructions are often carried out for each voxel separately, disregarding
the observation that neighboring voxels are often quite similar if they belong

$d$, for the class of so-called statistical algorithms recently introduced by
Feldman et al (2013). The lower bound suggests that the $O(p^d)$ runtime
required to exhaustively search over neighborhoods cannot be significantly
improved without restricting the class of models.
  Aside from structural assumptions on the graph such as it being a tree,
hypertree, tree-like, etc., many recent papers on structure learning assume
that the model has the correlation decay property. Indeed, focusing on
ferromagnetic Ising models, Bento and Montanari (2009) showed that all known
low-complexity algorithms fail to learn simple graphs when the interaction
strength exceeds a number related to the correlation decay threshold. Our
second set of results gives a class of repelling (antiferromagnetic) models

describing weak decays of the $b$ quark are currently not excluded by
experimental data. In particular we find that Im $\Delta C_1 $ and Im $\Delta
C_2 $ can easily be of order $\pm 10%$ without violating any constraints from
data. Such a size of new physics effects in $C_1$ and $C_2$ corresponds to an
intrinsic uncertainty in the CKM angle $\gamma$ of the order of $|\delta
\gamma| \approx 4^\circ$, which is slightly below the current experimental
precision. The accuracy in the determination of $\gamma$ can be improved by
putting stronger constraints on the tree-level Wilson coefficients, in
particular $C_1$. To this end we suggest a more refined theoretical study as
well as a more precise measurements of the observables that currently provide
the strongest bounds on hypothetical new weak phases in $C_1$ and $C_2$. We
note that the semi-leptonic CP asymmetries seem to have the best prospect for
improving the bound on the weak phase in $C_1$.

some prime $p$. The local Langlands correspondence attaches to each continuous
$n$--dimensional $\Phi$-semisimple representation $\rho$ of $W'_F$, the
Weil--Deligne group for $\bar F/F$, an irreducible admissible representation
$\pi(\rho)$ of $GL_n(F)$ such that, among other things, the local $L$- and
$\varepsilon$-factors of pairs are preserved. This correspondence should be
robust and preserve various parallel operations on the arithmetic and analytic
sides, such as taking the exterior square or symmetric square. In this paper,
we show that this is the case for the local arithmetic and analytic symmetric
square and exterior square $\varepsilon$--factors, that is, that
$\varepsilon(s,\Lambda^2\rho,\psi)=\varepsilon(s,\pi(\rho),\Lambda^2,\psi)$ and
$\varepsilon(s,Sym^2\rho,\psi)=\varepsilon(s,\pi(\rho),Sym^2,\psi)$. The
agreement of the $L$-functions also follows by our methods, but this was
already known by Henniart. The proof is a robust deformation argument, combined
with local/global techniques, which reduces the problem to the stability of the
analytic $\gamma$-factor $\gamma(s,\pi,\Lambda^2,\psi)$ under highly ramified
twists when $\pi$ is supercuspidal. This last step is achieved by relating the
$\gamma$-factor to a Mellin transform of a partial Bessel function attached to
the representation and then analyzing the asymptotics of the partial Bessel
function, inspired in part by the theory of Shalika germs for Bessel integrals.
The stability for every irreducible admissible representation $\pi$ then
follows from those of the corresponding arithmetic $\gamma$--factors as a
corollary.

was observed from October, 1995, to January, 1996. Along these four solar
rotations the sunspots and subsequent flux concentrations, during the decay
phase of the region, were observed to move in such a way that by December their
orientation conformed to the Hale-Nicholson polarity law. The sigmoidal shape
of the observed soft X-ray coronal loops allows us to determine the sense of
the twist in the magnetic configuration. This sense is confirmed by
extrapolating the observed photospheric magnetic field, using a linear
force-free approach, and comparing the shape of computed field lines to the
observed coronal loops. This sense of twist agrees with that of the dominant
helicity in the solar hemisphere where the region lies, as well as with the
evolution observed in the longitudinal magnetogram during the first rotation.
At first sight the relative motions of the spots may be miss-interpreted as the
rising of an $\Omega$-loop deformed by a kink-instability, but we deduce from
the sense of their relative displacements a handedness for the flux-tube axis
(writhe) which is opposite to that of the twist in the coronal loops and,
therefore, to what is expected for a kink-unstable flux-tube. After excluding
the kink instability, we interpret our observations in terms of a magnetic
flux-tube deformed by external motions while rising through the convective
zone. We compare our results with those of other related studies and we
discuss, in particular, whether the kink instability is relevant to explain the
peculiar evolution of some active regions.

We show that the effective two-band Hamiltonian provides a mismatch between the

mass asymmetry and it is proportional to $B^2$ similar to the diamagnetic shift
of exciton binding energies. However, the dominant term which evolves with $B$
linearly, originates from the multi-orbital and multi-band structures of the
system. Besides, we investigate the transport properties of the system by
calculating the spin-valley resolved conductance and show that, in a low-hole
doped case, the transport channels at the edge are chiral for one of the spin
components. This leads to a localization of the non-chiral spin component in
the presence of disorder and thus provides a spin-valley polarized transport

cosmological constant in three spacetime dimensions is constructed. They
include the most general temporal components of the gauge fields that
manifestly preserve the original asymptotic higher spin extension of the
BMS$_{3}$ algebra, with the same central charge. By virtue of a suitable
permissible gauge choice, it is shown that this set can be directly recovered
as a limit of the boundary conditions that have been recently constructed in
the case of negative cosmological constant, whose asymptotic symmetries are
spanned by two copies of the centrally-extended W$_{3}$ algebra. Since the
generalized asymptotic conditions allow to incorporate chemical potentials
conjugated to the higher spin charges, a higher spin extension of locally flat
cosmological spacetimes becomes naturally included within the set. It is shown
that their thermodynamic properties can be successfully obtained exclusively in
terms of gauge fields and the topology of the Euclidean manifold, which is
shown to be the one of a solid torus, but with reversed orientation as compared
with one of the black holes. It is also worth highlighting that regularity of
the fields can be ensured through a procedure that does not require an explicit
matrix representation of the entire gauge group. In few words, we show that the
temporal components of generalized dreibeins can be consistently gauged away,
which partially fixes the chemical potentials, so that the remaining conditions
can just be obtained by requiring the holonomy of the generalized spin
connection along a thermal circle to be trivial. The extension of the
generalized asymptotically flat behaviour to the case of spins $s\geq2$ is also

consider a general mean-square-error formulation where all agents are
interested in estimating the same target vector. We first show that, in the
absence of any incentives to cooperate, the optimal strategy for the agents is
to behave in a selfish manner with each agent seeking the optimal solution
independently of the other agents. Pareto inefficiency arises as a result of
the fact that agents are not using historical data to predict the behavior of
their neighbors and to know whether they will reciprocate and participate in
sharing information. Motivated by this observation, we develop a reputation
protocol to summarize the opponent's past actions into a reputation score,
which can then be used to form a belief about the opponent's subsequent
actions. The reputation protocol entices agents to cooperate and turns their
optimal strategy into an action-choosing strategy that enhances the overall
social benefit of the network. In particular, we show that when the
communications cost becomes large, the expected social benefit of the proposed
protocol outperforms the social benefit that is obtained by cooperative agents
that always share data. We perform a detailed mean-square-error analysis of the
evolution of the network over three domains: far field, near-field, and
middle-field, and show that the network behavior is stable for sufficiently
small step-sizes. The various theoretical results are illustrated by numerical

switch back whenever she wants until contract maturity paying some switching

motivation and the underlying economic idea is to show that the current
full/partial collateralization mechanisms defined within contracts' CSA - and
now imposed by the banking supervision authorities - are ""suboptimal"" and less
economic than the contingent one that allows to optimally take in account all
the relevant driver namely the expected costs of counterparty default losses -
represented by the (bilateral) CVA - and the expected collateral and funding

first two Hubble Frontier Fields with completed HST WFC3/IR and ACS imaging. To
ensure robust photometric redshift solutions, and to minimize incompleteness,
we confine our search to objects with H_{160} < 28.6 (AB mag), consider only
image regions with an rms noise sigma_{160} > 30 mag (within a 0.5-arcsec
diameter aperture), and insist on detections in both H_{160} and J_{140}. The
result is a survey covering an effective area (after accounting for
magnification) of 10.9 sq. arcmin, which yields 12 galaxies at 8.4 < z < 9.5.
Within the Abell-2744 cluster and parallel fields we confirm the three
brightest objects reported by Ishigaki et al. (2014), but recover only one of
the four z > 8.4 sources reported by Zheng et al. (2014). In the
MACSJ0416.1-240 cluster field we report five objects, and explain why each of
these eluded detection or classification as z ~ 9 galaxies in the published
searches of the shallower CLASH data. Finally, we uncover four z ~ 9 galaxies
from the previously unsearched MACSJ0416.1-240 parallel field. Based on the
published magnification maps we find that only one of these 12 galaxies is
likely boosted by more than a factor of two by gravitational lensing.
Consequently we are able to perform a fairly straightforward reanalysis of the
normalization of the z ~ 9 UV galaxy luminosity function as explored previously
in the HUDF12 programme. We conclude that the new data strengthen the evidence
for a continued smooth decline in UV luminosity density (and hence
star-formation rate density) from z ~ 8 to z ~ 9, contrary to recent reports of
a marked drop-off at these redshifts. This provides further support for the
scenario in which early galaxy evolution is sufficiently extended to explain
cosmic reionization.

  MNRAS",,"10.1093/mnras/stu2445",,"astro-ph.GA astro-ph.SR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The formation of very young massive clusters or ""starburst"" clusters is
currently one of the most widely debated topic in astronomy. The classical
notion dictates that a star cluster is formed in-situ in a dense molecular gas
clump followed by a substantial residual gas expulsion. On the other hand,
based on the observed morphologies of many young stellar associations, a
hierarchical formation scenario is alternatively suggested. A very young (age
$\approx$ 1 Myr), massive ($>10^4M_\odot$) star cluster like the Galactic NGC
3603 young cluster (HD 97950) is an appropriate testbed for distinguishing
between such ""monolithic"" and ""hierarchical"" formation scenarios. A recent
study by Banerjee and Kroupa (2014) demonstrates that the monolithic scenario
remarkably reproduces the HD 97950 cluster. In the present work, we explore the
possibility of the formation of the above cluster via hierarchical assembly of
subclusters. These subclusters are initially distributed over a wide range of
spatial volumes and have various modes of sub-clustering. Unlike the monolithic
model that reproduces HD 97950 very well, the same is found to be prohibitive
with hierarchical assembly alone. Only those systems which assemble promptly
into a single cluster (in $\lesssim1$ Myr) from a close separation (all within
$\lesssim2$ pc) could match the observed density profile of HD 97950 after
$\approx70$% gas dispersal. These results therefore suggest that NGC 3603 young
cluster has formed essentially monolithically, i.e., either in-situ or via a
prompt assembly, followed by a substantial residual gas expulsion. Both
scenarios are consistent with the inferred young age and the small age spread
of this cluster. Future observations of molecular cloud filaments with ALMA and
proper motion measurements of young clusters with Gaia will provide more direct
tests of such birth environments. [Abridged]

calibration. We utilize precisely flux-calibrated spectra to derive improved
filter bandpasses and zero points for the most common sources of photometry for
bright stars. In total we test 40 different filters in the General Catalog of
Photometric Data as well as those from Tycho-2 and Hipparcos. We show that
utilizing inaccurate filter profiles from the literature can create significant
color terms resulting in fluxes that deviate by >10% from actual values. To
remedy this we employ an empirical approach; we iteratively adjust the
literature filter profile and zero point, convolve it with catalog spectra, and
compare to the corresponding flux from the photometry. We adopt the passband
values that produces the best agreement between photometry and spectroscopy and
is independent of stellar color. We find that while most zero points change by
<5%, a few systems change by 10-15%. Our final profiles and zero points are
similar to recent estimates from the literature. Based on determinations of
systematic errors in our selected spectroscopic libraries, we estimate that
most of our improved zero points are accurate to 0.5-1% or better.

different annual modulation expected from solar neutrinos and Dark Matter.
Specifically for cross sections below the neutrino floor the DM signal is
observable through a phase shift and a smaller amplitude for the time-dependent
event rate. This allows the exclusion power to be improved by up to an order of
magnitude for large exposures. In addition we demonstrate that the neutrino
floor exists over a wider mass range than has been previously shown, since the
large uncertainties in the Dark Matter velocity distribution make the signal
spectrum harder to distinguish from the neutrino background. However for most
velocity distributions the neutrino floor can still be surpassed using timing
information, though certain velocity streams may prove problematic.

the dust attenuation, about 2 mag in the B-band. Assuming the empirical

find that this dust attenuation is too strong to explain the B-band and X-ray

that weaken the dust attenuation. As such a mechanism, we introduce a time
delay for AGN activity, that is, gas fueling to a central black hole starts
some time after the beginning of the starburst induced by a major merger. The
other is the anisotropy in the dust distribution. We find that in order to make
the dust attenuation of the quasars negligible, either the gas accretion into

space K if there is an isometry V from H to K such that C=V^*TV. A main result
of this paper is, for a positive integer d, the simultaneous dilation, up to a
sharp factor $\vartheta(d)$, of all d-by-d symmetric matrices of operator norm
at most one to a collection of commuting self-adjoint contraction operators on
a Hilbert space. An analytic formula for $\vartheta(d)$ is derived, which as a
by-product gives new probabilistic results for the binomial and beta
distributions.
  Dilating to commuting operators has consequences for the theory of linear
matrix inequalities (LMIs). Given a tuple A=(A_1,...,A_g) of symmetric matrices
of the same size, L(x):=I-\sum A_j x_j is a monic linear pencil. The solution
set S_L of the corresponding linear matrix inequality, consisting of those x in
R^g for which L(x) is positive semidefinite (PsD), is a spectrahedron. The set
D_L of tuples X=(X_1,...,X_g) of symmetric matrices (of the same size) for
which L(X):=I-\sum A_j \otimes X_j is PsD, is a free spectrahedron. A result
here is: any tuple X of d-by-d symmetric matrices in a bounded free
spectrahedron D_L dilates, up to a scale factor, to a tuple T of commuting
self-adjoint operators with joint spectrum in the corresponding spectrahedron
S_L. From another viewpoint, the scale factor measures the extent that a
positive map can fail to be completely positive.
  Given another monic linear pencil M, the inclusion D_L \subset D_M obviously
implies the inclusion S_L \subset S_M and thus can be thought of as its free
relaxation. Determining if one free spectrahedron contains another can be done
by solving an explicit LMI and is thus computationally tractable. The scale
factor for commutative dilation of D_L gives a precise measure of the worst
case error inherent in the free relaxation, over all monic linear pencils M of
size d.

MaNGA (Mapping Nearby Galaxies at Apache Point Observatory), one of three core
programs in the fourth-generation Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS-IV) that began
on 2014 July 1. MaNGA will investigate the internal kinematic structure and
composition of gas and stars in an unprecedented sample of 10,000 nearby
galaxies. We summarize essential characteristics of the instrument and survey
design in the context of MaNGA's key science goals and present prototype
observations to demonstrate MaNGA's scientific potential. MaNGA employs
dithered observations with 17 fiber-bundle integral field units that vary in
diameter from 12"" (19 fibers) to 32"" (127 fibers). Two dual-channel
spectrographs provide simultaneous wavelength coverage over 3600-10300 A at
R~2000. With a typical integration time of 3 hr, MaNGA reaches a target r-band
signal-to-noise ratio of 4-8 (per A, per 2"" fiber) at 23 AB mag per sq. arcsec,
which is typical for the outskirts of MaNGA galaxies. Targets are selected with
stellar mass greater than 1e9 Msun using SDSS-I redshifts and i-band luminosity
to achieve uniform radial coverage in terms of the effective radius, an
approximately flat distribution in stellar mass, and a sample spanning a wide
range of environments. Analysis of our prototype observations demonstrates
MaNGA's ability to probe gas ionization, shed light on recent star formation
and quenching, enable dynamical modeling, decompose constituent components, and
map the composition of stellar populations. MaNGA's spatially resolved spectra
will enable an unprecedented study of the astrophysics of nearby galaxies in
the coming 6 yr.

chemically and kinematically using the fourth data release of the RAdial
Velocity Experiment (RAVE). We used a sample of 57 HiVel stars with Galactic
rest-frame velocities larger than 275 km s$^{-1}$. With 6D position and
velocity information, we integrated the orbits of the HiVel stars and found
that, on average, they reach out to 13 kpc from the Galactic plane and have
relatively eccentric orbits consistent with the Galactic halo. Using the
stellar parameters and [$\alpha$/Fe] estimates from RAVE, we found the
metallicity distribution of the HiVel stars peak at [M/H] = -1.2 dex and is
chemically consistent with the inner halo. There are a few notable exceptions
that include a hypervelocity star (HVS) candidate, an extremely high-velocity
bound halo star, and one star that is kinematically consistent with the halo
but chemically consistent with the disk. High-resolution spectra were obtained
for the metal-rich HiVel star candidate and the second highest velocity star in
the sample. Using these high-resolution data, we report the discovery of a
metal-rich halo star that has likely been dynamically ejected into the halo
from the Galactic thick disk. This discovery could aid in explaining the

mass regime ($m_\chi \lesssim m_Z/2$). Because this is an experimentally
well-trod energy range, it can be a challenge to develop simple models that
explain this excess, consistent with other experimental constraints. We
reconsider models where the dark matter couples to dark photon, which has a
weak kinetic mixing to the Standard Model photon, or scalars with a weak mixing
with the Higgs boson. We focus on the light ($\lesssim 1.5 GeV$) dark mediator
mass regime. Annihilations into the dark mediators can produce observable gamma
rays through decays to $\pi^0$, through radiative processes when decaying to
charged particles ($e^+e^-, \mu^+\mu^-,...$), and subsequent interactions of
high energy $e^+e^-$ with gas and light. However, these models have no signals
of $\bar p$ production, which is kinematically forbidden. We find that in these
models, the shape of resulting gamma-ray spectrum can provide a good fit to the
excess at Galactic Center. We discuss further constraints from AMS-02, and find
regions of compatibility.

multi-wavelength data provided by other COSMOS surveys to discuss the
reliability of the method and the nature of our AGN candidates. Our selection
returns a sample of 83 AGN candidates; based on a number of diagnostics, we
conclude that 67 of them are confirmed AGNs (81% purity), 12 are classified as
supernovae, while the nature of the remaining 4 is unknown. For the subsample
of AGNs with some spectroscopic classification, we find that Type 1 are
prevalent (89%) compared to Type 2 AGNs (11%). Overall, our approach is able to
retrieve on average 15% of all AGNs in the field identified by means of
spectroscopic or X-ray classification, with a strong dependence on the source
apparent magnitude. In particular, the completeness for Type 1 AGNs is 25%,
while it drops to 6% for Type 2 AGNs. The rest of the X-ray selected AGN
population presents on average a larger r.m.s. variability than the bulk of non
variable sources, indicating that variability detection for at least some of
these objects is prevented only by the photometric accuracy of the data. We
show how a longer observing baseline would return a larger sample of AGN

number scaling on gauge theory and some geometric quantities. A description of
number scaling and fiber bundles over a flat space time manifold, M, is
followed by a description of gauge theory. A fiber at point x of M contains a
pair of scaled complex number and vector space structures, $C^{c}_{x}\times
V^{c}_{x} $ for each c in GL(1,C). A space time dependent scalar field, g,
determines, for each x, the scaling value of the vector space structures that
contain the values of a vector valued matter field at x. The vertical
components of connections between neighboring fibers are taken to be the
gradient field A(x)+iB(x), of g. Abelian gauge theory for these fields gives
the result that B is massless and no mass restrictions for A. Addition of an
electromagnetic field dies not change these results. In the Mexican hat Higgs
mechanism B combines with a Goldstone boson to create massive vector bosons,
the photon field, and the Higgs field. For geometric quantities the fiber
bundle is a tangent bundle with a fiber at point x containing scaled pairs,
$R^{r}_{x}\times T^{r}_{x}$ of real number and tangent space structures for
each x and and nonnegative real r. B is zero everywhere. The A field affects
path lengths and the proper times of clocks along paths. It also appears in the
geodesic equation. The lack of physical evidence for the gradient field,
A(x)+iB(x) means that it either couples very weakly to matter fields or that it
is close to zero for all x in a local region of cosmological space and time. It
says nothing about the values outside the local region.

illustrate how protoclusters create large-scale flux decrements, roughly 10
$h^{-1}$Mpc across, and how we can use this signal to find them in flux maps.
We test the performance of our protocluster finding method by running it on the
ideal, noiseless map and tomographic reconstructions from mock surveys, and
comparing to the halo catalog. Using the noiseless map, we find protocluster
candidates with about 90% purity, and recover about 75% of the protoclusters
that form massive clusters ($> 3 \times 10^{14} \, h^{-1} M_{\odot}$). We
construct mock surveys similar to the ongoing COSMOS Lyman-Alpha Mapping And
Tomography Observations (CLAMATO) survey. While the existing data has an
average sightline separation of 2.3 $h^{-1}$Mpc, we test separations of 2 - 6
$h^{-1}$Mpc to see what can be tolerated for our application. Using
reconstructed maps from small separation mock surveys, the protocluster
candidate purity and completeness are very close what was found in the
noiseless case. As the sightline separation increases, the purity and
completeness decrease, although they remain much higher than we initially
expected. We extended our test cases to mock surveys with an average separation
of 15 $h^{-1}$Mpc, meant to reproduce high source density areas of the BOSS
survey. We find that even with such a large sightline separation, the method
can still be used to find some of the largest protoclusters.

be a promising substitute to the orthodox theory in the non-relativistic

its definitions, theorems and specific vocabulary as well. Its main hypothesis
states indeed that the classical trajectories of the particles are identical to
the sample functions of a diffusion Markov process, whose conditional
probability density is proposed as a substitute for the wave function. Along
the way, we introduce ad hoc hypotheses for the sole reason that they
facilitate and even make possible the further development of the theory. These
and the so-called Nelson equations are used to determine the drift vectors and
the diffusion tensor characteristic of such a process. It is then possible to
write down the Fokker-Planck and Kolmogorov equations that can be used to
determine the normal and conditional probability densities. This logical
sequence of steps leads to the solution of specific problems and we apply it to
the special case of the free particle.

cavities of proteins in conformational dynamics. We investigated the
pressure-induced responses from the cavity-enlarged L99A mutant of T4 lysozyme,
using high-pressure NMR spectroscopy. The signal intensities of the methyl
groups in the 1H/13C HSQC spectra, particularly those around the enlarged
cavity, decreased with the increasing pressure, and disappeared at 200 MPa,
without the appearance of new resonances, thus indicating the presence of
heterogeneous conformations around the cavity within the ground state ensemble.
Above 200 MPa, the signal intensities of more than 20 methyl groups gradually
decreased with the increasing pressure, without the appearance of new
resonances. Interestingly, these residues closely matched those sensing a large
conformational change between the ground- and high-energy states, at
atmospheric pressure. 13C and 1H NMR line-shape simulations showed that the
pressure-induced loss in the peak intensity could be explained by the increase
in the high-energy state population. In this high-energy state, the aromatic
side chain of F114 gets flipped into the enlarged cavity. The accommodation of
the phenylalanine ring into the efficiently packed cavity may decrease the
partial molar volume of the high-energy state, relative to the ground state. We
suggest that the enlarged cavity is involved in the conformational transition

receivers are required to decode multiple (possibly different) messages from a
common broadcast, and they each know some messages a priori. In this paper, at
the receiver end, we consider a special setting where each receiver knows only
one message a priori, and each message is known to only one receiver. At the
broadcasting end, we consider a generalized setting where there could be
multiple senders, and each sender knows a subset of the messages. The senders
collaborate to transmit an index code. This work looks at minimizing the number
of total coded bits the senders are required to transmit. When there is only
one sender, we propose a pruning algorithm to find a lower bound on the optimal
(i.e., the shortest) index codelength, and show that it is achievable by linear
index codes. When there are two or more senders, we propose an appending
technique to be used in conjunction with the pruning technique to give a lower
bound on the optimal index codelength; we also derive an upper bound based on
cyclic codes. While the two bounds do not match in general, for the special
case where no two distinct senders know any message in common, the bounds

possess stable, large-scale magnetic fields. Numerical works have confirmed
that stable MHD equilibria can exist in non-barotropic, stably stratified
stars. On the other hand, it is unclear whether stable equilibria are possible
in barotropic stars, although the existing evidence suggests that they are all
unstable. This work aims to construct barotropic equilibria in order to study
their properties, as a first step to test their stability. We have assumed that
the star is a perfectly conducting, axially symmetric fluid, allowing for both
poloidal and toroidal components of the magnetic field. In addition, we made
the astrophysically justified assumption that the magnetic force has a
negligible influence on the fluid structure, in which case the equilibrium is
governed by the Grad-Shafranov equation, involving two arbitrary functions of
the poloidal flux. We built a numerical code to solve this equation, allowing
for an arbitrary prescription for these functions. Taking particularly simple,
but physically reasonable choices for these functions with a couple of
adjustable parameters, all of the equilibria found present only a small
($\lesssim 10\%{}$) fraction of the magnetic energy stored in the toroidal
component, confirming previous results. We developed an analytical model in
order to study in more detail the behavior of the magnetic energy over the full
range of parameters. The model confirms that the toroidal fraction of the
energy and the ratio of toroidal to poloidal flux are bounded from above for
the whole range of parameters.

history, the standard Markov models underlying standard phylogenetic methods
are mathematically inconsistent. The most prominent example is the general time
reversible model (GTR) together with some, but not all, of its submodels. To
rectify this deficiency, Lie Markov models have been developed as the class of
models that are consistent in the face of a changing process of DNA
substitutions. Some well-known models in popular use are within this class, but
are either overly simplistic (e.g. the Kimura two-parameter model) or overly
complex (the general Markov model). On a diverse set of biological data sets,
we test a hierarchy of Lie Markov models spanning the full range of parameter
richness. Compared against the benchmark of the ever-popular GTR model, we find
that as a whole the Lie Markov models perform remarkably well, with the best
performing models having eight parameters and the ability to recognise the
distinction between purines and pyrimidines.

with respect to the CMB background based upon the redshift-distance relation
for Type Ia supernovae (SN Ia). We made two independent analyses: one based
upon identifying the three Cartesian velocity components; and the other based
upon the cosine dependence of the deviation from Hubble flow on the sky. We
apply these analyses to the Union2.1 SN Ia data and to the SDSS-II supernova
survey. For both methods, results for low redshift, $z < 0.05$, are consistent
with previous searches. We find a local bulk flow of $v_{\rm bf} \sim 300$ km
s$^{-1}$ in the direction of $(l,b) \sim (270, 35)^{\circ}$. However, the
search for a dark flow at $z>0.05$ is inconclusive. Based upon simulated data
sets, we deduce that the difficulty in detecting a dark flow at high redshifts
arises mostly from the observational error in the distance modulus. Thus, even
if it exists, a dark flow is not detectable at large redshift with current SN
Ia data sets. We estimate that a detection would require both significant sky
coverage of SN Ia out to $z = 0.3$ and a reduction in the effective distance
modulus error from 0.2 mag to $\lesssim 0.02$ mag. We estimate that a greatly
expanded data sample of $\sim 10^4$ SN Ia might detect a dark flow as small as
300 km s$^{-1}$ out to $z = 0.3$ even with a distance modulus error of $0.2$
mag. This may be achievable in a next generation large survey like LSST.

finite symmetric phase-space equivalent to the space of real, antisymmetric

fibers (3-7 hexagonal layers) using Polymicro FBP 120:132:150 um
core:clad:buffer fibers to reach a fill fraction of 56%. High throughput (and
low focal-ratio degradation) is achieved by maintaining the fiber cladding and
buffer intact, ensuring excellent surface polish, and applying a multi-layer AR
coating of the input and output surfaces. In operations on-sky, the IFUs show
only an additional 2.3% FRD-related variability in throughput despite repeated
mechanical stressing during plate plugging (however other losses are present).
The IFUs achieve on-sky throughput 5% above the single-fiber feeds used in
SDSS-III/BOSS, attributable to equivalent performance compared to single fibers
and additional gains from the AR coating. The manufacturing process is geared
toward mass-production of high-multiplex systems. The low-stress process
involves a precision ferrule with hexagonal inner shape designed to lead
inserted fibers to settle in a dense hexagonal pattern. The ferrule inner
diameter is tapered at progressively shallower angles toward its tip and the
final 2 mm are straight and only a few um larger than necessary to hold the
desired number of fibers. This process scales to accommodate other fiber sizes

the comparison of DNA sequences from different organisms, namely multitolerance
graphs, two tolerances are allowed for each interval - one from the left and
one from the right side. Several efficient algorithms for optimization problems
that are NP-hard in general graphs have been designed for tolerance and
multitolerance graphs. In spite of this progress, the complexity status of some
fundamental algorithmic problems on tolerance and multitolerance graphs, such

after the introduction of tolerance graphs. In this article we introduce two
new geometric representations for tolerance and multitolerance graphs, given by
points and line segments in the plane. Apart from being important on their own,
these new representations prove to be a powerful tool for deriving both
hardness results and polynomial time algorithms. Using them, we surprisingly
prove that the dominating set problem can be solved in polynomial time on
tolerance graphs and that it is APX-hard on multitolerance graphs, solving thus
a longstanding open problem. This problem is the first one that has been
discovered with a different complexity status in these two graph classes.

residing at a redshift $z\geq0.6$ in two scenarios in the frame of a
lepto-hadronic jet model taking both the uncertainties of the extragalactic
background light (EBL) and its redshift into account. In the first scenario,
TeV emission is attributed to the synchrotron emission of pair cascades
resulting from $p\gamma$ interaction; in the second scenario, TeV emission is
attributed to the proton-synchrotron emission, and an internal absorption due
to interaction with the photons around the jet is included. The results show
that in the first scenario the 68\% upper limit of its redshift within which
this scenario can explain the VERITAS TeV spectrum in 2009 well is $\sim0.75$;
in the second scenario, this upper limit of the redshift becomes $\sim1.03$.
However, the second scenario can be excluded because it requires an
unreasonable photon field around the jet with a luminosity of $\sim10^{43}\rm \
erg\ s^{-1}$. In conclusion, the jet model can explain its TeV spectrum with a
low EBL density if $0.6<z<0.75$.

the mass of an individual PMO through microlensing by examining a particular
event, MOA-2011-BLG-274. This event was unusual as the duration was short, the
magnification high, the source-size effect large and the angular Einstein
radius small. Also, it was intensively monitored from widely separated
locations under clear skies at low air masses. Choi et al. (2012) concluded
that the lens of the event may have been a PMO but they did not attempt a
measurement of its mass. We report here a re-analysis of the event using
re-reduced data. We confirm the results of Choi et al. and attempt a
measurement of the mass and distance of the lens using the terrestrial parallax
effect. Evidence for terrestrial parallax is found at a 3 sigma level of
confidence. The best fit to the data yields the mass and distance of the lens
as 0.80 +/- 0.30 M_J and 0.80 +/- 0.25 kpc respectively. We exclude a host star
to the lens out to a separation ~ 40 AU. Drawing on our analysis of

analysis of the microstructure of the cathode functional layer in four

electrocatalytic activity is controlled by an effective Thiele modulus, which
is the ratio of the surface diffusion length (mean distance from an adsorption

root of surface diffusivity divided by the adsorption rate constant). The
Thiele modulus must be larger than one in order to maintain high surface
coverage of reaction intermediates, but care must be taken in order to

investigate the component-wise conditionally unbiased linear minimum mean

consistency within frames, and discriminative feature construction. To address
this issue, we propose a robust keypoint tracker based on spatio-temporal
multi-task structured output optimization driven by discriminative metric
learning. Consequently, temporal model coherence is characterized by multi-task
structured keypoint model learning over several adjacent frames, while spatial
model consistency is modeled by solving a geometric verification based
structured learning problem. Discriminative feature construction is enabled by
metric learning to ensure the intra-class compactness and inter-class
separability. Finally, the above three modules are simultaneously optimized in
a joint learning scheme. Experimental results have demonstrated the
effectiveness of our tracker.

challenge in the context of topic modeling on web-scale corpora, and show that

yet reported even with thousands of machines. Our major contributions include:
1) a new, highly efficient O(1) Metropolis-Hastings sampling algorithm, whose
running cost is (surprisingly) agnostic of model size, and empirically
converges nearly an order of magnitude faster than current state-of-the-art
Gibbs samplers; 2) a structure-aware model-parallel scheme, which leverages
dependencies within the topic model, yielding a sampling strategy that is
frugal on machine memory and network communication; 3) a differential
data-structure for model storage, which uses separate data structures for high-
and low-frequency words to allow extremely large models to fit in memory, while
maintaining high inference speed; and 4) a bounded asynchronous data-parallel
scheme, which allows efficient distributed processing of massive data via a
parameter server. Our distribution strategy is an instance of the
model-and-data-parallel programming model underlying the Petuum framework for
general distributed ML, and was implemented on top of the Petuum open-source

massive models within reach on a small cluster while still enjoying

dimensional setting, by replacing the phase space $ \mathbb{R}^{2n}$ by $B^2$,
where $(i,H,B)$ is an abstract Wiener space. A first approach is to generalize
the integral definition using the Wigner function. The symbol is then a
function defined on $B^2$ and belonging to a $L^1$ space for a gaussian
measure, the Weyl operator is defined as a quadratic form on a dense subspace
of $L^2(B)$. For example, the symbol can be the stochastic extension on $B^2$,
in the sense of L. Gross, of a function $F$ which is continuous and bounded on
$H^2$.
  In the second approach, this function $F$ defined on $H^2$ satisfies
differentiability conditions analogous to the finite dimensional ones. One
needs to introduce hybrid operators acting as Weyl operators on the variables
of finite dimensional subset of $H$ and as Anti-Wick operators on the rest of
the variables. The final Weyl operator is then defined as a limit and it is
continuous on a $L^2$ space. Under rather weak conditions, it is an extension
of the operator defined by the first approach.
  We give examples of monomial symbols linking this construction to the
classical pseudodifferential operators theory and other examples related to
other fields or previous works on this subject.

tape shows very high homogeneity and sustains Jc as high as 7.7*10^4 A/cm^2 at

non-resonantly produced sterile neutrinos accounting for $20$-$60\%$ of the
dark matter in the Universe. These non-resonantly produced sterile neutrinos
have a sizable free-streaming length and hence behave effectively as warm dark
matter (WDM). Assuming the rest of dark matter is composed of some cold dark
matter (CDM) particles, we follow the coevolution of a mixed WDM plus CDM
cosmology. Specifically, we consider the models with the warm component
fraction of $r_{\rm warm}=0.25$ and $0.50$. Our MDM models predict that the
comoving Jeans length at the matter-radiation equality is close to that of the
thermally produced warm dark matter model with particle mass $m_{\rm
WDM}=2.4\,{\rm keV}$, but the suppression in the fluctuation power spectrum is
weaker. We perform large $N$-body simulations to study the structure of
non-linear dark halos in the MDM models. The abundance of substructure is
significantly reduced in the MDM models, and hence the so-called small-scale
crisis is mitigated. The cumulative maximum circular velocity function (CVF) of
at least one halo in the MDM models is in good agreement with the CVFs of the
observed satellites in the Milky Way and the Andromeda galaxy. We argue that
the MDM models open an interesting possibility to reconcile the reported

study asymptotic stability in this paper: does an IMEX scheme allow for a CFL

the advective term, the upwind diffusion and a quadratic term stemming from the

about the structure and behaviour of physical systems, for example in so-called

powerfully and quantitatively reason about biological systems, particularly at
the interface between physics and biology. However, substantial uncertainties
are often associated with values in cell biology, and performing calculations
without taking this uncertainty into account may limit the extent to which
results can be interpreted for a given problem. We present a means to
facilitate such calculations where uncertainties are explicitly tracked through
the line of reasoning, and introduce a `probabilistic calculator' called
Caladis, a web tool freely available at www.caladis.org, designed to perform
this tracking. This approach allows users to perform more statistically robust
calculations in cell biology despite having uncertain values, and to identify
which quantities need to be measured more precisely in order to make confident
statements, facilitating efficient experimental design. We illustrate the use
of our tool for tracking uncertainty in several example biological
calculations, showing that the results yield powerful and interpretable
statistics on the quantities of interest. We also demonstrate that the outcomes
of calculations may differ from point estimates when uncertainty is accurately
tracked. An integral link between Caladis and the Bionumbers repository of
biological quantities further facilitates the straightforward location,

photon fields are taken into account, namely the internal synchrotron,
synchrotron-self Compton and external Compton radiation, as well as a constant
external soft photon field. By applying the optical depths to theoretical
blazar spectra only the constant external photon field turns out to
significantly influence the radiation at high energies. The impact of the
internal time-dependent radiation fields is either minor or requires extreme
parameter settings. Additionally, the synchrotron-self absorption turn-over
energy for low synchrotron energies is calculated, which is inherently
time-dependent. It would be challenging to use it to constrain free parameters,
since precise knowledge of the observation time relative to the injection time
is needed. In conclusion, optical depth does not significantly influence the

results in a scalar second order partial differential equation (PDE) for the

crucial reference pressure, the stiff subsystem is hyperbolic, and the second
order PDE for the pressure is elliptic. The scheme is also uniformly
asymptotically consistent. Numerical experiments show that the scheme needs to
be stabilized for low Mach numbers. Unfortunately, this affects the asymptotic
consistency, which becomes non-uniform in the Mach number, and requires an
unduly fine grid in the small Mach number limit. On the other hand, the CFL
number is only related to the non-stiff characteristic speeds, independently of
the Mach number. Our analytical and numerical results stress the importance of
further studies of asymptotic stability in the development of AP (asymptotic

used to derive a signature-based decomposition of the joint reliability of the
two systems. In the first part of this paper we provide an explicit formula to
compute the joint structure signature of two or more systems and extend this
formula to the general non-i.i.d. case, assuming only that the distribution of
the component lifetimes has no ties. We also provide and discuss a necessary

multistate system can always be additively decomposed into a sum of classical
structure functions. Considering a multistate system then reduces to
considering simultaneously several two-state systems.

models and can predict a larger primordial tensor signal than is true for
simpler single-field versions of these models. In so doing we provide a unified

aggregate in a background matrix of semi-flexible self assembled polymeric worm
like micellar chains. The different nano-structures are formed by the dynamical
arrest of phase-separating mixtures of micellar monomers and nano-particles.
The different mor- phologies obtained are the result of an interplay of the
available free volume, the elastic energy of deformation of polymers, the
density (chemical potential) of the nano-particles in the polymer ma- trix and,
of course, the ratio of the size of self assembling nano-particles and self
avoidance diameter of polymeric chains. We have used a hybrid semi-grand
canonical Monte Carlo simulation scheme to obtain the (non-equilibrium) phase
diagram of the self-assembled nano-structures. We observe rod-like structures
of nano-particles which get self assembled in the gaps between the nematically
ordered chains as well as percolating gel-like network of conjoined nanotubes.
We also find a totally unexpected interlocked crystalline phase of
nano-particles and monomers, in which each crytal plane of nanoparticles is
separated by planes of perfectly organized polymer chains. We identified the
con- dition which leads to such interlocked crystal structure. We suggest
experimental possibilities of how the results presented in this paper could be

the solar disk between disk centre and the solar limb. These events have been
identified in Sunrise/IMaX data according to the same objective criteria at all
available positions on the solar disk. Their properties were determined using
standard techniques. Our study yielded a number of new insights into this
phenomenon. Most importantly, the number density of these events is independent
of the heliocentric angle, i.e. the investigated supersonic flows are nearly
isotropically distributed. Size and lifetime are also nearly independent of the
heliocentric angle, while their intensity contrast increases towards the solar
limb. The Stokes $V$ jets are associated with upflow velocities deduced from
Stokes $I$, which are stronger towards the limb. Their intensity decreases with
time, while their line-of-sight (LOS) velocity does not display a clear
temporal evolution. Their association with linear polarization signals
decreases towards the limb. The density of events appears to be independent of
heliocentric angle, establishing that they are directed nearly randomly. If
these events are jets triggered by magnetic reconnection between emerging
magnetic flux and the ambient field, then our results suggest that there is no
preferred geometry for the reconnection process.

Identity Provider (IdP) to issue authentication tokens which can be consumed by
Service Providers (SPs). Traditionally, IdPs are modeled as trusted third
parties. This is reasonable for SSO systems like Kerberos, MS Passport and
SAML, where each SP explicitely specifies which IdP he trusts. However, in open
systems like OpenID and OpenID Connect, each user may set up his own IdP, and a
discovery phase is added to the protocol flow. Thus it is easy for an attacker
to set up its own IdP. In this paper we use a novel approach for analyzing SSO
authentication schemes by introducing a malicious IdP. With this approach we
evaluate one of the most popular and widely deployed SSO protocols - OpenID. We
found four novel attack classes on OpenID, which were not covered by previous
research, and show their applicability to real-life implementations. As a
result, we were able to compromise 11 out of 16 existing OpenID implementations
like Sourceforge, Drupal and ownCloud. We automated discovery of these attacks
in a open source tool OpenID Attacker, which additionally allows fine-granular
testing of all parameters in OpenID implementations. Our research helps to
better understand the message flow in the OpenID protocol, trust assumptions in
the different components of the system, and implementation issues in OpenID
components. It is applicable to other SSO systems like OpenID Connect and SAML.
All OpenID implementations have been informed about their vulnerabilities and
we supported them in fixing the issues.

Hall effect, $\rho_{\rm xy}$, and specific heat, $C$, are characteristic of an
exchange-enhanced Fermi liquid ground state, which develops a slightly
anisotropic spin gap $\Delta \approx 220\,{\rm K}$ below $T_{\rm N}=88\,{\rm

the magnetization for $T\to0$ reported in the literature. Comparison of $C$
with $d\rho_{\rm xx}/dT$, where we infer lattice contributions from
measurements of VB$_2$, reveals strong antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations with
a characteristic spin fluctuation temperature $T_{\rm sf}\approx 257\,{\rm K}$
in the paramagnetic state, followed by a pronounced second-order mean-field
transition at $T_{\rm N}$, and unusual excitations around $\approx T_{\rm

characteristic of an easy-plane anisotropy of the spin fluctuations consistent
with the magnetization. The ratio of the Curie-Weiss to the N$\acute{\rm{e}}$el
temperatures, $f=-\Theta_{\rm CW}/T_{\rm N}\approx 8.5$, inferred from the
magnetization, implies strong geometric frustration. All physical properties
are remarkably invariant under applied magnetic fields up to $14\,\,{\rm T}$,
the highest field studied. In contrast to earlier suggestions of local-moment
magnetism our study identifies CrB$_{2}$ as a weak itinerant antiferromagnet
par excellence with strong geometric frustration.

for collections of minimal distal flows. The disjointness techniques are
combined with Furstenberg's example of a minimal distal system with multiple

us construct the temperature and column density maps of the region, which show

quantum field theory. Their solutions are triangular series in a coupling
constant $\alpha$ and an external scale parameter $L$ for a chosen amplitude
$r$, with the order in $L$ bounded by the order in the coupling. Perturbation
theory calculates the first few orders in $\alpha$. On the other hand,
Dyson--Schwinger equations determine next-to$^{\{\mathrm{j}\}}$-leading log
expansions, $G^r(\alpha,L) = 1 + \sum_{j=0}^\infty \sum_{\mathcal{M}}
p_j^{\mathcal{M}}\alpha^j \mathcal{M}(u)$. $\sum_{\mathcal{M}}$ sums a finite
number of functions $\mathcal{M}$ in $u = \alpha L/2$. The leading logs come
from the trivial representation $\mathcal{M}(u) =
\begin{bsmallmatrix}\bullet\end{bsmallmatrix}(u)$ at $j=0$ with
$p_0^{\begin{bsmallmatrix}\bullet\end{bsmallmatrix}} = 1$. All non-leading logs
are organized by the suppression in powers $\alpha^j$. We describe an algebraic
method to derive all next-to$^{\{\mathrm{j}\}}$-leading log terms from the
knowledge of the first $(j+1)$ terms in perturbation theory and their
filtrations. This implies the calculation of the functions $\mathcal{M}(u)$ and
periods $p_j^\mathcal{M}$. In the first part of our paper, we investigate the
structure of Dyson-Schwinger equations and develop a method to filter their
solutions. Applying renormalized Feynman rules maps each filtered term to a
certain power of $\alpha$ and $L$ in the log-expansion. Based on this, the
second part derives the next-to$^{\{\mathrm{j}\}}$-leading log expansions. Our
method is general. Here, we exemplify it using the examples of the propagator
in Yukawa theory and the photon self-energy in quantum electrodynamics. The
reader may apply our method to any (set of) Dyson-Schwinger equation(s)
appearing in renormalizable quantum field theories.

the decoherence caused by the qubit's charge environment poses a serious
obstacle in the way towards large scale quantum computing. The effects of the
charge decoherence can be mitigated by operating the qubit in the so called
sweet spot regions where it is insensitive to electrical noise. In this paper,
we propose singlet-triplet qubits based on two quantum dots of different sizes.
Such asymmetric double dot systems allow the implementation of exchange gates
with controllable exchange splitting $J$ operated in the doubly occupied charge
region of the larger dot, where the qubit has high resilience to charge noise.
In the larger dot, $J$ can be quenched to a value smaller than the intra-dot
tunneling using magnetic fields, while the smaller dot and its larger splitting
can be used in the projective readout of the qubit.

effects over studies that each usually have 20 or fewer subjects. Interest in
meta-analysis in brain mapping is also driven by a recent focus on so-called
""reverse inference"": where as traditional ""forward inference"" identifies the
regions of the brain involved in a task, a reverse inference identifies the
cognitive processes that a task engages. Such reverse inferences, however,
require a set of meta-analysis, one for each possible cognitive domain.
However, existing methods for neuroimaging meta-analysis have significant
limitations. Commonly used methods for neuroimaging meta-analysis are not model
based, do not provide interpretable parameter estimates, and only produce null
hypothesis inferences; further, they are generally designed for a single group
of studies and cannot produce reverse inferences. In this work we address these
limitations by adopting a nonparametric Bayesian approach for meta-analysis
data from multiple classes or types of studies. In particular, foci from each
type of study are modeled as a cluster process driven by a random intensity
function that is modeled as a kernel convolution of a gamma random field. The
type-specific gamma random fields are linked and modeled as a realization of a
common gamma random field, shared by all types, that induces correlation
between study types and mimics the behavior of a univariate mixed effects
model. We illustrate our model on simulation studies and a meta-analysis of
five emotions from 219 studies and check model fit by a posterior predictive
assessment. In addition, we implement reverse inference by using the model to
predict study type from a newly presented study. We evaluate this predictive
performance via leave-one-out cross-validation that is efficiently implemented
using importance sampling techniques.

Euclidean spaces, we employ random projections in order to reduce the original
problem to one in a space of dimension inversely proportional to $k$.
  The $k$ approximate nearest neighbors can be efficiently retrieved by a data
structure such as BBD-trees. The same approach is applied to the problem of
computing an approximate near neighbor, where we obtain a data structure
requiring linear space, and query time in $O(d n^{\rho})$, for $\rho\approx

issue. In this context the famous Caldeira-Leggett model that enables quantum
and classical treatment of Brownian motion on equal footing has enjoyed
popularity. Although this model is by any means a useful theoretical tool, its
ability to describe anharmonic dynamics of real systems is often taken for
granted. In this Letter we show that the mapping between a molecular system
under study and the model cannot be established in a self-consistent way,
unless the system part of the potential is taken effectively
harmonic.Mathematically, this implies that the mapping is not invertible. This
`invertibility problem' is not dependent on the peculiarities of particular
molecular systems under study and is rooted in the anharmonicity of the system
part of the potential.

That is, there is an abelian category A(SO(2)) whose derived category is
equivalent to the homotopy category of rational SO(2)-equivariant spectra. An
important question is: does this algebraic model capture the smash product of
spectra?
  The category A(SO(2)) is known as Greenlees' standard model, it is an abelian
category that has no projective objects and is constructed from modules over a
non-Noetherian ring. Hence the standard techniques for constructing a monoidal
model structure cannot be applied. In this paper we construct a monoidal model
structure on A(SO(2)) and show that the derived product on the homotopy
category is compatible with the smash product of spectra. The method used is
related to techniques developed by the author in earlier joint work with
Roitzheim. That work constructed a monoidal model structure on Franke's exotic
model for the K_p-local stable homotopy category.
  We also provide a monoidal Quillen equivalence to a simpler monoidal model
category R_*-modules that has explicit generating sets. Having monoidal model
structures on A(SO(2)) and R_*-modules removes a serious obstruction to
constructing a series of monoidal Quillen equivalences between the algebraic
model and rational SO(2)-equivariant spectra.

claims that for an arbitrary self-adjoint operator A there exists a

Schr\""odinger operator and B is an arbitrary Jacobi matrix (of Hilbert-Schmidt
class) the a.c. spectrum remains perfectly the same, that is, the interval
[-2,2]. Moreover, Killip and Simon described explicitly the spectral properties
for such A+B. Jointly with Damanik they generalized this result to the case of
perturbations of periodic Jacobi matrices in the non-degenerated case. Recall
that the spectrum of a periodic Jacobi matrix is a system of intervals of a
very specific nature. Christiansen, Simon and Zinchenko posed in a review
dedicated to F. Gesztesy (2013) the following question: ""is there an extension
of the Damanik-Killip-Simon theorem to the general finite system of intervals
case?"" In this paper we solve this problem completely. Our method deals with
the Jacobi flow on GSMP matrices. GSMP matrices are probably a new object in
the spectral theory. They form a certain Generalization of matrices related to
the Strong Moment Problem, the latter ones are a very close relative of Jacobi
and CMV matrices. The Jacobi flow on them is also a probably new member of the
rich family of integrable systems. Finally, related to Jacobi matrices of
Killip-Simon class, analytic vector bundles and their curvature play a certain
role in our construction and, at least on the level of ideology, this role is
quite essential.

requires to reduce the present neutron cross section uncertainties of minor
actinides. Purpose: Reduce the $^{243}$Am(n,$\gamma$) cross section
uncertainty. Method: The $^{243}$Am(n,$\gamma$) cross section has been measured
at the n_TOF facility at CERN with a BaF$_{2}$ Total Absorption Calorimeter, in
the energy range between 0.7 eV and 2.5 keV. Results: The
$^{243}$Am(n,$\gamma$) cross section has been successfully measured in the
mentioned energy range. The resolved resonance region has been extended from
250 eV up to 400 eV. In the unresolved resonance region our results are
compatible with one of the two incompatible capture data sets available below
2.5 keV. The data available in EXFOR and in the literature has been used to
perform a simple analysis above 2.5 keV. Conclusions: The results of this
measurement contribute to reduce the $^{243}$Am(n,$\gamma$) cross section
uncertainty and suggest that this cross section is underestimated up to 25% in
the neutron energy range between 50 eV and a few keV in the present evaluated
data libraries.

exponent $\beta$ under density value falls into the range $(1.0, 2.0]$, which
unexpectedly goes beyond the range observed by Pan et al. (Nat. Commun. vol. 4,

on 2D lattice space with the spatial correlation factor $\alpha$ as parameter.
Numerical experiments prove that the generated scaling exponent $\beta$ in our

conjecture that our model provides a general platform for extensive urban and

ionization energy I. Existing formulae were derived using atomic units.
However, many scientists work with ESFI as an important technical process, but
are not familiar with the Gaussian or atomic units systems. In the 1970s, the
present International System of Quantities (ISQ), which includes the equations
behind SI units, was designated as the main system for university teaching and
the communication of scientific equations. 40 years on, ISQ derivations of ESFI
rate-constant formulae are still not easily found, but are now needed. This
tutorial paper gives a detailed ISQ derivation of a formula for K_e. The
derivation is closely modelled on the Landau and Lifshitz (LL) approach used in
their 1958 work (in atomic units) on hydrogen atom ESFI. The ISQ derivation
confirms that, for hydrogenic atoms, ionization energy appears in the
pre-exponential as I^(5/2), and defines a universal ""field ionization
constant"". It also shows how the ISQ formula relates to the Gurney and Condon
""attempt frequency"" form for tunnelling rate-constants, and an ISQ formula is
given for the motive energy in the related JWKB integral. The ISQ derivation
uses a motive-energy transformation analogous to a transformation used by LL.
The need for this transformation in ESFI theory raises questions as to the
correctness of theoretical treatments of field electron emission from
non-planar emitters, which do not make this transformation.

Our future plans include the application of this methodology to two situations:
first, in a comparative study of the performance of the two Kinect sensors;
second, in pursuing their validation on the basis of comparisons with a
marker-based system (MBS). One important feature in our approach is the
transformation of the MBS output into Kinect-output format, thus enabling the
analysis of the measurements, obtained from different systems, with the same
software application, i.e., the one we use in the analysis of Kinect-captured

output, obtained from the different systems, be assessed on the basis of the
comparison of a number of waveforms, representing the variation within the gait
cycle of quantities which are commonly used in the modelling of the human
motion. The data acquisition may involve commercially-available treadmills and
a number of velocity settings: for instance, walking-motion data may be
acquired at $5$ km/h, running-motion data at $8$ and $11$ km/h. We recommend
that particular attention be called to systematic effects associated with the

variations in the growth rates of the gastro-intestinal (GI) parasitic
infection in livestock. The alluded growth rate is estimated through the
variation in the number of eggs per gram (EPG) of faeces in animals. In
accordance with earlier studies, our analysis too shows that rainfall is the
dominant variable in determining EPG infection rates compared to other
macro-parameters like temperature and humidity. Our statistical analysis
clearly indicates an oscillatory dependence of EPG levels on rainfall
fluctuations. Monsoon recorded the highest infection with a comparative
increase of at least 2.5 times compared to the next most infected period
(summer). A least square fit of the EPG versus rainfall data indicates an
approach towards a super diffusive (i. e. root mean square displacement growing
faster than the square root of the elapsed time as obtained for simple
diffusion) infection growth pattern regime for low rainfall regimes
(technically defined as zeroth level dependence) that gets remarkably augmented
for large rainfall zones. Our analysis further indicates that for low
fluctuations in temperature (true on the bulk data), EPG level saturates beyond
a critical value of the rainfall, a threshold that is expected to indicate the
onset of the nonlinear regime. The probability density functions (PDFs) of the
EPG data show oscillatory behavior in the large rainfall regime (greater than
500 mm), the frequency of oscillation, once again, being determined by the
ambient wetness (rainfall, and humidity). Data recorded over three pilot
projects spanning three measures of rainfall and humidity bear testimony to the
universality of this statistical argument.

such systems is proposed, exploiting advantages and synergies between two
recently proposed sensitivity analysis methodologies for stochastic dynamics.
The first method performs sensitivity analysis of the stochastic dynamics by
means of the Fisher Information Matrix on the underlying distribution of the
trajectories; the second method is a reduced-variance, finite-difference,
gradient-type sensitivity approach relying on stochastic coupling techniques
for variance reduction. Here we demonstrate that these two methods can be
combined and deployed together by means of a new sensitivity bound which
incorporates the variance of the quantity of interest as well as the Fisher
Information Matrix estimated from the first method. The first step of the
proposed strategy labels sensitivities using the bound and screens out the
insensitive parameters in a controlled manner based also on the new sensitivity
bound. In the second step of the proposed strategy, the finite-difference
method is applied only for the sensitivity estimation of the (potentially)
sensitive parameters that have not been screened out in the first step. Results
on an epidermal growth factor network with fifty parameters and on a protein
homeostasis with eighty parameters demonstrate that the proposed strategy is
able to quickly discover and discard the insensitive parameters and in the
remaining potentially sensitive parameters it accurately estimates the
sensitivities. The new sensitivity strategy can be several times faster than
current state-of-the-art approaches that test all parameters, especially in
""sloppy"" systems. In particular, the computational acceleration is quantified
by the ratio between the total number of parameters over the number of the
sensitive parameters.

high expectation of being a first principle method for generating statistical
scaling laws. The purpose of this comment is to show that this expectation has
not been met so far. In particular for wall-bounded turbulent flows, the
prospects for success are not promising in view of the facts we will present
herein. Although the invariance method of Lie-groups is able to generate
statistical scaling laws for wall-bounded turbulent flows, like the log-law for
example, these invariant results yet not only fail to fulfil the basic
requirements for a first principle result, but also are strongly misleading.
The reason is that not the functional structure of the log-law itself is
misleading, but that its invariant Lie-group based derivation yielding this
function is what is misleading. By revisiting the study of Oberlack (2001) we
will demonstrate that all Lie-group generated scaling laws derived therein do
not convince as first principle solutions. Instead, a rigorous derivation
reveals complete arbitrariness rather than uniqueness in the construction of
invariant turbulent scaling laws. Important to note here is that the key
results obtained in Oberlack (2001) are based on several technical errors,
which all will be revealed, discussed and corrected. The reason and motivation
why we put our focus solely on Oberlack (2001) is that it still marks the core
study and central reference point when applying the method of Lie-groups to
turbulence theory. Hence it is necessary to shed the correct light onto that
study. Nevertheless, even if the method of Lie-groups in its full extent is
applied and interpreted correctly, strong natural limits of this method within
the theory of turbulence exist, which, as will be finally discussed, constitute
insurmountable obstacles in the progress of achieving a significant
breakthrough.
