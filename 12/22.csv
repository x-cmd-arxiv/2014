of $G$ and $e$ an edge of $G$ incident with $v$. Two incidences $(v,e)$ and
$(w,f)$ are adjacent if one of the following holds: (i) $v = w$, (ii) $e = f$
or (iii) $vw = e$ or $f$. An incidence coloring of $G$ assigns a color to each
incidence of $G$ in such a way that adjacent incidences get distinct colors. In
2005, Hosseini Dolama \emph{et al.}~\citep{ds05} proved that every graph with
maximum average degree strictly less than $3$ can be incidence colored with
$\Delta+3$ colors. Recently, Bonamy \emph{et al.}~\citep{Bonamy} proved that
every graph with maximum degree at least $4$ and with maximum average degree
strictly less than $\frac{7}{3}$ admits an incidence $(\Delta+1)$-coloring. In
this paper we give bounds for the number of colors needed to color graphs
having maximum average degrees bounded by different values between $4$ and $6$.
In particular we prove that every graph with maximum degree at least $7$ and
with maximum average degree less than $4$ admits an incidence
$(\Delta+3)$-coloring. This result implies that every triangle-free planar
graph with maximum degree at least $7$ is incidence $(\Delta+3)$-colorable. We
also prove that every graph with maximum average degree less than 6 admits an
incidence $(\Delta + 7)$-coloring. More generally, we prove that $\Delta+k-1$
colors are enough when the maximum average degree is less than $k$ and the
maximum degree is sufficiently large.

strong lens modeling process for the six Hubble Frontier Fields (HFF) galaxy
clusters. The standard procedure for generating high fidelity strong lens
models includes careful consideration of uncertainties in the output models
that result from varying model parameters within the bounds of available data
constraints. It is not, however, common practice to account for the effects of
cosmological parameter value uncertainties. The convention is to instead use a
single fiducial ""concordance cosmology"" and generate lens models assuming zero
uncertainty in cosmological parameter values. We find that the magnification
maps of the individual HFF clusters vary significantly when lens models are
computed using different cosmological parameter values taken from recent
literature constraints from space- and ground-based experiments. Specifically,
the magnification maps have average variances across the best fit models
computed using different cosmologies that are comparable in magnitude to - and
as much as 2.5 times larger than - the model fitting uncertainties in each best
fit model. We also find that estimates of the mass profiles of the cluster
cores themselves vary only slightly when different input cosmological
parameters are used. We conclude that cosmological parameter uncertainty is a
non-negligible source of uncertainty in lens model products for the HFF
clusters, and that it is important that current and future work which relies on
precision strong lensing models take care to account for this additional source
of uncertainty.

different levels of resolution in different subregions of the system. When
traveling from one region to the other, particles change their resolution on

efficiency gained in the coarse-grained region. In this respect the best
coarse-grained system to employ in the low resolution region would be the ideal
gas, making intermolecular force calculations in the coarse-grained subdomain
redundant. In this case, however, a smooth coupling is challenging due to the
high energetic imbalance between typical liquids and a system of
non-interacting particles. In the present work, we investigate this approach,
using as a test case the most biologically relevant fluid, water. We
demonstrate that a successful coupling of water to the ideal gas can be

theory is reviewed in an `author-centered' frame to limit its scope. Our
efforts, i.e., with Fran\c{c}ois Perrot, sought to apply density functional
theory (DFT) to SCCS calculations. DFT was then poised to become the major
computational scheme for condensed matter physics. The ion-sphere models of
Salpeter and others evolved into useful average-atom models for finite-$T$
Coulomb systems, as in Lieberman's Inferno code. We replaced these by
correlation-sphere models that exploit the description of matter via density
functionals linked to pair-distributions. These methods provided practical
computational means for studying strongly interacting electron-ion Coulomb
systems like warm-dense matter (WDM). The staples of SCCS are wide-ranged,
viz., equation of state, plasma spectroscopy, opacity (absorption, emission),
scattering, level shifts, transport properties, e.g., electrical and heat
conductivity, laser- and shock- created plasmas, their energy relaxation and
transient properties etc. These calculations need pseudopotentials and
exchange-correlation functionals applicable to finite-$T$ Coulomb systems that
may be used in ab initio codes, molecular dynamics, etc. The search for simpler
computational schemes has proceeded via proposals for orbital-free DFT,
statistical potentials, classical maps of quantum systems using classical
schemes like HNC to include strong coupling effects (CHNC). Laughlin's
classical plasma map for the fractional quantum Hall effect (FQHE) is a seminal
example where we report new results for graphene.

applies Fourier analysis to provide the first rigorous description of the data

interpreted as specific spatial Fourier components of the incoming photon flux,

sensitive to the centrality of the collision. Centrality classes are defined
using different event activity estimators, i.e. charged particle multiplicities
measured in three disjunct pseudorapidity regions as well as the energy
measured at beam rapidity (zero-degree). The procedures to determine the
centrality, quantified by the number of participants ($N_{\rm part}$), or the
number of nucleon-nucleon binary collisions ($N_{\rm coll}$), are described. We
show that, in contrast to Pb-Pb collisions, in p-Pb collisions large
multiplicity fluctuations together with the small range of participants
available, generate a dynamical bias in centrality classes based on particle
multiplicity. We propose to use the zero-degree energy, which we expect not to
introduce a dynamical bias, as an alternative event-centrality estimator. Based
on zero-degree energy centrality classes, the $N_{\rm part}$ dependence of
particle production is studied. Under the assumption that the multiplicity
measured in the Pb-going rapidity region scales with the number of
Pb-participants, an approximate independence of the multiplicity per
participating nucleon measured at mid-rapitity of the number of participating
nucleons is observed. Furthermore, at high-$p_{\rm T}$ the p-Pb spectra are
found to be consistent with the pp spectra scaled by $N_{\rm coll}$ for all
centrality classes. Our results represent valuable input for the study of the
event activity dependence of hard probes in p-Pb collision and, hence, help to
establish baselines for the interpretation of the Pb-Pb data.

X-ray CT empirically performs comparable with an optimal compressed sensing
strategy, namely taking measurements with Gaussian sensing matrices. Second, we
show that, in contrast to what might have been anticipated, taking randomized
CT measurements does not lead to improved performance compared to standard

Standard Model. The theoretical interpretation of the corresponding observables
is limited by uncertainties from doubly Cabibbo-suppressed penguin topologies.
With continuously increasing experimental precision, it is mandatory to get a
handle on these contributions, which cannot be calculated reliably in QCD. In
the case of the measurement of $\sin2\beta$ from $B^0_d\to J/\psi K_{\rm S}^0$,
the $U$-spin-related decay $B^0_s\to J/\psi K_{\rm S}^0$ offers a tool to

the CP asymmetries of $B^0_s\to J/\psi K_{\rm S}^0$ and present a scenario to

derive bounds that restrict how this $H^1$-energy can be distributed inside

Carleman- type inequalities for such nonlinear waves. These bound the

Nevertheless, there is no unified approach that relates these elements to the

related by equations and algorithms to the discrete-time samples of sounds, and
each of these relations are implemented in scripts within a software toolbox,
referred to as MASS (Music and Audio in Sample Sequences). The fundamental
element, the musical note with duration, volume, pitch and timbre, is related
quantitatively to characteristics of the digital signal. Internal variations of
a note, such as tremolos, vibratos and spectral fluctuations, are also
considered, which enables the synthesis of notes inspired by real instruments
and new sonorities. With this representation of notes, resources are provided
for the generation of higher scale musical structures, such as rhythmic meter,
pitch intervals and cycles. This framework enables precise and trustful
scientific experiments, data sonification and is useful for education and art.
The efficacy of MASS is confirmed by the synthesis of small musical pieces
using basic notes, elaborated notes and notes in music, which reflects the
organization of the toolbox and thus of this article. It is possible to
synthesize whole albums through collage of the scripts and settings specified
by the user. With the open source paradigm, the toolbox can be promptly
scrutinized, expanded in co-authorship processes and used with freedom by
musicians, engineers and other interested parties. In fact, MASS has already
been employed for diverse purposes which include music production, artistic
presentations, psychoacoustic experiments and computer language diffusion where
the appeal of audiovisual artifacts is exploited for education.

both of the two functions (resp. their conjugates) are partly smooth relative
to their respective manifolds, we show that DR (resp. ADMM) identifies these
manifolds in finite time. Moreover, when these manifolds are affine or linear,
we prove that DR/ADMM is locally linearly convergent. When $J$ and $G$ are
locally polyhedral, we show that the optimal convergence radius is given in
terms of the cosine of the Friedrichs angle between the tangent spaces of the
identified manifolds. This is illustrated by several concrete examples and

cluster galaxies (BCGs) are excluded. The absolute magnitudes of BCGs follow a
Gaussian function with a characteristic width of about 0.36 mag. We find that
the luminosity function of galaxies in more relaxed clusters has a fainter
characteristic absolute magnitude (M_{\ast}), and these clusters have fewer
bright non-BCG member galaxies but a brighter BCG. Our results suggest the
co-evolution of galaxy population with cluster dynamical state and somewhat
support the hierarchical formation scenario of the BCGs.

are determined from the ro-vibrational lines of H2O. Although H2O lines in M
dwarfs are badly blended each other and the continuum levels are depressed
appreciably by the collective effect of numerous H2O lines themselves,
quantitative analysis of H2O lines has been carried out by referring to the
pseudo-continua both on the observed and theoretical spectra. For this purpose,
the pseudo-continuum on the theoretical spectrum has been evaluated by the use
of the recent high-precision H2O line-list. Then, we propose a simple and
flexible method of analyzing equivalent widths (EWs) of blended features by the
use of a mini curve-of-growth (CG), which is a small portion of the usual CG
around the observed EW. The mini CG is generated by using the theoretical EWs
evaluated from the synthetic spectrum by exactly the same way as the EWs are
measured from the observed spectrum. The observed EW is converted to the
abundance by the use of the mini CG, and the process is repeated for all the
observed EWs line-by-line or blend-by-blend. In cool M dwarfs, almost all the
oxygen atoms left after CO formation are in stable H2O molecules, which suffer
little change for the uncertainties due to imperfect modelling of the
photospheres. Then the numerous H2O lines are excellent abundance indicators of
oxygen. The oxygen abundances are determined to be logAo between -3.5 and -3.0
in 38 M dwarfs. The resulting O/C ratios plotted against logAc appear to be
systematically smaller in the carbon-rich M dwarfs, showing the different
formation histories of oxygen and carbon in the chemical evolution of the
Galactic disk. Also, O/Fe ratios in most M dwarfs are closer to the solar O/Fe
ratio based on the classical high oxygen abundance rather than on the recently
downward revised low value.

creates a large number of identities and uses them to control a substantial
fraction of the system. Persea is the most recent approach towards designing a
social network based Sybil-resistant DHT. Unlike prior Sybil-resistant P2P
systems based on social networks, Persea does not rely on two key assumptions:
(i) that the social network is fast mixing, and (ii) that there is a small
ratio of attack edges to honest peers. Both assumptions have been shown to be
unreliable in real social networks. The hierarchical distribution of node IDs
in Persea confines a large attacker botnet to a considerably smaller region of
the ID space than in a normal P2P system and its replication mechanism lets a
peer to retrieve the desired results even if a given region is occupied by
attackers. However, Persea system suffers from certain limitations, since it
cannot handle the scenario, where the malicious target returns an incorrect
result instead of just ignoring the lookup request. In this paper, we address
this major limitation of Persea through a Sybil detection mechanism built on
top of Persea system, which accommodates inspection lookup, a specially
designed lookup scheme to detect the Sybil nodes based on their responses to
the lookup query. We design a scheme to filter those detected Sybils to ensure
the participation of honest nodes on the lookup path during regular DHT lookup.
Since the malicious nodes are opt-out from the lookup path in our system, they
cannot return any incorrect result during regular lookup. We evaluate our
system in simulations with social network datasets and the results show that
catster, the largest network in our simulation with 149700 nodes and 5449275
edges, gains 100% lookup success rate, even when the number of attack edges is
equal to the number of benign peers in the network.

continuous-time quantum walk is a limit of the discrete-time quantum walk

lazy quantum walks. Our analysis shows that lazy quantum walks have $O(t^n)$
order of the n-th moment of the corresponding probability distribution, which
is the same as that for normal quantum walks. Also, the lazy quantum walk with
DFT (Discrete Fourier Transform) coin operator has a similar probability
distribution concentrated interval to that of the normal Hadamard quantum walk.
Most importantly, we introduce the concepts of occupancy number and occupancy
rate to measure the extent to which the walk has a (relatively) high
probability at every position in its range. We conclude that lazy quantum walks
have a higher occupancy rate than other walks such as normal quantum walks,
classical walks and lazy classical walks.

tunneling process at the event horizon of the black hole. In the quantum field
theoretic approach the Schwinger's mechanism is generally used to give an
explanation of this tunneling process. It is the decay of quantum vacuum into
particle anti-particle pairs near the black hole surface. However, in a
reference frame undergoing an uniform accelerated motion in an otherwise flat
Minkowski space-time geometry, in the non-relativistic approximation, the
particle production near the event horizon of a black hole may be treated as a
kind of Fowler-Nordheim field emission, which is the typical electron emission
process from a metal surface under the action of an external electrostatic
field. This type of emission from metal surface is allowed even at extremely
low temperature. It has been noticed that in one-dimensional scenario, the
Schr$\ddot{\rm{o}}$dinger equation satisfied by the created particle
(anti-particle) near the event horizon, can be reduced to a differential form
which is exactly identical with that obeyed by an electron immediately after
the emission from the metal surface under the action of a strong electrostatic
field. The mechanism of particle production near the event horizon of a black
hole is therefore identified with Schwinger process in relativistic quantum
field theory, whereas in the non-relativistic scenario it may be interpreted as
Fowler-Nordheim emission process, when observed from an uniformly accelerated
frame.

conventionally involves the absorption of energetic photon, thermalization and
the emission of a red-shifted photon. Conversely, in optical-refrigeration the
absorption of low energy photon is followed by endothermic-PL of energetic
photon. Both aspects were mainly studied where thermal population is far weaker
than photonic excitation, obscuring the generalization of PL and thermal
emissions. Here we experimentally study endothermic-PL at high temperatures. In
accordance with theory, we show how PL photon rate is conserved with
temperature increase, while each photon is blue shifted. Further rise in
temperature leads to an abrupt transition to thermal emission where the photon
rate increases sharply. We also show how endothermic-PL generates orders of
magnitude more energetic photons than thermal emission at similar temperatures.
Relying on these observations, we propose and theoretically study thermally
enhanced PL (TEPL) for highly efficient solar-energy conversion, with
thermodynamic efficiency limit of 70%.

spin magnetic moment localized at the Ni atoms induces a significant spin
polarization in the organic molecule; the corresponding spin density being
delocalized along the whole system. The exchange interaction between localized
spins at Ni centers and the itinerant spin density is ferromagnetic. Based on
two different model Hamiltonians, we estimate the strength of exchange
couplings between magnetic atoms for both Ni- and Mn-TCNQ networks that results
in weak ferromagnetic and very weak antiferromagnetic correlations for Ni- and
Mn-TCNQ networks, respectively.

lower than those of a one dimensional lattice. Herein, we study the
Bose-Hubbard model, which has an additional trimer tunneling term, a three-body
interaction and a next-nearest repulsion. The on-site trimer and trimer
superfluid exist if the on-site two-body repulsion and three-body repulsion are
smaller than some thresholds. With atom-tunneling terms, the phase transitions
from trimer superfluid phase to both atom superfluid and atom supersolid phases
are first order. With $W/J=12$, in a one dimensional lattice, the trimer
superfluid phase does not exist at all. In contrast, the trimer superfluid
phase, exists in the lower density regions $0 \textless \rho \textless2$ on the
square lattice if $J$ is not very large. The trimer superfluid phase emerges in
a wider range $0 \textless \rho \textless3$ in the triangular lattice, or in
the cubic lattice ($z=6$). When the three-body interaction is turned on, a
trimer supersolid phase emerges due to the classical degeneracy between the
quasi trimer solid and the trimer solid being broken by the quantum
fluctuation. The phase transitions from the trimer supersolid phase to quasi
trimer solid are first order and the phase transition from the trimer
supersolid phase to trimer solid is continuous. Our results, obtained by
mean-field and quantum Monte Carlo methods, will be helpful in realizing the
trimer superfluid and supersolid by cold atom experiments.

Relativity, we trace the historical development since its verification at a
solar eclipse in 1919. Einstein was apparently cautious about its practical
utility and the subject lay dormant observationally for nearly 60 years.
Nonetheless there has been rapid progress over the past twenty years. The
technique allows astronomers to chart the distribution of dark matter on large
and small scales thereby testing predictions of the standard cosmological model
which assumes dark matter comprises a massive weakly-interacting particle. By
measuring distances and tracing the growth of dark matter structure over cosmic
time, gravitational lensing also holds great promise in determining whether the
dark energy, postulated to explain the accelerated cosmic expansion, is a
vacuum energy density or a failure of General Relativity on large scales. We
illustrate the wide range of applications which harness the power of
gravitational lensing, from searches for the earliest galaxies magnified by
massive clusters to those for extrasolar planets which temporarily brighten a
background star. We summarise the future prospects with dedicated ground and
space-based facilities designed to exploit this remarkable physical phenomenon.

We investigate the effects of ionising photons on accretion and stellar

transfer code coupled to a smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) simulation.
Methods. We introduce the framework with which we correct stellar cluster
masses for the effects of photoionising (PI) feedback and compare to the
results of a full ionisation hydrodynamics code. Results. We present results of
our simulations of star formation in the spiral arm of a disk galaxy, including
the effects of photoionising radiation from high mass stars. We find that PI
feedback reduces the total mass accreted onto stellar clusters by approximately
23 per cent over the course of the simulation and reduces the number of high
mass clusters, as well as the maximum mass attained by a stellar cluster. Mean
star formation rates (SFRs) drop from 0.042 solar masses per year in our
control run to 0.032 solar masses per year after the inclusion of PI feedback
with a final instantaneous SFR reduction of 62 per cent. The overall cluster
mass distribution appears to be affected little by PI feedback. Conclusions. We
compare our results to the observed extra-galactic Schmidt-Kennicutt relation
and the observed properties of local star forming regions in the Milky Way and
find that internal photoionising (PI) feedback is unlikely to reduce star
formation rates by more than a factor of approximately 2 and thus may play only
a minor role in regulating star formation.

We report and compare our numerical growth rates with the classic analytical
solutions of Zener and Frank (ZF). The numerical results deviate from the
analytical ones. These deviations can be understood in terms of the generalised
Gibbs-Thomson effect. Specifically, due to the higher capillary contribution in
3-D (curvature is twice for a sphere compared to a circle), the precipitate
growth kinetics deviates more from ZF in 3-D as compared to 2-D. In addition,
the kinetic parameter associated with the normal velocity of the
precipitate-matrix interface also modifies the deviation of the precipitate
composition from its equilibrium value and hence its growth kinetics. In phase
field models (such as the one used by us) which use a combination of Allen-Cahn
and Cahn-Hilliard type equations, we show how to choose the kinetic parameters
(namely, mobility and relaxation parameter) so that the kinetic coefficient (in
the generalised Gibbs-Thomson equation) is made effectively zero. We also show
that the kinetic parameter the precipitate-matrix interface might play a
crucial role in making the precipitate undergo morphological instabilities as

non-BAL objects is possibly caused by the absorption of X-ray emission by the
shielding material near the equatorial plane. On the other hand, the radio-loud
BALQSOs are more X-ray loud than the radio-quiet ones. This suggests that part
of the X-ray emission may arise from the radio jet. To investigate this
possibility, we modelled the nuclear spectra of two radio-loud BALQSOs. We
focus on the emission from the very centres of these two objects. The source of
emission was approximated by a single, homogeneous component that produces
synchrotron and inverse-Compton (IC) radiation. The simplicity of the model
allowed us to estimate the basic physical parameters of the emitting regions,
using a universal analytic approach. Such methods have already been used in
blazars. For the first time we propose this solution for quasars. In addition,
we modelled the radiation spectra of the accretion disk and its corona to
compare them with the jets' spectra. We find that in the case of luminous
3C270.1, the nuclear X-ray continuum is dominated by the non-thermal, IC
emission from the innermost parts of the radio jet. However, the radio core of
the lobe-dominated PG 1004+130 is probably too weak to produce significant part
of the observed X-ray emission. A large contribution from the X-ray emitting
accretion disk and corona is produced in our model. However, it then exceeds
the observed flux. Because the large intrinsic absorption was postulated
recently by the NuSTAR observations, we propose that the disk-corona component
may still account for the X-rays produced in this source. This part of the
spectrum must nevertheless be dominated by the X-ray jet. We conclude that the
jet-linked X-ray emission is present in strong and weak radio sources, but its
fraction seems to scale with the radio jet power.

scalar-to-tensor ratio via a spiralling trajectory in the field space of a
complex field $\Phi$. Here we consider how the predictions of the model are
modified by Planck scale-suppressed corrections. In the absence of Planck
corrections the model is equivalent to a $\phi^{4/3}$ chaotic inflation model.
Planck corrections become important when the dimensionless coupling $\xi$ of
$|\Phi|^{2}$ to the topological charge density of the strongly-coupled gauge
sector $F \tilde{F}$ satisfies $\xi \sim 1$. For values of $|\Phi|$ which allow
the Planck corrections to be understood via an expansion in powers of
$|\Phi|^{2}/M_{Pl}^{2}$, we show that their effect is to produce a significant
modification of the tensor-to-scalar ratio from its $\phi^{4/3}$ chaotic
inflation value without strongly modifying the spectral index. In addition, to
leading order in $|\Phi|^2/M_{Pl}^{2}$, the Planck modifications of $n_{s}$ and
$r$ satisfy a consistency relation, $\Delta n_{s} = - \Delta r/16$. Observation
of these modifications and their correlation would allow the model to be
distinguished from a simple $\phi^{4/3}$ chaotic inflation model and would also
provide a signature for the influence of leading-order Planck corrections.

magnetic ions on two inequivalent sites (3- and 4-co-ordinated ones),
represents a fascinating example for studying geometric frustration effects in
two-dimensions. In this work, we investigate the spin $S$ = $1/2$ Cairo
pentagonal lattice with respect to selective exchange coupling (which
effectively corresponds to a virtual doping of $x$ = $0, 1/6, 1/3$), in a
nearest-neighbour antiferromagnetic Ising model. We also develop a simple
method to quantify geometric frustration in terms of a frustration index
$\phi(\beta,T)$, where $\beta$ = $J/\tilde{J}$, the ratio of the two exchange
couplings required by the symmetry of the Cairo lattice. At $T = 0$, the
undoped Cairo pentagonal lattice shows antiferromagnetic ordering for $\beta
\le \beta_{crit} = 2$, but undergoes a first-order transition to a
ferrimagnetic phase for $\beta >$ $\beta_{crit}$. The results show that
$\phi(\beta,T = 0)$ tracks the transition in the form of a cusp maximum at
$\beta_{crit}$.
  While both phases show frustration, the obtained magnetic structures reveal
that the frustration originates in different bonds for the two phases. The
frustration and ferrimagnetic order get quenched by selective exchange
coupling, and lead to robust antiferromagnetic ordering for $x$ = 1/6 and 1/3.
From mean-field calculations, we determine the temperature-dependent
sub-lattice magnetizations for $x$ = $0, 1/6$ and $1/3$. The calculated results
are discussed in relation to known experimental results for trivalent
Bi$_2$Fe$_4$O$_9$ and mixed valent BiFe$_2$O$_{4.63}$. The study identifies the
role of frustration effects, the ratio $\beta$ and selective exchange coupling
for stabilizing ferrimagnetic versus anti-ferromagnetic order in the Cairo
pentagonal lattice.

a specific comparison method. In this paper we apply a wide range of removal
strategies and comparison methods in order to study the sensitivity of
medium-sized networks from real world and randomly generated networks. In the

are not. This effect is conclusive with the work of Boldi et al. who analyzed
very large networks. For similarly generated random graphs we find that the
sensitivity highly depends on the comparison method. The choice of the removal
strategy has surprisingly marginal impact on the sensitivity as long as we

unphysical in that they induce inconsistencies due to violating the principle
of causality. In addition, they must get broken in order to be consistent with
all physical constraints naturally arising in the statistical
Lundgren-Monin-Novikov (LMN) description of turbulence. As a result, we state
that besides the well-known classical symmetries of the LMN equations no new
statistical symmetries exist. Yet, aside from this particular issue, the
article by Waclawczyk et al. (2014) is flawed in more than one respect, ranging
from an incomplete proof, to a self-contradicting statement up to an incorrect

convergence. Often, the control laws are designed so that two neighboring
agents repel/attract each other at a short/long distance of separation. When
the interactions between neighboring agents are moreover nonfading, the
potential function from which they are derived is radially unbounded. Hence,
the LaSalle's principle is sufficient to establish the system convergence. This
paper investigates, in contrast, a more realistic scenario where interactions
between neighboring agents have fading attractions. In such setting, the
LaSalle type arguments may not be sufficient. To tackle the problem, we
introduce a class of partitions, termed dilute partitions, of formations which
cluster agents according to the inter- and intra-cluster interaction strengths.
We then apply dilute partitions to trajectories of formations generated by the
multi-agent system, and show that each of the trajectories remains bounded
along the evolution, and converges to the set of equilibria.

differential equations (ODEs) are often a natural model for biological
processes. However such models are difficult to analyze. To address this, we
develop a probabilistic analysis method by approximating the mode transitions
as stochastic events. We assume that the probability of making a mode
transition is proportional to the measure of the set of pairs of time points
and value states at which the mode transition is enabled. To ensure a sound
mathematical basis, we impose a natural continuity property on the non-linear
ODEs. We also assume that the states of the system are observed at discrete
time points but that the mode transitions may take place at any time between
two successive discrete time points. This leads to a discrete time Markov chain
as a probabilistic approximation of the hybrid system. We then show that for
BLTL (bounded linear time temporal logic) specifications the hybrid system
meets a specification iff its Markov chain approximation meets the same
specification with probability $1$. Based on this, we formulate a sequential
hypothesis testing procedure for verifying -approximately- that the Markov
chain meets a BLTL specification with high probability. Our case studies on
cardiac cell dynamics and the circadian rhythm indicate that our scheme can be
applied in a number of realistic settings.

these relics provide us a unique window on the early universe. Currently, BBN
simulations give acceptable agreement between theoretical and observed

predicted $^7$Li abundance with the observation for the Galactic halo stars.
The BBN model overestimates the primordial $^7$Li abundance by about a factor
of three, so called the cosmological lithium problem, a long-lasting pending
issue in BBN. Great efforts have been paid in the past decades, however, the
conventional nuclear physics seems unable to resolve such problem. It is
well-known that the classical Maxwell-Boltzmann (MB) velocity distribution has
been usually assumed for nuclei in the Big-Bang plasma. In this work, we have
thoroughly investigated the impact of non-extensive Tsallis statistics
(deviating from the MB) on thermonuclear reaction rates involved in standard
models of BBN. It shows that the predicted primordial abundances of D, $^4$He,
and $^7$Li agree very well with those observed ones by introducing a
non-extensive parameter $q$. It is discovered that the velocities of nuclei in
a hot Big-Bang plasma indeed violate the classical Maxwell-Boltzmann (MB)
distribution in a very small deviation of about 6.3--8.2%. Thus, we have for
the first time found a new solution to the cosmological lithium problem without
introducing any mysterious theories. Furthermore, the implications of
non-extensive statistics in other exotic high-temperature and density
astrophysical environments should be explored, which might offer new insight
into the nucleosynthesis of heavy elements.

background. When he was a student at the ETH in Z\""urich (the Swiss Federal
Polytechnic in Z\""urich) from 1896 to 1900, he would make regular trips back to
Milan to stay with his family who was involved in the development of the
electricity industry in northern Italy. Between 1899 and 1901, he would meet
his faithful friend and collaborator, Michele Besso in Milan on a regular
basis. Given their relationship, the 1899-1901 Milanese period therefore
foreshadowed the Bern period later in 1904. In order to specify the
circumstances under which Einstein and Besso got the chance to meet, we will
show that their respective families did have interconnected social networks,
especially through the electricity sector and the polytechnic engineering
Universities of Z\""urich and Milan. The branch of the Cantoni family, on
Michele's mother's side, rather ignored by now, played a crucial role: with
Vittorio Cantoni, a renowned electrical engineer who had not been previously
identified as being Michele's uncle, and Giuseppe Jung, professor at the Milan
Politecnico. We will also show that when staying in Milan, Einstein, who lived
in a well-known Milanese palace in the heart of the city, worked in the nearby
rich library of the Istituto Lombardo, Accademia di Scienze e Lettere in Brera.
The linkage between the scientific observations which can be found in
Einstein's correspondence and this library collection sheds new light on his
scientific work, in particular on his original thesis.

graphs. If G the boundary of a three dimensional graph H for example, we can
refine the interior until it is colourable with 4 colours. The later goal is
achieved if all interior edge degrees are even. Using a refinement process
which cuts the interior along surfaces we can adapt the degrees along the
boundary of that surface. More efficient is a self-cobordism of G with itself
with a host graph discretizing the product of G with an interval. It follows
from the fact that Euler curvature is zero everywhere for three dimensional
geometric graphs, that the odd degree edge set O is a cycle and so a boundary
if H is simply connected. A reduction to minimal colouring would imply the four
colour theorem. The method is expected to give a reason ""why 4 colours suffice""
and suggests that every two dimensional geometric graph of arbitrary degree and
orientation can be coloured by 5 colours: since the projective plane can not be
a boundary of a 3-dimensional graph and because for higher genus surfaces, the
interior H is not simply connected, we need in general to embed a surface into
a 4-dimensional simply connected graph in order to colour it. This explains the
appearance of the chromatic number 5 for higher degree or non-orientable
situations, a number we believe to be the upper limit. For every surface type,
we construct examples with chromatic number 3,4 or 5, where the construction of
surfaces with chromatic number 5 is based on a method of Fisk. We have
implemented and illustrated all the topological aspects described in this paper
on a computer. So far we still need human guidance or simulated annealing to do
the refinements in the higher dimensional host graph.

Euclid to Lobachevsky and from Kolmogorov to Bell. In probability Bell played
the same role as Lobachevsky in geometry. In fact, violation of Bell's
inequality implies the impossibility to apply the classical probability model
of Kolmogorov (1933) to quantum phenomena. Thus quantum probabilistic model
(based on Born's rule) is an example of non-Kolmogorovian model of probability,
similarly to the Lobachevskian model -- the first example of non-Euclidean
model of geometry. We also discuss coupling of the classical probabilistic
model with classical (Boolean) logic. The Kolmogorov model of probability is
based on the set-theoretic presentation of the Boolean logic. In this framework
violation of Bell's inequality implies the impossibility to use the Boolean
structure of events for quantum phenomena; instead of it, events have to be
represented by linear subspaces. This is the ""probability model"" interpretation
of violation of Bell's inequality. We also criticize the standard
interpretation -- an attempt to add to rigorous mathematical probability models
additional elements such as (non)locality and (un)realism. Finally, we compare

study of their orbital parameters and system architectures. Because most
directly-imaged planets have long orbital periods (>20 AU), accurate astrometry
is challenging when based on data acquired on timescales of a few years and
usually with different instruments. The LMIRCam camera on the LBT is being used
for the LEECH survey to search for and characterize young and adolescent
exoplanets in L' band, including their system architectures. Aims. We first aim
to provide a good astrometric calibration of LMIRCam. Then, we derive new
astrometry, test the predictions of the orbital model of 8:4:2:1 mean motion
resonance proposed by Go\'zdziewski & Migaszewski, and perform new orbital
fitting of the HR 8799 bcde planets. We also present deep limits on a putative
fifth planet interior to the known planets. Methods. We use observations of HR
8799 and the Theta1 Ori C field obtained during the same run in October 2013.
Results. We first characterize the distortion of LMIRCam. We determine a
platescale and a true north orientation for the images of 10.707 +/- 0.012
mas/pix and -0.430 +/- 0.076 deg, respectively. The errors on the platescale
and true north orientation translate into astrometric accuracies at a
separation of 1 of 1.1 mas and 1.3 mas, respectively. The measurements for all
planets are usually in agreement within 3 sigma with the ephemeris predicted by
Go\'zdziewski & Migaszewski. The orbital fitting based on the new astrometric
measurements favors an architecture for the planetary system based on 8:4:2:1
mean motion resonance. The detection limits allow us to exclude a fifth planet
slightly brighter/more massive than HR 8799 b at the location of the 2:1
resonance with HR 8799 e (~9.5 AU) and about twice as bright as HR 8799 cde at
the location of the 3:1 resonance with HR 8799 e (~7.5 AU).

studying astrophysical processes involving light nuclei. Generally higher
temperatures and nuclear level densities lead to stronger contributions of
transitions on excited target states. This may prevent cross section
measurements to determine stellar reaction rates and theory contributions
remain important. Furthermore, measurements often are not feasible in the
astrophysically relevant energy range. Sensitivity analysis allows not only to
determine the contributing nuclear properties but also is a handy tool for
experimentalists to interpret the impact of their data on predicted cross
sections and rates. It can also speed up future input variation studies of
nucleosynthesis by simplifying an intermediate step in the full calculation
sequence. Large-scale predictions of sensitivities and ground-state
contributions to the stellar rates are presented, allowing an estimate of how
well rates can be directly constrained by experiment. The reactions
185W(n,gamma) and 186W(gamma,n) are discussed as application examples. Studies
of uncertainties in abundances predicted in nucleosynthesis simulations rely on
the knowledge of reaction rate errors. An improved treatment of uncertainty
analysis is presented as well as a recipe for combining experimental data and
theory to arrive at a new reaction rate and its uncertainty. As an example, it
is applied to neutron capture rates for the s-process, leading to larger
uncertainties than previously assumed.

two right-handed neutrinos are dominantly responsible for the ""atmospheric"" and
""solar"" neutrino masses with Yukawa couplings to $(\nu_e, \nu_{\mu},
\nu_{\tau})$ proportional to $(0,1,1)$ and $(1,n,n-2)$, respectively, where $n$
is a positive integer. These coupling patterns may arise in indirect family
symmetry models based on $A_4$. With two right-handed neutrinos, using a
$\chi^2$ test, we find a good agreement with data for CSD(3) and CSD(4) where
the entire PMNS mixing matrix is controlled by a single phase $\eta$, which
takes simple values, leading to accurate predictions for mixing angles and the
magnitude of the oscillation phase $|\delta_{CP}|$. We carefully study the
perturbing effect of a third ""decoupled"" right-handed neutrino, leading to a
bound on the lightest physical neutrino mass $m_1 \lesssim 1$ meV for the
viable cases, corresponding to a normal neutrino mass hierarchy. We also
discuss a direct link between the oscillation phase $\delta_{CP} $ and
leptogenesis in CSD($n$) due to the same see-saw phase $\eta$ appearing in both
the neutrino mass matrix and leptogenesis.

strong evidence of interaction between the forward shock and a molecular cloud.
It has been studied in detail from radio frequencies to high-energy (HE,
0.1-100 GeV) gamma-rays. An analysis of the Fermi-LAT data has shown an
extended HE gamma-ray emission with a 0.2-100 GeV spectrum exhibiting no
significant deviation from a power law, unlike most of the GeV-emitting SNRs
known to be interacting with molecular clouds. This makes it a promising target
for imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes (IACTs) to probe the gamma-ray
emission above 100 GeV. Very-high-energy (VHE, E >= 0.1 TeV) gamma-ray emission
from Puppis A is for the first time searched for with the High Energy
Stereoscopic System (H.E.S.S.). The analysis of the H.E.S.S. data does not
reveal any significant emission towards Puppis A. The derived upper limits on
the differential photon flux imply that its broadband gamma-ray spectrum must
exhibit a spectral break or cutoff. By combining Fermi-LAT and H.E.S.S.
measurements, the 99% confidence level upper limits on such a cutoff are found
to be 450 and 280 GeV, assuming a power law with a simple exponential and a
sub-exponential cutoff, respectively. It is concluded that none of the standard
limitations (age, size, radiative losses) on the particle acceleration
mechanism, assumed to be still on-going at present, can explain the lack of VHE
signal. The scenario in which particle acceleration has ceased some time ago is
considered as an alternative explanation. The HE/VHE spectrum of Puppis A could
then exhibit a break of non-radiative origin, (as observed in several other
interacting SNRs, albeit at somewhat higher energies) owing to the interaction
with dense and neutral material in particular towards the northeastern region.

considered. In both cases we identify the large `central charge', find a
separation of scales between the radius of AdS and the size of the extra
dimensions and show that the dual CFT has only a limited number of operators
with small conformal dimension. Differences between the two sets of duals are
identified. Besides a different amount of supersymmetry ($\mathcal{N}=1$ for
KKLT and $\mathcal{N}=0$ for LVS) we find that the LVS CFT dual has only one
scalar operator with $\mathcal{O}(1)$ conformal dimension, corresponding to the
volume modulus, whereas in KKLT the whole set of $h^{1,1}$ K\""ahler moduli have
this property. Also, the maximal number of degrees of freedom is estimated to
be larger in LVS than in KKLT duals. In both cases we explicitly compute the
coefficient of the logarithmic contribution to the one-loop vacuum energy which
should be invariant under duality and therefore provides a non-trivial
prediction for the dual CFT. This coefficient takes a particularly simple form
in the KKLT case.

scene from the point of view of the observer are an important prerequisite for
many vision and mobile robot tasks. Although they can be extracted from range
data however extracting them from images and videos would be extremely
beneficial. We trained a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) to identify

CNN avoids hand-crafting of features for automatically isolating occlusion

  Second-Order Diffusion","Full version of paper submitted to ICDCS 2015",,,,"cs.DC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper we consider a wide class of discrete diffusion load balancing
algorithms. The problem is defined as follows. We are given an interconnection
network and a number of load items, which are arbitrarily distributed among the
nodes of the network. The goal is to redistribute the load in iterative
discrete steps such that at the end each node has (almost) the same number of
items. In diffusion load balancing nodes are only allowed to balance their load
with their direct neighbors.
  We show three main results. Firstly, we present a general framework for
randomly rounding the flow generated by continuous diffusion schemes over the
edges of a graph in order to obtain corresponding discrete schemes. Compared to
the results of Rabani, Sinclair, and Wanka, FOCS'98, which are only valid
w.r.t. the class of homogeneous first order schemes, our framework can be used
to analyze a larger class of diffusion algorithms, such as algorithms for
heterogeneous networks and second order schemes. Secondly, we bound the
deviation between randomized second order schemes and their continuous
counterparts. Finally, we provide a bound for the minimum initial load in a
network that is sufficient to prevent the occurrence of negative load at a node
during the execution of second order diffusion schemes.
  Our theoretical results are complemented with extensive simulations on
different graph classes. We show empirically that second order schemes, which
are usually much faster than first order schemes, will not balance the load
completely on a number of networks within reasonable time. However, the maximum
load difference at the end seems to be bounded by a constant value, which can
be further decreased if first order scheme is applied once this value is
achieved by second order scheme.

consists of a pyramid of wavelet scattering operators, which generalizes

  Binary Fluid Mixtures","11 pages, 2 figures",,"10.1103/PhysRevE.91.042402",,"cond-mat.soft","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We consider the thermal undulation, or shape fluctuation, of an almost planar
fluid membrane surrounded by the same near-critical binary fluid mixtures on
both sides. A weak preferential attraction is assumed between the membrane and
one component of the mixture. We use the Gaussian free-energy functional to
study the equilibrium average of the undulation amplitude within the linear
approximation with respect to the amplitude. According to our result given by a
simple analytic formula, the ambient near-criticality tends to suppress the
undulation of a membrane, and this suppression effect can overwhelm that of the
bending rigidity for small wave numbers. Thus, the ambient near-criticality is
suggested to prevent a large membrane from becoming floppy even if the lateral
tension vanishes at the equilibrium.

a graph. We provide strong analytical and empirical evidence that the average
communicability angle for a given network accounts for its spatial efficiency
on the basis of the communications among the nodes in a network. We determine
characteristics of the spatial efficiency of more than a hundred real-world
complex networks that represent complex systems arising in a diverse set of
scenarios. In particular, we find that the communicability angle correlates
very well with the experimentally measured value of the relative packing
efficiency of proteins that are represented as residue networks. We finally
show how we can modulate the spatial efficiency of a network by tuning the
weights of the edges of the networks. This allows us to predict effects of
external stresses on the spatial efficiency of a network as well as to design
strategies to improve important parameters in real-world complex systems.

near-critical binary mixture when the fluid far from the particles is outside
the coexistence (CX) curve and is rich in the component disfavored by the
colloid surfaces. In such situations, the adsorption-induced interaction is
enhanced, leading to bridging and aggregation of the particles. We realize
bridging firstly by changing the temperature with a fixed interparticle
separation and secondly by letting the two particles aggregate. The
interparticle attractive force dramatically increases upon bridging. The
dynamics is governed by hydrodynamic flow around the colloid surfaces. In
aggregation, the adsorption layers move with the particles and squeezing occurs
at narrow separation. We take into account the renormalization effect due to
the critical fluctuations using the recent local functional theory [J. Chem.
Phys. 136, 114704 (2012)].

nanoscale distances yields a variety of charge-induced changes in the
structural features of the confined film. That includes even-odd switching of
the structural layering and charging-induced solidification and melting, with
important changes of local ordering between and within layers, and of squeezout
behavior. By means of molecular dynamics simulations, we explore this variety
of phenomena in the simplest charged Lennard-Jones coarse-grained model
including or excluding the effect a neutral tail giving an anisotropic shape to
one of the model ions. Using these models and open conditions permitting the
flow of ions in and out of the interplate gap, we simulate the liquid squeezout
to obtain the distance dependent structure and forces between the plates during
their adiabatic appraoch under load. Simulations at fixed applied force
illustrate an effective electrical pumping of the ionic liquid, from a thick
nearly solid film that withstands the interplate pressure for high plate charge
to complete squeezout following melting near zero charge. Effective enthalpy
curves obtained by integration of interplate forces versus distance show the
local minima that correspond to layering, and predict the switching between one
minimum and another under squeezing and charging.

Seebeck effect (SSE) of the bilayer system yttrium iron garnet (YIG) - platinum

treatment of the YIG single crystal surface. We observe that the saturation
magnetic field H_{sat} for the SSE signal increases from 55.3 mT to 72.8 mT
with mechanical treatment. The change in the magnitude of H_{sat} can be
attributed to the presence of a perpendicular magnetic anisotropy due to the
treatment induced surface strain or shape anisotropy in the Pt/YIG system. Our
results show that the SSE is a powerful tool to investigate magnetic anisotropy
at the interface.

superconducting loop in an externally produced magnetic field is not taken into
account in the theory of quantization effects because of identification of the
Hamiltonian with the energy. This identification misleads if, in accordance
with the conservation law, the energy of a state is the energy expended for its
creation. The energy of magnetic moment is deduced from a creation history of
the current state in magnetic field both in the classical and quantum case. But
taking this energy into account demolishes the agreement between theory and
experiment. Impartial consideration of this problem discovers the contradiction
both in theory and experiment.
