with spacelike extra dimension and with a scalar field source in the bulk. We
have studied the dynamics of the scalar field under different types of
potential in an effort to explain the confinement of particles in the
five-dimensional spacetime. The behavior of the system is determined from the
nature of damping force on the system. We have also examined the nature of the
effective potential under different circumstances. Lastly we have studied the
system to determine whether or not the system attains asymptotically stable
condition for both unperturbed and perturbed conditions. The analysis throws
significant light on the nature confinement of particles and the stability of
the dynamical system under these conditions.

be divided naturally into the subfamily of Willmore surfaces conformally
equivalent to a minimal surface in $\R^{n+2}$ and those which are not
conformally equivalent to a minimal surface in $\R^{n+2}$. On the level of
their conformal Gauss maps into
$Gr_{1,3}(\R^{1,n+3})=SO^+(1,n+3)/SO^+(1,3)\times SO(n)$ these two classes of
Willmore immersions into $S^{n+2}$ correspond to conformally harmonic maps for
which every image point, considered as a 4-dimensional Lorentzian subspace of
$\R^{1,n+3}$, contains a fixed lightlike vector or where it does not contain
such a ""constant lightlike vector"". Using the loop group formalism for the
construction of Willmore immersions we characterize in this paper precisely
those normalized potentials which correspond to conformally harmonic maps
containing a lightlike vector. Since the special form of these potentials can
easily be avoided, we also precisely characterize those potentials which
produce Willmore immersions into $ S^{n+2}$ which are not conformal to a
minimal surface in $\R^{n+2}$. It turns out that our proof also works
analogously for minimal immersions into the other space forms.

  July 2015, Guilin, Guangxi, China",,,,"cs.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The workflow satisfiability problem (WSP) asks whether there exists an
assignment of authorised users to the steps in a workflow specification,
subject to certain constraints on the assignment. (Such an assignment is called
valid.) The problem is NP-hard even when restricted to the large class of
user-independent constraints. Since the number of steps $k$ is relatively small
in practice, it is natural to consider a parametrisation of the WSP by $k$. We
propose a new fixed-parameter algorithm to solve the WSP with user-independent
constraints. The assignments in our method are partitioned into equivalence
classes such that the number of classes is exponential in $k$ only. We show
that one can decide, in polynomial time, whether there is a valid assignment in
an equivalence class. By exploiting this property, our algorithm reduces the
search space to the space of equivalence classes, which it browses within a
backtracking framework, hence emerging as an efficient yet relatively
simple-to-implement or generalise solution method. We empirically evaluate our
algorithm against the state-of-the-art methods and show that it clearly wins
the competition on the whole range of our test problems and significantly
extends the domain of practically solvable instances of the WSP.

the Standard Model fermions, we consider extended gauge dynamics, effectively
represented by four fermion interactions at presently accessible energies. By
systematically treating these interactions, we show that they lead to a large
reduction of the mass of the scalar resonance. Therefore, interpreting the
scalar as the recently observed 125 GeV state, implies that the mass
originating solely from new strong dynamics can be much heavier, {\em {\em

resonance, we show that the four-fermion interactions allow for contributions
to the oblique corrections in agreement with the experimental constraints. The
couplings of the scalar resonance with the Standard Model gauge bosons and

interconnected sites have massive local data and they are interested in
collaboratively learning a low-dimensional geometric structure underlying these
data. In contrast to previous works on subspace-based data representations,
this paper focuses on the geometric structure of a union of subspaces (UoS). In
this regard, it proposes a distributed algorithm---termed cloud K-SVD---for
collaborative learning of a UoS structure underlying distributed data of
interest. The goal of cloud K-SVD is to learn a common overcomplete dictionary
at each individual site such that every sample in the distributed data can be
represented through a small number of atoms of the learned dictionary. Cloud
K-SVD accomplishes this goal without requiring exchange of individual samples
between sites. This makes it suitable for applications where sharing of raw
data is discouraged due to either privacy concerns or large volumes of data.
This paper also provides an analysis of cloud K-SVD that gives insights into
its properties as well as deviations of the dictionaries learned at individual
sites from a centralized solution in terms of different measures of
local/global data and topology of interconnections. Finally, the paper
numerically illustrates the efficacy of cloud K-SVD on real and synthetic
distributed data.

governed by the standard (deterministic) replicator dynamics; in the presence
of noise however, the induced stochastic dynamics are different from previous
versions of the stochastic replicator dynamics (such as the aggregate-shocks

magnitude of the shocks; on the other hand, in the high-noise regime,
non-equilibrium states may also become stochastically asymptotically stable and
dominated strategies may survive in perpetuity (they become extinct if the
noise is low). Such behavior is eliminated if players are less myopic and
revise their strategies based on their cumulative payoffs. In this case, we
obtain a second order stochastic dynamical system whose attracting states
coincide with the game's strict equilibria and where dominated strategies
become extinct (a.s.), no matter the noise level.

propose a new method to enhance the Gabor wavelets process extracting a fractal

unitary composite-system operator that contains the relevant
object-measuring-instrument interaction brings about the final premeasurement
state. It does not include collapse, and it does not consider the environment.
It is assumed that a discrete degenerate or non-degenerate observable is
measured. Premeasurement is defined by the calibration condition, which
requires that every initially statistically sharp value of the measured
observable has to be detected with statistical certainty by the measuring
instrument. The entire theory is derived as a logical consequence of this
definition using the standard quantum formalism. The study has a comprehensive
coverage, hence the article is actually a topical review. Connection is made
with results of other authors, particularly with basic works on premeasurement.
The article is a conceptual review, not a historical one. General exact
premeasurement is defined in 7 equivalent ways. Nondemolition premeasurement,
defined by requiring preservation of any sharp value of the measured
observable, is characterized in 10 equivalent ways. Overmeasurement, i. e., a
process in which the observable is measured on account of being a function of a
finer observable that is actually measured, is discussed. Disentangled
premeasurement, in which, by definition, to each result corresponds only one
pointer-observable state in the final composite-system state, is investigated.
Ideal premeasurement, a special case of both nondemolition premeasurement and
disentangled premeasurement, is defined, and its most important properties are
discussed. Finally, disentangled and entangled premeasurements, in conjunction
with nondemolition or demolition premeasurements, are used for classification
of all premeasurements.

occultations of the strong radio source 3C 273 at Parkes, which led Maarten
Schmidt to identify 3C 273 with an apparent stellar object at a redshift of
0.16, was the true nature understood. Successive radio and optical measurements
quickly led to the identification of other quasars with increasingly large
redshifts and the general, although for some decades not universal, acceptance
of quasars as the very luminous nuclei of galaxies. Curiously, 3C 273, which is
one of the strongest extragalactic sources in the sky, was first cataloged in
1959 and the magnitude 13 optical counterpart was observed at least as early as

primarily at the Caltech Owens Valley Radio Observatory. However, 3C 273 eluded

previous studies, we obtained the time-averaged limit and stationary measures
concerning localization for the Wojcik model. As a result, we get the
mathematical expression of the whole picture of the behavior of the walker for
the Wojcik model. Here the coexistence of localization and the ballistic
spreading is one of the peculiar properties of one-dimensional QWs with one
defect. Due to the coexistence, it has been strongly expected to utilize QWs to
quantum search algorithms. In order to derive the weak convergence theorem, we
take advantage of the generating function method. We emphasize that the
time-averaged limit measure is symmetric for the origin, however, the weight
function in the weak limit measure is asymmetric in general, which implies that
the weak convergence theorem represents the asymmetry of the probability
distribution. Furthermore, the weak limit measure heavily depends on the phase
of the defect and initial state of the walker. Comparing with our previous
studies, we also show some numerical results of the probability distribution to
confirm that our result is relevant mathematically, and consider the effect of
changing the phase and initial coin state on the probability distribution, or
the ballistic spreading, which is one of the motivations of our study.

applications, including medical diagnostics and label-free biosensing.
Recently, it has been shown that Raman spectroscopy of proteins can be used to
diagnose some diseases, including a few types of cancer. These experiments have
however been performed using traditional Raman spectroscopy and the development
of the Surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) assays suitable for large
biomolecules could lead to a substantial decrease in the amount of specimen
necessary for these experiments. We present a new method to achieve high local
field enhancement in surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy through the
simultaneous adjustment of the lattice plasmons and localized surface plasmon
polaritons, in a periodic bilayer nanoantenna array resulting in a high
enhancement factor over the sensing area, with relatively high uniformity. The
proposed plasmonic nanostructure is comprised of two interacting nanoantenna
layers, providing a sharp band-edge lattice plasmon mode and a wide-band
localized surface plasmon for the separate enhancement of the pump and emitted
Raman signals. We demonstrate the application of the proposed nanostructure for
the spectral analysis of large biomolecules by binding a protein (streptavidin)
selectively on the hot-spots between the two stacked layers, using a low
concentration solution (100 nM) and we successfully acquire its SERS spectrum.

texture images by combining information from interior and boundary measures of
the Minkowski dilation applied to the texture surface. At first, the image is
converted into a surface where the height of each point is the gray intensity
of the respective pixel in that position in the image. Thus, this surface is
morphologically dilated by spheres. The radius of such spheres is ranged within
an interval and the volume and the external area of the dilated structure are
computed for each radius. The final descriptors are given by such measures
concatenated and subject to a canonical transform to reduce the dimensionality.
The proposal is an enhancement to the classical Bouligand-Minkowski fractal
descriptors, where only the volume (interior) information is considered. As
different structures may have the same volume, but not the same area, the
proposal yields to more rich descriptors as confirmed by results on the
classification of benchmark databases.

to investigate the structure of set families with few disjoint pairs. Friedgut
and Regev proved a general removal lemma, showing that when $\gamma n \le k \le
(\tfrac12 - \gamma)n$, a set family with few disjoint pairs can be made
intersecting by removing few sets.
  We provide a simple proof of a removal lemma for large families, showing that
families of size close to $\ell \binom{n-1}{k-1}$ with relatively few disjoint
pairs must be close to a union of $\ell$ stars. Our lemma holds for a wide

systems, two-body contributions vanish as two-body collisions in one dimension
only exchange momentum and thus cannot change the one-particle distribution.
Using a Kac factor in the interparticle potential implies a scaling of the
dynamics proportional to $N^\delta$ with $\delta=1$ except for one-dimensional
homogeneous systems. For the latter different values for $\delta$ were reported
for a few models. Recently it was show by Rocha Filho and collaborators [Phys.\
Rev.\ E {\bf 90}, 032133 (2014)] for the Hamiltonian mean-field model that
$\delta=2$ provided that $N$ is sufficiently large, while small $N$ effects

increasing $N$. We also explain from theoretical consideration why usual
kinetic theory fails for small $N$ values, which ultimately is the origin of
non-integer exponents in the scaling.

The surface morphology of the image is analyzed before and during the
application of the transition function of the cellular automaton. In each

of the attributes of the texture descriptor. In a final step, this texture
descriptor is used for image classification by applying Linear Discriminant
Analysis. The method was tested on the well-known Brodatz and Vistex databases.

maintaining sampling efficiency.
  We analyze a linear model of the system, where the joint effect of the
spatial modulation, blurring, and spatial subsampling is represented by a
measurement matrix. We provide a bound on the conditioning of this measurement
matrix in terms of the number of masks, the dimension of the image, and certain
characteristics of the blurring kernel and subsampling operator. The derived
bound shows that stable deconvolution is possible with high probability even if
the total number of (scalar) measurements is within a logarithmic factor of the
image size. Furthermore, beyond a critical number of masks determined by the
extent of blurring and subsampling, every additional mask improves the
conditioning of the measurement matrix.
  We also consider a more interesting scenario where the target image is
sparse. We show that under mild conditions on the blurring kernel, with high
probability the measurement matrix is a restricted isometry when the number of
masks is within a logarithmic factor of the sparsity of the image. Therefore,
the image can be reconstructed using many sparse recovery algorithms such as
the basis pursuit. The bound on the required number of masks is linear in
sparsity of the image but it is logarithmic in its dimension. The bound
provides a quantitative view of the effect of the blurring and subsampling on

GLSB galaxies are optically faint, dark-matter dominated systems that are
poorly evolved and have large HI gas disks. Our sample consists of GLSB
galaxies that show signatures of nuclear activity in their optical spectra. We
detect radio emission from the nuclei of all the seven galaxies. Five galaxies
have nuclear spectral indices that range from 0.12 to -0.44 and appear to be
core-dominated; the two galaxies have a steeper spectrum. Two of the galaxies,
UGC 2936 and UGC 4422 show significant radio emission from their disks. In our
610 MHz observations of UGC 6614, we detect radio lobes associated with the
radio-loud active galactic nucleus (AGN). The lobes have a spectral index of
-1.06+/-0.12. The star formation rates estimated from the radio emission, for
the entire sample range from 0.15 to 3.6 M{solar} yr^{-1} . We compare the
radio images with the near-ultraviolet (NUV) images from GALEX and
near-infrared (NIR) images from 2MASS. The galaxies present a diversity of
relative NUV, NIR and radio emission, supporting an episodic star formation
scenario for these galaxies. Four galaxies are classified members of groups and
one is classified as isolated. Our multiwavlength study of this sample suggests
that the environment plays an important role in the evolution of these

Edery & Paranjape (1998), where we use as input the geometric halo radius
$R_{\text{WR}}$ from Weyl gravity and equate it with the dark matter radius
$R_{\text{DM}}$ from EiBI gravity for the same halo boundary. This input then
shows that the known fitted values of $\rho _{0}$ obey the constraint
$\rho_{0}\leq\rho_{0}^{\text{upper}}\propto $ ($R_{\text{WR}}$)$^{-2}$. Using
the mass-to-light ratios giving $\alpha $, we shall also evaluate $\rho

reasonably well against many dark matter dominated low surface brightness (LSB)
galaxies for which values of $\rho _{0}$ are independently known. The interval
holds also in the case of Milky Way galaxy. Qualitatively, the existence of a
stability induced upper limit $\rho _{0}^{\text{upper}}$ is a remarkable
prediction of the EiBI theory.

point out that the ""cut and paste"" construction does not guarantee a
well-defined manifold because there is no overlap of coordinates across the
shell. When one requires that the spacetime metric across the thin shell is
continuous, it also provides a way to specify the tangent space and the
manifold. Other authors have shown that this specification leads to the
conservation laws when shells collide. On the other hand, the well-known areal
radius $r$ seems to be a perfect coordinate covering all regions of a
spherically symmetric spacetime. However, we show by simple but rigorous
arguments that $r$ fails to be a coordinate covering a neighborhood of the thin
shell if the metric across the shell is continuous. When two spherical shells
collide and merge into one, we show that it is possible that $r$ remains to be
a good coordinate and the conservation laws hold. To make this happen,
different spacetime regions divided by the shells must be glued in a specific
way such that some constraints are satisfied. We compare our new construction
with the old one by solving constraints numerically.

with constant frequency drifts [11 events], (III) single or multiple events
with increasing or decreasing frequency drift rates [52 events], and (IV)
complex events containing multiple events occurring at the same time in the
different frequency range [31 events]. Many DPSs are associated with hard X-ray
bursts (15-25 keV) and soft X-ray gradient peaks, as they typically occurred at
the beginning of the hard X-ray peaks. This indicates that DPS events are
related to the processes of fast energy release and particle acceleration.
Furthermore, interpreting DPSs as signatures of plasmoids, we measured their
ejection velocity, their width and their height from the DPS spectra, from
which we also estimated the reconnection rate and the plasma beta. In this
interpretation, constant frequency drift indicates a constant velocity of a
plasmoid, and an increasing/decreasing frequency drift indicates a
deceleration/acceleration of a plasmoid ejection. The reconnection rate shows a
good positive correlation with the plasmoid velocity. Finally we confirmed that
some DPS events show plasmoid counterparts in AIA/SDO images.

inverse covariance matrices. We give a very fast algorithm for computation of
these covariance and inverse covariance matrices which is easily scalable to
large scale data analysis problems. The simulation study for varying sample

several other estimators for various choices of structured covariance and

photons from starburst galaxies. Using 2-D axisymmetric hydrodynamic
simulations, we study superbubbles created by overlapping supernovae in OB
associations. We calculate the escape fraction of ionizing photons from the
center of the disk along different angles through the superbubble and the gas
disk. After convolving with the luminosity function of OB associations, we show
that the ionizing photons escape within a cone of $\sim 40 ^\circ$, consistent
with observations of nearby galaxies. The evolution of the escape fraction with
time shows that it falls initially as cold gas is accumulated in a dense shell.
After the shell crosses a few scale heights and fragments, the escape fraction
through the polar regions rises again. The angle-averaged escape fraction
cannot exceed $\sim [1- \cos (1 \, {\rm radian})] = 0.5$ from geometrical
considerations (using the emission cone opening angle). We calculate the
dependence of the time- and angle-averaged escape fraction on the mid-plane
disk gas density (in the range $n_0=0.15-50$ cm $^{-3}$) and the disk scale
height (between $z_0=10-600$ pc). We find that the escape fraction is related
to the disk parameters (the mid-plane disk density and scale height) roughly so
that $f_{\rm esc}^\alpha n_0^2 z_0^3$ (with $\alpha\approx 2.2$) is a constant.
For disks with a given WNM temperature, massive disks have lower escape
fraction than low mass galaxies. For Milky Way ISM parameters, we find $f_{\rm
esc}\sim 5\%$, and it increases to $\approx 10\%$ for a galaxy ten times less
massive. We discuss the possible effects of clumpiness of the ISM on the
estimate of the escape fraction and the implications of our results for the
reionization of the universe.

Grothendieck classes, under edge-doubling operations, holds as in the case
without magnetic field, but the closed formulae for specific examples like
banana graphs differ in the presence of magnetic field. We give examples of

real zeros, and find a similar exponential growth with the size of the graph.

applications. When observations are uniformly sampled from the underlying
matrix entries, existing methods all require the matrix to be incoherent. This
paper provides the first working method for coherent matrix completion under
the standard uniform sampling model. Our approach is based on the weighted
nuclear norm minimization idea proposed in several recent work, and our key
contribution is a practical method to compute the weighting matrices so that
the leverage scores become more uniform after weighting. Under suitable
conditions, we are able to derive theoretical results, showing the
effectiveness of our approach. Experiments on synthetic data show that our
approach recovers highly coherent matrices with high precision, whereas the
standard unweighted method fails even on noise-free data.

higher than 2 GeV has been scarce. Huge amounts of experimental data of the
multipion photoproduction have been accumulated, and more can be expected in
the future in facilities such as JLab 12 GeV. It makes it possible to
investigate the decay of a nucleon resonance into another nucleon resonance.
Purpose: The possibility to research the decay of the $N(2120)$ to nucleon
resonances near 1.7 GeV in the three-pion photoproduction will be explored to
provide useful information for future experimental study. Method: The pion and
radiative decay amplitudes of nucleon resonances are studied within the
constituent quark model, which is used to calculate the couplings constants,
especially for the decay of a nucleon resonance near 2.1 GeV to another nucleon
resonance near 1.7 GeV. The three-pion photoproduction off the neutron target,
i.e.,$\gamma n \to\pi^{-}\pi^{-}\Delta^{++}\to \pi^{-}\pi^{-}\pi^+ p$, is
investigated based on the effective Lagrangian method with the coupling
constant obtained form the decay amplitudes. Results: The resonance
contribution with a state $N(^2P_M)\frac{3}{2}^{-}$ near 2.1 GeV decaying to a
state $N(^4P_M)\frac{5}{2}^{-}$ near 1.7 GeV, i.\ e., $N(2120)\to N(1675)\pi$
is dominant in the process considered. The total cross section from the
resonance contribution is at the order of 1 $\mu$b and can be easily
distinguished from the background. Conclusions: Our results suggest it is
practicable to research the decay of the $N(2120)$ to the $N(1675)$ in
experiment.

Quadrature Amplifier and Noiseless Quadrature Transducers. These NC corrections
alter the nature of the measurement interaction, as a noiseless interaction may
acquire noise, and an interaction of independent intervention may become
dependent of the object system. However the most striking result is that
noncommutativity may lead to a violation of the OUP itself. The NC corrections
for the Backaction Evading Quadrature Amplifier reveal a new term which may
potentially be amplified in such a way that the violation of the OUP becomes
experimentally testable. On the other hand, the NC corrections to the Noiseless
Quadrature Transducer shows an incompatibility of this model with NC quantum
mechanics. We discuss the implications of this incompatibility for NC quantum
mechanics and for Ozawa's uncertainty principle.

we developed an upwind finite element method to investigate the pattern
formation and the hydrodynamical stability of the system. The numerical
simulations illustrate different predicted physical regimes in the system. In
the convective regime, the predicted plumes resemble B\'enard instabilities.
Our numerical results show how structured layers of bacteria are formed before
bacterium rich plumes fall in the fluid. The plumes have a well defined
spectrum of wavelengths and have an exponential growth rate, yet their position
can only be predicted in very simple examples. In the chemotactic and diffusive
regimes, the effects of chemotaxis are investigated. Our results indicate that
the chemotaxis can stabilize the overall system. A time scale analysis has been
performed to demonstrate that the critical taxis Rayleigh number for which
instabilities set in depends on the chemotaxis head and sensitivity. In
addition, the comparison of the differential systems of
chemotaxis-diffusion-convection, double diffusive convection, and
Rayleigh-B\'enard convection establishes a set of evidences that even if the
physical mechanisms are different at the same time the dimensionless systems
are strongly related to each other.
