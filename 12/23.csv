high-intensity discharge lamps at frequencies of approximately 300 kHz.
However, operating lamps at these high frequencies bears the risk of
stimulating acoustic resonances inside the arc tube, which can result in low
frequency light flicker and even lamp destruction. The acoustic streaming
effect has been identified as the link between high frequency resonances and
low frequency flicker. A highly coupled 3D multiphysics model has been set up
to calculate the acoustic streaming velocity field inside the arc tube of
high-intensity discharge lamps. It has been found that the velocity field
suffers a phase transition to an asymmetrical state at a critical acoustic
streaming force. The system behaves similar to a ferromagnet near the Curie
point. Furthermore, it is discussed how the model allows to investigate the
light flicker phenomenon. Concerning computer resources the procedure is
considerably less demanding than a direct approach with a transient model.

formation history within each structure in our simulated volume. We vary the
structure measure threshold to probe the complex inner structure of star
forming regions in poor clusters, filaments and voids. We find the majority of
star formation occurs in cold, condensed gas in filaments at intermediate
redshifts (z ~ 3). We also show that much of the star formation above a
redshift z = 3 occurs in low contrast regions of filaments, but as the density
contrast increases at lower redshift star formation switches to the high
contrast regions, or inner parts, of filaments. Since filaments bridge the void
and cluster regions, it suggests that the majority of star formation occurs in
galaxies in intermediate density regions prior to the accretion onto poor
clusters. We find that at the present epoch, the gas phase distribution is
43.1%, 30.0%, 24.7% and 2.2% in the diffuse, WHIM, hot halo and condensed
phases, respectively. The majority of the WHIM is associated with filaments.
However, their multiphase nature and the fact that the star formation occurs
predominantly in the condensed gas both point to the importance of not
conflating the filamentary environment with the WHIM. Moreover, in our
simulation volume 8.77%, 79.1%, 2.11% of the gas at z = 0 is located in poor

related to a decrease of the exciton transition oscillator strength and,
therefore, to the irradiation-induced destruction of the excitonic states, but
can be rather ascribed to a common cause, namely, to inhomogeneous broadening
of the excitonic resonances proportional to the exposure dose.A tentative model
of the irradiation-induced broadening is considered, with the mechanism of the
process being a consequence of scat-tering of the 2D excitons by structural
defects associated with Ga(In) and As vacancies arising upon collisions of the

itinerant ferromagnet with a topological spin-triplet superconductor having
different number of time-reversal-invariant Majorana helical modes. Depending
on the number of helical modes, the capacity of carrying spin and charge
currents is shown to be directly related to the amplitude and orientation of
the ferromagnetic magnetization with respect to the superconducting
$\vec{d}$-vector. Differently from the one-helical mode spin-triplet
superconductor, we find that the presence of a finite amount of electronic
hybridization with the two pairs of Majorana helical modes leads to
nonvanishing charge current independently of the ferromagnetic exchange. The
competition between the two pairs of Majorana helical modes remarkably yields a
spin-current response that is almost constant in the range of weak to
intermediate ferromagnetism. The behavior of the spin current is tightly linked
to the direction of the spin-polarization in the ferromagnet and tends to be
flatten for a magnetization that is coplanar to the spin-triplet
$\vec{d}$-vector independently of the number of helical modes.

present results for fine-grained categorization better than the

to direct high resolution attention to the most discriminative regions without
any spatial supervision such as bounding boxes, and it is able to discriminate
fine-grained dog breeds moderately well even when given only an initial
low-resolution context image and narrow, inexpensive glimpses at faces and fur

(matrix) data by combining two recent innovations from different fields: the
Sparse Subspace Clustering (SSC) algorithm [10], which groups points coming
from a union of subspaces into their respective subspaces, and the t-product
[18], which was introduced to provide a matrix-like multiplication for third
order tensors. Our algorithm is analogous to SSC in that an ""affinity"" between
different data points is built using a sparse self-representation of the data.
Unlike SSC, we employ the t-product in the self-representation. This allows us
more flexibility in modeling; infact, SSC is a special case of our method. When
using the t-product, three-way arrays are treated as matrices whose elements
(scalars) are n-tuples or tubes. Convolutions take the place of scalar
multiplication. This framework allows us to embed the 2-D data into a
vector-space-like structure called a free module over a commutative ring. These
free modules retain many properties of complex inner-product spaces, and we
leverage that to provide theoretical guarantees on our algorithm. We show that
compared to vector-space counterparts, SSmC achieves higher accuracy and better
able to cluster data with less preprocessing in some image clustering problems.
In particular we show the performance of the proposed method on Weizmann face
database, the Extended Yale B Face database and the MNIST handwritten digits
database.

civilians during a disaster based on real-time decisions using a pre-defined
algorithm and live sensory data. Hence, casualties caused by the poor decisions
and guidance are only apparent at the end of the evacuation process and cannot
then be remedied. Previous research shows that the performance of routing
algorithms for evacuation purposes are sensitive to the initial distribution of
evacuees, the occupancy levels, the type of disaster and its as well its
locations. Thus an algorithm that performs well in one scenario may achieve bad
results in another scenario. This problem is especially serious in
heuristic-based routing algorithms for evacuees where results are affected by
the choice of certain parameters. Therefore, this paper proposes a
simulation-based evacuee routing algorithm that optimises evacuation by making
use of the high computational power of cloud servers. Rather than guiding
evacuees with a predetermined routing algorithm, a robust Cognitive Packet
Network based algorithm is first evaluated via a cloud-based simulator in a
faster-than-real-time manner, and any ""simulated casualties"" are then re-routed
using a variant of Dijkstra's algorithm to obtain new safe paths for them to
exits. This approach can be iterated as long as corrective action is still

solution of the model which re-expressed it in terms of topological excitations
- the vortices with interactions only in space but none in time, and warps with
leading interactions only in time but none in space, as well as sub-leading
interactions which are both space and time-dependent. For parameters for which
the proliferation of warps dominates the phase transition, the critical
fluctuations as a function of the deviation of the dissipation parameter
$\alpha$ from its critical value $\alpha_c$ are scale-invariant in imaginary
time $\tau$ as the correlation length in time $\xi_{\tau} = \tau_c
e^{|\alpha_c/(\alpha_c-\alpha)|^{1/2}}$ diverges. On the other hand, the
spatial correlations develop with a correlation length $\xi_x \approx \xi_0
\log{(\xi_{\tau})}$, with $\xi_0$ of the order of a lattice constant. The
dynamic correlation exponent $z$ is therefore $\infty$. These results are
consistent with the phenomenology proposed for the strange metal properties of
the cuprates. The Monte-Carlo calculations also directly show warps and
vortices. Their density and correlations across the various transitions in the
model are calculated and related to those of the order parameter in the

90 degrees in the sky. By using basic concepts of slit spectroscopy we show
that the geometry of composite systems can be reliably retrieved by measuring
only radial velocity differences taken with different slit angles. The spatial
resolution is determined by the precision with which differential radial

the known spectroscopic binary star HD 188088 (HIP 97944), which has a maximum
expected separation of 23 milli-arcseconds. We measure an astrometric signal in
radial velocity of 276 \ms, which corresponds to a separation between the two
components at the time of the observations of 18 $\pm2$ milli-arcseconds. The
stars were aligned east-west. We describe a simple optical device to
simultaneously record pairs of spectra rotated by 180 degrees, thus reducing
systematic effects. We compute and provide the function expressing the shift of
the centroid of a seeing-limited image in the presence of a narrow slit.The
proposed technique is simple to use and our test shows that it is amenable for
deriving astrometry with milli-arcsecond accuracy or better, beyond the
diffraction limit of the telescope. The technique can be further improved by
using simple devices to simultaneously record the spectra with 180 degrees
angles.With tachoastrometry, radial velocities and astrometric positions can be
measured simultaneously for many double line system binaries in an easy way.
The method is not limited to binary stars, but can be applied to any
astrophysical configuration in which spectral lines are generated by separate
(non-rotational symmetric) regions.

Chem. Chem. Phys. 16, 6602, 2014]. In present report, the capacity of the
positively charged muon in forming its own AIM is considered in a large set of
molecules replacing muons with all protons in the hydrides of the second and
third rows of the Periodic Table. Accordingly, in a comparative study the
wavefunctions of both sets of hydrides and their muonic congeners are first
derived beyond the Born-Oppenheimer (BO) paradigm, assuming protons and muons
as quantum waves instead of clamped particles. Then, the non-BO wavefunctions
are used to derive the AIM structures of both hydrides and muonic congeners
within context of the multi-component quantum theory of atoms in molecules. The
results of the analysis demonstrate that muons are generally capable of forming
their own atomic basins and the properties of these basins are not
fundamentally different from those AIM containing protons. Particularly, the
bonding modes in the muonic species seem to be qualitatively similar to their
congener hydrides and no new bonding models is required to describe the bonding
of muons to a diverse set of neighboring atoms. All in all, the positively
charged muon is similar to proton from structural and bonding viewpoint and
deserved to be placed in the same box of hydrogen in the Periodic Table. This
conclusion is in line with a large body of studies on the chemical kinetics of

interest in identifying ecological, geographic, and other factors that affect
rates of species proliferation. Recent methods for explicitly modeling the
relationships among character states, speciation rates, and extinction rates on
phylogenetic trees- BiSSE, QuaSSE, GeoSSE, and related models - have been
widely used to test hypotheses about character state-dependent diversification
rates. Here, we document the disconcerting ease with which neutral traits are
inferred to have statistically significant associations with speciation rate.
We first demonstrate this unfortunate effect for a known model assumption
violation: shifts in speciation rate associated with a character not included
in the model. We further show that for many empirical phylogenies, characters
simulated in the absence of state-dependent diversification exhibit an even
higher Type I error rate, indicating that the method is susceptible to
additional, unknown model inadequacies. For traits that evolve slowly, the root
cause appears to be a statistical framework that does not require replicated
shifts in character state and diversification. However, spurious associations
between character state and speciation rate arise even for traits that lack
phylogenetic signal, suggesting that phylogenetic pseudoreplication alone
cannot fully explain the problem. The surprising severity of this phenomenon
suggests that many trait-diversification relationships reported in the
literature may not be real. More generally, we highlight the need for
diagnosing and understanding the consequences of model inadequacy in
phylogenetic comparative methods.

compact body in perturbation theory up to second order in General Relativity.
The interior of the body is a perfect fluid with a barotropic equation of
state, no convective motions and rigid rotation. That interior is matched
across its surface to an asymptotically flat vacuum exterior. Perturbations are
taken to second order around a static and spherically symmetric background
configuration. Apart from the explicit assumptions, the perturbed configuration
is constructed upon some implicit premises, in particular the continuity of the
functions describing the perturbation in terms of some background radial
coordinate. In this work we revisit the model within a modern general and
consistent theory of perturbative matchings to second order, which is
independent of the coordinates and gauges used to describe the two regions to
be joined. We explore the matching conditions up to second order in full. The
main particular result we present is that the radial function $m_0$ (in the
setting of the original work) of the second order perturbation tensor, contrary
to the original assumption, presents a jump at the surface of the star, which
is proportional to the value of the energy density of the background
configuration there. As a consequence, the change in mass needed by the
perturbed configuration to keep the value of the central energy density
unchanged must be amended. We also discuss some subtleties that arise when
studying the deformation of the star.

sparse prediction targets of very high dimension D. These occur naturally in
e.g. neural language models or the learning of word-embeddings, often posed as
predicting the probability of next words among a vocabulary of size D (e.g. 200
000). Computing the equally large, but typically non-sparse D-dimensional
output vector from a last hidden layer of reasonable dimension d (e.g. 500)
incurs a prohibitive O(Dd) computational cost for each example, as does
updating the D x d output weight matrix and computing the gradient needed for
backpropagation to previous layers. While efficient handling of large sparse
network inputs is trivial, the case of large sparse targets is not, and has
thus so far been sidestepped with approximate alternatives such as hierarchical
softmax or sampling-based approximations during training. In this work we
develop an original algorithmic approach which, for a family of loss functions
that includes squared error and spherical softmax, can compute the exact loss,
gradient update for the output weights, and gradient for backpropagation, all
in O(d^2) per example instead of O(Dd), remarkably without ever computing the
D-dimensional output. The proposed algorithm yields a speedup of D/4d , i.e.
two orders of magnitude for typical sizes, for that critical part of the

estimate that a sub-picosecond laser pulse with a moderate fluence of ~ 1

the optically perturbed balance between the exchange parameters. Our findings
are supported by a low-energy theory for the microscopic magnetic interactions

work substantiating the near validity of the adiabatic approximation in
coupled-channel calculations for scattering on statically deformed nuclei, we
explore the possibility of generalizing a global spherical optical model

of collective couplings and nuclear deformations on integrated cross sections
as well as on angular distributions for neutron-induced reactions on statically

rare-earth elements (Gd, Ho, W), which are known to be nearly perfect rotors,
to exemplify the results of the proposed method. Predictions from our model for

the evolution of the number states of the oscillator as a function of the

displacements aligned with the squeezed and anti-squeezed axes. We observe
coherent revivals when inverting the state-dependent force after separating the

thousands of active elements at the base stations and performing coherent
transceiver processing. A common rule-of-thumb is that these systems should
have an order of magnitude more antennas, $M$, than scheduled users, $K$,
because the users' channels are likely to be near-orthogonal when $M/K > 10$.
However, it has not been proved that this rule-of-thumb actually maximizes the
SE. In this paper, we analyze how the optimal number of scheduled users,
$K^\star$, depends on $M$ and other system parameters. To this end, new SE
expressions are derived to enable efficient system-level analysis with power
control, arbitrary pilot reuse, and random user locations. The value of
$K^\star$ in the large-$M$ regime is derived in closed form, while simulations
are used to show what happens at finite $M$, in different interference
scenarios, with different pilot reuse factors, and for different processing
schemes. Up to half the coherence block should be dedicated to pilots and the
optimal $M/K$ is less than 10 in many cases of practical relevance.
Interestingly, $K^\star$ depends strongly on the processing scheme and hence it
is unfair to compare different schemes using the same $K$.

important testbeds for our best contemporary theories of physics. Historically,
interference has been used to contrast quantum mechanics to classical physics,
but recently experiments have been performed that test quantum theory against
even more exotic alternatives. A physically motivated family of theories are
those where the state space of a two-level system is given by a sphere of
arbitrary dimension. This includes classical bits, and real, complex and
quaternionic quantum theory. In this paper, we consider relativity of
simultaneity (that observers may disagree about the order of events at
different locations) as applied to a two-armed interferometer, and show that
this forbids most interference phenomena more complicated than those of complex
quantum theory. If interference must depend on some relational property of the
setting (such as path difference), then relativity of simultaneity will limit
state spaces to standard complex quantum theory, or a subspace thereof. If this
relational assumption is relaxed, we find one additional theory compatible with
relativity of simultaneity: quaternionic quantum theory. Our results have
consequences for current laboratory interference experiments: they have to be
designed carefully to avoid rendering beyond-quantum effects invisible by
relativity of simultaneity.

Multipliers (ADMM). The goal is to distributively optimize a global objective
function over a network of decision makers under linear constraints. The global
objective function is composed of convex cost functions associated with each
agent. The local cost functions, on the other hand, are assumed to have been
decomposed into two distinct convex functions, one of which is revealed to the
decision makers over time and one known a priori. In addition, the agents must
achieve consensus on the global variable that relates to the private local
variables via linear constraints. In this work, we extend online ADMM to a
distributed setting based on dual-averaging and distributed gradient descent.
We then propose a performance metric for such online distributed algorithms and
explore the performance of the sequence of decisions generated by the algorithm
as compared with the best fixed decision in hindsight. This performance metric
is called the social regret. A sub-linear upper bound on the social regret of
the proposed algorithm is then obtained that underscores the role of the
underlying network topology and certain condition measures associated with the
linear constraints. The online distributed ADMM algorithm is then applied to a
formation acquisition problem demonstrating the application of the proposed
setup in distributed robotics.

Karlsson, there are no divergent 1PI structures beyond 6 loops in D=4 N=8

divergences do not appear at less than 7 loops, this may imply that the 4-point
amplitude in D=4 N=8 supergravity is all-loop finite. This differs from the
result of the previous studies of pure spinors, which suggested that there is a
UV divergence at 7 loops in D=4. Therefore an independent investigation of the
pure spinor formalism predictions is desirable, as well as continuation of
explicit loop computations. In the meantime, we revisit here our earlier
arguments on UV finiteness of N=8 supergravity based on the absence of the
off-shell light-cone superspace counterterms, as well as on the E_{7(7)}

first discuss issues such as a valid way of defining importance for the main

computationally attractive for large p problems but regarded heuristic in the

underpins practical applications of their most basic quantum property --- the

nanostructure connected to source and drain leads; in the regime of quantized
pumping the current varies in steps of $q_e f$ as function of control
parameters, where $q_e$ is the electron charge and $f$ is the frequency of
modulation. In recent years, robust and accurate quantized charge pumps have
been developed based on semiconductor quantum dots with tunable tunnel

dot and the leads over many orders of magnitude and enable trapping of a
precise number of electrons far away from equilibrium with the leads. The

distribution $u\in\mathcal{S}'(\mathbb{R}^{d})$ in terms of its continuous
wavelet transform, where the latter is defined with respect to a suitably
chosen dilation group $H\subset{\rm GL}(\mathbb{R}^{d})$. In this paper we
develop a comprehensive and unified approach that allows to establish
characterizations of the wavefront set in terms of rapid coefficient decay, for
a large variety of dilation groups.
  For this purpose, we introduce two technical conditions on the dual action of
the group $H$, called microlocal admissibilty and (weak) cone approximation
property. Essentially, microlocal admissibilty sets up a systematical
relationship between the scales in a wavelet dilated by $h\in H$ on one side,
and the matrix norm of $h$ on the other side. The (weak) cone approximation
property describes the ability of the wavelet system to adapt its
frequency-side localization to arbitrary frequency cones. Together, microlocal
admissibility and the weak cone approximation property allow the
characterization of points in the wavefront set using multiple wavelets.
Replacing the weak cone approximation by its stronger counterpart gives access
to single wavelet characterizations.
  We illustrate the scope of our results by discussing -- in any dimension
$d\ge2$ -- the similitude, diagonal and shearlet dilation groups, for which we
verify the pertinent conditions. As a result, similitude and diagonal groups
can be employed for multiple wavelet characterizations, whereas for the
shearlet groups a single wavelet suffices. In particular, the shearlet
characterization (previously only established for $d=2$) holds in arbitrary
dimensions.

states of two dimensional CFTs with a large central charge limit. We prove this
conjecture for 2D CFTs which are orbifolds by permutation groups. In
particular, we characterize those permutation groups which give CFTs with
well-defined large N limits and can thus serve as holographic duals to bulk
gravity theories in AdS_3. We then show that the holographic dual of a
permutation orbifold will have a Hagedorn spectrum in the large N limit. This
is evidence that, within this landscape, every theory of quantum gravity with a
semi-classical limit is a string theory.

galaxy sample consists of ~14,000 PRIMUS galaxies within z = 0.2-0.8 and
~64,000 SDSS galaxies within z = 0.05-0.12. We classify the galaxies as
quiescent or star-forming based on an evolving specific star formation cut, and
as low or high density environments based on fixed cylindrical aperture
environment measurements on a volume-limited environment defining population.
For quiescent and star-forming galaxies in low or high density environments, we
examine the evolution of their stellar mass function (SMF). Then using the SMFs
we compute $f_\mathrm{Q}(M_{*})$ and quantify its evolution within our redshift
range. We find that the quiescent fraction is higher at higher masses and in
denser environments. The quiescent fraction rises with cosmic time for all
masses and environments. At a fiducial mass of $10^{10.5}M_\odot$, from z~0.7

25% at the highest environments we measure. These results suggest that for a
minority of galaxies their cessation of star formation is due to external
influences on them. However, in the recent Universe a substantial fraction of

condensate to detuning quenches within the two channel model beyond the weak
coupling BCS limit. At long times after the quench, the condensate ends up in
one of three main asymptotic states (nonequilibrium phases), which are
qualitatively similar to those in other fermionic condensates defined by a
global complex order parameter. In phase I the amplitude of the order parameter
vanishes as a power law, in phase II it goes to a nonzero constant, and in
phase III it oscillates persistently. We construct exact quench phase diagrams
that predict the asymptotic state (including the many-body wavefunction)
depending on the initial and final detunings and on the Feshbach resonance
width. Outside of the weak coupling regime, both the mechanism and the time
dependence of the relaxation of the amplitude of the order parameter in phases
I and II are modified. Also, quenches from arbitrarily weak initial to
sufficiently strong final coupling do not produce persistent oscillations in
contrast to the behavior in the BCS regime. The most remarkable feature of
coherent condensate dynamics in various fermion superfluids is an effective
reduction in the number of dynamic degrees of freedom as the evolution time
goes to infinity. As a result, the long time dynamics can be fully described in
terms of just a few new collective dynamical variables governed by the same
Hamiltonian only with ""renormalized"" parameters. Combining this feature with
the integrability of the underlying (e.g. the two channel) model, we develop
and consistently present a general method that explicitly obtains the exact

sidewall on the heat transport in Rayleigh-B\'enard (RB) convection using
direct numerical simulations. For relatively low Rayleigh numbers Ra the heat
transport is higher when the sidewall is isothermal, kept at a temperature
$T_c+\Delta/2$ (where $\Delta$ is the temperature difference between the
horizontal plates and $T_c$ the temperature of the cold plate), than when the
sidewall is adiabatic. The reason is that in the former case part of the heat
current avoids the thermal resistance of the fluid layer by escaping through
the sidewall that acts as a short-circuit. For higher Ra the bulk becomes more
isothermal and this reduces the heat current through the sidewall. Therefore
the heat flux in a cell with an isothermal sidewall converges to the value
obtained with an adiabatic sidewall for high enough Ra ($\simeq 10^{10}$).
However, when the sidewall temperature deviates from $T_c+\Delta/2$ the heat
transport at the bottom and top plates is different from the value obtained
using an adiabatic sidewall. In this case the difference does not decrease with
increasing Ra thus indicating that the ambient temperature of the experimental
apparatus can influence the heat transfer. A similar behavior is observed when
only a very small sidewall region close to the horizontal plates is kept
isothermal, while the rest of the sidewall is adiabatic. The reason is that in
the region closest to the horizontal plates the temperature difference between
the fluid and the sidewall is highest. This suggests that one should be careful
with the placement of thermal shields outside the fluid sample to minimize
spurious heat currents.

independent pure states are known to have an interesting structure; for such a
given ensemble the optimal POVM is given by the pretty good measurment of
another ensemble which can be related to the former ensemble by a bijective
mapping $\mathscr{R}$ on the ""space of ensembles"". In this paper we generalize
this result to ensembles of general linearly independent states (not
necessarily pure) and also give an analytic expression for the inverse of the
map, i.e., for $\mathscr{R}^{-1}$. In the process of proving this we also
simplify the necessary and sufficient conditions that a POVM needs to satisfy
to maximize the probability of success for the MED of an LI ensemble of states.
This simplification is then employed to arrive at a rotationally invariant
necessary and sufficient conditions of optimality. Using these rotationally
invariant conditions it is established that every state of a LI mixed state
ensemble can be resolved to a pure state decomposition so that the
corresponding pure state ensemble (corresponding to pure states of all mixed
states together) has as its optimal POVM a pure state decomposition of the
optimal POVM of mixed state ensemble. This gives the necessary and sufficient
conditions for the PGM of a LI ensemble to be its optimal POVM; another
generalization for the pure state case. Also, these rotationally invariant
conditions suggest a technique to give the optimal POVM for an ensemble of LI
states. This technique is polynomial in time and outpeforms standard

surface to a liquid due to several mechanisms many of which are not understood
in quantitative detail. An important component of the overall process is that
the buoyancy of the bubbles compounds with that of the liquid to give rise to a
much enhanced natural convection. In this paper we focus specifically on this
enhancement and present a numerical study of the resulting two-phase
Rayleigh-B\'enard convection process. We make no attempt to model other aspects
of the boiling process such as bubble nucleation and detachment. We consider a
cylindrical cell with a diameter equal to its height. The cell base and top are
held at temperatures above and below the boiling point of the liquid,
respectively. By keeping the temperature difference constant and changing the
liquid pressure we study the effect of the liquid superheat in a Rayleigh
number range that, in the absence of boiling, would be between $2\times10^6$
and $5\times10^9$. We find a considerable enhancement of the heat transfer and
study its dependence on the bubble number, the degree of superheat of the hot
cell bottom and the Rayleigh number. The increased buoyancy provided by the
bubbles leads to more energetic hot plumes detaching from the hot cell bottom
and, as a consequence, the strength of the circulation in the cell is
significantly increased. Our results are in general agreement with recent
experimental results of Zhong et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 102}, 124501 (2009)

factor reveals a transition from a highly compressible critical liquid to a
quasi-solid regime. In the low-energy limit, the dynamical structure factor can
be described by the quantum hydrodynamic Luttinger liquid theory, with a
Luttinger parameter spanning all possible values by increasing the density. At
higher energies, our approach provides quantitative results beyond the

between dimensionality and interaction makes the dynamical structure factor
manifest a pseudo {\it{particle-hole}} continuum typical of fermionic systems.
At the low-energy boundary of such region and moderate densities, we find
consistency, within statistical uncertainties, with predictions of a power-law

can be described by new analytical relations that we derive for the hard-rods

the model atmospheres imply effective temperatures (Teff) several hundred
Kelvin lower than predicted by the standard Pre-Main Sequence spectral
type-Teff conversion scale (based on theoretical evolutionary models). It is
only in the mid-M types that the two temperature estimates agree. (2) The Teff
discrepancy in the early M types (corresponding to stellar masses above 0.4
Msol at ages of a few Myr) probably arises from remaining uncertainties in the
treatment of atmospheric convection within the atmospheric models, whereas in
the late M types it is likely due to an underestimation of dust opacity. (3)
The empirical and model-atmosphere J-band bolometric corrections are both
roughly flat, and similar to each other, over the M-type Teff range. Thus the
model atmospheres yield reasonably accurate bolometric luminosities (Lbol), but
lead to underestimations of mass and age relative to evolutionary expectations
(especially in the late M types) due to lower Teff. We demonstrate this for a
large sample of young Cha I and Taurus sources. (4) The trends in the
atmospheric model J-K colors, and their deviations from the data, are similar
at Pre-Main Sequence and Main Sequence ages, suggesting that the model dust
opacity errors we postulate here for young ages also apply at field ages.

The mechanisms producing the variability are still controversial and different

shock-in-jet model to explain and reconstruct the observed evolution of flares
in the turnover frequency turnover flux density plane and their
frequency-dependent light curve parameters. With a detailed parameter space
study we provide the framework for future, detailed comparisons of observed
flare signatures with the shock-in-jet scenario. Based on the shock model we
compute synthetic single-dish light curves at different radio frequencies (2.6
to 345 GHz) and for different physical conditions in a conical jet (e.g.
magnetic field geometry and Doppler factor). From those we extract the slopes
of the different energy loss stages within the $\nu_\mathrm{m}$-$S_\mathrm{m}$
plane and deduce the frequency-dependence of different light curve parameters
such as flare amplitude, time scale and cross-band delays. The evolution of the
Doppler factor along the jet has the largest influence on the evolution of the
flare and on the frequency-dependent light curve parameters. The synchrotron
stage can be hidden in the Compton or in the adiabatic stage, depending mainly
on the evolution of the Doppler factor, which makes it difficult to detect its
signature in observations. In addition, we show that the time lags between

distance-to-a-measure (DTM), introduced by Chazal et al. (2011), and the kernel
distance, introduced by Phillips et al. (2014), are smooth functions that
provide useful topological information but are robust to noise and outliers.
Chazal et al. (2014) derived concentration bounds for DTM. Building on these
results, we derive limiting distributions and confidence sets, and we propose a

systematically using Lanczos algorithm, to obtain the reduced set of states

complete graphs with broken links and complete bipartite graphs, in particular,
the star graph. These examples show that regularity and high-connectivity are
not needed to achieve optimal spatial search. We also show that this method
considerably simplifies the calculation of quantum transport efficiencies.

regression model with observation error in the design. Different assumptions on
the data generating process have motivated different estimators and analysis.
In particular, the literature considered (1) observation errors in the design
uniformly bounded by some $\bar \delta$, and (2) zero mean independent
observation errors. Under the first assumption, the rates of convergence of the
proposed estimators depend explicitly on $\bar \delta$, while the second
assumption has been applied when an estimator for the second moment of the
observational error is available. This work proposes and studies two new
estimators which, compared to other procedures for regression models with
errors in the design, exploit an additional $l_{\infty}$-norm regularization.
The first estimator is applicable when both (1) and (2) hold but does not
require an estimator for the second moment of the observational error. The
second estimator is applicable under (2) and requires an estimator for the
second moment of the observation error. Importantly, we impose no assumption on
the accuracy of this pilot estimator, in contrast to the previously known
procedures. As the recent proposals, we allow the number of covariates to be
much larger than the sample size. We establish the rates of convergence of the
estimators and compare them with the bounds obtained for related estimators in
the literature. These comparisons show interesting insights on the interplay of
the assumptions and the achievable rates of convergence.

considering vehicles in order of priority, modeling higher-priority vehicles as
time-varying obstacles for lower-priority vehicles. To do this, we solve a
double-obstacle HJI VI which allows us to obtain the reach-avoid set, defined
as the set of states from which a vehicle can reach its target while staying
within a time-varying state constraint set. From the solution of the
double-obstacle HJI VI, we can also extract the latest start time and the
optimal control for each vehicle. This is a first application of the
double-obstacle HJI VI which can handle systems with time-varying dynamics,
target sets, and state constraint sets, and results in computation complexity
that scales linearly, as opposed to exponentially, with the number of vehicles
in consideration.

significantly low black hole mass. Currently, it is under discussion whether
present-day NLS1s offset from the M-sigma relation. Using the directly measured
stellar velocity dispersion of 93 NLS1s at z<0.1, and black hole mass estimates
based on the updated mass estimators, we investigate the M-sigma relation of
NLS1s in comparison with broad-line AGNs. We find no strong evidence that the
NLS1s deviates from the M-sigma relation, which is defined by
reverberation-mapped type 1 AGNs and quiescent galaxies. However, there is a
clear trend of the offset with the host galaxy morphology, i.e., more inclined
galaxies toward the line-of-sight have higher stellar velocity dispersion,
suggesting that the rotational broadening plays a role in measuring stellar
velocity dispersion based on the single-aperture spectra from the Sloan Digital
Sky Survey. In addition, we provide the virial factor log f = $0.05 \pm 0.12$
(f = 1.12), for black hole mass estimators based on the FWHM of H$\beta$, by
jointly fitting the M-sigma relation using quiescent galaxies and

curvature; the microdisks have contact lines pinned at their sharp edges and
are sufficiently small that gravitational effects are negligible. The disks
migrate away from planar regions toward regions of steep curvature with
capillary energies inferred from the dissipation along particle trajectories
which are linear in the deviatoric curvature. We derive the curvature capillary
energy for an interface with arbitrary curvature, and discuss each contribution
to the expression. By adsorbing to a curved interface, a particle eliminates a
patch of fluid interface and perturbs the surrounding interface shape. Analysis
predicts that perfectly smooth, circular disks do not migrate, and that
nanometric deviations from a planar circular, contact line, like those around a
weakly roughened planar disk, will drive migration with linear dependence on
deviatoric curvature, in agreement with experiment.

to adjust surface tension by changing the parameter in the model. However, the
density distribution and the stability of the model also depend on the

between the non-giant group (T_eff > 5000 K) and the red-giant group (T_eff <

that both have rather large dispersions of a few tenths dex caused by
insufficient data quality), though only one giant star (S 1054) appears to show
an exceptionally low O abundance and thus needs a more detailed study. This
result may suggest that oxygen content in the stellar envelope is hardly
affected (or changes are insignificant) by the mixing of H-burning products in

ultrashort laser pulses a variety of models has been invented to describe the
laser beam target interaction. In terms of basic physics collisionless
absorption is understood now as the interplay of the oscillating laser field
with the space charge field produced in the plasma. A first approach to this
idea is realized in Brunel's model the essence of which consists in the
formation of an oscillating charge cloud in the vacuum in front of the target.
The investigation of statistical ensembles of orbits shows that the absorption
process is localized at the ion-vacuum interface and in the skin layer: Single
electrons enter into resonance with the laser field thereby undergoing a phase
shift which causes orbit crossing and braking of Brunel's laminar flow. This
anharmonic resonance acts like an attractor for the electrons and leads to the
formation of a Maxwellian tail in the electron energy spectrum. Most remarkable
results of our investigations are the Brunel-like hot electron distribution at
the relativistic threshold; the minimum of absorption at $I\lambda^2 \cong
(0.3-1.2)\times 10^{21}$ W/cm$^2\mu$m$^2$, in the plasma target with the
electron density of $n_e \lambda^2\sim 10^{23}$cm$^{-3}\mu$m$^2;$ the drastic
reduction of the number of hot electrons in this domain and their reappearance
in the highly relativistic domain; strong coupling of the fast electron jets
with the return current through Cherenkov emission of plasmons. The hot
electron energy scaling shows a strong dependence on intensity in the
moderately relativistic domain $I\lambda^2 \cong (10^{18} - 10^{20})$
W/cm$^2\mu$m$^2$, a scaling in vague accordance with current published

SETH is true it might be impossible in the real world to predict the system's

determinism in a process, in which a black hole forms and then completely
evaporates, might actually be physical evidence supporting SETH.

absent in both non-SC and SC samples, but a unique superstructure with a

terrain, using actuator-disk representations of the individual wind-turbines.
We consider power from various aggregates of wind-turbines such as the total
average power signal, or signals from sub-averages within the wind-farm.
Non-trivial correlations are observed due to the complex interactions between
turbines placed downstream of each other, and they lead to noticeable spectral
peaks at frequencies associated with the inter-turbine spacings when the
wind-direction is completely fixed. In that case we observe that the frequency
spectra of the total wind-farm output show a decay that follows approximately a
$-5/3$ power-law scaling regime, qualitatively consistent with some
observations made in field-scale operational wind-parks (Apt, 2007). We find
that these features are still observed when the wind-speed varies in magnitude.
However, significant changes in the wind-direction over time tend to smooth out
the observed spectral peak and reduce the extent of the observed $-5/3$
power-law.

  Models",,,,,"hep-ph astro-ph.HE","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","  It has been realized that the shock wave effects play an important role in
neutrino oscillations during the supernova explosion. In recent years, with the
development of simulations about supernova explosion, we have a better
understanding about the density profiles and the shock waves in supernovae than
before. It has been shown that the appearance of shock waves not only varies
with time, but is also affected by the mass of the supernova. When the mass of
the supernova happens to be in a certain range (e.g. it equals 10.8 times the
mass of the sun), there might be a reverse shock wave, another sudden change of
density except the forward shock wave, emerging in the supernova. In addition,
there are some other time-dependent changes of density profiles in different
supernova models. Because of these complex density profiles, the expression of
the crossing probability at the high resonance, $P_H$, which we used previously
would be no longer applicable. In order to get more accurate and reasonable
results, we use the data of density profiles in three different supernova
models obtained from simulations to study the variations of $P_s$ (the survival
probability of $\nu_e\rightarrow\nu_e$), as well as $P_c$ (the conversion
probability of $\nu_x\rightarrow\nu_e$). It is found that the mass of the
supernova does make a difference on the behavior of $P_s$, and affects $P_c$ at
the same time. With the results of $P_s$ and $P_c$, we can estimate the number
of $\nu_e$ remained after they go through the matter in the supernova.

integrating low-level features (e.g. color, edge) to form a saliency map,
recently it has been found that the structural organization of these features
into a proto-object representation can play a more significant role. In this
work, we present a computational framework based on deep network to demonstrate
that proto-object representations can be learned from low-resolution image
patches from fixation regions. We advocate the use of low-resolution inputs in
this work due to the following reasons: (1) Proto-objects are computed in
parallel over an entire visual field (2) People can perceive or recognize
objects well even it is in low resolution. (3) Fixations from lower resolution
images can predict fixations on higher resolution images. In the proposed
computational model, we extract multi-scale image patches on fixation regions
from eye fixation datasets, resize them to low resolution and feed them into a
hierarchical. With layer-wise unsupervised feature learning, we find that many
proto-objects like features responsive to different shapes of object blobs are
learned out. Visualizations also show that these features are selective to
potential objects in the scene and the responses of these features work well in
predicting eye fixations on the images when combined with learned weights.

spectra in the red region newly obtained at Okayama Astrophysical Observatory.
Our main purpose was to clarify whether any significantly large (<~0.4-0.5 dex)
O-deficit really exists in these evolved stars, which was once suspected by
Takeda et al. (2008, PASJ, 60, 781) from the analysis of the [O I] 5577 line,
since it (if real) is inexlainable by the current theory and may require the
necessity of special non-canonical deep mixing in the envelope. We found,
however, that the previous [O/H]_5577 results (differential abundances relative
to the sun) were systematically underestimated compared to the more reliable
[O/H]_7773 (from O I 7771-5 triplet lines) or [O/H]_6300 (from [O I] 6300 line)
obtained in this study. Comparing the updated [O/Fe] ratios with the
theoretically predicted surface abundance changes caused by mixing of
nuclear-processed products dredged-up from the interior, we concluded that the
oxygen deficiency in these red giants is insignificantly marginal (only by
<~0.1 dex), which does not contradict the expectation from the recent
theoretical simulation. This consequence of reasonable consistency between
theory and observation also applies to the extent of peculiarity in [C/Fe] and

be an important channel to form binary millisecond pulsars (MSPs). Recent
investigations on thermal timescale mass transfer in WD binaries demonstrate
that the resultant MSPs are likely to have relatively wide orbit periods
($\gtrsim 10$ days). Here we calculate the evolution of WD binaries taking into
account the excited wind from the companion star induced by X-ray irradiation
of the accreting WD, which may drive rapid mass transfer even when the
companion star is less massive than the WD. This scenario can naturally explain
the formation of the strong-field neutron star in the low-mass X-ray binary 4U
1822$-$37. After AIC the mass transfer resumes when the companion star refills
its Roche lobe, and the neutron star is recycled due to mass accretion. A large
fraction of the binaries will evolve to become binary MSPs with a He WD
companion, with the orbital periods distributed between $\gtrsim 0.1$ day and
$\lesssim 30$ days, while some of them may follow the cataclysmic variable-like
evolution towards very short orbits. If we instead assume that the newborn
neutron star appears as an MSP and part of its rotational energy is used to
ablate its companion star, the binaries may also evolve to be the redback-like
systems.

power constraints of users might prevent them from transmitting their bid

must travel through a noisy channel. These schemes also have very high
overheads which cannot be accommodated in wireless standards. We propose
auction schemes where a central clearing authority auctions spectrum to users
who bid for it, while taking into account quantization of prices, overheads in
bid revelation, and noise in the channel explicitly. Our schemes are closely
related to channel output feedback problems and, specifically, to the technique
of posterior matching. We consider several scenarios where the objective of the
clearing authority is to award spectrum to the bidders who value spectrum the
most. We prove theoretically that this objective is asymptotically attained by
our scheme when the bidders are non-strategic with constant bids. We propose
separate schemes to make strategic users reveal their private values
truthfully, to auction multiple sub-channels among strategic users, and to
track slowly time-varying bid prices. Our simulations illustrate the optimality
of our schemes for constant bid prices, and also demonstrate the effectiveness

a yearlong period in Shanghai, China. We find a series of latent structures,
called urban spatial-temporal activity structure (USTAS). While interpreting
these structures, a series of outstanding underlying associations between the
spatial and temporal activity patterns can be found. Moreover, we can not only
reproduce the observed data with a lower dimensional representative but also
simultaneously project both the spatial and temporal activity patterns in the
same coordinate system. By utilizing the K-means clustering algorithm, five
significant types of clusters which are directly annotated with a corresponding
combination of temporal activities can be obtained. This provides a clear
picture of how the groups of regions are associated with different activities
at different time of day. Besides the commercial and transportation dominant
area, we also detect two kinds of residential areas, the developed residential
areas and the developing residential areas. We further verify the spatial
distribution of these clusters in the view of urban form analysis. The results
shows a high consistency with the government planning from the same periods,

quite well by applying third-body and spot effects to the system. The results

K, in which the detached primary component fills about 77\% of its limiting
lobe. Striking discrepancies exist between the primary and secondary eclipse
times obtained with the method of Kwee \& van Woerden. These are mainly caused
by surface inhomogeneities due to spot activity detected in our light-curve
synthesis. The 1,253 light-curve timings from the Wilson-Devinney code were
used for a period study. It was found that the orbital period of KIC 5621294
has varied due to a periodic variation overlaid on a downward parabola. The
sinusoidal variation with a period of 961 d and a semi-amplitude of 22.5 s most
likely arise from a light-time effect due to a third component with a mass of
$M_3 \sin i_3$=46.9 M$\rm_{Jup}$, which is in good agreement with that
calculated from the light curve itself. If its orbital inclination is larger
than about 40$^\circ$, the mass of the circumbinary object would possibly match
a brown dwarf. The parabolic variation could not be fully explained by either a
mass transfer between the binary components or an angular momentum via magnetic
braking. It is possible that the parabola may only be the observed part of a
period modulation caused by the presence of another companion in a wider orbit.

from unlabeled data using a single-layer K-means network. A K-means network
maps the input data into a feature representation by finding the nearest
centroid for each input point, which has attracted researchers' great attention
recently due to its simplicity, effectiveness, and scalability. However, one
drawback of this feature mapping is that it tends to be unreliable when the
training data contains noise. To address this issue, we propose a SVDD based
feature learning algorithm that describes the density and distribution of each
cluster from K-means with an SVDD ball for more robust feature representation.
For this purpose, we present a new SVDD algorithm called C-SVDD that centers
the SVDD ball towards the mode of local density of each cluster, and we show
that the objective of C-SVDD can be solved very efficiently as a linear
programming problem. Additionally, traditional unsupervised feature learning
methods usually take an average or sum of local representations to obtain
global representation which ignore spatial relationship among them. To use
spatial information we propose a global representation with a variant of SIFT
descriptor. The architecture is also extended with multiple receptive field
scales and multiple pooling sizes. Extensive experiments on several popular
object recognition benchmarks, such as STL-10, MINST, Holiday and Copydays
shows that the proposed C-SVDDNet method yields comparable or better
performance than that of the previous state of the art methods.

problem of recovering sparse representations for noisy data points in a
dictionary whose columns correspond to corrupted data lying close to a union of
subspaces. We consider a constrained $\ell_1$-minimization and study conditions
under which the solution of the proposed optimization satisfies the approximate
subspace-sparse recovery condition. More specifically, we show that each noisy
data point, perturbed from a subspace by a noise of the magnitude of
$\varepsilon$, will be reconstructed using data points from the same subspace
with a small error of the order of $O(\varepsilon)$ and that the coefficients
corresponding to data points in other subspaces will be sufficiently small,
\ie, of the order of $O(\varepsilon)$. We do not impose any randomness
assumption on the arrangement of subspaces or distribution of data points in
each subspace. Our framework is based on a novel generalization of the
null-space property to the setting where data lie in multiple subspaces, the
number of data points in each subspace exceeds the dimension of the subspace,
and all data points are corrupted by noise. Moreover, assuming a random
distribution for data points, we further show that coefficients from the
desired support not only reconstruct a given point with high accuracy, but also
have sufficiently large values, \ie, of the order of $O(1)$.

occupying $k$ adjacent sites) on a square lattice is studied by means of Monte
Carlo simulation. The $k$-mers are deposited using a random sequential
adsorption mechanism. Two models, $L_d$ and $K_d$, are analyzed. In the $L_d$
model, it is assumed that the initial square lattice is non-ideal and some
fraction of sites, $d$, is occupied by non-conducting point defects
(impurities). In the $K_d$ model, the initial square lattice is perfect.
However, it is assumed that some fraction of the sites in the $k$-mers, $d$,
consists of defects, i.e., are non-conducting. The length of the $k$-mers, $k$,
varies from 2 to 256. Periodic boundary conditions are applied to the square
lattice. The dependencies of the percolation threshold concentration of the
conducting sites, $p_c$, vs the concentration of defects, $d$, were analyzed
for different values of $k$. Above some critical concentration of defects,
$d_m$, percolation is blocked in both models, even at the jamming concentration
of $k$-mers. For long $k$-mers, the values of $d_m$ are well fitted by the
functions $d_m \propto k_m^{-\alpha}-k^{-\alpha}$ ($\alpha = 1.28 \pm 0.01$,
$k_m = 5900 \pm 500$) and $d_m \propto \log (k_m/k)$ ($k_m = 4700 \pm 1000$ ),
for the $L_d$ and $K_d$ models, respectively. Thus, our estimation indicates
that the percolation of $k$-mers on a square lattice is impossible even for a
lattice without any defects if $k\gtrapprox 6 \times 10^3$.

the LRTAP. It consists of three major stages: i) Find a set of linear relations
that are approximately satisfied by the tensor; such linear relations can be
expressed by polynomials and can be found by solving linear least squares. ii)
Compute a set of points that are approximately common zeros of the obtained

contemporary generative models are usually point-wise deterministic mappings

class-specific transformations, statistically driven models trained on them
would not be able to generalize when the labeled data is scarce. Inspired by
the stochasticity of the synaptic connections in the brain, we introduce
Energy-based Stochastic Ensembles. These ensembles can learn non-deterministic
representations, i.e., mappings from the feature space to a family of
distributions in the latent space. These mappings are encoded in a distribution
over a (possibly infinite) collection of models. By conditionally sampling
models from the ensemble, we obtain multiple representations for every input

contrastive divergence for training restricted Boltzmann stochastic ensembles.

with analogue properties to those of a black hole event horizon. In particular,
a draining bathtub-like model can give rise to a rotating acoustic horizon and
hence a rotating black hole (acoustic) analogue. We show that sound waves, when
enclosed in a cylindrical cavity, can form stationary waves around such
rotating acoustic black holes. These acoustic perturbations display similar
properties to the scalar clouds that have been studied around Kerr and
Kerr-Newman black holes; thus they are dubbed acoustic clouds. We make the
comparison between scalar clouds around Kerr black holes and acoustic clouds
around the draining bathtub explicit by studying also the properties of scalar
clouds around Kerr black holes enclosed in a cavity. Acoustic clouds suggest
the possibility of testing, experimentally, the existence and properties of
black hole clouds, using analog models.

emissions and attempt to understand whether cancer in children is typically
located together with some specific chemical combinations or is independent.
Co-location pattern analysis seems to be the appropriate investigation to
perform. Co-location mining is one of the tasks of spatial data mining which
focuses on the detection of co-location patterns, the sets of spatial features
frequently located in close proximity of each other. Most previous works are
based on transaction-free apriori-like algorithms which are dependent on
user-defined thresholds and are designed for boolean data points. Due to the
absence of a clear notion of transactions, it is nontrivial to use association
rule mining techniques to tackle the co-location mining problem. The approach
we propose is based on a grid ""transactionization"" of the geographic space and
is designed to mine datasets with extended spatial objects. Uncertainty of the
feature presence in transactions is taken into account in our model. The
statistical test is used instead of global thresholds to detect significant
co-location patterns and rules. We evaluate our approach on synthetic and real
datasets. This approach can be used by researchers looking for spatial
associations between environmental and health factors. In addition, we explain
the data modelling framework which is used on real datasets of pollutants
(PRTR/NPRI) and childhood cancer cases.

conventional photoacoustic simulation model. More interestingly, the

one would choose the parameters of that function so that the degree of its

algebraic point of view, we consider the question of how to lift a stable
equivalence of Morita type between arbitrary finite dimensional algebras to a
derived equivalence. In this paper, we present a machinery to solve this
question for a class of stable equivalences of Morita type. In particular, we
show that every stable equivalence of Morita type between Frobenius-finite
algebras over an algebraically closed field can be lifted to a derived
equivalence. %Thus Frobenius-finite algebras share many common %invariants of
both derived equivalences and stable equivalences. Especially, Auslander-Reiten
conjecrure is true for stable equivalences of Morita type between
Frobenius-finite algebras without semisimple direct summands. Examples of such
a class of algebras are abundant, including Auslander algebras, cluster-tilted
algebras and certain Frobenius extensions. As a byproduct of our methods, we
further show that, for a Nakayama-stable idempotent element $e$ in an algebra
$A$ over an arbitrary field, each tilting complex over $eAe$ can be extended to
a tilting complex over $A$ that induces an almost $\nu$-stable derived
equivalence studied in the first paper of this series. Moreover, we demonstrate
that our techniques are applicable to verify the Brou\'{e}'s abelian defect
group conjecture for several cases mentioned by Okuyama.

with $\alpha$ and Li ions generating a hot spot on the current-biased Nb strip
which in turn induces a superconducting-normal state transition. The latter is
recognized as a voltage signal which is the evidence of the incident neutron.
The above described detection principle has been experimentally assessed and
verified by irradiating the samples with a pulsed neutron beam at the ISIS
spallation neutron source (UK). It is found that the boron coated
superconducting strips, kept at a temperature T = 8 K and current-biased below
the critical current Ic, are driven into the normal state upon thermal neutron
irradiation. As a result of the transition, voltage pulses in excess of 40 mV
are measured while the bias current can be properly modulated to bring the
strip back to the superconducting state, thus resetting the detector.
Measurements on the counting rate of the device are presented and the future
perspectives leading to neutron detectors with unprecedented spatial
resolutions and efficiency are highlighted.

distances of 90 Mpc/h. These have been randomly extended up to volumes
enclosing 360 Mpc/h with augmented Lagrangian perturbation theory (750
simulations in total), accounting in this way for gravitational mode coupling
from larger scales, correcting for periodic boundary effects, and estimating
systematics of missing attractors ($\sigma_{\rm large}=134$ km/s). We report on
Local Group speed reconstructions, which are compatible with CMB-dipole
measurements: $|v_{\rm LG}|=685\pm137$ km/s. The direction $(l,b)=(260.5\pm
13.3,39.1\pm 10.4)^\circ$ is compatible with observations after considering the
variance of large scales. Accounting for large scales, our local bulk flow
estimations assuming a $\Lambda$CDM model are compatible with estimates based
on velocity data derived from the Tully-Fisher relation.
  We focus on low redshift supernova measurements ($0.01<z<0.025$), which have
been found to disagree with probes at larger distances. Our analysis indicates
that there are two effects contributing to this tension. First, the anisotropic
distribution of supernovae aligns with the velocity dipole and induces a
systematic boost in $H_0$. Second, a divergent region surrounding the Virgo
Supercluster is responsible for an additional positive bias in $H_0$. Taking
these effects into account yields a correction of $\Delta H_0=-1.76 \pm 0.21 $
km/s/Mpc, thereby reducing the tension between local probes and more distant
probes. Effectively $H_0$ is lower by about $2\%$.

produced at the LHC through cascade decays of colored superparticles, in

challenge, both in astrophysical plasmas such as the Sun's corona and in

relaxation with braided magnetic fields identified the possibility of a novel
constraint, arising from the topological degree of the magnetic field-line
mapping. This constraint implies that the final relaxed state is drastically
different for an initial configuration with topological degree 1 (which allows
a Taylor relaxation) and one with degree 2 (which does not reach a Taylor
state). Here we test this transition in numerical resistive-magnetohydrodynamic
simulations, by embedding a braided magnetic field in a linear force-free
background. Varying the background force-free field parameter generates a
sequence of initial conditions with a transition between topological degree 1
and 2. For degree 1, the relaxation produces a single twisted flux tube, while
for degree 2 we obtain two flux tubes. For predicting the exact point of
transition, it is not the topological degree of the whole domain that is
relevant, but only that of the turbulent region.

an asymptotic model, based on the long-range properties of the scattering
[Crubellier et al. arXiv:1412.0569]. Remarkably, the properties of the
field-dressed shape resonances in this asymptotic multi-channel description are
found to be approximately linear in the field intensity up to fairly large

sufficient to study the control of such resonances by the non-resonant field.
The multi-channel results furthermore indicate the dependence on field
intensity to present, at least approximately, universal characteristics. Here
we combine the nodal line technique to solve the asymptotic Schr\""odinger

features of realistic interatomic potentials - hard repulsive core, quasilinear
behavior in a ground state and possibility of dissociation. It has become clear
recently, that this latter feature has crucial effect on convergence of the
heat conduction coefficient in thermodynamic limit. We demonstrate that in
one-dimensional chain of elastic particles with hard core the heat conduction
coefficient also converges, as one could expect. Then we explore effect of
dimensionality on the heat transport in this model. For this sake, longitudinal
and transversal motions of the particles are allowed in a long narrow channel.
With varying width of the channel, we observe sharp transition from
""one-dimensional"" to ""two-dimensional"" behavior. Namely, the heat conduction
coefficient drops by about order of magnitude for relatively small widening of
the channel. This transition is not unique for the considered system. Similar
phenomenon of transition to quasi-1D behavior with growth of aspect ratio of
the channel is observed also in a gas of densely packed hard (billiard)
particles, both for two- and three-dimensional cases. It is the case despite
the fact that the character of transition in these two systems is not similar,
due to different convergence properties of the heat conductivity. In the
billiard model, the divergence of the heat conduction coefficient smoothly
changes from logarithmic to power-like law with increase of the length.

random motions. This property becomes a serious obstacle if one attempts to
model conditions under which a particular L\'evy process may be subject to
physically implementable manipulations, whose ultimate goal is to confine the
random motion in a spatially finite, possibly mesoscopic trap. We analyze
thisissue for an exemplary case of the Cauchy process in a finiteinterval.
Qualitatively, our observations extend to general jump-type processes that are
driven by non-gaussian noises, classified by the integral part of the
L\'evy-Khintchine formula.For clarity of arguments we discuss, as a reference
model, the classic case of the Brownian motion in the interval.

consists of all equivalent classes of curves that agree up to their
accelerations of order $k$. In the previous work of the author he proved that
$T^kM$, $1\leq k\leq \infty$, admits a vector bundle structure on $M$ if and
only if $M $ is endowed with a linear connection or equivalently a connection
map on $T^kM$ is defined. This bundle structure depends heavily on the choice
of the connection. In this paper we ask about the extent to which this vector
bundle structure remains isomorphic. To this end we define the notion of the
$k$'th order differential $T^kg:T^kM\longrightarrow T^kN$ for a given
differentiable map $g$ between manifolds $M$ and $N$. As we shall see, $T^kg$
becomes a vector bundle morphism if the base manifolds are endowed with
$g$-related connections. In particular, replacing a connection with a
$g$-related one, where $g:M\longrightarrow M$ is a diffeomorphism, follows
invariant vector bundle structures. Finally, using immersions on Hilbert
manifolds, convex combination of connection maps and manifold of $C^r$ maps we
offer three examples to support our theory and reveal its interaction with the
known problems such as Sasaki lift of metrics.

are studied both in a magnetic field applied perpendicular to the CuO2 planes,
and in zero field under different cooling conditions. We find that the effect
of the magnetic field is to increase the magnetic scattering signal at all
values of the out-of-plane wave vector L, indicating an overall increase of the
magnetic moments. In addition, weak correlations between the copper oxide
planes develop in the presence of a magnetic field. This effect is not taken
into account in previous reports on the field effect of magnetic scattering,
since usually only L~0 is probed. Interestingly, the results of quench-cooling
the sample are similar to those obtained by applying a magnetic field. Finally,
a small variation of the incommensurate peak position as a function of L
provides evidence that the incommensurate signal is twinned with the dominating
and sub-dominant twin displaying peaks at even or odd L, respectively.

$q$ across communities. One observes a realization of this random graph, and
the objective is to reconstruct the communities from this observation. We show
that under spectral algorithms, the number of misclassified vertices does not

is defined dually and $S$ is coherent if it is both right and left coherent.
These notions are analogous to those for a ring $R$ (where, of course, $S$-acts
are replaced by $R$-modules). Choo, Lam and Luft have shown that free rings are
coherent. In this note we prove that, correspondingly, any free monoid is
coherent, thus answering a question posed by the first author in 1992.

microns and from large dust grains at 160 and 250 microns in the nearby spiral
galaxies NGC 2403 and M83 using data from the Spitzer Space Telescope and

correlated with emission at 250 microns from dust heated by the diffuse
interstellar radiation field (ISRF) and that the 8/250 micron surface
brightness ratio is well-correlated with the stellar surface brightness as
measured at 3.6 microns. This implies that the PAHs in NGC 2403 are intermixed
with cold large dust grains in the diffuse interstellar medium (ISM) and that
the PAHs are excited by the diffuse ISRF. In M83, the PAH emission appears more
strongly correlated with 160 micron emission originating from large dust grains
heated by star forming regions. However, the PAH emission in M83 is low where
the 24 micron emission peaks within star forming regions, and enhancements in
the 8/160 micron surface brightness ratios appear offset relative to the dust
and the star forming regions within the spiral arms. This suggests that the
PAHs observed in the 8 micron band are not excited locally within star forming
regions but either by light escaping non-axisymmetrically from star forming
regions or locally by young, non-photoionising stars that have migrated
downstream from the spiral density waves. The results from just these two
galaxies show that PAHs may be excited by different stellar populations in
different spiral galaxies.

assume that the machines, apart from receiving service from the repairman, also
serve queues of products. The extended model can be viewed as a layered
queueing network, where the first layer consists of the queues of products and
the second layer is the ordinary machine-repair model. Since the repair time of
one machine may affect the time the other machine is not able to process
products, the downtimes of the machines are correlated. This correlation leads
to dependence between the queues of products in the first layer. Analysis of
these queue length distributions is hard, since the exact dependence structure
for the downtimes, or the queue lengths, is not known. Therefore, we obtain an
approximation for the complete marginal queue length distribution of any queue
in the first layer, by viewing such a queue as a single server queue with
correlated server downtimes. Under an explicit assumption on the form of the
downtime dependence, we obtain exact results for the queue length distribution
for that single server queue. We use these exact results to approximate the
machine-repair model. We do so by computing the downtime correlation for the
latter model and by subsequently using this information to fine-tune the
parameters we introduced to the single server queue. As a result, we
immediately obtain an approximation for the queue length distributions of
products in the machine-repair model, which we show to be highly accurate by
extensive numerical experiments.

the other part in a state which would be difficult or impossible to achieve
otherwise, in particular one sensitive to small effects in the `collapse'
interaction.
  We present some applications to the very symmeteric and experimentally
accessible situations of the decays $\phi(1020)\to K^oK^o$, $\psi(3770)\to
D^oD^o$, or $\Upsilon(4s)\to B^oB^o$, involving the internal state of the
two-state $K^o$, $D^o$ or $B^o$ mesons. The ""collapse of the wavefunction""
occasioned by a decay of one member of the pair (`away side') fixes the state
vector of that side's two-state system. Bose-Einstein statistics then
determines the state of the recoiling meson (`near side'), whose evolution can
then be followed further.
  In particular the statistics requirement dictates that the `away side' and
`near side' internal states must be orthogonal at the time of the ""collapse"".
Thus a CP violation in the `away side', decay implies a complementary CP
impurity on the `near side', which can be detected in the further evolution.
The CP violaion so manifested is necessarily direct CP violation, since neither
the mass matrix nor time evolution was involved in the ""collapse"".
  A parametrization of the direct CP violation is given and various
manifestations are presented. Certain rates or combination of rates are
identified which are nonzero only if there is direct CP violation.
  The very explicit and detailed use made of ""collapse of the wavefunction""
makes the procedure interesting with respect to the fundamentals of quantum
mechanics. We note an experimental consistency test for our treatment of the
""collapse of the wavefunction"", which can be carried out by a certain
measurement of partial decay rates.

and distributed systems scale to millions of processing cores and wide area
networks. Traditional methods for dealing with faults include
checkpoint-restart, active replicas, and deterministic replay. Each of these
techniques has associated resource overheads and constraints. In this paper, we
propose an alternate approach to dealing with faults, based on input
augmentation. This approach, which is an algorithmic analog of erasure coded
storage, applies a minimally modified algorithm on the augmented input to
produce an augmented output. The execution of such an algorithm proceeds
completely oblivious to faults in the system. In the event of one or more
faults, the real solution is recovered using a rapid reconstruction method from
the augmented output. We demonstrate this approach on the problem of solving
sparse linear systems using a conjugate gradient solver. We present input
augmentation and output recovery techniques. Through detailed experiments, we
show that our approach can be made oblivious to a large number of faults with
low computational overhead. Specifically, we demonstrate cases where a single
fault can be corrected with less than 10% overhead in time, and even in extreme
cases (fault rates of 20%), our approach is able to compute a solution with
reasonable overhead. These results represent a significant improvement over the
state of the art.

been proposed by Stoneham et al. In this photo-induced radical pair (RP) model
the signal transduction mechanism was physical rather than chemical in nature,
as otherwise generally assumed in the literature. The proposal contains a
magnetosensor and a signal transduction mechanism. The sensor would be an
electric dipole related to a long lived triplet state of an RP. This makes it
sensitive to the geomagnetic field via the Zeeman interaction. The field of the
electric dipole moment would then promote isomerization from cis-to-trans in
the retinal of a nearby rhodopsin. This would trigger the neuronal signal. Here
we gather several observations from different works that constrain the
feasibility of this physical model. In particular we argue that the
perturbation of rhodopsin by a local electric field from a nearby electric
dipole (10^6 V/m) cannot modify the field in the binding pocket of rhodopsin
(10^9 V/m) sufficiently to trigger the isomerization of cis-retinal. The dipole
field is much weaker than those from other sources in the vicinity which are
known not to promote isomerization.

intervals of time between events, $\tau_{1},\tau_{2},...$, are independent and
identically distributed (i.i.d.) random variables with a common density
$\rho(\tau)$. Fixing the total observation time to $t$ induces a global
constraint on the sum of these random intervals, which accordingly become
interdependent. Here we focus on the largest interval among such a sequence on
the fixed time interval $(0,t)$. Depending on how the last interval is treated,
we consider three different situations, indexed by $\alpha=$ I, II and III. We
investigate the distribution of the longest interval $\ell^\alpha_{\max}(t)$
and the probability $Q^\alpha(t)$ that the last interval is the longest one. We
show that if $\rho(\tau)$ decays faster than $1/\tau^2$ for large $\tau$, then
the full statistics of $\ell^\alpha_{\max}(t)$ is given, in the large $t$
limit, by the standard theory of extreme value statistics for i.i.d. random
variables, showing in particular that the global constraint on the intervals
$\tau_i$ does not play any role at large times in this case. However, if
$\rho(\tau)$ exhibits heavy tails, $\rho(\tau)\sim\tau^{-1-\theta}$ for large
$\tau$, with index $0 <\theta<1$, we show that the fluctuations of
$\ell^\alpha_{\max}(t)/t$ are governed, in the large $t$ limit, by a stationary
universal distribution which depends on both $\theta$ and $\alpha$, which we
compute exactly. On the other hand, $Q^{\alpha}(t)$ is generically different
from its counterpart for i.i.d. variables (both for narrow or heavy tailed
distributions $\rho(\tau)$). In particular, in the case $0<\theta<1$, the large

$e_T^\perp H_1^\perp$ term in the $\cos(2\phi_h -\phi_S)$ asymmetry. We
calculate the four twist-3 distributions $g_T(x,\boldsymbol{k}_T^2)$,
$g_T^\perp(x,\boldsymbol{k}_T^2)$, $e_T(x,\boldsymbol{k}_T^2)$, and
$e_T^\perp(x,\boldsymbol{k}_T^2)$ in a spectator-diquark model including vector
diquarks. Then we predict the two corresponding asymmetries for charged and
neutral pions at the kinematics of HERMES, JLab, and COMPASS for the first
time. The numerical estimates indicate that the two different
angular-dependence asymmetries are sizable by several percent at HERMES and
JLab, and the $\cos\phi_S$ asymmetry has a strong dependence on the Bjorken
$x$. Our predictions also show that the dominant contribution to the
$\cos\phi_S$ asymmetry comes from the $g_T D_1$ term, while the $g_T^\perp D_1$
term gives the main contribution to the $\cos(2\phi_h -\phi_S)$ asymmetry; the
other two $T$-odd terms almost give negligible contributions. In particular,
the $\cos(2\phi_h -\phi_S)$ asymmetry provides a unique opportunity to probe
the distribution $g_T^\perp$.

importance in statistics since it is often the key ingredient for constructing
estimators, test procedures or confidence intervals. In many situations, the
exact sampling from a given distribution is impossible or computationally
expensive and, therefore, one needs to resort to approximate sampling
strategies. However, there is no well-developed theory providing meaningful
nonasymptotic guarantees for the approximate sampling procedures, especially in
the high-dimensional problems. This paper makes some progress in this direction
by considering the problem of sampling from a distribution having a smooth and
log-concave density defined on \(\RR^p\), for some integer \(p>0\). We
establish nonasymptotic bounds for the error of approximating the target
distribution by the one obtained by the Langevin Monte Carlo method and its
variants. We illustrate the effectiveness of the established guarantees with
various experiments. Underlying our analysis are insights from the theory of
continuous-time diffusion processes, which may be of interest beyond the
framework of log-concave densities considered in the present work.

then analyze two different scenarios, first in which quantum player makes
unitary transformations to his qubit while the classical player uses a pure

number of areas of mathematics and applications.
  If two sets are homometric but do not coincide up to translations and point
reflections, we call them nontrivially homometric. We study nontrivially
homometric pairs of lattice-convex sets, where a set $K$ is called
lattice-convex with respect to a lattice $\mathbb{M} \subseteq \mathbb{R}^d$ if
$K$ is the intersection of $\mathbb{M}$ and a convex subset of $\mathbb{R}^d$.
This line of research was initiated in 2005 by Daurat, G\'erard and Nivat and,
independently, by Gardner, Gronchi and Zong.
  All pairs of nontrivially homometric lattice-convex sets that have been known
so far can essentially be written as direct sums $S \oplus T$ and $S \oplus
(-T)$, where $T$ is lattice-convex, the underlying lattice~$\mathbb{M}$ is the
direct sum of $T$ and some sublattice $\mathbb{L}$, and $S$ is a subset of
$\mathbb{L}$. We study pairs of nontrivially homometric lattice-convex sets
assuming this particular form and establish a necessary and a sufficient
condition for the lattice-convexity of $S \oplus T$. This allows us to
explicitly describe all nontrivially homometric pairs in dimension two, under

radiation is a purely relativistic phenomenon, and so the connection with the

expression to compute influx on root surface and a generalized formula to
estimate the cumulative nutrient uptake are used. The moving boundary model
problem is solved by the adaptive finite element method. For comparison of
simulations of influx and cumulative uptake versus observed results six set of
data extracted from literature are used. For ions without limitations of
availability fixed and moving boundary models produces similar results with
small errors. Instead, to low concentrations, the fixed boundary model over
predicts while the moving boundary model always produces better results mainly
for K. For the P uptake the moving boundary model produces better results only
when the concentrations are very low and their predictions are comparable to
the obtained by a 3D-architectural model. The obtained improvements would
explain any failures of previous models for ions of low availability.

without human discomfort, is really a speedily growing on the computer research
field. There are many applications and programs uses facial expression to
evaluate human character, judgment, feelings, and viewpoint. The process of
recognizing facial expression is a hard task due to the several circumstances
such as facial occlusions, face shape, illumination, face colors, and etc. This
paper present a PCA methodology to distinguish expressions of faces under
different circumstances and identifying it. Relies on Eigen faces technique
using standard Data base images. So as to overcome the problem of difficulty to
computers to identify the features and expressions of persons.
