indeterminate string. An indeterminate string may contain non-solid symbols,
each of which specifies a subset of the alphabet that could be present at the
corresponding position. We also consider covering partial words, which are a
special case of indeterminate strings where each non-solid symbol is a don't
care symbol. We prove that indeterminate string covering problem and partial
word covering problem are NP-complete for binary alphabet and show that both
problems are fixed-parameter tractable with respect to $k$, the number of
non-solid symbols. For the indeterminate string covering problem we obtain a
$2^{O(k \log k)} + n k^{O(1)}$-time algorithm. For the partial word covering
problem we obtain a $2^{O(\sqrt{k}\log k)} + nk^{O(1)}$-time algorithm. We
prove that, unless the Exponential Time Hypothesis is false, no
$2^{o(\sqrt{k})} n^{O(1)}$-time solution exists for either problem, which shows
that our algorithm for this case is close to optimal. We also present an
algorithm for both problems which is feasible in practice.

1050 m from the two reactor cores of the Chooz nuclear power plant has
accumulated a live time of 467.90 days, corresponding to an exposure of 66.5
GW-ton-year (reactor power $\times$ detector mass $\times$ live time). A
revised analysis has boosted the signal efficiency and reduced the backgrounds
and systematic uncertainties compared to previous publications, paving the way
for the two detector phase. The measured $\sin^2 2\theta_{13} =
0.090^{+0.032}_{-0.029}$ is extracted from a fit to the energy spectrum. A
deviation from the prediction above a visible energy of 4 MeV is found, being
consistent with an unaccounted reactor flux effect, which does not affect the
$\theta_{13}$ result. A consistent value of $\theta_{13}$ is measured in a
rate-only fit to the number of observed candidates as a function of the reactor

to give the constraint $\gamma (\sigma_8/0.83)^{6.7} = 0.55 \pm 0.1$. We also

$U$, ubiquitous in typical quantum dot systems, the relevant transport physics

thermoelectric pure spin currents at various Coulomb interaction parameters $U$

transport between energy levels $\epsilon$ and their Coulomb-charged partner
levels $\epsilon+U$, so as to yield the largest terminal pure spin currents. A
non-trivial aspect pointed out here is that at sufficiently large values of $U$
($\ge U_0$), pure spin currents tend to optimize at points other than where the
particle-hole symmetry occurs. It is also ascertained that a global maximum of
pure spin current is generated at a typical value of the interaction parameter
$U$. These optimum conditions may be easily realized using a typical gated

this paper, we develop an active search strategy that sequentially chooses the
next window to evaluate based on all the information gathered before. This
results in a substantial reduction in the number of classifier evaluations and
in a more elegant approach in general. Our search strategy is guided by two
forces. First, we exploit context as the statistical relation between the
appearance of a window and its location relative to the object, as observed in
the training set. This enables to jump across distant regions in the image
(e.g. observing a sky region suggests that cars might be far below) and is done
efficiently in a Random Forest framework. Second, we exploit the score of the
classifier to attract the search to promising areas surrounding a highly scored
window, and to keep away from areas near low scored ones. Our search strategy
can be applied on top of any classifier as it treats it as a black-box. In
experiments with R-CNN on the challenging SUN2012 dataset, our method matches
the detection accuracy of evaluating all windows independently, while
evaluating 9x fewer windows.

four break frequencies. Scaringi et al. (2012) analysed high-cadence Kepler
data of MV Lyr, taken almost continuously over 600 days, giving the unique
opportunity to study multicomponent Power Density Spectra (PDS) over a wide
frequency range. We modelled this variability with our statistical model based
on disc angular momentum transport via discrete turbulent bodies with an
exponential distribution of the dimension scale. Two different models were
used, a full disc (developed from the white dwarf to the outer radius of ~10^10
cm) and a radially thin disc (a ring at a distance of ~10^10 cm from the white
dwarf) that imitates an outer disc rim. We succeed in explaining the two lowest
observed break frequencies assuming typical values for a disc radius of 0.5 and
0.9 times the primary Roche lobe and an alpha parameter of 0.1-0.4. The highest
observed break frequency was also modelled, but with a rather small accretion
disc with radius of 0.3 times the primary Roche lobe and a high alpha value of
0.9 consistent with previous findings by Scaringi (2014). Furthermore, the
simulated light curves exhibit the typical linear rms-flux proportionality
linear relation and the typical log-normal flux distribution. As the turbulent
process is generating fluctuations in mass accretion that propagate through the
disc, this confirms the general knowledge that the typical rms-flux relation is
mainly generated by these fluctuations. In general a higher rms is generated by
a larger amount of superposed flares which is compatible with a higher mass
accretion rate expressed by a larger flux.

  Maximum Weight Constrained Spanning Tree
  We present a randomized algorithm for the problem of weight upgradeable
budget constrained maximum spanning tree on a general graph. This returns a
spanning tree $\mathcal{T}^{'}$ which is feasible within the budget $B$, such
that $\Pr [ l(\mathcal{T}^{'}) \geq (1-\epsilon)\text{OPT}\text{ , }
c(\mathcal{T}^{'} ) \leq B] \ge 1-\frac{1}{n}$ (where $l$ and $c$ denote the
length and cost of the tree respectively), for any fixed $\epsilon >0$, in time
polynomial in $|V|=n$, $|E|=m$. Our results extend to the minimization version
also. Previously Krumke et. al. \cite{krumke} presented a$(1+\frac{1}{\gamma},
1+ \gamma)$ bicriteria approximation algorithm for any fixed $\gamma >0$ for
this problem in general graphs for a more general cost upgrade function. The
result in this paper improves their 0/1 cost upgrade model.

Additionally, the Li distribution inside the $\theta^{'}$ platelets was found
to equal the same value as in the matrix. The equally thin $T_{1}$ platelet
deviates from the formula ($Al_{2}Li Cu$) in its stoichiometry and shows Mg
enrichment inside the platelet without any indication of a higher segregation

computational scalability and of statistical efficiency. The main result of
this paper shows that our method performs change-point estimation reliably as
long as the product of the smallest-sized change (the Euclidean-norm-squared of
the difference between signals at a change-point) and the smallest distance
between change-points (number of time instances) is larger than a Gaussian

the so-called integrated fluxes, which are defined as the integral of the

to Wilson surface operators. These integrated flux observables will play an
important role in the coarse graining of states in loop quantum gravity, and
can be used to encode in this context the notion of curvature-induced torsion.
We furthermore define a continuum phase space as the modified projective limit
of a family of discrete phase spaces based on triangulations. This continuum
phase space yields a continuum (holonomy-flux) algebra of observables. We show
that the corresponding Poisson algebra is closed by computing the Poisson
brackets between the integrated fluxes, which have the novel property of being
allowed to intersect each other.

  Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining",,,,"stat.ML cs.CY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  What does it mean for an algorithm to be biased? In U.S. law, unintentional
bias is encoded via disparate impact, which occurs when a selection process has
widely different outcomes for different groups, even as it appears to be
neutral. This legal determination hinges on a definition of a protected class
(ethnicity, gender, religious practice) and an explicit description of the
process.
  When the process is implemented using computers, determining disparate impact
(and hence bias) is harder. It might not be possible to disclose the process.
In addition, even if the process is open, it might be hard to elucidate in a
legal setting how the algorithm makes its decisions. Instead of requiring
access to the algorithm, we propose making inferences based on the data the
algorithm uses.
  We make four contributions to this problem. First, we link the legal notion
of disparate impact to a measure of classification accuracy that while known,
has received relatively little attention. Second, we propose a test for
disparate impact based on analyzing the information leakage of the protected
class from the other data attributes. Third, we describe methods by which data
might be made unbiased. Finally, we present empirical evidence supporting the
effectiveness of our test for disparate impact and our approach for both
masking bias and preserving relevant information in the data. Interestingly,
our approach resembles some actual selection practices that have recently
received legal scrutiny.

non-SUSY models which entails a linear coupling of the inflaton to gravity.
Imposing a lower bound on the parameter cR, involved in the coupling between
the inflaton and the Ricci scalar curvature, inflation can be attained even for
subplanckian values of the inflaton while the corresponding effective theory
respects the perturbative unitarity up to the Planck scale. Working in the
non-SUSY context we also consider radiative corrections to the inflationary
potential due to a possible coupling of the inflaton to bosons or fermions. We
find ranges of the parameters, depending mildly on the renormalization scale,
with adjustable values of the spectral index ns, tensor-to-scalar ratio
r=(2-4)x10^-3, and an inflaton mass close to 3x10^13 GeV. In the SUSY framework
we employ two gauge singlet chiral superfields, a logarithmic Kahler potential
including all the allowed terms up to fourth order in powers of the various
fields, and determine uniquely the superpotential by applying a continuous R
and a global U(1) symmetry. When the Kahler manifold exhibits a no-scale-type
symmetry, the model predicts ns=0.963 and r=0.004. Beyond no-scale SUGRA, ns
and r depend crucially on the coefficient involved in the fourth order term,
which mixes the inflaton with the accompanying non-inflaton field in the Kahler
potential, and the prefactor encountered in it. Increasing slightly the latter
above (-3), an efficient enhancement of the resulting r can be achieved putting
it in the observable range. The inflaton mass in the last case is confined in
the range (5-9)x10^13 GeV.

Motivated by the success of the hexagon bootstrap programme for constructing

which satisfies the MHV last-entry condition and is finite in the $7 \parallel

and remarkably its collinear limit is exactly the symbol of the three-loop

increases with decreasing galaxy luminosity and surface brightness. The

the dependence on luminosity following simply from the weaker correlation
between luminosity and surface brightness. In addition to this global relation,
there is also a local relation between the amplitude of the mass discrepancy
and the acceleration predicted by the observed distribution of baryons. I
provide an empirical calibration of this mass discrepancy-acceleration
relation. The data are consistent with the operation of a singe effective force
law in disk galaxies, making this relation tantamount to a natural law. I
further provide formulae by which the radial dark matter distribution can be
estimated from surface photometry. The form of the dark matter halo depends
uniquely on the distribution of baryons in each galaxy, and in general is
neither a cusp nor a core. It remains difficult to see how galaxy formation
models can reproduce the observed behavior, which is uniquely predicted by

fundamental problem in science. The most elementary form of such a causal
discovery problem is to decide whether X causes Y or, alternatively, Y causes
X, given joint observations of two variables X, Y. An example is to decide
whether altitude causes temperature, or vice versa, given only joint
measurements of both variables. Even under the simplifying assumptions of no
confounding, no feedback loops, and no selection bias, such bivariate causal
discovery problems are challenging. Nevertheless, several approaches for
addressing those problems have been proposed in recent years. We review two
families of such methods: Additive Noise Methods (ANM) and Information
Geometric Causal Inference (IGCI). We present the benchmark CauseEffectPairs
that consists of data for 100 different cause-effect pairs selected from 37
datasets from various domains (e.g., meteorology, biology, medicine,
engineering, economy, etc.) and motivate our decisions regarding the ""ground
truth"" causal directions of all pairs. We evaluate the performance of several
bivariate causal discovery methods on these real-world benchmark data and in
addition on artificially simulated data. Our empirical results on real-world
data indicate that certain methods are indeed able to distinguish cause from
effect using only purely observational data, although more benchmark data would
be needed to obtain statistically significant conclusions. One of the best
performing methods overall is the additive-noise method originally proposed by
Hoyer et al. (2009), which obtains an accuracy of 63+-10 % and an AUC of
0.74+-0.05 on the real-world benchmark. As the main theoretical contribution of
this work we prove the consistency of that method.

the ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) context. Analytical predictions and numerical
simulations of the complete equations within the Inertial
Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (ILLG) model are presented. In addition to the usual
precession resonance, the inertial model gives a second resonance peak
associated to the nutation dynamics provided that the damping is not too large.
The analytical resolution of the equations of motion yields both the precession
and nutation angular frequencies. They are function of the inertial dynamics
characteristic time $\tau$, the dimensionless damping $\alpha$ and the static
magnetic field $H$. A scaling function with respect to $\alpha\tau\gamma H$ is
found for the nutation angular frequency, also valid for the precession angular
frequency when $\alpha\tau\gamma H\gg 1$. Beyond the direct measurement of the
nutation resonance peak, we show that the inertial dynamics of the
magnetization has measurable effects on both the width and the angular
frequency of the precession resonance peak when varying the applied static
field. These predictions could be used to experimentally identify the inertial
dynamics of the magnetization proposed in the ILLG model.

unable to fit simultaneously the current observational data on Hubble expansion

redshift distribution of clusters predicted by all these models, in which the
analysis of the nonlinear perturbations becomes crucial. The outcome is that
the models with $C_0=0$ predict a number of counts with respect to the
concordance model which is much larger, or much smaller, than the $\Lambda$CDM

$\rho_\Lambda\propto H$ (the pure lineal model), which in the past was
repeatedly motivated by several authors from QCD arguments applied to

of SPP, however, the solar-wind speed is comparable to the Alfv\'en speed, and
Taylor's hypothesis in its usual form does not apply. In this paper, we show
that, under certain assumptions, a modified version of Taylor's hypothesis can
be recovered in the near-Sun region. We consider only the transverse,
non-compressive component of the fluctuations at length scales exceeding the
proton gyroradius, and we describe these fluctuations using an approximate
theoretical framework developed by Heinemann and Olbert. We show that
fluctuations propagating away from the Sun in the plasma frame obey a relation
analogous to Taylor's hypothesis when $V_{\rm sc,\perp} \gg z^-$ and $z^+ \gg
z^-$, where $V_{\rm sc,\perp}$ is the component of the spacecraft velocity
perpendicular to the mean magnetic field and $\bm{z}^+$ ($\bm{z}^-$) is the
Elsasser variable corresponding to transverse, non-compressive fluctuations
propagating away from (towards) the Sun in the plasma frame. Observations and
simulations suggest that, in the near-Sun solar wind, the above inequalities
are satisfied and $\bm{z}^+$ fluctuations account for most of the fluctuation
energy. The modified form of Taylor's hypothesis that we derive may thus make
it possible to characterize the spatial structure of the energetically dominant
component of the turbulence encountered by SPP.

the physical properties derived for our z>4 SMGs put them at the high end of

  Landau-Stuart Oscillators: Extensive Chaos and Clumped States",,,,,"nlin.CD","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, we study dynamical systems in which a large number $N$ of
identical Landau-Stuart oscillators are globally coupled via a mean-field.
Previously, it has been observed that this type of system can exhibit a variety
of different dynamical behaviors including clumped states in which each
oscillator is in one of a small number of groups for which all oscillators in
each group have the same state which is different from group to group, as well
as situations in which all oscillators have different states and the
macroscopic dynamics of the mean field is chaotic. We argue that this second
type of behavior is $^{\backprime}$extensive$^{\prime}$ in the sense that the
chaotic attractor in the full phase space of the system has a fractal dimension
that scales linearly with $N$ and that the number of positive Lyapunov
exponents of the attractor also scales with linearly $N$. An important focus of
this paper is the transition between clumped states and extensive chaos as the
system is subjected to slow adiabatic parameter change. We observe explosive
(i.e., discontinuous) transitions between the clumped states (which correspond
to low dimensional dynamics) and the extensively chaotic states. Furthermore,
examining the clumped state, as the system approaches the explosive transition
to extensive chaos, we find that the oscillator population distribution between
the clumps continually evolves so that the clumped state is always marginally
stable. This behavior is used to reveal the mechanism of the explosive
transition. We also apply the Kaplan-Yorke formula to study the fractal
structure of the extensively chaotic attractors.

clustering as a function of stellar mass, computed using two new versions of
the GALFORM semi-analytic galaxy formation model. These models make use of a
high resolution, large volume N-body simulation, set in the WMAP7 cosmology.
One model uses a universal stellar initial mass function (IMF), while the other
assumes different IMFs for quiescent star formation and bursts. Particular
consideration is given to how the assumptions required to estimate the stellar
masses of observed galaxies (such as the choice of IMF, stellar population
synthesis model and dust extinction) influence the perceived dependence of
galaxy clustering on stellar mass. Broad-band spectral energy distribution
fitting is carried out to estimate stellar masses for the model galaxies in the
same manner as in observational studies. We show clear differences between the
clustering signals computed using the true and estimated model stellar masses.
As such, we highlight the importance of applying our methodology to compare
theoretical models to observations. We introduce an alternative scheme for the
calculation of the merger timescales for satellite galaxies in GALFORM, which
takes into account the dark matter subhalo information from the simulation.
This reduces the amplitude of small-scale clustering. The new merger scheme
offers improved or similar agreement with observational clustering
measurements, over the redshift range 0 < z < 0.7. We find reasonable agreement
with clustering measurements from GAMA, but find larger discrepancies for some
stellar mass ranges and separation scales with respect to measurements from
SDSS and VIPERS, depending on the GALFORM model used.

the universe, and are therefore of special interest in the study of galaxy
evolution. The Milky Way (MW) and Andromeda (M31) have present day stellar
masses near M*, at 5x10^10 Msol (MW-mass) and 10^11 Msol (M31-mass). We study
the typical progenitors of these galaxies using ZFOURGE, a deep medium-band
near-IR imaging survey, which is sensitive to the progenitors of these galaxies
out to z~3. We use abundance-matching techniques to identify the main
progenitors of these galaxies at higher redshifts. We measure the evolution in
the stellar mass, rest-frame colors, morphologies, far-IR luminosities, and
star-formation rates combining our deep multiwavelength imaging with near-IR
HST imaging from CANDELS, and far-IR imaging from GOODS-H and CANDELS-H. The
typical MW-mass and M31-mass progenitors passed through the same evolution
stages, evolving from blue, star-forming disk galaxies at the earliest stages,
to redder dust-obscured IR-luminous galaxies in intermediate stages, and to
red, more quiescent galaxies at their latest stages. The progenitors of the
MW-mass galaxies reached each evolutionary stage at later times (lower
redshifts) and with stellar masses that are a factor of 2-3 lower than the
progenitors of the M31-mass galaxies. The process driving this evolution,
including the suppression of star-formation in present-day M* galaxies requires
an evolving stellar-mass/halo-mass ratio and/or evolving halo-mass threshold
for quiescent galaxies. The effective size and star-formation rates imply that
the baryonic cold-gas fractions drop as galaxies evolve from high redshift to
z~0 and are strongly anticorrelated with an increase in the S\'ersic index.
Therefore, the growth of galaxy bulges in M* galaxies corresponds to a rapid
decline in the galaxy gas fractions and/or a decrease in the star-formation
efficiency.

singularities may be realized, for instance, at the vertices of a cube, the
apex of a cone, etc. We find, using continuum analytical methods, that the
point of curvature binds an excess fractional charge. In addition, sequences of
states split away, energetically, from the degenerate bulk Landau levels.
Importantly, these inter-Landau level states are bound to the topological
singularity and have energies that are $\emph{universal}$ functions of bulk
parameters and the curvature. Remarkably, our exact diagonalization of lattice
tight-binding models on closed manifolds shows that these results continue to
hold even when lattice effects are significant, where the applicability of
continuum techniques could not have been justified a priori. Moreover, we
propose how these states may be readily experimentally actualized. An immediate

significant is the remnant's apparent Fe II distribution which consists of four

have suggested the importance of short (~10 Myr) episodes of rapid accretion

the host. Accretion of such clouds could potentially provide the dominant
source for black hole growth in high-z galaxies, but it remains unresolved in
cosmological simulations. Using a stochastic subgrid model calibrated by
high-resolution isolated galaxy simulations, we investigate the impact that
variability in black hole accretion rates has on black hole growth and the
evolution of the host galaxy. We find this clumpy accretion to more efficiently
fuel high-redshift black hole growth. This increased mass allows for more rapid
accretion even in the absence of high-density clumps, compounding the effect
and resulting in substantially faster overall black hole growth. This increased
growth allows the black hole to efficiently evacuate gas from the central
region of the galaxy, driving strong winds up to ~2500 km/s, producing outflows
~10x stronger than the smooth accretion case, suppressing the inflow of gas
onto the host galaxy, and suppressing the star formation within the galaxy by
as much as a factor of two. This suggests that the proper incorporation of
variability is a key factor in the co-evolution between black holes and their
hosts.

methods become less efficient as the temperature decreases. Here we provide the
first derivation of a general unattainability principle, which applies to

these resources into a minimal time or number of steps by considering the

inverse power of the cooling time. Our argument relies on the heat capacity of
the bath being positive, and we show that if this is not the case then perfect
cooling in finite time is in principle possible. Our results also clarify the

which predicts the evolution of states of a dynamical system (or observables
defined on the states) by following the evolution of the sample in a historical
record of observations which most closely resembles the current initial data.
Here, we introduce a suite of forecasting methods which improve traditional
analog forecasting by combining ideas from kernel methods developed in harmonic
analysis and machine learning and state-space reconstruction for dynamical
systems. A key ingredient of our approach is to replace single-analog
forecasting with weighted ensembles of analogs constructed using local
similarity kernels. The kernels used here employ a number of dynamics-dependent
features designed to improve forecast skill, including Takens' delay-coordinate
maps (to recover information in the initial data lost through partial
observations) and a directional dependence on the dynamical vector field
generating the data. Mathematically, our approach is closely related to kernel
methods for out-of-sample extension of functions, and we discuss alternative
strategies based on the Nystr\""om method and the multiscale Laplacian pyramids
technique. We illustrate these techniques in applications to forecasting in a
low-order deterministic model for atmospheric dynamics with chaotic
metastability, and interannual-scale forecasting in the North Pacific sector of
a comprehensive climate model. We find that forecasts based on kernel-weighted
ensembles have significantly higher skill than the conventional approach
following a single analog.

$R$. We are interested in the degree spectrum of $R$, either among computable
copies of $\mathcal{A}$ when $(\mathcal{A},R)$ is a ""natural"" structure, or (to
make this rigorous) among copies of $(\mathcal{A},R)$ computable in a large
degree \textbf{d}. We introduce the partial order of degree spectra \textit{on
a cone} and begin the study of these objects. Using a result of
Harizanov---that, assuming an effectiveness condition on $\mathcal{A}$ and $R$,
if $R$ is not intrinsically computable, then its degree spectrum contains all
c.e.\ degrees---we see that there is a minimal non-trivial degree spectrum on a
cone, consisting of the c.e.\ degrees. We show that this does not generalize to
d.c.e.\ degrees by giving an example of two incomparable degree spectra on a
cone. We also give a partial answer to a question of Ash and Knight: they asked
whether (subject to some effectiveness conditions) a relation which is not
intrinsically $\Delta^0_\alpha$ must have a degree spectrum which contains all
of the $\alpha$-CEA degrees. We give a positive answer to this question for
$\alpha = 2$ by showing that any degree spectrum on a cone which strictly
contains the $\Delta^0_2$ degrees must contain all of the 2-CEA degrees. We
also investigate the particular case of degree spectra on the structure
$(\omega,<)$. This work represents the beginning of an investigation of the
degree spectra of ""natural"" structures, and we leave many open questions to be

separation and the case where one does not. The resulting estimators have
several nice properties which make them ideal for cosmic shear data analysis.
First, they can be written as linear combinations of the binned cosmic shear
correlation functions. Second, they account for the survey window function in
real-space. Third, they are unbiased by shape noise since they do not use
correlation function data at zero separation. Fourth, the band-power window
functions in Fourier space are compact and largely non-oscillatory. Fifth, they
can be used to construct band-power estimators with very efficient data
compression properties. In particular, we find that all of the information on
the parameters $\Omega_{m}$, $\sigma_{8}$ and $n_{s}$ in the shear correlation
functions in the range of $\sim10-400$ arcminutes for single tomographic bin
can be compressed into only three band-power estimates. Finally, we can achieve
these rates of data compression while excluding small-scale information where
the modeling of the shear correlation functions and power spectra is very
difficult. Given these desirable properties, these estimators will be very
useful for cosmic shear data analysis.

Considering the information in the galaxy power spectrum, we here derive the
properties of a galaxy clustering survey that would optimize constraints on
primordial non-Gaussianity using this technique. Specifically, we ask the
question what survey design is needed to reach a precision $\sigma(f_{\rm
NL}^{\rm loc}) \approx 1$. To answer this question, we calculate the
sensitivity to $f_{\rm NL}^{\rm loc}$ as a function of galaxy number density,
redshift accuracy and sky coverage. We include the multitracer technique, which
helps minimize cosmic variance noise, by considering the possibility of
dividing the galaxy sample into stellar mass bins. We show that the ideal
survey for $f_{\rm NL}^{\rm loc}$ looks very different than most galaxy
redshift surveys scheduled for the near future. Since those are more or less
optimized for measuring the BAO scale, they typically require spectroscopic
redshifts. On the contrary, to optimize the $f_{\rm NL}^{\rm loc}$ measurement,
a deep, wide, multi-band imaging survey is preferred. An uncertainty
$\sigma(f_{\rm NL}^{\rm loc}) = 1$ can be reached with a full-sky survey that
is complete to an $i$-band AB magnitude $i \approx 23$ and has a number density
$\sim 8$ arcmin$^{-2}$. Requirements on the multi-band photometry are set by a
modest photo-$z$ accuracy $\sigma(z)/(1+z) < 0.1$ and the ability to measure
stellar mass with a precision $\sim 0.2$ dex or better (or another proxy for
halo mass with equivalent scatter). While here we focus on the information in
the power spectrum, even stronger constraints can potentially be obtained with
the galaxy bispectrum.

discuss another, less obvious situation, in which large relativistic effects
may arise due to a complicated, multiscale structure of the matter
distribution. I present an exact solution with an inhomogeneous energy density
distribution in the form of a hierarchy of nested voids and overdensities of
various sizes, extending from the homogeneity scale down to arbitrary small
scales. I show that although each of the voids and overdensities seems to be
very weakly relativistic, and thus easy to describe using the linearized
general relativity, the solution taken as a whole lies in fact in the nonlinear
regime. Its nonlinear properties are most easily seen when we compare the ADM
mass of the solution and the integral of the local mass density: the difference
between them, i.e. the relativistic mass deficit, can be significant provided
that the inhomogeneities extend to sufficiently small scales. The
non-additivity of masses implies a large backreaction effect, i.e. significant
discrepancy between the averaged, large-scale effective stress-energy tensor
and the naive average of the local energy density. I show that this is a
general relativistic effect arising due to the inhomogeneous, multiscale
structure. I also discuss the relevance of the results in cosmology and
relativistic astrophysics.

in general computationally heavy. In this paper, we propose a simple model of
dust enrichment in a galaxy with a simplified treatment of grain size
distribution by imposing a `two-size approximation'; that is, all the grain
population is represented by small (grain radius a < 0.03 micron) and large (a
> 0.03 micron) grains. We include in the model dust supply from stellar ejecta,
destruction in supernova shocks, dust growth by accretion, grain growth by
coagulation and grain disruption by shattering, considering how these processes
work on the small and large grains. We show that this simple framework
reproduces the main features found in full calculations of grain size
distributions as follows. The dust enrichment starts with the supply of large
grains from stars. At a metallicity level referred to as the critical
metallicity of accretion, the abundance of the small grains formed by
shattering becomes large enough to rapidly increase the grain abundance by
accretion. Associated with this epoch, the mass ratio of the small grains to
the large grains reaches the maximum. After that, this ratio converges to the
value determined by the balance between shattering and coagulation, and the
dust-to-metal ratio is determined by the balance between accretion and shock
destruction. With a Monte Carlo simulation, we demonstrate that the simplicity
of our model has an advantage in predicting statistical properties. We also
show some applications for predicting observational dust properties such as
extinction curves.

subset of input nodes, which then controls the remaining nodes via network
interactions. While techniques have been proposed for selecting input nodes
based on either performance metrics or controllability, a unifying approach
based on joint consideration of performance and controllability is an open
problem. In this paper, we develop a submodular optimization framework for
selecting input nodes based on joint performance and controllability in
structured linear descriptor systems. We develop our framework for arbitrary
linear descriptor systems. In developing our framework, we first prove that
selecting a minimum-size set of input nodes for controllability is a matroid
intersection problem that can be solved in polynomial-time in the network size.
We then prove that input selection to maximize a performance metric with
controllability as a constraint is equivalent to maximizing a monotone
submodular function with two matroid basis constraints, and derive efficient
approximation algorithms with provable optimality bounds for input selection.
Finally, we present a graph controllability index metric, which characterizes
the largest controllable subgraph of a given complex network, and prove its
submodular structure, leading to input selection algorithms that trade-off
performance and controllability. We provide improved optimality guarantees for
known systems such as strongly connected networks, consensus networks, networks
of double integrators, and networks where all system parameters (e.g., link
weights) are chosen independently and at random.

complexity of the query with and without inequalities. The main contribution of
our work is a novel combinatorial technique that enables us to use any
Select-Project-Join query plan for a given CQ without inequalities in answering
the CQ with inequalities, with an additional factor in running time that only
depends on the query. The key idea is to define a new projection operator,
which keeps a small representation (independent of the size of the database) of
the set of input tuples that map to each tuple in the output of the projection;
this representation is used to evaluate all the inequalities in the query.
Second, we generalize a result by Papadimitriou-Yannakakis [17] and give an
alternative algorithm based on the color-coding technique [4] to evaluate a CQ
with inequalities by using an algorithm for the CQ without inequalities. Third,
we investigate the structure of the query graph, inequality graph, and the
augmented query graph with inequalities, and show that even if the query and
the inequality graphs have bounded treewidth, the augmented graph not only can
have an unbounded treewidth but can also be NP-hard to evaluate. Further, we
illustrate classes of queries and inequalities where the augmented graphs have
unbounded treewidth, but the CQ with inequalities can be evaluated in
poly-time. Finally, we give necessary properties and sufficient properties that
allow a class of CQs to have poly-time combined complexity with respect to any
inequality pattern. We also illustrate classes of queries where our
query-plan-based technique outperforms the alternative approaches discussed in
the paper.

important question is how to efficiently study these data. One can simply model
a temporal network as either a single aggregate static network, or as a series
of time-specific snapshots, each of which is an aggregate static network over
the corresponding time window. The advantage of modeling the temporal data in
these two ways is that one can use existing well established methods for static
network analysis to study the resulting aggregate network(s). Here, we develop
a novel approach for studying temporal network data more explicitly. We base
our methodology on the well established notion of graphlets (subgraphs), which
have been successfully used in numerous contexts in static network research.
Here, we take the notion of static graphlets to the next level and develop new
theory needed to allow for graphlet-based analysis of temporal networks. Our
new notion of dynamic graphlets is quite different than existing approaches for
dynamic network analysis that are based on temporal motifs (statistically
significant subgraphs). Namely, these approaches suffer from many limitations.
For example, they can only deal with subgraph structures of limited complexity.
Also, their major drawback is that their results heavily depend on the choice
of a null network model that is required to evaluate the significance of a
subgraph. However, choosing an appropriate null network model is a non-trivial
task. Our dynamic graphlet approach overcomes the limitations of the existing
temporal motif-based approaches. At the same time, when we thoroughly evaluate
the ability of our new approach to characterize the structure and function of
an entire temporal network or of individual nodes, we find that the dynamic
graphlet approach outperforms the static graphlet approach, which indicates
that accounting for temporal information helps.

on d-dimensional torus. We focus our attention on scattering of moduli and
gauge bosons. These states appear when massless excitations such as graviton
and antisymmetric tensor field of the uncompactified theory are dimensionally
reduced to lower dimension. The toroidally compactified theory is endowed with
the T-duality symmetry, O(d,d). Therefore, it is expected that the amplitude
for scattering of such states will be $T$-duality invariant. The formalism of
Kawai-Llewelen-Tye is adopted and appropriately tailored to construct the
vertex operators of moduli and gauge bosons. It is shown, in our approach, that
N-point amplitude is T-duality invariant. We present illustrative examples for
the four point amplitude to explicitly demonstrate the economy of our formalism
when three spatial dimensions are compactified on three dimensional torus. It
is also shown that if we construct an amplitude with a set of 'initial'
backgrounds, the T-duality operation transforms it to an amplitude associated
with another set backgrounds. We propose a modified version of KLT approach to
construct vertex operators for nonabelian massless gauge bosons which appear in

often involve either individually beneficial ""uphill"" mutations or more complex
mutational trajectories involving fitness valleys or plateaus. The dynamics of
the evolutionary process determine the probability that evolution will take any
specific path among a variety of competing possible trajectories. Understanding
this evolutionary choice is essential if we are to understand the outcomes and
predictability of adaptation on rugged landscapes. We present a simple model to
analyze the probability that evolution will eschew immediately uphill paths in
favor of crossing fitness valleys or plateaus that lead to higher fitness but
less accessible genotypes. We calculate how this probability depends on the
population size, mutation rates, and relevant selection pressures, and compare
our analytical results to Wright-Fisher simulations. We find that the
probability of valley crossing depends nonmonotonically on population size:
intermediate size populations are most likely to follow a ""greedy"" strategy of
acquiring immediately beneficial mutations even if they lead to evolutionary
dead ends, while larger and smaller populations are more likely to cross
fitness valleys to reach distant advantageous genotypes. We explicitly identify
the boundaries between these different regimes in terms of the relevant
evolutionary parameters. Above a certain threshold population size, we show
that the degree of evolutionary ""foresight"" depends only on a single simple
combination of the relevant parameters.

produced by their active star formation, and it is difficult to measure their
activity in the optical wavelength. We have carried out Pa$\alpha$ narrow-band
imaging observations of 38 nearby star-forming galaxies including 33 LIRGs
listed in $IRAS$ RBGS catalog with the Atacama Near InfraRed camera (ANIR) on
the University of Tokyo Atacama Observatory (TAO) 1.0 m telescope (miniTAO).
Star formation rates (SFRs) estimated from the Pa$\alpha$ fluxes, corrected for
dust extinction using the Balmer Decrement Method (typically $A_V$ $\sim$ 4.3
mag), show a good correlation with those from the bolometric infrared
luminosity of $IRAS$ data within a scatter of 0.27 dex. This suggests that the
correction of dust extinction for Pa$\alpha$ flux is sufficient in our sample.
We measure the physical sizes and the surface density of infrared luminosities
($\Sigma_{L(\mathrm{IR})}$) and $SFR$ ($\Sigma_{SFR}$) of star-forming region
for individual galaxies, and find that most of the galaxies follow a sequence
of local ultra luminous or luminous infrared galaxies (U/LIRGs) on the
$L(\mathrm{IR})$-$\Sigma_{L(\mathrm{IR})}$ and $SFR$-$\Sigma_{SFR}$ plane. We
confirm that a transition of the sequence from normal galaxies to U/LIRGs is
seen at $L(\mathrm{IR})=8\times10^{10}$ $L_{\odot}$. Also, we find that there
is a large scatter in physical size, different from those of normal galaxies or
ULIRGs. Considering the fact that most of U/LIRGs are merging or interacting
galaxies, this scatter may be caused by strong external factors or differences
of their merging stage.

of cycles with a little differences to usal cycles, which is called ""STOC"" in
the body of this article. We find some analytic relations between thesm, STOC
and some indeces. Moreover we can find the total number of STOCs in a network,
analytically. This consideration leads to an extension of the celebrated
""Euler's polyhedron formula"", which is only applicable to planar graphs. This
extended formula is applicable to any graphs. Last we estimate numerically the
indeces and the number of STOCs based on the theoretical considerations for
some complex networks and make some discussion on the effects of cycles in

galaxy 3C 120 in the MeV/GeV, sub-millimeter, and 43 GHz bands over six years.
Over the past two years, Fermi-LAT sporadically detected 3C 120 with high
significance and the 230 GHz data also suggest an enhanced activity of the
source. After the MeV/GeV detection from 3C 120 in MJD 56240-56300, 43 GHz VLBA
monitoring revealed a brightening of the radio core, followed by the ejection
of a superluminal knot. Since we observed the gamma-ray and VLBA phenomena in
temporal proximity to each other, it is naturally assumed that they are
physically connected. This assumption was further supported by the subsequent
observation that the 43 GHz core brightened again after a gamma-ray flare
occurred around MJD 56560. We can then infer that the MeV/GeV emission took
place inside an unresolved 43 GHz core of 3C 120 and that the jet dissipation
occurred at sub-parsec distances from the central black hole, if we take the
distance of the 43 GHz core from the central black hole as ~ 0.5 pc, as
previously estimated from the time lag between X-ray dips and knot ejections
(Marscher et al. 2002; Chatterjee et al. 2009). Based on our constraints on the
relative locations of the emission regions and energetic arguments, we conclude
that the gamma rays are more favorably produced via the synchrotron
self-Compton process, rather than inverse Compton scattering of external
photons coming from the broad line region or hot dusty torus. We also derived
the electron distribution and magnetic field by modeling the simultaneous
broadband spectrum.

on-the-fly binary acceleration mechanism which aims to tackle the problem of
enabling existent software to automatically utilize accelerators at runtime.
BAAR is based on the LLVM Compiler Infrastructure and has a client-server
architecture. The client runs the program to be accelerated in an environment
which allows program analysis and profiling. Program parts which are identified
as suitable for the available accelerator are exported and sent to the server.
The server optimizes these program parts for the accelerator and provides RPC
execution for the client. The client transforms its program to utilize
accelerated execution on the server for offloaded program parts.
  We evaluate our work with a proof-of-concept implementation of BAAR that uses
an Intel Xeon Phi 5110P as the acceleration target and performs automatic
offloading, parallelization and vectorization of suitable program parts. The
practicality of BAAR for real-world examples is shown based on a study of
stencil codes. Our results show a speedup of up to 4x without any
developer-provided hints and 5.77x with hints over the same code compiled with
the Intel Compiler at optimization level O2 and running on an Intel Xeon
E5-2670 machine. Based on our insights gained during implementation and
evaluation we outline future directions of research, e.g., offloading more
fine-granular program parts than functions, a more sophisticated communication
mechanism or introducing on-stack-replacement.

projection chamber (TPC) and pixel scintillator arrays (PSAs). Since the TPC
measures the three dimensional tracks of Compton-recoil electrons, the ETCC can
completely reconstruct the incident gamma rays. Moreover, the ETCC demonstrates
efficient background rejection power in Compton-kinematics tests, identifies
particle from the energy deposit rate (dE/dX) registered in the TPC, and
provides high quality imaging by completely reconstructing the Compton
scattering process. We are planning the ""Sub-MeV gamma ray Imaging
Loaded-on-balloon Experiment"" (SMILE) for our proposed all-sky survey
satellite. Performance tests of a mid-sized 30 cm-cubic ETCC, constructed for
observing the Crab nebula, are ongoing. However, observations at balloon
altitudes or satellite orbits are obstructed by radiation background from the
atmosphere and the detector itself. The background rejection power was checked
using proton accelerator experiments conducted at the Research Center for
Nuclear Physics, Osaka University. To create the intense radiation fields
encountered in space, which comprise gamma rays, neutrons, protons, and other
energetic entities, we irradiated a water target with a 140 MeV proton beam and
placed a SMILE-II ETCC near the target. In this situation, the counting rate
was five times than that expected at the balloon altitude. Nonetheless, the
ETCC stably operated and identified particles sufficiently to obtain a clear
gamma ray image of the checking source. Here, we report the performance of our
detector and demonstrate its effective background rejection based in electron
tracking experiments.

shown that in the presence of matter, the fuzziness of topology will be

observations with Herschel and APEX have revealed the temperature minimum of
alpha Cen, but these were unable to spatially resolve the binary into

shortcoming. Furthermore, these earlier data were limited to the wavelength
region between 100 and 870mu. In the present context, we intend to extend the
spectral mapping to longer wavelengths, where the contrast between stellar
photospheric and chromospheric emission becomes increasingly evident. ALMA is
particularly suited to point sources, such as unresolved stars. ALMA provides
the means to achieve our objectives with both its high sensitivity of the
collecting area for the detection of weak signals and the high spatial
resolving power of its adaptable interferometer for imaging close multiple
stars. This is the first detection of main-sequence stars at a wavelength of
3mm. Furthermore, the individual components of the binary alpha CenAB are
clearly detected and spatially well resolved at all ALMA wavelengths. The high
S/N of these data permit accurate determination of their relative flux ratios.
The previously obtained flux ratio of 0.44, which was based on measurements in

quantitatively clarify the observed variability of these objects. We used the

properties of circumstellar matter. Methods: Our code takes into account
acceleration of the wind due to the Roche effective potential, Coriolis force,
gas pressure, and (CAK-) radiative pressure in the lines and continuum of the
supergiant radiation field that is modulated by its gravity darkening and by
the photo-ionization caused by X-ray radiation from the compact companion. The

Results: Both two- and three-dimensional numerical simulations show that the
Coriolis force substantially influences the mass loss and consequently the
accretion rate onto the compact companion. The gravitational field of the
compact companion focuses the stellar wind, which leads to the formation of a
curved cone-like gaseous tail behind the companion. The changes of X-ray
photo-ionization of the wind material during X-ray spectral-state transitions
significantly influence the wind structure and offer an explanation of the

post-processing techniques that automatically sparsify brain maps and separate

two branches: surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs) propagating in plasmonic

plasmonic particles. Investigations along these two directions usually employ
quite different approaches and techniques, resulting in more or less a dogma
that the two branches progress almost independently of each other, with few
interactions. Here in this work we interpret LSPs from a Bohr model based
geometric perspective relying on SPPs, thus establishing a connection between
these two sub-fields. Besides the clear explanations of conventional scattering
features of plasmonic nanoparticles, based on this geometric model we further
demonstrate other anomalous scattering features (higher order modes supported
at lower frequencies, and blueshift of the resonance with increasing particle
sizes) and multiple electric resonances of the same order supported at
different frequencies, which have been revealed to originate from backward SPP
modes and multiple dispersion bands supported in the corresponding plasmonic
waveguides, respectively. Inspired by this geometric model, it is also shown
that, through solely geometric tuning, the absorption of each LSP resonance can
be maximized to reach the single channel absorption limit, provided that the
scattering and absorption rates are tuned to be equal. The Bohr model based
geometric picture offers new insights into the understanding of the localized
resonances, and may shed new light to many related applications based on

tension. We have used a time- and space-resolved technique to measure the
thickness field of this class of liquid sheet, based on the grey level
measurement of the image of a dyed liquid sheet recorded using a fast camera.
This method enables a precise measurement of the thickness in the range
$(10-450) \, \mathrm{\mu m}$, with a temporal resolution equal to that of the
camera. We have measured the evolution with time since impact, $t$, and radial
position, $r$, of the thickness, $h(r,t)$, for various drop volumes and impact
velocities. Two asymptotic regimes for the expansion of the sheet are
evidenced. The scalings of the thickness with $t$ and $r$ measured in the two
regimes are those that were predicted in \citet{Rozhkov2004} fort the
short-time regime and \citet{Villermaux2011} for the long time regime, but
never experimentally measured before. Interestingly, our experimental data also
evidence the existence of a maximum of the film thickness $h_{\rm{max}}(r)$ at
a radial position $r_{\rm{h_{max}}}(t)$ corresponding to the crossover of these
two asymptotic regimes. The maximum moves with a constant velocity of the order
of the drop impact velocity, as expected theoretically. Thanks to our

generated by a set of vertical flaps which continuously injects velocity
fluctuations towards the center of a rotating water tank. The energy transfers
are evaluated from two-point third-order three-component velocity structure
functions, which we measure using stereoscopic particle image velocimetry in
the rotating frame. Without global rotation, the energy is transferred from
large to small scales, as in classical three-dimensional turbulence. For
nonzero rotation rates, the horizontal kinetic energy presents a double
cascade: a direct cascade at small horizontal scales and an inverse cascade at
large horizontal scales. By contrast, the vertical kinetic energy is always
transferred from large to small horizontal scales, a behavior reminiscent of
the dynamics of a passive scalar in two-dimensional turbulence. At the largest
rotation rate the flow is nearly two-dimensional, and a pure inverse energy
cascade is found for the horizontal energy. To describe the scale-by-scale
energy budget, we consider a generalization of the K\'arm\'an-Howarth-Monin

evident in indicators of solar activity, including solar irradiance. Although a
relationship between solar activity and the brightness of the Sun had long been
suspected, it was only directly observed after regular satellite measurements
became available with the launch of Nimbus-7 in 1978. The measurement of solar
irradiance from space is accompanied by the development of models aimed at
describing the apparent variability by the intensity excess/deficit effected by
magnetic structures in the photosphere. The more sophisticated models, termed
semi-empirical, rely on the intensity spectra of photospheric magnetic
structures generated with radiative transfer codes from semi-empirical model
atmospheres. An established example of such models is SATIRE-S (Spectral And
Total Irradiance REconstruction for the Satellite era). One key limitation of
current semi-empirical models is the fact that the radiant properties of
network and faculae are not adequately represented due to the use of
plane-parallel model atmospheres (as opposed to three-dimensional model
atmospheres). This thesis is the compilation of four publications, detailing
the results of investigations aimed at setting the groundwork necessary for the
eventual introduction of three-dimensional atmospheres into SATIRE-S and a
review of the current state of the measurement and modelling of solar
irradiance. Also presented is an update of the SATIRE-S model. We generated a
daily reconstruction of total and spectral solar irradiance, covering 1974 to

The calculations show that the binding energy of the Mn-acceptor is essentially
unaffected by the presence of a neutral As vacancy, even at the shortest

simple tip-induced-band-bending theory and in agreement with experiment, for a

reduced as the As vacancy is brought closer to the Mn impurity. For two Mn

enhance the energy level splitting of the associated coupled acceptor levels,
leading to an increase of the effective exchange interaction. Neutral vacancies
leave the exchange splitting unchanged. Since it is experimentally possible to
switch reversibly between the two charge states of the vacancy, such a local
electric manipulation of the magnetic dopants could result in an efficient
real-time control of their exchange interaction.

Building on our previous work we consider the effective theory describing the
moduli of the gauge theory, which can be computed precisely when it is weakly
coupled far out on the Coulomb branch. Whilst for perturbation theory naive
extrapolation from weak coupling to strong gives little information, for this
moduli theory naive extrapolation from its weakly to its strongly coupled
regime appears to encode a surprising amount of information about the various
strongly coupled phases. We argue it encodes not only the parametric form of
thermodynamic quantities for these strongly coupled phases, but also certain
transcendental factors with a geometric origin, and allows one to deduce
transitions between the phases. We emphasise it also gives predictions for the

found that the cosmic-ray-induced effects are mostly limited to an increase in

increased. Conclusions. Among the processes considered in the model,
dissociation is probably the most significant, while diffusion and reactions on

ubiquity of low-mass X-ray binaries, thought to be the progenitors of
millisecond pulsars (MSPs), explain the large number of observed GC radio
pulsars and X-ray counterparts. The Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) recently
unveiled the first gamma-ray GC pulsar (PSR J1823-3021A). The first
observations of GCs in the GeV and TeV bands furthermore created much

expected to radiate several pulsed spectral components in the radio through
gamma-ray wavebands, in addition to being sources of relativistic particles.

partial differential equations in high dimensions have recently attracted
significant attention. A critical issue is to rigorously bound the error of
such approximations, not with respect to a fixed finite dimensional discrete
background problem, but with respect to the exact solution of the continuous
problem. While the energy norm offers a natural error measure corresponding to
the underlying operator considered as an isomorphism from the energy space onto
its dual, this norm requires a careful treatment in its interplay with the
tensor structure of the problem. In this paper we build on our previous work on
energy norm-convergent subspace-based tensor schemes contriving, however, a
modified formulation which now enforces convergence only in $L_2$. In order to
still be able to exploit the mapping properties of elliptic operators, a
crucial ingredient of our approach is the development and analysis of a
suitable asymmetric preconditioning scheme. We provide estimates for the
computational complexity of the resulting method in terms of the solution error
and study the practical performance of the scheme in numerical experiments. In
both regards, we find that controlling solution errors in this weaker norm
leads to substantial simplifications and to a reduction of the actual numerical

pseudopotentials. The well known discrepancies between experimental data and
DFT-calculated results for structural parameters of iron chalcogenides are
related to the semicore atomic states which were frozen in the used here
approach. Such an approach yields valid results of the electronic structures of
the investigated compounds. The Ru-based chalcogenides exhibit the same
topology of the Fermi surface (FS) as that of FeSe, differing only in subtle FS
nesting features. Our calculations predict that the ground states of RuSe and
RuTe are nonmagnetic, whereas those of the solid solutions Ru$_x$Fe$_{1-x}$Se
and Ru$_x$Fe$_{1-x}$Te become the single- and double-stripe antiferromagnetic,
respectively. However, the calculated stabilization energy values are
comparable for each system. The phase transitions between these magnetic
arrangements may be induced by slight changes of the chalcogen atom positions
and the lattice parameters $a$ in the unit cell of iron selenides and

mediated by the spin fluctuations in single-stripe magnetic phase, the

Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) in modeling the accretion of gas onto a
binary system, a problem with important applications to the evolution of
proto-binaries as well as accreting binary super massive black holes. It has
previously been suggested that SPH fails to model the flow of loosely bound
material from the secondary to primary Roche lobe and that its general
prediction that accretion drives mass ratios upwards is numerically flawed.
Here we show with 2D SPH that this flow from secondary to primary Roche lobe is
a sensitive function of gas temperature and that this largely explains the
conflicting claims in the literature which have hitherto been based on either
'cold' SPH simulations or 'hot' grid based calculations. We present simulations
of a specimen 'cold' and 'hot' accretion scenario which are numerically
converged and evolved into a steady state. Our analysis of the conservation of
the Jacobi integral of accreting particles indicates that our results are not
strongly compromised by numerical dissipation. We also explore the low
resolution limit and find that simulations where the ratio of SPH smoothing
length to disc scale height at the edge of the circumsecondary is less than 1

of low resolution is considered. In comparison to an ideal receiver with
infinite receive resolution, the performance loss of a simplistic receiver with
1-bit resolution is investigated. For the case where the measurement data is
preprocessed by a symmetric hard-limiting device with 1-bit output, it is
well-understood that the performance for low SNR channel parameter estimation
degrades moderately by 2/pi (-1.96 dB). Here we show that the 1-bit
quantization loss can be significantly smaller if information about the
temporal evolution of the channel parameters is taken into account in the form
of a state-space model. By the analysis of a Bayesian bound for the achievable
tracking performance, we attain the result that the quantization loss in dB is
in general smaller by a factor of two if the channel evolution is slow. For the
low SNR regime, this is equivalent to a reduced loss of sqrt(2/pi) (-0.98 dB).
By simulating non-linear filtering algorithms for a satellite-based ranging
application (GPS) and a UWB channel estimation problem, both with
low-complexity 1-bit analog-to-digital converter (ADC) at the receiver, we
verify that the analytical characterization of the tracking error is accurate.
This shows that the performance loss due to observations with low amplitude
resolution can, in practice, be much less pronounced than indicated by
classical results. Finally, we discuss the implication of the result for medium
SNR applications like channel estimation in the context of mobile wireless
communications.

attractive targets as potential new distance indicators. It is still not clear
whether the relations proposed so far originate from an unknown GRB physics or
result from selection effects. We investigate this issue in the case of the
$L_X-T^*_a$ correlation (hereafter LT) between the X-ray luminosity $L_X (T_a)$
at the end of the plateau phase, $T_a$, and the rest frame time $T^{*}_a$. We
devise a general method to build mock data sets starting from a GRB world model
and taking into account selection effects on both time and luminosity. This
method shows how not knowing the efficiency function could influence the
evaluation of the intrinsic slope of any correlation and the GRB density rate.
We investigate biases (small offsets in slope or normalization) that would
occur in the LT relation as a result of truncations, possibly present in the
intrinsic distributions of $L_X$ and $T^*_a$. We compare these results with the
ones in Dainotti et al. (2013) showing that in both cases the intrinsic slope
of the LT correlation is $\approx -1.0$. This method is general, therefore
relevant to investigate if any other GRB correlation is generated by the biases
themselves. Moreover, because the farthest GRBs and star-forming galaxies probe
the reionization epoch, we evaluate the redshift-dependent ratio
$\Psi(z)=(1+z)^{\alpha}$ of the GRB rate to star formation rate (SFR). We found
a modest evolution $-0.2\leq \alpha \leq 0.5$ consistent with Swift GRB
afterglow plateau in the redshift range $0.99<z<9.4$.

of graphs related to this differential. These Nakamura graphs were used to
parametrise the cells in a light-cone cell decomposition of moduli space. We
develop links between Nakamura graphs and realisations of the worldsheet as

those of top dimension, there is a simple relation to Belyi maps, which allows
us to use results from Hermitian and complex matrix models to give analytic
formulae for the counting of cells at arbitrarily high genus. For the most

organises the cells and allows efficient enumeration of Nakamura graphs using

creation and entropy reduction can be fulfilled for the enzymatic molecular
machines with the stochastic dynamics, which offers a choice of the work
performance in a variety of ways. A model of such dynamics, specified by a
critical complex network, is investigated. The main conclusion of the study is
that the processing of free energy has to be distinguished from the processing
of organization, which we identify with an adequately defined thermodynamic
variable. Maxwell's demon utilizes entropy reduction for creation of
information, which, from the former point of view, may be used for a reduction
of energy losses, hence ultimately, for the performance of work. From the
latter point of view, however, it can be used for other purposes, for example
molecular recognition. This can be the case of biological molecular machines.
From the biological perspective, the ascertainment is important, that the
information creation and storage take place in the long lasting transient
stages before completing the free energy transduction cycles. From a broader
physical perspective, a supposition could be of special importance, that
information is a change of organization, the thermodynamic function of state of
the system.

Problem. Assume a simple polygon $P$ is guarded by a finite set of point guards
and each guard is assigned one of $t$ colors. Such a chromatic guarding is said
to be conflict-free if each point $p\in P$ sees at least one guard with a
unique color among all guards visible from $p$. The goal is to establish bounds
on the function $\chi_{cf}(n)$ of the number of colors sufficient to guarantee
the existence of a conflict-free chromatic guarding for any $n$-vertex polygon.
B\""artschi and Suri showed $\chi_{cf}(n)\in O(\log n)$ (Algorithmica, 2014) for
simple orthogonal polygons and the same bound applies to general simple
polygons (B\""artschi et al., SoCG 2014). In this paper, we assume the
r-visibility model instead of standard line visibility. Points $p$ and $q$ in
an orthogonal polygon are r-visible to each other if the rectangle spanned by
the points is contained in $P$. For this model we show $\chi_{cf}(n)\in
O(\log\log n)$ and $\chi_{cf}(n)\in \Omega(\log\log n /\log\log\log n)$. Most
interestingly, we can show that the lower bound proof extends to guards with
line visibility. To this end we introduce and utilize a novel discrete
combinatorial structure called multicolor tableau. This is the first
non-trivial lower bound for this problem setting.Furthermore, for the strong
chromatic version of the problem, where all guards r-visible from a point must
have distinct colors, we prove a $\Theta(\log n)$-bound. Our results can be
interpreted as coloring results for special geometric hypergraphs.

transient signals (on the order of seconds or minutes) originating from this
location would appear in our data. We also consider how automatic radio
frequency interference (RFI) flagging at radio telescope observatories might
affect these and other transient observations in the future, particularly with
brief transients of a few seconds duration.
  Methods: We observed the field in the low-frequency regime at 149 MHz with
data obtained over several months with the Low Frequency Array (LOFAR). We also
present simulations where a brief transient is injected into the data in order
to see how it would appear in our measurement sets, and how it would be
affected by RFI flagging. Finally, both based on simulation work and the
weighted average of the observed background over the course of the individual
observations, we present the possibility of brief radio transients in the data.
  Results: Our observations of Swift J1644+57 yielded no detection of the
source and a peak flux density at this position of 24.7 $\pm$ 8.9 mJy. Our
upper limit on the transient rate of the snapshot surface density in this field
at sensitivities < 0.5 Jy is $\rho < 2.2 \times10^{-2}$ deg$^{-2}$. We also
conclude that we did not observe any brief transient signals originating
specifically from the Swift J1644+57 source itself, and searches for such
transients are severely limited by automatic RFI flagging algorithms which flag
transients of less than 2 minutes duration. As such, careful consideration of
RFI flagging techniques must occur when searching for transient signals.

fermions beyond the self-consistent field approximation. It is shown that the
exchange interaction of electric dipolar fermions depends on the
spin-polarisation of the system. For instance the electric dipole exchange
interaction equals to zero for spin-unpolarised systems, namely all low laying
quantum states occupied by two-particles with opposite spins. In opposite limit
of the full spin polarisation of the degenerate fermions, then we have one
particle in each quantum states, the exchange interaction has maximum value,
which is comparable with the self-consistent field part of the dipole-dipole

gives a positive contribution into the spectrum of collective excitations,
while the exchange part of the dipole-dipole interaction leads to a negative
term in the spectrum. At angles between the equilibrium polarisation and the
direction of wave propagation close to $\pi/2$ the full dipolar part of the

Infrared Survey Explorer data, we find no dependence of mass-normalized
integrated SFRs of galaxy groups/clusters on their virial masses. We classify
the supercluster galaxies into three classes in the MIR color-luminosity
diagram: MIR blue cloud (massive, quiescent and mostly early-type), MIR
star-forming sequence (mostly late-type), and MIR green valley galaxies. These
MIR green valley galaxies are distinguishable from the optical green valley
galaxies, in the sense that they belong to the optical red sequence. We find
that the fraction of each MIR class does not depend on virial mass of each
group/cluster. We compare the cumulative distributions of surface galaxy number
density and cluster/group-centric distance for the three MIR classes. MIR green
valley galaxies show the distribution between MIR blue cloud and MIR SF
sequence galaxies. However, if we fix galaxy morphology, early- and late-type
MIR green valley galaxies show different distributions. Our results suggest a
possible evolutionary scenario of these galaxies: 1) Late-type MIR SF sequence
galaxies -> 2) Late-type MIR green valley galaxies -> 3) Early-type MIR green
valley galaxies -> 4) Early-type MIR blue cloud galaxies. In this sequence,
star formation of galaxies is quenched before the galaxies enter the MIR green
valley, and then morphological transformation occurs in the MIR green valley.

to increases of at least 20% for n=3 and n=4 RMPs and 60% for n=6 RMPs. This

different states can lead to a speed-up over classical computers [1], but
quantum mechanics also allows for the superposition of quantum circuits [2]. In
fact, it has recently been theoretically predicted that superimposing quantum
circuits, each with a different gate order, could provide quantum computers
with an even further computational advantage [3-5]. Here, we experimentally
demonstrate this enhancement by applying two quantum gates in a superposition
of both possible orders to determine whether the two gates commute or
anti-commute. We are able to make this determination with only a single use (or
query) of each gate, while all quantum circuits with a fixed order of gates
would require at least two uses of one of the gates [3]. Remarkably, when the
problem is scaled to N gates, creating a superposition of quantum circuits is
likely to provide an exponential advantage over classical algorithms, and a
linear advantage over quantum algorithms with fixed gate order [4]. The new
resource that we exploit in our experiment can be interpreted as a
""superposition of causal orders"". We demonstrate such a superposition could
allow some quantum algorithms to be implemented with an efficiency that is
unlikely to be achieved on a quantum computer with a fixed gate order.

background anisotropies are detected such that the correlation coefficient at a
few to ten arcminute angular scales decreases from 0.3 to 0.1 when the far-IR
wavelength increases from 250 {\mu}m to 500 {\mu}m. We model the
cross-correlation using a halo model with three components: (a) far-IR bright
or dusty star-forming galaxies below the masking depth in Herschel maps, (b)
near-IR faint galaxies below the masking depth at 3.6 {\mu}m, and (c)
intra-halo light, or diffuse stars in dark matter halos, that likely dominates
fluctuations at 3.6 {\mu}m. The model is able to reasonably reproduce the auto
correlations at each of the far-IR wavelengths and at 3.6 {\mu}m and their
corresponding cross-correlations. While the far and near-IR auto-correlations
are dominated by faint dusty, star-forming galaxies and intra-halo light,
respectively, we find that roughly half of the cross-correlation between near
and far-IR backgrounds is due to the same galaxies that remain unmasked at 3.6
{\mu}m. The remaining signal in the cross-correlation is due to intra-halo
light present in the same dark matter halos as those hosting the same faint and
unmasked galaxies. In this model, the decrease in the cross-correlation signal
from 250 {\mu}m to 500 {\mu}m comes from the fact that the galaxies that are
primarily contributing to 500 {\mu}m fluctuations peak at a higher redshift
than those at 250 {\mu}m.

then analyzing the topological structure of the ground state wave functional
which is inherited from the latter term. A boson-vortex duality transformation
is employed to examine the topological stability of the ground state in the
absence/presence of a perturbation violating link-center inversion symmetry.
Our prediction based on field theories is verified by means of a numerical
study of the entanglement spectra of actual spin chains, which we find to
exhibit twofold degeneracies when the aforementioned condition is met. We

circuits is physical design automation, where one needs to compute the best
physical layout of millions to billions of circuit components on a tiny silicon

involves a number of physical design stages, one of which is clustering. In
this paper, we focus on problems in clustering which are critical for more
sustainable chips. The clustering problem in combinatorial circuits alone is a
source of multiple models. In particular, we consider the problem of clustering
combinatorial circuits for delay minimization, when logic replication is not
allowed ({\sc CN}). The problem of delay minimization when logic replication is
allowed ({\sc CA}) has been well studied, and is known to be solvable in
polynomial-time \cite{Wong1}. However, unbounded logic replication can be quite
expensive. Thus, {\sc CN} is an important problem. We show that selected
variants of {\sc CN} are {\bf NP-hard}. We also obtain approximability and
inapproximability results for these problems. A preliminary version of this

construction of quantum mind theories. Nevertheless, the quantum physicist
Henry Stapp promoted the view that the mind could utilize quantum Zeno effect
to influence brain dynamics and that the efficacy of such mental efforts would
not be undermined by environmental decoherence of the brain. To address the
physical plausibility of Stapp's claim, we modeled the brain using quantum
tunneling of an electron in a multiple-well structure such as the voltage
sensor in neuronal ion channels and performed Monte Carlo simulations of
quantum Zeno effect exerted by the mind upon the brain in the presence or
absence of environmental decoherence. The simulations unambiguously showed that
the quantum Zeno effect breaks down for timescales greater than the brain
decoherence time. To generalize the Monte Carlo simulation results for any
n-level quantum system, we further analyzed the change of brain entropy due to
the mind probing actions and proved a theorem according to which local
projections cannot decrease the von Neumann entropy of the unconditional brain
density matrix. The latter theorem establishes that Stapp's model is physically
implausible but leaves a door open for future development of quantum mind
theories provided the brain has a decoherence-free subspace.

nodal infection probability is thus expected to depend mainly on the
interaction of a few, large interconnected clusters. In this work, we describe
the epidemic process as a continuous-time individual-based

smaller quotient graph (which only captures the macroscopic structure of the
community network) is all we need to know in order to decide whether the
overall healthy-state defines a globally asymptotically stable or an unstable
equilibrium. Indeed, the spectral radius is related to the epidemic threshold
of the system. Moreover we prove that, above the threshold, another
steady-state exists that can be computed using a lower-dimensional dynamical
system associated with the evolution of the process on the quotient graph. Our

the range 75-200 MeV/c present two unexpected features: (a) antineutron and
antiproton cross sections have a similar size, (ii) the rise of the antineutron
cross section at decreasing energy is much steeper than predictable for an
inelastic process of purely strong nature at that energy. The observed behavior
of antineutron-nucleus annihilations is similar to what would be expected for
antiproton-nucleus annihilations, where Coulomb attraction focusses antiproton
trajectories towards the nucleus, enhancing the inelastic cross section by a
factor O(1/p) with respect to antineutrons on the same target. This results in
a 1/p^2 behavior at small energies. The presence of a similar enhancement in
the antineutron case may only be justified by an interaction with a longer
range than strong interactions. Excluding a Coulomb force because of the
antineutron neutrality, and taking into account that an intrinsic electric
dipole is forbidden for the antineutron, the next choice is an electric dipole
that is induced by the nuclear electric field. Recent theoretical works have
shown that a non-negligible electric polarization may be induced in a neutron
by QED vacuum polarization. Assuming this as a possibility, we have used a
simple model to calculate the polarization strengths that are needed to fit the
available data in terms of this effect. These are within the magnitude
predicted by the vacuum polarization model. We have also discussed alternative
scenarios that could induce an electric polarization of the antineutron as a
consequence of the interplay between strong and e.m. interactions.

is concentrated on metric sphere of zero radius --- light-cone of Minkowski
space-time, we deduce the analog of Coulomb's law for hyperbolic space-time
field universally acting between the events of space-time. Collective field
that enables interaction of world lines of a pair of particles at rest contains
a standard 3-dimensional Coulomb's part and logarithmic addendum. We've found
that the Coulomb's part depends on a fine balance between causal and geometric
space-time characteristics (the two regularizations concordance).
