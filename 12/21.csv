energy dominates the mass/energy budget of the Universe. A manifestation of
this effect is that in such a cosmology the turnaround radius has an upper
bound. Recently, a new, local, test for the existence of dark energy in the
form of a cosmological constant was proposed based on this turnaround bound.
Before designing an experiment that, through high-precision determination of
masses and turnaround radii, will challenge $\Lambda$CDM cosmology, we have to
answer two important questions: first, when turnaround-scale structures are
predicted to be close enough to their maximum size, so that a possible
violation of the bound may be observable. Second, which is the best mass scale
to target for possible violations of the bound. Using the Press-Schechter
formalism, we find that turnaround structures have in practice already stopped
forming, and consequently, the turnaround radius of structures must be very
close to the maximum value today. We also find that the mass scale of $\sim
10^{13} M_\odot$ characterizes turnaround structures that start to form in a
statistically important number density today. This mass scale also separates
turnaround structures with different cosmological evolution: smaller structures
are no longer readjusting their mass distribution inside the turnaround scale,
they asymptotically approach their ultimate abundance from higher values, and
they are common enough to have, at some epoch, experienced major mergers with
structures of comparable mass; larger structures exhibit the opposite behavior.
We call this mass scale the transitional mass scale and we argue that it is the
optimal for the purpose outlined above. As a corollary result, we explain the
different accretion behavior of small and larger structures observed in already
conducted numerical simulations.

that preserves the symmetry of $D_4$, the point group of a square, we explore,
within the Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov mean-field theory, the phase competition
among density wave orderings and superfluid pairings. We construct the matrix
representation of the linearized gap equation in the irreducible
representations of $D_4$. We show that in the weak coupling regime, each matrix
element, which is a four-dimensional (4D) integral in momentum space, can be
put in a separable form involving a 1D integral, which is only a function of
temperature and the chemical potential, and a pairing-specific ""effective""
interaction, which is an analytical function of the parameters that
characterize the Fermi-Fermi interactions in our system. We analyze the
critical temperatures of various competing orders as functions of different
system parameters in both the absence and presence of the dipolar interaction.
We find that close to half filling, the d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}-wave pairing with a
critical temperature in the order of a fraction of Fermi energy (at half
filling) may dominate all other phases, and at a higher filling factor, the
p-wave pairing with a critical temperature in the order of a hundredth of Fermi
energy may emerge as a winner. We find that tuning a dipolar interaction can
dramatically enhance the pairings with $d_{xy}$- and g-wave symmetries but not
enough for them to dominate other competing phases.

corresponding channel estimation technique are studied in this paper.
Particularly, a $4-$hop network coding transmission strategy is presented
first, followed by an extension strategy for the arbitrary $2N-$hop scenario
($N\geq 2$). The linear minimum mean square error (LMMSE) and
maximum-likelihood (ML) channel estimation methods are designed to improve the
transmission quality in MH-WCNs. Closed form expressions in terms of the mean

allows the design of the optimal training sequence. Unlike the LMMSE method, it
is difficult to obtain closed-form MSE expressions for the nonlinear ML channel
estimation method. In order to accomplish optimal training sequence design for
the ML method, the Cram\'{e}r-Rao lower bound (CRLB) is employed. Numerical
results are provided to corroborate the proposed analysis, and the results

Multiplexing (OFDM) is a promising transmission scheme for high performance
broadband wireless communications. However, this technique suffers from a major
drawback which is the high Peak to Average Power Ratio (PAPR) of the output
signals. In order to overcome this issue, several methods that require the
transmission of explicit Side Information (SI) bits have been proposed. In
fact, the transmitted bits must be channel-encoded as they are particularly
critical to the performance of the considered OFDM system. This
channel-encoding highly increases the system complexity and also decreases the
transmission data rate. For these reasons, we propose in this paper, two robust
blind techniques that embed the (SI) implicitly into the OFDM frame. First, we
investigate a new technique referred as Blind Space Time Bloc Codes (BSTBC)
that is inspired from the conventional Selected Mapping (SLM) approach. This
technique banks on an adequate embedded signaling that mainly consist on a
specific Space Time Bloc Codes (STBC) patterns and a precoding sequences
codebook. Second, in order to improve the signal detection process and the PAPR
gain, we propose a new efficient combined Blind SLM-STBC (BSLM-STBC) method.
Both methods have the benefit of resulting in an optimized scheme during the
signal estimation process that is based on the Max-Log-Maximum A Posteriori
(MAP) algorithm. Finally, the obtained performance evaluation results show that
our proposed methods result in a spectacular PAPR reduction and furthermore
lead to a perfect signal recovery at the receiver side.

each other for their well being. In recent times the research community has
shown significant interest in modeling such interdependent networks and
studying the impact of failures on these networks. Although a number of models
have been proposed, many of them are simplistic in nature and fail to capture
the complex interdependencies that exist between the entities of these
networks. To overcome the limitations, recently an Implicative Interdependency
Model that utilizes Boolean Logic, was proposed and a number of problems were
studied. In this paper we study the entity hardening problem, where by entity
hardening we imply the ability of the network operator to ensure that an
adversary (be it Nature or human) cannot take a network entity from operative
to inoperative state. Given that the network operator with a limited budget can
only harden k entities, the goal of the entity hardening problem is to identify
the set of k entities whose hardening will ensure maximum benefit for the
operator, i.e. maximally reduce the ability of the adversary to degrade the
network. We show that the problem is solvable in polynomial time for some
cases, whereas for others it is NP-complete. We provide the optimal solution
using ILP, and propose a heuristic approach to solve the problem. We evaluate
the efficacy of our heuristic using power and communication network data of
Maricopa County, Arizona. The experiments show that our heuristic almost always
produces near optimal results.

encoded in the timing between events. Recently, the use of the timing channel
has been proposed as a countermeasure to reactive jamming attacks performed by
an energy-constrained malicious node. In fact, whilst a jammer is able to
disrupt the information contained in the attacked packets, timing information
cannot be jammed and, therefore, timing channels can be exploited to deliver
information to the receiver even on a jammed channel.
  Since the nodes under attack and the jammer have conflicting interests, their
interactions can be modeled by means of game theory. Accordingly, in this paper
a game-theoretic model of the interactions between nodes exploiting the timing
channel to achieve resilience to jamming attacks and a jammer is derived and
analyzed. More specifically, the Nash equilibrium is studied in the terms of
existence, uniqueness, and convergence under best response dynamics.
Furthermore, the case in which the communication nodes set their strategy and
the jammer reacts accordingly is modeled and analyzed as a Stackelberg game, by
considering both perfect and imperfect knowledge of the jammer's utility
function. Extensive numerical results are presented, showing the impact of
network parameters on the system performance.

admixture in modern humans. These methods study the pattern of allele sharing
among modern and archaic genomes. They are sensitive to ""ghost"" admixture,
which occurs when a population receives archaic DNA from sources not
acknowledged by the statistical model. The effect of ghost admixture depends on
two factors: branch-length bias and population-size bias. Branch-length bias
occurs because a given amount of admixture has a larger effect if the two
populations have been separated for a long time. Population-size bias occurs
because differences in population size distort branch lengths in the gene
genealogy. In the absence of ghost admixture, these effects are small. They
become important, however, in the presence of ghost admixture. Estimators
differ in the pattern of response. Increasing a given parameter may inflate one
estimator but deflate another. For this reason, comparisons among estimators
are informative. Using such comparisons, this article supports previous
findings that the archaic population was small and that Europeans received
little gene flow from archaic populations other than Neanderthals. It also
identifies an inconsistency in estimates of archaic admixture into Melanesia.

First, the theoretical prediction of the integral charge asymmetry and its

asymmetry of a given signal, in the presence of some background, is performed
using particle level simulations. Process dependent templates enable to convert
the measured integral charge asymmetry into an estimated mass of the charged

uncertainties determines the full uncertainty of the indirect mass measurement.
This new method applies to all charged current processes at the LHC. In this
article, we demonstrate its effectiveness at extracting the mass of the W

neutralino in case these supersymmetric particles are produced by pair, as a

using Spitzer 24 $\mu$m data for isolated cluster galaxies for which

Cluster ETGs show enhanced specific star formation rates (sSFRs) compared to
cluster galaxies in the local Universe, but have sSFRs more than four times
lower than that of field ETGs at $1 < z < 1.5$. Relative to the late-type
cluster population, isolated ETGs show substantially quenched mean SFRs, yet
still contribute 12% of the overall star formation activity measured in $1 < z

clusters; the fraction of cluster galaxies identified as ETGs increases from
34% to 56% from $z \sim 1.5 \rightarrow 1.25$. While the fraction of cluster
ETGs that are highly star-forming ($\textrm{SFR}\geq26\ M_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$)
drops from 27% to 10% over the same period, their sSFRs are roughly constant.
All these factors taken together suggest that, particularly at $z\gtrsim1.25$,

However, this is not always true; sometimes people cooperate even it is not a
best response to do so. For example, in the Prisoner's Dilemma, people often
cooperate. Are there rules underlying cooperative behavior? In an effort to
answer this question, we propose a new equilibrium concept: perfect cooperative
equilibrium (PCE), and two related variants: max-PCE and cooperative
equilibrium. PCE may help explain players' behavior in games where cooperation
is observed in practice. A player's payoff in a PCE is at least as high as in
any NE. However, a PCE does not always exist. We thus consider {\alpha}-PCE,
where {\alpha} takes into account the degree of cooperation; a PCE is a 0-PCE.
Every game has a Pareto-optimal max-PCE (M-PCE); that is, an {\alpha}-PCE for a
maximum {\alpha}. We show that M-PCE does well at predicting behavior in quite
a few games of interest. We also consider cooperative equilibrium (CE), another
generalization of PCE that takes punishment into account. Interestingly, all
Pareto-optimal M-PCE are CE. We prove that, in 2-player games, a PCE (if it
exists), a M-PCE, and a CE can all be found in polynomial time using bilinear
programming. This is a contrast to Nash equilibrium, which is PPAD complete
even in 2-player games [Chen, Deng, and Teng 2009]. We compare M-PCE to the
coco value [Kalai and Kalai 2009], another solution concept that tries to
capture cooperation, both axiomatically and in terms of an algebraic
characterization, and show that the two are closely related, despite their very
different definitions.

number space-time density. Unlike previous relativistically invariant models,
the vacuum state is not excited. The collapse dynamics depends upon two
parameters, a parameter $\Lambda$ which represents the collapse rate/volume and
a scale factor $\ell$. A common example of collapse dynamics, involving a clump

estimation tasks, where parametric dictionaries (PDs) collect signal
observations for a sampling of the parameter space and yield sparse
representations for signals of interest when the sampling is dense. While this
sampling also leads to high dictionary coherence, one can leverage structured
sparsity models to prevent highly coherent dictionary elements from appearing
simultaneously in the recovered signal. However, the resulting approaches
depend heavily on the careful setting of the maximum allowable coherence;
furthermore, their guarantees are not concerned with general parameter
estimation performance. We propose the use of earth mover's distance (EMD), as
applied to a pair of true and estimated PD coefficient vectors, to measure the
parameter estimation error. We formally analyze the connection between the EMD
and the parameter estimation error and show that the EMD provides a
better-suited metric for parameter estimation performance than the Euclidean
distance. Additionally, we analyze the previously described relationship
between K-median clustering and EMD-optimal sparse approximation and leverage
it to develop improved PD-based parameter estimation algorithms. Finally, our
numerical experiments verify our theoretical results and show that the proposed
compressive parameter estimation algorithms have improved performance over
existing approaches.

which have been monitored almost exclusively at infrared wavelengths, where
variability amplitudes greater than 10% have been found to be very rare. We
detect highly significant variability in two T dwarfs. The T2.5 dwarf 2MASS
13243559+6358284 shows consistent ~17% variability on two consecutive nights.
The T2 dwarf 2MASS J16291840+0335371 exhibits ~10% variability that may evolve

known to be variable in the infrared, but with considerably lower amplitudes.

since it has lower significance, we conservatively refrain from claiming this
object as a variable. We explore and rule out various telluric effects,
demonstrating that the variations we detect are astrophysically real. We
suggest that high-amplitude photometric variability for T dwarfs is likely more
common in the red optical than at longer wavelengths. The two new members of

the situation in which financial institutions break up large trades into many
small ones. Dual representation results are also obtained. We give many
practical examples of risk measures and derive for each of them the respective

single-antenna user equipments (UEs) simultaneously. Uplink training with pilot
reusing is adopted to acquire the channel state information (CSI) and maximum
ratio combining (MRC) or zero forcing (ZF) reception is used for handling
multiuser interference. Leveraging stochastic geometry to model the spatial
distribution of UEs, we analyze the statistical distributions of the
interferences experienced by a typical uplink: intra-cell interference,
inter-cell interference and interference due to pilot contamination.
  For a practical but still large number of BS antennas, a key observation for
MRC reception is that it is the intra-cell interference that accounts for the
dominant portion of the total interference. In addition, the interference due
to pilot contamination tends to have a much wider distribution range than the
inter-cell interference when shadowing is strong, although their mean powers
are roughly equal. For ZF reception, on the other hand, we observe a
significant reduction of the intra-cell interference compared to MRC reception,
while the inter-cell interference and the interference due to pilot
contamination remains almost the same, thus demonstrating a substantial
superiority over MRC reception.

(ANN), graph embeddings and sparse representations, I develop a novel
technique, termed SENNS (Sparse Extraction Neural NetworkS), aimed at
addressing the feature extraction problem. The proposed method uses (preferably
deep) ANNs for projecting input attribute vectors to an output space wherein
pairwise distances are maximized for vectors belonging to different classes,
but minimized for those belonging to the same class, while simultaneously
enforcing sparsity on the ANN outputs. The vectors that result from the
projection can then be used as features in any classifier of choice.
Mathematically, I formulate the proposed method as the minimisation of an
objective function which can be interpreted, in the ANN output space, as a
negative factor of the sum of the squares of the pair-wise distances between
output vectors belonging to different classes, added to a positive factor of
the sum of squares of the pair-wise distances between output vectors belonging
to the same classes, plus sparsity and weight decay terms. To derive an
algorithm for minimizing the objective function via gradient descent, I use the
multi-variate version of the chain rule to obtain the partial derivatives of
the function with respect to ANN weights and biases, and find that each of the
required partial derivatives can be expressed as a sum of six terms. As it
turns out, four of those six terms can be computed using the standard back
propagation algorithm; the fifth can be computed via a slight modification of
the standard backpropagation algorithm; while the sixth one can be computed via
simple arithmetic. Finally, I propose experiments on the ARABASE Arabic corpora

eigenvector rows are discarded 2). PCA without discarding eigen- vector rows
preserves pair-wise distances, but tends to cause pair-wise distances to shrink
when eigenvector rows are discarded. 3). For any pair of points, the shrinkage
in pair-wise distance is bounded above by an L1 norm reconstruction error
associated with the points. Clearly, 3). suggests that there might exist some
correlation between shrinkages in pair-wise distances and mean square
reconstruction error which is defined as the sum of those eigenvalues
associated with the discarded eigenvectors. I therefore decided to perform
numerical experiments to obtain the corre- lation between the sum of those
eigenvalues and shrinkages in pair-wise distances. In addition, I have also
performed some experiments to check respectively the effect of the sum of those

temporal-based predictor (TBP). The TBP predicts the future trend by the node
strength in the weighted network with the link weight equal to its exponential

of the new method. We find that TBP have high general accuracy in predicting
the future most popular nodes. More importantly, it can identify many potential

on the famous shape contexts (SC) framework. Our proposals derive from the
observation that the SC framework enforces a one-to-one correspondence between
sample points, and that this leads to two possible drawbacks. First, this
denies the framework the opportunity to effect advantageous many-to-many
matching between points on the two shapes being compared. Second, this calls
for the Hungarian algorithm which unfortunately usurps cubic time. While the
dynamic-space-warping dynamic programming algorithm has provided a standard
solution to the first problem above, it demands quintic time for general
multi-contour shapes, and w times quadratic time for the special case of
single-contour shapes, even after an heuristic search window of width w has
been chosen. Therefore, in this work, we propose a simple method for computing
""many-to-many"" correspondences for the class of all 2-d shapes in quadratic
time. Our approach is to explicitly let each point on the first shape choose a
best match on the second shape, and vice versa. Along the way, we also propose
the use of data-clustering techniques for dealing with the outliers problem,
and, from another viewpoint, it turns out that this clustering can be seen as
an autonomous, rather than pre-computed, sampling of shape boundary.

vector instruction set and an out-of-order engine dedicated to increase the
instruction level parallelism. Hence, related optimizations are currently
critical to improve the performance of applications requiring numerical
computation. Moreover, the use of a Java run-time environment such as the
HotSpot Java Virtual Machine (JVM) in high performance computing is a promising
alternative. It benefits from its programming flexibility, productivity and the
performance is ensured by the Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler. Though, the JIT
compiler suffers from two main drawbacks. First, the JIT is a black box for
developers. We have no control over the generated code nor any feedback from
its optimization phases like vectorization. Secondly, the time constraint
narrows down the degree of optimization compared to static compilers like GCC
or LLVM. So, it is compelling to use statically compiled code since it benefits
from additional optimization reducing performance bottlenecks. Java enables to
call native code from dynamic libraries through the Java Native Interface
(JNI). Nevertheless, JNI methods are not inlined and require an additional cost
to be invoked compared to Java ones. Therefore, to benefit from better static
optimization, this call overhead must be leveraged by the amount of computation
performed at each JNI invocation. In this paper we tackle this problem and we
propose to do this analysis for a set of micro-kernels. Our goal is to select
the most efficient implementation considering the amount of computation defined
by the calling context. We also investigate the impact on performance of
several different optimization schemes which are vectorization, out-of-order
optimization, data alignment, method inlining and the use of native memory for
JNI methods.

evolutionary and a breeding perspective. For plant traits heritability is
traditionally estimated by comparing within and between genotype variability.
This approach estimates broad-sense heritability, and does not account for
different genetic relatedness. With the availability of high-density markers
there is growing interest in marker based estimates of narrow-sense
heritability, using mixed models in which genetic relatedness is estimated from
genetic markers. Such estimates have received much attention in human genetics
but are rarely reported for plant traits. A major obstacle is that current
methodology and software assume a single phenotypic value per genotype, hence
requiring genotypic means. An alternative that we propose here, is to use mixed
models at individual plant or plot level. Using statistical arguments,
simulations and real data we investigate the feasibility of both approaches,
and how these affect genomic prediction with G-BLUP and genome-wide association
studies. Heritability estimates obtained from genotypic means had very large
standard errors and were sometimes biologically unrealistic. Mixed models at
individual plant or plot level produced more realistic estimates, and for
simulated traits standard errors were up to 13 times smaller. Genomic
prediction was also improved by using these mixed models, with up to a 49%
increase in accuracy. For GWAS on simulated traits, the use of individual plant
data gave almost no increase in power. The new methodology is applicable to any
complex trait where multiple replicates of individual genotypes can be scored.
This includes important agronomic crops, as well as bacteria and fungi.

aspects of Computational Logic. These concepts play a key role in the the
interpretation of proofs as programs, a.k.a. the Curry-Howard correspondence,
in the context of classical logic. Arising from linear logic, they allow the
construction of meaningful semantics for cut-elimination in classical logic,
some of which relate to the Call-by-Name and Call-by-Value disciplines of
functional programming. The first part of this dissertation provides an
introduction to these interpretations, highlighting the roles of polarities and
focussing. For instance: proofs of positive formulae provide structured data,
while proofs of negative formulae consume such data; focussing allows the
description of the interaction between the two kinds of proofs as pure
pattern-matching. This idea is pushed further in the second part of this
dissertation, and connected to realisability semantics, where the structured
data is interpreted algebraically, and the consumption of such data is modelled
with the use of an orthogonality relation. Most of this part has been proved in
the Coq proof assistant. Polarities and focussing were also introduced with
applications to logic programming in mind, where computation is proof-search.
In the third part of this dissertation, we push this idea further by exploring
the roles that these concepts can play in other applications of proof-search,
such as theorem proving and more particularly automated reasoning. We use these
concepts to describe the main algorithm of SAT-solvers and SMT-solvers: DPLL.
We then describe the implementation of a proof-search engine called Psyche. Its
architecture, based on the concept of focussing, offers a platform where smart
techniques from automated reasoning (or a user interface) can safely and
trustworthily be implemented via the use of an API.

establish a general gradient formalism that allows to represent linear

result generalizes the well-known Euclidean gradient structures of consensus to
general Riemannian ones. We also find natural non-linear consensus dynamics
differing only from linearity by a different Riemannian structure, sharing a

of quantum states and their self-similar properties. It consists of three
connected threads of research: polynomial invariants for multiphoton states,
visualization schemes for quantum many-body systems and a complex networks
approach to quantum walks on a graph.
  First, we study the problem of which many-photon states are equivalent up to
the action of passive linear optics. We prove that it can be converted into the
problem of equivalence of two permutation-symmetric states, not necessarily
restricted to the same operation on all parties. We show that the problem can
be formulated in terms of symmetries of complex polynomials of many variables,
and provide two families of invariants, which are straightforward to compute
and provide analytical results.
  Second, we study a family of recursive visualization schemes for
many-particle systems, for which we have coined the name 'qubism'. While all
many-qudit states can be plotted with qubism, it is especially useful for spin
chains and one-dimensional translationally invariant states. This symmetry
results in self-similarity of the plot, making it more comprehensible and
allowing to discover certain structures.
  Third, we study quantum walks of a single particle on graphs, which are
classical analogues of random walks. Our focus is on the long-time limit of the
probability distribution and we study how (especially in the long-time limit)
off-diagonal elements of the density matrix behave. We use them to perform
quantum community detection - splitting of a graph into subgraphs in such a way
that the coherence between them is small. Our method captures properties that
classical methods cannot - the impact of constructive and destructive
interference, as well as the dependence of the results on the tunneling phase.

accuracy. On example of the wind-reanalysis data and the results of numerical
modeling of wind-wave heights in the Indian Ocean for the period 1980-2010, the
proposed method was applied to obtain estimates of the return values at a

an aqueous bulk reservoir. We analyze the consequences that follow from the
interplay between surface charge disorder, dielectric and salt image effects,
and the strong electrostatic coupling that results from multivalent counterions
on the distribution of these ions and the effective interaction pressure they
mediate between the surfaces. In a dielectrically homogeneous system, we show
that the multivalent counterions are attracted towards the surfaces with a
singular, disorder-induced potential that diverges logarithmically on approach
to the surfaces, creating a singular counterion density profile with an
algebraic divergence at the surfaces. This effect drives the system towards a
state of lower thermal ""disorder"", one that can be described by a renormalized
temperature, exhibiting thus a remarkable antifragility. The interaction
pressure acting on the surfaces displays in general a highly non-monotonic
behavior as a function of the inter-surface separation with a prominent regime
of attraction at small to intermediate separations. This attraction is caused
directly by the combined effects from charge disorder and strong coupling
electrostatics of multivalent counterions, which can be quite significant even
with a small degree of surface charge disorder relative to the mean surface
charge. The strong coupling, disorder-induced attraction is typically far more
stronger than the van der Waals interaction between the surfaces, especially
within a range of several nanometers for the inter-surface separation.

microbiome is essential in understanding its role in human disease and health.
However, current studies usually overlook a complex and interconnected
landscape of human microbiome and limit the ability in particular body habitats
with learning models of specific criterion. Therefore, these methods could not
capture the real-world underlying microbial patterns effectively. To obtain a
comprehensive view, we propose a novel ensemble clustering framework to mine
the structure of microbial community pattern on large-scale metagenomic data.
Particularly, we first build a microbial similarity network via integrating
1920 metagenomic samples from three body habitats of healthy adults. Then a
novel symmetric Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (NMF) based ensemble model is
proposed and applied onto the network to detect clustering pattern. Extensive
experiments are conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of our model on
deriving microbial community with respect to body habitat and host gender. From
clustering results, we observed that body habitat exhibits a strong bound but
non-unique microbial structural patterns. Meanwhile, human microbiome reveals
different degree of structural variations over body habitat and host gender. In
summary, our ensemble clustering framework could efficiently explore integrated
clustering results to accurately identify microbial communities, and provide a
comprehensive view for a set of microbial communities. Such trends depict an
integrated biography of microbial communities, which offer a new insight
towards uncovering pathogenic model of human microbiome.

precoding for the downlink of Cloud Radio Access Networks (C-RANs). In a C-RAN,
a central unit (CU) performs the baseband processing for a cluster of radio
units (RUs) that receive compressed baseband samples from the CU through
low-latency fronthaul links. Most previous works on the design of fronthaul
compression and precoding assume constant channels and instantaneous channel
state information (CSI) at the CU. This work, in contrast, concentrates on a
more practical scenario with block-ergodic channels and considers either
instantaneous or stochastic CSI at the CU. Moreover, the analysis encompasses
both the Compression-After-Precoding (CAP) and the Compression-Before-Precoding
(CBP) schemes. With the CAP approach, which is the standard C-RAN solution, the
CU performs channel coding and precoding and then the CU compresses and
forwards the resulting baseband signals on the fronthaul links to the RUs. With
the CBP scheme, instead, the CU does not perform precoding but rather forwards
separately the information messages of a subset of mobile stations (MSs) along
with the compressed precoding matrices to the each RU, which then performs
precoding. Optimization algorithms over fronthaul compression and precoding for
both CAP and CBP are proposed that are based on a stochastic successive
upper-bound minimization approach. Via numerical results, the relative merits
of the two strategies under either instantaneous or stochastic CSI are
evaluated as a function of system parameters such as fronthaul capacity and
channel coherence time.

the modified Green operator leads, in all systems investigated, to more
accurate strain and stress fields than using the discretizations proposed by
Moulinec and Suquet (1994) or Willot and Pellegrini (2008). Moreover, we
compared the convergence rates of the ""direct"" and ""accelerated"" FFT schemes
with the different discretizations. The discretization method proposed in this
work allows for much faster FFT schemes with respect to two criteria: stress
equilibrium and effective elastic moduli.

probabilistic finite state machine capable of generating statistically
identical symbol sequences to samples provided. This problem is qualitatively
similar to the classical Hidden Markov Model problem and has been studied from
a practical point of view in several works beginning with the work presented
in: Shalizi, C.R., Shalizi, K.L., Crutchfield, J.P. (2002) \textit{An algorithm
for pattern discovery in time series.} Technical Report 02-10-060, Santa Fe
Institute. arxiv.org/abs/cs.LG/0210025. We show that the underlying problem is
$\mathrm{NP}$-hard and thus all existing polynomial time algorithms must be
approximations on finite data sets. Using our $\mathrm{NP}$-hardness proof, we
show how to construct a provably correct algorithm for constructing a minimum
state probabilistic finite state machine given data and empirically study its
running time.

establish new three-level and multilevel finite element discretizations by
local defect-correction technique. Theoretical analysis and numerical
experiments show that the schemes are simple and easy to carry out, and can be
used to solve singular nonsymmetric eigenvalue problems efficiently. We also
discuss the local error estimates of finite element approximations; it's a new
feature here that the estimates apply to the local domains containing corner
points.

  admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:1205.4705",,,,"q-bio.BM q-bio.QM","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We present a dual optimization concept of predicting optimal sequences as
well as optimal folds of off-lattice protein models in the context of
multi-scale modeling. We validate the utility of the recently introduced
hidden-force Monte Carlo optimization algorithm by finding significantly lower
energy folds for minimalist and detailed protein models than previously
reported. Further, we also find the protein sequence that yields the lowest
energy fold amongst all sequences for a given chain length and residue mixture.
In particular, for protein models with a binary sequence, we show that the
sequence-optimized folds form more compact cores than the lowest energy folds
of the historically fixed, Fibonacci-series sequences of chain lengths of 13,
21, 34, 55, and 89. We then extend our search algorithm to use UNRES, one of
the leading united-residue protein force fields. Our combined fold and sequence
optimization on three test proteins reveal an inherent bias in UNRES favoring
alpha helical structures even when secondary structure prediction clearly
suggests only beta sheets besides random coil, and virtually no helices. One
test in particular, a triple-stranded antiparallel beta-sheet protein domain,
demonstrates that by permutations of its sequence UNRES re-folds this structure
into a perfect alpha helix but, in fact, the helix is just an artefact of the
force field, the structure quickly unfolds in all-atom state-of-the-art
molecular dynamics simulation.

determined threshold that precisely separates signal and non-signal components
in the 2D DFT domain. The algorithm operates fast in a single iteration
providing the accurate signal reconstruction. In the situations that are not
comprised by the analytic derivation and constrains, the algorithm is still
efficient and need just a couple of iterations. The proposed solution shows
promising results in ISAR imaging (simulated data are used), where the
reconstruction is achieved even in the case when less than 10% of data is
available.
