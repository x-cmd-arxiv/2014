is the number of communication rounds. For this reason, there is a growing
interest in single-round multiway join algorithms where data is first
reshuffled over many servers and then evaluated in a parallel but
communication-free way. The reshuffling itself is specified as a distribution
policy. We introduce a correctness condition, called parallel-correctness, for
the evaluation of queries w.r.t. a distribution policy. We study the complexity
of parallel-correctness for conjunctive queries as well as transferability of
parallel-correctness between queries. We also investigate the complexity of
transferability for certain families of distribution policies, including, for
instance, the Hypercube distribution.

feline coronavirus (FCoV) genome that are thought to convert the subclinical
feline enteric coronavirus (FECV) into the lethal feline infectious peritonitis
virus (FIPV). A key feature of FIPV, not shared with FECV, is the productive
infection of macrophages. Therefore mutations in proteins that govern cell
tropism, such as the spike glycoprotein, may play an important role in FIP
progression. In a prior study, involving a limited number of samples, we have
shown an association of FIP with mutations in the protease cleavage-activation
site located between the receptor-binding and fusion domains of the FCoV spike
(S1/S2). Here, we extend these studies to investigate a larger sample set and
to obtain a more refined analysis of the mutations at this S1/S2 site. Our
larger data set more clearly shows that the mutations acquired by FIPV at S1/S2
are also accompanied by additional mutations at a second protease
cleavage-activation site located in the fusion domain (S2'), adjacent to the
viral fusion peptide. Overall, our data indicate a pattern of mutations across
the two protease recognition sites that results in substitutions, and/or
altered recognition, of critical basic/polar amino acid residues needed for
virus activation in the enteric tract. Typically, FIPVs have substitutions of
non-polar, aliphatic or aromatic residues in the protease recognition sites.
These changes likely modulate the proteolytic activation of the virus and its
ability to productively infect macrophages in vivo.

the high-cadence imaging spectroscopy of the Ca II 8542 A line from the

minute period. Most of these RBEs have either a round or elongated shape, with
an average area of 1.2 arcsec^2. The detailed temporal evolution of spectra
from IBIS makes possible a quantitative determination of the velocity (~16

Resorting to a
Gaussian regression framework, we model the impulse response of the unknown
linear system as a realization of a Gaussian process. The structure of the
covariance matrix (or kernel) of such a process is given by the stable spline
kernel, which has been recently introduced for system identification purposes
and depends on an unknown hyperparameter. We assume that the input can be
linearly described by few parameters. We estimate these parameters, together
with the kernel hyperparameter and the noise variance, using an empirical Bayes
approach. The related optimization problem is efficiently solved with a novel
iterative scheme based on the Expectation-Maximization method. In particular,
we show that each iteration consists of a set of simple update rules. We show,
through some numerical experiments, very promising performance of the proposed

that our observations are in good agreement with calculated rates assuming that
red supergiants (RSGs) explode with fiducial radii of 500 solar, explosion
energies of 10^51 erg, and ejecta masses of 10 solar masses. Exploding blue
supergiants and Wolf-Rayet stars are poorly constrained. We describe how such
observations can be used to derive the progenitor radius, surface composition

observations are critical for such measurements. We use the fiducial RSG
parameters to estimate the detection rate of SNe during the shock-cooling phase

show that the proposed wide-field UV explorer ULTRASAT mission, is expected to
find >100 SNe per year (~0.5 SN per deg^2), independent of host galaxy
extinction, down to an NUV detection limit of 21.5 mag AB. Our pilot GALEX/PTF

dependent resistance, called magnetoresistance, has found commercial
applications such as giant magnetoresistance harddisk read heads. But
magnetoresistance can also be a powerful probe of electronic and magnetic
interactions in matter. For example, magnetoresistance can be used to analyze
multiband conductivity, conduction inhomogeneity, localized magnetic moments,
and (fractional) Landau level structure. For materials with strong spin-orbit
interaction, magnetoresistance can be used as a probe for weak antilocalization
or a nontrivial Berry phase, such as in topological insulator surface states.
For the three dimensional topological insulators a large and linear
magnetoresistance is often used as indication for underlying non-trivial
topology, although the origin of this effect has not yet been established.
Here, we observe a large magnetoresistance in the conducting bulk state of
Bi$_2$Te$_3$. We show that this type of large magnetoresistance is due to the
competition between helical spin-momentum locking (i.e. spin rotates with
momentum direction) and the unidirectional spin alignment by an applied
magnetic field. Warping effects are found to provide the (quasi) linear
dependence on magnetic field. We provide a quantitative model for the helicity
breaking induced magnetoresistance that can be applied to a vast range of
materials, surfaces or interfaces with weak to strong spin-orbit interactions,
such as the contemporary oxide interfaces, bulk Rashba systems, and topological
insulator surface states.

constitutes partial progress towards a remainder term which features just the
Petz recovery map (not a rotated Petz map), a conjecture which would have many
consequences in quantum information theory.
  A well known result states that the monotonicity of relative entropy with
respect to quantum operations is equivalent to each of the following
inequalities: strong subadditivity of entropy, concavity of conditional
entropy, joint convexity of relative entropy, and monotonicity of relative
entropy with respect to partial trace. We show that this equivalence holds true

in small many-body systems, can lead to decoherence and hence to
irreversibility when they proliferate as the system size increases. This
question is at the heart of solid state NMR. There, an initially local
polarization spreads all over due to spin-spin interactions that conserve the
total spin projection, leading to an equilibration of the polarization. In
principle, this quantum dynamics can be reversed by changing the sign of the
Hamiltonian. However, the reversal is usually perturbed by non reversible
interactions that act as a decoherence source. The fraction of the local
excitation recovered defines the Loschmidt echo (LE), here evaluated in a
series of closed $N$ spin systems with all-to-all interactions. The most
remarkable regime of the LE decay occurs when the perturbation induces
proliferated effective interactions. We show that if this perturbation exceeds
some lower bound, the decay is ruled by an effective Fermi golden rule (FGR).
Such a lower bound shrinks as $ N $ increases, becoming the leading mechanism
for LE decay in the thermodynamic limit. Once the polarization stayed
equilibrated longer than the FGR time, it remains equilibrated in spite of the
reversal procedure.

consideration to trigger quasar activities. Second, satellites in very massive
halos at low redshift are removed from consideration, due to their deficiency
of cold gas. We analyze the {\em Millennium Simulation} to find halos that meet
these two conditions and simultaneously match two-point auto-correlation
functions of quasars and cross-correlation functions between quasars and
galaxies at $z=0.5-3.2$. %The found halos have some distinct properties worth
noting. The masses of found quasar hosts decrease with decreasing redshift,
with the mass thresholds being $[(2-5)\times 10^{12}, (2-5)\times 10^{11},
(1-3)\times 10^{11}]\msun$ for median luminosities of $\sim[10^{46}, 10^{46},
10^{45}]$erg/s at $z=(3.2, 1.4, 0.53)$, respectively, an order of magnitude
lower than those inferred based on halo occupation distribution modeling. In
this model quasar hosts are primarily massive central halos at $z\ge 2-3$ but
increasingly dominated by lower mass satellite halos experiencing major
interactions towards lower redshift. But below $z=1$ satellite halos in groups
more massive than $\sim 2\times 10^{13}\msun$ do not host quasars. Whether for
central or satellite halos, imposing the condition of significant interactions
substantially boosts the clustering strength compared to the total population
with the same mass cut. The inferred lifetimes of quasars at $z=0.5-3.2$ of
$3-30$Myr are in agreement with observations. Quasars at $z\sim 2$ would be
hosted by halos of mass $\sim 5\times 10^{11}\msun$ in this model, compared to
$\sim 3\times 10^{12}\msun$ previously thought, which would help reconcile with

  trees","37 pages, 8 figures",,,,"q-bio.PE cs.CE cs.DS math.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Within the field of phylogenetics there is great interest in distance
measures to quantify the dissimilarity of two trees. Recently, a new distance
measure has been proposed: the Maximum Parsimony (MP) distance. This is based
on the difference of the parsimony scores of a single character on both trees
under consideration, and the goal is to find the character which maximizes this
difference. Here we show that computation of MP distance on two \emph{binary}
phylogenetic trees is NP-hard. This is a highly nontrivial extension of an
earlier NP-hardness proof for two multifurcating phylogenetic trees, and it is
particularly relevant given the prominence of binary trees in the phylogenetics
literature. As a corollary to the main hardness result we show that computation
of MP distance is also hard on binary trees if the number of states available
is bounded. In fact, via a different reduction we show that it is hard even if
only two states are available. Finally, as a first response to this hardness we
give a simple Integer Linear Program (ILP) formulation which is capable of
computing the MP distance exactly for small trees (and for larger trees when
only a small number of character states are available) and which is used to
computationally verify several auxiliary results required by the hardness
proofs.

momentum and gravitational-wave memory effects in general relativity. In this
paper, we investigate local properties of this transport equation in greater
detail. Associated with this transport equation is a map between the tangent
spaces at two points on a curve. This map consists of a homogeneous (linear)
part given by the parallel transport map along the curve plus an inhomogeneous
part, which is related to the development of a curve in a manifold into an
affine tangent space. For closed curves, the affine transport equation defines
a ""generalized holonomy"" that takes the form of an affine map on the tangent
space. We explore the local properties of this generalized holonomy by using
covariant bitensor methods to compute the generalized holonomy around geodesic
polygon loops. We focus on triangles and ""parallelogramoids"" with sides formed
from geodesic segments. For small loops, we recover the well-known result for
the leading-order linear holonomy ($\sim$ Riemann $\times$ area), and we derive
the leading-order inhomogeneous part of the generalized holonomy ($\sim$
Riemann $\times$ area$^{3/2}$). Our bitensor methods let us naturally compute
higher-order corrections to these leading results. These corrections reveal the
form of the finite-size effects that enter into the holonomy for larger loops;
they could also provide quantitative errors on the leading-order results for
finite loops.

modeling approach is to write a Bayesian hierarchical model for the lensed CMB

no feasible algorithm for inferring the posterior distribution of the lensing

Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling from the joint posterior of the lensing

The main conceptual step in the solution is a re-parameterization of CMB
lensing in terms of the lensed CMB and the ""inverse lensing"" potential. We
demonstrate a fast implementation on simulated data including noise and a sky
cut, that uses a further acceleration based on a very mild approximation of the
inverse lensing potential. We find that the resulting Markov Chain has short
correlation lengths and excellent convergence properties, making it promising
for application to high resolution CMB data sets of the future.

some small computational effort to locate inactive atoms and remove them from
the dictionary in a preprocessing stage so that the regression algorithm
working with a smaller dictionary will then converge faster to the solution of
the initial problem. We believe that there is an even more efficient way to
screen the dictionary and obtain a greater acceleration: inside each iteration
of the regression algorithm, one may take advantage of the algorithm
computations to obtain a new screening test for free with increasing screening
effects along the iterations. The dictionary is henceforth dynamically screened
instead of being screened statically, once and for all, before the first
iteration. We formalize this dynamic screening principle in a general
algorithmic scheme and apply it by embedding inside a number of first-order
algorithms adapted existing screening tests to solve the Lasso or new screening
tests to solve the Group-Lasso. Computational gains are assessed in a large set
of experiments on synthetic data as well as real-world sounds and images. They
show both the screening efficiency and the gain in terms running times.

regulation, the scientific qualification for a specific role (associate or full

position. The ASN is peculiar since it makes use of bibliometric indicators
with associated thresholds as one of the parameters used to assess applicants.
Overall, more than 59000 applications were submitted, and the results have been
made publicly available for a short period of time, including the values of the
quantitative indicators for each applicant. The availability of this wealth of
information provides an opportunity to draw a fairly detailed picture of a
nation-wide evaluation exercise, and to study the impact of the bibliometric
indicators on the qualification results. In this paper we provide a first

poorly understood. We analyse three published outburst light curves of two
transient VFXBs using the exponential and linear decay formalism of King and
Ritter (1998). The decay timescales and brink luminosities suggest orbital
periods of order 1 hour. We review various estimates of VFXB properties, and
compare these with suggested explanations of the nature of VFXBs. We suggest
that: 1) VFXB outbursts showing linear decays might be explained as partial
drainings of the disc of ""normal"" X-ray transients, and many VFXB outbursts may
belong to this category; 2) VFXB outbursts showing exponential decays are best
explained by old, short-period systems involving mass transfer from a low-mass
white dwarf or brown dwarf; 3) persistent (or quasi-persistent) VFXBs, which
maintain an Lx of 10^34-10^35 erg/s for years, may be explained by
magnetospheric choking of the accretion flow in a propeller effect, permitting
a small portion of the flow to accrete onto the neutron star's surface. We thus
predict that (quasi-)persistent VFXBs may also be transitional millisecond

calculated from the joint neighborhood graph, followed by embedding into and
matching in a common low-dimensional Euclidean space. Compared to existing

Simplices are geometric structures that generalize triangles. We give a simple
geometric understanding that allows us to learn a simplicial structure
efficiently. Our method requires that the data are unit normalized (and thus
lie on the unit sphere). We show that under this restriction, building a model
with simplices amounts to constructing a convex hull inside the sphere whose
boundary facets is close to the data. We call the boundary facets of the convex
hull that are close to the data Activated Simplices. While the total number of
bases used to build the simplices is a parameter of the model, the dimensions
of the individual activated simplices are learned from the data. Simplices can
have different dimensions, which facilitates modeling of inhomogeneous data
sources. The simplicial structure is bounded --- this is appropriate for
modeling data with constraints, such as human elbows can not bend more than 180
degrees. The simplices are easy to interpret and extremes within the data can
be discovered among the vertices. The method provides good reconstruction and
regularization. It supports good nearest neighbor classification and it allows
realistic generative models to be constructed. It achieves state-of-the-art
results on benchmark datasets, including 3D poses and digits.

confirm the basic properties of long-period oscillations of sunspots that have
previously been established and also reveal new properties. We show that the
limiting (lowest) eigenmode of low-frequency oscillations of a sunspot as a
whole is the mode with a period of 10 - 12 up to 32 - 35 hours (depending on
the sunspot's magnetic- field strength). This mode is observed consistently
throughout the observation period 5 - 7 days, but its amplitude is subject to
quasi-cyclic changes, which are separated by about 1.5 - 2 days. As a result,
the lower mode with periods of about 35 - 48 hours appears in the power
spectrum of sunspot oscillations. But this lowest mode is apparently not an
eigenmode of a sunspot because its period does not depend on the magnetic field
of the sunspot. Perhaps, the mode reflects the quasi-periodic sunspot
perturbations caused by supergranulation cells that surround it. We also
analyze SOHO/MDI artifacts, which may affect the low-frequency power spectra of
sunspots.

high resolution spectra obtained with the Michigan/Magellan Fiber System (M2FS)

heliocentric radial velocity and [Fe/H] values to be <RV_helio.>=-18.56 km s^-1

agreement with previous literature estimates. The average [Na/Fe] abundance is
0.12 dex lower in the 47 Tuc AGB sample compared to the RGB sample, and the
ratio of Na-poor to Na-rich stars is 63:37 on the AGB and 45:55 on the RGB.
However, in contrast to NGC 6752, the two 47 Tuc populations have nearly
identical [Na/Fe] dispersion and interquartile range values. The data presented
here suggest that only a small fraction <20% of Na-rich stars in 47 Tuc may
fail to ascend the AGB. Regardless of the cause for the lower average [Na/Fe]
abundance in AGB stars, we find that Na-poor stars and at least some Na-rich
stars in 47 Tuc evolve through the early AGB phase. [abridged]

bursts is delayed with respect to the low energy emission. However, the
dependence of light curves on energy has not been studied for the high energy
bands. In this paper we consider the bursts observed by Fermi LAT from 2008
August 4 to 2011 August 1, for which at least $10$ photons were observed with
the energy greater than $1\,\text{GeV}$. These include $4$ bursts: GRB 080916C,
GRB 090510, GRB 090902B, and GRB 090926A. We use the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test to
compare the light curves in the two bands, $100\,\text{MeV} < E <
1\,\text{GeV}$ and $E > 1\,\text{GeV}$. For GRB 080916C and GRB 090510 the
light curves in the two bands are statistically compatible. However, for GRB
090926A, the higher-energy light curve is stretched compared to the
lower-energy one with a statistical significance of $3.3 \sigma$ and, for GRB
090902B, on the contrary, the lower-energy curve is stretched with $2.3 \sigma$
significance. We argue that the observed diversity of stretching factors may be
explained in a simple geometrical model. The model assumes that the jet opening
angle depends on the emission energy in a way that the most energetic photons
are radiated near the axis of the jet. All the bursts are considered equivalent
in their rest frames and the observed light curves differ only due to different
redshifts and view directions. The model conforms to the total burst energy
constraint and matches the Fermi LAT observations of the fraction of GRBs
visible in $100\,\text{MeV} < E < 1\,\text{GeV}$ band, which may be observed at
higher energies. The model predicts the distribution of observable stretching
factors, which may be tested in the future data. Finally, we propose a method
to estimate observer's off-axis angle based on the stretching factor and the
fraction of the high-energy photons.

sometimes inferior to conformity. Choosing the most common strategy within the
interaction range is safer because it ensures that the payoff of an individual

humans and social animals also compel to conformity on their own right.
Motivated by these facts, we here study the impact of conformity on the
evolution of cooperation in social dilemmas. We show that an appropriate
fraction of conformists within the population introduces an effective surface
tension around cooperative clusters and ensures smooth interfaces between
different strategy domains. Payoff-driven players brake the symmetry in favor
of cooperation and enable an expansion of clusters past the boundaries imposed
by traditional network reciprocity. This mechanism works even under the most
testing conditions, and it is robust against variations of the interaction
network as long as degree-normalized payoffs are applied. Conformity may thus
be beneficial for the resolution of social dilemmas.

is a very mild but statistically significant radial metallicity gradient. About
60% of the bulge RRab stars form two very close sequences on the
period-amplitude (or Bailey) diagram, which we interpret as two major old bulge
populations: A and B. Their metallicities likely differ. Population A is about
four times less abundant than the slightly more metal-poor population B. Most
of the remaining stars seem to represent other, even more metal-poor
populations of the bulge. The presence of multiple old populations indicates
that the Milky Way bulge was initially formed through mergers.

bulk of ejected 56Ni, consistent with observations. In all of our models inward
mixing of hydrogen during the 3D evolution leads to minimum H-velocities below
100 km/s, in good agreement with spectral observations. The considered BSG
models, 3D explosion simulations, and light-curve calculations can thus explain
basic observational features of SN 1987A. However, all progenitors have too
large pre-SN radii to reproduce the narrow initial luminosity peak, and the
structure of their outer layers is not suitable to match the observed light
curve during the first 30-40 days. Only one stellar model has a structure of
the He core and the He/H composition interface that enables sufficient outward
mixing of 56Ni and inward mixing of hydrogen to produce a good match of the
dome-like shape of the observed light-curve maximum. But this model falls short
of the He-core mass of 6 Msun inferred from the absolute luminosity of the
pre-SN star. The lack of an adequate pre-SN model for SN 1987A is a pressing

energy per decoded bit must approach infinity for any sequence of codes that
approaches capacity. The analysis techniques used are then extended to the case
of serial computation, showing that if a circuit is restricted to serial
computation, then as block length approaches infinity, either the block error
probability is lower bounded by 1/2 or the energy scales at least as fast as
Omega(n log(n)). In a very general case that allows for the number of output

Relativity in the strongly dynamical and non-linear regime. One such foundation
is Lorentz symmetry, which can be broken in the gravitational sector by the
existence of a preferred time direction, and thus, a preferred frame at each
spacetime point. This leads to a modification in the orbital decay rate of
binary systems, and also in the generation and chirping of their associated
gravitational waves. We here study whether waves emitted in the late,
quasi-circular inspiral of non-spinning, neutron star binaries can place
competitive constraints on two proxies of gravitational Lorentz-violation:
Einstein-\AE{}ther theory and khronometric gravity. We model the waves in the
small-coupling (or decoupling) limit and in the post-Newtonian approximation,
by perturbatively solving the field equations in small deformations from
General Relativity and in the small-velocity/weak-gravity approximation. We
assume a gravitational wave consistent with General Relativity has been
detected with second- and third-generation, ground-based detectors, and with
the proposed space-based mission, DECIGO, with and without coincident
electromagnetic counterparts. Without a counterpart, a detection consistent
with General Relativity of neutron star binaries can only place competitive
constraints on gravitational Lorentz violation when using future,
third-generation or space-based instruments. On the other hand, a single
counterpart is enough to place constraints that are 10 orders of magnitude more
stringent than current binary pulsar bounds, even when using second-generation
detectors. This is because Lorentz violation forces the group velocity of
gravitational waves to be different from that of light, and this difference can
be very accurately constrained with coincident observations.

and the MBH-LV correlation has the largest scatter, suggesting it may the the
least fundamental of the three relations. We find Gaussian scatter about all
three relations, except among the highest mass galaxies, which host more
massive black holes. Below z~2 the slopes for the full population remain
roughly z-independent, and only steepen by 50% by z~4. The normalization of the
sigma, LV relations evolve by 0.3, 0.43 dex, while the MBH correlation does not
evolve to at least z~2. Testing for selection biases, we find samples selected
by MBH or M* have steeper slopes than randomly selected samples. If unaccounted
for, such a selection function would find faster evolution than inferred from a
randomly selected sample, as objects at the highend of the relation tend to
evolve more rapidly. We find a potential bias among high-LBH subsamples
(tending to reside in higher mass galaxies), but these bright-AGN exhibit no
intrinsic bias relative to fainter ones in equivalent-mass hosts, nor is there
a significant difference between active- and inactive-samples. Finally we
characterize the evolution of individual black holes along the scaling planes.
Below the local relation, black holes grow faster than their host (72% of black
holes 0.3 dex below the mean relation have a MBH-M* trajectory steeper than the
local relation), while those above have shallower trajectories (only 14% are
steeper than local). Black holes tend to grow faster than their hosts until
surpassing the local relation, at which point their growth is suppressed while
their hosts continue to grow, returning them to the mean relation.

for the dynamics of opinions. Like in the voter model, individuals are located
on the vertex set of a connected graph and update their opinion at a constant
rate based on the opinion of their neighbors. However, unlike in the voter
model, the set of opinions is represented by the set of vertices of another
connected graph that we call the opinion graph: when an individual interacts
with a neighbor, she imitates this neighbor if and only if the distance between
their opinions, defined as the graph distance induced by the opinion graph,
does not exceed a certain confidence threshold. When the confidence threshold
is at least equal to the radius of the opinion graph, we prove that the
one-dimensional process fluctuates and clusters and give a universal lower
bound for the probability of consensus of the process on finite connected
graphs. We also establish a general sufficient condition for fixation of the
infinite system based on the structure of the opinion graph, which we then
significantly improve for opinion graphs which are distance-regular. Our
general results are used to understand the dynamics of the system for various
examples of opinion graphs: paths and stars, which are not distance-regular,
and cycles, hypercubes and the five Platonic solids, which are
distance-regular.

members of $\gamma$ Vel displays a peak at about 10 km s$^{-1}$ with a tail
toward faster rotators. There is also some indication of a different $v\sin i$
distribution for the members of its two kinematical populations. Only a handful
of stars in $\gamma$ Vel display signatures of accretion, while many more
accretors were detected in the younger Cha~I. Accreting and active stars occupy
two different regions in a $T_{\rm eff}$-flux diagram and we propose a
criterion for distinguishing them. We derive $\dot M_{\rm acc}$ in the ranges

correlation between the two luminosities. However, part of this correlation is
due to the redshift or distances of the sources that enter in calculating the
luminosities from the observed fluxes and part of it could be due to the
differences in the cosmological evolution of luminosities. Thus, the
determination of the intrinsic correlations between the luminosities is not
straightforward. It is affected by the observational selection effects and
other factors that truncate the data, sometimes in a complex manner (e.g.
Antonucci (2011) and Pavildou et al. (2010)). In this paper we describe methods
that allow us to determine the evolution of the radio and optical luminosities,

two frameworks for handling the double partial wave expansion of generalized
parton distributions (GPDs) in the conformal partial waves and in the
$t$-channel ${\rm SO}(3)$ partial waves. Within the dual parametrization
framework, GPDs are represented as integral convolutions of forward-like
functions whose Mellin moments generate the conformal moments of GPDs. The
Mellin-Barnes integral approach is based on the analytic continuation of the
GPD conformal moments to the complex values of the conformal spin. GPDs are
then represented as the Mellin-Barnes-type integrals in the complex conformal
spin plane. In this paper we explicitly show the equivalence of these two
independently developed GPD representations. Furthermore, we clarify the
notions of the $J=0$ fixed pole and the $D$-form factor. We also provide some
insight into GPD modeling and map the phenomenologically successful
Kumeri\v{c}ki-M\""uller GPD model to the dual parametrization framework by
presenting the set of the corresponding forward-like functions. We also build
up the reparametrization procedure allowing to recast the double distribution
representation of GPDs in the Mellin-Barnes integral framework and present the
explicit formula for mapping double distributions into the space of double
partial wave amplitudes with complex conformal spin.

diffusion in social networks from a communications/signal processing

social networks together with social sensing via social media networks such as

social learning is considered with applications in finance and online

are utility maximizers and then determine their utility functions. Finally, the
interaction of social sensors with YouTube channel owners is studied using time

for the radial particle motion is almost the same as that in general

are interested in those obtained through limits of a sequence of models which
describe queueing networks. Such a limit is typically obtained by the weak
convergence of either stochastic processes or stationary distributions. We
already have nice reviews and text books for them. However, this area is still
actively studied, and it seems getting hard to have a comprehensive overview
because mathematical results are highly technical. We try to fill this gap
presenting technical background. Although those diffusion approximations have
been well developed, there remains a big problem, which is difficulty to get
useful information from the limiting diffusion processes. Their state spaces
are multidimensional, whose dimension corresponds to the number of nodes for a
single-class case and the number of customer types for a multi-class case. We
now have a better view for the two dimensional case, but still know very little
about the higher dimensional case. This intractability is somehow against a
spirit of diffusion approximation. This motivates us to reconsider diffusion

cardiac analysis. Many approaches have been developed to better estimate the

In this article, using a point-wise approach, we try to estimate the

endocardial and epicardial contour points are ordered with respect to the
center of gravity of the endocardial contour and displacement vectors of
boundary points are extracted. Then to solve the governing equations of the
deformation, which is an elliptic equation, we apply boundary conditions in
accordance with the computed displacement vectors and then the Finite Element
method (FEM) will be used to solve the governing equations. Using the obtained
displacement field of the cardiac muscle, strain map is extracted to show the
mechanical behavior of the cardiac muscle. Several tests are conducted using
phantom and real cardiac data in order to show the validity of the proposed
method.

unsupervised approach to fuse various local descriptors in the space of
homographies. Inspired by the observation that the homographies of correct
feature correspondences vary smoothly along the spatial domain, our approach
stands on the unsupervised nature of feature matching, and can select a good
descriptor for matching each feature point. Specifically, the homography space
serves as the common domain, in which a correspondence obtained by any
descriptor is considered as a point, for integrating various heterogeneous
descriptors. Both geometric coherence and spatial continuity among
correspondences are considered via computing their geodesic distances in the
space. In this way, mutual verification across different descriptors is
allowed, and correct correspondences will be highlighted with a high degree of
consistency (i.e., short geodesic distances here). It follows that one-class
SVM can be applied to identifying these correct correspondences, and boosts the
performance of feature matching. The proposed approach is comprehensively
compared with the state-of-the-art approaches, and evaluated on four benchmarks
of image matching. The promising results manifest its effectiveness.

in standard Jupiter structure and evolution models through the assumption of an
outer, He-depleted envelope that is separated from the He-enriched deep
interior by a sharp boundary. Here we aim to develop a model for Jupiter's
inhomogeneous thermal evolution that relies on a more self-consistent
description of the internal profiles of He abundance, temperature, and heat
flux. We make use of recent numerical simulations on H/He demixing, and on
layered (LDD) and oscillatory (ODD) double diffusive convection, and assume an
idealized planet model composed of a H/He envelope and a massive core. A
general framework for the construction of interior models with He rain is
described. Despite, or perhaps because of, our simplifications made we find
that self-consistent models are rare. For instance, no model for ODD convection
is found. We modify the H/He phase diagram of Lorenzen et al. to reproduce
Jupiter's atmospheric helium abundance and examine evolution models as a
function of the LDD layer height, from those that prolong Jupiter's cooling
time to those that actually shorten it. Resulting models that meet the
luminosity constraint have layer heights of about 0.1-1 km, corresponding to
~10,-20,000 layers in the rain zone between ~1 and 3-4.5 Mbars. Present

train to spike train transformations in multilayer feedforward networks of
spiking neurons. The framework, aimed at seamlessly generalizing error
backpropagation to the deterministic spiking neuron setting, is based strictly
on spike timing and avoids invoking concepts pertaining to spike rates or
probabilistic models of spiking. The derivation is founded on two innovations.
First, an error functional is proposed that compares the spike train emitted by
the output neuron of the network to the desired spike train by way of their
putative impact on a virtual postsynaptic neuron. This formulation sidesteps
the need for spike alignment and leads to closed form solutions for all
quantities of interest. Second, virtual assignment of weights to spikes rather
than synapses enables a perturbation analysis of individual spike times and
synaptic weights of the output as well as all intermediate neurons in the
network, which yields the gradients of the error functional with respect to the
said entities. Learning proceeds via a gradient descent mechanism that
leverages these quantities. Simulation experiments demonstrate the efficacy of
the proposed learning framework. The experiments also highlight asymmetries
between synapses on excitatory and inhibitory neurons.

(ATCA), we obtain spectra for PKS 1718-649, a well-known gigahertz-peaked
spectrum radio source. The observations, between approximately 1 and 10 GHz
over three epochs spanning approximately 21 months, reveal variability both
above the spectral peak at ~3 GHz and below the peak. The combination of the
low and high frequency variability cannot be easily explained using a single
absorption mechanism, such as free-free absorption or synchrotron
self-absorption. We find that the PKS 1718-649 spectrum and its variability are
best explained by variations in the free-free optical depth on our
line-of-sight to the radio source at low frequencies (below the spectral peak)
and the adiabatic expansion of the radio source itself at high frequencies
(above the spectral peak). The optical depth variations are found to be
plausible when X-ray continuum absorption variability seen in samples of Active
Galactic Nuclei is considered. We find that the cause of the peaked spectrum in
PKS 1718-649 is most likely due to free-free absorption. In agreement with
previous studies, we find that the spectrum at each epoch of observation is
best fit by a free-free absorption model characterised by a power-law
distribution of free-free absorbing clouds. This agreement is extended to
frequencies below the 1 GHz lower limit of the ATCA by considering new
observations with Parkes at 725 MHz and 199 MHz observations with the newly
operational Murchison Widefield Array. These lower frequency observations argue
against families of absorption models (both free-free and synchrotron
self-absorption) that are based on simple homogenous structures.

design objective, and mathematically is the probability that a system will
perform satisfactorily for at least a given period of time. When the system is
described by a connected network of N components (nodes) and their L connection
(links), the reliability of the system becomes a difficult network design
problem which solutions are of great practical interest in science and
engineering. This paper discusses the numerical method of finding the most
reliable network for a given N and L using genetic algorithm. For a given
topology of the network, the reliability is numerically computed using
adjacency matrix. For a search in the space of all possible topologies of the
connected network with N nodes and L links, genetic operators such as mutation
and crossover are applied to the adjacency matrix through a string
representation. In the context of graphs, the mutation of strings in genetic
algorithm corresponds to the rewiring of graphs, while crossover corresponds to
the interchange of the sub-graphs. For small networks where the most reliable
network can be found by exhaustive search, genetic algorithm is very efficient.
For larger networks, our results not only demonstrate the efficiency of our
algorithm, but also suggest that the most reliable network will have high
symmetry.

They construct simultaneous prediction intervals using multiple comparison

a functor Sq_{B/A} from the derived category D(B) of complexes B-modules into
itself. The squaring operation is needed for the definition of rigid complexes
(in the sense of Van den Bergh), that in turn leads to a new approach to
Grothendieck duality for rings, schemes and even DM stacks.
  In our paper with J.J. Zhang from 2008 we introduced the squaring operation,
and explored some of its properties. Unfortunately some of the proofs in that
paper had severe gaps in them.
  In the present paper we reproduce the construction of the squaring operation.
This is done in a somewhat more general context than in the first paper: here
we consider a homomorphism A -> B of commutative DG rings. Our first main
result is that the square Sq_{B/A}(M) of a DG B-module M is independent of the
resolutions used to present it. Our second main result is on the trace
functoriality of the squaring operation. We give precise statements and
complete correct proofs.
  In a subsequent paper we will reproduce the remaining parts of the 2008 paper
that require fixing. This will allow us to proceed with the other papers,
mentioned in the bibliography, on the rigid approach to Grothendieck duality.
  The proofs of the main results require a substantial amount of foundational
work on commutative and noncommutative DG rings, including a study of semi-free
DG rings, their lifting properties, and their homotopies. This part of the
paper could be of independent interest.

is difficult or impossible to measure in situ. We construct a two-dimensional,
single phase model for the steady-state mean grain size beneath a mid-ocean
ridge. The mantle rheology is modelled as a composite of diffusion creep,
dislocation creep, dislocation accommodated grain boundary sliding, and a
plastic stress limiter. The mean grain size is calculated by the piezometric
relationship of Austin and Evans [2007]. We investigate the sensitivity of our
model to global variations in grain growth exponent, potential temperature,
spreading-rate, and mantle hydration. We interpret the mean mean grain-size
field in the context of permeability. The permeability structure due to mean
grain size may be approximated as a high permeability region beneath a low
permeability region. The transition between high and low permeability regions
forms a boundary that is steeply sloped toward the ridge axis. We hypothesise
that such a permeability structure generated from the variability of the mean
grain size may be able to focus melt towards the ridge axis, analogous to a
Sparks and Parmentier [1991]-type focusing. This focusing may, in turn,
constrain the region where significant melt fractions are observed by seismic
or magnetotelluric surveys. This interpretation of melt focusing via the
grain-size permeability structure is consistent with MT observation of the
asthenosphere beneath the East Pacific Rise [Baba et al., 2006, Key et al.,
2013].

universal and flexible tool, allowing for highly successful approaches on tasks
like denoising, deblurring, inpainting, segmentation, super-resolution,
disparity, and optical flow estimation. The overall structure of such
approaches is of the form ${\cal D}(Ku) + \alpha {\cal R} (u) \rightarrow
\min_u$ ; where the functional ${\cal D}$ is a data fidelity term also
depending on some input data $f$ and measuring the deviation of $Ku$ from such
and ${\cal R}$ is a regularization functional. Moreover $K$ is a (often linear)
forward operator modeling the dependence of data on an underlying image, and
$\alpha$ is a positive regularization parameter. While ${\cal D}$ is often
smooth and (strictly) convex, the current practice almost exclusively uses
nonsmooth regularization functionals. The majority of successful techniques is
using nonsmooth and convex functionals like the total variation and
generalizations thereof or $\ell_1$-norms of coefficients arising from scalar
products with some frame system. The efficient solution of such variational
problems in imaging demands for appropriate algorithms. Taking into account the
specific structure as a sum of two very different terms to be minimized,
splitting algorithms are a quite canonical choice. Consequently this field has
revived the interest in techniques like operator splittings or augmented
Lagrangians. Here we shall provide an overview of methods currently developed

kV/cm. Both electron and hole g-factors are determined by high resolution laser
spectroscopy with resonance fluorescence detection. This, along with the low
electrical-noise environment, gives very high quality experimental results. The
hole g-factor g_xh depends linearly on the electric field Fz, dg_xh/dFz = (8.3

electric field, dg_xe/dFz = (0.1 +/- 0.3)* 10^-4 cm/kV (results averaged over a

4x4 k.p model demonstrating that the electric field sensitivity arises from a
combination of soft hole confining potential, an In concentration gradient and
a strong dependence of material parameters on In concentration. The electric
field sensitivity of the hole spin can be exploited for electrically-driven

solutions for all dimensional cases. The results are commonly characterized by
a simple ""physical"" feature that any mass element unit on the object surface
generates the same gravity strength at the considered point, in the direction
along the rotational symmetry axis.

unimodality or minimum distance between similarity scores). Seriation is thus
inherently a problem of finding the optimal solution among a set of
permutations of objects. In this short technical note, we review the
combinatorial structure of the classical seriation problem, which seeks a
single solution out of a set of objects. We then extend those results to the
iterative frequency seriation approach introduced by Lipo (1997), which finds
optimal subsets of objects which each satisfy the unimodality criterion within
each subset. The number of possible solutions across multiple solution subsets
is larger than $n!$, which underscores the need to find new algorithms and
heuristics to assist in the deterministic frequency seriation problem.

several users communicating through a relay in a wireless network into
understanding certain subvarieties of products of Grassmannians. We calculate
the dimension of these subvarieties and provide various results concerning
their defning equations. When the relay and all of the users have the same
number of antennas, this approach places fundamental limits on the amount of
data that can be passed through such a network.
