threshold in the quadrangular case using the so-called peeling techniques.
Then, we generalize a result of Angel about the scaling limit of crossing

the sense that they do not depend on the percolation model neither on the

Previous studies have focussed on the probability of such a high relative
velocity amongst selected candidate systems. This notion of `probability' is
however difficult to interpret and can lead to paradoxical results. Instead, we
consider the expected number of Bullet-like systems on the sky up to a
specified redshift, which allows for direct comparison with observations. Using
a Hubble volume N-body simulation with high resolution we investigate how the
number of such systems depends on the masses of the halo pairs, their
separation, and collisional angle. This enables us to extract an approximate
formula for the expected number of halo-halo collisions given specific
collisional parameters. We use extreme value statistics to analyse the tail of
the pairwise velocity distribution and demonstrate that it is fatter than the
previously assumed Gaussian form. We estimate that the number of dark matter
halo pairs as or more extreme than 1E0657-56 in mass, separation and relative
velocity is $1.3^{+2.0}_{-0.6}$ up to redshift $z=0.3$. However requiring the
halos to have collided and passed through each other as is observed decreases
this number to only 0.1. The discovery of more such systems would thus indeed
present a challenge to the standard cosmology.

times on the order of microseconds that persist up to room temperature. Doping
the GaN nanodisk insertions with Ge can reduce these PL decay times by two
orders of magnitude. These phenomena are explained by the three-dimensional
electric field distribution within the GaN nanodisks, which has an axial
component in the range of a few MV/cm associated to the spontaneous and
piezoelectric polarization, and a radial piezoelectric contribution associated
to the shear components of the lattice strain. At low dopant concentrations, a
large electron-hole separation in both the axial and radial directions is
present. The relatively weak radial electric fields, which are about one order
of magnitude smaller than the axial fields, are rapidly screened by doping.
This bidirectional screening leads to a radial and axial centralization of the
hole underneath the electron, and consequently, to large decreases in PL decay
times, in addition to luminescence blue shifts.

explicitly up to $o(1)$. The use of distributional Schwinger-Dyson is a novelty
that allows us treating sufficiently differentiable interactions and the mixing
of scales $1/N^{\alpha}$ and $1/N$, thus waiving the analyticity assumptions

by artistically enhancing their photos through stylistic color and tone
adjustments. However, it is also a time-consuming and challenging task that
requires advanced skills beyond the abilities of casual photographers. Using an
automated algorithm is an appealing alternative to manual work but such an
algorithm faces many hurdles. Many photographic styles rely on subtle
adjustments that depend on the image content and even its semantics. Further,
these adjustments are often spatially varying. Because of these
characteristics, existing automatic algorithms are still limited and cover only
a subset of these challenges. Recently, deep machine learning has shown unique
abilities to address hard problems that resisted machine algorithms for long.
This motivated us to explore the use of deep learning in the context of photo
editing. In this paper, we explain how to formulate the automatic photo
adjustment problem in a way suitable for this approach. We also introduce an
image descriptor that accounts for the local semantics of an image. Our
experiments demonstrate that our deep learning formulation applied using these
descriptors successfully capture sophisticated photographic styles. In
particular and unlike previous techniques, it can model local adjustments that
depend on the image semantics. We show on several examples that this yields
results that are qualitatively and quantitatively better than previous work.

demonstrate that a proper biasing model is essential for reproducing the power
spectrum at quasilinear and even smaller scales. With respect to various
clustering statistics a methodology based on perturbation theory and a
realistic biasing model leads to very good agreement with N-body simulations.
However, for the quadrupole of the correlation function or the power spectrum,
only the method based on semi-N-body simulation could reach high accuracy (1%
level) at small scales, i.e., r<25 Mpc/h or k>0.15 h/Mpc. Full N-body solutions
will remain indispensable to produce reference catalogues. Nevertheless, we
have demonstrated that the far more efficient approximate solvers can reach a

far beyond what is possible using flexible materials alone. One way to access
this potential is to apply a strong optical trap to a minimally supported
mechanical element, thereby increasing its quality factor $Q_m$. Current
schemes, however, require prohibitively high laser power ($\sim10$ W), and the
$Q_m$ enhancement is ultimately limited to a factor of $\sim$ 50 by
hybridization between the trapped mode and the dissipative modes of the
supporting structure. Here we propose a levitation scheme taking full advantage
of an optical resonator to reduce the circulating power requirements by many
orders of magnitude. Applying this scheme to the case of a dielectric disk in a
Fabry-Perot cavity, we find a tilt-based tuning mechanism for optimizing both
center-of-mass and torsional mode traps. Notably, the two modes are trapped
with comparable efficiency, and we estimate that a 10-micron-diameter,
100-nm-thick Si disc could be trapped to a frequency of $\sim$ 10 MHz with only
$30$ mW circulating in a cavity of (modest) finesse 1500. Finally, we simulate
the effect such a strong trap would have on a realistic doubly-tethered disc.
Of central importance, we find torsional motion is comparatively immune to
$Q_m$-limiting hybridization, allowing a $Q_m$ enhancement factor of $\sim$
1500. This opens the possibility of realizing a laser-tuned 10 MHz mechanical
system with a quality factor of order a billion.

PCF was found to be endlessly single-mode for higher air-filling fraction
(d/P). Smaller lengths of triangular-lattice PCF are required for dispersion
compensation whereas PCFs with square-lattice with nearer relative dispersion
slope (RDS) can better compensate the broadband dispersion. Square-lattice PCFs
show ZDW red-shifted, making it preferable for mid-IR supercontinuum generation
(SCG) with highly non-linear chalcogenide material. Square-lattice PCFs show
higher dispersion slope that leads to compression of the broadband, thus
accumulating more power in the pulse. On the other hand, triangular-lattice PCF
with flat dispersion profile can generate broader SCG. Square-lattice PCF with
low Group Velocity Dispersion (GVD) at the anomalous dispersion corresponds to
higher dispersion length and higher degree of solitonic interaction. The
effective area of square-lattice PCF is always greater than its
triangular-lattice counterpart making it better suited for high power
applications. Smaller length of symmetric-core PCF for dispersion compensation,
while broadband dispersion compensation can be better performed with

binary systems to the more general case of noncoplanar disks. As in the
prograde coplanar case, Lindblad resonances play a key role in tidal
truncation. We analyze the tidal torque acting on a misaligned nearly circular
disk in a circular orbit binary system. We concentrate on the 2:1 inner
Lindblad resonance associated with the m=2 tidal forcing (for azimuthal
wavenumber m) that plays a major role in the usual coplanar case. We determine
the inclination dependence of this torque, which is approximately cos^8(i/2)
for misalignment angle i. Compared to the prograde coplanar case (i=0), this
torque decreases by a factor of about 2 for i = pi/6 and by a factor of about
20 for i=pi/2. The Lindblad torque decreases to zero for a tilt angle of pi
(counter-rotation), consistent with previous investigations. The effects of
higher order resonances associated with m>2 tidal forcing may contribute
somewhat, but are much more limited than in the i=0 case. These results suggest
that misaligned disks in binary systems can be significantly extended compared
to their coplanar counterparts. In cases where a disk is sufficiently inclined
and viscous, it can overrun all Lindblad resonances and overflow the Roche lobe
of the disk central object.

stationary spacetimes with complete (timelike) Killing field, with particular
attention to quotients by group actions. This is presented in terms of
algebraic structures which are fairly simple for the static case and more
involved for the stationary case; the most important tool, the fundamental
cocycle, is a cohomological class for static spacetimes but of somewhat looser
structure in the stationary case.
  In particular: (1) A new measurement, similar to the spacetime interval in
Minkowski space, is devised for detecting whether two points are causally
related in a stationary spacetime; this proves very useful for analysis. (2)
All stationary spacetimes are categorized by how they behave with respect to
the fundamental cocycle; this enables a complete characterization of global
causality properties. (3) It is shown how these tools determine whether global
hyperbolicity of a stationary spacetime is inherited by its quotients. (4)
Examples are examined in detail, a large range including both ones of
mathematical curiosity and ones of physical interest, such as cosmic strings in
flat, accelerated, Schwarzschild, Kerr, and other backgrounds.

using a slight structural modification of the simple recurrent neural network

the higher signal-to-noise ratio (by a factor of $\approx 2$) of the VLA

different shape from that of the other three CH$_3$OH lines (at $> 4\sigma$

robust result is obtained by combining the three lines at similar frequencies,

b, WASP-116 b, and WASP-149 b. WASP-85 b orbits its host star every 2.66 days,
and has a mass of 1.25 M_Jup and a radius of 1.25 R_Jup. The host star is of G5
spectral type, with magnitude V = 11.2, and lies 141 pc distant. The system has
a K-dwarf binary companion, WASP-85 B, at a separation of ~1.5"". The close
proximity of this companion leads to contamination of our photometry,
decreasing the apparent transit depth that we account for during our analysis.
Analysis of the Ca II H+K lines shows strong emission that implies that both
binary components are strongly active. WASP-116 b is a warm, mildly inflated
super-Saturn, with a mass of 0.59 M_Jup and a radius of 1.43 R_Jup. It was
discovered orbiting a metal-poor ([Fe/H] = -0.28 dex), cool (T_eff = 5950 K) G0
dwarf every 6.61 days. WASP-149 b is a typical hot Jupiter, orbiting a G6 dwarf
with a period of 1.33 days. The planet has a mass and radius of 1.05 M_Jup and
1.29 R_Jup, respectively. The stellar host has an effective temperature of
T_eff = 5750 K and has a metallicity of [Fe/H] = 0.16 dex. WASP photometry of
the system is contaminated by a nearby star; we therefore corrected the depth
of the WASP transits using the measured dilution. WASP-149 lies inside the
'Neptune desert' identified in the planetary mass-period plane by Mazeh,

  We model the modulation visible in the K2 lightcurve of WASP-85 using a
simple three-spot model consisting of two large spots on WASP-85 A, and one
large spot on WASP-85 B, finding rotation periods of 13.1+/-0.1 days for
WASP-85 A and 7.5+/-0.03 days for WASP-85 B. We estimate stellar inclinations
of I_A = 66.8+/-0.7 degrees and I_B = 39.7+/-0.2 degrees, and constrain the
obliquity of WASP-85 A b to be psi<27 degrees. We therefore conclude that
WASP-85 A b is very likely to be aligned.

antenna that is purpose-designed for precision measurements of the radio
background at long wavelengths. The design, calibration and observing
strategies admit solutions for the internal additive contributions to the
radiometer response, and hence a separation of these contaminants from the
antenna temperature. We present here a wideband measurement of the radio sky
spectrum by SARAS that provides an accurate measurement of the absolute
brightness and spectral index between 110 and 175 MHz. Accuracy in the
measurement of absolute sky brightness is limited by systematic errors of
magnitude 1.2%; errors in calibration and in the joint estimation of sky and
system model parameters are relatively smaller. We use this wide-angle
measurement of the sky brightness using the precision wide-band dipole antenna
to provide an improved absolute calibration for the 150-MHz all-sky map of
Landecker & Wielebinski (1970):subtracting an offset of 21.4 K and scaling by
factor 1.05 will reduce the overall offset error to 8 K (from 50 K) and scale
error to 0.8% (from 5%). The SARAS measurement of the temperature spectral
index is in the range -2.3 to -2.45 in the 110 to 175 MHz band and indicates
that the region towards the Galactic bulge has a relatively flatter index.

two-hop architecture, under which, passengers communicate with base stations
(BSs) via a mobile relay (MR) installed in the train cabin. With this
architecture, all passengers in the train can be represented by the MR. Since
the channels of the MR and local users vary differently, we consider allocating
system resources (power and subcarriers) over two time-scales for them. We
formulate the problem as a capacity optimization problem for the MR subject to
the sum capacity constraint of local users. We treat the inter-carrier
interference (ICI) at the MR as additive Gaussian noise and derive an explicit
expression for the ICI using the two-path Doppler spread model. Then we discuss
the optimization problem and propose an optimal power and subcarrier allocation
(OPSA) policy. The capacity obtained using OPSA is compared with that of
constant power and subcarrier allocation (CPSA) policies. Simulation results
justify the optimality of the OPSA. Besides, by comparing the capacity bounds
achieved by OPSA with and without ICI, we find that only in specific regions,
where the gap between the capacity bounds is large, do practical ICI
cancellation methods provide meaningful rate gain.

The full dynamical state of dark matter can be described as a three-dimensional

study we use a Lagrangian sub-manifold x = x(q,t) (where x and q are co-moving
Eulerian and Lagrangian coordinates respectively), which is dynamically
equivalent to the dark matter sheet but is more convenient for numerical
analysis. Our major results can be summarized as follows. At the resolution of
the simulation i.e. without additional smoothing, the cosmic web represents a
hierarchical structure: each halo is embedded in the filamentary framework of
the web predominantly at the filament crossings, and each filament is embedded
in the wall like fabric of the web at the wall crossings. Locally, each halo or
sub-halo is a peak in the number of streams field. The number of streams in the
neighbouring filaments is higher than in the neighbouring walls. The walls are
regions where number of streams is equal to three or a few. Voids are uniquely
defined by the local condition requiring to be a single-stream flow region. The
shells of streams around haloes are quite thin and the closest void region is
typically within one and a half FOF radius from the center of the halo.

thermodynamic properties which have recently seen very precise $PVT$
measurements by a group at MIT. This group determined local thermodynamic
properties of a system of ultra cold $^6\mbox{Li}$ atoms tuned to Feshbach
resonance. In this paper, I analyze the MIT data with a thermodynamic theory of
unitary thermodynamics based on ideas from critical phenomena. This theory was
introduced in the first paper of this sequence, and characterizes the scaled
thermodynamics by the entropy per particle $z= S/N k_B$, and energy per
particle $Y(z)$, in units of the Fermi energy. $Y(z)$ is in two segments,
separated by a second-order phase transition at $z=z_c$: a ""normal"" segment for
$z>z_c$, and a ""superfluid"" segment for $z<z_c$. For small $z$, the theory
obeys a series $Y(z)=y_0+y_1 z^{\alpha }+y_2 z^{2 \alpha}+\cdots,$ where
$\alpha$ is a constant exponent, and $y_i$ ($i\ge 0$) are constant series
coefficients. For large $z$, the theory obeys a perturbation of the ideal gas
$Y(z)= \tilde{y}_0\,\mbox{exp}[2\gamma z/3]+
\tilde{y}_1\,\mbox{exp}[(2\gamma/3-1)z]+
\tilde{y}_2\,\mbox{exp}[(2\gamma/3-2)z]+\cdots$ where $\gamma$ is a constant
exponent, and $\tilde{y}_i$ ($i\ge 0$) are constant series coefficients. This
limiting form for large $z$ differs from the series used in the first paper,
and was necessary to fit the MIT data. I fit the MIT data by adjusting four
free independent theory parameters: $(\alpha,\gamma,\tilde{y}_0,\tilde{y}_1)$.
This fit process was augmented by trap integration and comparison with earlier
thermal data taken at Duke University. The overall match to both the data sets
was good, and had $\alpha=1.21(3)$, $\gamma=1.21(3)$, $z_c=0.69(2)$, scaled
critical temperature $T_c/T_F=0.161(3)$, where $T_F$ is the Fermi temperature,

This paper focuses on an effective plagiarism detection tool on identifying
suitable intra-corpal plagiarism detection for text based assignments by
comparing unigram, bigram, trigram of vector space model with cosine similarity
measure. Manually evaluated, labelled dataset was tested using unigram, bigram
and trigram vector. Even though trigram vector consumes comparatively more
time, it shows better results with the labelled data. In addition, the selected
trigram vector space model with cosine similarity measure is compared with
tri-gram sequence matching technique with Jaccard measure. In the results,
cosine similarity score shows slightly higher values than the other. Because,
it focuses on giving more weight for terms that do not frequently exist in the
dataset and cosine similarity measure using trigram technique is more
preferable than the other. Therefore, we present our new tool and it could be
used as an effective tool to evaluate text based electronic assignments and
minimize the plagiarism among students.

technologies for future wireless networks. In this paper, we combine them
together in a single system and then present a time switching-based network
coding relaying (TSNCR) protocol for the two-way relay system, where an energy
constrained relay harvests energy from the transmitted radio frequency (RF)
signals from two sources, and then helps the two-way relay information exchange
between the two sources with the consumption of the harvested energy. To
evaluate the system performance, we derive an explicit expression of the outage
probability for the proposed TSNCR protocol. In order to explore the system
performance limit, we formulate an optimization problem to minimize the system
outage probability. Since the problem is non-convex and cannot be directly
solved, we design a genetic algorithm (GA)-based optimization algorithm for it.
Numerical results validate our theoretical analysis and show that in such an EH
two-way relay system, if NC is applied, the system outage probability can be
greatly decreased. Moreover, it is shown that the relay position greatly
affects the system performance of TSNCR, where relatively worse outage
performance is achieved when the relay is placed in the middle of the two
sources. This is the first time to observe such a phenomena in EH two-way relay
systems.

of the density matrix of a multilevel quantum system weakly interacting with
incoherent light. The method combines the Bloch-Redfield theory with a partial
secular approximation for one-photon coherences, resulting in a master equation
that explicitly exposes the reliance on transition rates and the angles between
transition dipole moments in the energy basis. The modified Bloch-Redfield
master equation allows an unambiguous distinction between the regimes of
quantum coherent vs. incoherent energy transfer under incoherent light
illumination. The fully incoherent regime is characterized by orthogonal
transition dipole moments in the energy basis, leading to a dynamical evolution
governed by a coherence-free Pauli-type master equation. The coherent regime
requires non-orthogonal transition dipole moments in the energy basis, and
leads to the generation of noise-induced quantum coherences and
population-to-coherence couplings. As a first application, we consider the
dynamics of excited state coherences arising under incoherent light excitation
from a single ground state, and observe population-to-coherence transfer and
the formation of non-equilibrium quasisteady states in the regime of small
excited state splitting. Analytical expressions derived earlier for the V-type

layer, the phase is realized through the competition between two types of

that the topological phase transition from conventional quantum anomalous Hall
phase to the VQAH phase is due to the change of topological charges with the
generation of additional skyrmions in the real spin texture, when the band gap
closes and reopens at one of the valleys. In the presence of short range
disorders, pairs of the gapless edge channels (one from each valley in a pair)
would be destroyed due to intervalley scattering. However, we discover that in
an extended range of moderate scattering strength, the transport through the
system is quantized and fully valley-polarized, i.e. the system is equivalent
to a quantum anomalous Hall system with valley-filtered chiral edge channels.
We further show that with additional layer degree of freedom, much richer phase
diagram could be realized with multiple VQAH phases. For a bilayer system, we
demonstrate that topological phase transitions could be controlled by the
interlayer bias potential.

The remnant of the eruption shows a unique optical spectrum: strong emission
lines of atoms and molecules superimposed on an M-type stellar spectrum. The
stellar-like remnant is presumably embedded in a disc-like dusty envelope seen
almost face-on. The observed optical spectrum is assumed to result from
interactions of the central-star radiation with dust and gas in the disc and
outflows initiated in 1994. We reduced and measured a high-resolution (R = ~40
000) spectrum of V4332 Sgr obtained with VLT/UVES in April/May 2005. The
spectrum comes from the ESO archives and is the best quality spectrum of the
object ever obtained. We identified and measured over 200 emission features
belonging to 11 elements and 6 molecules. The continuous, stellar-like
component can be classified as ~M3. The interstellar reddening was estimated to
be 0.35 < E(B-V) < 0.75. From radial velocities of interstellar absorption
features in the NaI D lines, we estimated a lower limit of ~5.5 kpc to the
distance of V4332 Sgr. The spectrum of V4332 Sgr considerably evolved between
2005 and 2009. The object significantly faded in the optical, which resulted
from cooling of the main remnant by 300-350 K, corresponding to its
spectral-type change from M3 to M5-6. The object increased in luminosity by
~50%, however, implying a significant expansion of its dimensions. Most of the
emission features seen in 2005 significantly faded or even disappeared from the
spectrum of V4332 Sgr in 2009. These resulted from fading of the optical
central-star radiation and a decrease of the optical thickness of the
cirumstellar matter. V4332 Sgr bears several resemblances to V1309 Sco, which
erupted in 2008. This can indicate a similar nature of the eruptions of the two
objects. The outburst resulted from merger of a contact binary in V1309 Sco.

baryon fraction (fc) and the baryon fraction (fb). At a pivot mass of
$6\times10^{14}M_{\odot}$ and redshift $z=0.9$, the characteristic values are
fstar=$1.1\pm0.1$%, fICM=$9.6\pm0.5$%, fc=$10.4\pm1.2$% and fb=$10.7\pm0.6$%.
These fractions all vary with cluster mass at high significance, indicating
that higher mass clusters have lower fstar and fc and higher fICM and fb. When
accounting for a 15% systematic virial mass uncertainty, there is no
statistically significant redshift trend at fixed mass in these baryon
fractions.

(CBT), has been applied to decompose the combined dynamics of nonholonomic
Wheeled Mobile Robots (WMRs) into three subsystems: intra and inter group shape
dynamics, and the dynamics of the centroid. The intra group shape dynamics can
further be partitioned into the shape dynamics of each group, giving the notion
of multiple group. Thus separate controllers have been designed for each
subsystem. The gains of the controllers are such chosen that the overall system
becomes singularly perturbed system, and different subsystems converge to their
desired values at different times. Then multi-time scale convergence analysis
has been carried out in this paper. Negative gradient of a potential based
function has been added to the controller to ensure collision avoidance among
the robots. Simulation results have been provided to demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed controller.

have been shown to form miniclusters with masses $\sim 10^{-12}M_{\odot}$ and
to become dominant component of dark matter. Some of the axion miniclusters
condense to form axion stars. We have recently shown a possible origin of fast
radio bursts ( FRBs ) by assuming that the axion stars are main component of
halos: FRBs arise from the collisions between the axion stars and neutron
stars. It is remarkable that the masses of the axion stars obtained by the
comparison of the theoretical and observational event rates are coincident with
the mass $\sim 10^{-12}M_{\odot}$. In this paper, we describe our model of FRBs
in detail. We derive the approximate solutions of the axion stars with large
radii and constraint their masses for the approximation to be valid. The FRBs
are emitted by electrons in atmospheres of neutron stars. By calculating the
optical depth of the atmospheres, we show that they are transparent for the
radiations with the frequency given by the axion mass $m_a$ such as
$m_a/2\pi\simeq 2.4$GHz$(m_a/10^{-5}\rm eV)$. Although the radiations are
linearly polarized when they are emitted, they are shown to be circularly
polarized after they pass magnetospheres of neutron stars. We also show that
the FRBs are not broadband and their frequencies have finite bandwidths owing
to the thermal fluctuations of the electrons in the atmospheres of the neutron
stars. The presence of the finite bandwidths is a distinctive feature of our
model and can be tested observationally. Furthermore, we show that similar FRBs
may arise when the axion stars collide with magnetic white dwarfs $B\sim
10^9$G. The distinctive feature is that the durations of the bursts are of the
order of $0.1$second.

  text overlap with arXiv:1412.7811",,,,"cs.CE cs.PF","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The problem of inferring proteins from complex peptide samples in shotgun
proteomic workflow sets extreme demands on computational resources. This is
exacerbated by the fact that, in general, a given protein cannot be defined by
a fixed sequence of amino acids due to the existence of splice variants and
isoforms of that protein. Therefore, the problem of protein inference could be
considered as one of identifying sequences of amino acids with some limited
tolerance. Two problems arise from this: a) due to these variations, the
applicability of exact string matching methodologies could be questioned and b)
the difficulty of defining a reference sequence for a particular set of
proteins that are functionally indistinguishable, but with some variation in
features. This paper presents a model-based inference approach that is
developed and validated to solve the inference problem. Our approach starts
from an examination of the known set of splice variants and isoforms of a
target protein to identify the Greatest Common Stable Substring (GCSS) of amino
acids and the Substrings Subjects to Limited Variation (SSLV) and their
respective locations on the GCSS. Then we define and solve the Sub-string
Matching Problem with Limited Tolerance (SMPLT). This approach is validated on
identified peptides in a labelled and clustered data set from UNIPROT.
Identification of Baylisascaris Procyonis infection was used as an application
instance that achieved up to 70 times speedup compared to a software only
system. This workflow can be generalised to any inexact multiple pattern
matching application by replacing the patterns in a clustered and distributed
environment which permits a distance between member strings to account for
permitted deviations such as substitutions, insertions and deletions.

study the intrinsic stability of high-speed turbulent flames. Calculations
model the interaction of a fully-resolved premixed flame with a highly
subsonic, statistically steady, homogeneous, isotropic turbulence. We consider
a wide range of turbulent intensities and system sizes, corresponding to the
Damk\""ohler numbers Da = 0.1-6.0. These calculations show that turbulent flames
in the regimes considered are intrinsically unstable. In particular, we find
three effects. 1) Turbulent flame speed develops pulsations with the observed
peak-to-peak amplitude > 10 and a characteristic time scale close to a
large-scale eddy turnover time. Such variability is caused by the interplay
between turbulence, which continuously creates the flame surface, and highly
intermittent flame collisions, which consume the flame surface. 2) Unstable
burning results in the periodic pressure build-up and the formation of pressure
waves or shocks, when the flame speed approaches or exceeds the speed of a
Chapman-Jouguet deflagration. 3) Coupling of pressure gradients formed during
pulsations with density gradients across the flame leads to the anisotropic
amplification of turbulence inside the flame volume and flame acceleration.
Such process, which is driven by the baroclinic term in the vorticity transport
equation, is a reacting-flow analog of the mechanism underlying the
Richtmyer-Meshkov instability. With the increase in turbulent intensity, the
limit-cycle instability discussed here transitions to the regime described in
our previous work, in which the growth of the flame speed becomes unbounded and
produces a detonation.

these dynamic impacts, and may not provide the information needed to assess
technologies and emissions mitigation opportunities in the context of broader
climate policy goals. Here we formulate a portfolio optimization model that
incorporates changes in technology impacts as a radiative forcing (RF)

energy consumption while meeting the RF target, is obtained by year-wise
minimization of the marginal RF impact in an intended stabilization year. The
optimal portfolio calls for using certain higher methane-emitting technologies
prior to an optimal switching year, followed by methane-light technologies as
the stabilization year approaches. The model is applied to transportation
technology pairs and shows that, by accounting for the differing decay behavior
of gases, optimal switching portfolios allow energy consumption gains of up to
50% compared to relying on the higher methane-emitting technology alone. The
results allow for estimates of target timelines for mitigating methane
