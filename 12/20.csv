experimental technique for studying the properties of individual biological
molecules in solution. However, as adoption of smFRET techniques becomes more
widespread, the lack of available software, whether open source or commercial,
for data analysis, is becoming a significant issue. Here, we present pyFRET, an
open source Python package for the analysis of data from single-molecule
fluorescence experiments from freely diffusing biomolecules. The package
provides methods for the complete analysis of a smFRET dataset, from burst
selection and denoising, through data visualisation and model fitting. We
provide support for both continuous excitation and alternating laser excitation
(ALEX) data analysis. pyFRET is available as a package downloadable from the
Python Package Index (PyPI) under the open source three-clause BSD licence,
together with links to extensive documentation and tutorials, including example
usage and test data. Additional documentation including tutorials is hosted
independently on ReadTheDocs. The code is available from the free hosting site
Bitbucket. Through distribution of this software, we hope to lower the barrier
for the adoption of smFRET experiments by other research groups and we
encourage others to contribute modules for specific analysis needs.

associated with outflow. Weak free-free continuum emission in the centimeter
domain is associated with these jets.
  Observations in the cm range are most useful to trace the base of the ionized
jets, close to the YSO and its accretion disk, where jets are accelerated and
collimated. Optical or near-IR images are obscured by the high extinction
present. Radio recombination lines in jets (in combination with proper motions)
should provide their 3D kinematics. SKA will be crucial to perform this kind of
observations.
  Thermal radio jets are associated with both low and high mass protostars. The
ionizing mechanism appears to be related to shocks in the associated outflows,
as suggested by the observed correlation between the centimeter luminosity and
the outflow momentum rate. From this correlation and that with the bolometric
luminosity of the driving star it will be possible to discriminate with SKA
between unresolved HII regions and jets, and to infer physical properties of
the embedded objects.
  Some jets show indications of non-thermal emission (negative spectral
indices) in their lobes. Linearly polarized synchrotron emission has been found
in the lobes of the jet of HH 80-81, allowing us to measure the direction and
intensity of the magnetic field, a clue ingredient in determining the jet
collimation and ejection mechanisms. As only a fraction of the emission is
polarized, very sensitive observations such as those that will be feasible with
SKA are required to perform these studies in other objects.
  Jets are common in many kinds of astrophysical scenarios. Characterizing YSO
radio jets, whose physical conditions can be reliably determined from their
thermal emission, would be also useful in understanding acceleration and
collimation mechanisms in all kinds of astrophysical jets.

stationary in the Voyager-defined System III longitude system as previously
thought. The extended region of south polar stratospheric emission has cooled
dramatically poleward of the sharp temperature gradient near 75$^\circ$S,
coinciding with a depletion in the abundances of acetylene and ethane, and
suggestive of stratospheric upwelling with vertical wind speeds of
$w\approx+0.1$ mm/s. This is mirrored by a general warming of the northern
polar stratosphere and an enhancement in acetylene and ethane abundances that
appears to be most intense poleward of 75$^\circ$N, suggesting subsidence at
$w\approx-0.15$ mm/s. However, the sharp gradient in stratospheric emission
expected to form near 75$^\circ$N by northern summer solstice (2017,

development of a northern summer stratospheric vortex. North polar minima in
tropospheric and stratospheric temperatures were detected in 2008-2010 (lagging

studied numerically by taking into account the effect of different accretion

long-period low magnetic field pulsars should also be expected as a possible
outcome of the binary evolution, depending on the strength of the accretion
rate during the Roche-lobe overflow. In particular, we argue that IGR
J17480-2446 belongs to this new class of objects.

for strong field phenomena in laser-plasma interactions. After describing the

solutions for several associated methodological and algorithmic problems. We
propose a modified event generator that precisely models the entire spectrum of
incoherent particle emission without any low-energy cutoff, and which imposes
close to the weakest possible demands on the numerical time step. Based on
this, we also develop an adaptive event generator that subdivides the time step
for locally resolving QED events, allowing for efficient simulation of
cascades. Further, we present a new and unified technical interface for
including the processes of interest in different PIC implementations. Two PIC
codes which support this interface, PICADOR and ELMIS, are also briefly
reviewed.

cosmic microwave background (CMB). In the standard model of cosmology, these
are interpreted as the three neutrino species. However, at the time of
CMB-decoupling, neutrinos are not only relativistic but they are also
freestreaming. Here, we investigate, whether the CMB is sensitive to this
defining feature of neutrinos, or whether the CMB-data allow to replace
neutrinos with a relativistic fluid. We show that free streaming particles are
preferred over a relativistic perfect fluid with $\Delta\chi^2\simeq 21$. We
also study the possibility to replace the neutrinos by a viscous fluid and find
that a relativistic viscous fluid with either the standard values $c_{\rm
eff}^2=c_{\rm vis}^2=1/3$ or best fit values for $c_{\rm eff}^2$ and $c_{\rm

parton scattering. Using $20.3\, \mathrm{fb^{-1}}$ of data collected with the
ATLAS experiment at the LHC in $pp$ collisions at $\sqrt{s}=8\, \mathrm{TeV}$,
the first measurement of associated $Z + J/\psi$ production is presented for
both prompt and non-prompt $J/\psi$ production, with both signatures having a
significance in excess of $5\sigma$. The inclusive production cross-sections
for $Z$ boson production (analysed in $\mu^+\mu^-$ or $e^+e^-$ decay modes) in
association with prompt and non-prompt $J/\psi(\to\mu^+\mu^-)$ are measured
relative to the inclusive production rate of $Z$ bosons in the same fiducial
volume to be $(36.8\pm 6.7\pm 2.5) \times 10^{-7}$ and $(65.8\pm 9.2\pm 4.2)

ratios are also determined as a function of the $J/\psi$ transverse momentum.
The fraction of signal events arising from single and double parton scattering
is estimated, and a lower limit of $5.3\ (3.7)\, \mathrm{mb}$ at $68\ (95)$%

K$_{0.83}$Fe$_{1.53}$Se$_2$. This material is an insulator, unlike many parent
compounds of iron-based superconductors. We found a sharp excitation around 1
eV, which is resonantly enhanced when the incident photon energy is tuned near
the pre-edge region of the absorption spectrum. The spectral weight and line
shape of this excitation exhibit clear momentum dependence. In addition, we
observe momentum-independent broad interband transitions at higher excitation
energy of 3-7 eV. Calculations based on a 70 band $dp$ orbital model, using a
moderate $U_{\rm eff}\approx 2.5$ eV, indicate that the $\sim$1 eV feature
originates from the correlated Fe 3$d$ electrons, with a dominant $d_{xz}$ and
$d_{yz}$ orbital character. We find that a moderate $U_{\rm eff}$ yields a
satisfying agreement with the experimental spectra, suggesting that the
electron correlations in the insulating and metallic iron based superconductors
are comparable.

persistent homology by calculating the first few Betti numbers. These Betti
numbers count connected components, topological circles, and trapped volumes

accessible energy scales attracted considerable interest in the particle
physics literature. Surprisingly, however, the construction of
heterotic--string derived models that allow for an extra Z' to remain unbroken
down to low scales has proven to be very difficult. The main reason being that
the U(1) symmetries that are typically discussed in the literature are either
anomalous or have to be broken at a high scale to generate light neutrino
masses. In this paper we use for that purpose the self duality property under
the spinor vector duality, which was discovered in free fermionic
heterotic-string models. The chiral massless states in the self--dual models
fill complete 27 representations of E6. The anomaly free gauge symmetry in the
effective low energy field theory of our string model is $SU(4)_C\times
SU(2)_L\times SU(2)_R\times U(1)_\zeta$, where $U(1)_\zeta$ is the family
universal $U(1)$ symmetry that descends from E6, and is typically anomalous in
other free fermionic heterotic-string models. Our model therefore allows for
the existence of a low scale Z', which is a combination of $B-L$, $T_{3_L}$ and
$T_{3_R}$. The string model is free of exotic fractionally charged states in
the massless spectrum. It contains exotic SO(10) singlet states that carry
fractional, non--E6 charge, with respect to $U(1)_\zeta$. These non-E6 states
arise in the string model due to the breaking of the E6 symmetry by discrete
Wilson lines. They represent a distinct signature of the string vacua and
cannot arise in E6 Grand Unified Theories. They may provide viable dark matter
candidates.

massive gravitino degrees of freedom in a curved space-time background, in the

that may proceed via a sequence of adaptive queries to the game's payoff
function, assumed to be unknown initially. The general topic we consider is
\emph{query complexity}, that is, how many queries are necessary or sufficient
to compute an exact or approximate Nash equilibrium.
  We show that exact equilibria cannot be found via query-efficient algorithms.
We also give an example of a 2-strategy, 3-player anonymous game that does not
have any exact Nash equilibrium in rational numbers. However, more positive
query-complexity bounds are attainable if either further symmetries of the
utility functions are assumed or we focus on approximate equilibria. We
investigate four sub-classes of anonymous games previously considered by
\cite{bfh09, dp14}.
  Our main result is a new randomized query-efficient algorithm that finds a
$O(n^{-1/4})$-approximate Nash equilibrium querying $\tilde{O}(n^{3/2})$
payoffs and runs in time $\tilde{O}(n^{3/2})$. This improves on the running
time of pre-existing algorithms for approximate equilibria of anonymous games,
and is the first one to obtain an inverse polynomial approximation in
poly-time. We also show how this can be utilized as an efficient
polynomial-time approximation scheme (PTAS). Furthermore, we prove that
$\Omega(n \log{n})$ payoffs must be queried in order to find any
$\epsilon$-well-supported Nash equilibrium, even by randomized algorithms.

there are n servers, and O(n) distinct types of content. Each server can store
and serve O(1) types at any given time. Demands for these content types arrive,
and have to be served in an online fashion; over time, there are a total of
O(n) of these demands. We consider the algorithmic task of content placement:
determining which types of content should be on which server at any given time,
in the setting where the demand statistics (i.e. the relative popularity of
each type of content) are not known a-priori, but have to be inferred from the
very demands we are trying to satisfy. This is the high- dimensional regime
because this scaling (everything being O(n)) prevents consistent estimation of
demand statistics; it models many modern settings where large numbers of users,
servers and videos/webpages interact in this way. We characterize the
performance of any scheme that separates learning and placement (i.e. which use
a portion of the demands to gain some estimate of the demand statistics, and
then uses the same for the remaining demands), showing it is order-wise
strictly suboptimal. We then study a simple adaptive scheme - which myopically
attempts to store the most recently requested content on idle servers - and
show it outperforms schemes that separate learning and placement. Our results
also generalize to the setting where the demand statistics change with time.
Overall, our results demonstrate that separating the estimation of demand, and
the subsequent use of the same, is strictly suboptimal.

Planck-weak- and flavor-hierarchies of the Standard Model (SM), it has been
argued that certain observables can be calculated within the 5D effective field
theory only with the Higgs field propagating in the bulk of the extra
dimension, just like other SM fields. The related studies also suggested an
interesting form of decoupling of the heavy Kaluza-Klein (KK) fermion states in
the warped 5D SM in the limit where the profile of the SM Higgs approaches the
IR brane. We demonstrate that a similar phenomenon occurs when we include the
mandatory KK excitations of the SM Higgs in loop diagrams giving dipole
operators for SM fermions, where the earlier work only considered the SM Higgs
(zero mode). In particular, in the limit of a quasi IR-localized SM Higgs, the
effect from summing over KK Higgs modes is unsuppressed (yet finite), in
contrast to the naive expectation that KK Higgs modes decouple as their masses
become large. In this case, a wide range of KK Higgs modes have
quasi-degenerate masses and enhanced couplings to fermions relative to those of
the SM Higgs, which contribute to the above remarkable result. In addition, we
find that the total contribution from KK Higgs modes in general can be
comparable to that from the SM Higgs alone. It is also interesting that KK
Higgs couplings to KK fermions of the same chirality as the corresponding SM
modes have an unsuppressed overall contribution, in contrast to the result from
the earlier studies involving the SM Higgs. Our studies suggest that KK Higgs
bosons are generally an indispensable part of the warped 5D SM, and their
phenomenology such as signals at the LHC are worth further investigation.

spherical object. We map the $J = 1\rightarrow 0$ transitions of $^{12}$CO,
$^{13}$CO, C$^{18}$O, and C$^{17}$O, and detect emission from all
isotopologues. We do not detect the $0_0\rightarrow 1_{-1} E$ masing lines of
CH$_3$OH at 108.8939 GHz. The strongest CO emission is from the
photodissociation region (PDR), and there is a deficit of emission toward the
bubble interior. We find no evidence for expansion of the molecular material
associated with RCW120 and therefore can make no claims about its geometry. The
lack of detected expansion is roughly in agreement with models for the
time-evolution of an HII region like RCW120, and is consistent with an
expansion speed of $< 1.5\, {\rm km\, s^{-1}}$. Single-position CO spectra show
signatures of expansion, which underscores the importance of mapped spectra for
such work. Dust temperature enhancements outside the PDR of RCW120 coincide
with a deficit of emission in CO, confirming that these temperature
enhancements are due to holes in the RCW120 PDR. H$\alpha$ emission shows that
RCW120 is leaking $\sim5\%$ of the ionizing photons into the interstellar
medium (ISM) through PDR holes at the locations of the temperature
enhancements. H-alpha emission also shows a diffuse ""halo"" from leaked photons
not associated with discrete holes in the PDR. Overall $25\pm10\%$ of all

similarities to the well-mixed Moran model with effective parameters which

Predictions from the reduced theory match the results from stochastic

graph algorithms and graph-oriented queries. To achieve the best possible query
performance, they need to be implemented at the core of a database management
system that aims at storing, manipulating, and querying graph data.
Increasingly, modern business applications demand native graph query and
processing capabilities for enterprise-critical operations on data stored in
relational database management systems. In this paper we propose an extensible
graph traversal framework (GRAPHITE) as a central graph processing component on
a common storage engine inside a relational database management system.
  We study the influence of the graph topology on the execution time of graph
traversals and derive two traversal algorithm implementations specialized for
different graph topologies and traversal queries. We conduct extensive
experiments on GRAPHITE for a large variety of real-world graph data sets and
input configurations. Our experiments show that the proposed traversal
algorithms differ by up to two orders of magnitude for different input
configurations and therefore demonstrate the need for a versatile framework to
efficiently process graph traversals on a wide range of different graph
topologies and types of queries. Finally, we highlight that the query
performance of our traversal implementations is competitive with those of two
native graph database management systems.

sensitive to gravitational waves from the inspiral, merger, and ringdown (IMR)

both RER and pathwise FIM depend only on averages of the force field therefore

to be determined by the lifetime of the carriers of current, rather than the

that the lifetime only depends on temperature, implying the vanishing of an

suggest that this concept extends to the magnetic field dependence of the

BaFe$_2$(As$_{1-x}$P$_{x}$)$_2$ near its quantum critical point. We find that
the lifetime depends on magnetic field in the same way as it depends on

These measurements imply that high magnetic fields probe the same quantum
dynamics that give rise to the $T$-linear resistivity, revealing a novel kind
of magnetoresistance that does not depend on details of the Fermi surface, but
rather on the balance of thermal and magnetic energy scales. This opens new
opportunities for the investigation of transport near a quantum critical point

experimentally address the information to energy conversion in a quantum

dissipated during the implementation of a global system-reservoir unitary
interaction that changes the information content of the system. By employing an
interferometric technique we were able to reconstruct the heat distribution
associated with the unitary interaction. Then, through quantum state
tomography, we measured the relative change in the entropy of the system. In
this way we were able to verify that an operation that changes the information
content of the system must necessary generate heat in the reservoir, exactly as
predicted by Landauer's principle. The scheme presented here allows for the
detailed study of irreversible entropy production in quantum information

2012. This nova evolved very rapidly in all observed wavelengths. The time to
fall two magnitudes in the V band was only 2 days. In X-rays the super soft
phase began 13$\pm$5 days after discovery and ended around day 50 after
discovery. During the super soft phase, the \Swift/XRT and \Chandra\ spectra
were consistent with the underlying white dwarf being very hot, $\sim$ 1 MK,
and luminous, $\sim$ 10$^{38}$ erg s$^{-1}$. The UV, optical, and near-IR
photometry showed a periodic variation after the initial and rapid fading had
ended. Timing analysis revealed a consistent 19.24$\pm$0.03 hr period in all
UV, optical, and near-IR bands with amplitudes of $\sim$ 0.3 magnitudes which
we associate with the orbital period of the central binary. No periods were
detected in the corresponding X-ray data sets. A moderately high inclination
system, $i$ = 60$\pm$10$^{\arcdeg}$, was inferred from the early optical
emission lines. The {\it HST}/STIS UV spectra were highly unusual with only the
\ion{N}{5} (1240\AA) line present and superposed on a blue continuum. The lack
of emission lines and the observed UV and optical continua from four epochs can
be fit with a low mass ejection event, $\sim$ 10$^{-6}$ M$_{\odot}$, from a hot
and massive white dwarf near the Chandrasekhar limit. The white dwarf, in turn,
significantly illuminated its subgiant companion which provided the bulk of the
observed UV/optical continuum emission at the later dates. The inferred extreme
white dwarf characteristics and low mass ejection event favor nova LMC 2012
being a recurrent nova of the U Sco subclass.

secondary bow shocks that may intersect and lead to enhanced emission. When the
bow shocks intersect at or above a certain critical angle, a planar shock
called a Mach stem is formed. These shocks could produce brighter H$\alpha$
emission since the incoming flow to the Mach stem is parallel to the shock
normal. In this paper we report first results of a study using 2-D numerical
simulations designed to explore Mach stem formation at the intersection of bow
shocks formed by hypersonic ""bullets"" or ""clumps"". Our 2-D simulations show how
the bow shock shapes and intersection angles change as the adiabatic index
$\gamma$ changes. We show that the formation or lack of a Mach stem in our
simulations is consistent with the steady-state Mach stem formation theory. Our
ultimate goal, which is part of an ongoing research effort, is to characterize
the physical and observational consequences of bow shock intersections
including the formation of Mach stems.

having locally star-forming environments are dimmer than SNe~Ia having locally
passive environments.Here we use the \constitution\ sample together with host
galaxy data from \GALEX\ to independently confirm that result. The effect is
seen using both the SALT2 and MLCS2k2 lightcurve fitting and standardization
methods, with brightness differences of $0.094 \pm 0.037\ \mathrm{mag}$ for
SALT2 and $0.155 \pm 0.041\ \mathrm{mag}$ for MLCS2k2 with $R_V=2.5$. When
combined with our previous measurement the effect is $0.094 \pm 0.025\
\mathrm{mag}$ for SALT2. If the ratio of these local SN~Ia environments changes
with redshift or sample selection, this can lead to a bias in cosmological
measurements. We explore this issue further, using as an example the direct
measurement of $H_0$. \GALEX{} observations show that the SNe~Ia having
standardized absolute magnitudes calibrated via the Cepheid period--luminosity
relation using {\textit{HST}} originate in predominately star-forming
environments, whereas only ~50% of the Hubble-flow comparison sample have
locally star-forming environments. As a consequence, the $H_0$ measurement
using SNe~Ia is currently overestimated. Correcting for this bias, we find a
value of $H_0^{corr}=70.6\pm 2.6\ \mathrm{km\ s^{-1}\ Mpc^{-1}}$ when using the
LMC distance, Milky Way parallaxes and the NGC~4258 megamaser as the Cepheid
zeropoint, and $68.8\pm 3.3\ \mathrm{km\ s^{-1}\ Mpc^{-1}}$ when only using

1\,\sigma$ of recent indirect measurements based on the CMB power spectrum.

generalizes our prior work on ideal mixtures of ideal gases and binary liquid
mixtures. In this formulation we combine and extend a number of existing
descriptions of multispecies transport available in the literature. The
formulation applies to non-ideal mixtures of arbitrary number of species,
without the need to single out a 'solvent' species, and includes contributions
to the diffusive mass flux due to gradients of composition, temperature and
pressure. Momentum transport and advective mass transport are handled using a
low Mach number approach that eliminates fast sound waves (pressure
fluctuations) from the full compressible system of equations and leads to a
quasi-incompressible formulation. Thermal fluctuations are included in our
fluctuating hydrodynamics description following the principles of
nonequilibrium thermodynamics. We extend the semi-implicit staggered-grid
finite-volume numerical method developed in our prior work on binary liquid
mixtures, and use it to study the development of giant nonequilibrium
concentration fluctuations in a ternary mixture subjected to a steady
concentration gradient. We also numerically study the development of
diffusion-driven gravitational instabilities in a ternary mixture, and compare
our numerical results to recent experimental measurements in a Hele-Shaw cell.
We find that giant nonequilibrium fluctuations can trigger the instability but
are eventually dominated by the deterministic growth of the unstable mode, in
both quasi two-dimensional (Hele-Shaw), and fully three-dimensional geometries
used in typical shadowgraph experiments.

octahedral tilt correlations in the underdoped regime of La2-xBaxCuO4 is
addressed by utilizing complementary neutron powder diffraction and inelastic
neutron scattering (INS) approaches. Long-range and static CuO6 tilt order with
orthogonally inequivalent Cu-O bonds in the CuO2 planes in the low temperature
tetragonal (LTT) phase is succeeded on warming through the low-temperature
transition by one with orthogonally equivalent bonds in the low temperature
orthorhombic (LTO) phase. In contrast, the signatures of LTT-type tilts in the
instantaneous local atomic structure persist on heating throughout the LTO
crystallographic phase on the nanoscale, although becoming weaker as
temperature increases. Analysis of the INS spectra for the x = 1/8 composition
reveals the dynamic nature of the LTT-like tilt fluctuations within the LTO
phase and their 3D character. The doping dependence of relevant structural
parameters indicates that the magnitude of the Cu-O bond anisotropy has a
maximum at x = 1/8 doping where bulk superconductivity is most strongly
suppressed, suggesting that the structural anisotropy might be influenced by
electron-phonon coupling and the particular stability of the stripe-ordered
phase at this composition. The bond-length modulation that pins stripe order is
found to be remarkably subtle, with no anomalous bond length disorder at low
temperature, placing an upper limit on any in-plane Cu-O bondlength anisotropy.
The results further reveal that although appreciable octahedral tilts persist
through the high-temperature transition and into the high temperature
tetragonal (HTT) phase, there is no significant preference between different
tilt directions in the HTT regime.

  contribution (previously it was under a review as a conference submission),
  and fixes some typos",,,,"stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Two recently introduced criteria for estimation of generative models are both
based on a reduction to binary classification. Noise-contrastive estimation
(NCE) is an estimation procedure in which a generative model is trained to be
able to distinguish data samples from noise samples. Generative adversarial
networks (GANs) are pairs of generator and discriminator networks, with the
generator network learning to generate samples by attempting to fool the
discriminator network into believing its samples are real data. Both estimation
procedures use the same function to drive learning, which naturally raises
questions about how they are related to each other, as well as whether this
function is related to maximum likelihood estimation (MLE). NCE corresponds to
training an internal data model belonging to the {\em discriminator} network
but using a fixed generator network. We show that a variant of NCE, with a
dynamic generator network, is equivalent to maximum likelihood estimation.
Since pairing a learned discriminator with an appropriate dynamically selected
generator recovers MLE, one might expect the reverse to hold for pairing a
learned generator with a certain discriminator. However, we show that
recovering MLE for a learned generator requires departing from the
distinguishability game. Specifically:
  (i) The expected gradient of the NCE discriminator can be made to match the
expected gradient of
  MLE, if one is allowed to use a non-stationary noise distribution for NCE,
  (ii) No choice of discriminator network can make the expected gradient for
the GAN generator match that of MLE, and
  (iii) The existing theory does not guarantee that GANs will converge in the
non-convex case.
  This suggests that the key next step in GAN research is to determine whether
GANs converge, and if not, to modify their training algorithm to force
convergence.

compare their nucleosynthesis. We follow the evolution from the main sequence
until the end of core helium burning. The GENEC and KEPLER models hold physics
assumptions used in large grids of published models. The MESA code was set up
to use convective core overshooting such that the CO core masses are consistent
with those obtained by GENEC. For all models, full nucleosynthesis is computed
using the NuGrid post-processing tool MPPNP.
  We find that the surface abundances predicted by the models are in reasonable
agreement. In the helium core, the standard deviation of the elemental
overproduction factors for Fe to Mo is less than $30\,\%$---smaller than the
impact of the present nuclear physics uncertainties. For our three initial
masses, the three stellar evolution codes yield consistent results. Differences
in key properties of the models, e.g., helium and CO core masses and the time
spent as a red supergiant, are traced back to the treatment of convection and,
to a lesser extent, mass loss. The mixing processes in stars remain the key

method in a way that na\""{i}vely combines information across filters. The
second, penalized generalized Lomb-Scargle (PGLS), builds on the first by more
intelligently borrowing strength across filters. Specifically, we incorporate
constraints on the phases and amplitudes across the different functions using a

optimize the penalized likelihood by combining block coordinate descent with
the majorization-minimization (MM) principle. We illustrate our methods on

systems with many degrees of freedom. They have proven successful in describing
very different settings, from nuclei spectra to conduction in mesoscopic
systems, from holographic models to various aspects of mathematical physics.
This success reflects the existence of a large universality class for all these
systems, signaled by the Wigner-Dyson statistics for the matrix eigenvalues.
These models are defined in a base invariant way and this rotational symmetry
has traditionally been read to imply that they describe extended system. In
this work we show that certain matrix models, which show deviations from the
Wigner-Dyson distribution, can spontaneously break their rotational ($U(N)$)
invariance and localize their eigenvectors on a portion of the Hilbert space.
This conclusion establishes once more a direct connection between the
eigenvalue and eigenvector distributions. Recognizing this loss of ergodicity
discloses the power of non-perturbative techniques available for matrix models
to the study of localization problems and introduces a novel spontaneous
symmetry breaking mechanism. Moreover, it brings forth the overlooked role of
eigenvectors in the study of matrix models and allows for the consideration of
new types of observable.

existence of additional light states beyond those captured by such fractional

stars in the super-Eddington regime including both their radiative feedback and
protostellar outflows. The calculations start from a prestellar core of dusty
gas and continue until the star stops growing. The accretion ends when the
remnants of the core are ejected, mostly by the force of the direct stellar
radiation in the polar direction and elsewhere by the reradiated thermal
infrared radiation. How long the accretion persists depends on whether the
protostellar outflows are present. We set the mass outflow rate to 1% of the
stellar sink particle's accretion rate. The outflows open a bipolar cavity
extending to the core's outer edge, through which the thermal radiation readily
escapes. The radiative flux is funneled into the polar directions while the
core's collapse proceeds near the equator. The outflow thus extends the
""flashlight effect"", or anisotropic radiation field, found in previous studies
from the few hundred AU scale of the circumstellar disk up to the 0.1 parsec
scale of the core. The core's flashlight effect allows core gas to accrete on
the disk for longer, in the same way that the disk's flashlight effect allows
disk gas to accrete on the star for longer. Thus although the protostellar
outflows remove material near the core's poles, causing slower stellar growth
over the first few free-fall times, they also enable accretion to go on longer
in our calculations. The outflows ultimately lead to stars of somewhat higher
mass.

cent (13/28) of all bursts in our sample and 55$\pm$10 per cent (13/26) of long
GRBs are optically dark, which is statistically consistently with previous
studies. Fitting RATIR optical and NIR spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of
19 GRBs, most (6/7) optically dark GRBs either occur at high-redshift ($z>4.5$)
or have a high dust content in their host galaxies ($A_{\rm V} > 0.3$).
Performing K-S tests, we compare the RATIR sample to those previously presented
in the literature, finding our distributions of redshift, optical darkness,
host dust extinction and X-ray derived column density to be consistent. The one
reported discrepancy is with host galaxy dust content in the BAT6 sample, which
appears inconsistent with our sample and other previous literature. Comparing
X-ray derived host galaxy hydrogen column densities to host galaxy dust
extinction, we find that GRBs tend to occur in host galaxies with a higher
metal-to-dust ratio than our own Galaxy, more akin to the Large and Small
Magellanic Clouds. Finally, to mitigate time evolution of optical darkness, we
measure $\beta_{\rm OX,rest}$ at a fixed rest frame time, $t_{\rm rest}=1.5$
hours and fixed rest frame energies in the X-ray and optical regimes. Choosing
to evaluate optical flux at $\lambda_{\rm rest}=0.25~\mu$m, we remove
high-redshift as a source of optical darkness, demonstrating that optical
darkness must result from either high-redshift, dust content in the host galaxy
along the GRB sight line, or a combination of the two.

contributing up to 15 % in some bands, and is directly constrained by one
spectroscopical epoch.
  The approach describes variations of the observed flux as the continuum,
modeled as a stochastic Gaussian process, and emission line contribution,
modeled as a scaled, smoothed and delayed version of the continuum. This
approach is capable not only to interpolate in time between measurements, but
also to determine confidence limits on continuum -- line emission delays. This
approach is applied to SDSS observations in 'Stripe 82' (S82) providing flux
measurements precise to 2 % at $\sim$ 60 epochs over $\sim$ 10 years. The
strong annual variations in the epoch sampling prove a serious limitation in
practice. Also, suitable redshift ranges must be identified, where strong broad
emission line contribute to one filter, but not to another.
  Through generating and evaluating problem-specific mock data, we verify that
S82-like data can constrain $\tau_{\mathrm{delay}}$ for a simple transfer
function model. In application to real data, we estimate
$\tau_{\mathrm{delay}}$ for 323 AGN with $0.225 < z < 0.846$, combining
information for different objects through the ensemble-scaling relationships

solve the corresponding equation with an implicit conjugate gradient scheme. We
discuss several issues of unphysical heat transport in the cases of extreme
ansiotropies or unmagnetized regions and present possible numerical
workarounds. We implement our algorithm into the GADGET code and study its
behaviour in several test cases. In general, we reproduce the analytical
solutions of our idealised test problems, and obtain good results in
cosmological simulations of galaxy cluster formations. Within galaxy clusters,
the anisotropic conduction produces a net heat transport similar to an
isotropic Spitzer conduction model with an efficiency of one per cent. In
contrast to isotropic conduction our new formalism allows small-scale structure
in the temperature distribution to remain stable, because of their decoupling
caused by magnetic field lines. Compared to observations, isotropic conduction
with more than 10 per cent of the Spitzer value leads to an oversmoothed
temperature distribution within clusters, while the results obtained with
anisotropic thermal conduction reproduce the observed temperature fluctuations
well. A proper treatment of heat transport is crucial especially in the
outskirts of clusters and also in high density regions. It's connection to the
local dynamical state of the cluster also might contribute to the observed
bimodal distribution of cool core and non cool core clusters. Our new scheme
significantly advances the modelling of thermal conduction in numerical

place. Eventually, some of the stars are ejected from the clusters, becoming
runaway stars. These stars move supersonically through the cloud and develop
bowshocks where particles can be accelerated up to relativistic energies. As a
result, the bowshocks present non-thermal emission, and inject relativistic
protons in the cloud. These protons diffuse in the GMC interacting with the
matter. We present a model for the non-thermal radiation generated by protons
and secondary pairs accelerated in the bowshocks of massive runaways stars

its implication to higher-spin holography was much debated. We find an
affirmative result on this question by utilizing conformal bootstrap approach.
In solving for the crossing symmetry condition, we propose a new approach based
on specification for the low-lying spectrum distribution. We find the
traditional one-gap bootstrapping is not suited since the nontrivial fixed
point expected from large-N expansion sits at deep interior (not at boundary or
kink) of allowed solution region. We propose two-gap bootstrapping that
specifies scaling dimension of two lowest scalar operators. The approach carves
out vast region of lower scaling dimensions and universally features two tips.
We find that the sought-for nontrivial fixed point now sits at one of the tips,
while the Gaussian fixed point sits at the other tip. The scaling dimensions of
scalar operators fit well with expectation based on large-N expansion. We also
find indication that the fixed point persist for lower values of N all the way
down to N=1. This suggests that interacting unitary conformal field theory
exists in five dimensions for all nonzero N.

obtaining small and fast-to-execute models, and it has shown that a student
network could imitate the soft output of a larger teacher network or ensemble
of networks. In this paper, we extend this idea to allow the training of a
student that is deeper and thinner than the teacher, using not only the outputs
but also the intermediate representations learned by the teacher as hints to
improve the training process and final performance of the student. Because the
student intermediate hidden layer will generally be smaller than the teacher's
intermediate hidden layer, additional parameters are introduced to map the
student hidden layer to the prediction of the teacher hidden layer. This allows
one to train deeper students that can generalize better or run faster, a
trade-off that is controlled by the chosen student capacity. For example, on
CIFAR-10, a deep student network with almost 10.4 times less parameters
outperforms a larger, state-of-the-art teacher network.

quasiballistic heat conduction in semiconductor alloys but also applies to

stemming from minor mergers. A new method for constraining gravitational
potential in elliptical galaxies has recently been suggested. It uses the
spectral line profiles of these shells to measure the circular velocity at the
edge of the shell and the expansion velocity of the shell itself. MOND is an
alternative to the dark matter framework aiming to solve the missing mass
problem.
  Aims. We study how the circular and expansion velocities behave in MOND for
large shells.
  Methods. The asymptotic behavior for infinitely large shells is derived
analytically. The applicability of the asymptotic results for finitely sized
shells is studied numerically on a grid of galaxies modeled with S\'ersic
spheres.
  Results. Circular velocity settles asymptotically at a value determined by
the baryonic mass of the galaxy forming the baryonic Tully-Fisher relation
known for disk galaxies. Shell expansion velocity also becomes asymptotically
constant. The expansion velocities of large shells form a multibranched analogy
to the baryonic Tully-Fisher relation, together with the galactic baryonic
masses. For many - but not all - shell galaxies, the asymptotic values of these
two types of velocities are reached under the effective radius. If MOND is
assumed to work in ellipticals, then the shell spectra allow many details of
the history to be revealed about the formation of the shell system, including
its age. The results pertaining to circular velocities apply to all elliptical
galaxies, not only those with shells.

One of many difficulties is that the norm of the back-propagated error gradient
can grow or decay exponentially. Here we show that training very deep
feed-forward networks (FFNs) is not as difficult as previously thought. Unlike
when back-propagation is applied to a recurrent network, application to an FFN
amounts to multiplying the error gradient by a different random matrix at each
layer. We show that the successive application of correctly scaled random
matrices to an initial vector results in a random walk of the log of the norm
of the resulting vectors, and we compute the scaling that makes this walk
unbiased. The variance of the random walk grows only linearly with network
depth and is inversely proportional to the size of each layer. Practically,
this implies a gradient whose log-norm scales with the square root of the
network depth and shows that the vanishing gradient problem can be mitigated by
increasing the width of the layers. Mathematical analyses and experimental
results using stochastic gradient descent to optimize tasks related to the
MNIST and TIMIT datasets are provided to support these claims. Equations for

probe quantum criticality of the underlying model. In the off-critical region
the distribution becomes Gaussian. Close to criticality the distribution
becomes a universal function uniquely characterized by a single critical
exponent, that we compute explicitly. This contrasts standard equilibrium
quantum fluctuations for which the critical distribution depends on a numerable

possibility of using temporal fluctuations to determine pseudo-critical

  incidence and age of onset","29 pages, 12 figures",,,,"q-bio.TO q-bio.QM","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is an autoimmune disease of the beta cells of the
pancreas. The nonobese diabetic (NOD) mouse is a commonly used animal model,
with roughly an 80% incidence rate of T1D among females. In 100% of NOD mice,
macrophages and T-cells invade the islets in a process called insulitis. It can
be several weeks between insulitis and T1D, and some mice do not progress at
all. It is thought that this delay is mediated by regulatory T-cells (Tregs)
and that a gradual loss of effectiveness in this population leads to T1D.
However, this does not explain why some mice progress and others do not. We
propose a simple mathematical model of the interaction between beta cells and
the immune populations, including regulatory T-cells. We find that individual
mice may enter one of two stable steady states: a `mild' insulitis state that
does not progress to T1D and a `severe' insulitis state that does. We then run
a sensitivity analysis to identify which parameters affect incidence of T1D
versus those that affect age of onset. We also test the model by simulating
several experimental manipulations found in the literature that modify
insulitis severity and/or Treg activity. Notably, we are able to match a
reproduce a large number of phenomena using a relatively small number of
equations. We finish by proposing experiments that could help validate or
refine the model.

Particularly, this is the first time that the sound velocity is found to first
increase and then decrease as the superlattice strength increases even at one

competition between the decreasing compressibility and the increasing effective
mass due to the increasing superlattice strength. This result suggests a new
route to engineer the sound velocity by manipulating the superlattice's

structure of the metal constituent of the alkaline-earth metal oxide. The
striking observation that CO adsorption strength is weaker than NO adsorption
on the (100) terraces as the period of the alkaline-earth metal in the oxide
increases, is analyzed in detail in terms of charge redistribution within the
{\sigma} and {\pi} channels of adsorbates. Finally, we also present oxygen
adsorption and oxygen vacancy formation energies in these oxide systems.

two parameters: $\alpha > 0$, corresponding to the elastic response, and $\nu >
0$, corresponding to viscosity. Formally setting these parameters to $0$
reduces the equations to the incompressible Euler equations of ideal fluid
flow. In this article we study the limits $\alpha, \nu \to 0$ of solutions of
the second-grade fluid system, in a smooth, bounded, two-dimensional domain
with no-slip boundary conditions. This class of problems interpolates between
the Euler-$\alpha$ model ($\nu = 0$), for which the authors recently proved
convergence to the solution of the incompressible Euler equations, and the
Navier-Stokes case ($\alpha = 0$), for which the vanishing viscosity limit is
an important open problem. We prove three results. First, we establish
convergence of the solutions of the second-grade model to those of the Euler
equations provided $\nu = \mathcal{O}(\alpha^2)$, as $\alpha \to 0$, extending
the main result in [19]. Second, we prove equivalence between convergence (of
the second-grade fluid equations to the Euler equations) and vanishing of the
energy dissipation in a suitably thin region near the boundary, in the
asymptotic regime $\nu = \mathcal{O}(\alpha^{6/5})$, $\nu/\alpha^2 \to \infty$
as $\alpha \to 0$. This amounts to a convergence criterion similar to the
well-known Kato criterion for the vanishing viscosity limit of the
Navier-Stokes equations to the Euler equations. Finally, we obtain an extension
of Kato's classical criterion to the second-grade fluid model, valid if $\alpha
= \mathcal{O}(\nu^{3/2})$, as $\nu \to 0$. The proof of all these results
relies on energy estimates and boundary correctors, following the original idea
by Kato.

man-made devices and equipments. When a device or equipment involves composite
or multiple elastic materials, elasticity interface problems come into play.
The solution of three dimensional (3D) elasticity interface problems is
significantly more difficult than that of elliptic counterparts due to the
coupled vector components and cross derivatives in the governing elasticity
equation. This work introduces the matched interface and boundary (MIB) method
for solving 3D elasticity interface problems. The proposed MIB method utilizes
fictitious values on irregular grid points near the material interface to
replace function values in the discretization so that the elasticity equation
can be discretized using the standard finite difference schemes as if there
were no material interface. The interface jump conditions are rigorously
enforced on the intersecting points between the interface and the mesh lines.
Such an enforcement determines the fictitious values. A number of new technique
are developed to construct efficient MIB schemes for dealing with cross
derivative in coupled governing equations. The proposed method is extensively
validated over both weak and strong discontinuity of the solution, both
piecewise constant and position-dependent material parameters, both smooth and
nonsmooth interface geometries, and both small and large contrasts in the
Poisson's ratio and shear modulus across the interface. Numerical experiments
indicate that the present MIB method is of second order convergence in both
$L_\infty$ and $L_2$ error norms.

passenger point of view urban bus systems can be complex and difficult to
navigate, especially for disadvantaged users, i.e. tourists, novice users,
older people, and people with impaired cognitive or physical abilities. We
present Urban Bus Navigator (UBN), a reality-aware urban navigation system for
bus passengers with the ability to recognize and track the physical public
transport infrastructure such as buses. Unlike traditional location-aware
mobile transport applications, UBN acts as a true navigation assistant for
public transport users. Insights from a six-month long trial in Madrid indicate
that UBN removes barriers for public transport usage and has a positive impact
on how people feel about public transport journeys.

minimize an unknown objective given only unbiased samples of the objective
function. Furthermore, we aim to achieve this using as few samples as possible.
In the absence of computational constraints, the minimizer of a sample average
of observed data -- commonly referred to as either the empirical risk minimizer
(ERM) or the $M$-estimator -- is widely regarded as the estimation strategy of
choice due to its desirable statistical convergence properties. Our goal in
this work is to perform as well as the ERM, on every problem, while minimizing
the use of computational resources such as running time and space usage.
  We provide a simple streaming algorithm which, under standard regularity
assumptions on the underlying problem, enjoys the following properties:
  * The algorithm can be implemented in linear time with a single pass of the
observed data, using space linear in the size of a single sample.
  * The algorithm achieves the same statistical rate of convergence as the
empirical risk minimizer on every problem, even considering constant factors.
  * The algorithm's performance depends on the initial error at a rate that
decreases super-polynomially.
  * The algorithm is easily parallelizable.
  Moreover, we quantify the (finite-sample) rate at which the algorithm becomes
competitive with the ERM.

according to the values of the response variable, is common in biomedical,
epidemiological, economic and social studies. In particular, the complete
obser- vations in data with censoring, truncation or missing covariates can be
regarded as response-biased sampling under certain conditions. This paper
proposes to use transformation models, known as the generalized accelerated
failure time model in econometrics, for regression analysis with
response-biased sampling. With unknown error distribution, the transformation
models are broad enough to cover linear re- gression models, the Cox's model
and the proportional odds model as special cases. To the best of our knowledge,
except for the case-control logistic regression, there is no report in the
literature that a prospective estimation approach can work for biased sampling
without any modification. We prove that the maximum rank corre- lation
estimation is valid for response-biased sampling and establish its consistency
and asymptotic normality. Unlike the inverse probability methods, the proposed
method of estimation does not involve the sampling probabilities, which are
often difficult to obtain in practice. Without the need of estimating the
unknown trans- formation function or the error distribution, the proposed
method is numerically easy to implement with the Nelder-Mead simplex algorithm,
which does not require convexity or continuity. We propose an inference
procedure using random weight- ing to avoid the complication of density
estimation when using the plug-in rule for variance estimation. Numerical
studies with supportive evidence are presented. Applications are illustrated
with the Forbes Global 2000 data and the Stanford heart transplant data.

and kagome lattices exhibit a rigidity percolation transition when the number
of braces is $\sim L\ln L$, where $L$ is the linear size of the lattice. This
transition exhibits features of both first order and second order transitions:
the whole lattice becomes rigid at the transition, whereas there exists a
diverging length scale. In contrast, we find that the rigidity percolation
transition in the generic lattices occur when the number of braces is very
close to the number obtained from the Maxwell's law for floppy modes, which is
$\sim L$. The transition in generic lattices is a very sharp first-order-like
transition, at which the addition of one brace connects all small rigid regions

near the dissipation scale, impinges on several problems of current interest.
Radio sources observed through the turbulent solar wind are broadened due to
refraction by and scattering off density inhomogeneities, and observations of
scatter broadening are often employed to constrain the turbulence amplitude.
The extent of such scatter broadening is usually computed using the structure
function, which gives a measure of the spatial correlation measured by an
interferometer. Most such treatments have employed analytical approximations to
the structure function that are valid in the asymptotic limits $s \gg l_{i}$ or
$s \ll l_{i}$, where $s$ is the interferometer spacing and $l_{i}$ is the inner
scale of the density turbulence spectrum. We instead use a general structure
function (GSF) that straddles these regimes, and quantify the errors introduced
by the use of these approximations. We have included the effects of anisotropic
scattering for distant cosmic sources viewed through the solar wind at small
elongations. We show that the regimes where the GSF predictions are more
accurate than those of the asymptotic expressions are not only of practical
relevance, but are where inner scale effects influence estimates of scatter
broadening. Taken together, we argue that the GSF should henceforth be used for
scatter broadening calculations and estimates of turbulence amplitudes in the
solar corona and solar wind.

step called pre-training: first search for a good generative model for the

implications of this simple principle, by establishing a connection with the
interplay of orbits and stabilizers of group actions. Although the neural
networks themselves may not form groups, we show the existence of {\em shadow}
groups whose elements serve as close approximations.
  Over the shadow groups, the pre-training step, originally introduced as a
mechanism to better initialize a network, becomes equivalent to a search for
features with minimal orbits. Intuitively, these features are in a way the {\em
simplest}. Which explains why a deep learning network learns simple features
first. Next, we show how the same principle, when repeated in the deeper
layers, can capture higher order representations, and why representation
complexity increases as the layers get deeper.

for the LAMOST Spectroscopic Survey of the Galactic anti-center (LSS-GAC). For
a given LSS-GAC plate, the spectra are first processed with a set of nominal
spectral response curves (SRCs) and used to derive initial stellar atmospheric
parameters (effective temperature $T_{\rm eff}$, surface gravity log\,$g$ and
metallicity [Fe/H]) as well as dust reddening $E(B-V)$ of all targeted stars.
For each of the sixteen spectrographs, several F-type stars of good
signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) are then selected as flux standard stars for
further, iterative spectral flux calibration. Comparison of spectrophotometric
colours, deduced from the flux-calibrated spectra, with the photometric
measurements yields average differences of 0.02$\pm$0.07 and
$-$0.04$\pm$0.09\,mag for the $(g-r)$ and $(g-i)$, respectively. The relatively
large negative offset in $(g-i)$ is due to the fact that we have opted not to
correct for the telluric bands, most notably the atmospheric A-band in the
wavelength range of $i$-band. Comparison of LSS-GAC multi-epoch observations of
duplicate targets indicates that the algorithm has achieved an accuracy of
about 10 per cent in relative flux calibration for the wavelength range 4000 --
9000\,\AA. The shapes of SRC deduced for the individual LAMOST spectrographs
are found to vary by up to 30 per cent for a given night, and larger for
different nights, indicating that the derivation of SRCs for the individual
plates is essential in order to achieve accurate flux calibration for the
LAMOST spectra.

local responses of a bank of linear filters are described as jointly Gaussian,
with zero mean and a covariance that varies slowly over spatial position. We
optimize sets of filters so as to minimize the nuclear norms of matrices of
their local activations (i.e., the sum of the singular values), thus
encouraging a flexible form of sparsity that is not tied to any particular
dictionary or coordinate system. Filters optimized according to this objective
are oriented and bandpass, and their responses exhibit substantial local
correlation. We show that images can be reconstructed nearly perfectly from
estimates of the local filter response covariances alone, and with minimal
degradation (either visual or MSE) from low-rank approximations of these
covariances. As such, this representation holds much promise for use in
applications such as denoising, compression, and texture representation, and
may form a useful substrate for hierarchical decompositions.

  Next, we turn to a distributed setting. In this setting the SV source
consists of a random sequence of pairs $(a_1, b_1), (a_2, b_2), \ldots$

prove a necessary condition and a sufficient condition for the possibility of

the problem of common randomness extraction essentially reduces to the problem

approximation of a massive Dirac equation with general nonlinear self-coupling:
\[ -i\hbar\alpha\cdot\nabla w+a\beta w+V(x)w=g(|w|)w \,. \] Compared with some
existing issues, the most interesting results obtained here are twofold: the
solutions concentrating around local minima of the external potential; and the
nonlinearities assumed to be either super-linear or asymptotically linear at
the infinity. As a consequence one sees that, if there are $k$ bounded domains
$\Lambda_j\subset\mathbb{R}^3$ such that $-a<\min_{\Lambda_j}
V=V(x_j)<\min_{\partial\Lambda_j}V$, $x_j\in\Lambda_j$, then the $k$-families
of solutions $w_\hbar^j$ concentrates around $x_j$ as $\hbar\to 0$,
respectively. The proof relies on variational arguments: the solutions are
found as critical points of an energy functional. The Dirac operator has a
continuous spectrum which is not bounded from below and above, hence the energy
functional is strongly indefinite. A penalization technique is developed here
to obtain the desired solutions.

lens of a real valued function. It has widely been used in applications,
however its use on real data means that it is desirable and increasingly
necessary to have methods for comparison of Reeb graphs. Recently, several
methods to define metrics on the space of Reeb graphs have been presented. In
this paper, we focus on two: the functional distortion distance and the
interleaving distance. The former is based on the Gromov--Hausdorff distance,
while the latter utilizes the equivalence between Reeb graphs and a particular
class of cosheaves. However, both are defined by constructing a
near-isomorphism between the two graphs of study. In this paper, we show that
the two metrics are strongly equivalent on the space of Reeb graphs. In
particular, this gives an immediate proof of bottleneck stability for
persistence diagrams in terms of the Reeb graph interleaving distance.

is proposed in this setting where the communication and coordination of work
among concurrent processes (local workers), is based on an elastic force which
links the parameters they compute with a center variable stored by the
parameter server (master). The algorithm enables the local workers to perform
more exploration, i.e. the algorithm allows the local variables to fluctuate
further from the center variable by reducing the amount of communication
between local workers and the master. We empirically demonstrate that in the
deep learning setting, due to the existence of many local optima, allowing more
exploration can lead to the improved performance. We propose synchronous and
asynchronous variants of the new algorithm. We provide the stability analysis
of the asynchronous variant in the round-robin scheme and compare it with the
more common parallelized method ADMM. We show that the stability of EASGD is
guaranteed when a simple stability condition is satisfied, which is not the
case for ADMM. We additionally propose the momentum-based version of our
algorithm that can be applied in both synchronous and asynchronous settings.
Asynchronous variant of the algorithm is applied to train convolutional neural

equation obtained from Hamilton's equations taking dissipation and stochastic

realizations of the stochastic field by an extension of the Furutsu-Novikov
formula to the case of a non-Gaussian field. As the result, a generalization of
the classical Bogolyubov-Born-Green-Kirkwood-Yvon (BBGKY) hierarchy is derived.
In order to get a kinetic equation for the one-particle distribution function,
we use a regular cut off procedure of the BBGKY hierarchy by assuming weak
interaction between the particles and weak intensity of the field. Within this
approximation we get the corresponding Fokker-Planck equation for the system in
a non-Gaussian stochastic field. Two particular cases by assuming either
Gaussian statistics of external perturbation or homogeneity of the system are
discussed.

The particles are arranged in a finite number of consecutive rows, numbered

  We consider the uniform probability measure on the set of all discrete

description of the uniform probability measure on the set of all tilings of
certain polygons with lozenges. We prove a determinantal structure, and
calculate the correlation kernel.
  We consider the asymptotic behaviour of the system as the size increases
under the assumption that the empirical distribution of the deterministic
particles on the top row converges weakly. We consider the asymptotic `shape'
of such systems. We provide parameterisations of the asymptotic boundaries and
investigate the local geometric properties of the resulting curves. We show
that the boundary can be partitioned into natural sections which are determined

analysis is based on 19.5 fb$^{-1}$ of proton-proton collision data at
$\sqrt{s}=8$ TeV collected by the ATLAS experiment at the Large Hadron
Collider. Charged Higgs bosons are searched for in events consistent with
top-quark pair production or in associated production with a top quark. The
final state is characterised by the presence of a hadronic $\tau$ decay,
missing transverse momentum, $b$-tagged jets, a hadronically decaying $W$
boson, and the absence of any isolated electrons or muons with high transverse
momenta. The data are consistent with the expected background from Standard
Model processes. A statistical analysis leads to 95\% confidence-level upper
limits on the product of branching ratios $ {\cal B}(t\rightarrow bH^\pm)
\times {\cal B} (H^\pm\rightarrow \tau^{\pm}\nu) $, between 0.23% and 1.3% for

of $\tan\beta$ above one for charged Higgs boson masses between 80 GeV and 160
GeV, and exclude a region of parameter space with high $\tan\beta$ for
$H^{\pm}$ masses between 200 GeV and 250 GeV.

four fractal sets. The sets are contaminated with an additive noise with
amplitude $\gamma = 10^{-5} \div 10^{-1}$. The accuracy of calculated numerical
values of the fractal dimensions is analyzed as a function of $\gamma$ for
different sizes of the data sample ($n_{tot}$). In particular, it has been
found that a tiny ($10^{-5}$) addition of noise generates much larger (three
orders of magnitude) error of the calculated fractal exponents. Natural
saturation of the error for larger noise values prohibits the power-like
scaling. Moreover, the noise effect cannot be cured by taking larger data
samples.

is linearized around a steady uniform flow. A closed-form solution of a
boundary-initial value problem is obtained, and it is used to describe several
phenomena. Specifically, the scenarios examined involve a smooth velocity field
in stop-and-go traffic, a discontinuous velocity field with shock waves in a
traffic light problem, and discontinuous displacement fields in a problem where
a single platoon of vehicles splits into two, and later merges back into one.

  The main theorem we prove is a bound for character sums over short intervals
in function fields. Our result is unconditional and slightly better than what
is known (conditionally under GRH) in the integer case and might be of
independent interest.

Alignment Index (GALI) methods of chaos detection. These are efficient chaos
indicators based on the evolution of two or more, initially distinct, deviation
vectors from the studied orbit. After explaining the motivation behind the
introduction of these indices, we sum up the behaviors they exhibit for regular
and chaotic motion, as well as for stable and unstable periodic orbits,
focusing mainly on finite-dimensional conservative systems: autonomous
Hamiltonian models and symplectic maps. We emphasize the advantages of these
methods in studying the global dynamics of a system, as well as their ability
to identify regular motion on low dimensional tori. Finally we discuss several
applications of these indices to problems originating from different scientific
fields like celestial mechanics, galactic dynamics, accelerator physics and
condensed matter physics.

experiments in several biologically relevant fluids and have analyzed patterns
generated by different types of absorbers. We observe that the growth velocity
of branches in the dendritic patterns can decrease below the value expected for
natural drying.

information on the game's payoff structure. In addition, agents receive private
signals on each other's private information. We show that once agents possess
these different types of information, there exists a coordination game in the
evaluation of this information. And even though the precisions of both signal
types is exogenous, the precision with which agents predict each other's
actions at equilibrium turns out to be endogenous. As a consequence, we find
that there exist multiple equilibria if the private signals' precision is high.
These equilibria differ with regard to the way that agents weight their private
information to reason about each other's actions.
