a combined experimental and theoretical study for innershell photoionization of
neutral atomic nitrogen for photon energies of $403-475$~eV. Results are
reported for the total ion yield cross section, for the branching ratios for
formation of N$^+$, N$^{2+}$, and N$^{3+}$, and for the average charge state.
We find significant differences when comparing to the data currently available
to the astrophysics community. For example, while the branching ratio to
N$^{2+}$ is somewhat reduced, that for N$^+$ is greatly increased, and that to
N$^{3+}$, which was predicted not to be zero, grows to $\approx 10\%$ at the
higher photon energies studied. This work demonstrates some of the shortcomings
in the theoretical CSD data base for innershell ionization and points the way
for the improvements needed to more reliably model the role of innershell
ionization of cosmic plasmas.

Cosmic Web, on the other hand, provides the strongest constraints on the

the volume of the Universe, yet they contain ~%95 of galaxies. The cosmic web,
being a cellular system with well-defined boundaries, sets a restricted set of
intermittent positions a galaxy can occupy along a given line-of-sight. Using
the information in the density field computed from spectroscopic redshifts we
can narrow the possible locations of a given galaxy along the line of sight
from a single broad probability distribution (from photo-z) to one or a few
narrow peaks. Our first results improve previous photo-z errors by more than

space, is the defining characteristics of a stationary diffusion process
without detailed balance. In over-damped soft matter systems, such behavior is
a hallmark of the presence of a sustained external driving force accompanied
with dissipations. In an under-damped and strongly correlated system, however,
cyclic motions are often the consequences of a conservative dynamics. In the
present paper, we give a novel interpretation of a class of diffusion processes
with stationary circulation in terms of a Maxwell-Boltzmann equilibrium in
which cyclic motions are on the level set of stationary probability density
function thus non-dissipative, e.g., a supercurrent. This implies an
orthogonality between stationary circulation $J^{ss}(x)$ and the gradient of
stationary probability density $f^{ss}(x)>0$. A sufficient and necessary
condition for the orthogonality is a decomposition of the drift $b(x)=j(x)+
D(x)\nabla\varphi(x)$ where $\nabla\cdot j(x)=0$ and $j(x)$
$\cdot\nabla\varphi(x)=0$. Stationary processes with Maxwell-Boltzmann
equilibrium has an underlying conservative dynamics $\dot{x}= j(x)\equiv$
$\big(f^{ss}(x)\big)^{-1}J^{ss}(x)$, and a first integral $\varphi(x)\equiv-\ln
f^{ss}(x)=$ const, akin to a Hamiltonian system. At all time, an instantaneous
free energy balance equation exists for a given diffusion system; and an
extended energy conservation law among a family of diffusion processes with
different parameter $\alpha$ can be established via a Helmholtz theorem. For
the general diffusion process without the orthogonality, a nonequilibrium cycle
emerges, which consists of external driven $\varphi$-ascending steps and
spontaneous $\varphi$-descending movements, alternated with iso-$\varphi$
motions. The theory presented here provides a rich mathematical narrative for
complex mesoscopic dynamics.

have circular cross-section. The magnetic field depression is associated with a
diamagnetic azimuthal current provided by a population of trapped electrons in
petal-like orbits. The trapped electron population provides a mean azimuthal
velocity and since trapping preferentially selects high pitch angles, a
perpendicular temperature anisotropy. The structures arise out of initial
perturbations in the course of the turbulent evolution of the plasma, and are
stable over at least 100 electron gyroperiods. We have verified the model for
the EVMH by carrying out test particle and PIC simulations of isolated
structures in a uniform plasma. It is found that (quasi-)stable structures can
be formed provided that there is some initial perpendicular temperature
anisotropy at the structure location. The properties of these structures (scale
size, trapped population etc.) are able to explain the observed properties of

randomize the velocity, as in the Drude model, and eventually the ergodic

However, Landau and followers have shown that this is not always the case. If
elementary excitations (e.g. phonons) have higher velocity than that of the
flow, simple kinematic considerations imply metastability of the vortex state:
the energy of the motion cannot dissipate into phonons. On the other hand if
this Landau criterion is violated the circulating current can decay. Below we
show that the standard Landau and Bogoliubov superfluidity criteria fail in
low-dimensional circuits. Proper determination of the superfluidity

long-range order, and that due to attractive interactions, which can lead to
localized Bose clumps (stars or solitons) that only exhibit short range

present in the standard collisional Boltzmann equation, we argue that it is
essential to the field theory dynamics, and we explain why the latter analysis

attractive interactions -- gravitation and scalar-scalar contact interactions

dynamically organized neural assemblies interacting with each other in a
complex way. It has been suggested that looking at the dynamical properties of
complex patterns of brain functional co-activity may reveal neural mechanisms
underlying the dynamic changes in functional interactions. Here, we examine how
global network dynamics is shaped by different network configurations, derived
from realistic brain functional interactions. We focus on two main dynamics
measures: synchrony and variations in synchrony. Neural activity and the
inferred hemodynamic response of the network nodes are simulated using system
of 90 FitzHugh-Nagumo neural models subject to system noise and time-delayed
interactions. These models are embedded into the topology of the complex brain
functional interactions, whose architecture is additionally reduced to its main
structural pathways. In the simulated functional networks, patterns of
correlated regional activity clearly arise from dynamical properties that
maximize synchrony and variations in synchrony. Our results on the fast changes
of the level of the network synchrony also show how flexible changes in the

techniques derived from existing assembly principles, that possibly better
exploit NGS data redundancy. Results: We propose a novel method, implemented in
the software Leon, for compression of DNA sequences issued from high throughput
sequencing technologies. This is a lossless method that does not need a
reference genome. Instead, a reference is built de novo from the set of reads
as a probabilistic de Bruijn Graph, stored in a Bloom filter. Each read is
encoded as a path in this graph, storing only an anchoring kmer and a list of
bifurcations indicating which path to follow in the graph. This new method will
allow to have compressed read files that also already contain its underlying de
Bruijn Graph, thus directly re-usable by many tools relying on this structure.

quasihole excitations in the Mott lobes. Moreover, we show that there are
number fluctuations in the Mott lobes even at zero temperature and therefore
that the true Mott-insulating state never exists if the interactions with the
dye are included.

  branching process",,,,,"stat.OT math.PR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We study the nonparametric estimation of the branching rate $B(x)$ of a
supercritical Bellman-Harris population: a particle with age $x$ has a random
lifetime governed by $B(x)$; at its death time, it gives rise to $k \geq 2$
children with lifetimes governed by the same division rate and so on. We
observe in continuous time the process over $[0,T]$. Asymptotics are taken as
$T \rightarrow \infty$; the data are stochastically dependent and one has to
face simultaneously censoring, bias selection and non-ancillarity of the number
of observations. In this setting, under appropriate ergodicity properties, we
construct a kernel-based estimator of $B(x)$ that achieves the rate of
convergence $\exp(-\lambda_B \frac{\beta}{2\beta+1}T)$, where $\lambda_B$ is
the Malthus parameter and $\beta >0$ is the smoothness of the function $B(x)$
in a vicinity of $x$. We prove that this rate is optimal in a minimax sense and
we relate it explicitly to classical nonparametric models such as density
estimation observed on an appropriate (parameter dependent) scale. We also shed
some light on the fact that estimation with kernel estimators based on data
alive at time $T$ only is not sufficient to obtain optimal rates of
convergence, a phenomenon which is specific to nonparametric estimation and
that has been observed in other related growth-fragmentation models.

Due
to the high computational complexity of existing image encryption technology,
it is extremely challenging to provide privacy preserving image services for
resource-constrained smart device. In this paper, we propose a novel
encrypressive cloud-assisted image service scheme, called eCIS. The key idea of
eCIS is to shift the high computational cost to the cloud allowing reduction in
complexity of encoder and decoder on resource-constrained device. This is done
via compressive sensing (CS) techniques, compared with existing approaches, we
are able to achieve privacy protection at no additional transmission cost. In
particular, we design an encryption matrix by taking care of image compression
and encryption simultaneously. Such that, the goal of our design is to minimize
the mutual information of original image and encrypted image. In addition to
the theoretical analysis that demonstrates the security properties and
complexity of our system, we also conduct extensive experiment to evaluate its
performance. The experiment results show that eCIS can effectively protect
image privacy and meet the user's adaptive secure demand. eCIS reduced the
system overheads by up to $4.1\times\sim6.8\times$ compared with the existing
CS based image processing approach.

those that show pulsations. The lack of detectable pulses represents a big open
problem for two important reasons. The first is that the structure of the
accretion flow in the region closest to the neutron star is not well understood
and it is therefore unclear what is the mechanism that prevents the pulse
formation. The second is that the detection of pulsations would immediately
reveal the spin of the neutron star. Aql X-1 is a special source among low mass
X-ray binaries because it has showed the unique property of pulsating for only
~150 seconds out of a total observing time of more than 1.5 million seconds.
However, the existing upper limits on the pulsed fraction leave open two
alternatives. Either Aql X-1 has very weak pulses which have been undetected,
or it has genuinely pulsed only for a tiny amount of the observed time.
Understanding which of the two scenarios is the correct one is fundamental to
increase our knowledge about the pulse formation process and understand the
chances we have to detect weak pulses in other LMXBs. In this paper we perform
a semi-coherent search on the entire X-ray data available for Aql X-1. We find
no evidence for (new) weak pulsations with the most stringent upper limits
being of the order of 0.3% in the 7-25 keV energy band.

  Astrophysics with the Square Kilometre Array"" PoS(AASKA14)073",,,,"astro-ph.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Giant Radio Halos (RH) are diffuse, Mpc-sized, synchrotron radio sources
observed in a fraction of merging galaxy clusters. The current scenario for the
origin of RHs assumes that turbulence generated during cluster mergers
re-accelerates pre-existing fossil and/or secondary electrons in the
intra-cluster-medium (ICM) to the energies necessary to produce the observed
radio emission. Moreover, more relaxed clusters could host diffuse ""off state""
halos produced by secondary electrons. In this Chapter we use Monte Carlo
simulations, that combine turbulent-acceleration physics and the generation of
secondaries in the ICM, to calculate the occurrence of RHs in the Universe,
their spectral properties and connection with properties of the hosting
clusters. Predictions for SKA1 surveys are presented at low (100-300 MHz) and
mid (1-2 GHz) frequencies assuming the expected sensitivities and spatial
resolutions of SKA1. SKA1 will step into an unexplored territory allowing us to
study the formation and evolution of RHs in a totally new range of cluster
masses and redshift, allowing firm tests of the current theoretical hypothesis.
In particular, the combination of SKA1-LOW and SUR will allow the discovery of
~1000 ultrasteep- spectrum halos and to detect for the very first time ""off
state"" RHs. We expect that at least ~2500 giant RHs will be discovered by
SKA1-LOW surveys up to z~0.6. Remarkably these surveys will be sensitive to RHs
in a cluster mass range (down to ~10^14 solar masses) and redshifts (up to ~1)
that are unexplored by current observations. SKA1 surveys will be highly
competitive with present and future SZ-surveys in the detection of
high-redshift massive objects.

experiments, not only by measuring the background density of radiation in the
universe, but also by searching for the typical signatures of the fluctuations
of free-streaming species in the temperature and polarisation power spectrum.
Previous studies have already proposed a rather generic parametrisation of
these fluctuations, that could help to discriminate between the signature of
ordinary free-streaming neutrinos, or of more exotic dark radiation models.
Current data are compatible with standard values of these parameters, which
seems to bring further evidence for the existence of a cosmic neutrino
background. In this work, we investigate the robustness of this conclusion
under various assumptions. We generalise the definition of an effective sound
speed and viscosity speed to the case of massive neutrinos or other dark
radiation components experiencing a non-relativistic transition. We show that
current bounds on these effective parameters do not vary significantly when
considering an arbitrary value of the particle mass, or extended cosmological
models with a free effective neutrino number, dynamical dark energy or a
running of the primordial spectrum tilt. We conclude that it is possible to
make a robust statement about the detection of the cosmic neutrino background

attachments must be established between sister chromosomes and microtubules
from opposite spindle poles through kinetochores (chromosome bi-orientation).
Incorrect attachments of kinetochore microtubules (kMTs) lead to chromosome
mis-segregation and aneuploidy, which is often associated with developmental
abnormalities such as Down syndrome and diseases including cancer. The
interaction between kinetochores and microtubules is highly dynamic with
frequent attachments and detachments. However, it remains unclear how
chromosome bi-orientation is achieved with such accuracy in such a dynamic
process.
  Results: To gain new insight into this essential process, we have developed a
simple mathematical model of kinetochore-microtubule interactions during cell
division in general, i.e. both mitosis and meiosis. Firstly, the model reveals
that the balance between attachment and detachment probabilities of kMTs is
crucial for correct chromosome bi-orientation. With the right balance,
incorrect attachments are resolved spontaneously into correct bi-oriented
conformations while an imbalance leads to persistent errors. In addition, the
model explains why errors are more commonly found in the first meiotic division
(meiosis I) than in mitosis and how a faulty conformation can evade the spindle
assembly checkpoint, which may lead to a chromosome loss.
  Conclusions: The proposed model, despite its simplicity, helps us understand
one of the primary causes of chromosomal instability - aberrant
kinetochore-microtubule interactions. The model reveals that chromosome
bi-orientation is a probabilistic self-organization, rather than a
sophisticated process of error detection and correction.

The objective of this paper is to study this family, and, in particular, refine
the knowledge of its cohomology.
  First, we obtain these complexes from the derived images of twists of the
Koszul complex on the projective space. This idea apparently goes back to Kempf
[1970]. Taking this ""geometric"" point of view, we interpret the cohomology of
these complexes as the cohomology of certain vector bundles on the projective
space, and proceed with calculations.
  Finally, we put the above results in the realm of tilting theory:
non-exactness of this family in certain regions can be seen as a failure of the
exceptional sequence of line bundles on the projective space to lift to an
exceptional sequence on a certain vector bundle. This observation creates a
curious contrast with the results of Buchweitz-Leushke-Van den Bergh, stating
that the exceptional sequence of twisted differential forms does lift to an
exceptional sequence on the same vector bundle.

297 region, part of the JCMT Gould Belt Survey of nearby star-forming regions.
Simulations suggest that radiative feedback influences the star-formation
process and we investigate observational evidence for this by constructing
temperature maps. Maps are derived from the ratio of SCUBA-2 fluxes and a two
component model of the JCMT beam for a fixed dust opacity spectral index of
beta = 1.8. Within 40 of the B1.5Ve Herbig star MWC 297, the submillimetre
fluxes are contaminated by free-free emission with a spectral index of
1.03+-0.02, consistent with an ultra-compact HII region and polar winds/jets.
Contamination accounts for 73+-5 per cent and 82+-4 per cent of peak flux at
450micron and 850micron respectively. The residual thermal disk of the star is
almost undetectable at these wavelengths. Young Stellar Objects are confirmed
where SCUBA-2 850micron clumps identified by the fellwalker algorithm coincide
with Spitzer Gould Belt Survey detections. We identify 23 objects and use Tbol
to classify nine YSOs with masses 0.09 to 5.1 Msun. We find two Class 0, one
Class 0/I, three Class I and three Class II sources. The mean temperature is
15+-2K for the nine YSOs and 32+-4K for the 14 starless clumps. We observe a
starless clump with an abnormally high mean temperature of 46+-2K and conclude
that it is radiatively heated by the star MWC 297. Jeans stability provides
evidence that radiative heating by the star MWC 297 may be suppressing clump
collapse.

very important but rare cases in which a formula for a full deformation is

In this paper, we concentrate on deformations of Courant algebroid structures

deformations of the C-bracket and O(d,d)-invariant bilinear form to first order
in the closed string sigma model coupling $\alpha '$ were derived by analyzing
the transformation properties of the Neveu-Schwarz B-field. By choosing a
particular Poisson structure on the Drinfel'd double corresponding to the
Courant algebroid structure of the generalized tangent bundle, we reproduce
these deformations for a specific solution of the strong constraint of DFT as

SPARse Factor Analysis (SPARFA) is a novel framework for machine learning-based
learning analytics, which estimates a learner's knowledge of the concepts
underlying a domain, and content analytics, which estimates the relationships
among a collection of questions and those concepts. SPARFA jointly learns the
associations among the questions and the concepts, learner concept knowledge
profiles, and the underlying question difficulties, solely based on the
correct/incorrect graded responses of a population of learners to a collection
of questions. In this paper, we extend the SPARFA framework significantly to
enable: (i) the analysis of graded responses on an ordinal scale (partial
credit) rather than a binary scale (correct/incorrect); (ii) the exploitation
of tags/labels for questions that partially describe the question{concept
associations. The resulting Ordinal SPARFA-Tag framework greatly enhances the
interpretability of the estimated concepts. We demonstrate using real
educational data that Ordinal SPARFA-Tag outperforms both SPARFA and existing
collaborative filtering techniques in predicting missing learner responses.

bottom-up organic chemistry synthesis with vapour phase epitaxy elongation. We

physics and the valley Hall effect. However, the electron mobility of mono- and
few-layer MoS2 has so far been substantially below theoretically predicted
limits, particularly at low temperature (T), which has hampered efforts to
observe its intrinsic quantum transport behaviors. Potential sources of
disorder and scattering include both defects such as sulfur vacancies in the
MoS2 itself, and extrinsic sources such as charged impurities and remote
optical phonons from oxide dielectrics. To reduce extrinsic scattering and
approach the intrinsic limit, we developed a van der Waals (vdW)
heterostructure device platform where MoS2 layers are fully encapsulated within
hexagonal boron nitride (hBN), and electrically contacted in a multi-terminal
geometry using gate-tunable graphene electrodes. Multi-terminal
magneto-transport measurements show dramatic improvements in performance,
including a record-high Hall mobility reaching 34,000 cm2/Vs for 6-layer MoS2
at low T. Comparison to theory shows a decrease of 1-2 orders of magnitude in
the density of charged impurities, indicating that performance at low T in
previous studies was limited by extrinsic factors rather than defects in the
MoS2. We also observed Shubnikov-de Haas (SdH) oscillations for the first time

therefore opens up a new way toward measurements of intrinsic properties and

the nuclear continuum of the nearby Seyfert 1.9 galaxy MCG -05-23-016 with
unprecedented precision. The high sensitivity of NuSTAR up to 79 keV allows us
to clearly disentangle the spectral curvature of the primary continuum from
that of its reflection component. Using a simple phenomenological model for the
hard X-ray spectrum, we constrain the cut-off energy to $116_{-5}^{+6}$ keV
with 90% confidence. Testing for more complex models and nuisance parameters
that could potentially influence the measurement, we find that the cut-off is
detected robustly. We further use simple Comptonized plasma models to provide
independent constraints for both the kinetic temperature of the electrons in
the corona and its optical depth. At the 90% confidence level, we find
$kT_e=29\pm2$ keV and $\tau_e=1.23\pm0.08$ assuming a slab (disk-like)
geometry, and $kT_e=25\pm2$ keV and $\tau_e=3.5\pm0.2$ assuming a spherical
geometry. Both geometries are found to fit the data equally well and their two
principal physical parameters are correlated in both cases. With the optical
depth in the optically thick regime, the data are pushing the currently
available theoretical models of the Comptonized plasma to the limits of their
validity. Since the spectral features and variability arising from the inner
accretion disk have been observed previously in MCG -05-23-016, the inferred
high optical depth implies that a spherical or disk-like corona cannot be

fundamental task in transcript expression estimation. Where ambiguities in
assignments exist due to transcripts sharing sequence, e.g. alternative
isoforms or alleles, the problem can be solved through probabilistic inference.
Bayesian methods have been shown to provide accurate transcript abundance
estimates compared to competing methods. However, exact Bayesian inference is
intractable and approximate methods such as Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and
Variational Bayes (VB) are typically used. While providing a high degree of
accuracy and modelling flexibility, standard implementations can be
prohibitively slow for large datasets and complex transcriptome annotations.
  Results: We propose a novel approximate inference scheme based on VB and
apply it to an existing model of transcript expression inference from RNA-seq
data. Recent advances in VB algorithmics are used to improve the convergence of
the algorithm beyond the standard Variational Bayes Expectation Maximisation
(VBEM) algorithm. We apply our algorithm to simulated and biological datasets,
demonstrating a significant increase in speed with only very small loss in
accuracy of expression level estimation. We carry out a comparative study
against seven popular alternative methods and demonstrate that our new
algorithm provides excellent accuracy and inter-replicate consistency while
remaining competitive in computation time.

propagate on different metrics, similar to photons in a refractive material

sensitivity (AEFF / TSYS) compared with existing or planned spacecraft tracking
facilities. While this is not traditional radio astronomy, it is an opportunity
for productive synergy between the large investment in the SKA and the even
larger investments in space missions to maximize the total scientific value
returned to society. Specific applications include short-term increases in
downlink data rate during critical mission phases or spacecraft emergencies,
enabling new mission concepts based on small probes with low power and small
antennas, high precision angular tracking via VLBI phase referencing using
in-beam calibrators, and greater range and signal/noise ratio for bi-static
planetary radar observations. Future use of higher frequencies (e.g., 32 GHz
and optical) for spacecraft communications will not eliminate the need for high
sensitivities at lower frequencies. Many atmospheric probes and any spacecraft
using low gain antennas require frequencies below a few GHz. The SKA1 baseline
design covers VHF/UHF frequencies appropriate for some planetary atmospheric
probes (band 1) as well as the standard 2.3 GHz deep space downlink frequency
allocation (band 3). SKA1-MID also covers the most widely used deep space
downlink allocation at 8.4 GHz (band 5). Even a 50% deployment of SKA1-MID will
still result in a factor of several increase in sensitivity compared to the
current 70-m Deep Space Network tracking antennas, along with an advantageous
geographic location. The assumptions of a 10X increase in sensitivity and 20X
increase in angular resolution for SKA result in a truly unique and spectacular
future spacecraft tracking capability.

substructure detection and characterization as such gaps grow with time,
magnifying small perturbations into clear signatures observable by ongoing and
planned Galaxy surveys. To facilitate such future inference, we develop a
comprehensive framework for studies of the growth of the stream density
perturbations. Starting with simple assumptions and restricting to streams on
circular orbits, we derive analytic formulae that describe the evolution of all
gap properties (size, density contrast etc) at all times. We uncover complex,
previously unnoticed behavior, with the stream initially forming a density
enhancement near the subhalo impact point. Shortly after, a gap forms due to
the relative change in period induced by the subhalo's passage. There is an
intermediate regime where the gap grows linearly in time. At late times, the
particles in the stream overtake each other, forming caustics, and the gap
grows like $\sqrt{t}$. In addition to the secular growth, we find that the gap
oscillates as it grows due to epicyclic motion. We compare this analytic model
to N-body simulations and find an impressive level of agreement. Importantly,
when analyzing the observation of a single gap we find a large degeneracy
between the subhalo mass, the impact geometry and kinematics, the host

Universe, in particular, with the detection and study of the earliest

out to the highest redshifts (z~7), many of them exhibiting powerful radio

timescale and support the existence of very high redshift (z > 7) radio loud
sources - sources that have so far escaped detection. Not only would such
detections be paramount to the understanding of the earliest stages of galaxy
evolution, they are necessary for the direct study of neutral hydrogen in the
Epoch of Reionisation, through observations of the HI 21cm forest against such

reported by van Waerbeke and collaborators. The simulations reproduce the weak
lensing-tSZ cross-correlation, $\xi_{y\kappa}(\theta)$, well. The uncertainty
arising from different possible feedback models appears to be important on
small scales only ($\theta \lesssim 10$ arcmin), while the amplitude of the
correlation on all scales is sensitive to cosmological parameters that control
the growth rate of structure (such as $\sigma_8$, $\Omega_m$ and $\Omega_b$).
This study confirms our previous claim (in Ma et al.) that a significant
proportion of the signal originates from the diffuse gas component in low-mass
($M_{\rm{halo}} \lesssim 10^{14} M_{\odot}$) clusters as well as from the
region beyond the virial radius. We estimate that approximately 20$\%$ of the
detected signal comes from low-mass clusters, which corresponds to about 30$\%$
of the baryon density of the Universe. The simulations also suggest that more
than half of the baryons in the Universe are in the form of diffuse gas outside
halos ($\gtrsim 5$ times the virial radius) which is not hot or dense enough to
produce a significant tSZ signal or be observed by X-ray experiments. Finally,
we show that future high-resolution tSZ-lensing cross-correlation observations
will serve as a powerful tool for discriminating between different galactic
feedback models.

used bilinear coupling between the central system and the bath, and permits us
to have a realistic description of both the dissipative central system and its
surrounding bath. We show how to obtain the vibrational properties of a

dynamics by the use of the mapping of the bath vibrational properties onto a
set of auxiliary variables. Our calculations for a model of a Lennard-Jones
solid show that our GLE scheme provides a stable dynamics, with the
dissipative/relaxation processes properly described. The total kinetic energy
of the central system always thermalises toward the expected bath temperature,
with appropriate fluctuation around the mean value. More importantly, we obtain
a velocity distribution for the individual atoms in the central system which
follows the expected canonical distribution at the corresponding temperature.
This confirms that both our GLE scheme and our mapping procedure onto an

algorithm where at each step the (possibly delayed) gradients of only a subset
of component functions are update d. We show that when certain bounds are put
on the level of asynchrony, the proposed algorithm converges to the set of
stationary solutions (resp. optimal solutions) for the nonconvex (resp. convex)
problem. To the best of our knowledge, the proposed ADMM implementation can
tolerate the highest degree of asynchrony, among all known asynchronous
variants of the ADMM. Moreover, it is the first ADMM implementation that can
deal with nonconvexity and asynchrony at the same time.

Many advances have been made by synthesizing gauge fields in cold atomic
systems. Here, we carry over these developments to other platforms which are
extremely well suited for quantum engineering, namely trapped ions and
nano-trapped atoms. Since these systems are typically one-dimensional, the
action of artificial magnetic fields has so far received little attention.
However, exploiting the long-range nature of interactions, loops with
non-vanishing magnetic fluxes become possible even in one-dimensional settings.
This gives rise to intriguing phenomena, such as fractal energy spectra, flat
bands with localized edge states, and topological many-body states. We
elaborate on a simple scheme for generating the required artificial fluxes by
periodically driving an XY spin chain. Concrete estimates demonstrating the
experimental feasibility for trapped ions and atoms in waveguides are given.

Max-pooling act on the hidden layers of the network, reducing their size by an

alternate convolutional layers with max-pooling layers, performance is limited

alpha is allowed to take non-integer values. Our version of max-pooling is
stochastic as there are lots of different ways of constructing suitable pooling

PSBs harbour significant molecular gas and dust reservoirs and residual star
formation, indicating that complete quenching of the starburst due to
exhaustion or expulsion of gas has not occurred during this timespan. As the
starburst ages, we observe a clear decrease in the star-formation efficiency,
molecular gas and SFR surface density, and effective dust temperature, from

reservoir is expelled by stellar winds or AGN feedback. Our results show that

verifying whether the signal originates from annihilating dark matter. In this
paper, we focus on the potential contribution of unresolved point sources, such
as millisecond pulsars (MSPs). We propose that the statistics of the
photons---in particular, the flux probability density function (PDF) of the
photon counts below the point-source detection threshold---can potentially
distinguish between the dark-matter and point-source interpretations. We
calculate the flux PDF via the method of generating functions for these two
models of the excess. Working in the framework of Bayesian model comparison, we
then demonstrate that the flux PDF can potentially provide evidence for an
unresolved MSP-like point-source population.

investigate if the horizontal structures observed in the spectral core of the

structures, and examine their relationship with observables in the H-alpha
line. Methods. Filtergrams in the core of the Ca II H and H-alpha lines as
observed with the Swedish 1-m Solar Telescope are employed. We utilise a
technique that creates composite images and tracks the flash propagation
horizontally. Results. We find 0""15 wide horizontal structures, in all of the
three target sunspots, for every flash where the seeing was moderate to good.
Discrete dark structures are identified that are stable for at least two umbral
flashes, as well as systems of structures that live for up to 24 minutes. We
find cases of extremely extended structures with similar stability, with one
such structure showing an extent of 5"". Some of these structures have a
correspondence in H-alpha but we were unable to find a one to one
correspondence for every occurrence. If the dark streaks are formed at the same
heights as umbral flashes then there are systems of structures with strong
departures from the vertical for all three analysed sunspots. Conclusions.
Long-lived Ca II H filamentary horizontal structures are a common and likely
ever-present feature in the umbra of sunspots. If the magnetic field in the
chromosphere of the umbra is indeed aligned with the structures, then the
present theoretical understanding of the typical umbra needs to be revisited.

highlights that the simulated cluster regions never attain the impressive star

spinning Kerr black hole surrounded by a reflecting mirror may develop
instabilities. The physical mechanism responsible for the development of these
exponentially growing instabilities is the superradiant amplification of
bosonic fields confined between the black hole and the mirror. A remarkable
feature of this composed black-hole-mirror-field system is the existence of a
critical mirror radius, $r^{\text{stat}}_{\text{m}}$, which supports {\it
stationary} (marginally-stable) field configurations. This critical
(`stationary') mirror radius marks the boundary between stable and unstable
black-hole-mirror-field configurations: composed systems whose confining mirror
is situated in the region $r_{\text{m}}<r^{\text{stat}}_{\text{m}}$ are stable
(that is, all modes of the confined field decay in time), whereas composed
systems whose confining mirror is situated in the region
$r_{\text{m}}>r^{\text{stat}}_{\text{m}}$ are unstable (that is, there are
confined field modes which grow exponentially over time). In the present paper
we explore this critical (marginally-stable) boundary between stable and
explosive black-hole-mirror-field configurations. It is shown that the
innermost ({\it smallest}) radius of the confining mirror which allows the
extraction of rotational energy from a spinning Kerr black hole approaches the
black-hole horizon radius in the extremal limit of rapidly-rotating black
holes. We find, in particular, that this critical mirror radius (which marks
the onset of superradiant instabilities in the composed system) scales linearly
with the black-hole temperature.

angular momenta may be changed without inducing significant kinematic heating,
resulting in what has come to be known as radial migration. When radial
migration is very efficient, a large fraction of disk stars experiences
significant, permanent changes to their individual orbital angular momenta over
the lifetime of the disk, having strong implications for the evolution of disk
galaxies. The first step for a star in a spiral disk to migrate radially is to
be captured in a ""trapped"" orbit, associated with the corotation resonance of
the spiral pattern. An analytic criterion for determining whether or not a star
is in a trapped orbit has previously been derived only for stars with zero
random orbital energy in the presence of a spiral with fixed properties. In
this first paper in a series, we derive an analytic criterion appropriate for a
star that is on an orbit of finite random orbital energy. Our new criterion
demonstrates that whether or not a star is in a ""trapped"" orbit primarily
depends on the star's orbital angular momentum. This criterion could be a
powerful tool in the interpretation of the results of N-body simulations. In
future papers of this series, we apply our criterion to explore the physical
parameters important to determining the efficiency of radial migration and its
potential importance to disk evolution.

projected to the position coordinates. Here, I explain some properties of an
origami approximation, in which the sheet does not stretch or contract (an
assumption that is false in general), but is allowed to fold. Even without
stretching, the sheet can form an idealized cosmic web, with convex polyhedral
voids separated by straight walls and filaments, joined by convex polyhedral
nodes. The nodes form in 'polygonal' or 'polyhedral' collapse, somewhat like
spherical/ellipsoidal collapse, except incorporating simultaneous filament and

phase angle with the POLISH2 polarimeter at the Lick Observatory Shane 3-m
telescope, we confirm rotational modulation of linear polarization in $B$ and
$V$ bands. We measure the peak-to-peak modulation in degree of linear
polarization to be $\Delta P = (294 \pm 35) \times 10^{-6}$ (ppm) and
time-averaged $\Delta P / P = 0.0577 \pm 0.0069$. After rotating the plane of
linear polarization to the scattering plane, asteroidal rotational modulation
is detected with $12 \sigma$ confidence and observed solely in Stokes $Q/I$.
POLISH2 simultaneously measures Stokes $I$, $Q$, $U$ (linear polarization), and
$V$ (circular polarization), but we detect no significant circular polarization
with a $1 \sigma$ upper limit of 140 ppm in $B$ band. Circular polarization is
expected to arise from multiple scattering of sunlight by rough surfaces, and
it has previously been detected in nearly all other classes of Solar System
bodies save asteroids. Subsequent observations may be compared with surface
albedo maps from the Dawn Mission, which may allow identification of
compositional variation across the asteroidal surface. These results
demonstrate the high accuracy achieved by POLISH2 at the Lick 3-m telescope,
which is designed to directly detect scattered light from spatially
unresolvable exoplanets.

transients whose sources remain enigmatic. Within the galactic center, the
non-detection of pulsars within the inner $\sim \!10\,{\rm pc}$ has created a
missing pulsar problem that has intensified with time. With all reserve, we
advance the notion that the two problems could be linked by a common solution:
the collapse of neutron stars (NS) due to capture and sedimentation of dark
matter (DM) within their cores. Bramante \& Linden (2014), Phys.\ Rev.\
Lett.~19, 191301 showed that certain DM properties allow for rapid NS collapse
within the high DM density environments near galactic centers while permitting
NS survival elsewhere. Each DM-induced collapse could generate an FRB as the NS
magnetosphere is suddenly expelled. This scenario could explain several
features of FRBs: their short time scales, large energies, locally produced
scattering tails, and high event rates. We predict that FRBs are localized to
galactic centers, and that our own galactic center harbors a large population
of NS-mass ($M\sim1.4 M_\odot$) black holes. The DM-induced collapse scenario
is intrinsically unlikely because it can only occur in a small region of
allowable DM parameter space. However, if observed to occur, it would place
tight constraints on DM properties.

improve our statistics at high redshift. Six different estimators of cool core
strength are applied to these data: the entropy (K) and cooling time
($t_{cool}$) within the cluster core, the cooling time as a fraction of the age
of the Universe ($t_{cool}/t_{Uni}$), and three estimators based on the
cuspiness of the X-ray surface brightness profile. A variety of statistical
tests are used to quantify evolutionary trends in these cool core indicators.
In agreement with some previous studies, we find that there is significant
evolution in $t_{cool}/t_{Uni}$, but little evolution in $t_{cool}$, suggesting
that gas is accumulating within the core, but that the cooling time deep in the

imaging technologies and as an example of a hyperbolic PDE with discontinuous
coefficients. From the perspective of acoustic imaging, the time limited
impulse response at the boundary, or boundary Green's function, represents
measured data, and the objective is to determine coefficients, which encode
physical parameters, from the data. The present paper resolves two fundamental
open problems for layered media: (1) how to compute the time limited Green's
function in the presence of discontinuous coefficients; and (2) to determine
precisely how data depends on coefficients. We show that there exists a single
system of equations in $3n$-dimensional space that governs the parameterized
family of all $n$-layered media simultaneously. The alternate system has smooth
coefficients, can be solved directly by separation of variables, and recovers
the impulse response at the boundary for the original equations. The analysis
brings to light an exotic laplacian---hybrid between the euclidean and
hyperbolic laplacians---that plays a central role in the scattering process.
Its eigenfunctions comprise a new family of orthogonal polynomials on the disk.
These serve as building blocks for a universal wavefield in terms of which the
dependence of data on coefficients has a simple description: reflection data is
obtained by sampling a translate of the wavefield on the integer lattice and
then pushing forward by a linear functional, where the translate and
pushforward correspond to reflectivity and layer depth vectors, respectively.

  actually test?","45 pp",,,,"quant-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Macroscopic Realism (MR) says that a macroscopic system is always
determinately in one or other of the macroscopically distinguishable states
available to it. The Leggett-Garg (LG) inequality was derived to allow
experimental test of whether or not this doctrine is true; it is also often
thought of as a temporal version of a Bell-inequality. Despite recent interest
in the inequality, controversy remains regarding what would be shown by its
violation. Here we resolve this controversy, which arises due to an
insufficiently general and model-independent approach to the question so far.
We argue that LG's initial characterisation of MR does not pick out a
particularly natural realist position, so we articulate an operationally
well-defined and well-motivated position in its place. We show that much weaker
conditions than LG's are sufficient to derive the inequality: in the first
instance, its violation only demonstrates that certain measurements fail to be
non-disturbing at the operational level. We articulate three distinct species
of MR-ist position, and argue that it is only the first of these which can be
refuted by LG inequality violation. This first position is an attractive one,
so ruling it out remains of interest, however. A crucial role is played in LG's
argument by the assumption of noninvasive measurability. We show that this
notion is ambiguous between the weaker notion of disturbance at the operational
level, and the stronger notion of invasiveness at the ontic level of properties
of the system. Ontic noninvasiveness would be required to rule out MR per se
but this property is not entailed by MR, and its presence cannot be established
in a model-independent way. It follows that despite the formal parallels,
Bell's and LG's inequalities are not methodologically on a par. We close with
some reflections on the implications of our analysis for the pedagogy of
quantum superposition.

to assess significances in a rigorous manner. Developing efficient methods to
scan power spectrum likelihoods for oscillatory features, we present results
for the phenomenological bare sine and cosine modulations, allowing validation
against existing Planck Likelihood surveys, as well as templates that include
the correct sharp feature scaling. In particular, we study degeneracies between
feature and cosmological parameters. For frequencies beyond the scale set by
the acoustic peaks, the dependencies are realised through uninteresting
adjustments of the comoving distance to last scattering. Hence, it is
sufficient to keep cosmological parameters fixed and employ fast Gaussian
approximations to the likelihood as a function of the feature model amplitude.
In cases where results can be compared to the literature, our method shows
excellent agreement. We supplement results from the Planck Likelihood with an
analysis based on the Planck SMICA component separation map that, working on
the assumption that the component separation algorithm is reliable, allows for
the inclusion of a larger sky fraction. In principle, this allows us to place
the most stringent constraints to date on the amplitudes of feature models in
the temperature power spectrum. Invoking the WMAP bispectrum, we perform a
combined power spectrum and bispectrum survey. We use and slightly generalise

field topology breakage centered on the Parker Magnetostatic Theorem on a
general incompatibility of a continuous magnetic field with the dual demand of
force free equilibrium and an arbitrarily prescribed, 3D field topology.
Preserving field topology as a global constraint readily results in formation
of tangential magnetic discontinuities, i.e., electric current sheets of zero
thickness. A similar incompatibility is present in the steady, force and
thermal balance of a heated radiating fluid subject to an anisotropic thermal
flux conducted strictly along the frozen in magnetic field in the low beta
limit. In a weakly resistive fluid the thinning of current sheets by these
incompatibilities inevitably results in sheet dissipation, resistive heating
and topological changes in the field despite the small resistivity. Faraday
induction drives but also macroscopically limits this mode of energy
dissipation, storing free energy in self organized, ideal MHD structures. This
property of MHD turbulence captured by the Taylor hypothesis is reviewed in
relation to the Sun's corona, calling for a basic quantitative description of
the breakdown of flux conservation in the low resistivity limit. A cylindrical,

as an observable quantity, but so far direct tests of such a momentum remained
unfruitful. Here, by selective excitation of two sublattices of an artificial

topological charge flipping in otherwise uniform optical beams with Bloch
momentum traversing through the Dirac points. Corroborated by numerical

that pseudospin is not merely for theoretical elegance but rather physically

on the $\tilde{O}(4^n)$ deterministic runtime of the Micciancio Voulgaris
algorithm, henceforth MV, for CVPP (which also solves CVP) at the cost of a
polynomial amount of randomness (which only affects runtime, not correctness).
As in MV, our algorithm proceeds by computing a short path on the Voronoi graph
of the lattice, where lattice points are adjacent if their Voronoi cells share
a common facet, from the origin to a closest lattice vector.
  Our main technical contribution is a randomized procedure that given the
Voronoi relevant vectors of a lattice - the lattice vectors inducing facets of
the Voronoi cell - as preprocessing and any ""close enough"" lattice point to the
target, computes a path to a closest lattice vector of expected polynomial
size. This improves on the $\tilde{O}(4^n)$ path length given by the MV
algorithm. Furthermore, as in MV, each edge of the path can be computed using a
single iteration over the Voronoi relevant vectors. As a byproduct of our work,
we also give an optimal relationship between geometric and path distance on the
Voronoi graph, which we believe to be of independent interest.

a major role in many developmental processes involving structural remodeling
and shape changes. These are achieved by nonequilibrium self-organization
processes that generate functional patterns and drive intracellular transport.
We construct a minimal physical model that incorporates the coupling between
nonlinear elastic responses of individual filaments and force-dependent motor
action. By performing stochastic simulations we show that the interplay of
motor processes, described as driving anti-correlated motion of the network
vertices, and the network connectivity, which determines the percolation
character of the structure, can indeed capture the dynamical and structural
cooperativity which gives rise to diverse patterns observed experimentally. The
buckling instability of individual filaments is found to play a key role in
localizing collapse events due to local force imbalance. Motor-driven
buckling-induced node aggregation provides a dynamic mechanism that stabilizes
the two dimensional patterns below the apparent static percolation limit.
Coordinated motor action is also shown to suppress random thermal noise on
large time scales, the two dimensional configuration that the system starts
with thus remaining planar during the structural development. By carrying out

is a potential mechanism for hydrogen storage. Recent synchrotron x-ray
diffraction experiments [W. I. David et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc. 129, 1594
(2007)] suggest that the transformation between LiNH$_{2}$ and Li$_{2}$NH is a
bulk reaction that occurs through non-stoichiometric processes and involves the
migration of Li$^{+}$ and H$^{+}$ ions. In order to understand the atomistic
mechanisms behind these processes, we carry out comprehensive first-principles
studies of native point defects and defect complexes in the two compounds. We
find that both LiNH$_{2}$ and Li$_{2}$NH are prone to Frenkel disorder on the
Li sublattice. Lithium interstitials and vacancies have low formation energies
and are highly mobile, and therefore play an important role in mass transport
and ionic conduction. Hydrogen interstitials and vacancies, on the other hand,
are responsible for forming and breaking N$-$H bonds, which is essential in the
Li amide/imide reaction. Based on the structure, energetics, and migration of
hydrogen-, lithium-, and nitrogen-related defects, we propose that LiNH$_{2}$
decomposes into Li$_{2}$NH and NH$_{3}$ according to two competing mechanisms
with different activation energies: one mechanism involves the formation of
native defects in the interior of the material, the other at the surface. As a
result, the prevailing mechanism and hence the effective activation energy for
decomposition depend on the surface-to-volume ratio or the specific surface
area, which changes with particle size during ball milling. These mechanisms
also provide an explanation for the dehydrogenation of LiNH$_{2}$+LiH mixtures.

speeds and three different arm strengths. The results are confronted with those
data observed at wavelengths of 8 $\mu$m and 21 cm. In the outer disk, the
ring-like structure observed in 8 $\mu$m image is consistent with the response
of cold neutral medium with an effective sound speed 7 km s$^{-1}$, while for
the inner disk, the presence of spiral shocks can be understood as a result of
4:1 resonances associated with the warm neutral medium with an effective sound
speed 19 km s$^{-1}$. Simulations with single effective sound speed alone
cannot simultaneously explain the structures in the outer and inner disks. This
justifies the coexistence of cold and warm neutral media in M81. The

galaxies. The level of simulated streaming motions narrows down the uncertainty

method we explore is u-optogenetics, which is the application of
sonoluminescence to optogenetics. Such a technique uses ultrasound waves
instead of x-rays to induce light emission, so there would be no introduction
of radiation. However, the penetration depth of ultrasound is less than that of
x-ray. The key issues affecting feasibility are laid out for further
investigation into both x-optogenetics and u-optogenetics.

underpinning fields from biology through chemistry to physics. At its heart is
the quantum wavefunction, the central tool for describing quantum systems. Yet
it is still unclear what the wavefunction actually is: does it merely represent
our limited knowledge of a system, or is it an element of reality? Recent no-go
theorems argued that if there was any underlying reality to start with, the
wavefunction must be real. However, that conclusion relied on debatable
assumptions, without which a partial knowledge interpretation can be maintained
to some extent. A different approach is to impose bounds on the degree to which
knowledge interpretations can explain quantum phenomena, such as why we cannot
perfectly distinguish non-orthogonal quantum states. Here we experimentally
test this approach with single photons. We find that no knowledge
interpretation can fully explain the indistinguishability of non-orthogonal
quantum states in three and four dimensions. Assuming that some underlying
reality exists, our results strengthen the view that the entire wavefunction
should be real. The only alternative is to adopt more unorthodox concepts such
as backwards-in-time causation, or to completely abandon any notion of
objective reality.

specific mechanism for the decomposition and dehydrogenation of LiBH$_{4}$ that
involves mass transport mediated by native defects. In this mechanism,
LiBH$_{4}$ releases borane (BH$_{3}$) at the surface or interface, leaving the
negatively charged hydrogen interstitial (H$_{i}^{-}$) in the material, which
then acts as the nucleation site for LiH formation. The diffusion of
H$_{i}^{-}$ in the bulk LiBH$_{4}$ is the rate-limiting step in the
decomposition kinetics. Lithium vacancies and interstitials have low formation
energies and are highly mobile. These defects are responsible for maintaining
local charge neutrality as other charged defects migrating along the material,
and assisting in the formation of LiH. In light of this mechanism, we discuss
the effects of metal additives on hydrogen desorption kinetics.

volume-suppression of the rate for this process [relative to 2-body decay into
heavy Standard Model (SM) final states ($W/Z/t/H$)] may be partially
compensated by the simplicity of the photon final state. We consider $\gamma_1
\to W^+W^-$, with a typical O(1) branching fraction, and focus on the
semi-leptonic final state $W(\to jj) W(\to \ell, \nu)$ with $\ell=e,\mu$. The
SM background originates from $2\to 3$ parton processes and is relatively
suppressed compared to those for 2-body decays of $G_1$. Moreover, to further
reduce the background, we can impose an invariant mass window cut for
$\gamma_1$ (in addition to that for $G_1$) in this new channel. We emphasize
that this ""photon cascade"" decay probes a different combination of (bulk and
brane) interactions of the KK states than the decays into two heavy SM states.
Thus, in combination with other channels, the cascade decay could be used to
extract the individual underlying geometric parameters. The $3\sigma$ reach for
$G_1$ in our channel is up to 1.5 TeV at the high luminosity (14 TeV) LHC, and
can be extended to about 4 TeV, at $5\sigma$, at a future 100 TeV hadron
collider. Along the way, we point out the novel feature that the invariant mass
distribution of KK graviton decay products becomes skewed from the Breit-Wigner
form, due to the KK graviton coupling growing with energy.

The water retardation (slow diffusion) near the target assists the searching
molecules to recognize the target. Here, we consider effects of the surface on
the diffusivity in three-dimensional diffusion processes, where diffusion on
the surface is slower than that in bulk. We show that the ensemble-averaged
mean square displacements increase linearly with time when the desorption rate
from the surface is finite even when the diffusion on the surface is
subdiffusion. Moreover, this slow diffusion on the surface affects the
fluctuations of the time-averaged mean square displacements (TAMSDs). We find
that fluctuations of the TAMSDs remain large when the measurement time is
smaller than a characteristic relaxation time, and decays according to an
increase of the measurement time for a relatively large measurement time.
Therefore, we find a transition from non-ergodic (distributional) to ergodic
diffusivity in a target search process. Moreover, this fluctuation analysis
provides a method to estimate an unknown surface diffusivity.

may cause spin dephasing during or right after electrical spin injection which
limit spin transport parameters such as the spin lifetime of the whole device.
An important task is to evaluate the quality of the oxide barriers of both spin
injection and detection contacts in a fabricated device. To address this issue,
we discuss the influence of spatially inhomogeneous oxide barriers and
especially conducting pinholes within the barrier on the background signal in
non-local measurements of graphene/MgO/Co spin-valve devices. By both
simulations and reference measurements on devices with non-ferromagnetic
electrodes, we demonstrate that the background signal can be caused by
inhomogeneous current flow through the oxide barriers. As a main result, we
demonstrate the existence of charge accumulation next to the actual spin
accumulation signal in non-local voltage measurements, which can be explained
by a redistribution of charge carriers by a perpendicular magnetic field
similar to the classical Hall effect. Furthermore, we present systematic
studies on the phase of the low frequency non-local ac voltage signal which is
measured in non-local spin measurements when applying ac lock-in techniques.
This phase has so far widely been neglected in the analysis of non-local spin
transport. We demonstrate that this phase is another hallmark of the
homogeneity of the MgO spin injection and detection barriers. We link backgate
dependent changes of the phase to the interplay between the capacitance of the
oxide barrier to the quantum capacitance of graphene.

the U.S. should ""encourage, as appropriate, the deployment of advanced

configurations"". As such, many authors have studied the problem of determining
an optimal set of transmission lines to switch off to minimize the cost of
meeting a given power demand under the direct current (DC) model of power flow.
This problem is known in the literature as the Direct-Current Optimal
Transmission Switching Problem (DC-OTS). Most research on DC-OTS has focused on
heuristic algorithms for generating quality solutions or on the application of
DC-OTS to crucial operational and strategic problems such as contingency
correction, real-time dispatch, and transmission expansion. The mathematical
theory of the DC-OTS problem is less well-developed. In this work, we formally
establish that DC-OTS is NP-Hard, even if the power network is a
series-parallel graph with at most one load/demand pair. Inspired by Kirchoff's
Voltage Law, we give a cycle-based formulation for DC-OTS, and we use the new
formulation to build a cycle-induced relaxation. We characterize the convex
hull of the cycle-induced relaxation, and the characterization provides strong
valid inequalities that can be used in a cutting-plane approach to solve the
DC-OTS. We give details of a practical implementation, and we show promising
computational results on standard benchmark instances.

(2+1)-dimensional quantum field theory that is composed of two interacting
scalar bosons, which represent the order parameters for two continuous phase
transitions. This sort of field theory can describe the competition and
coexistence between distinct long-range orders, and therefore plays a vital
role in statistical physics and condensed matter physics. We first derive and
solve the renormalization group equations of all the relevant physical
parameters, and then show that the system does not have any stable fixed point
in the lowest energy limit. Interestingly, this conclusion holds in both the
ordered and disordered phases, and also at the quantum critical point.
Therefore, the originally continuous transitions are unavoidably turned to
first-order due to ordering competition. Moreover, we examine the impacts of
massless Goldstone boson generated by continuous symmetry breaking on ordering
competition, and briefly discuss the physical implications of our results.

increased production of baryons and strangeness, or recombine into singlet

demonstrate theoretically and numerically that chaotic oscillation and
random-number generation occur in a nanoscale system. The physical system
consists of a pair of quantum dots (QDs), with one QD smaller than the other,
between which energy transfers via optical near-field interactions. When the
system is pumped by continuous-wave radiation and incorporates a timing delay
between two energy transfers within the system, it emits optical pulses. We
refer to such QD pairs as nano-optical pulsers (NOPs). Irradiating an NOP with
external periodic optical pulses causes the oscillating frequency of the NOP to
synchronize with the external stimulus. We find that chaotic oscillation occurs
in the NOP population when they are connected by an external time delay.
Moreover, by evaluating the time-domain signals by statistical-test suites, we
confirm that the signals are sufficiently random to qualify the system as a
random-number generator (RNG). This study reveals that even relatively simple
nanodevices that interact locally with each other through optical energy
transfer at scales far below the wavelength of irradiating light can exhibit
complex oscillatory dynamics. These findings are significant for applications
such as ultrasmall RNGs.

documents, where words are used as feature for training a classifier. This
generally involves a huge number of features. Some techniques, such as Latent
Semantic Analysis (LSA) or Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), have been
designed to summarize documents in a lower dimension with the least semantic
information loss. Some semantic information is nevertheless always lost, since
only words are considered. Instead, we aim at using information coming from
n-grams to overcome this limitation, while remaining in a low-dimension space.
Many approaches, such as the Skip-gram model, provide good word vector
representations very quickly. We propose to average these representations to
obtain representations of n-grams. All n-grams are thus embedded in a same
semantic space. A K-means clustering can then group them into semantic
concepts. The number of features is therefore dramatically reduced and
documents can be represented as bag of semantic concepts. We show that this
model outperforms LSA and LDA on a sentiment classification task, and yields
similar results than a traditional BOW-model with far less features.

role of the magnetic field in modelling the quiescence-outbursts cycle in
Cataclysmic Variables (CVs). The behaviour of the magnetic field is crucial not
only to integrate the disk instability model (Osaki 1974), but also to
determine the cause and effect nexus among parameters affecting the behavior of
complex systems. On the ground of our interpretation of the results emerging
from the literature, we suggest that in models describing DNe outbursts, such
as the disk instability model, the secondary instability model (Bath 1973) and
the thermonuclear runaway model (Mitrofanov 1978), the role of the magnetic
field is at least twofold. On the one hand, it activates a specific dynamic
pathway for the accreting matter by channelling it. On the other hand, it could
be indirectly responsible for switching a particular outburst modality. In
order to represent these two roles of the magnetic field, we need to integrate
the disk instability model by looking at the global behaviour of the system
under analysis. Stochastic resonance in dynamo models, we believe, is a
suitable candidate for accomplishing this task. We shall present the MHD model
including this mechanism elsewhere.

important in order to extract accurate physical information from the
observations. The measured image in a real optical instrument is usually
represented by the convolution of an ideal image with a Point Spread Function
(PSF). Additionally, the image acquisition process is also contaminated by
other sources of noise (read-out, photon-counting). The problem of estimating
both the PSF and a denoised image is called blind deconvolution and is
ill-posed.
  Aims: We propose a blind deconvolution scheme that relies on image
regularization. Contrarily to most methods presented in the literature, our
method does not assume a parametric model of the PSF and can thus be applied to
any telescope.
  Methods: Our scheme uses a wavelet analysis prior model on the image and weak
assumptions on the PSF. We use observations from a celestial transit, where the
occulting body can be assumed to be a black disk. These constraints allow us to
retain meaningful solutions for the filter and the image, eliminating trivial,
translated and interchanged solutions. Under an additive Gaussian noise
assumption, they also enforce noise canceling and avoid reconstruction
artifacts by promoting the whiteness of the residual between the blurred
observations and the cleaned data.
  Results: Our method is applied to synthetic and experimental data. The PSF is
estimated for the SECCHI/EUVI instrument using the 2007 Lunar transit, and for
SDO/AIA using the 2012 Venus transit. Results show that the proposed
non-parametric blind deconvolution method is able to estimate the core of the
PSF with a similar quality to parametric methods proposed in the literature. We
also show that, if these parametric estimations are incorporated in the
acquisition model, the resulting PSF outperforms both the parametric and
non-parametric methods.

Based on loop topology and the form of electroweak presentation of the

these general considerations which leads to neutrino masses via a two-loop
diagram which we dub as ""snail-diagram"". The model has two natural candidates

of the method constitutes an unbiased estimate of the gradient of $f$ and
moreover, the squared norm of the steps goes to zero in expectation, meaning
that the stochastic estimate of the gradient progressively improves. The

for discriminative learning. Recently researchers have also started to show
interest in the generative aspects of CNNs in order to gain a deeper

paper investigates generative modeling of CNNs. The main contributions include:
(1) We construct a generative model for the CNN in the form of exponential

pre-training CNNs by a non-parametric importance sampling scheme, which is
fundamentally different from the commonly used discriminative gradient, and yet
has the same computational architecture and cost as the latter. (3) We propose
a generative visualization method for the CNNs by sampling from an explicit

draw synthetic samples for any given node in a trained CNN by the Hamiltonian
Monte Carlo (HMC) algorithm, without resorting to any extra hold-out images.
Experiments on the challenging ImageNet benchmark show that the proposed

as population genetics and biogeography. These theories are critical by
definition, in the sense that the overall growth rate of each single
allele/species/type vanishes. Thus each species in a neutral model sits at the
edge between invasion and extinction, allowing for the coexistence of
symmetric/neutral types. However, in finite systems, mono-dominated states are
ineludibly reached in relatively short times owing to demographic fluctuations,
thus leaving us with an unsatisfactory framework to rationalize
empirically-observed long-term coexistence. Here, we scrutinize the effect of
heterogeneity in quasi-neutral theories, in which there can be a local mild
preference for some of the competing species at some sites, even if the overall
species symmetry is maintained. As we show here, mild biases at a small
fraction of locations suffice to induce overall robust and durable species
coexistence, even in regions arbitrarily far apart from the biased locations.
This result stems from the long-range nature of the underlying critical bulk
dynamics and has a number of implications, for example, in conservation ecology
as it suggests that constructing local specific ""sanctuaries"" for different
competing species can result in global enhancement of biodiversity, even in
regions arbitrarily distant from the protected refuges.

Unclosed terms are expressed as conditional averages of velocities and heat
diffusion, which are estimated from direct numerical simulations. This

revealing the mean evolution of fluid of different temperatures in different

Rayleigh-B\'enard convection, giving deeper insights into the temperature
statistics and transport mechanisms. We find that the average behaviour is
described by closed cycles in phase space that reconstruct the typical
Rayleigh-B\'enard cycle of fluid heating up at the bottom, rising up to the top
plate, cooling down and falling down again. The detailed behaviour shows subtle
differences between the three cases.

The mass distribution of the fragments follows a power law for small fragments

to search for both narrow resonances and broad deviations from standard model

inverse femtobarns for the dimuon (dielectron) channel. No evidence for
non-standard-model physics is observed and 95% confidence level limits are set
on parameters from a number of new physics models. The narrow resonance
analyses exclude a Sequential Standard Model Z'[SSM] resonance lighter than
2.90 TeV, a superstring-inspired Z'[psi] lighter than 2.57 TeV, and
Randall-Sundrum Kaluza-Klein gravitons with masses below 2.73, 2.35, and 1.27
TeV for couplings of 0.10, 0.05, and 0.01, respectively. A notable feature is
that the limits have been calculated in a model-independent way to enable
straightforward reinterpretation in any model predicting a resonance structure.
The observed events are also interpreted within the framework of two
non-resonant analyses: one based on a large extra dimensions model and one
based on a quark and lepton compositeness model with a left-left isoscalar

the perpendicular transport due to steady-state ITG turbulence on the energy

perpendicular transport in the interior of the island sets the critical island
size needed for growth of neoclassical tearing modes, this increased transport
leads to a critical island size larger than that predicted from considering
collisional conductivities, but smaller than that using anomalous effective
conductivities.
  We find that on Bohm time scales, the turbulence is able to re-establish the
temperature gradient across the island for islands widths $w \lesssim
\lambda_{turb}$, the turbulence correlation length. The reduction in the island
flattening is estimated by comparison with simulations retaining only the
perpendicular temperature and no turbulence. At intermediate island widths,
comparable to $\lambda_{turb}$, turbulence is able to maintain finite

more challenging by the reduced pointing accuracy of the satellite, which has

precise light curves from K2 data, combining list-driven, soft-edged aperture
photometry with a star-by-star correction of systematic effects associated with
the drift in the roll-angle of the satellite about its boresight. The
systematics are modelled simultaneously with the stars' intrinsic variability
using a semi-parametric Gaussian process model. We test this method on a week
of data collected during an engineering test in January 2014, perform checks to
verify that our method does not alter intrinsic variability signals, and
compute the precision as a function of magnitude on long-cadence (30-min) and
planetary transit (2.5-hour) timescales. In both cases, we reach photometric
precisions close to the precision reached during the nominal Kepler mission for
stars fainter than 12th magnitude, and between 40 and 80 parts per million for
brighter stars. These results confirm the bright prospects for planet detection

either angstrom scales of molecules or, for metamaterials, subwavelength
periodic structures. Each material behaves differently in accordance with the
frequency of an incoming electromagnetic wave due to the frequency dispersion
or the resonance of the periodic structures. This indicates that if the
frequency is fixed, the material always responds in the same manner unless it
has nonlinearity. However, such nonlinearity is controlled by the magnitude of
the incoming wave or other bias. Therefore, it is difficult to distinguish
different incoming waves at the same frequency. Here we present a new concept
of circuit-based metasurfaces to selectively absorb or transmit specific types
of waveforms even at the same frequency. The metasurfaces, integrated with
schottky diodes as well as either capacitors or inductors, selectively absorb
short or long pulses, respectively. The two types of the circuit elements are
then combined to absorb or transmit specific waveforms in between. This
waveform selectivity gives us another freedom to control electromagnetic waves
in various fields including wireless communications, as our simulation reveals
that the metasurfaces are capable of varying bit error rates in response to

that can be used to control the properties of DNA nanostructures. One such
motif, which has been used extensively in structures such as polyhedral cages,
two-dimensional arrays, and ribbons, is a bulged duplex, that is two helical
segments that connect at a bulge loop. We use a coarse-grained model of DNA to
characterize such bulged duplexes. We find that this motif can adopt structures
belonging to two main classes: one where the stacking of the helices at the
center of the system is preserved, the geometry is roughly straight and the
bulge is on one side of the duplex, and the other where the stacking at the
center is broken, thus allowing this junction to act as a hinge and increasing
flexibility. Small loops favor states where stacking at the center of the
duplex is preserved, with loop bases either flipped out or incorporated into
the duplex. Duplexes with longer loops show more of a tendency to unstack at
the bulge and adopt an open structure. The unstacking probability, however, is
highest for loops of intermediate lengths, when the rigidity of single-stranded
DNA is significant and the loop resists compression. The properties of this
basic structural motif clearly correlate with the structural behavior of
certain nano-scale objects, where the enhanced flexibility associated with
larger bulges has been used to tune the self-assembly product as well as the
detailed geometry of the resulting nanostructures.

Einstein-Maxwell equations with a negative cosmological constant and a
non-trivial topology. According to the AdS/CFT correspondence, these black
strings are dual to rotating thermal states of a strongly interacting field
theory with nonzero chemical potential that lives in a cylinder. The dynamics
of fluctuations in the field theory can be studied from the perturbation
equations for classical fields in a black-string spacetime. With this
motivation in mind, we develop here a completely gauge and tetrad invariant
perturbation approach to deal with the gravitoelectromagnetic fluctuations of
rotating charged black strings in the presence of sources. As usual, for any
charged black hole, a perturbation in the background electromagnetic field
induces a metric perturbation and vice versa. In spite of this coupling and the
non-vanishing angular momentum, we show that linearization of equations of the
Newman-Penrose formalism leads to four separated second-order complex equations
for suitable combinations of the spin coefficients, the Weyl and the Maxwell
scalars. Then, we generalize the Chandrasekhar transformation theory by the
inclusion of sources and apply it to reduce the perturbation problem to four
decoupled inhomogeneous wave equations --- a pair for each sector of
perturbations. The radial part of such wave equations can be put into
Schrodinger-like forms after Fourier transforming them with respect to time. We
find that the resulting effective potentials form two pairs of supersymmetric
partner potentials and, as a consequence, the fundamental variables of one
perturbation sector are related to the variables of the other sector. The
relevance of such a symmetry in connection to the AdS/CFT correspondence is
discussed, and future applications of the pertubation theory developed here are
outlined.

found that they do not trace near-UV emission. As the latter traces SF on
timescales less than 100 Myr, this rules out any extreme 'prompt' delay-times

within star-forming galaxies is dominated by relatively young progenitors.
Splitting SNe by their (B-V) colours at maximum light, 'redder' events show a
higher degree of association to HII regions and are found more centrally within
hosts. We discuss possible explanations of this result in terms of line of

different temporal and spatial scales. These dynamics are thought to be
important t for efficient neural functioning. Experimental evidence suggests
that these neural dynamics are maintained across a variety of different
cognitive states, in response to alterations of the environment and to changes
in brain configuration (e.g., across individuals, development and in many
neurological disorders). This suggests that the brain has evolved mechanisms to
stabilize dynamics and maintain them across a range of situations. Here, we
employ a local homeostatic inhibitory plasticity mechanism, balancing
inhibitory and excitatory activity in a model of macroscopic brain activity
based on white-matter structural connectivity. We demonstrate that the addition
of homeostatic plasticity regulates network activity and allows for the
emergence of rich, spontaneous dynamics across a range of brain configurations.
Furthermore, the presence of homeostatic plasticity maximises the overlap
between empirical and simulated patterns of functional connectivity. Therefore,
this work presents a simple, local, biologically plausible inhibitory mechanism
that allows stable dynamics to emerge in the brain and which facilitates the
formation of functional connectivity networks.

synchronization, epidemics, evolutionary cooperation, and the control of

validate the method, the internal energy and free energy of an Einstein crystal
are calculated and compared with the analytical solutions. As a preliminary
application, we assess the performance of the method in a realistic model, the
FCC phase of dense atomic hydrogen, in which the calculated result shows that
the acceleration rate is about 3 to 4 fold for a two-level implementation, and
can be increased to 10 times if extrapolation is used. With only 16 beads used
for the ab initio potential sampling, this method gives a well converged
internal energy. The residual error in pressure is just about 3 GPa, whereas it
is about 20 GPa for a plain AI-PIMD calculation with the same number of beads.
The vibrational free energy of the FCC phase of dense hydrogen at 300 K is also
calculated with an AI-PIMD thermodynamic integration method, which gives a
result of about 0.51 eV/proton at a density of $r_{s}=0.912$.

particle in front of a flat wall by evanescent light scattering. To quantify
thermophoretic effects we analyse the nonequilibrium steady state (NESS) of the
particle in a constant temperature gradient perpendicular to the confining
walls. We propose to determine thermophoretic forces from a 'generalized
potential' associated with the probability distribution of the particle
position in the NESS. Experimentally we demonstrate, how this spatial
probability distribution is measured and how thermophoretic forces can be
extracted with 10 fN resolution. By varying temperature gradient and ambient
temperature, the temperature dependence of Soret coefficient $S_T(T)$ is
determined for $r = 2.5 \mu m$ polystyrene and $r = 1.35 \mu m$ melamine
particles. The functional form of $S_T(T)$ is in good agreement with findings
for smaller colloids. In addition, we measure and discuss hydrodynamic effects
in the confined geometry. The theoretical and experimental technique proposed
here extends thermophoresis measurements to so far inaccessible particle sizes

approach to study volume preserving generating differential forms. In

symplectic case, they derived thirty-six one-forms that generate exact volume
preserving maps. Xue and Zanna had studied these differential forms in
connection with the numerical solution of divergence-free differential
equations: can such forms be used to devise new volume preserving integrators
or to further understand existing ones? As a partial answer to this question,
Xue and Zanna showed how six of the generating volume form were naturally
associated to consistent, first order, volume preserving numerical integrators.
In this paper, we investigate and classify the remaining cases. The main result
is the reduction of the thirty-six cases to five essentially different cases,
up to variable relabeling and adjunction. We classify these five cases,
identifying two novel classes and associating the other three to volume
preserving vector fields under a Hamiltonian or Lagrangian representation. We
demonstrate how these generating form lead to consistent volume preserving
schemes for volume preserving vector fields in $\mathbb{R}^3$.

self-consistently over the whole momentum range. In Landau gauge the truncation
of the coupled set of DSEs for the ghost and gluon propagators is improved by
the first full inclusion of the sunset diagram. A solution method which avoids
all overlapping divergences is presented. In the Maximal Abelian gauge a
truncation is developed with respectively one infrared and one ultraviolet
leading diagram included. A first solution of the ghost equation is presented.
In the second part generalizations of the Kugo-Ojima confinement scenario to
other gauges than the linear covariant gauge are investigated. In the
generalized covariant gauge no contradiction is found by using a Faddeev-Popov
conjugation invariant assignment of the asymptotic fields. In the last section
a gauge-independent generalized criterion is developed which allows for the
identification of the Coulomb, Higgs- and confining phases of Yang-Mills theory
in terms of the infrared limit of the Dyson-Schwinger equation of the gauge
boson propagator. While in a Coulomb phase the photon is massless, dominating
the infrared of the equation, in the Higgs phase this equation is dominated by
the physical mass of the gauge boson. In the confining phase the equation is
saturated by unphysical degrees of freedom in the infrared limit only. This
proposal is tested in a variety of gauges and the corresponding unphysical
terms are identified.

which provides a natural extension of the chromatic number of an unsigned

standard temperature and polarization power spectra, taking care to include all
effects which arise from f(R) modifications of both the background and the
perturbation equations. For R^n gravity, we show that for n different from 2,
the initial conditions in the radiation dominated era are the same as those
found in General Relativity. We also find that by doing simulations which
involve either modifying the background evolution while keeping the
perturbation equations fixed or fixing the background to be the Lambda-CDM
model and modifying the perturbation equations, the dominant contribution to
deviations from General Relativity in the temperature and polarization spectra
can be attributed to modifications in the background. This demonstrates the
importance of using the correct background in perturbative studies of f(R)
gravity. Finally an enhancement in the B-modes power spectra is observed which
may allow for lower inflationary energy scales.

conventional SILH Lagrangian, defined as the effective theory of a

obtained as a limiting case of the complete electroweak chiral Lagrangian. The
approach presented here ensures the completeness of the operator basis at the

guarantees a consistent and unambiguous power counting, and it shows how the
generalization of the effective field theory to higher orders in $\xi$ has to

$\xi/16\pi^2$ that are retained, as long as $\xi > 1/16\pi^2$. Conceptual
issues such as custodial symmetry and its breaking are also discussed. For
illustration, the minimal composite Higgs model based on the coset

the equilibrium path. The second is an interim notion, where a player can

address the issue of nested sampling termination and show that a random

departures from spherical symmetry and compute the full form of the chameleon
force, comparing it's shape dependence to that of gravity. Enhancement of the
chameleon force by up to 40% is possible when deforming a sphere to an
ellipsoid of the same mass, with an ellipticity $\simeq 0.99$.

communicate a message to a receiver by transmitting a codeword $\mathbf{x}
=(x_1,\ldots,x_n) \in \{0,1\}^n$ bit by bit via a channel limited to at most
$pn$ corruptions. The channel is ""online"" in the sense that at the $i$th step
of communication the channel decides whether to corrupt the $i$th bit or not
based on its view so far, i.e., its decision depends only on the transmitted
bits $(x_1,\ldots,x_i)$. This is in contrast to the classical adversarial
channel in which the error is chosen by a channel that has a full knowledge on
the sent codeword $\mathbf{x}$.
  In this work we study the capacity of binary online channels for two
corruption models: the {\em bit-flip} model in which the channel may flip at
most $pn$ of the bits of the transmitted codeword, and the {\em erasure} model
in which the channel may erase at most $pn$ bits of the transmitted codeword.
Specifically, for both error models we give a full characterization of the
capacity as a function of $p$.
  The online channel (in both the bit-flip and erasure case) has seen a number
of recent studies which present both upper and lower bounds on its capacity. In
this work, we present and analyze a coding scheme that improves on the
previously suggested lower bounds and matches the previously suggested upper
bounds thus implying a tight characterization.

will pull the contents from the data centre and place them on routers of the

this continuity allows it to be used in hierarchical representation learning,
the learned representations are local: Activation makes a soft selection among

propose the distributed tree where the children use different and independent

transverse energy - MET - signature of squark/gluino production can be
considerably reduced. Instead, a pair of Higgs bosons is produced in each
event. We propose benchmark points for such scenarios, which differ in the
squark and gluino masses, and in their decay cascades. Events for these points
are simulated for the run II of the LHC at 13 TeV centre of mass energy. After
cuts on the transverse momenta of at least four jets, and requiring two
tau-leptons from one Higgs decay, we find that the invariant mass of two b-jets
from the other Higgs decay shows clear peaks above the background. Despite the
reduced MET, this search strategy allows to see signals for sufficiently large
integrated luminosities, depending on the squark/gluino masses.

cases were SClib has been used. In the first set of applications we use SClib
to write a port to Python of a Schr\""odinger equation solver that has been
extensively used the literature, the resulting script presents a speed-up of
about 150x with respect to the original one. A review of the situations where
the speeded-up script has been used is presented. We also describe the solution
to the related problem of solving a set of coupled Schr\""odinger-like equations
where SClib is used to implement the speed-critical parts of the code. We argue
that when using SClib within IPython we can use NumPy and Matplotlib for the
manipulation and visualization of the solutions in an interactive environment
with no performance compromise. The second case is an engineering application.
We use SClib to evaluate the control and system derivatives in a feedback
control loop for electrical motors. With this and the integration routines
available in SciPy, we can run simulations of the control loop a la Simulink.
The use of C code not only boosts the speed of the simulations, but also
enables to test the exact same code that we use in the test rig to get
experimental results. Again, integration with IPython gives us the flexibility

  Complexity-Theoretic Classification","Technical report version of a STACS 2015 paper",,,,"cs.LO cs.CC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Descriptive complexity theory aims at inferring a problem's computational
complexity from the syntactic complexity of its description. A cornerstone of
this theory is Fagin's Theorem, by which a graph property is expressible in
existential second-order logic (ESO logic) if, and only if, it is in NP. A
natural question, from the theory's point of view, is which syntactic fragments
of ESO logic also still characterize NP. Research on this question has
culminated in a dichotomy result by Gottlob, Kolatis, and Schwentick: for each
possible quantifier prefix of an ESO formula, the resulting prefix class either
contains an NP-complete problem or is contained in P. However, the exact
complexity of the prefix classes inside P remained elusive. In the present
paper, we clear up the picture by showing that for each prefix class of ESO
logic, its reduction closure under first-order reductions is either FO, L, NL,
or NP. For undirected, self-loop-free graphs two containment results are
especially challenging to prove: containment in L for the prefix $\exists R_1
\cdots \exists R_n \forall x \exists y$ and containment in FO for the prefix
$\exists M \forall x \exists y$ for monadic $M$. The complex argument by
Gottlob, Kolatis, and Schwentick concerning polynomial time needs to be
carefully reexamined and either combined with the logspace version of
Courcelle's Theorem or directly improved to first-order computations. A
different challenge is posed by formulas with the prefix $\exists M \forall
x\forall y$: We show that they express special constraint satisfaction problems
that lie in L.

surface tension on the growth of the bubble and spike in combined
Rayleigh-Taylor and Kelvin-Helmholtz instability. The nonlinear asymptotic
solutions are obtained analytically for the velocity and curvature of the
bubble and spike tip. We find that the surface tension decreases the velocity
but does not affect the curvature, provided surface tension is greater than a
critical value. For a certain condition, we observe that surface tension
stabilizes the motion. Any perturbation, whatever its magnitude, results stable
with nonlinear oscillations. The nonlinear oscillations depend on surface
tension and relative velocity shear of the two fluids.

  resistance","9 pages, 6 figures","Papers in Physics 6, 060007 (2014)","10.4279/PIP.060007",,"cond-mat.soft","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","  We present a molecular dynamics study of the jamming/unjamming transition in
two-dimensional granular piles with open boundaries. The grains are modeled by
viscoelastic forces, Coulomb friction and resistance to rolling. Two models for
the rolling resistance interaction were assessed: one considers a constant
rolling friction coefficient, and the other one a strain dependent coefficient.
The piles are grown on a finite size substrate and subsequently discharged
through an orifice opened at the center of the substrate. Varying the orifice
width and taking the final height of the pile after the discharge as the order
parameter, one can devise a transition from a jammed regime (when the grain
flux is always clogged by an arch) to a catastrophic regime, in which the pile
is completely destroyed by an avalanche as large as the system size. A finite
size analysis shows that there is a finite orifice width associated with the
threshold for the unjamming transition, no matter the model used for the
microscopic interactions. As expected, the value of this threshold width
increases when rolling resistance is considered, and it depends on the model
used for the rolling friction.
