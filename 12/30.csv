equation on Kerr exterior backgrounds in the general subextremal case |a|<M. In
particular, we prove results corresponding to ""existence and uniqueness of
scattering states"" and ""asymptotic completeness"" and we show moreover that the
resulting ""scattering matrix"" mapping radiation fields on the past horizon and
past null infinity to radiation fields on the future horizon and future null
infinity is a bounded operator. The latter allows us to give a time-domain
theory of superradiant reflection. The boundedness of the scattering matrix
shows in particular that the maximal amplification of solutions associated to
ingoing finite-energy wave packets on past null infinity is bounded. On the
frequency side, this corresponds to the novel statement that the suitably
normalised reflection and transmission coefficients are uniformly bounded
independently of the frequency parameters. We further complement this with a
demonstration that superradiant reflection indeed amplifies the energy radiated
to future null infinity of suitable wave-packets as above. The results make
essential use of a refinement of our recent proof [M. Dafermos, I. Rodnianski
and Y. Shlapentokh-Rothman, Decay for solutions of the wave equation on Kerr
exterior spacetimes III: the full subextremal case |a|<M, arXiv:1402.6034] of
boundedness and decay for solutions of the Cauchy problem so as to apply in the
class of solutions where only a degenerate energy is assumed finite. We show in
contrast that the analogous scattering maps cannot be defined for the class of
finite non-degenerate energy solutions. This is due to the fact that the
celebrated horizon red-shift effect acts as a blue-shift instability when
solving the wave equation backwards.

  spectral graph embedding",,,,,"stat.ML cs.CV cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Data vectors are obtained from multiple domains. They are feature vectors of
images or vector representations of words. Domains may have different numbers
of data vectors with different dimensions. These data vectors from multiple
domains are projected to a common space by linear transformations in order to
search closely related vectors across domains. We would like to find projection
matrices to minimize distances between closely related data vectors. This
formulation of cross-domain matching is regarded as an extension of the
spectral graph embedding to multi-domain setting, and it includes several
multivariate analysis methods of statistics such as multiset canonical
correlation analysis, correspondence analysis, and principal component
analysis. Similar approaches are very popular recently in pattern recognition
and vision. In this paper, instead of proposing a novel method, we will
introduce an embarrassingly simple idea of coding the data vectors for
explaining all the above mentioned approaches. A data vector is concatenated
with zero vectors from all other domains to make an augmented vector. The
cross-domain matching is solved by applying the single-domain version of
spectral graph embedding to these augmented vectors of all the domains. An
interesting connection to the classical associative memory model of neural
networks is also discussed by noticing a coding for association. A
cross-validation method for choosing the dimension of the common space and a
regularization parameter will be discussed in an illustrative numerical
example.

The Green function for the time-independent Schrodinger equation is constructed
from the Green function for the whole line by the method of images;
equivalently, the one-dimensional system is solved exactly in terms of closed
classical paths and periodic orbits. Terms in the energy density and in the
eigenvalue density attributable to the two boundaries individually and those
attributable to the confinement of the field to a finite interval are
distinguished so that their physical origins are clear. Then the pressure is
found similarly from the cylinder kernel, the Green function associated most
directly with an exponential frequency cutoff of the Fourier mode expansion.

masses for use as inertial references in future space-based gravitational wave
detectors. To accomplish this, the Pathfinder spacecraft will perform drag-free
flight about a test mass while measuring the acceleration of this primary test
mass relative to a second reference test mass. Because the reference test mass
is contained within the same spacecraft, it is necessary to apply forces on it
to maintain its position and attitude relative to the spacecraft. These forces
are a potential source of acceleration noise in the LISA Pathfinder system that
are not present in the full LISA configuration. While LISA Pathfinder has been
designed to meet it's primary mission requirements in the presence of this
noise, recent estimates suggest that the on-orbit performance may be limited by
this `suspension noise'. The drift-mode or free-flight experiments provide an
opportunity to mitigate this noise source and further characterize the
underlying disturbances that are of interest to the designers of LISA-like
instruments. This article provides a high-level overview of these experiments
and the methods under development to analyze the resulting data.

neuron firing, and communication patterns among humans --- can be described
using inter-event time (IET) distributions. Many such processes are ongoing,
although event sequences are only available during a finite observation window.
Because the observation time window is more likely to begin or end during long
IETs than during short ones, the analysis of such data is susceptible to a bias
induced by the finite observation period. In this paper, we illustrate how this
length bias is born and how it can be corrected without assuming any particular
shape for the IET distribution. To do this, we model event sequences using
stationary renewal processes, and we formulate simple heuristics for
determining the severity of the bias. To illustrate our results, we focus on
the example of empirical communication networks, which are temporal networks
that are constructed from communication events. The IET distributions of such
systems guide efforts to build models of human behavior, and the variance of
IETs is very important for estimating the spreading rate of information in
networks of temporal interactions. We analyze several well-known data sets from
the literature, and we find that the resulting bias can lead to systematic
underestimates of the variance in the IET distributions and that correcting for
the bias can lead to qualitatively different results for the tails of the IET
distributions.

forces induced through a bias voltage (or gate voltage) were used to manipulate
the interaction of freestanding graphene with a tip (substrate). Such forces
can cause large movements and sudden changes in curvature through mirror
buckling. Here we explore an alternative mechanism, thermal load, to control
the curvature of graphene. We demonstrate thermal mirror buckling of graphene
by scanning tunneling microscopy and large-scale molecular dynamic simulations.
The negative thermal expansion coefficient of graphene is an essential

dimension from the topological spatial dimension $d$ at large length scales to
some smaller value at small, Planckian scales. While the origin of such a flow
is well understood in continuum approaches, in theories built on discrete
structures a firm control of the underlying mechanism is still missing. We shed
some light on the issue by presenting a particular class of quantum geometries
with a flow in the spectral dimension, given by superpositions of states
defined on regular complexes. For particular superposition coefficients
parametrized by a real number $0<\alpha<d$, we find that the spatial spectral
dimension reduces to $d_s \simeq \alpha$ at small scales. The spatial Hausdorff
dimension of such class of states varies between 1 and $d$, while the walk
dimension takes the usual value $d_w=2$. Therefore, these quantum geometries
may be considered as fractal only when $\alpha=1$, where the ""magic number""
${d_s}^{\rm spacetime}\simeq 2$ for the spectral dimension of space\emph{time},
appearing so often in quantum gravity, is reproduced as well. These results
apply, in particular, to special superpositions of spin-network states in loop

structure of the complete graph K(P) as a geometric graph includes, for any
pair [a,b],[c,d] of vertex-disjoint edges, the information whether they cross

  The simple (i.e., non-crossing) spanning trees (SSTs) of K(P) are the
vertices of the so-called Geometric Tree Graph of P, G(P). Two such vertices
are adjacent in G(P) if they differ in exactly two edges, i.e., if one can be
obtained from the other by deleting an edge and adding another edge.
  In this paper we show how to reconstruct from G(P) (regarded as an abstract
graph) the structure of K(P) as a geometric graph. We first identify within
G(P) the vertices that correspond to spanning stars. Then we regard each star
S(z) with center z as the representative in G(P) of the vertex z of K(P). (This
correspondence is determined only up to an automorphism of K(P) as a geometric
graph.) Finally we determine for any four distinct stars S(a), S(b), S(c), and
S(d), by looking at their relative positions in G(P), whether the corresponding
segments cross.

state when the as-prepared sample crosses the PM-FM transition for the first
time. This additional transformation is irreversible around the transition
temperature and increases the energy barrier which needs to be overcome through
the PM-FM transition. Consequently the transition temperature on first cooling
is found to be lower than on subsequent cycles characterizing the so-called
virgin effect. High temperature annealing can restore the cycled sample to the
high-temperature metastable state, which leads to the recovery of the virgin

equivalent to the conventional cosmological perturbations in the

connections between the exact and perturbative (linear or no-linear) approach

calculations for materials with strong electronic Coulomb correlations. The
discussion focuses on developments beyond the by now well established
combination of density functional and dynamical mean field theory dubbed
""LDA+DMFT"". It is organized around the description of dynamical screening
effects in the solid. Indeed, screening in the solid gives rise to dynamical
local Coulomb interactions U(w) (Aryasetiawan et al 2004 Phys. Rev. B 70
195104), and this frequency-dependence leads to effects that cannot be
neglected in a truly first principles description. We review the recently
introduced extension of LDA+DMFT to dynamical local Coulomb interactions
""LDA+U(w)+DMFT"" (Casula et al. Phys. Rev. B 85 035115 (2012), Werner et al.
Nature Phys. 8 331 (2012)). A reliable description of dynamical screening
effects is also a central ingredient of the ""GW+DMFT"" scheme (Biermann et al.
Phys. Rev. Lett. 90 086402 (2003)), a combination of many-body perturbation
theory in Hedin's GW approximation and dynamical mean field theory. Recently,
the first GW+DMFT calculations including dynamical screening effects for real
materials have been achieved, with applications to SrVO3 (Tomczak et al.
Europhys. Lett. 100 67001 (2012); Phys. Rev. B 90 165138 (2014)) and adatom
systems on surfaces (Hansmann et al. Phys. Rev. Lett. 110 166401 (2013)). We
review these and comment on further perspectives in the field. This review is
an attempt to put elements of the original works (Refs. 1-11) into the broad
perspective of the development of truly first principles techniques for
correlated electron materials.

for such study is the computation of mobility patterns summarizing how

foster the development of such applications in a privacy-preserving manner, we

counting the number of mobile service users moving from one area (region) to

similar to another method (linear counting sketch) that does not provide any

main detection channels for supernova $\nu_e$ in a liquid scintillator are its
elastic scattering with electrons and its charged-current interaction with the

from these interactions are too small to be very useful. However, at the
20-kton scale planned for the new detectors, these channels become powerful
tools for probing the $\nu_e$ emission. We find that the $\nu_e$ spectrum can
be well measured, to better than $\sim 40\%$ precision for the total energy and
better than $\sim 25\%$ precision for the average energy. This is adequate to
distinguish even close average energies, e.g., 11 MeV and 14 MeV, which will
test the predictions of supernova models. In addition, it will help set
constraints on neutrino mixing effects in supernovae by testing non-thermal
spectra. Without such large liquid scintillator detectors (or Super-Kamiokande
with added gadolinium, which has similar capabilities), supernova $\nu_e$ will
be measured poorly, holding back progress on understanding supernovae,
neutrinos, and possible new physics.

Reshetnyak, arXiv:1406.5086[hep-th]], devoted to Lagrangian quantization for
gauge theories with soft BRST symmetry breaking, in particular, for various
descriptions of the YM theory without Gribov copies. The cited works rely on
finite BRST and BRST-antiBRST transformations, respectively, with a singlet
$\Lambda$ and a doublet $\lambda_{a}$, $a=1,2$, of anticommuting Grassmann
parameters, both global and field-dependent. It turns out that global finite
BRST and BRST-antiBRST transformations form a 1-parametric and a 2-parametric
Abelian supergroup, respectively. Explicit superdeterminants corresponding to
these changes of variables in the partition function allow one to calculate
precise changes of the respective gauge-fixing functional. These facts provide
the basis for a proof of gauge independence of the corresponding path integral
under respective BRST and BRST-antiBRST transformations. It is shown that the
gauge independence becomes restored for path integrals with soft BRST and
BRST-antiBRST symmetry breaking terms. In this case, the form of transformation
parameters is found to induce a precise change of the gauge in the path
integral, thus connecting two arbitrary $R_{\xi}$-like gauges in the average
effective action. Finite field-dependent BRST-antiBRST transformations are used
to solve (perturbatively) the Gribov problem in the Gribov--Zwanziger approach.
A modification of the path integral for theories with a gauge group, being
consistent with gauge invariance and providing a restriction of the integration
measure to the first Gribov region with a non-vanishing Faddeev--Popov
determinant, is suggested.

(WL), galaxy clustering, baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) and redshift space
distortions (RSD). We find, contrary to some findings in the recent literature,
that overlapping surveys can give important benefits when measuring dark
energy. We therefore try to clarify the status of this issue with a full
forecast of two stage-IV surveys using a new approach to properly account for
covariance between the different probes in the overlapping samples. The benefit
of the overlapping survey can be traced back to two factors: additional
observables and sample variance cancellation. Both needs to be taken into
account and contribute equally when combining 3D power spectrum and 2D
correlations for lensing. With an analytic example we also illustrate that for
optimal constraints, one should minimize the (Pearson) correlation coefficient
between cosmological and nuisance parameters and maximize the one among
nuisance parameters (e.g. galaxy bias) in the two samples. This can be achieved
by increasing the overlap between the spectroscopic and photometric surveys. We
show how BAO, WL and RSD contribute to this benefit and also look at some other
survey designs, such as photometric redshift errors and spectroscopic density.

circumstantial evidence exists of the fact that supernovae in our Galaxy play a
crucial role in producing the bulk of cosmic rays observed on Earth. On the
other hand, important questions about their ability to accelerate particles up
to the knee remain unanswered. The common interpretation of the knee as a
feature coinciding with the maximum energy of the light component of cosmic
rays and a transition to a gradually heavier mass composition is mainly based
on KASCADE results. Some recent data appear to question this finding: YAC1 -
Tibet Array and ARGO-YBJ find a flux reduction in the light component at $\sim
700$ TeV, appreciably below the knee. Whether the maximum energy of light
nuclei is as high as $3000$ TeV or rather as low as a few hundred TeV has very
important consequences on the supernova remnant paradigm for the origin of
cosmic rays, as well on the crucial issue of the transition from Galactic to
extragalactic cosmic rays. In such a complex phenomenological situation, it is
important to have a clear picture of what is really known and what is not. Here
I will discuss some solid and less solid aspects of the theory (or theories)

conjectured expression is a spectral expansion which uses the exact form
factors and the excited state thermodynamic Bethe Ansatz as building blocks.
The conjecture is proven for the case of the trace of the energy-moment tensor.
Concerning its validity for more general operators, we provide numerical
evidence using the truncated conformal space approach. It is found that the
expansion fails to be well-defined for small values of the volume in cases when
the singularity structure of the TBA equations undergoes a non-trivial
rearrangement under some critical value of the volume. Despite these
shortcomings, the conjectured expression is expected to be valid for all
volumes for most of the excited states, and as an expansion above the critical
volume for the rest.

important social media for sharing one's thoughts without the fear of being
judged by friends, family, or the public. Further, such anonymous platforms are
crucial in nations with authoritarian governments; the right to free expression
and sometimes the personal safety of the author of the message depend on
anonymity. Whether for fear of judgment or personal endangerment, it is crucial
to keep anonymous the identity of the user who initially posted a sensitive
message. In this paper, we consider an adversary who observes a snapshot of the
spread of a message at a certain time. Recent advances in rumor source
detection shows that the existing messaging protocols are vulnerable against
such an adversary. We introduce a novel messaging protocol, which we call
adaptive diffusion, and show that it spreads the messages fast and achieves a
perfect obfuscation of the source when the underlying contact network is an
infinite regular tree: all users with the message are nearly equally likely to
have been the origin of the message. Experiments on a sampled Facebook network
show that it effectively hides the location of the source even when the graph
is finite, irregular and has cycles. We further consider a stronger adversarial
model where a subset of colluding users track the reception of messages. We
show that the adaptive diffusion provides a strong protection of the anonymity
of the source even under this scenario.

giant planets in scattered optical light with a space based coronagraph. First,
for a number of the known radial velocity (RV) giants we computed traditional
forward models of their atmospheric structure and clouds, given various input
assumptions, and computed model albedo spectra. Such models have been computed
before, but mostly for generic planets. Our new models demonstrate that there
is likely interesting spectral diversity among those planets that are most
favorable for direct detection. Second, we applied a powerful Markov Chain
Monte Carlo (MCMC) retrieval technique to synthetic noisy data of cool giants
to better understand how well various atmospheric parameters--particularly
molecular abundances and cloud properties--could be constrained. This is the
first time such techniques have been applied to this problem. The process is
time consuming, so only a dozen or so cases could be completed in the limited
time available. Nevertheless the results clearly show that even at S/N ~ 5,
scientifically interesting and valuable conclusions can be drawn about the
properties of giant planet atmospheres from noisy spectra. We find that
atmospheric abundances are best constrained when the planet gravity is bounded.
Thus direct imaging observations of known radial velocity planets are extremely
valuable as limits on a target planet's gravity can be obtained from
astrometric imaging and reflectivity and mass-radius relationship arguments
(for mass and radius, respectively). Further retrieval studies are clearly
warranted and would be valuable to help guide instrument design decisions.

considered. One or more genes randomly switch between regulatory states, each
having a different mRNA transcription rate. The gene or genes are self
regulating when the proteins they produce affect the rate of switching between
regulatory states. Under weak noise conditions, the deterministic forces are
much stronger than fluctuations from gene switching and protein synthesis.
Metastable transitions, such as bistable switching, can occur under weak noise
conditions, causing dramatic shifts in the expression of a gene. A general tool
used to describe metastability is the quasi stationary analysis (QSA). A large
deviation principle is derived so that the QSA can explicitly account for
random gene switching without using an adiabatic limit or diffusion
approximation, which are unreliable and inaccurate for metastable events.This
allows the existing asymptotic and numerical methods that have been developed
for continuous Markov processes to be used to analyze the full model.

universal, nearly linear entropy radial profile $K(r)$. Using deprojected 16
clusters and 12 groups from the literature, we find that $K\propto
r^{0.96\pm0.01}$, consistent with the mean power-law index $(0.9\mbox{--}1.1)$
of previous studies. A similarly good fit is given by a $\tau\propto
r^{0.72\pm0.01}$ ratio between cooling and free-fall times. Both profiles
slightly flatten at small radii, as $\tau$ becomes of order unity. The entropy
profile is usually attributed to self-similar shock accretion (shown to be
inconsistent with the data), to non-standard heat conduction, or to turbulent
heating. We argue that a dynamical mechanism is needed to sustain such a
universal profile, oblivious to the temperature peak at the edge of the core
and to the virial shock at the outskirts, and robust to the presence of ongoing
cooling, merger, and active galactic nucleus (AGN) activity. In particular, we
show that such a profile can be naturally obtained in a spiral flow, which is
likely to underlie most galaxy aggregates according to the ubiquitous spiral
patterns and cold fronts observed. Generalizing a two-phase spiral flow model
out to the virial radius surprisingly reproduces the thermal profile. A
generalized Schwarzschild criterion indicates that observed spiral patterns
must involve a convective layer, which may regulate the thermal profile.

which the final theory has to be adjusted. In this paper, we suggest, within a
much simpler setting, that this kind of reasoning can actually be reversed, by
taking an operational approach inspired by quantum information theory. We
consider observers in distinct laboratories, with local physics described by
the laws of abstract quantum theory, and without presupposing a particular
spacetime structure. We ask what information-theoretic effort the observers
have to spend to synchronize their descriptions of local physics. If there are
""enough"" observables that can be measured universally on several different
quantum systems, we show that the observers' descriptions are related by an
element of the orthochronous Lorentz group O^+(3,1), together with a global
scaling factor. Not only does this operational approach predict the Lorentz
transformations, but it also accurately describes the behavior of relativistic
Stern-Gerlach devices in the WKB approximation, and it correctly predicts that
quantum systems carry Lorentz group representations of different spin. This
result thus hints at a novel information-theoretic perspective on spacetime.

qubits in the steady state. We discuss the general theory behind such a scheme,
and present an example of how it can be used to drive a register of N atoms to
a generalized W state and how the entanglement can be sustained indefinitely.
The achievable steady-state fidelities for entanglement and its scaling with
the number of qubits are discussed for presently existing superconducting
quantum circuits. While the protocol is primarily discussed for a
superconducting circuit architecture, it is ideally realized in any Cavity QED
platform that permits controllable delivery of coherent electromagnetic
radiation to specified locations.

determined by an ""amplitude form"" with logarithmic singularities on the
boundary of the amplituhedron. In this note we provide strong evidence for a
new striking property of the superamplitude, which we conjecture to be true to
all loop orders: the amplitude form is positive when evaluated inside the
amplituhedron. The statement is sensibly formulated thanks to the natural
""bosonization"" of the superamplitude associated with the amplituhedron
geometry. However this positivity is not manifest in any of the current
approaches to scattering amplitudes, and in particular not in the cellulations
of the amplituhedron related to on-shell diagrams and the positive
grassmannian. The surprising positivity of the form suggests the existence of a
""dual amplituhedron"" formulation where this feature would be made obvious. We
also suggest that the positivity is associated with an extended picture of
amplituhedron geometry, with the amplituhedron sitting inside a co-dimension
one surface separating ""legal"" and ""illegal"" local singularities of the
amplitude. We illustrate this in several simple examples, obtaining new
expressions for amplitudes not associated with any triangulations, but
following in a more invariant manner from a global view of the positive

The minimal model, assuming first order Born scattering by random quenched

lower (by a factor of 3 or more) than that observed experimentally in many
ultra high-mobility modulation-doped 2D systems, establishing convincingly that
the model of uncorrelated scattering by independent random remote quenched
dopant ions is often unable to describe the physical system quantitively. We
theoretically establish that the consideration of spatial correlations in the
remote dopant distribution can enhance the mobility by (up to) several orders
of magnitudes in experimental samples. The precise calculation of the carrier
mobility in ultra-pure modulation-doped 2D semiconductor structures thus
depends crucially on the unknown spatial correlations among the dopant ions in
the doping layer which may manifest sample to sample variations even for
nominally identical sample parameters (i.e., density, well width, etc.),
depending on the details of the modulation-doping growth conditions.

calculations to date have shown qualitatively similar features, there exist
subtle differences which can lead to important consequences in the device
characteristics. For example, most calculations have shown that all single

quasiparticle gaps, corresponding to large variations in exciton binding

have revealed detailed quasiparticle electronic structures in TMDs, including
the quasi-particle gaps, critical point energy locations and their origins in
the Brillouin Zones (BZs). We show that $SL-WSe_2$ actually has an indirect
quasi-particle gap with the conduction band minimum located at the Q point

that undergo twinning and structural phase transformations. Continuum models
fall into two classes: sharp-interface models, where interfaces are singular
surfaces; and regularized-interface models, such as phase-field models, where
interfaces are smeared out. The former are challenging for numerical solutions
because the interfaces need to be explicitly tracked, but have the advantage
that the kinetics of existing interfaces and the nucleation of new interfaces
can be transparently and precisely prescribed. In contrast, phase-field models
do not require explicit tracking of interfaces, thereby enabling relatively
simple numerical calculations, but the specification of kinetics and nucleation
is both restrictive and extremely opaque. This prevents straightforward
calibration of phase-field models to experiment and/or molecular simulations,
and breaks the multiscale hierarchy of passing information from atomic to
continuum.
  We present the formulation of a phase-field model -- i.e., a model with
regularized interfaces that do not require explicit numerical tracking -- that
allows for easy and transparent prescription of complex interface kinetics and
nucleation. The key ingredients are a re-parametrization of the energy density
to clearly separate nucleation from kinetics; and an evolution law that comes
from a conservation statement for interfaces. This enables clear prescription
of nucleation through the source term of the conservation law and of kinetics
through an interfacial velocity field. A formal limit of the kinetic driving
force recovers the classical continuum sharp-interface driving force, providing
confidence in both the re-parametrized energy and the evolution statement.
  We present a number of numerical calculations in one and two dimensions to
characterize and demonstrate the formulation.

classical molecular dynamics simulations with 51200 and 409600 nucleons, that
are run on GPUs. We expand our simulation region to decompress systems from an

language properties. More specifically, the so-called word adjacency model has
been proven useful for tackling several practical problems, especially those
relying on textual stylistic analysis. The most common approach to treat texts
as networks has simply considered either large pieces of texts or entire books.
This approach has certainly worked well -- many informative discoveries have
been made this way -- but it raises an uncomfortable question: could there be
important topological patterns in small pieces of texts? To address this
problem, the topological properties of subtexts sampled from entire books was
probed. Statistical analyzes performed on a dataset comprising 50 novels
revealed that most of the traditional topological measurements are stable for
short subtexts. When the performance of the authorship recognition task was
analyzed, it was found that a proper sampling yields a discriminability similar
to the one found with full texts. Surprisingly, the support vector machine
classification based on the characterization of short texts outperformed the
one performed with entire books. These findings suggest that a local
topological analysis of large documents might improve its global
characterization. Most importantly, it was verified, as a proof of principle,
that short texts can be analyzed with the methods and concepts of complex
networks. As a consequence, the techniques described here can be extended in a
straightforward fashion to analyze texts as time-varying complex networks.

invariant is always physical there are examples of chiral CFTs for which the
diagonal modular invariant is not physical. Here we give (in group theoretical
terms) a necessary and sufficient condition for diagonal modular invariants of
$G$-orbifolds of holomorphic conformal field theories to be physical.
  Mathematically a physical modular invariant is an invariant of a Lagrangian
algebra in the product of (chiral) modular categories. The chiral modular
category of a $G$-orbifold of a holomorphic conformal field theory is the
so-called (twisted) Drinfeld centre ${\cal Z}(G,\alpha)$ of the finite group
$G$. We show that the diagonal modular invariant for ${\cal Z}(G)$ is physical

$x,y\in G$ there is $g\in G$ such that $\phi(x) = gx^{-1}g^{-1},\ \phi(y) =

states in a non-relativistic ""radial quantization"" Hilbert space. Our results
include: a determination of the OPE coefficients of descendant operators in
terms of those of the underlying primary state, a demonstration of convergence
of the (imaginary time) OPE in certain kinematic limits, and an estimate of the
decay rate of the OPE tail inside matrix elements which, as in relativistic
CFTs, depends exponentially on operator dimensions. To illustrate our results
we consider several examples, including a strongly interacting field theory of
bosons tuned to the unitarity limit, as well as a class of holographic models.
Given the similarity with known statements about the OPE in SO(2,d) invariant

constraining NRCFTs, with applications to bound state spectra and interactions.

recurrent nova systems satisfied the screening criterion. To determine what
fraction of these novae are indeed recurrent the original plates and published
images of the relevant eruptions have been carefully compared. This procedure
has resulted in the elimination of 27 of the 51 progenitor candidates (61

systematic error to pQCD predictions, leading to the well-known renormalization
scheme and scale ambiguities. As a practical solution for such scale setting
problem, the ""Principle of Minimum Sensitivity"" (PMS), has been proposed in the
literature. The PMS suggests to determine an optimal scale for the pQCD
approximant of an observable by requiring its slope over the scheme and scale
changes to vanish. In the paper, we present a detailed discussion on general
properties of PMS by utilizing three quantities $R_{e^+e^-}$, $R_\tau$ and
$\Gamma(H\rightarrow b\bar{b})$ up to four-loop QCD corrections. After applying
the PMS, the accuracy of pQCD prediction, the pQCD convergence, the pQCD
predictive power and etc., have been discussed. Furthermore, we compare PMS
with another fundamental scale setting approach, i.e. the Principle of Maximum
Conformality (PMC)... Our results show that PMS does provide a practical way to
set the effective scale for high-energy process, and the PMS prediction agrees
with the PMC one by including enough high-order QCD corrections, both of which
shall be more accurate than the prediction under the conventional scale
setting. However, the PMS pQCD convergence is an accidental, which usually
fails to achieve a correct prediction of unknown high-order contributions with
next-to-leading order QCD correction only, i.e. it is always far from the

""free choice of measurements"", a condition on hidden-variable theories which is
needed to make no-go theorems such as Bell's theorem non-trivial. More
precisely, we shall show that a probability table describing measurement

Lambda-Independent hidden-variable theory of a particular canonical form, in

with Bell's theorem is that we consider hidden-variable theories with signed

Negative probabilities have often been discussed in the literature on quantum

they give rise to, and indeed characterize, the entire class of No-Signalling

Pawlowski & Brukner, Phys. Rev. Lett. 102, 030403 (2009)]. More specifically,
we show that, provided the number of particles in each site is large enough
compared to the number of allowed measurement settings, and whatever the
microscopic state of the system, the macroscopic average behaviour is local
realistic, or equivalently, general multipartite monogamy relations hold.
  This result relies on a classical mathematical theorem by Vorob'ev [Theory
Probab. Appl. 7(2), 147-163 (1962)] about extending compatible families of
probability distributions defined on the faces of a simplicial complex -- in
the language of the sheaf-theoretic framework of Abramsky & Brandenburger [New
J. Phys. 13, 113036 (2011)], such families correspond to no-signalling
empirical models, and the existence of an extension corresponds to locality or
non-contextuality. Since Vorob'ev's theorem depends solely on the structure of
the simplicial complex, which encodes the compatibility of the measurements,
and not on the specific probability distributions (i.e. the empirical models),
our result about monogamy relations and locality of macroscopic averages holds
not just for quantum theory, but for any empirical model satisfying the
no-signalling condition.
  In this extended abstract, we illustrate our approach by working out a couple
of examples, which convey the intuition behind our analysis while keeping the
discussion at an elementary level.

in the foundations of quantum mechanics concerning the nature of the
wavefunction within the scope of more logical and structural methods. A first
step involves dualising a criterion for the reality of the wavefunction
proposed by Harrigan & Spekkens, which was central to the Pusey-Barrett-Rudolph
theorem. The resulting criterion has several advantages, including the
avoidance of certain technical difficulties relating to sets of measure zero.
By considering the 'reality' not of the wavefunction but of the observable
properties of any ontological physical theory a new characterisation of
non-locality and contextuality is found. Secondly, a careful analysis of
preparation independence, one of the key assumptions of the PBR theorem, leads
to a precise analogy with the kind of locality prohibited by Bell's theorem.
Motivated by this, we propose a weakening of the assumption to something
analogous to no-signalling. This amounts to allowing global or non-local
correlations in the joint ontic state, which nevertheless do not allow for
superluminal signalling. This is, at least, consistent with the Bell and
Kochen-Specker theorems. We find a counter-example to the PBR argument, which
violates preparation independence, but does satisfy this physically motivated
assumption. The question of whether the PBR result can be strengthened to hold
under the relaxed assumption is therefore posed.

the biggest challenges in going beyond simple rewriting-based proofs is
designing a graphical language that is expressive enough to prove interesting

entire families of diagrams. One candidate is the language of !-graphs, which
consist of graphs with certain subgraphs marked with boxes (called !-boxes)
that can be repeated any number of times. New !-graph equations can then be
proved using a powerful technique called !-box induction. However, previously
this technique only applied to commutative (or cocommutative) algebraic
structures, severely limiting its applications in some parts of CQM and

a new semantics for non-commutative !-graphs using an enriched version of

nonparametric analysis of such heterogeneous treatment effects and their
measurement in relation to observable covariates. New results and algorithms
are provided for quantifying the uncertainty associated with treatment effect
measurement via both linear projections and nonlinear regression trees (CART
and Random Forests). For linear projections, our inference strategy leads to
results that are mostly in agreement with those from the frequentist
literature. We find that linear regression adjustment of treatment effect
averages (i.e., post-stratification) can provide some variance reduction, but
that this reduction will be vanishingly small in the low-signal and
large-sample setting of digital experiments. For regression trees, we provide
uncertainty quantification for the machine learning algorithms that are

because computing the test log-probabilities requires the intractable partition

prone to overestimate the log-likelihood with little indication that anything

RAISE requires only the same MCMC transition operators as standard AIS.

show that the SSP games have strong optimality properties, including the
existence of a unique solution to the dynamic programming equation, the
existence of optimal stationary policies, and the convergence of value and

a model-free, asynchronous stochastic iterative algorithm. By the theory of
stochastic approximation involving monotone nonexpansive mappings, it is known
to converge when its associated dynamic programming equation has a unique

conjectured the same singularity properties hold to all loop orders in the

has poles at infinity, at least at four points it has only logarithmic
singularities at finite locations. We provide nontrivial evidence for these
conjectures. For the three-loop four-point N = 4 super-Yang-Mills amplitude, we
explicitly construct a complete basis of diagram integrands that has only
logarithmic singularities and no poles at infinity. We then express the
complete amplitude in terms of the basis diagrams, with the coefficients
determined by unitarity. We also give examples at three loops showing how to
make the logarithmic singularity properties manifest via dlog forms. We give
additional evidence at four and five loops supporting the nonplanar logarithmic
singularity conjecture. Furthermore, we present a variety of examples
illustrating that these constraints are more restrictive than dual conformal
symmetry. Our investigations show that the singularity structures of planar and
nonplanar amplitudes in N = 4 super-Yang-Mills are strikingly similar. While it
is not clear how to extend either dual conformal symmetry or a dual formulation

supernova nucleosynthesis and on the neutrino signals. Our study is based on
detailed information about the neutrino spectra and their time evolution from a
spherically-symmetric supernova model for an 18 M progenitor. We find that
collective neutrino oscillations are not only sensitive to the detailed
neutrino energy and angular distributions at emission, but also to the time
evolution of both the neutrino spectra and the electron density profile. We
apply the results of neutrino oscillations to study the impact on supernova
nucleosynthesis and on the neutrino signals from a Galactic supernova. We show
that in our supernova model, collective neutrino oscillations enhance the
production of rare isotopes 138La and 180Ta but have little impact on the nu
p-process nucleosynthesis. In addition, the adiabatic MSW flavor
transformation, which occurs in the C/O and He shells of the supernova, may
affect the production of light nuclei such as 7Li and 11B. For the neutrino
signals, we calculate the rate of neutrino events in the Super-Kamiokande
detector and in a hypothetical liquid argon detector. Our results suggest the
possibility of using the time profiles of the events in both detectors, along
with the spectral information of the detected neutrinos, to infer the neutrino
mass hierarchy.

explaining all kinds of the Galactic cosmic ray spectra. However, high
precision measurement recently revealed the appreciable discrepancy between
data and model expectation, from spectrum observations of $\gamma$-rays,
$e^+/e^-$ and probably the $B/C$ ratio starting from $\sim$10 GeV energy. In
this work, we propose that the fresh cosmic rays, which are supplied by the
young accelerators and detained by local magnetic field, can contribute
additional secondary particles interacting with local materials. As this early
cosmic ray has a hard spectrum, the model calculation results in a
two-component $\gamma$-ray spectrum, which agree very well with the
observation. Simultaneously, the expected neutrino number from the galactic
plane could contribute $\sim60\%$ of IceCube observation neutrino number below
a few hundreds of TeV. The same pp-collision process can account for a
significant amount of the positron excesses. Under this model, it is expected
that the excesses in $\overline p/p$ and $B/C$ ratio will show up when energy
is above $\sim$10 GeV. We look forward that the model will be tested in the
near future by new observations from AMS02, IceCube, AS$\gamma$, HAWC and

primarily a function of the environment that they have resided in and so BTs
provide invaluable clues as to their local conditions. Thus, not only can
samples of BT galaxies be used as signposts of large-scale structure, but are
also valuable for obtaining a statistical measurement of properties of the
intra-cluster medium including the presence of cluster accretion shocks &
winds, and as historical anemometers, preserving the dynamical history of their
surroundings in their jets. We discuss the use of BTs to unveil large-scale
structure and provide an example in which a BT was used to unlock the dynamical
history of its host cluster. In addition to their use as density and dynamical
indicators, BTs are useful probes of the magnetic field on their environment on
scales which are inaccessible to other methods. Here we discuss a novel way in
which a particular sub-class of BTs, the so-called `corkscrew' galaxies might
further elucidate the coherence lengths of the magnetic fields in their
vicinity. Given that BTs are estimated to make up a large population in next

turbulence is below $l_A$, where $l_A$ is the injection scale of anisotropic
GS95-type turbulence, the linewidth difference does not depend on the magnetic
field strength. While for other turbulent regimes, the dependence is present.

the spherical model condensates in a non-equipartite way, while in the XY model
the transition becomes continuous and the O(2) symmetry remains unbroken, we
attribute this fact to the invariance under local gauge transformations. The
introduction of topological inhomogeneities in the network of quadruplets
induces novel features: again symmetry conservation; the vanishing of two-point
correlators; and a dynamical correlation function presenting two timescales,
the large one being related to the transition between different degenerated
configurations, connected by nonlocal gauge transformations. We discuss
possible experimental implications of these results in the context of nonlinear

matching (MCM) and the maximum weight matching (MWM) problems in the online

and the algorithm is required to always maintain a valid matching. On seeing an
edge, the algorithm has to either accept or reject the edge. If accepted, then
the adjacent edges are discarded. The complexity of the problem is settled for
deterministic algorithms.
  Almost nothing is known for randomized algorithms. A lower bound of $1.693$
is known for MCM with a trivial upper bound of $2$. An upper bound of $5.356$
is known for MWM. We initiate a systematic study of the same in this paper with
an aim to isolate and understand the difficulty. We begin with a primal-dual
analysis of the deterministic algorithm due to McGregor. All deterministic
lower bounds are on instances which are trees at every step. For this class of
(unweighted) graphs we present a randomized algorithm which is
$\frac{28}{15}$-competitive. The analysis is a considerable extension of the
(simple) primal-dual analysis for the deterministic case. The key new technique
is that the distribution of primal charge to dual variables depends on the
""neighborhood"" and needs to be done after having seen the entire input. The
assignment is asymmetric: in that edges may assign different charges to the two
end-points. Also the proof depends on a non-trivial structural statement on the
performance of the algorithm on the input tree.
  The other main result of this paper is an extension of the deterministic
lower bound of Varadaraja to a natural class of randomized algorithms which
decide whether to accept a new edge or not using independent random choices.

problem in underwater acoustic sensor networks (UASNs). The detection
information returned from a mobile node is meaningful only if its location is
known. In this paper, we propose two localization algorithms based on color
filtering technology called PCFL and ACFL. PCFL and ACFL aim at collaboratively
accomplishing accurate localization of underwater mobile nodes with minimum
energy expenditure. They both adopt the overlapping signal region of task
anchors which can communicate with the mobile node directly as the current
sampling area. PCFL employs the projected distances between each of the task
projections and the mobile node, while ACFL adopts the direct distance between
each of the task anchors and the mobile node. Also the proportion factor of
distance is proposed to weight the RGB values. By comparing the nearness
degrees of the RGB sequences between the samples and the mobile node, samples
can be filtered out. And the normalized nearness degrees are considered as the
weighted standards to calculate coordinates of the mobile nodes. The simulation
results show that the proposed methods have excellent localization performance
and can timely localize the mobile node. The average localization error of PCFL
can decline by about 30.4% than the AFLA method.

binaries a broad relativistically smeared iron line is observed. This feature
arises by fluorescence when the accretion disc is illuminated by hot corona
above it. Due to central location of the corona the illumination and thus also
the line emission decrease with radius. It was reported in the literature that
this decrease is very steep in some of the sources, suggesting a highly compact
corona.
  We revisit the lamp-post setup in which the corona is positioned on the axis
above the rotating black hole and investigate to what extent the steep
emissivity can be explained by this scenario. We show the contributions of the
relativistic effects to the disc illumination by the primary source - energy
shift, light bending and aberration. The lamp-post radial illumination pattern
is compared to the widely used radial broken power-law emissivity profile. We
find that very steep emissivities require the primary illuminating source to be
positioned very near the black hole horizon and/or the spectral power-law index
of the primary emission to be very high. The broken power-law approximation of
the illumination can be safely used when the primary source is located at
larger heights. However, for low heights the lamp-post illumination
considerably differs from this approximation.
  We also show the variations of the iron line local flux over the disc due to
the flux dependence on incident and emission angles. The former depends mainly
on the height of the primary source while the latter depends on the inclination
angle of the observer. Thus the strength of the line varies substantially
across the disc. This effect may contribute to the observed steeper emissivity.

that bursts are geometrically distributed and that they arrive according to a

evidence for complex burst arrival processes, highlighting the need for more
general stochastic models. To address this issue, we invoke a mapping between
general models of gene expression and systems studied in queueing theory to
derive exact analytical expressions for the moments associated with
mRNA/protein steady-state distributions. These moments are then used to derive
explicit conditions, based entirely on experimentally measurable quantities,

the black hole assumes axial symmetry, whereas the electromagnetic field may or

from test-field solution to exact solutions of coupled Einstein-Maxwell

The corner stone of our approach is the observation that heat engines are
particularly efficient when their operation involves a phase transition of
their working fluid. We derive and compute the thermoelastic coefficients of
various systems, including Bose and Fermi gases, and fluctuation Cooper pairs.
Combination of these coefficients yields the definition of the thermodynamic
figure of merit, the divergence of which at $finite$ temperature indicates that
conditions are fulfilled for the best possible use of the thermoelectric
working fluid. Here, this situation occurs in the fluctuation regime only, as a
consequence of the increased compressibility of the working fluid near its
phase transition. Our results and analysis clearly show that efforts in the

$\mathbf{Y}^d=\mathbf{Y}^{e\,T}$ at the GUT scale within the renormalizable
$R$-parity conserving Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM). Working in
the super-CKM basis, we consider non-zero flavour off-diagonal entries in the
soft SUSY-breaking mass matrices and the $A$-terms. At the same time, the
diagonal $A$-terms are assumed to be suppressed by the respective Yukawa
couplings. We show that a non-trivial flavour structure of the soft
SUSY-breaking sector can contribute to achieving precise Yukawa coupling
unification for all the three families. However, large non-zero values of the
flavour-violating parameter $(m^2_{dl})_{12}$ lead to a strong tension with the
Lepton Flavour Violating (LFV) observables. Nevertheless, the LFV problem does
not arise when the Yukawa coupling unification requirement is restricted to the
second and third families only. We demonstrate that such a scenario is
consistent with a wide set of experimental constraints, including flavour and
electroweak observables, Higgs physics and the LHC bounds. We also point out
that in order to provide a proper value for the relic density of dark matter,
the lightest neutralino needs to be almost purely bino-like and with mass in
the range of 200$\div$600 GeV. Such a clear experimental prediction makes the
flavour-violating $SU(5)$ Yukawa unification scenario fully testable at the LHC
14 TeV.

$(p_j)_{j\geq1}$ over positive integers. A random allocation consists of a
sample of $N$ independent drawings according to this probability distribution
where $N$ may be deterministic or Poisson-distributed. This paper is concerned
with occupancy counts, that is with the number of symbols with $r$ or at least
$r$ occurrences in the sample, and with the missing mass that is the total
probability of all symbols that do not occur in the sample. Without any further
assumption on the sampling distribution, these random quantities are shown to
satisfy Bernstein-type concentration inequalities. The variance factors in
these concentration inequalities are shown to be tight if the sampling
distribution satisfies a regular variation property. This regular variation
property reads as follows. Let the number of symbols with probability larger
than $x$ be $\vec{\nu}(x)=|\{j:p_j\geq x\}|$. In a regularly varying urn
scheme, $\vec{\nu}$ satisfies $\lim_{\tau \rightarrow0}\vec{\nu}(\tau
x)/\vec{\nu}(\tau)=x^{-\alpha}$ for $\alpha\in[0,1]$ and the variance of the
number of distinct symbols in a sample tends to infinity as the sample size
tends to infinity. Among other applications, these concentration inequalities
allow us to derive tight confidence intervals for the Good--Turing estimator of
the missing mass.

(RKBSs) which may be viewed as a generalization of reproducing kernel Hilbert
spaces (RKHSs). A key point is to endow Banach spaces with reproducing kernels
such that machine learning in RKBSs can be well-posed and of easy
implementation. First we verify many advanced properties of the general RKBSs
such as density, continuity, separability, implicit representation, imbedding,
compactness, representer theorem for learning methods, oracle inequality, and
universal approximation. Then, we develop a new concept of generalized Mercer
kernels to construct $p$-norm RKBSs for $1\leq p\leq\infty$. The $p$-norm RKBSs
preserve the same simple format as the Mercer representation of RKHSs.
Moreover, the $p$-norm RKBSs are isometrically equivalent to the standard
$p$-norm spaces of countable sequences. Hence, the $p$-norm RKBSs possess more
geometrical structures than RKHSs including sparsity. The generalized Mercer
kernels also cover many well-known kernels, for example, min kernels, Gaussian
kernels, and power series kernels. Finally, we propose to solve the support
vector machines in the $p$-norm RKBSs, which are to minimize the regularized
empirical risks over the $p$-norm RKBSs. We show that the infinite dimensional
support vector machines in the $p$-norm RKBSs can be equivalently transferred
to finite dimensional convex optimization problems such that we obtain the
finite dimensional representations of the support vector machine solutions for
practical applications. In particular, we verify that some special support
vector machines in the $1$-norm RKBSs are equivalent to the classical $1$-norm
sparse regressions. This gives fundamental supports of a novel learning tool
called sparse learning methods to be investigated in our next research project.

investigated. The key element of this model is the expression of apprehension
and judgement, basic cognitive process of decision making, as an inverse Bayes
inference classifying the information content of neuron spike trains. For
successive plural stimuli, it has been shown that this inference, equipped with
basic non-algorithmic jumps, is affected by quantum-like characteristics. We
show here that such a decision making process is related consistently with
ambiguous representation by an observer within a universe of discourse. In our
work ambiguous representation of an object or a stimuli is defined by a pair of
maps from objects of a set to their representations, where these two maps are
interrelated in a particular structure. The a priori and a posteriori
hypotheses in Bayes inference are replaced by the upper and lower
approximation, correspondingly, for the initial data sets each derived with
respect to a map. We show further that due to the particular structural
relation between the two maps, the logical structure of such combined
approximations can only be expressed as an orthomodular lattice and therefore
can be represented by a quantum rather than a Boolean logic. To our knowledge,
this is the first investigation aiming to reveal the concrete logic structure

resides at the centre of Abell 3135. Using Australia Telescope Compact Array
(ATCA) observations at 1.4, 2.5, 4.6 & 8.6 GHz, we performed a detailed
analysis of PKS J0334-3900. The morphology and spectral indices give physical
parameters that constrain the dynamical history of the galaxy, which we use to
produce a simulation of PKS J0334-3900. This simulation shows that the
morphology can be generated by a wind in the intracluster medium (ICM), orbital
motion caused by a companion galaxy, and precession of the black hole (BH).

newtonian theory in the description of the gravitational phenomena. In spite of
the remarkable success of the General Relativity Theory, the newtonian
gravitational theory is still largely employed, since General Relativity, in
most of the cases, just makes very small corrections to the newtonian
predictions. Moreover, the newtonian theory is much simpler, technically and
conceptually, when compared to the relativistic theory. In this text, we
discuss the possibility of extending the traditional newtonian theory in order
to incorporate typical relativistic effects, but keeping the simplicity of the
newtonian framework. We denominate these extensions neo-newtonian theories.
These theories are discussed mainly in the contexts of cosmology and compact
astrophysical objects.

measurable time, we propose a deformation of the Heisenberg algebra and show
that this leads to corrections to all quantum mechanical systems. We also
demonstrate that such a deformation implies a discrete spectrum for time. In
other words, time behaves like a crystal. As an application of our formalism,
we analyze the effect of such a deformation on the rate of spontaneous emission
in a hydrogen atom.

  analysis","47 pages, 4 figures, 2 tables, 35 references",,,,"physics.gen-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, we examine different generalized couple-stress continuum
mechanics theories, including couple stress, strain gradient and micropolar
theories. First, we investigate the fundamental requirements in any consistent
size-dependent couple stress continuum mechanics, for which satisfying basic
rules of mathematics and mechanics are crucial to establish a consistent
theory. As a result, we show that continuum couple stress theory must be based
on the displacement field and its corresponding macrorotation field as degrees
of freedom, while an extraneous artificial microrotation cannot be a true
continuum mechanical concept. Furthermore, the idea of generalized force and
independent generalized degrees of freedom show that the normal component of
the surface moment traction vector must vanish. Then, with these requirements
in mind, various existing couple stress theories are examined critically, and
we find that certain deviatoric curvature tensors create indeterminacy in the
spherical part of the couple stress tensor. We also examine micropolar and
micromorphic theories from this same perspective.

increased by placing turbid media at the input end of the MMF. This provides
the potential for high-resolution imaging through the MMF. While the input NA
is increased, the number of propagation modes in the MMF and hence the output
NA remains the same. This makes the image reconstruction process
underdetermined and may limit the quality of the image reconstruction. In this
paper, we aim to improve the signal to noise ratio (SNR) of the image
reconstruction in imaging through MMF. We notice that turbid media placed in
the input of the MMF transforms the incoming waves into a better format for
information transmission and information extraction. We call this
transformation as holistic random (HR) encoding of turbid media. By exploiting
the HR encoding, we make a considerable improvement on the SNR of the image
reconstruction. For efficient utilization of the HR encoding, we employ sparse
representation (SR), a relatively new signal reconstruction framework when it
is provided with a HR encoded signal. This study shows for the first time to
our knowledge the benefit of utilizing the HR encoding of turbid media for
recovery in the optically underdetermined systems where the output NA of it is
smaller than the input NA for imaging through MMF.
