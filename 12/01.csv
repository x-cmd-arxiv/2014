They
are produced by propagating periodic 2D diffraction patterns and can be
visualized as 3D stacks of Talbot carpets. The nonlinear Talbot effect
originates from 2D rogue waves and forms in a bulk 3D nonlinear medium. The
recurrences of an input rogue wave are observed at the Talbot length and at the
half-Talbot length, with a \pi phase shift; no other recurrences are observed.
Different from the nonlinear Talbot effect, the linear effect displays the
usual fractional Talbot images as well. We also find that the smaller the
period of incident rogue waves, the shorter the Talbot length. Increasing the
beam intensity increases the Talbot length, but above a threshold this leads to
a catastrophic self-focusing phenomenon which destroys the effect. We also find
that the Talbot recurrence can be viewed as a self-Fourier transform of the
initial periodic beam that is automatically performed during propagation. In
particular, linear Talbot effect can be viewed as a fractional self-Fourier
transform, whereas the nonlinear Talbot effect can be viewed as the regular
self-Fourier transform. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the rogue wave
initial condition is sufficient but not necessary for the observation of the
effect. It may also be observed from other periodic inputs, provided they are
set on a finite background. The 2D effect may find utility in the production of
3D photonic crystals.

present four common spectral peaks at about 103, 115, 130 and 150 yrs (this is
the frequency band that generates Maunder and Dalton like grand solar minima)
that can be deduced from a simple solar model based on a generic non-linear
coupling between planetary and solar harmonics; (2) time-frequency analysis and
advanced minimum variance distortion-less response (MVDR) magnitude squared
coherence analysis confirm the existence of persistent astronomical harmonics
in the climate records at the decadal and multidecadal scales when used with an
appropriate window length (110 years) to guarantee a sufficient spectral
resolution. However, the best coherence test can be currently made only by
comparing directly the temperature and astronomical spectra as done in Scafetta
(J. Atmos. Sol. Terr. Phys. 72(13), 951-970, 2010). The spectral coherence
between planetary, solar and climatic oscillations is confirmed at the
following periods: 5.2 yr, 5.93 yr, 6.62 yr, 7.42 yr, 9.1 yr (main lunar tidal
cycle), 10.4 yr (related to the 9.93-10.87-11.86 yr solar cycle harmonics),

kernel from a noisy blurry image. Recently, there has been a significant effort
on understanding the basic mechanisms to solve blind deconvolution. While this
effort resulted in the deployment of effective algorithms, the theoretical
findings generated contrasting views on why these approaches worked. On the one
hand, one could observe experimentally that alternating energy minimization
algorithms converge to the desired solution. On the other hand, it has been
shown that such alternating minimization algorithms should fail to converge and
one should instead use a so-called Variational Bayes approach. To clarify this
conundrum, recent work showed that a good image and blur prior is instead what
makes a blind deconvolution algorithm work. Unfortunately, this analysis did
not apply to algorithms based on total variation regularization. In this
manuscript, we provide both analysis and experiments to get a clearer picture
of blind deconvolution. Our analysis reveals the very reason why an algorithm
based on total variation works. We also introduce an implementation of this
algorithm and show that, in spite of its extreme simplicity, it is very robust
and achieves a performance comparable to the state of the art.

prove the validity of the linear Boltzmann equation on arbitrary large periods

located inside the coverage area of a macro base station according to Poisson

distances from those two. Under this model, upper and lower bounds on the

non-Euclidean geometry of Riemannian manifolds, usual Euclidean computer vision
and machine learning algorithms yield inferior results on such data. In this
paper, we define Gaussian radial basis function (RBF)-based positive definite
kernels on manifolds that permit us to embed a given manifold with a
corresponding metric in a high dimensional reproducing kernel Hilbert space.
These kernels make it possible to utilize algorithms developed for linear
spaces on nonlinear manifold-valued data. Since the Gaussian RBF defined with
any given metric is not always positive definite, we present a unified
framework for analyzing the positive definiteness of the Gaussian RBF on a
generic metric space. We then use the proposed framework to identify positive
definite kernels on two specific manifolds commonly encountered in computer
vision: the Riemannian manifold of symmetric positive definite matrices and the
Grassmann manifold, i.e., the Riemannian manifold of linear subspaces of a
Euclidean space. We show that many popular algorithms designed for Euclidean
spaces, such as support vector machines, discriminant analysis and principal
component analysis can be generalized to Riemannian manifolds with the help of
such positive definite Gaussian kernels.

proposes a simple adjustment that gives correct coverage in such situations:
replace the normal quantile with a critical value that depends only on the

entertained. We tabulate these critical values and quantify the loss in
coverage for conventional confidence intervals. For a range of relevant cases,
a conventional 95% confidence interval has coverage between 70% and 90%, and
our adjustment amounts to replacing the conventional critical value 1.96 with a

of them having a strictly ordered preference list over some or all of the other
agents. A matching is a set of disjoint pairs of mutually accepted agents. If
any two agents mutually prefer each other to their partner, then they block the
matching, otherwise, the matching is said to be stable. In this paper we
investigate the complexity of finding a solution satisfying additional
constraints on restricted pairs of agents. Restricted pairs can be either
forced or forbidden. A stable solution must contain all of the forced pairs,
while it must contain none of the forbidden pairs.
  Dias et al. gave a polynomial-time algorithm to decide whether such a
solution exists in the presence of restricted edges. If the answer is no, one
might look for a solution close to optimal. Since optimality in this context
means that the matching is stable and satisfies all constraints on restricted
pairs, there are two ways of relaxing the constraints by permitting a solution
to: (1) be blocked by some pairs (as few as possible), or (2) violate some
constraints on restricted pairs (again as few as possible).
  Our main theorems prove that for the (bipartite) stable marriage problem,
case (1) leads to NP-hardness and inapproximability results, whilst case (2)
can be solved in polynomial time. For the non-bipartite stable roommates
instances, case (2) yields an NP-hard problem. In the case of NP-hard problems,
we also discuss polynomially solvable special cases, arising from restrictions
on the lengths of the preference lists, or upper bounds on the numbers of
restricted pairs.

general G, and we describe the fundamental group of Y. Specializing to the case
G = GL(n,C), we explicitly compute the homotopy groups of the smooth locus of X
in a large range of dimensions, finding that they exhibit Bott Periodicity.
  As a further application of our methods (and in particular our general

observe significant strength of the $N(1675){5\over 2}^-$ in the $A_{1/2}$
amplitude, which is in strong disagreement with quark models that predict both
transverse amplitudes to be strongly suppressed. For the $N(1680){5\over 2}^+$
we observe a slow changeover from the dominance of the $A_{3/2}$ amplitude at
the real photon point ($Q^2=0$) to a $Q^2$ where $A_{1/2}$ begins to dominate.
The scalar amplitude $S_{1/2}$ drops rapidly with $Q^2$ consistent with quark
model prediction. For the $N(1710){1\over 2}^+$ resonance our analysis shows
significant strength for the $A_{1/2}$ amplitude at $Q^2 < 2.5$ GeV$^2$.

the classical fluctuations around these solutions, which form exceptional

established. This relation does not require the introduction of a time reversed

pseudo-synchronized with a zero obliquity. These two configurations would have
a different effect on the climate of this planet.

building block alternative to the common convolution-MP cascade of DCNNs; while
having identical complexity to MP, Epitomic Convolution allows for parameter
sharing across different filters, resulting in faster convergence and better
generalization. Second, we introduce a Multiple Instance Learning approach to
explicitly accommodate global translation and scaling when training a DCNN
exclusively with class labels. For this we rely on a `patchwork' data structure
that efficiently lays out all image scales and positions as candidates to a
DCNN. Factoring global and local deformations allows a DCNN to `focus its
resources' on the treatment of non-rigid deformations and yields a substantial
classification accuracy improvement. Third, further pursuing this idea, we
develop an efficient DCNN sliding window object detector that employs explicit

years as possible models of stable atoms in the field theories. One intriguing
example of such a nonradiating source is known as anapole (which means without
poles in Greek), and it was originally proposed by Yakov Zeldovich in nuclear
physics. Recently, an anapole was suggested as a model of elementary particles
describing dark matter in the Universe. Classically, an anapole mode can be
viewed as a composition of electric and toroidal dipole moments, resulting in
destructive interference of the radiation fields due to similarity of their
far-field scattering patterns. Here we demonstrate experimentally that
dielectric nanoparticles can exhibit a radiationless anapole mode in visible.
We achieve the spectral overlap of the toroidal and electric dipole modes
through a geometry tuning, and observe a highly pronounced dip in the far-field
scattering accompanied by the specific near-field distribution associated with
the anapole mode. The anapole physics provides a unique playground for the
study of electromagnetic properties of nontrivial excitations of complex
fields, reciprocity violation, and Aharonov-Bohm like phenomena at optical

the average distance traveled by the sensors to reach the final configuration

energy spent by the sensors during motion and faster convergence.

Among the terms contributing to the bulk viscosity, the term from the medium

pion softening. Contributions to the bulk viscosity arising from other
reactions induced by charged weak currents are included. The radiative bulk
viscosity induced by charged and neutral weak currents in the region of the

First, all existing over-symmetric approximations require a relational

often change the distribution significantly, making the computed probabilities
highly biased. We present a framework for probabilistic sampling-based

has gained high interest for many applications in transport, ecology, and
wearable computing. However, state-of-the-art compression methods involve high
space-time complexity or achieve unsatisfactory compression rate, leading to
rapid exhaustion of memory, computation, storage and energy resources. We
propose a novel online algorithm for error-bounded trajectory compression
called the Bounded Quadrant System (BQS), which compresses trajectories with
extremely small costs in space and time using convex-hulls. In this algorithm,
we build a virtual coordinate system centered at a start point, and establish a
rectangular bounding box as well as two bounding lines in each of its
quadrants. In each quadrant, the points to be assessed are bounded by the
convex-hull formed by the box and lines. Various compression error-bounds are
therefore derived to quickly draw compression decisions without expensive error
computations. In addition, we also propose a light version of the BQS version
that achieves $\mathcal{O}(1)$ complexity in both time and space for processing
each point to suit the most constrained computation environments. Furthermore,
we briefly demonstrate how this algorithm can be naturally extended to the 3-D
case.
  Using empirical GPS traces from flying foxes, cars and simulation, we
demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm in significantly reducing the
time and space complexity of trajectory compression, while greatly improving
the compression rates of the state-of-the-art algorithms (up to 47%). We then
show that with this algorithm, the operational time of the target
resource-constrained hardware platform can be prolonged by up to 41%.

constraints: vertices in $A$ are incident to at most one matching edge, while
vertices in $P$ are either unmatched or they are incident to a number of
matching edges between their lower and upper quota. This problem, which we call
maximum weight many-to-one matching with lower and upper quotas (WMLQ), has
applications to the assignment of students to projects within university
courses, where there are constraints on the minimum and maximum numbers of
students that must be assigned to each project.
  In this paper, we provide a comprehensive analysis of the complexity of WMLQ
from the viewpoints of classic polynomial time algorithms, fixed-parameter
tractability, as well as approximability. We draw the line between NP-hard and
polynomially tractable instances in terms of degree and quota constraints and
provide efficient algorithms to solve the tractable ones. We further show that
the problem can be solved in polynomial time for instances with bounded
treewidth; however, the corresponding runtime is exponential in the treewidth
with the maximum upper quota $u_{max}$ as basis, and we prove that this
dependence is necessary unless FPT = W[1]. The approximability of WMLQ is also
discussed: we present an approximation algorithm for the general case with
performance guarantee $u_{\max}+1$, which is asymptotically best possible
unless P = NP. Finally, we elaborate on how most of our positive results carry
over to matchings in arbitrary graphs with lower quotas.

with the multipartite symmetric quantum (MSQ) discord [Piani et al., Phys. Rev.

apply a recent and significant improvement of strong subadditivity of quantum
entropy [Fawzi and Renner, arXiv:1410.0664] in order to develop these

equal to zero if and only if the multipartite state for which it is evaluated
is approximately locally recoverable after performing measurements on each of
its systems. Furthermore, we prove that the CEMI is a faithful entanglement
measure, i.e., it vanishes if and only if the multipartite state for which it
is evaluated is a fully separable state. Along the way we provide an
operational interpretation of the MSQ discord in terms of the partial state
distribution protocol, which in turn, as a special case, gives an
interpretation for the original discord quantity. Finally, we prove an

system has been indispensable. From the quantization of the atom and field
within a superconducting cavity, a unique realm of EPR type entanglement has
emerged. In this way, dynamical evolution of the system in the strong coupling
regime is intimately tied with the coupling of an atom with a single resonant

of the strong coupling regime of Cavity Quantum Electrodynamics (QED) are

its roots in the interaction with the thermal excitation given by the Unruh

correspondingly propose a prediction in this study that the thermal radiation
appears in the inertial frame from an electron heated by the Unruh effect in
the accelerating frame. The point in our prediction is, although the Unruh
effect is only in the accelerating frame, if the appearance of the Brownian
motion rooted in the Unruh effect in the inertial frame can be predicted, the
heat that the particle gets in its body by the Unruh effect in the accelerating
frame could survive in the inertial frame. Based on such a prediction, in this
paper we investigate phenomena in the neighborhood of an accelerating electron
in the inertial frame. The model we consider is the four-dimensional
Klein-Gordon real scalar field model with the Higgs type potential term at the
finite temperature identified with the Unruh temperature on the de Sitter
space-time. We calculate the one-loop effective potential in the inertial frame
with the corrections by the thermal radiation rooted in the Unruh effect in the
accelerating frame. In this calculation, we take into account that the
background space-time is deformed due to the field theory's corrected one-loop
effective potential. Based on such an analysis, we illustrate the restoration
of the spontaneous symmetry breaking and the variation of the background
space-time, and we examine the accelerating particle's world-line and the
amount of the energy corresponding to the change of the acceleration.

radio sky; their progenitors and origins remain unknown and until now no rapid
multiwavelength follow-up of an FRB has been possible. New instrumentation has
decreased the time between observation and discovery from years to seconds, and
enables polarimetry to be performed on FRBs for the first time. We have
discovered an FRB (FRB 140514) in real-time on 14 May, 2014 at 17:14:11.06 UTC
at the Parkes radio telescope and triggered follow-up at other wavelengths
within hours of the event. FRB 140514 was found with a dispersion measure (DM)
of 562.7(6) cm$^{-3}$ pc, giving an upper limit on source redshift of $z
\lesssim 0.5$. FRB 140514 was found to be 21$\pm$7% (3-$\sigma$) circularly
polarized on the leading edge with a 1-$\sigma$ upper limit on linear
polarization $<10%$. We conclude that this polarization is intrinsic to the
FRB. If there was any intrinsic linear polarization, as might be expected from
coherent emission, then it may have been depolarized by Faraday rotation caused
by passing through strong magnetic fields and/or high density environments. FRB
140514 was discovered during a campaign to re-observe known FRB fields, and
lies close to a previous discovery, FRB 110220; based on the difference in DMs
of these bursts and time-on-sky arguments, we attribute the proximity to
sampling bias and conclude that they are distinct objects. Follow-up conducted
by 12 telescopes observing from X-ray to radio wavelengths was unable to
identify a variable multiwavelength counterpart, allowing us to rule out models
in which FRBs originate from nearby ($z < 0.3$) supernovae and long duration
gamma-ray bursts.

density of galaxies taking account of the contamination of their FIR emission.
We adopt a log-normal probability distribution for the ratio of $100\mu {\rm
m}$ and $r$-band luminosities of each galaxy, $y \equiv (\nu L)_{100\mu {\rm
m}}/(\nu L)_r$. Then we search for the mean and r.m.s values of $y$ that fit
the observed anomaly using the analytic model. The required values to reproduce
the anomaly are roughly consistent with those measured from the stacking
analysis of SDSS galaxies (Kashiwagi, Yahata, & Suto 2013). Due to the
limitation of our statistical modeling, we are not yet able to remove the FIR
contamination of galaxies from the extinction map. Nevertheless the agreement
with the model prediction suggests that the FIR emission of galaxies is mainly
responsible for the observed anomaly. While the corresponding systematic error
in the Galactic extinction map is 0.1 to 1mmag, it is directly correlated with
galaxy clustering, and thus needs to be carefully examined in precision
cosmology.

of compact convex subsets $K, K'$ of the Euclidean space intersect, and when
they are disjoint. The theorem is distinct from classical separation theorems.
It generalizes the {\it distance duality} proved in our earlier work for
testing the membership of a distinguished point in the convex hull of a finite
point set. Next by utilizing the theorem, we develop a substantially
generalized and stronger version of the {\it Triangle Algorithm} introduced in
the previous work to perform any of the following three tasks: (1) To compute a
pair $(p,p') \in K \times K'$, where either the Euclidean distance $d(p,p')$ is
to within a prescribed tolerance, or the orthogonal bisecting hyperplane of the
line segment $pp'$ separates the two sets; (2) When $K$ and $K'$ are disjoint,
to compute $(p,p') \in K \times K'$ so that $d(p,p')$ approximates $d(K,K')$ to
within a prescribed tolerance; (3) When $K$ and $K'$ are disjoint, to compute a
pair of parallel supporting hyperplanes $H,H'$ so that $d(H,H')$ is to within a
prescribed tolerance of the optimal margin. The worst-case complexity of each
iteration is solving a linear objective over $K$ or $K'$. The resulting
algorithm is a fully polynomial-time approximation scheme for such important
special cases as when $K$ and $K'$ are convex hulls of finite points sets, or
the intersection of a finite number of halfspaces. The results find many
theoretical and practical applications, such as in machine learning,
statistics, linear, quadratic and convex programming. In particular, in a
separate article we report on a comparison of the Triangle Algorithm and SMO
for solving the hard margin problem. In future work we extend the applications
to combinatorial and NP-complete problems.

encoded in neural populations? A vast body of work has explored how firing
rates in individual cells and correlations in the spikes of cell pairs impact
coding. But little is known about how higher-order correlations, which describe
simultaneous firing in triplets and larger ensembles of cells, impact encoded
stimulus information. Here, we take a first step toward closing this gap. We
vary triplet correlations in small (~10 cell) neural populations while keeping
single cell and pairwise statistics fixed at typically reported values. For
each value of triplet correlations, we estimate the performance of the neural
population on a two-stimulus discrimination task. We identify a predominant way
that such triplet correlations can strongly enhance coding: if triplet
correlations differ for the two stimuli, they skew the response distributions
of the two stimuli apart from each other, separating them and making them
easier to distinguish. This coding benefit does not occur when both stimuli
elicit similar triplet correlations. These results indicate that higher-order
correlations could have a strong effect on population coding. Finally, we
calculate how many samples are necessary to accurately measure spiking
correlations of this type, providing an estimate of the necessary recording
times in experiments.

Max.Stability-DG and MST-DG algorithms are based on a greedy strategy of
determining a data gathering tree when one is needed and using that tree as

tree at the current time instant. We observe the Max.Stability-DG trees to
incur a longer network lifetime (time of disconnection of the network of live
sensor nodes due to node failures), a larger coverage loss time for a
particular fraction of loss of coverage as well as a lower fraction of coverage
loss at any time. The tradeoff is that the Max.Stability-DG trees incur a lower

distribution. It has practically useful interpretation as the expected
remaining lifetime given survival up to a particular time point, and it also
characterizes the survival distribution. However, it has received limited
attention in terms of inference methods under a probabilistic modeling
framework. In this paper, we seek to provide general inference methodology for
mean residual life regression. Survival data often include a set of predictor
variables for the survival response distribution, and in many cases it is
natural to include the covariates as random variables into the modeling. We
thus propose a Dirichlet process mixture modeling approach for the joint
stochastic mechanism of the covariates and survival responses. This approach
implies a flexible model structure for the mean residual life of the
conditional response distribution, allowing general shapes for mean residual
life as a function of covariates given a specific time point, as well as a
function of time given particular values of the covariate vector. To expand the
scope of the modeling framework, we extend the mixture model to incorporate
dependence across experimental groups, such as treatment and control groups.
This extension is built from a dependent Dirichlet process prior for the
group-specific mixing distributions, with common locations and weights that
vary across groups through latent bivariate beta distributed random variables.
We develop properties of the proposed regression models, and discuss methods
for prior specification and posterior inference. The different components of
the methodology are illustrated with simulated data sets. Moreover, the
modeling approach is applied to a data set comprising right censored survival
times of patients with small cell lung cancer.

deviate from the SM predictions by a few percent due to extra Higgs boson loop
contributions. We find that if the deviations in the gauge couplings $hVV$
($V=Z, W$) are found with an enough large to be measured at the International
Linear Collider (ILC), the scale factors for the $hf\bar{f}$ couplings do not
overlap among the THDMs with four types of Yukawa interactions even taking into
account the radiative corrections. Therefore, in such a case, we can indirectly
determine the type of the THDMs at the ILC even without information from direct
searches of the additional Higgs bosons.

inner working angle (IWA) is to use a vector vortex coronagraph (VVC), which
provides a continuous helical phase ramp in the focal plane of the telescope
with a phase singularity in its center. Such an optical vortex is characterized
by its topological charge, i.e., the number of times the phase accumulates
2{\pi} radians along a closed path surrounding the singularity. Over the past
few years, we have been developing a charge-2 VVC induced by rotationally
symmetric subwavelength gratings (SGVC2), also known as the Annular Groove
Phase Mask (AGPM). Since 2013, several SGVC2s (or AGPMs) were manufactured
using synthetic diamond substrate, then validated on dedicated optical benches,
and installed on 10-m class telescopes. Increasing the topological charge seems
however mandatory for cancelling the light of bright stars which will be
partially resolved by future Extremely Large Telescopes in the near-infrared.
In this paper, we first detail our motivations for developing an SGVC4 (charge
4) dedicated to the near-infrared domain. The challenge lies in the design of
the pattern which is unrealistic in the theoretically perfect case, due to
state-of-the-art manufacturing limitations. Hence, we propose a new realistic
design of SGVC4 with minimized discontinuities and optimized phase ramp,
showing conclusive improvements over previous works in this field. A
preliminary validation of our concept is given based on RCWA simulations, while
full 3D finite-difference time-domain simulations (and eventually laboratory
tests) will be required for a final validation.

This technique constitutes an almost unique solution to the achromatization at

fabrication process of our AGPM imprinted on a diamond substrate. Diamond is an
ideal material for mid-infrared wavelengths owing to its high transparency,
small dispersion, extremely low thermal expansion and outstanding mechanical
and chemical properties. The design process has been performed with an
algorithm based on the rigorous coupled wave analysis (RCWA), and the
micro-fabrication has been carried out using nano-imprint lithography and

invariance of the Krylov subspace under a shift of the matrix. However,
exploiting this fact in the non-Hermitian case introduces restrictions; e.g.,
initial residuals must be collinear and this collinearity must be maintained at
restart. Thus we cannot simultaneously solve shifted systems with unrelated
right-hand sides using this strategy, and all shifted residuals cannot be
simultaneously minimized over a Krylov subspace such that collinearity is
maintained. It has been shown that this renders them generally incompatible
with techniques of subspace recycling [Soodhalter et al. APNUM '14].
  This problem, however, can be overcome. By interpreting a family of shifted
systems as one Sylvester equation, we can take advantage of the known ""shift
invariance"" of the Krylov subspace generated by the Sylvester operator. Thus we
can simultaneously solve all systems over one block Krylov subspace using FOM
or GMRES type methods, even when they have unrelated right-hand sides. Because
residual collinearity is no longer a requirement at restart, these methods are
fully compatible with subspace recycling techniques. Furthermore, we realize
the benefits of block sparse matrix operations which arise in the context of
high-performance computing applications.
  In this paper, we discuss exploiting this Sylvester equation point of view
which has yielded methods for shifted systems which are compatible with
unrelated right-hand sides. From this, we propose a recycled GMRES method for
simultaneous solution of shifted systems.Numerical experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of the methods.

longer wavelengths. The AGPM (Annular Groove Phase Mask, Mawet et al. 2005) is
an optical vectorial vortex coronagraph (or vector vortex) induced by a
rotationally symmetric subwavelength grating (i.e. with a period smaller than
{\lambda}/n, {\lambda} being the observed wavelength and n the refractive index
of the grating substrate). In this paper, we present our first mid- infrared
AGPM prototypes imprinted on a diamond substrate. We firstly give an
extrapolation of the expected coronagraph performances in the N-band (~10
{\mu}m), and prospects for down-scaling the technology to the most wanted L-
band (~3.5 {\mu}m). We then present the manufacturing and measurement results,
using diamond-optimized microfabrication techniques such as nano-imprint
lithography (NIL) and reactive ion etching (RIE). Finally, the subwavelength
grating profile metrology combines surface metrology (scanning electron
microscopy, atomic force microscopy, white light interferometry) with
diffractometry on an optical polarimetric bench and cross correlation with
theoretical simulations using rigorous coupled wave analysis (RCWA).

after single linearly polarized laser pulse excitation, the repeatability of

emission lines in its SDSS spectrum. We detect a single radio component at 1.6
GHz, but not at 5 GHz implying a spectral index steeper than $-1.5\pm0.5$
($S_\nu\propto\nu^\alpha$). The high brightness temperature of the radio
component ($\sim1.4\times10^7$ K) and the steep radio spectrum support a
non-thermal synchrotron origin. A crude estimate of the black hole mass derived
from the $M_{BH}-\sigma_{\star}$ relation is $\sim1.4\pm1.0\times10^8$ Msun; it
is accreting at an Eddington rate of $\sim0.02$. The radio data are consistent
with either the radio emission coming from the parsec-scale base of a
synchrotron wind originating in the magnetised corona above the accretion disk,
or from the inner ionised edge of the accretion disk or torus. In the former
case, the narrow line region (NLR) clouds may form a part of the broad outflow,
while in the latter, the NLR clouds may form a part of an extended disk beyond
the torus. The radio and NLR emission may also be decoupled so that the radio
emission originates in an outflow while the NLR is in a disk, and vice versa.
While with the present data, it is not possible to clearly distinguish between
these scenarios, there appears to be greater circumstantial evidence supporting
the coronal wind picture in KISSR1494. From the kiloparsec-scale radio
emission, the time-averaged kinetic power of this outflow is estimated to be
$Q\approx1.5\times10^{42}$ erg s$^{-1}$, which is typical of radio outflows in
low-luminosity AGN. This supports the idea that radio ""jets"" and outflowing
coronal winds are indistinguishable in Seyfert galaxies.

temporal sequence of pulses. The nature of this stochastic process carries
information on how GRB inner engines work. The so-called interpulse time
defines the interval between adjacent pulses, excluding the long quiescence
periods during which the signal drops to the background level. It was found by
many authors in the past that interpulse times are lognormally distributed, at
variance with the exponential case that is expected for a memoryless process.
We investigated whether the simple hypothesis of a temporally uncorrelated
sequence of pulses is really to be rejected, as a lognormal distribution
necessarily implies. We selected and analysed a number of multi--peaked
CGRO/BATSE GRBs and simulated similar time profiles, with the crucial
difference that we assumed exponentially distributed interpulse times, as is
expected for a memoryless stationary Poisson process. We then identified peaks
in both data sets using a novel peak search algorithm, which is more efficient
than others used in the past. We independently confirmed that the observed
interpulse time distribution is approximately lognormal. However, we found the
same results on the simulated profiles, in spite of the intrinsic exponential
distribution. Although intrinsic lognormality cannot be ruled out, this shows
that intrinsic interpulse time distribution in real data could still be
exponential, while the observed lognormal could be ascribed to the low
efficiency of peak search algorithms at short values combined with the
limitations of a bin-integrated profile. Our result suggests that GRB engines
may emit pulses after the fashion of nuclear radioactive decay, that is, as a
memoryless process.

Orion Bar PDR. We used the IRAM-30m telescope to carry out a millimetre line
survey towards the Orion Bar edge, complemented with ~2'x2' maps of the C2H and
c-C3H2 emission. We analyse the excitation of the detected hydrocarbons and
constrain the physical conditions of the emitting regions with non-LTE
radiative transfer models. We compare the inferred column densities with
updated gas-phase photochemical models including 13CCH and C13CH isotopomer
fractionation. ~40% of the lines in the survey arise from hydrocarbons (C2H,
C4H, c-C3H2, c-C3H, C13CH, 13CCH, l-C3H and l-H2C3). We detect new lines from
l-C3H+ and improve its rotational spectroscopic constants. Anions or deuterated
hydrocarbons are not detected: [C2D]/[C2H]<0.2%, [C2H-]/[C2H]<0.007% and
[C4H-]/[C4H]<0.05%. Our gas-phase models can reasonably match the observed
column densities of most hydrocarbons (within factors <3). Since the observed
spatial distribution of the C2H and c-C3H2 emission is similar but does not
follow the PAH emission, we conclude that, in high UV-flux PDRs,
photodestruction of PAHs is not a necessary requirement to explain the observed
abundances of the smallest hydrocarbons. Instead, gas-phase endothermic
reactions (or with barriers) between C+, radicals and H2 enhance the formation
of simple hydrocarbons. Observations and models suggest that the [C2H]/[c-C3H2]
ratio (~32 at the PDR edge) decreases with the UV field attenuation. The
observed low cyclic-to-linear C3H column density ratio (<3) is consistent with
a high electron abundance (Xe) PDR environment. In fact, the poorly constrained
Xe gradient influences much of the hydrocarbon chemistry in the more
UV-shielded gas. We propose that reactions of C2H isotopologues with 13C+ and H
atoms can explain the observed [C13CH]/[13CCH]=1.4(0.1) fractionation level.

(AFM/COI)-ferromagnetic metal (FMM) phase transition, coupled with the colossal
hysteresis between the field cool cooled and field cooled warming magnetization
demonstrates strongly phase separated nature, which gives rise to
non-equilibrium magnetic liquid state that freezes into a magnetic glass. The
thermal cycling and magnetic field dependence of the resistivity unambiguously
shows that the pronounced resistivity minimum observed during warming is a
consequence non-equilibrium states resulting from the magnetic frustration
created by the delicate coexistence of the FMM and AFM/COI phases. The
non-equilibrium states and hence the resistivity minimum is extremely sensitive
to the relative fraction of the coexisting phases and can be tuned by intrinsic
and extrinsic perturbations like the defect density, thermal cycling and
magnetic field.

unique opportunity to directly test our quantitative model of grain alignment
based on radiative torques (RATs) and to explore new effects arising from
additional torques. In this paper, we first perform detailed modeling of grain
alignment by RATs for the IC 63 reflection nebula illuminated both by a nearby
$\gamma$ Cas star and the diffuse interstellar radiation field. We calculate
linear polarization $p_{\lambda}$ of background stars by radiatively aligned
grains and explore the variation of fractional polarization ($p_{\lambda}/A_V$)
with visual extinction $A_{V}$ across the cloud. Our results show that the
variation of $p_{V}/A_{V}$ versus $A_{V}$ from the dayside of IC 63 to its
center can be represented by a power-law ($p_{V}/A_{V}\propto A_{V}^{\eta}$)
with different slopes depending on $A_{V}$. We find a shallow slope $\eta \sim-
0.1$ for $A_{V}< 3$ and a very steep slope $\eta\sim -2$ for $A_{V}> 4$. We
then consider the effects of additional torques due to H$_{2}$ formation and
model grain alignment by joint action of RATs and H$_2$ torques. We find that
$p_{V}/A_{V}$ tends to increase with an increasing magnitude of H$_{2}$
torques. In particular, the theoretical predictions obtained for $p_{V}/A_{V}$
and peak wavelength $\lambda_{\max}$ in this case show an improved agreement
with the observational data. Our results reinforce the predictive power of the
RAT alignment mechanism in a broad range of environmental conditions and show
the effect of pinwheel torques in environments with efficient H$_2$ formation.
Physical parameters involved in H$_2$ formation may be constrained using
detailed modeling of grain alignment combined with observational data. In
addition, we discuss implications of our modeling for interpreting latest
observational data by {\it Planck} and other ground-based instruments.

constrain the formation of binary stars, it is important to know the binary
mass-ratio distribution. However, in most cases, i.e. for single-lined
spectroscopic binaries, the mass ratio cannot be measured directly but only
derived as the convolution of a function that depends on the mass ratio and the
unknown inclination angle of the orbit on the plane of the sky. We extend our
previous method to deconvolve this inverse problem (Cure et al. 2014), i.e., we
obtain as an integral the cumulative distribution function (CDF) for the mass
ratio distribution. After a suitable transformation of variables it turns out
that this problem is the same as the one for rotational velocities $v \sin i$,
allowing a close analytic formulation for the CDF. We then apply our method to
two real datasets: a sample of Am stars binary systems, and a sample of massive
spectroscopic binaries in the Cyg OB2 Association.} {We are able to reproduce
the previous results of Boffin (2010) for the sample of Am stars, while we show
that the mass ratio distribution of massive stars shows an excess of small mass
ratio systems, contrarily to what was claimed by Kobulnicky et al. (2014). Our
method proves very robust and deconvolves the distribution from a sample in
just a single step.

research domains as such significant research interests are motivated by a
number of real world applications such as video surveillance, sports analysis,
healthcare monitoring and so on. However, most of these real world applications
face high levels of uncertainties that can affect the operations of such
applications. Hence, the fuzzy set theory has been applied and showed great
success in the recent past. In this paper, we aim at reviewing the fuzzy set
oriented approaches for HMA, individuating how the fuzzy set may improve the
HMA, envisaging and delineating the future perspectives. To the best of our
knowledge, there is not found a single survey in the current literature that
has discussed and reviewed fuzzy approaches towards the HMA. For ease of
understanding, we conceptually classify the human motion into three broad
levels: Low-Level (LoL), Mid-Level (MiL), and High-Level (HiL) HMA.

linear relationship between the actual space gap and speed can be identified
when the speed difference between vehicles approximates zero; (2) vehicles

itinerant electrons at the sublattice $A$ site and spin-$s$ localized electrons
at the sublattice $B$ site is considered. The exchange between itinerant and
localized electrons is antiferromanetic. As a result the external magnetic
field, applied along the magnetization of the localized electrons, compensates
the Zeeman splitting due to the spin-fermion exchange and magnon-fermion
interaction induces spin anti-parallel p-wave superconductivity which coexists
with magnetism. We have obtained five characteristic values of the applied
field (in units of energy) $H_{cr1}<H_3<H_0<H_4<H_{cr2}$. At $H_0$ the external
magnetic field compensates the Zeeman splitting. When $H_{cr1}<H<H_{cr2}$ the
spin antiparallel p-wave superconductivity with $T_{1u}$ configuration coexists
with magnetism. The superconductor to normal magnet transition at finite
temperature is second order when $H$ runs the interval $(H_3,H_4)$. It is an
abrupt transition when $H_{cr1}<H<H_3$ or $H_4<H<H_{cr2}$. This is proved
calculating the temperature dependence of the gap for three different values of
the external magnetic field $H_{cr1}<H<H_3$, $H_4<H<H_{cr2}$ and $H=H_0$. In
the first two cases the abrupt fall to zero of the gap at superconducting
critical temperature shows that the superconductor to normal magnet transition
is first order. The Hubbard term (Coulomb repulsion), in a weak coupling
regime, does not affect significantly the magnon induced superconductivity.
Relying on the above results one can formulate a recipe for preparing a
superconductor from ferrimagnetic spinel: i) hydrostatic pressure above the
critical value of insulator-metal transition. ii) external magnetic field along
the sublattice magnetization with higher amplitude.

estimate various candidates for the carrier period for the CF method. Secondly,
a global fit to the whole data set and local fits to shorter segments are
computed with the period that is found to be the optimal one. The harmonic
least-squares analysis of all the available data reveals a short period close
to 1.6 days as a limiting value for a set of significant frequencies. We
interpret this as the rotation period of the spots near the equatorial region.
In addition, the distribution of the significant periods is found to be
bimodal, hinting of a longer-term modulating period, which we set out to study
with a two-harmonic CF model. Weak modulation signal is, indeed retrieved, with
a period of roughly 6.9 years. The phase dispersion analysis gives a clear
symmetric minimum for coherence times lower than and around 100 days. We
interpret this as the mean rotation period of the spots (1.60514 days), and
this value is chosen to be used as the carrier period for the CF analysis. With
the CF method we seek for any systematic trends in the spot distribution in the
global time frame, and locally look for abrupt phase changes earlier reported
in rapidly rotating objects. During 2005-2008 the global CF reveals a coherent
structure rotating with a period of 1.6037 days, while during most other times
the spot distribution appears rather random in phase. The evolution of the spot
distribution of the object is found to be very chaotic, with no clear signs of
an azimuthal dynamo wave that would persist over longer time scales, although
the short-lived coherent structures observed occasionally do not rotate with

cuprates: 133 K at ambient pressure and 164 K at high pressures. As the nature
of superconductivity in these materials is still not disclosed, the prospects
for a higher Tc are not clear. In contrast the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS)
theory gives a clear guide for achieving high Tc: it should be a favorable
combination of high frequency phonons, strong coupling between electrons and
phonons, and high density of states. These conditions can be fulfilled for
metallic hydrogen and covalent hydrogen dominant compounds. Numerous followed
calculations supported this idea and predicted Tc=100-235 K for many hydrides
but only moderate Tc~17 K has been observed experimentally. Here we found that
sulfur hydride transforms at P~90 GPa to metal and superconductor with Tc
increasing with pressure to 150 K at ~200 GPa. This is in general agreement
with recent calculations of Tc~80 K for H2S. Moreover we found
superconductivity with Tc~190 K in a H2S sample pressurized to P>150 GPa at
T>220 K. This superconductivity likely associates with the dissociation of H2S,
and formation of SHn (n>2) hydrides. We proved occurrence of superconductivity
by the drop of the resistivity at least 50 times lower than the copper
resistivity, the decrease of Tc with magnetic field, and the strong isotope
shift of Tc in D2S which evidences a major role of phonons in the
superconductivity. H2S is a substance with a moderate content of hydrogen
therefore high Tc can be expected in a wide range of hydrogen-contain
materials. Hydrogen atoms seem to be essential to provide the high frequency
modes in the phonon spectrum and the strong electron-phonon coupling.

tools for this purpose. However, recovering the correct frequencies and
assessing the probability of each frequency is not straightforward.
  Aims. We provide a formalism that is easy to implement in a code, to describe
a Bayesian periodogram that includes weights and a constant offset in the data.
The relative probability between peaks can be easily calculated with this
formalism. We discuss the differences and agreements between the various
periodogram formalisms with simulated examples.
  Methods. We used the Bayesian probability theory to describe the probability
that a full sine function (including weights derived from the errors on the
data values and a constant offset) with a specific frequency is present in the
data.
  Results. From the expression for our Baysian generalised Lomb-Scargle
periodogram (BGLS), we can easily recover the expression for the non-Bayesian
version. In the simulated examples we show that this new formalism recovers the
underlying periods better than previous versions. A Python-based code is

which have properties similar to Zamolodchikov's $C$-function, and are
geometrically natural objects related to the theory space explored by
non-perturbative functional renormalization group (RG) equations. Employing the
Euclidean framework of the Effective Average Action (EAA), we propose a
$C$-function which can be defined for arbitrary systems of gravitational,
Yang-Mills, ghost, and bosonic matter fields, and in any number of spacetime
dimensions. It becomes stationary both at critical points and in classical
regimes, and decreases monotonically along RG trajectories provided the
breaking of the split-symmetry which relates background and quantum fields is
sufficiently weak. Within the Asymptotic Safety approach we test the proposal
for Quantum Einstein Gravity in $d>2$ dimensions, performing detailed numerical
investigations in $d=4$. We find that the bi-metric Einstein-Hilbert truncation
of theory space introduced recently is general enough to yield perfect
monotonicity along the RG trajectories, while its more familiar single-metric
analog fails to achieve this behavior which we expect on general grounds.
Investigating generalized crossover trajectories connecting a fixed point in
the ultraviolet to a classical regime with positive cosmological constant in
the infrared, the $C$-function is shown to depend on the choice of the
gravitational instanton which constitutes the background spacetime. For de
Sitter space in 4 dimensions, the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy is found to play a
role analogous to the central charge in conformal field theory. We also comment
on the idea of a `$\Lambda$-$N$ connection' and the `$N$-bound' discussed
earlier.

capabilities of the VEGAS-SSS. Leveraging the large field of view of the VST
allow us to accurately study of the distribution and properties of SSSs as a
function of galactocentric distance Rgc, well beyond ~20 galaxy effective
radii, in a way not often possible. Our analysis of colors, magnitudes and
sizes of SSS candidates confirms the results from existing studies, some of
which carried out with 8-10m class telescopes, and further extends them to
unreached Rgc distances, with similar accuracy. We find a color bimodality for
the GC population and a r1/4 profile for the surface density of GCs as for the
galaxy light profile. The radial color gradient of blue and red GCs previously
found, for instance by the SLUGGS survey, is further extended out to the
largest Rgc inspected, ~65 kpc. The surface density profiles of blue and red
GCs taken separately are well approximated by a r1/4 density profile, with the
fraction of blue GCs being slightly larger at larger Rgc. We do not find hints
of a trend for the red GC and for the GC turnover magnitude to vary with
radius, but we observe a ~0.2 mag difference in the turnover magnitude of the
blue and red GCs subpopulations. Inspecting SSS sizes and colors we obtained a
list of UCDs and GC candidates suitable for future spectroscopic follow-up. In
conclusion, our study shows the reliability of the methodologies developed to

show CI is preferentially detected in gas with low temperatures (below 20 K),
which possibly explains the comparable H2 column density calculated from both
tracers (both CI and 12CO underestimate column density), as a significant
amount of the CI in the warmer gas is likely in the higher energy state

investigated for the spectral distribution for attachment and removal of a
nucleon, spectroscopic factors and matter radii. We employ self-consistent
Green's function (SCGF) theory which allows a comprehensive calculation of the
single particle spectral function. For the closed subshell isotopes, $^{14}$O,
$^{16}$O, $^{22}$O, $^{24}$O and $^{28}$O, we perform calculations with the
Dyson-ADC(3) method. The remaining open shell isotopes are studied using the
newly developed Gorkov-SCGF formalism up to second order. We produce plots for
the full-fledged spectral distributions. The spectroscopic factors for the
dominant quasiparticle peaks are found to depend very little on the leading
order (NNLO) chiral 3NFs. The latters have small impact on the calculated
matter radii, which, however are consistently obtained smaller than experiment.
Similarly, single particle spectra tend to be diluted with respect to
experiment. This effect might hinder, to some extent, the onset of correlations
and screen the quenching of calculated spectroscopic factors. The most
important effects of 3NFs is thus the fine tuning of the energies for the
dominant quasiparticle states, which govern the shell evolution and the
position of driplines. Although present chiral NNLO 3NFs interactions do
reproduce the binding energies correctly in this mass region, the details of
the nuclear wave function remain at odd with the experiment showing too small
radii and a too dilute single particle spectrum, similar to what already
pointed out for larger masses. This suggests a lack of repulsion in the present
model of NN+3N interactions which is mildly apparent already for masses in the

fewer fused benzene rings, thus containing 1550 PAHs and 805 fully
dehydrogenated aromatics. A large fraction of the species in our database have
clearly non-planar or curved geometries. For each species, we determined the
frequencies and intensities of their normal modes using density functional
theory calculations. Whereas most PAH spectra are fairly similar, the spectra
of fully dehydrogenated aromatics are much more diverse. Nevertheless, these
fully dehydrogenated species show characteristic emission features at
5.2$\mu$m, 5.5$\mu$m and 10.6$\mu$m; at longer wavelengths, there is a forest
of emission features in the 16--30$\mu$m range that appears as a structured
continuum, but with a clear peak centered around 19$\mu$m. We searched for
these features in Spitzer-IRS spectra of various positions in the reflection
nebula NGC 7023. We find a weak emission feature at 10.68$\mu$m in all
positions except that closest to the central star. We also find evidence for a
weak 19$\mu$m feature at all positions that is not likely due to C$_{60}$. We
interpret these features as tentative evidence for the presence of a small
population of fully dehydrogenated PAHs, and discuss our results in the

(cryo-EM), the 3D structure of a molecule needs to be determined from its 2D
projection images taken at unknown viewing directions. Zvi Kam showed already
in 1980 that the autocorrelation function of the 3D molecule over the rotation
group SO(3) can be estimated from 2D projection images whose viewing directions
are uniformly distributed over the sphere. The autocorrelation function
determines the expansion coefficients of the 3D molecule in spherical harmonics
up to an orthogonal matrix of size $(2l+1)\times (2l+1)$ for each
$l=0,1,2,...$. In this paper we show how techniques for solving the phase
retrieval problem in X-ray crystallography can be modified for the cryo-EM
setup for retrieving the missing orthogonal matrices. Specifically, we present
two new approaches that we term Orthogonal Extension and Orthogonal
Replacement, in which the main algorithmic components are the singular value
decomposition and semidefinite programming. We demonstrate the utility of these
approaches through numerical experiments on simulated data.

and Hall effect investigations on high quality single crystals at temperatures
1.9-120 K and in magnetic field up to 80 kOe. The undertaken analysis of
$\Delta\rho/\rho$ allows us to conclude that the large negative
magnetoresistance (nMR) observed in vicinity of Neel temperature is caused by
scattering of charge carriers on magnetic clusters of Ho$^{3+}$ ions, and that
these nanosize regions with AF exchange inside may be considered as short range
order AF domains. It was shown that the Yosida relation $-\Delta
\rho/\rho$$\sim$$M^2$ provides an adequate description of the nMR effect for
the case of Langevin type behavior of magnetization. Moreover, a reduction of
Ho-ion effective magnetic moments in the range 3-9$\mu_B$ was found to develop
both with temperature lowering and under the increase of holmium content. A
phenomenological description of the large positive quadratic contribution
$\Delta \rho/\rho$$\sim$$\mu_D^2 H^2$ which dominates in

to estimate the drift mobility exponential changes $\mu_D$$\sim$$T^{-a}$ with
$a$=1.3-1.6 depending on Ho concentration. An even more comprehensive behavior
of magnetoresistance has been found in the AF state of Ho$_x$Lu$_{1-x}$B$_{12}$

charge carriers scattering on the spin density wave (SDW). High precision

sensing techniques to delineate the extent of mangroves and aquaculture at
approximately decadal periods since the arrival of aquaculture in each
Ecuadorian estuary. We then spatiotemporally calculate the carbon values of the
mangrove forests and estimate the amount of carbon lost due to direct
displacement by aquaculture. Additionally, we calculate the new carbon stocks
generated due to mangrove reforestation or afforestation. This research
introduces time and land use / land cover change (LUCC) into the tropical
forest carbon literature and examines forest carbon loss at a higher
spatiotemporal resolution than in many earlier analyses. We find that 80%, or
7,014,517 t of the living carbon lost in Ecuadorian mangrove forests can be
attributed to direct displacement of mangrove forests by shrimp aquaculture. We
also find that Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) compliant
carbon grids within Ecuador's estuaries overestimate living carbon levels in
estuaries where substantial LUCC has occurred. By approaching the mangrove
forest carbon loss question from a LUCC perspective, these findings allow for
tropical nations and other intervention agents to prioritize and target a
limited set of land transitions that likely drive the majority of carbon
losses. This singular cause of transition has implications for programs that
attempt to offset or limit future forest carbon losses and place value on

  Petroleum Industry","21st World Petroleum Congress",,,,"cs.CY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  ""Big Data is the oil of the new economy"" is the most famous citation during
the three last years. It has even been adopted by the World Economic Forum in
2011. In fact, Big Data is like crude! It's valuable, but if unrefined it
cannot be used. It must be broken down, analyzed for it to have value. But what
about Big Data generated by the Petroleum Industry and particularly its
upstream segment?
  Upstream is no stranger to Big Data. Understanding and leveraging data in the
upstream segment enables firms to remain competitive throughout planning,
exploration, delineation, and field development. Oil & Gas Companies conduct
advanced geophysics modeling and simulation to support operations where 2D, 3D
& 4D Seismic generate significant data during exploration phases. They closely
monitor the performance of their operational assets. To do this, they use
thousands sensors in subsurface wells and surface facilities to provide
continuous and real-time monitoring of assets and environmental conditions.
Unfortunately, this information comes in various and increasingly complex
forms, making it a challenge to collect, interpret, and leverage the disparate
data.
  Big Data technologies integrate common and disparate data sets to deliver the
right information at the appropriate time to the correct decision-maker. These
capabilities help firms act on large volumes of data, transforming
decision-making from reactive to proactive and optimizing all phases of
exploration, development and production. Furthermore, Big Data offers multiple
opportunities to ensure safer, more responsible operations. Another invaluable
effect of that would be shared learning.
  The aim of this paper is to explain how to use Big Data technologies to
optimize operations. How can Big Data help experts to decision-making leading
the desired outcomes?

characterization of exoplanet atmospheres. Between today and 2025, the field
will evolve at an even faster pace with the advent of several space-based
transit search missions, ground-based spectrographs, high-contrast imaging
facilities, and the James Webb Space Telescope. Especially the ESA M-class
PLATO mission will be a game changer in the field. From 2024 onwards, PLATO
will find transiting terrestrial planets orbiting within the habitable zones of
nearby, bright stars. These objects will require the power of Extremely Large
Telescopes (ELTs) to be characterized further. The technique of ground-based
high-resolution spectroscopy is establishing itself as a crucial pathway to
measure chemical composition, atmospheric structure and atmospheric circulation
in transiting exoplanets. A high-resolution spectrograph covering the visible
and near-IR domains, mounted on the European ELT, will be able to detect
molecules such as water vapour, carbon dioxide and oxygen in the atmospheres of
habitable planets under favourable circumstances. E-ELT HiRES is the perfect
ground-based match to the PLATO space mission and represents a unique
opportunity for Europe to lead the world into the era of exploration of
exoplanets with habitable conditions. HiRES will also be extremely
