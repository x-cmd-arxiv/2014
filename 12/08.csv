asymptotically $AdS_3$ background. The generalized minimal massive gravity
theory is realized by adding the CS deformation term, the higher derivative
deformation term, and an extra term to pure Einstein gravity with a negative
cosmological constant. We study the linearized excitations around the $AdS_3$
background and find that at special point (tricritical) in parameter space the
two massive graviton solutions become massless and they are replaced by two
solutions with logarithmic and logarithmic-squared boundary behavior. So it is
natural to proposed that GMMG model could also provide a holographic
description for a $3-$rank Logarithmic Conformal Field Theory (LCFT). We
calculate the energy of the linearized gravitons in $AdS_3$ background, and
show that the theory is free of negative-energy bulk modes. Then we obtain the
central charges of the CFT dual explicitly and show GMMG also avoids the
aforementioned ""bulk-boundary unitarity clash"". After that we show that General
Zwei-Dreibein Gravity (GZDG) model can reduce to GMMG model. Finally by a
Hamiltonian analysis we show that the GMMG model has no Boulware-Deser ghosts
and this model propagate only two physical modes.

simplification of big data via measuring the life time of intrinsic topological
features in a filtration process and has found its success in scientific and
engineering applications. However, such a success is essentially limited to
qualitative data characterization, identification and analysis (CIA). In this
work, we outline a general protocol to construct objective-oriented persistent
homology methods. The minimization of the objective functional leads to a
Laplace-Beltrami operator which generates a multiscale representation of the
initial data and offers an objective oriented filtration process. The resulting
differential geometry based objective-oriented persistent homology is able to
preserve desirable geometric features in the evolutionary filtration and
enhances the corresponding topological persistence. The consistence between
Laplace-Beltrami flow based filtration and Euclidean distance based filtration
is confirmed on the Vietoris-Rips complex for a large amount of numerical
tests. The convergence and reliability of the present Laplace-Beltrami flow
based cubical complex filtration approach are analyzed over various spatial and

verified by more than 500 fullerene molecules. It is shown that the proposed
persistent homology based quantitative model offers good predictions of total
curvature energies for ten types of fullerene isomers. The present work offers
the first example to design objective-oriented persistent homology to enhance

quantitative models to correlate local and global Betti-2 bars respectively
with the heat of formation and total curvature energies of fullerenes. It is
found that the heat of formation energy is related to the local hexagonal
cavities of small fullerenes, while the total curvature energies of fullerene
isomers are associated with their sphericities, which are measured by the
lengths of their long-lived Betti-2 bars. Excellent correlation coefficients

fingerprint or topological signature of noise, which is widespread in cryo-EM
data. For low signal to noise ratio (SNR) volumetric data, intrinsic
topological features of biomolecular structures are indistinguishable from
noise. To remove noise, we employ geometric flows which are found to preserve
the intrinsic topological fingerprints of cryo-EM structures and diminish the
topological signature of noise. In particular, persistent homology enables us
to visualize the gradual separation of the topological fingerprints of cryo-EM
structures from those of noise during the denoising process, which gives rise
to a practical procedure for prescribing a noise threshold to extract cryo-EM
structure information from noise contaminated data after certain iterations of
the geometric flow equation. To further demonstrate the utility of persistent
homology for cryo-EM data analysis, we consider a microtubule intermediate
structure (EMD-1129). Three helix models, an alpha-tubulin monomer model, an
alpha- and beta-tubulin model, and an alpha- and beta-tubulin dimer model, are
constructed to fit the cryo-EM data. The least square fitting leads to
similarly high correlation coefficients, which indicates that structure
determination via optimization is an ill-posed inverse problem. By a comparison
of the topological fingerprints of the original data and those of three models,
we found that the third model is topologically favored. The present work offers
persistent homology based new strategies for topological denoising and for

determination problems of whether a graph contains a HIST or whether a graph
contains a spanning Halin graph are shown to be NP-complete. It was conjectured

And it was conjectured by Lov\'asz and Plummer that {\it every 4-connected

the above two facts, in this paper, we consider generalized Halin graphs, a
family of graph structures which are ""stronger"" than HISTs but ""weaker"" than
Halin graphs in the sense of their construction constraints. To be exact, a
generalized Halin graph is formed from a HIST by connecting its leaves into a

the minimum degree condition for a graph to contain it as a spanning subgraph.
We show that there exists a positive integer $n_0$ such that any 3-connected

a spanning generalized Halin graph. As an application, the result implies that
under the same condition, the graph $G$ contains a wheel-minor of order at

Motivated by this close connection between attributes and relations, given a

individual words. The proposed method considers not only the co-occurrences of
words as done by existing approaches for word representation learning, but also
the semantic relations in which two words co-occur. To evaluate the accuracy of
the word representations learnt using the proposed method, we use the learnt

then determine rotational temperatures and column densities of 17 detected

non-LTE analysis of NH$_{3}$ shows that the bulk of its emission arises from
the inner envelope with a kinetic temperature of 70$\pm$20 K. Evidence for

potential abundance differences between various $^{13}$C-bearing isotopologues

effects on the chiral phase-transition in meson masses so that the restoration

mesonic states with respect to the lowest Matsubara frequency. It has been
found that the various mesonic states have different dissolving temperatures
and chemical potentials, i.e. they survive the typically-averaged QCD phase
boundary, defined by the QCD critical temperatures with varying chemical
potentials. The thermal behavior of all meson masses has been investigated in

masses, the large N_c limit unifies the $T$-dependence of all states in a
universal bundle. The same is also observed for axial and axialvector meson

increase rapidly with the number of parties. Therefore, we would like to
experimentally address the problem of how much information about multipartite

shown that some types of pure multipartite entangled states can be witnessed
without measuring the correlations [M. Walter et al., Science 340, 1205 (2013)]

method using an optical setup that permits the preparation and the complete

simple universal thermodynamic description of the electronic cloud surrounding
the nucleus in an atom. This model is known to be exact at the limit of
$Z\rightarrow\infty$, i.e., infinite nuclear charge, at finite density and
temperature. Motivated by the zero-temperature case, we show in the current
letter that the correction to TF due to quantum treatment of the strongly bound
inner-most electrons, for which the semi-classical approximation breaks, scales
as $Z^{-1/3}$, with respect to the TF solution. As such, it is more dominant
than the quantum corrections to the kinetic energy, as well as exchange and
correlation, which are known to be suppressed by $Z^{-2/3}$. We conjecture that
this is the leading correction for this model. In addition, we present a
different free energy functional for the TF model, and a successive functional
that includes the strongly bound electrons correction. We use this corrected
functional to derive a self-consistent potential and the electron density in
the atom, and to calculate the corrected energy. At this stage, our model has a
built-in validity limit, breaking as the L shell ionizes.

mass to create nearly symmetric leading and trailing tidal streams. We study
the case in which tidal heating drives mass loss from a low mass satellite. The
stream effectively has two dynamical components, a common angular momentum core
superposed with episodic pulses with a broader angular momentum distribution.
The pulses appear as spurs on the stream, oscillating above and below the
stream centerline, stretching and blurring in configuration space as they move
away from the cluster. Low orbital eccentricity streams are smoother and have
less differential motion than high eccentricity streams. The tail of a high
eccentricity stream can develop a fan of particles which wraps around at
apocenter in a shell feature. We show that scaling the essentially stationary
action-angle variables with the cube root of the satellite mass allows a low
mass satellite stream to accurately predict the features in the stream from a
satellite a thousand times more massive. As a practical astrophysical
application, we demonstrate that narrow gaps in a moderate eccentricity stream,
such as GD-1, blur out to 50\% contrast over approximately 6 radial periods. A
high eccentricity stream, such as Pal~5, will blur small gaps in only radial 2
orbits as can be understood from the much larger dispersion of angular momentum

possibility of experimentally obtaining a ""quasirepulsive"" regime in the upper
branch of the energy spectrum due to the rapid quench is currently being
debated, and the Stoner transition has mainly been investigated theoretically
by using perturbation theory or at high polarization, due to the limited

present a nonperturbative theoretical approach to the quasirepulsive upper
branch of a Fermi gas near a broad Feshbach resonance, and we determine the
finite-temperature phase diagram for the Stoner instability. Our results agree
well with the known quantum Monte-Carlo simulations at zero temperature, and we
recover the known virial expansion prediction at high temperature for arbitrary
interaction strengths. At resonance, we find that the Stoner transition
temperature becomes of the order of the Fermi temperature, around which the
molecule formation rate becomes vanishingly small. This suggests a feasible way
to observe Stoner ferromagnetism in the nondegenerate temperature regime.

than merely studying the average methylation level at individual positions. In
order to understand better the complexity of DNA methylation landscapes in
biological samples, it is important to study the diversity of these methylation
patterns. However, the accurate quantification of methylation patterns is
subject to sequencing errors and spurious signals due to incomplete bisulphite
conversion of cytosines. Results: A statistical model is developed which
accounts for the distribution of DNA methylation patterns at any given locus.
The model incorporates the effects of sequencing errors and spurious reads, and
enables estimation of the true underlying distribution of methylation patterns.

collecting area of space-based telescopes, the gamma-ray emission discovered by
the Fermi-LAT in $\sim$150 pulsars is largely unexplored at these energies. In
this regime, the uncertainties on the spectral data points and/or the
constraints from upper-limits are not sufficient to provide robust tests of
competing emission models in individual pulsars. The discovery of
power-law-type emission from the Crab pulsar at energies exceeding 100 GeV
provides a compelling justification for exploration of other pulsars at these
energies. We applied the method of Aperture Photometry to measure pulsar
emission spectra from Fermi-LAT data and present a stacked analysis of 115
pulsars selected from the Second Fermi-LAT Catalog of Gamma-ray Pulsars. This
analysis, which uses an average of $\sim$4.2 years of data per pulsar,
aggregates low-level emission which cannot be resolved in individual objects

rotational state. This was confirmed to some extent by Voyager 2 and Cassini

this aticle is to explore conditions for potential observations to meet in
order to estimate a maximal Lyapunov Exponent (mLE), which being positive is an
indicator of chaos and allows to characterise it quantitatively. Lightcurves
existing in literature as well as numerical simulations are examined using
standard tools of theory of chaos. It is found that existing datasets are too
short and undersampled to detect a positive mLE, although its presence is not
rejected. Analysis of simulated lightcurves leads to an assertion that
observations from one site should be performed over a year-long period to
detect a positive mLE, if present, in a reliable way. Another approach would be
to use 2---3 telescopes spread over the world to have observations distributed
more uniformly. This may be achieved without disrupting other observational
projects being conducted. The necessity of time-series to be stationary is
highly stressed.

filling factor $\nu=5/2$ is the Moore-Read (MR) Pfaffian state. A salient
problem, however, is that it does not occur exactly at the Coulomb interaction,
but rather at a modified interaction, which favors particle-hole symmetry
breaking. In an effort to find a better state, in this work, we investigate the
possible connection between the paired QH state and the antisymmetrized bilayer
ground state, which is inspired by the intriguing identity that the MR Pfaffian
state is entirely equivalent to the antisymmetrized projection of the bilayer
QH state called the Halperin (331) state, which is valid at interlayer
distance, $d$, roughly equal to the magnetic length, $l_{\rm B}$. Specifically,
by using exact diagonalization in the torus geometry, we show that the exact
$5/2$ state at a given Haldane pseudopotential variation is intimately
connected with the antisymmetrized bilayer ground state at a corresponding
$d/l_{\rm B}$ via one-to-one mapping, which we call the bilayer mapping. One of
the most important discoveries in this work is that the paired QH state
occurring at the Coulomb interaction is mapped onto the antisymmetrized bilayer
ground state at $d \gg l_{\rm B}$, which is equivalent to the antisymmetrized
product state of two composite fermion seas at quarter filling, not the MR
Pfaffian state. While maintaining high overlap with the paired QH state, the
antisymmetrized bilayer ground state at $d \gg l_{\rm B}$ exhibits an abrupt
change under the influence of small anisotropy. This suggests that the paired
QH state occurring at the Coulomb interaction might be susceptible to
anisotropic instability, opening up the possibility of anisotropic $p_x$ or
$p_y$-wave pairing instead of $p_x \pm i p_y$-wave pairing in the MR
Pfaffian/anti-Pfaffian state.

of $N$-body simulations, exploring a parameter space of groups falling into
clusters, to study the observed velocity distributions of the infall components
along various lines of sight. We show that, as viewed along a line of sight
parallel to the group's infall direction, there is a significant peculiar
velocity boost during the pericentric passage of the group, and an increase in
velocity dispersion that persists for many Gyr after the merger. The remnants
of the infalling group, however, do not form a spatially distinct system --
consistent with recent observations of dwarf galaxies in the Virgo and Fornax
clusters. This velocity signature is completely absent when viewed along a
direction perpendicular to the merger. Additionally, the phase-space
distribution of radial velocity along the infall direction versus
cluster-centric radius reveals the separate dynamical evolution of the group's
central core and outer halo, including the presence of infalling remnants
outside the escape velocity envelope of the system. The distinct signature in
velocity space of an infalling group's galaxies can therefore prove important
in understanding the dynamical history of clusters and their dwarfs. Our
results suggest that dwarf galaxies, being insensitive to dynamical friction,
are excellent probes of their host clusters' dynamical histories.

considerably constrain stellar evolution models that simultaneously relate
galaxy stellar mass, metallicity, and star formation rates (SFRs) to the infall
rate of low-metallicity extragalactic gas and outflow of enriched matter. A
feature of our model is that it encompasses both the active star forming phases
of a galaxy and epochs during which the same galaxy may lie fallow. We show
that the galaxy-mass-metallicity-star-formation relation can be traced to
infall of extragalactic gas mixing with native gas from host galaxies to form
stars of observed metallicities, the most massive of which eject oxygen into
extragalactic space. Most consequential among our findings is that, on average,
extragalactic infall accounts for one half of the gas required for star
formation, a ratio that is remarkably constant across galaxies with stellar
masses ranging at least from $M* = 2 \times 10^9$ to $6\times 10^{10}

extragalactic infall roughly doubles the mass of marginally stable interstellar
clouds. The processes described may also account quantitatively for the
metallicity of extragalactic space, though to check this the fraction of

similar optical and near-infrared properties in the field, strengthening the
conclusion that the cluster environment indeed depletes the HI gas reservoir of
these two galaxies. Here we also report observations of AM 0108-462 in several
optical and near-infrared bands using the Magellan 6.5 m telescopes, and
archival X-ray and ultraviolet observations with XMM-Newton and Swift. These
data combined with the HI line data suggest it is likely that AM 0108-462 is
experiencing a merger event.

Common method to neglect outliers from a data population is computation of mean
in a range defined by mean and standard deviation. In NLACM we perform the
median within the defined range based on statistical estimation of the
neighbourhood region of a pixel to be denoised. As parameters of the range are
independent of any additional input and is based on local intensity values,
hence the approach is adaptive. Experimental results for NLACM show better
estimation of true intensity from noisy neighbourhood observation as compared
to NLM at high noise levels. We have verified the technique for speckle noise
reduction and we have tested it on ultrasound (US) image of lumbar spine. These
ultrasound images act as guidance for injection therapy for treatment of lumbar

results in computer science. In particular, polynomial approximations to the
sign function underly algorithms for agnostically learning halfspaces, as well
as pseudorandom generators for halfspaces. In this work, we investigate the
limits of these techniques by proving inapproximability results for the sign
function.
  Firstly, the polynomial regression algorithm of Kalai et al. (SIAM J. Comput.
2008) shows that halfspaces can be learned with respect to log-concave
distributions on $\mathbb{R}^n$ in the challenging agnostic learning model. The
power of this algorithm relies on the fact that under log-concave
distributions, halfspaces can be approximated arbitrarily well by low-degree
polynomials. We ask whether this technique can be extended beyond log-concave
distributions, and establish a negative result. We show that polynomials of any
degree cannot approximate the sign function to within arbitrarily low error for
a large class of non-log-concave distributions on the real line, including
those with densities proportional to $\exp(-|x|^{0.99})$.
  Secondly, we investigate the derandomization of Chernoff-type concentration
inequalities. Chernoff-type tail bounds on sums of independent random variables
have pervasive applications in theoretical computer science. Schmidt et al.
(SIAM J. Discrete Math. 1995) showed that these inequalities can be established
for sums of random variables with only $O(\log(1/\delta))$-wise independence,
for a tail probability of $\delta$. We show that their results are tight up to
constant factors.
  These results rely on techniques from weighted approximation theory, which
studies how well functions on the real line can be approximated by polynomials
under various distributions. We believe that these techniques will have further
applications in other areas of computer science.

  L2 Approach","arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:1401.4312",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Conventional compressed sensing theory assumes signals have sparse
representations in a known, finite dictionary. Nevertheless, in many practical
applications such as direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation and line spectral
estimation, the sparsifying dictionary is usually characterized by a set of
unknown parameters in a continuous domain. To apply the conventional compressed
sensing technique to such applications, the continuous parameter space has to
be discretized to a finite set of grid points, based on which a ""presumed
dictionary"" is constructed for sparse signal recovery. Discretization, however,
inevitably incurs errors since the true parameters do not necessarily lie on
the discretized grid. This error, also referred to as grid mismatch, may lead
to deteriorated recovery performance or even recovery failure. To address this
issue, in this paper, we propose a generalized iterative reweighted L2 method
which jointly estimates the sparse signals and the unknown parameters
associated with the true dictionary. The proposed algorithm is developed by
iteratively decreasing a surrogate function majorizing a given objective
function, resulting in a gradual and interweaved iterative process to refine
the unknown parameters and the sparse signal. A simple yet effective scheme is
developed for adaptively updating the regularization parameter that controls
the tradeoff between the sparsity of the solution and the data fitting error.
Extension of the proposed algorithm to the multiple measurement vector scenario
is also considered. Numerical results show that the proposed algorithm achieves
a super-resolution accuracy and presents superiority over other existing
methods.

frequency results from the contribution of FEGC to the radial flow. The reason
for the reduction of damping rate is that when the effect of FEGC counts, the
new resonant velocity becomes much larger than ions thermal velocity with
equilibrium distribution obeying Maxwellian distribution, compared with

maximization of mutual information between forms and meanings and minimization
of form entropy. The family also sheds light on the origins of three other
patterns: the principle of contrast, a related vocabulary learning bias and the
meaning-frequency law. Here two important components of the family, namely the
information theoretic principles and the energy function that combines them
linearly, are reviewed from the perspective of psycholinguistics, language
learning, information theory and synergetic linguistics. The minimization of
this linear function is linked to the problem of compression of standard
information theory and might be tuned by self-organization.

those words occurring in complex environments in which infinitely many meanings

infinite referential uncertainty is often attributed to Willard Van Orman
Quine. We provide a mathematical formalisation of an ideal cross-situational
learner attempting to learn under infinite referential uncertainty, and
identify conditions under which word learning is possible. As Quine's
intuitions suggest, learning under infinite uncertainty is in fact possible,
provided that learners have some means of ranking candidate word meanings in
terms of their plausibility; furthermore, our analysis shows that this ranking
could in fact be exceedingly weak, implying that constraints which allow
learners to infer the plausibility of candidate word meanings could themselves
be weak. This approach lifts the burden of explanation from `smart' word
learning constraints in learners, and suggests a programme of research into
weak, unreliable, probabilistic constraints on the inference of word meaning in
real word learners.

modulation amplitude that is beyond the scope of the phenomenological model

field for scalar and tensor perturbations which affect the temperature

explain the scale dependent nature of the modulation field. The salient
prediction of this model is the direction dependent tensor to scalar ratio
which results in anisotropic Stochastic Gravitational Wave Background (SGWB).
This feature is potentially measurable from the $B$-mode polarization map of
Planck and BICEP-2 and leads to determination of the modulation strength.
Measurability of SI violated polarization field due to this model is estimated
for Planck and PRISM. Absence of the signal in the polarization field can
restrict the viability of the model.

attenuated due to the interactions with background radiation fields. The
magnetic fields traversed by the gamma rays are often turbulent and frequently

record method based on spectral synthesis techniques is used to recover
spatially and temporally resolved maps of stellar population properties of
spheroidal and spiral galaxies with masses $10^9$ to $7 \times 10^{11}$
M$_\odot$. The results show that galaxy-wide spatially averaged stellar
population properties (stellar mass, mass surface density, age, metallicity,
and extinction) match those obtained from the integrated spectrum, and that
these spatially averaged properties match those at $R = 1$ HLR (half light
radius), proving that the effective radii are really effective.
  Further, the individual radial profiles of the stellar mass surface density
($\mu_\star$), luminosity weighted ages ($< {\rm log}\,age>_L$), and mass
weighted metallicity ($< \log Z_\star >_M$) are stacked in bins of galaxy
morphology (E, S0, Sa, Sb, Sbc, Sc and Sd). All these properties show negative
gradients as a sign of the inside-out growth of massive galaxies. However, the
gradients depend on the Hubble type in different ways. For the same galaxy
mass, E and S0 galaxies show the largest inner gradients in $\mu_\star$; while
MW-like galaxies (Sb with $M_\star \sim 10^{11} M_\odot$) show the largest
inner age and metallicity gradients. The age and metallicity gradients suggest
that major mergers have a relevant role in growing the center (within 3 HLR) of
massive early type galaxies; and radial mixing may play a role flattening the
radial metallicity gradient in MW-like disks.

has been extended by Guerraoui and Ruppert to yield the community protocol
models where agents have unique identifiers but may only store a finite number
of the identifiers they already heard about. The population protocol models can
only compute semi-linear predicates, whereas in the community protocol model
the whole community of agents provides collectively the power of a Turing
machine with a O(n log n) space. We consider variations on the above models and
we obtain a whole landscape that covers and extends already known results: By
considering the case of homonyms, that is to say the case when several agents
may share the same identifier, we provide a hierarchy that goes from the case
of no identifier (i.e. a single one for all, i.e. the population protocol
model) to the case of unique identifiers (i.e. community protocol model). We
obtain in particular that any Turing Machine on space O(logO(1) n) can be
simulated with at least O(logO(1) n) identifiers, a result filling a gap left
open in all previous studies. Our results also extend and revisit in particular
the hierarchy provided by Chatzigiannakis et al. on population protocols

addition to the AMS-02 data, we add HESS data to estimate the spectra of CR
electrons and the diffuse gamma rays above TeV. In the conventional diffusion
model, a global analysis is performed on the spectral features of CR electrons
and the diffuse gamma rays by GALRPOP package. The results show that the
spectrum structure of the primary component of CR electrons can not be fully
reproduced by a simple power law and the relevant break is around hundred GeV.
At 99\% C.L., the injection indices above the break decrease from 2.54 to 2.35,
but the ones below the break are only in the range 2.746 - 2.751. The spectrum
of CR electrons does not need to add TeV cutoff to match the features of HESS
data too. Based on the difference between the fluxes of CR electrons and the
primary component of them, the predicted excess of CR positrons is consistent
with the interpretations as pulsar or dark matter. In the analysis of the
Galactic diffuse gamma rays with the indirect constraint of AMS-02 and HESS
data, it is found that the fluxes of Galactic diffuse gamma rays are consistent
with GeV data of Fermi-LAT in the high latitude regions. The results indicate
that the inverse Compton scattering(IC) is the dominant component in the range
of the hundred GeV to tens of TeV respectively from the high latitude regions

that, depending on the values of interaction parameters (for fixed $n$), the PS
state can occur in higher fields than the homogeneous SS phase (field-induced
PS). Moreover, a first-order SS-NO transition occurs between metastable phases
and these metastable phases can exist inside the regions of the PS state
stability. Such behaviour is associated with the presence of tricritical line

provide the view of effective zero-mode cloud around the quark and antiquark

convective zone in the red giant phase is prerequisite for the development of
the blue loop. Our second question concerns pulsational instability of models
in the core helium burning phase. We present for the first time that models on
the blue loop can have unstable modes driven by the $\kappa$ mechanism
operating in the $Z-$bump. Contrary to post-main sequence models in the shell
hydrogen burning phases, pulsational instability of the blue loop models
depends mainly on effective temperature and metallicity is of secondary
importance. Finally, we try to interpret the oscillation spectrum of the blue

exploits an anisotropic variant of the argument of Crippa and De Lellis and
suitable estimates for the difference quotients in such anisotropic context. In

describe the general prescription for this decomposition and the computation of
the tidal power. Although this formalism is very general, forcing due to a
companion on a misaligned, circular orbit is used to illustrate the theory. The
tidal power is plotted for a variety of orbital radii, misalignment angles, and
spheroid rotation rates. Our calculations are carried out including all modes
of degree $l \le 4$, and the same degree of gravitational forcing. Remarkably,
we find that for close orbits ($a/R_* \approx 3$) and rotational deformations
that are typical of giant planets ($e\approx 0.4$) the $l=4$ component of the
gravitational potential may significantly enhance the dissipation through
resonance with surface gravity modes. There are also a large number of
resonances with inertial modes, with the tidal power being locally enhanced by
up to three orders of magnitude. For very close orbits ($a/R_* \approx 3$), the

the limit of small quantum fluctuations. We show that, in the presence of
optomechanical coupling, the well-known classical phase diagram of the optical
problem gets modified by the appearance of new dynamical instabilities. As for
the quantum-mechanical description, we prove the ability of the squeezed
down-converted field to cool down the mechanical motion not only to thermal but
also to squeezed thermal mechanical states, and in a way that can be much less
sensitive to parameters (e.g., detuning of the driving laser) than standard
sideband cooling.

superconductivity, itinerant small moment antiferromagnetism and hidden order
of higher order multipoles of f-electrons which all lead to a gapping of the
heavy bands. In rare cases the chemical potential lies within the hybridization
gap and the ground state is a Kondo semiconductor without ordering. The
dynamical magnetic response of such gapped f-electron systems has been
investigated with inelastic neutron scattering. It was found that collective
spin exciton modes which are due to residual quasiparticle interactions appear
below the threshold of superconducting or hidden order gap or directly the
hybridzation gap. The spin exciton resonance is commonly located around a zone
boundary vector $Q$ with nesting properties in the normal state. In the
superconducting case its appearance gives a strong criterion for the gap
symmetry requesting a sign change $\Delta_{{\bf k}+{\bf Q}}=-\Delta_{\bf k}$

the supercurrent in an s-wave two-dimensional superconductor. At the same time,
the thermodynamically equilibrium state of such a system is characterized by
the helix phase where the order parameter varies in space as
$\exp(i\mathbf{Qr})$. In this state the electric current that is induced by the
Zeeman interaction is exactly counterbalanced by the current produced by the
gradient of the order-parameter. We studied the interplay of the helix state
and magnetoelectric current in the case of a varying in space Zeeman field, as
it might be realized in hybrid heterostructures with magnetic and
superconducting layers. The theoretical analysis was based on Usadel equations
for Green functions in a dirty superconductor. It is shown that even a weak
inhomogeneity produces a strong long-range effect on the magnetoelectric
current and the order-parameter phase. Consequently, depending on the
macroscopic shape of such an inhomogeneity, either the helix state with the
zero supercurrent, or a locally uniform state with the finite supercurrent are
realized. A mixture of these two extreme situations is also possible. It is
also shown that the current can be induced at a large distance from a
ferromagnetic island embedded into a superconductor. Quantum effects associated
with the magnetoelectric effect are briefly discussed for multiply connected
systems. The theory proposes a new point of view on interplay of the
magnetoelectric effect and helix phase in spin-orbit coupled superconductors.
It also suggests an interesting method allowing to couple superconducting and

intermediate-velocity cloud IVC135+54 and its spatially associated
high-velocity counterpart to look for signs of a past or ongoing interaction.
Using the Effelsberg-Bonn \ion{H}{i} Survey data, we investigated the interplay
of gas at different velocities. In combination with far-infrared Planck and
IRIS data, we extended this study to interstellar dust and used the correlation
of the data sets to infer information on the dark gas. The velocity structure
indicates a strong compression and deceleration of the infalling high-velocity
cloud (HVC), associated with far-infrared excess emission in the
intermediate-velocity cloud. This excess emission traces molecular hydrogen,
confirming that IVC135+54 is one of the very few molecular halo clouds. The
high dust emissivity of IVC135+54 with respect to the local gas implies that it
consists of disk material and does not, unlike the HVC, have an extragalactic
origin. Based on the velocity structure of the HVC and the dust content of the
IVC, a physical connection between them appears to be the logical conclusion.
Since this is not compatible with the distance difference between the two
objects, we conclude that this particular HVC might be much closer to us than
complex C. Alternatively, the indicators for an interaction are misleading and
have another origin.

exponential decay of the probabilities of incorrect matching as the sequence

economical alternative to field-bus installations for monitoring and control
applications. For mission-critical applications, communication networks must
provide end-to-end reliability guarantees, posing substantial challenges for
WSN. Reliability can be improved by redundancy, and is often addressed on the
MAC layer by re-submission of lost packets, usually applying slotted
scheduling. Recently, researchers have proposed a strategy to optimally improve
the reliability of a given schedule by repeating the most rewarding slots in a
schedule incrementally until a deadline. This Incrementer can be used with most
scheduling algorithms but has scalability issues which narrows its usability to
offline calculations of schedules, for networks that are rather static. In this
paper, we introduce SchedEx, a generic heuristic scheduling algorithm extension
which guarantees a user-defined end-to-end reliability. SchedEx produces
competitive schedules to the existing approach, and it does that consistently
more than an order of magnitude faster. The harsher the end-to-end reliability
demand of the network, the better SchedEx performs compared to the Incrementer.
We further show that SchedEx has a more evenly distributed improvement impact
on the scheduling algorithms, whereas the Incrementer favors schedules created
by certain scheduling algorithms.

finite temperatures smaller than the energy gap for bulk excitations in the

length of the Majorana states. The fluctuations, on the other hand, provide the
dominant contribution to the preexponential factor, which increases with
temperature and the length of the wire. More important is that thermal
fluctuations give rise to a decay of an initial correlation between Majorana
edge states to its stationary value after some thermalization time. This
stationary value is sensitive to the temperature and to the length of the wire,
and, although vanishing in the thermodynamic limit, can still be feasible in a
mesoscopic system at sufficiently low temperatures. The thermalization time, on
the other hand, is found to be much larger than the typical time scales in the
wire, and is sufficient for quantum operations with Majorana fermions before
the temperature-induced decoherence sets in.

to the {111} direction but have different local environments of their kink
sites and are thus a model for realistic roughened Pt surfaces. Alanine has
only a single methyl group attached to its chiral center, which makes the
number of possible binding conformations computationally tractable.
Additionally, only the amine and carboxyl group are expected to interact
strongly with the Pt substrate. On Pt(531) we study the molecule in its
pristine as well as its deprotonated form and find that the deprotonated one is
more stable by 0.39 eV. Therefore, we study the molecule in its deprotonated
form on Pt(321) and Pt(643). As expected, the oxygen and nitrogen atoms of the
deprotonated molecule provide a local binding ""tripod"" and the most stable
adsorption configurations optimize the interaction of this ""tripod"" with
undercoordinated surface atoms. However, the interaction of the methyl group
plays an important role: it induces significant chiral selectivity of about 60
meV on all surfaces. Hereby, the L-enantiomer adsorbs preferentially to the
Pt(321)$^S$ and Pt(643)$^S$ surfaces while the D-enantiomer is more stable on
Pt(531)$^S$. The binding energies increase with increasing surface density of
kink sites, i.e. they are largest for Pt(531)$^S$ and smallest for Pt(643)$^S$.

generally not zero even if the time average of the shear rate is zero. The
validity of the theoretical calculations is confirmed by direct numerical
simulations of the Smoluchowski equation. Nonadiabatic effects are also
investigated by simulations and it is found that the time-integrated stress
tensor depends on the speed of the modulation of the shear rate if we adopt the
isotropic distribution as an initial state.

Further, we propose the notion of radio co-location interference, which is

a new all-encompassing algorithm to create a radio co-location aware conflict

through theoretical interference estimates and comprehensive experiments. The
results of an extensive set of ns-3 simulations run on the IEEE 802.11g

a marked improvement over their conventional counterparts. We also question the
use of total interference degree as a reliable metric to predict the
performance of a Channel Assignment scheme in a given WMN deployment.

including clustering validation and ensemble clustering. Generally, such
distance measure provides navigation through the space of possible clusterings.
Mostly used in cluster validation, a normalized clustering distance, a.k.a.
agreement measure, compares a given clustering result against the ground-truth
clustering. Clustering agreement measures are often classified into two
families of pair-counting and information theoretic measures, with the
widely-used representatives of Adjusted Rand Index (ARI) and Normalized Mutual
Information (NMI), respectively. This paper sheds light on the relation between
these two families through a generalization. It further presents an alternative
algebraic formulation for these agreement measures which incorporates an
intuitive clustering distance, which is defined based on the analogous between
cluster overlaps and co-memberships of nodes in clusters. Unlike the original
measures, it is easily extendable for different cases, including overlapping
clusters and clusters of inter-related data for complex networks. These two
extensions are, in particular, important in the context of finding clusters in
social and information networks, a.k.a communities.

Kohn-Sham density-functional theory. The strategy of range-separated
density-functional theory consists in separating the Coulomb electron-electron

long-range part by an explicit many-body wave-function method and the
short-range part by a density-functional approximation. Among the advantages of
using many-body methods for the long-range part of the electron-electron
interaction is that they are much less sensitive to the one-electron atomic
basis compared to the case of the standard Coulomb interaction. Here, we
provide a detailed study of the basis convergence of range-separated
density-functional theory. We study the convergence of the partial-wave
expansion of the long-range wave function near the electron-electron
coalescence. We show that the rate of convergence is exponential with respect
to the maximal angular momentum L for the long-range wave function, whereas it
is polynomial for the case of the Coulomb interaction. We also study the
convergence of the long-range second-order M{{\o}}ller-Plesset correlation
energy of four systems (He, Ne, N2, and H2O) with the cardinal number X of the
Dunning basis sets cc-p(C)VXZ, and find that the error in the correlation
energy is best fitted by an exponential in X. This leads us to propose a
three-point complete-basis-set extrapolation scheme for range-separated
density-functional theory based on an exponential formula.

0420-014, OJ 287, and 1156+295 presented in Aller et al. (2014, Paper I),
quantifying how well the modeling constrains internal properties of the flow
(low energy spectral cutoff, partition between random and ordered magnetic
field), the flow dynamics (quiescent flow speed and orientation), and the
number and strength of the shocks responsible for radio-band flaring. We
conclude that well-sampled, multifrequency polarized flux light curves are
crucial for defining source properties. We argue for few, if any, low energy
particles in these flows, suggesting no entrainment and efficient energization
of jet material, and for approximate energy equipartition between the random
and ordered magnetic field components, suggesting that ordered field is built
by non-trivial dynamo action from the random component, or that the latter
arises from a jet instability that preserves the larger-scale, ordered flow. We
present evidence that the difference between orphan radio-band (no gamma-ray
counterpart) and non-orphan flares is due to more complex shock interactions in
the latter case.

non absorbed diffusion again behaves as a set of interacting particles evolving
in an absorbing medium. Between absorption times, the particles evolve
independently one from each other according to the diffusion semigroup; when a
particle is absorbed, another selected particle splits into two offsprings.
This article is concerned with the stability properties of these non absorbed

and some mild regularity properties of the hard obstacle boundaries, we prove
an uniform exponential strong mixing property of the process conditioned to not
be killed. We also provide uniform estimates w.r.t. the time horizon for the

  in Euclidean space $\mathbb{E}^{4}$",,,,,"math.DG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this study, we consider canal surfaces according to parallel transport
frame in Euclidean space $\mathbb{E}^{4}$. The curvature properties of these
surfaces are investigated with respect to $k_{1}$, $k_{2}$ and $k_{3}$ which
are principal curvature functions according to parallel transport frame. We
also give an example of canal surfaces in $\mathbb{E}^{4}.$ Further, we point
out that if spine curve $\gamma $ is a straight line, then $M$ is a Weingarten
canal surface and also $M$ is a linear Weingarten tube surface. Finally, the
visualization of the projections of canal surfaces in $\mathbb{E}^{3}$ are
shown.

where we relate strong and electroweak energy scales. The baryon states of
nucleon and delta resonances originate in specific Bloch wave degrees of
freedom coupled to a Higgs mechanism which also gives rise to the usual gauge
boson masses. The derived Higgs mass is around 125 GeV. From the same
Hamiltonian we derive the relative neutron to proton mass ratio and the N and
Delta mass spectra. All compare rather well with the experimental values. We
predict scarce neutral flavor baryon singlets that should be visible in
scattering cross sections for negative pions on protons, in photoproduction on
neutrons, in neutron diffraction dissociation experiments and in invariant mass
spectra of protons and negative pions in B-decays. The fundamental predictions
are based on just one length scale and the fine structure constant. More
particular predictions rely also on the weak mixing angle and the up-down quark
flavor mixing matrix element. With differential forms on the measure-scaled
wavefunction, we could generate approximate parton distribution functions for
the u and d valence quarks of the proton that compare well with established
experimental analysis.
