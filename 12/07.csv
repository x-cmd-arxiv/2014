solid media. In this paper, we present an analytical formulation for the
treatment of finite-strain Bloch waves in one-dimensional phononic crystals.
Considering longitudinal waves, the exact dispersion relation in each
homogeneous layer is first obtained and subsequently used within the transfer
matrix method to derive an approximate dispersion relation for the overall
periodic medium. The result is an amplitude-dependent elastic band structure
that may be used to elucidate the interplay between the waveform steepening and
spreading effects that emerge due to the nonlinearity and periodicity,
respectively. For example, for a wave amplitude on the order of one eighth of
the unit-cell size in a demonstrative structure, the two effects are
practically in balance for wavelengths as small as roughly three times the
unit-cell size.

distance of 11.5 kpc and observed across the entire electromagnetic spectrum
from radio to high energy (HE) Gamma-rays. Radio and infrared observations
indicate that the remnant is interacting with a molecular cloud. In this paper,
the detection of very high energy (VHE) Gamma-ray emission coincident with this
SNR with the High Energy Stereoscopic System (H.E.S.S.) is reported. An
integral flux F(E>400GeV)=(6.5 +-1.1stat +-1.3syst) x 10^{-13} ph/cm/s
corresponding to 0.7% of that of the Crab Nebula and to a luminosity of 10^34
erg/s above the same energy threshold, and a steep photon index Gamma_VHE = 2.8
+-0.27stat +-0.20syst are measured. The analysis of more than 5 yr of Fermi-LAT
data towards this source shows a power-law like spectrum with a best-fit photon
index Gamma_HE = 2.2 +-0.04stat +0.13-0.31syst. The combined Gamma-ray spectrum
of G349.7+0.2 can be described by either a broken power-law (BPL) or a
power-law with exponential (or sub-exponential) cutoff (PLC). In the former
case, the photon break energy is found at E_br,gamma = 55 +70-30 GeV, slightly
higher than what is usually observed in the HE/VHE Gamma-ray emitting
middle-aged SNRs known to be interacting with molecular clouds. In the latter
case, the exponential (respectively sub-exponential) cutoff energy is measured
at E_cut,gamma = 1.4 +1.6-0.55 (respectively 0.35 +0.75-0.21) TeV. A pion-decay
process resulting from the interaction of the accelerated protons and nuclei
with the dense surrounding medium is clearly the preferred scenario to explain
the Gamma-ray emission. The BPL with a spectral steepening of 0.5-1 and the PLC
provide equally good fits to the data. The product of the average gas density
and the total energy content of accelerated protons and nuclei amounts to nH Wp
~ 5 x 10^51 erg/cm3.

wind, require a generalization of General Magnetic Reconnection (GMR) theory.
We introduce the slip-velocity source vector, which gives the rate of
development of slip velocity per unit arc length of field line. The slip source
vector is the ratio of the curl of the non ideal electric field in the
Generalized Ohm's Law and the magnetic field strength. It diverges at magnetic
nulls, unifying GMR with magnetic null-point reconnection. Only under
restrictive assumptions is the slip velocity related to the gradient of the
quasi potential (integral of parallel electric field along field lines). In a
turbulent inertial range the curl becomes extremely large while the parallel
component is tiny, so that line slippage occurs even while ideal MHD becomes
accurate. The resolution of this paradox is that ideal MHD is valid for a
turbulent inertial-range only in a weak sense which does not imply magnetic
line freezing. The notion of weak solution is explained in terms of spatial
coarse-graining and renormalization group (RG) theory. We give an argument for
the weak validity of the ideal Ohm's law in the inertial range, via rigorous
estimates of the terms in the Generalized Ohm's Law for an electron-ion plasma.
All of the nonideal terms (from collisional resistivity, Hall field, electron
pressure anisotropy, and electron inertia) are shown to be irrelevant in the RG
sense and large-scale reconnection is thus governed solely by ideal dynamics.
We briefly discuss some implications for heliospheric reconnection, in
particular for deviations from the Parker spiral model of interplanetary
magnetic field. Solar wind observations show that reconnection in a turbulence
broadened heliospheric current sheet, consistent with the Lazarian-Vishniac
theory, leads to slip velocities that cause field lines to lag relative to the
spiral model.

of protocols based on security techniques to protect users' privacy. In
addition, our system incorporates tools that promote social interactions as a

extend Bayraktar and Young (2015) by allowing the individual to purchase term
life insurance to reach her bequest goal. The premium rate for life insurance,
$h$, serves as a parameter to connect two seemingly unrelated problems. As the
premium rate approaches $0$, covering the bequest goal becomes costless, so the
individual simply wants to avoid ruin that might result from her consumption.
Thus, as $h$ approaches $0$, the problem in this paper becomes equivalent to
minimizing the probability of lifetime ruin, which is solved in Young (2004).
On the other hand, as the premium rate becomes arbitrarily large, the
individual will not buy life insurance to reach her bequest goal. Thus, as $h$
approaches infinity, the problem in this paper becomes equivalent to maximizing
the probability of reaching the bequest goal when life insurance is not
available in the market, which is solved in Bayraktar and Young (2015).

These two ingredients are used to obtain the distance scales for neutrino beam

sterile neutrinos may experience terrestrial loss of coherence, and we

revealed many unusual effects of multiband superconductivity but manifestations
of anisotropic multiband effects in the critical current density Jc have not
been addressed experimentally, mostly because of the difficulties to measure Jc
along the c-axis. To investigate the effect of very different intrinsic
anisotropies of sigma and pi electron bands in MgB2 on current transport, we
grew epitaxial films with tilted c-axis (THETA ~ 19.5{\deg}), which enabled us
to measure the components of Jc both along the ab-plane and the c-axis using
magneto-optical and transport techniques. These measurements were combined with
scanning and transmission electron microscopy, which revealed terraced steps on
the surface of the c-axis tilted films. The measured field and temperature
dependencies of the anisotropic Jc(H) show that Jc,L parallel to the terraced
steps is higher than Jc,T perpendicular to the terraced steps, and Jc of
thinner films (50 nm) obtained from transport experiments at 0.1 T reaches ~10%
of the depairing current density Jd in the ab plane, while magneto-optical
imaging revealed much higher Jc at lower fields. To analyze the experimental
data we developed a model of anisotropic vortex pinning which accounts for the
observed behavior of Jc in the c-axis tilted films and suggests that the
apparent anisotropy of Jc is affected by current pairbreaking effects in the
weaker {\pi} band. Our results indicate that the out-of-plane current transport
mediated by the {\pi} band could set the ultimate limit of Jc in MgB2
polycrystals.

There

network snapshot, a number of applications are also interested in knowing the
potential importance of an individual in the future. However, current
centrality is not necessarily an effective predictor of future centrality.
While there are different measures of centrality, we focus on degree centrality
in this paper. We develop a method that reconciles preferential attachment and
triadic closure to capture a node's prominence profile. We show that the
proposed node prominence profile method is an effective predictor of degree
centrality. Notably, our analysis reveals that individuals in the early stage
of evolution display a distinctive and robust signature in degree centrality
trend, adequately predicted by their prominence profile. We evaluate our work
across four real-world social networks. Our findings have important

stars are found to be multiperiodic. The strongest secondary mode with
frequency f_2 has an amplitude of a few mmag, 20 - 45 times lower than the main
radial mode with frequency f_1. The two oscillations have a period ratio of
P_2/P_1 = 0.612 - 0.632 that cannot be reproduced by any two radial modes.
Thus, the secondary mode is nonradial. Modes yielding similar period ratios
have also recently been discovered in other variables of the RRc and RRd types.
These objects form a homogenous group and constitute a new class of multimode
RR Lyrae pulsators, analogous to a similar class of multimode classical
Cepheids in the Magellanic Clouds. Because a secondary mode with P_2/P_1 ~ 0.61
is found in almost every RRc and RRd star observed from space, this form of
multiperiodicity must be common. In all four Kepler RRc stars studied, we find
subharmonics of f_2 at ~1/2 f_2 and at ~3/2 f_2. This is a signature of period
doubling of the secondary oscillation, and is the first detection of period
doubling in RRc stars. The amplitudes and phases of f_2 and its subharmonics
are variable on a timescale of 10 - 200d. The dominant radial mode also shows
variations on the same timescale, but with much smaller amplitude. In three
Kepler RRc stars we detect additional periodicities, with amplitudes below
1mmag, that must correspond to nonradial g-modes. Such modes never before have
been observed in RR Lyrae variables.

depending linearly on the con-trol input and typically featuring concentration

a variety of challenging problems in high dimensional data analysis, including

chromatography approach to infer the parameter of interest under the proposed
semiparametric generalized linear model without the need of estimating the
unknown base measure function. (ii) We propose a new framework to construct
post-regularization confidence regions and tests for the low dimensional

inferential methods, our approach is based on a novel directional likelihood.
In particular, the framework naturally handles generic regularized estimators
with nonconvex penalty functions and it can be used to infer least false
parameters under misspecified models. (iii) We develop new concentration

kernels, which are of independent interest. We demonstrate the consequences of
the general theory by using an example of missing data problem. Extensive

for a non-iterative game in a well-mixed population. In contrast, structured
populations favor cooperation since cooperators can benefit each other by
forming local clusters. Previous studies have shown that scale-free networks
strongly promote cooperation. However, little is known about the invasion
mechanism of cooperation in scale-free networks. To study microscopic and
macroscopic behaviors of cooperators' invasion, we conducted computational
experiments of the evolution of cooperation in scale-free networks where,
starting from all defectors, cooperators can spontaneously emerge by mutation.
Since the evolutionary dynamics are influenced by the definition of fitness, we
tested two commonly adopted fitness functions: accumulated payoff and average
payoff. Simulation results show that cooperation is strongly enhanced with the
accumulated payoff fitness compared to the average payoff fitness. However, the
difference between the two functions decreases as the average degree increases.
As the average degree increases, cooperation decreases with the accumulated
payoff fitness, while it increases with the average payoff fitness. Moreover,
with the average payoff fitness, low-degree nodes play a more important role in
spreading cooperative strategies compared to the case of the accumulated payoff
fitness.

microscopy and first-principles theory, we examine the microscopic evolution
and redistribution of charged defects during the electrical cycling in BiFeO3

order are identified during the fatigue process. It reveals that the isolated
VO tend to self-order along grain boundaries to form a planar-aligned
structure, which blocks the domain reversals. Upon further electrical cycling,
migration of VO within vacancy clusters is accommodated with a lower energy
barrier (~0.2 eV) and facilitates the formation of nearby-electrode layer
incorporated with highly concentrated VO. The interplay between the macroscopic
fatigue and microscopic evolution of charged defects clearly demonstrates the
role of ordered VO cluster in the fatigue failure of BiFeO3 thin films.

distribution, given access to independent samples from it, are examined under
general $\ell_p$ metrics. The intuitions and results often contrast with the
classic $\ell_1$ case. For $p > 1$, we can learn and test with a number of
samples that is independent of the support size of the distribution: With an
$\ell_p$ tolerance $\epsilon$, $O(\max\{ \sqrt{1/\epsilon^q}, 1/\epsilon^2 \})$
samples suffice for testing uniformity and $O(\max\{ 1/\epsilon^q,
1/\epsilon^2\})$ samples suffice for learning, where $q=p/(p-1)$ is the
conjugate of $p$. As this parallels the intuition that $O(\sqrt{n})$ and $O(n)$
samples suffice for the $\ell_1$ case, it seems that $1/\epsilon^q$ acts as an
upper bound on the ""apparent"" support size.
  For some $\ell_p$ metrics, uniformity testing becomes easier over larger
supports: a 6-sided die requires fewer trials to test for fairness than a
2-sided coin, and a card-shuffler requires fewer trials than the die. In fact,
this inverse dependence on support size holds if and only if $p > \frac{4}{3}$.
The uniformity testing algorithm simply thresholds the number of ""collisions""
or ""coincidences"" and has an optimal sample complexity up to constant factors
for all $1 \leq p \leq 2$. Another algorithm gives order-optimal sample
complexity for $\ell_{\infty}$ uniformity testing. Meanwhile, the most natural
learning algorithm is shown to have order-optimal sample complexity for all
$\ell_p$ metrics.

directions are expected to be close to one another at nearby times. A simple
trend estimator that respects the geometry of the sphere is to compute a
running average over the time-ordered observed direction vectors, then
normalize these average vectors to unit length. This paper treats a
considerably richer class of competing directional trend estimators that
respect spherical geometry. The analysis relies on a nonparametric error model
for directional data in $R^q$ that imposes no symmetry or other shape
restrictions on the error distributions. Good trend estimators are selected by
comparing estimated risks of competing estimators under the error model.
Uniform laws of large numbers, from empirical process theory, establish when

the amount of concurrency in transaction processing because they can avoid
read-write conflicts. Unfortunately, the increase in concurrency usually comes
at the cost of transaction serializability. If a database user requests full
serializability, modern multi-versioned systems significantly constrain
read-write concurrency among conflicting transactions and employ expensive
synchronization patterns in their design. In main-memory multi-core settings,
these additional constraints are so burdensome that multi-versioned systems are
often significantly outperformed by single-version systems.
  We propose Bohm, a new concurrency control protocol for main-memory
multi-versioned database systems. Bohm guarantees serializable execution while
ensuring that reads never block writes. In addition, Bohm does not require
reads to perform any book-keeping whatsoever, thereby avoiding the overhead of
tracking reads via contended writes to shared memory. This leads to excellent
scalability and performance in multi-core settings. Bohm has all the above
characteristics without performing validation based concurrency control.
Instead, it is pessimistic, and is therefore not prone to excessive aborts in
the presence of contention. An experimental evaluation shows that Bohm performs
well in both high contention and low contention settings, and is able to
dramatically outperform state-of-the-art multi-versioned systems despite
maintaining the full set of serializability guarantees.

characteristics. Carbon monoxide observations show that IRAS 15103-5754 is an
evolved object, while the mid-IR spectrum displays unambiguous [NeII] emission,
indicating that photoionization has started and thus, its nature as a PN is
confirmed. Water maser spectra show several components spreading over a large
velocity range ~75 km/s and tracing a collimated jet. This indicates that the
object is a WF, the first WF known that has already entered the PN phase.
However, the spatial and kinematical distribution of the maser emission in this
object are significantly different from those in other WFs. Moreover, the
velocity distribution of the maser emission shows a ""Hubble-like"" flow (higher
velocities at larger distances from the central star), consistent with a
short-lived, explosive mass-loss event. This velocity pattern is not seen in
other WFs (presumably in earlier evolutionary stages). We therefore suggest
that we are witnessing a fundamental change of mass-loss processes in WFs, with
water masers being pumped by steady jets in post-AGB stars, but tracing
explosive/ballistic events as the object enters the PN phase.

direction, with the tilt angle tending to increase with latitude (""Joy's law"").
Observational determinations of Joy's law have been based either on white-light
images of sunspot groups or on magnetograms, where the latter have the
advantage of measuring directly the physically relevant quantity (the
photospheric field), but the disadvantage of having been recorded routinely
only since the mid-1960s. White-light studies employing the historical Mount
Wilson (MW) database have yielded tilt angles that are smaller and that
increase less steeply with latitude than those obtained from magnetic data. We
confirm this effect by comparing sunspot-group tilt angles from the Debrecen
Photoheliographic Database with measurements made by Li and Ulrich using MW
magnetograms taken during cycles 21--23. Whether white-light or magnetic data
are employed, the median tilt angles significantly exceed the mean values, and
provide a better characterization of the observed distributions. The
discrepancy between the white-light and magnetic results is found to have two
main sources. First, a substantial fraction of the white-light ""tilt angles""
refer to sunspots of the same polarity. Of greater physical significance is
that the magnetograph measurements include the contribution of plage areas,
which are invisible in white-light images but tend to have greater axial
inclinations than the adjacent sunspots. Given the large uncertainties inherent
in both the white-light and the magnetic measurements, it remains unclear
whether any systematic relationship exists between tilt angle and cycle
amplitude during cycles 16--23.

terrestrial gamma ray is proposed. This approach is based on two-stage Monte
Carlo simulation. First, the probability distributions of the phase space
coordinates of the events that are most likely to be detected are reconstructed
at the phase space shell level. The phase space shell is a closed surface
enclosing the detector. The detector response to events originating from the
phase space shell is then studied. The full absorption spectra as well as the
partial absorption spectra are obtained for natural radionuclides uniformly
distributed in the ground. For validation, this method is applied to a HpGe
portable detector previously studied. The previous study is based on a
semi-empirical model. Good agreement is achieved when we compare the full
energy peak efficiencies and the total in-situ spectra obtained by the two
methods. As an application, the effective depth of the activity of the 137Cs
artificial radionuclide in the soil is determined from the low-energy part of
the total in-situ spectrum.

explanations for why a tuple is missing from a query result. Our why-not
explanations leverage concepts from an ontology to provide high-level and
meaningful reasons for why a tuple is missing from the result of a query. A key
algorithmic problem in our framework is that of computing a most-general
explanation for a why-not question, relative to an ontology, which can either
be provided by the user, or it may be automatically derived from the data
and/or schema. We study the complexity of this problem and associated problems,
and present concrete algorithms for computing why-not explanations. In the case
where an external ontology is provided, we first show that the problem of
deciding the existence of an explanation to a why-not question is NP-complete
in general. However, the problem is solvable in polynomial time for queries of
bounded arity, provided that the ontology is specified in a suitable language,
such as a member of the DL-Lite family of description logics, which allows for
efficient concept subsumption checking. Furthermore, we show that a
most-general explanation can be computed in polynomial time in this case. In
addition, we propose a method for deriving a suitable (virtual) ontology from a
database and/or a data workspace schema, and we present an algorithm for
computing a most-general explanation to a why-not question, relative to such
ontologies. This algorithm runs in polynomial-time in the case when concepts
are defined in a selection-free language, or if the underlying schema is fixed.
Finally, we also study the problem of computing short most-general
explanations, and we briefly discuss alternative definitions of what it means
to be an explanation, and to be most general.

  Rounds on the Congested Clique",,,,,"cs.DC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper considers the \textit{minimum spanning tree (MST)} problem in the
Congested Clique model and presents an algorithm that runs in $O(\log \log \log
n)$ rounds, with high probability. Prior to this, the fastest MST algorithm in
this model was a deterministic algorithm due to Lotker et al.~(SIAM J on Comp,
2005) from about a decade ago. A key step along the way to designing this MST
algorithm is a \textit{connectivity verification} algorithm that not only runs
in $O(\log \log \log n)$ rounds with high probability, but also has low message
complexity. This allows the fast computation of an MST by running multiple
instances of the connectivity verification algorithm in parallel. These results
depend on a new edge-sampling theorem, developed in the paper, that says that
if each edge $e = \{u, v\}$ is sampled independently with probability $c \log^2
n/\min\{\mbox{degree}(u), \mbox{degree}(v)\}$ (for a large enough constant $c$)
then all cuts of size at least $n$ are approximated in the sampled graph. This
sampling theorem is inspired by series of papers on graph sparsification via
random edge sampling due to Karger~(STOC 1994), Bencz\'ur and Karger~(STOC
1996, arxiv 2002), and Fung et al.~(STOC 2011). The edge sampling techniques in
these papers use probabilities that are functions of edge-connectivity or a
related measure called edge-strength. For the purposes of this paper, these
edge-connectivity measures seem too costly to compute and the main technical
contribution of this paper is to show that degree-based edge-sampling suffices
to approximate large cuts.

and annihilation in $B\to PV$ decays within the QCD factorization framework.
With available experimental data on $B\to \pi K^{\ast}$, $\rho K$, $\pi \rho$
and $K\phi$ decays, comprehensive $\chi^2$ analyses of the parameters
$X_{A,H}^{i,f}({\rho}_{A,H}^{i,f},{\phi}_{A,H}^{i,f})$ are performed, where
$X_A^f$ ($X_A^i$) and $X_H$ are used to parameterize the endpoint divergences
of the (non)factorizable annihilation and hard spectator scattering amplitudes,
respectively. Based on $\chi^2$ analyses, it is observed that (1) The
topology-dependent parameterization scheme is feasible for $B\to PV$ decays;
(2) At the current accuracy of experimental measurements and theoretical
evaluations, $X_H=X_A^i$ is allowed by $B\to PV$ decays, but $X_{H}\neq X_A^f$
at $68%$ C. L.; (3) With the simplification $X_H=X_A^i$, parameters $X_A^f$ and
$X_A^i$ should be treated individually. The above-described findings are very
similar to those obtained from $B\to PP$ decays. Numerically, for $B\to PV$
decays, we obtain $(\rho_{A,H}^i,\phi_{A,H}^i[^{\circ}])
=(2.87^{+0.66}_{-1.95}, -145^{+14}_{-21})$ and $(\rho_A^f,\phi_A^f[^{\circ}]) =
(0.91^{+0.12}_{-0.13}, -37^{+10}_{-9})$ at $68%$ C. L.. With the best-fit
values, most of the theoretical results are in good agreement with the
experimental data within errors. However, significant corrections to the
color-suppressed tree amplitude $\alpha_2$ related to a large $\rho_H$ result
in the wrong sign for $A^{dir}_{CP}(B^- \to \pi^0 K^{{\ast}-})$ compared with
the most recent BABAR data, which presents a new obstacle in solving ""$\pi\pi$""
and ""$\pi K$"" puzzles through $\alpha_2$. A crosscheck with measurements at
Belle (or Belle II) and LHCb, which offer higher precision, is urgently
expected to confirm or refute such possible mismatch.

algorithm for periodic data collection and transmission in wireless sensor

sensor network is formed based on the residual energy level available at the
nodes and the number of uncovered neighbors of a node during tree formation.
Only nodes that have a relatively larger number of neighbors as well as a
higher energy level are included as intermediate nodes in the EMLN-DG tree. By
maximizing the number of leaf nodes in a DG tree and considering the energy
level available at the nodes while forming the tree, we reduce energy
consumption per round as well as balance the energy level across all the nodes
in the network. This contributes to a significantly larger network lifetime,
measured as the number of rounds before the first node failure due to
exhaustion of battery charge. Performance comparison studies with the
well-known data gathering algorithms such as LEACH and PEGASIS illustrate that
EMLN-DG can help to sustain the network for a significantly larger number of
rounds and at the same time incur a lower, or if not comparable, energy loss,
delay and energy loss*delay per round of data gathering.

study the three loop corrections to the energy-momentum tensor of massless
$\lambda \phi^4$ theory in the background of classical Liouville gravity in

screened in sharp contrast to the massless $\lambda \phi^4$ theory in $D=4$
dimensions due to the sign difference between the cosmological constant of the

of characterizing confidence regions with exact confidence levels for linear
regression and linear dynamical systems parameter estimation problems if the
noise distribution is symmetric. This paper describes a general family of
hypothesis testing methods that have an exact user chosen confidence level
based on finite sample count and without relying on an assumed noise
distribution. It is shown that the SPS method belongs to this family and we
provide another hypothesis test for the case where the symmetry assumption is
replaced with exchangeability. In the case of linear regression problems it is
shown that the confidence regions are connected, bounded and possibly
non-convex sets in both cases. To highlight the importance of understanding the
structure of confidence regions corresponding to such hypothesis tests it is
shown that confidence sets for linear dynamical systems parameter estimates
generated using the SPS method can have non-connected parts, which have far

Depending on various physical parameters, gas and grains are allowed to
interact with each other through exchange of their chemical species. It is
known that HCO+ and N2H+ are two abundant gas phase ions in ISM and their
deuterium fractionation are generally used to predict degree of ionization in
various regions of a molecular cloud. To have a more realistic estimation, we
consider a density profile of a collapsing cloud. We present radial
distributions of important interstellar molecules along with their deuterated
isotopomers. We carry out quantum chemical simulation to study effects of
isotopic substitution on spectral properties of these important interstellar
species. We calculate vibrational (harmonic) frequency of the most important
deuterated species (neutral & ions). Rotational and distortional constants of
these molecules are also computed to predict rotational transitions of these

particular, the rule of ND works to select the nearest node in the descending
direction of potential as the parent node of each node, which is in essence
different from the classical Gradient Descent or Steepest Descent. The
constructed In-Tree proves a very good candidate for clustering due to its
particular features and properties. In the In-Tree, the original clustering
problem is reduced to a problem of removing a very few of undesired edges from
this graph. Pleasingly, the undesired edges in In-Tree are so distinguishable
that they can be easily determined in either automatic or interactive way,
which is in stark contrast to the cases in the widely used Minimal Spanning
Tree and k-nearest-neighbor graph. The cluster number in the proposed method
can be easily determined based on some intermediate plots, and the cluster
assignment for each node is easily made by quickly searching its root node in
each sub-graph (also an In-Tree). The proposed method is extensively evaluated
on both synthetic and real-world datasets. Overall, the proposed clustering
method is a density-based one, but shows significant differences and advantages
in comparison to the traditional ones. The proposed method is simple yet
efficient and reliable, and is applicable to various datasets with diverse
