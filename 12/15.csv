fact that galactic halo contains huge amount of nonluminous matter, the so
called gravitational dark matter. The nature of dark matter is a point of
debate among the researchers. Recent observations reported the presence of ions
of O, S, C, Si etc in the galactic halo and intergalactic medium. This supports
the possibility of existence of electric field in the galactic halo region. We
therefore propose a model of galactic halo considering this electric field
arising due to charged particles as one of the inputs for the background
spacetime metric. Considering dark matter as an anisotropic fluid we obtain the
expressions for energy density and pressure of dark matter there and
consequently the equation of state of dark matter. Various other aspects of the
solutions are also analyzed along with a critical comparison with and
constraints of different observational evidences.

fundamental importance for a wide range of questions in astrophysics,
atmospheric physics, oceanography, and technology. Laboratory experiments and
numerical simulations have demonstrated that heavy particles respond in
intricate ways to turbulent fluctuations of the carrying fluid: non-interacting
particles may cluster together and form spatial patterns even though the fluid
is incompressible, and the relative speeds of nearby particles can fluctuate
strongly. Both phenomena depend sensitively on the parameters of the system.
This parameter dependence is difficult to model from first principles since
turbulence plays an essential role. Laboratory experiments are also very
difficult, precisely since they must refer to a turbulent environment. But in
recent years it has become clear that important aspects of the dynamics of
heavy particles in turbulence can be understood in terms of statistical models
where the turbulent fluctuations are approximated by Gaussian random functions
with appropriate correlation functions. In this review we summarise how such
statistical-model calculations have led to a detailed understanding of the
factors that determine heavy-particle dynamics in turbulence. We concentrate on
spatial clustering of heavy particles in turbulence. This is an important
question because spatial clustering affects the collision rate between the
particles and thus the long-term fate of the system.

other benefits of cloud computing, outsourcing PPDM tasks to the cloud

where n entities outsource their databases (in encrypted format) to the cloud
and ask the cloud to perform the clustering task on their combined data in a
privacy-preserving manner. We term such a process as privacy-preserving and
outsourced distributed clustering (PPODC). In this paper, we propose a novel
and efficient solution to the PPODC problem based on k-means clustering
algorithm. The main novelty of our solution lies in avoiding the secure
division operations required in computing cluster centers altogether through an
efficient transformation technique. Our solution builds the clusters securely
in an iterative fashion and returns the final cluster centers to all entities
when a pre-determined termination condition holds. The proposed solution
protects data confidentiality of all the participating entities under the
standard semi-honest model. To the best of our knowledge, ours is the first
work to discuss and propose a comprehensive solution to the PPODC problem that
incurs negligible cost on the participating entities. We theoretically estimate
both the computation and communication costs of the proposed protocol and also
demonstrate its practical value through experiments on a real dataset.

was predicted to be a 3D Dirac semimetal, a feature confirmed by recent

materials that are known to possess ultra-high mobility and giant

the first observation of a gate-induced transition from band conduction to
hopping conduction in single-crystalline Cd3As2 thin films via electrostatic
doping by solid electrolyte gating. The extreme charge doping enables the
unexpected observation of p-type conductivity in a 50 nm-thick Cd3As2 thin film
grown by molecular beam epitaxy. More importantly, the gate-tunable
Shubnikov-de Haas (SdH) oscillations and the temperature-dependent resistance
reveal a unique band structure and bandgap opening when the dimensionality of
Cd3As2 is reduced. This is also confirmed by our first-principles calculations.
The present results offer new insights towards nanoelectronic and

often generated that need data compression techniques to reduce the cost of
signal transfer and storage. Compressive sensing (CS) is a novel data
acquisition method whereby the compression is done in a sensor simultaneously
with the sampling. If the original sensed signal is sufficiently sparse in
terms of some basis, the decompression can be done essentially perfectly up to
some critical compression ratio. In this article, a Bayesian compressive
sensing (BCS) method is investigated that uses sparse Bayesian learning to
reconstruct signals from a compressive sensor. By explicitly quantifying the
uncertainty in the reconstructed signal, the BCS technique exhibits an obvious
benefit over existing regularized norm-minimization CS methods that provide a
single signal estimate. However, current BCS algorithms suffer from a
robustness problem: sometimes the reconstruction errors are very large when the
number of measurements is a lot less than the number of signal degrees of
freedom that are needed to capture the signal accurately in a directly sampled
form. In this paper, we present improvements to the BCS reconstruction method
to enhance its robustness so that even higher compression ratios can be used
and we examine the tradeoff between efficiently compressing data and accurately
decompressing it. Synthetic data and actual acceleration data collected from a
bridge SHM system are used as examples. Compared with the state-of-the-art BCS
reconstruction algorithms, the improved BCS algorithm demonstrates superior
performance. With the same reconstruction error, the proposed BCS algorithm
works with relatively large compression ratios and it can achieve perfect
lossless compression performance with quite high compression ratios.
Furthermore, the error bars for the signal reconstruction are also quantified
effectively.

implementation requires information about each route, and queueing delays can
grow super-linearly with route length. For large networks, where packets over

Proportional Scheduler has the advantage that information about the network's
route structure is not required for scheduling, which substantially improves
the policy's performance for large networks. For instance, packets can be

However, its performance is seriously weakened if imperfect coordination

inter-cell overhead message delays such that a seemingly astonishing CoMP
throughput gain is attained. In this paper, the quantization error and delay
that actually exist in overhead messages was modeled and we developed a much
tractable SIR model based on the stochastic geometry framework. We proposed
adaptive CoMP that is applied to downlink zero-forcing beamforming (ZFBF) and
it can mitigate the interference from the coordinated cells with delayed
overhead messages. The bounds on the complementary cumulative distribution
function (CCDF) of the SIR of a user are characterized such that the average
throughput of a user is able to be analytically evaluated. Numerical results
show that the proposed adaptive CoMP scheme can make the throughput gain very
robust to the overhead delay and thus significantly increase the throughput

liquid argon TPCs. The drifting charges after being extracted from the liquid
are amplified in the LEM positioned half a centimeter above the liquid in pure
argon vapor at 87 K. The LEM is characterised by the size of its dielectric rim
around the holes, the thickness of the LEM insulator, the diameter of the holes
as well as their geometrical layout. The impact of those design parameters on
the amplification were checked by testing seven different LEMs with an active
area of 10$\times$10 cm$^2$ in a double phase liquid argon TPC of 21 cm drift.
We studied their response in terms of maximal reachable gain and impact on the
collected charge uniformity as well as the long term stability of the gain. We
show that we could reach maximal gains of around 150 which corresponds to a
signal-to-noise ratio ($S/N$) of about 800 for a minimal ionising particle

surfaces in the vicinity of the LEM holes charge up with different time

Gray total-body-irradiation were studied to determine if immune reconstitution
could be described as a dynamical system. Survival, relapse, and graft vs. host
disease (GVHD) were not significantly different in two cohorts of patients
receiving different doses of ATG. However, donor-derived CD3+ (ddCD3) cell
reconstitution was superior in the lower ATG dose cohort, and there were fewer
instances of donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI). Lymphoid recovery was plotted in
each individual over time and demonstrated one of three sigmoid growth
patterns; Pattern A (n=15), had rapid growth with high lymphocyte counts,
pattern B (n=14), slower growth with intermediate recovery and pattern C, poor
lymphocyte reconstitution (n=10). There was a significant association between
lymphocyte recovery patterns and both the rate of change of ddCD3 at day 30
post-SCT and the clinical outcomes. GVHD was observed more frequently with
pattern A; relapse and DLI more so with pattern C, with a consequent survival
advantage in patients with patterns A and B. We conclude that evaluating immune
reconstitution following SCT as a dynamical system may differentiate patients
at risk of adverse outcomes and allow early intervention to modulate that risk.

different partial wave channels, scattering with SOC is in general a coupled
multichannel problem. A systematic method is introduced to analytically solve a
class of coupled differential equations by recasting the coupled channel
problem as a simple eigenvalue problem. The exact Green's matrix in the
presence of SOC is found, which readily gives the scattering solutions for any
two identical particles in any total angular momentum subspace having
negligible center of mass momentum. Application of this formalism to two spin-1
bosons shows the ubiquitous low energy threshold behavior for systems with
isotropic SOC. A modified threshold behavior shows up, which does not occur for
the spin-orbit coupled spin-1/2 system. We also confirm the parity-breaking
mechanism for the spontaneous emergency of handedness, that has been proposed
by Duan et. al. [1]. Additionally, a two-body bound state is found for any

lowered below the physiological permittivity, indicating dielectric saturation
perpendicular to the field. By comparison with Molecular Dynamics simulations

dielectric saturation and improves the agreement with simulation data at weak

$X$, as defined by Mazzeo and Melrose. We give pointwise bounds on the spectral
measure for the operator $(\Delta - n^2/4)_+^{1/2}$ on such manifolds, under
the assumptions that $X$ is nontrapping and there is no resonance at the bottom
of the spectrum. This uses the construction of the resolvent given by Mazzeo

S\'a Barreto and Vasy (high energy estimates for a perturbation of the
hyperbolic metric) and the present authors (see also the work by Yiran Wang) in
the general high-energy case.
  Under the additional assumption that $X$ has negative curvature everywhere,
we give two applications of the spectral measure estimates. The first,
following work due to Guillarmou and Sikora with the second author in the
asymptotically conic case, is a restriction theorem, that is, a $L^p(X) \to
L^{p'}(X)$ operator norm bound on the spectral measure. The second is a
spectral multiplier result, that is, a bound on functions $F((\Delta -

function $F$. Compared to the asymptotically conic case, our spectral
multiplier result is weaker, but the restriction estimate is stronger. In both
cases, the difference can be traced to the exponential volume growth at
infinity for asymptotically hyperbolic manifolds, as opposed to polynomial
growth in the asymptotically conic setting.

semi-analytical quantum impurity solver (QIS) in the context of the dynamical
mean-field theory (DMFT) for the periodic Anderson model and it correctly
captures the low energy Kondo scale for the single impurity model, having
excellent agreement with the Bethe ansatz and numerical renormalization group
results. However, the most common correlated lattice model, the Hubbard model,
has not been explored well within the LMA+DMFT framework beyond the insulating
phase. Here in our work, within the framework we attempt to complete the phase
diagram of the single band Hubbard model at zero temperature. Our formalism is
generic to any particle filling and can be extended to finite temperature. We
contrast our results with another QIS, namely the iterated perturbation theory
(IPT) and show that the second spectral moment sum-rule improves better as the
Hubbard interaction strength grows stronger in LMA, whereas it severely breaks
down after the Mott transition in IPT. We also show that, in the metallic
phase, the low-energy scaling of the spectral density leads to universality
which extends to infinite frequency range at infinite correlation strength

included in the objective function due to many variational models established

method is derived from the idea of the quasi-Newton method, and the fixed-point
algorithms based on the proximity operator, which were widely investigated very
recently. Utilizing the non-expansion property of the proximity operator we
further investigate the global convergence of the proposed algorithm. Numerical
experiments on image deblurring problem with additive or multiplicative noise
are presented to demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is superior to the
recently developed fixed-point algorithm in the computational efficiency.

  typographical error in Eq. 6 exponent",,"10.1093/mnras/stv030",,"astro-ph.EP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The majority of discovered exoplanetary systems harbour a new class of
planets, bodies typically several times more massive than Earth but orbiting
their host stars well inside the orbit of Mercury. The origin of these close-in
super-Earths and mini-Neptunes is a major unanswered question in planet
formation. Unlike Earth, whose atmosphere contains $<10^{-6}$ its total mass, a
large fraction of close-in planets have significant gaseous envelopes,
containing $1 -10\%$ or more of their total mass. It has been proposed that
these close-in planets formed in situ either by delivery of $50-100M_{\oplus}$
of rocky material to the inner disc, or in a disc enhanced relative to the
MMSN. In both cases, final assembly of the planets occurs by giant impacts
(GIs). Here we test the viability of these scenarios. We show that atmospheres
accreted by isolation masses are small ($10^{-3}-10^{-2}$ the core mass) and
that atmospheric mass-loss during GIs is significant, with typical post-GI
atmospheres that are $8 \times 10^{-4}$ the core mass. Such values are
consistent with terrestrial planet atmospheres but more than an order of
magnitude below atmospheric masses of $1-10\%$ inferred for many close-in
exoplanets. In the most optimistic scenario with no core luminosity, post-GI
envelope accretion from a depleted gas disc yields atmospheric masses that are
several per cent the core mass. If the gravitational potential energy due to
the last mass doubling of the planet by GIs is released over the disc
dissipation time-scale as core luminosity, then envelope masses are reduced by
about an order of magnitude. Finally we show that radial drift time-scales due
to gas drag for many isolation masses are shorter than typical disc lifetimes.
Given these challenges, we conclude that most observed close-in planets with
envelopes larger than several per cent likely formed at larger separations from
their host stars.

of a new ring of (anti-)commuting variables and the concept of an exact Bianchi
form, we demonstrate a significantly streamlined method for analyzing
superforms. We also study the dimensional reduction of superforms and how the
relative cohomology of the superspaces involved allows for the construction of
additional closed forms not in the main complex. In particular, the entire de
Rham complex of closed superforms in five-dimensional superspace with eight
supercharges $(N = 1)$ is derived from the complex in the corresponding
six-dimensional superspace. As a concluding effort, we work out the component
formulation for the matter multiplets defined by five-dimensional $p$-form
field-strengths for $p = 2, 3, 4$. The first and last of these come directly
from the de Rham complex and coincide with multiplets that are already
well-known, while the 3-form field-strength multiplet happens to require
additional effort to find. This leads to the conclusion that, in general, the
super-de Rham complex is not the result of supersymmetrizing the bosonic de

In the experimentally prepared single crystals, the CDW is completely

hypothetic 1\emph{T}-TaSeTe with ordered Se/Ta/Te stacking shows instability in
the phonon dispersion, indicating the presence of CDW in the ideally ordered
sample. The contradictory between experimental and theoretical results suggests
that the CDW is suppressed by disorder in 1\emph{T}-TaSe$_{2-x}$Te$_x$. The
formation and suppression of CDW are found to be independent with Fermi surface
nesting based on the generated electron susceptibility calculations. The

the ratio of the Laplacian of the gravitational scalar potential difference

lensing avoids intrinsic alignments while also lacking a hard limit on the lens
redshift and significant uncertainties in the source plane. We model $E_G$ for
general relativity and modified gravity, finding that $E_G$ for $f(R)$ gravity
should be scale-dependent due to the scale-dependence of the growth rate $f$.
Next, we construct an estimator for $E_G$ in terms of the galaxy-CMB lensing
and galaxy clustering angular power spectra, along with the RSD parameter
$\beta$. We also forecast statistical errors for $E_G$ from the current Planck
CMB lensing map and the spectroscopic galaxy and quasar samples from the Sloan
Digital Sky Survey Data Release 11, being 9% with galaxies and 8% when quasars
are included. We also find that upcoming spectroscopic and photometric surveys,
combined with the final Planck lensing map, can measure precisely the redshift-
and scale-dependence of $E_G$ out to redshifts $z=2$ and higher, with
photometric surveys having an advantage due to their high number densities.
Advanced ACTPol's lensing map will increase the $E_G$ sensitivity even further.
Finally, we find that Advanced ACTPol cross-correlated with spectroscopic
(photometric) surveys can differentiate between general relativity and $f(R)$
gravity at the level of $3\sigma$ ($13\sigma$). Performing a $<1$% measurement
of $E_G$ requires a 10% precision in $\beta$ from Euclid or LSST, currently

resource is a (non-decreasing) function of the set of its users. Under the
assumption that the costs of the resources are shared by uniform cost sharing
protocols, i.e., protocols that use only local information of the resource's
cost structure and its users to determine the cost shares, we exactly quantify
the inefficiency of the resulting pure Nash equilibria. Specifically, we show
tight bounds on prices of stability and anarchy for games with only submodular
and only supermodular cost functions, respectively, and an asymptotically tight
bound for games with arbitrary set-functions. While all our upper bounds are
attained for the well-known Shapley cost sharing protocol, our lower bounds
hold for arbitrary uniform cost sharing protocols and are even valid for games
with anonymous costs, i.e., games in which the cost of each resource only
depends on the cardinality of the set of its users.

the system throughput under the umbrella of a large network (e.g., large cell),
is a promising architecture for the 5G wireless communication networks, where
green and sustainable communication is also a key aspect. Renewable energy
based communication via energy harvesting (EH) devices is one of such green
technology candidates. In this paper, we study an uplink transmission scenario
under a heterogeneous network hierarchy, where each mobile user (MU) is powered
by a sustainable energy supply, capable of both deterministic access to the
large network via one private channel, and dynamic access to a small network
with certain probability via one common channel shared by multiple MUs.
Considering a general EH model, i.e., energy arrivals are time-correlated, we
study an opportunistic transmission scheme and aim to maximize the average
throughput for each MU, which jointly exploits the statistics and current
states of the private channel, common channel, battery level, and EH rate.
Applying a simple yet efficient ""save-then-transmit"" scheme, the throughput
maximization problem is cast as a ""rate-of-return"" optimal stopping problem.
The optimal stopping rule is proved to has a time-dependent threshold-based
structure for the case with general Markovian system dynamics, and degrades to
a pure threshold policy for the case with independent and identically
distributed system dynamics. As performance benchmarks, the optimal power
allocation scheme with conventional power supplies is also examined. Finally,
numerical results are presented, and a new concept of ""EH diversity"" is
discussed.

research. Evaluating a query on a graph results in a relation on the set of its

graph. Some relations may not be definable by any query in a given language.
This leads to the following question: given a graph, a query language and a
relation on the graph, does there exist a query in the language that defines
the relation? This is called the definability problem. When the given query
language is standard regular expressions, the definability problem is known to
be PSPACE-complete.
  The model of graphs can be extended by labeling nodes with values from an
infinite domain. These labels induce a partition on the set of nodes: two nodes
are equivalent if they are labeled by the same value. Query languages can also
be extended to make use of this equivalence. Two such extensions are Regular
Expressions with Memory (REM) and Regular Expressions with Equality (REE).
  In this paper, we study the complexity of the definability problem in this
extended model when the query language is either REM or REE. We show that the
definability problem is EXPSPACE-complete when the query language is REM, and
it is PSPACE-complete when the query language is REE. In addition, when the
query language is a union of conjunctive queries based on REM or REE, we show
coNP-completeness.

perspective on understanding strong instrumental polarization effects for
planar low-frequency ""aperture arrays"" with the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA)
as an example. A long-standing issue that has been seen here is significant
instrumental Stokes leakage after calibration, particularly in Stokes Q at high
frequencies. A simple model that accounts for inter-element mutual coupling is
presented which explains the prominence of Q leakage seen when the array is
scanned away from zenith in the principal planes. On these planes, the model
predicts current imbalance in the X (E-W) and Y (N-S) dipoles and hence the Q
leakage. Although helpful in concept, we find that this model is inadequate to
explain the full details of the observation data. This finding motivates
further experimentation with more rigorous models that account for both mutual
coupling and embedded element patterns. Two more rigorous models are discussed:
the ""full"" and ""average"" embedded element patterns. The viability of the ""full""
model is demonstrated by simulating current MWA practice of using a Hertzian
dipole model as a Jones matrix estimate. We find that these results replicate
the observed Q leakage to approximately 2 to 5%. Finally, we offer more direct
indication for the level of improvement expected from upgrading the Jones
matrix estimate with more rigorous models. Using the ""average"" embedded pattern
as an estimate for the ""full"" model, we find that Q leakage of a few percent is
achievable.

MP for a dilute gas is close to the Chambadal-Novikov-Curzon-Ahlborn (CNCA)

between a gas particle and the piston, while (ii) the efficiency for a
moderately dense gas becomes smaller than the CNCA efficiency even when the

line of this strategy is to derive the equation and calculate the heavy quark

provide finally the heavy and N_f light quarks interaction term. As an example,
we derive heavy quark-light mesons interaction term for the N_f=2 case. If we

calculating the dispersion of surface mode of 2D-NRPhC as a function of surface

those terminations where surface mode is excited, that is, large inverse
Goos-Hanchen shift originates from backward surface mode of 2DNRPhC. In

estimated using spatial ecological studies, due to the recent widespread
availability of spatial referenced pollution and disease data. However, this
areal unit study design presents a number of statistical challenges, which if
ignored have the potential to bias the estimated pollution-health relationship.
One such challenge is how to control for the spatial autocorrelation present in
the data after accounting for the known covariates, which is caused by
unmeasured confounding. A second challenge is how to adjust the functional form
of the model to account for the spatial misalignment between the pollution and

program execution on multicore processors, thereby incurring significant
performance overhead. This paper presents a performance debugging framework,
PERFPLAY, to facilitate a comprehensive and in-depth understanding of the
performance impact of unnecessary lock contentions. The core technique of our
debugging framework is trace replay. Specifically, PERFPLAY records the program
execution trace, on the basis of which the unnecessary lock contentions can be
identified through trace analysis. We then propose a novel technique of trace
transformation to transform these identified unnecessary lock contentions in
the original trace into the correct pattern as a new trace free of unnecessary
lock contentions. Through replaying both traces, PERFPLAY can quantify the
performance impact of unnecessary lock contentions. To demonstrate the
effectiveness of our debugging framework, we study five real-world programs and
PARSEC benchmarks. Our experimental results demonstrate the significant
performance overhead of unnecessary lock contentions, and the effectiveness of
PERFPLAY in identifying the performance critical unnecessary lock contentions

entailment problem for classes of existential rules (also called

contribution is twofold. First, we introduce the class of greedy
bounded-treewidth sets (gbts) of rules, which covers guarded rules, and their
most well-known generalizations. We provide a generic algorithm for query
entailment under gbts, which is worst-case optimal for combined complexity with
or without bounded predicate arity, as well as for data complexity and query
complexity. Secondly, we classify several gbts classes, whose complexity was
unknown, with respect to combined complexity (with both unbounded and bounded
predicate arity) and data complexity to obtain a comprehensive picture of the
complexity of existential rule fragments that are based on diverse guardedness
notions. Upper bounds are provided by showing that the proposed algorithm is
optimal for all of them.

compressible Euler and Navier-Stokes equations. The main reason for the
feasibility to develop such a high-order scheme with compact stencil, which
involves only neighboring cells, is due to the use of a high-order gas
evolution model. Besides the evaluation of the time-dependent flux function
across a cell interface, the high-order gas evolution model also provides an
accurate time-dependent solution of the flow variables at a cell interface.
Therefore, the current scheme not only updates the cell averaged conservative
flow variables inside each control volume, but also tracks the flow variables
at the cell interface at the next time level. As a result, with both cell
averaged and cell interface values the high-order reconstruction in the current
scheme can be done compactly. Different from using a weak formulation for
high-order accuracy in the Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method, the current
scheme is based on the strong solution, where the flow evolution starting from
a piecewise discontinuous high-order initial data is precisely followed. The
cell interface time-dependent flow variables can be used for the initial data
reconstruction at the beginning of next time step. Even with compact stencil,
the current scheme has third-order accuracy in the smooth flow regions, and has
favorable shock capturing property in the discontinuous regions. Many test
cases are used to validate the current scheme. In comparison with many other
high-order schemes, the current method avoids the use of Gaussian points for
the flux evaluation along the cell interface and the multi-stage Runge-Kutta
time stepping technique.

attractive infinite-dimensional Hubbard models in the paramagnetic phase for a
generic band filling. The calculations are performed in a wide temperature
interval using the dynamical mean-field theory with the numerical
renormalization group as the impurity solver. The attractive case exhibits
significantly more complex temperature dependences which can be explained by
the behavior of the half-filled Hubbard model in external magnetic field with
constant magnetization, to which the attractive Hubbard model maps through the
partial particle-hole transformation. The resistivity is non-monotonous for
strongly attractive case: it peaks significantly above the MIR value at a
temperature $T_\mathrm{max}$ where the quasiparticle band disappears. For both
signs of $U$ we find particle-hole asymmetry in the self-energy at low
energies, but with the opposite kind of excitations having longer lifetime.
This leads to a strong suppression of the slope of the Seebeck coefficient in
the attractive case, rather than an enhancement as in the repulsive case. The
spin-lattice relaxation rate in the strongly attractive case has a
non-monotonic temperature dependence, thereby revealing the pairing
fluctuations.

applications in networking and operations research. In general, time-average
stochastic optimization can be solved by a Lyapunov optimization technique.
This paper shows that the technique exhibits a transient phase and a steady

convergence time can be improved. By starting the time average in the steady
state the convergence times become $O(1/\epsilon)$ under a locally-polyhedral

where $\epsilon$ denotes the proximity to the optimal objective cost.
Simulations suggest that the results may hold more generally without the unique

progressively flattens outwards, and that a nonthermal pressure component
amounting to ~20% of the total is required to support hydrostatic equilibrium
in the outskirts; there we also estimate a modest value C~1.6 of the ICM
clumping factor. These findings agree with previous analyses on other
cool-core, relaxed clusters, and lend further support to the picture by Lapi et
al. (2010) that relates the entropy flattening, the development of nonthermal
pressure component, and the azimuthal variation of ICM properties to weakening
boundary shocks. In this scenario clusters are born in a high-entropy state
throughout, and are expected to develop on similar timescales a low entropy
state both at the center due to cooling, and in the outskirts due to weakening
shocks. However, the analysis of J255 testifies how such a typical evolutionary
course can be interrupted or even reversed by merging especially at
intermediate redshift, as predicted by Cavaliere et al. (2011b). In fact, a
merger has rejuvenated the ICM of this cluster at z~0.45 by reestablishing a

since Gaussian-squared perturbations can yield a relatively large bispectrum,
satisfying the constraints from the power spectrum of CMB anisotropies, i.e.
$\mathcal{P}_\mathcal{SS}(k_0) \sim\mathcal{P}_g^2(k_0)\lesssim10^{-10}$ at
$k_0=0.05$ Mpc$^{-1}$. We also forecast constraints from the CMB temperature
and E-mode polarisation bispectra, and show that
$\mathcal{P}_g(k_0)\lesssim10^{-5}$ would be allowed from Planck data. We find
that $< \mu >$ and $|l(l+1)C^{\mu T}_l|$ can respectively be as large as
$10^{-9}$ and $10^{-14}$ with uncorrelated scale-invariant NID perturbations
for $\mathcal{P}_g(k_0)=10^{-5}$. When the spectrum of the Gaussian field is
blue-tilted (with spectral index $n_g \simeq 1.5$), $< \mu T>$ can be enhanced
by an order of magnitude.

outflow is launched via the radiation force from the super-critical accretion
flows around black holes. The angular size of the outflow, of which the radial
velocity (v_r) is over the escape velocity (v_esc), increases with an increase
of the distance from the black hole. As a result, the mass is blown away with
speed of v_r > v_esc in all direction except for the very vicinity of the
equatorial plane, theta=0-85^circ, where theta is the polar angle. The mass
ejected from the outer boundary per unit time by the outflow is larger than the
mass accretion rate onto the black hole, ~150L_Edd/c^2, where L_Edd and c are
the Eddington luminosity and the speed of light. Kinetic power of such
wide-angle high-velocity outflow is comparable to the photon luminosity and is
a few times larger than the Eddington luminosity. This corresponds to
~10^39-10^40 erg/s for the stellar mass black holes. Our model consistent with

propagation of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for pixelwise classification
on images. For pixelwise classification tasks, such as image segmentation and
object detection, surrounding image patches are fed into CNN for predicting the
classes of centered pixels via forward propagation and for updating CNN
parameters via backward propagation. However, forward and backward propagation
was originally designed for whole-image classification. Directly applying it to
pixelwise classification in a patch-by-patch scanning manner is extremely
inefficient, because surrounding patches of pixels have large overlaps, which
lead to a lot of redundant computation.
  The proposed algorithms eliminate all the redundant computation in
convolution and pooling on images by introducing novel d-regularly sparse
kernels. It generates exactly the same results as those by patch-by-patch
scanning. Convolution and pooling operations with such kernels are able to
continuously access memory and can run efficiently on GPUs. A fraction of
patches of interest can be chosen from each training image for backward

computation complexity is constant with respect to the number of patches

speed up commonly used patch-by-patch scanning over 1500 times in both forward

with known masses. On the other-hand, physically motivated models for
super-critical inflows can re-create the observed X-ray spectra and their

proposed to improve the throughput performance of wireless networks. With DOS,
each station contends for the channel with a certain access probability. If a
contention is successful, the station measures the channel conditions and
transmits in case the channel quality is above a certain threshold. Otherwise,
the station does not use the transmission opportunity, allowing all stations to
recontend. A key challenge with DOS is to design a distributed algorithm that
optimally adjusts the access probability and the threshold of each station. To
address this challenge, in this paper we first compute the configuration of
these two parameters that jointly optimizes throughput performance in terms of
proportional fairness. Then, we propose an adaptive algorithm based on control
theory that converges to the desired point of operation. Finally, we conduct a

(DSL) for tackling the issue of programming robots for small-sized batch
production. We observe that as the complexity of assembly increases so does the
likelihood of errors, and these errors need to be addressed. Nevertheless, it
is essential that programming and setting up the assembly remains fast, allows
quick changeovers, easy adjustments and reconfigurations. In this paper we
present an initial design and implementation of extending an existing DSL for
assembly operations with error specification, error handling and advanced move
commands incorporating error tolerance. The DSL is used as part of a framework
that aims at tackling uncertainties through a probabilistic approach.

of non-autonomous differential equations in the space, expressed in an
arbitrary matrix norm, are found. For equations with periodic coefficients, the
lower bound for the periods of ""oscillatory"" solutions is obtained. Similar
results are derived for a nonlinear periodic equation with zero equilibrium
position; in the autonomous case, they are valid for any periodic solution. All
the estimates are attained at a scalar equation and, thereby, are accurate for
any norm. The estimates are extended to equations with derivatives of any
order. Using the obtained results, a condition for the uniqueness of an
oscillatory solution is found; stability criteria for a linear Hamiltonian
system with periodic coefficients and for periodic solutions of a nonlinear
system (expressed through the period and any norm of the Hessian) are obtained.
Types of matrices and functions, for which the Euclidean norm has a minimum
value (and, therefore, provides the most accurate estimates for a specific
equation), are established.

glow discharge plasma is being reported. Initially the system is started at a
discharge voltage (DV) where it exhibited fixed point dynamics, and then with
the subsequent increase in the DV spikes were excited which were few in number
and with further increase of DV the number of spikes as well as their
regularity increased. The regularity in the interspike interval of the spikes
is estimated using normalized variance (NV). Coherence resonance was determined
using normalized variance curve and also corroborated by Hurst exponent and
power spectrum plots. We show that the regularity of the excitable spikes in
the floating potential fluctuation increases with the increase in the DV, upto
a particular value of DV. Using a Wiener filter, we separated the noise
component which was observed to increase with DV and hence conjectured that
noise can be playing an important role in the generation of the coherence
resonance. From an anharmonic oscillator equation describing ion acoustic
oscillations, we have been able to obtain a FHN like model which has been used
to understand the excitable dynamics of glow discharge plasma in the presence
of noise. The numerical results agree quite well with the experimental results.

nanoparticles of high refractive index, e.g., silicon, acting as a (passive)
cavity (without intrinsic gain) that is decorated with a thin film of organic
gain media. Its resonance frequencies can be tuned over the entire visible
range and bright and dark modes can be addressed. So called ""magnetic"" modes
can be utilized, which makes this dielectric nanolaser a complementary source
of coherent nearfields similar to the surface plasmon laser (which exploits
electric modes). The small intrinsic losses in silicon yield relatively high
quality factors and low non-radiative decay rates of emitters close to the
cavity, both of which will lead to low thresholds. As we show in this work, the
dielectric nanolaser exhibits certain advantages relative to nanowire lasers
and spasers, such as reduced laser threshold, short switch-on times, size and
design flexibility. The dielectric nanolaser is compatible with standard
lithographic fabrication approaches and its relative simple design may allow
for easy testing and realization of the concept. Thus, the silicon nanolaser
might soon find many applications in nanooptics and metamaterials.

referred to as 'Aggregate Risk Analysis' on the cloud. Parallel techniques to
improve efficiency and performance of the simulations are explored. Challenges
such as accommodating large input data on limited memory VMs and rapidly
processing data for real-time use are surmounted. The key result of this
investigation is that Aggregate Risk Analysis can be accommodated on cloud VMs.
Acceleration of up to 24x using multiple hardware accelerators over the
implementation on a single accelerator, 6x over a multiple core implementation
and approximately 60x over a baseline implementation was achieved on the cloud.
However, computational time is wasted for every dollar spent on the cloud due
to poor acceleration over multiple virtual cores. Interestingly, private VMs

birefringence will drop down at the fixed wavelength when the temperature

the requirement of semi-quantitative analysis with the radiotracer
concentration map of the breast, a new attenuation correction method based on
three-dimensional seeded region growing image segmentation (3DSRG-AC) solution
was developed. The method gives a 3D connected region as the segmentation
result instead of image slices. The continuously segmentation property makes
this new method free of activity variation of breast tissues. Threshold value
chosen is the key point for the segmentation process. The first valley of the
grey level histogram of the reconstruction image is set as the lower threshold,
which works fine in clinical application. Results show that attenuation
correction for PEMi improves the image quality and the quantitative accuracy of
radioactivity distribution determination. Attenuation correction also improves
the probabilities to detect small and early breast tumors.

RD model is reduced to an equation with no angular dependance. The model can be
further reduced by considering the birth function in the form of the Bessel

upon by a growing electrostatic wave, in the limit when the initial wave
amplitude is vanishingly small and when all the particles have the same initial
action, $I_0$. We show, both theoretically and numerically that, when all the
particles have been trapped in the wave potential, the distribution in action
exhibits a very sharp peak about the smallest action. Moreover, as the wave
keeps growing, the most probable action tends towards a constant, $I_f$, which
we estimate theoretically. In particular, we show that $I_f$ may be calculated
very accurately, when the particles' motion before trapping is far from
adiabatic, by making use of a perturbation analysis in the wave amplitude. This
fills a gap regarding the computation of the action change which, in the past,
has only been addressed for slowly varying dynamics. Moreover, when the
variations of the dynamics are fast enough, we show that the Fourier components
of the particles' distribution function can be calculated by connecting
estimates from our perturbation analysis with those obtained by assuming that
all the particles have the same constant action, $I=I_f$. This result is used
to compute theoretically the imaginary part of the electron susceptibility of
an electrostatic wave in a plasma. Moreover, using our formula for the electron
susceptibility, we can extend the range in $\epsilon_a$ (the parameter that
quantifies the slowness of the dynamics) for our perturbative estimate of
$I_f-I_0$. This range can actually be pushed down to values of $\epsilon_a$
allowing the use of neo-adiabatic techniques to compute the jump in action.
Hence, this paper shows that the action change due to trapping can be
calculated theoretically, whatever the rate of variation of the dynamics, by
connecting perturbative results with neo-adiabatic ones.

provided by nonthermal synchrotron radiation and we find that it allows to
reconcile the hot flow model with the AGN data. We take into account two
possible sources of nonthermal electrons. First, we consider e+- produced by
charged-pions decay, which should be always present in the innermost part of a
two-temperature flow due to proton-proton interactions. We find that for a weak
heating of thermal electrons (small delta) the synchrotron emission of
pion-decay e+- is much stronger than the thermal synchrotron emission in the

including hadronic effects in general agrees with the AGN data, except for the
case of a slowly rotating black hole and a thermal distribution of protons. For
large-delta, the pion-decay e+- have a negligible effect and then in this model

for future mobile communications, and one practical hurdle for its large scale
implementation is the stringent requirement of high capacity and low latency
fronthaul connecting the distributed remote radio heads (RRH) to the
centralized baseband pools (BBUs) in the C-RAN. To improve the scalability of
C-RAN networks, it is very important to take the fronthaul loading into
consideration in the signal detection, and it is very desirable to reduce the
fronthaul loading in C-RAN systems. In this paper, we consider uplink C-RAN
systems and we propose a distributed fronthaul compression scheme at the
distributed RRHs and a joint recovery algorithm at the BBUs by deploying the
techniques of distributed compressive sensing (CS). Different from conventional
distributed CS, the CS problem in C-RAN system needs to incorporate the
underlying effect of multi-access fading for the end-to-end recovery of the
transmitted signals from the users. We analyze the performance of the proposed
end-to-end signal recovery algorithm and we show that the aggregate measurement
matrix in C-RAN systems, which contains both the distributed fronthaul
compression and multiaccess fading, can still satisfy the restricted isometry
property with high probability. Based on these results, we derive tradeoff
results between the uplink capacity and the fronthaul loading in C-RAN systems.

scattered. In contrast, when the colloid is larger than a critical size it acts
as a passive trap: the swimmer is hydrodynamically captured along closed
trajectories and endlessly orbits around the colloidal sphere. In order to gain
physical insight into this hydrodynamic scattering problem, we address it
analytically. We provide expressions for the critical trapping radius, the
depth of the ""basin of attraction,"" and the scattering angle, which show
excellent agreement with our numerical findings. We also demonstrate and
rationalize the strong impact of swimming-flow symmetries on the trapping
efficiency. Finally, we give the swimmer an opportunity to escape the colloidal
traps by considering the effects of Brownian, or active, diffusion. We show
that in some cases the trapping time is governed by an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck
process, which results in a trapping time distribution that is
well-approximated as inverse-Gaussian. The predictions again compare very
favorably with the numerical simulations. We envision applications of the
theory to bioremediation, microorganism sorting techniques, and the study of
bacterial populations in heterogeneous or porous environments.

consists of two components - a thermal component associated with emission from
the neutron star surface, and a non-thermal power-law component whose origin is
not well understood. Spectral fitting of neutron star atmosphere models to the
thermal component is one of the leading methods for measuring the neutron star
radius. However, it has been known for years that the X-ray spectra of
quiescent neutron stars vary between observations. While most quiescent
variability is explained through a variable power-law component, the brightest
and best-studied object, Cen X-4, requires a change in the thermal component
and such thermal variability could be a problem for measuring neutron star
radii. In this paper, we significantly increase the number of sources whose
quiescent spectra have been studied for variability. We examine 9 potential
quiescent neutron stars with luminosities <1E34 erg/s over the course of
multiple Chandra observations of the globular clusters NGC 6440 and Terzan 5
and find no strong evidence for variability in the effective temperature in 7
of the 9 sources. Two sources show a potential change in temperature, though
this depends on the exact model fitted. CX1 in NGC 6440 is equally well fit by
a variable thermal component or a variable power law. Therefore, the results
are inconclusive and we cannot exclude or require thermal variability in that
source. CX5 in NGC 6440 shows a potential change in temperature, though this
depends on whether a power-law is included in the spectral fit or not. This
suggests that thermal variability may not be widespread among quiescent neutron
stars with luminosities < 1E34 erg/s, and hence thermal radiation remains a
promising means to constraining neutron star radii.

than for single stars in the same T$_\mathrm{eff}$ region, suggesting that
rotationally-induced mixing (and not the presence of planets) might be the
cause for a greater depletion of Li. We confirm that the mass-metallicity
dependence of the Li dip is extended towards [Fe/H] $\sim$ 0.4 dex (beginning
at [Fe/H] $\sim$ -0.4 dex for our stars) and that probably reflects the
mass-metallicity correlation of stars of the same T$_\mathrm{eff}$ on the Main
Sequence. We find that for the youngest stars ($<$ 1.5 Gyr) around the Li dip,
the depletion of Li increases with v \textit{sin}i values, as proposed by
rotationally-induced depletion models. This suggests that the Li dip consists
of fast rotators at young ages whereas the most Li-depleted old stars show
lower rotation rates (probably caused by the spin-down during their long
lifes). We have also explored the Li evolution with [Fe/H] taking advantage of
the metal-rich stars included in our sample. We find that Li abundance reaches

Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and limit image distortions due to long echo

be taken into account to collect a sufficient amount of samples in a minimal
amount of time. However, sampling strategies (e.g., Compressed Sensing) and
optimal gradient waveform design have been developed separately so far. The
major flaw of existing methods is that they do not take the sampling density
into account, the latter being central in sampling theory. In particular,
methods using optimal control tend to agglutinate samples in high curvature
areas. In this paper, we develop an iterative algorithm to project any
parameterization of k-space trajectories onto the set of feasible curves that

provides a more efficient alternative than existinf approaches and that it can
be a way of reducing acquisition time while maintaining sampling density for

However, MDS matrices cannot be sparse and usually have a large description,

to solve this problem by focusing on MDS matrices that can be computed as a
power of a simple companion matrix, thus having a compact description suitable
even for constrained environ- ments. However, up to now, finding recursive MDS

Unfortunately, not all recursive MDS matrices can be obtained from BCH codes,

to conclude that the relative inclination between the inner and outer disks is
70+-5 deg. This finding taps the potential of high-contrast imaging of
circumstellar disks, and bears consequences on the gas dynamics of gapped
disks, as well as on the physical conditions in the shadowed regions.

environment can become a resource for the generation and protection of quantum
states. This notion can be generalized to the confinement of a system into a
manifold of quantum states, consisting of all coherent superpositions of
multiple stable steady states. We have experimentally confined the state of a
harmonic oscillator to the quantum manifold spanned by two coherent states of
opposite phases. In particular, we have observed a Schrodinger cat state
spontaneously squeeze out of vacuum, before decaying into a classical mixture.
This was accomplished by designing a superconducting microwave resonator whose
coupling to a cold bath is dominated by photon pair exchange. This experiment

and K type giants at Lick Observatory regularly over more than 12 years.
Planets have been identified around 15 giant stars; an additional 20 giant
stars host planet candidates. We investigate the occurrence rate of substellar
companions around giant stars as a function of stellar mass and metallicity. We
probe the stellar mass range from about 1 to beyond 3 M_Sun, which is not being
explored by main-sequence samples. We fit the giant planet occurrence rate as a
function of stellar mass and metallicity with a Gaussian and an exponential
distribution, respectively. We find strong evidence for a planet-metallicity
correlation among the secure planet hosts of our giant star sample, in
agreement with the one for main-sequence stars. However, the planet-metallicity
correlation is absent for our sample of planet candidates, raising the
suspicion that a good fraction of them might indeed not be planets. Consistent
with the results obtained by Johnson for subgiants, the giant planet occurrence
rate increases in the stellar mass interval from 1 to 1.9 M_Sun. However, there
is a maximum at a stellar mass of 1.9 +0.1/-0.5 M_Sun, and the occurrence rate
drops rapidly for masses larger than 2.5-3.0 M_Sun. We do not find any planets
around stars more massive than 2.7 M_Sun, although there are 113 stars with
masses between 2.7 and 5 M_Sun in our sample (corresponding to a giant planet
occurrence rate < 1.6% at 68.3% confidence in that stellar mass bin). We also
show that this result is not a selection effect related to the planet
detectability being a function of the stellar mass. We conclude that giant
planet formation or inward migration is suppressed around higher mass stars,
possibly because of faster disk depletion coupled with a longer migration
timescale.

line velocity profile is different in the three datasets: in the first epoch

consistent with the gas being in Keplerian rotation around the star. No OH
emission is detected within a radius of 8-11 au from the star: the line
emitting region is similar in size and extent to that of the CO ro-vibrational

taken by previous authors as evidence for tidal interaction between an (unseen)
massive planet and the disk. We show that the observed asymmetries can be fully
explained by a misalignment of the slit of order 0\farcs04-0\farcs20 with
respect to the stellar position. The disk is spatially resolved and the slit
misalignment is likely caused by the extended dust emission which is brighter
than the stellar photosphere at near-infrared wavelengths which is the
wavelength used for the pointing. This can cause the photo-center of HD 100546

that it is profitable to send packets on via the lowest latency mechanism

forwarding engines compete to solve a time-locked puzzle that can be claimed by
the node that delivers the result in the lowest latency. This approach
naturally extends congestion control techniques to a surge pricing model when

double-power law family of densities often used to model galaxies. The DF
itself is a double-power law in combinations of the actions, and reduces to the
known limits in the case of a pure power-law at small and large radii. Our
method enables the velocity anisotropy of the model to be tuned, and so the
anisotropy in the inner and outer parts can be specified for the application in
hand. We provide self-consistent DFs for the Hernquist and Jaffe models - both
with everywhere isotropic velocity dispersions, and with kinematics that
gradually becomes more radially anisotropic on moving outwards. We also carry
out this exercise for a cored dark-matter model. These are tailored to
represent dark haloes and elliptical galaxies respectively with kinematic
properties inferred from simulations or observational data. Finally, we relax a
cored luminous component within a dark matter halo to provide a self-consistent
model of a dwarf spheroidal embedded in dark matter. The DFs provide us with
non-rotating spherical stellar systems, but one of the virtues of working with
actions is the relative ease with which such models can be converted into
axisymmetry and triaxiality.

includes results on the structure and transfer of packets of limits of discrete
series representations. It also reinterprets the Adams-Johnson transfer of
certain nontempered representations via spectral analogues of the
Langlands-Shelstad factors, thereby providing structure and transfer compatible
with the associated transfer of orbital integrals. The results come from two
simple tools introduced here. The first concerns a family of splittings of the
algebraic group G under consideration; such a splitting is based on a
fundamental maximal torus of G rather than a maximally split maximal torus. The
second concerns a family of Levi groups attached to the dual data of a
Langlands or an Arthur parameter for the group G. The introduced splittings
provide explicit realizations of these Levi groups. The tools also apply to
maps on stable conjugacy classes associated with the transfer of orbital
integrals. In particular, they allow for a simpler version of the definitions
of Kottwitz-Shelstad for twisted endoscopic transfer in certain critical cases.
The paper prepares for spectral factors in twisted endoscopic transfer that are
compatible in a certain sense with the standard factors discussed here. This
compatibility is needed for Arthur's global theory. The twisted factors
themselves will be defined in a separate paper.

associated with resonance induced by the Galactic bar, since it is extended in

rules for data display. Each CSS rule consists of a node selector (given in an
XPath-like query language) and a declaration block (assigning values to
selected nodes' display attributes). As web applications evolve, maintaining
CSS files can easily become problematic. Some CSS rules will be replaced by new
ones, but these obsolete (hence redundant) CSS rules often remain in the

significantly increases web browsers' processing time. Most works on detecting
redundant CSS rules in HTML5 applications do not consider the dynamic behaviors
of HTML5 (specified in JavaScript); in fact, the only proposed method that
takes these into account is dynamic analysis (a.k.a. testing), which cannot
soundly prove redundancy of CSS rules. In this paper, we introduce an
abstraction of HTML5 applications based on monotonic tree-rewriting and study
its ""redundancy problem"". We establish the precise complexity of the problem

particular, our algorithm relies on an efficient reduction to an analysis of
symbolic pushdown systems (for which highly optimised solvers are available),
which yields a fast method for checking redundancy in practice. We implemented

  invalidating Theorem 1",,,,"cs.LO cs.FL cs.GT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Parity games are an expressive framework to consider realizability questions
for omega-regular languages. However, it is open whether they can be solved in
polynomial time, making them unamenable for practical usage. To overcome this
restriction, we consider 3-color parity games, which can be solved in
polynomial time. They still cover an expressive fragment of specifications, as
they include the classical B\""uchi and co-B\""uchi winning conditions as well as
their union and intersection. This already suffices to express many useful
combinations of safety and liveness properties, as for example the family of
GR(1). The best known algorithm for 3-color parity games solves a game with n
vertices in $ O(n^{2}\sqrt{n}) $ time. We improve on this result by presenting
a new algorithm, based on simple attractor constructions, which only needs time
$ O(n^2) $. As a result, we match the best known running times for solving
(co)-B\""uchi games, showing that 3-color parity games are not harder to solve
in general.

that: given a strictly convex body $K\subset\mathbb{R}^{3}$ with smooth

\mathbb{RP}^3$ combinatorially equivalent to $P$ which midscribes $K$. Here the

the authors prove a rigidity result concerning this theorem as well. Namely,
such a polyhedron is unique under certain normalization conditions.

any element of the Galois group of a cyclic algebraic extension of a base

rational functions using algebraic function fields with a cyclic Galois group.
This gives a linear subspace of matrices whose coefficients are rational
function, such that the rank of each of this matrix is lower bounded, where the
rank is comprised in term of linear combination with rational functions. We
provide two examples based on Kummer and Artin-Schreier extensions.The matrices
