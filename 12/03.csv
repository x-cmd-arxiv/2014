from different perspectives, such that users have the possibility to select
their preferred viewpoint. This results in large amounts of highly redundant
data, which needs to be properly handled during encoding and transmission over
resource-constrained channels. In this work, we study coding and transmission
strategies in multicamera systems, where correlated sources send data through a
bottleneck channel to a central server, which eventually transmits views to
different interactive users. We propose a dynamic correlation-aware packet
scheduling optimization under delay, bandwidth, and interactivity constraints.
The optimization relies both on a novel rate-distortion model, which captures
the importance of each view in the 3D scene reconstruction, and on an objective
function that optimizes resources based on a client navigation model. The
latter takes into account the distortion experienced by interactive clients as
well as the distortion variations that might be observed by clients during
multiview navigation. We solve the scheduling problem with a novel
trellis-based solution, which permits to formally decompose the multivariate
optimization problem thereby significantly reducing the computation complexity.
Simulation results show the gain of the proposed algorithm compared to baseline
scheduling policies. More in details, we show the gain offered by our dynamic
scheduling policy compared to static camera allocation strategies and to
schemes with constant coding strategies. Finally, we show that the best
scheduling policy consistently adapts to the most likely user navigation path
and that it minimizes distortion variations that can be very disturbing for
users in traditional navigation systems.

  publication",,,,"cs.CG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The SINR model for wireless networks has been extensively studied recently.
It tries to model whether a particular transmitter is heard at a specific
location, with $n$ transmitting simultaneously. The SINR diagram consists of
$n$ regions where each transmitter can be heard and the remaining space where
no one can be heard.
  Efficient point location in the SINR diagram, i.e., building a data structure
to determine, for a query point, whether any transmitter is heard there, and if
so, which one, has been recently investigated. Previous such planar data
structures are constructed in time at least quadratic in $n$ and support
logarithmic-time approximate queries. Moreover, the performance of these
depends not only on the number $n$ of transmitters and on the approximation
parameter $\varepsilon$, but also on some geometric parameters that cannot be
bounded a priori as a function of $n$ or $\varepsilon$.
  We address the question of batched point location queries, i.e., answering
many queries simultaneously. Specifically, in one dimension, we can answer $n$
queries exactly in amortized polylogarithmic time per query, while in the plane
we can do it approximately.
  All these results can handle arbitrary power assignments to the transmitters.
Moreover, the amortized query time in these results depends only on $n$ and
$\varepsilon$.
  We also show how to speed up the preprocessing in a previously proposed
point-location structure in SINR diagram for uniform-power sites, by almost a
full order of magnitude. For this we obtain results on the sensitivity of the
reception regions to slight changes in the reception threshold, which are of
independent interest.
  Finally, these results demonstrate the (so far underutilized) power of
combining algebraic tools with those of computational geometry and other
fields.

approach for partial wetting and drying within grid cells, eschewing the
conventional hydrodynamic modeling method by nesting a sub-grid containing
high-resolution lidar topography and fine scale bathymetry within each
computational grid cell. In doing so, the sub-grid modeling method is heavily
dependent on building and street configuration provided by the DEM. The results
of spatial comparisons between the sub-grid model and FEMA's maximum inundation
extents in New York City yielded an unparalleled absolute mean distance
difference of 38m and an average of 75% areal spatial match. An in-depth error
analysis reveals that the modeled extent contour is well correlated with the
FEMA extent contour in most areas, except in several distinct areas where
differences in special features cause significant de-correlations between the
two contours. Examples of these errors were found to be primarily attributed to
lack of building representation in the New Jersey region of the model grid,
occluded highway underpasses artificially blocking fluid flow, and DEM source
differences between the model and FEMA. Accurate representation of these urban
infrastructural features is critical in terms of sub-grid modeling, because it
uniquely affects the fluid flux through each grid cell side, which ultimately
determines the water depth and extent of flooding via distribution of water
volume within each grid cell. Incorporation of buildings and highway
underpasses allow for the model to improve overall absolute mean distance error
metrics from 38m to 32m and area comparisons from 75% spatial match to 80% with
minimal additional effort.

reliant on information on key epidemiological quantities, such as transmission
potential and serial interval. Increasingly, transmission models fit to

widely-used modeling practices lead to potentially large errors in parameter
estimates and, consequently, errors in model-based forecasts. Even more
worryingly, in such situations, confidence in parameter estimates and forecasts
can itself be far over-estimated, leading to the potential for large errors
that mask their own presence. Fortunately, straightforward and computationally
inexpensive alternatives exist that avoid these problems. Here, we first use a
simulation study to demonstrate potential pitfalls of the standard practice of
fitting deterministic models to cumulative incidence data. Next, we demonstrate
an alternative based on stochastic models fit to raw data from an early phase
of 2014 West Africa Ebola Virus Disease outbreak. We show not only that bias is
thereby reduced, but that uncertainty in estimates and forecasts is better
quantified and that, critically, lack of model fit is more readily diagnosed.

the following; it was stated by Papadimitriou in 2007: find a non-symmetric
Nash equilibrium (NE) in a symmetric game. We show that this problem is
NP-complete and the problem of counting the number of non-symmetric NE in a
symmetric game is #P-complete.

represented by matrices (A, B) to be rank(A+B) and asked whether a NE can be
computed in rank 1 games in polynomial time. Observe that the rank 0 case is
precisely the zero sum case, for which a polynomial time algorithm follows from
von Neumann's reduction of such games to linear programming. In 2011, Adsul et.

models derived from an analysis of minimum bias $p$+A interactions. In general,
these models assume that hard process rates and the magnitude of the soft event
activity in the underlying $NN$ collisions is uncorrelated. When included,
these correlations influence the measured yield in a nominal centrality
interval, an effect typically referred to as a ""centrality bias"". In this work,
the impact of a positive correlation between the hard scattering yield and the
underlying event activity in individual $NN$ collisions is investigated. This
correlation is incorporated into the centrality calculations used by ATLAS and
PHENIX, both based on a similar Monte Carlo Glauber approach but with different
models of the per-collision or per-participant event activity. It is found that
the presence of this correlation tends to increase the yield measured in more
central events and decrease it in peripheral events. Numerical factors to
correct measured yields for the centrality bias effect are calculated for $p$+A
collisions at RHIC and the LHC. Reasonable agreement with a previous
calculation of these factors by PHENIX is found, despite differences in the

the interrogation time in microwave clocks. To mitigate the perturbing effects
of the magnetic trap, near-magic-field configurations are employed, where the
involved clock transition becomes independent of the atom's potential energy to
first order. Still, higher order effects are a dominating source for dephasing,
limiting the performance of this approach. Here we propose a simple method to
cancel the energy dependence to both first and second order, using weak
radio-frequency dressing. We give values for dressing frequencies, amplitudes,
and trapping fields for 87Rb atoms and investigate quantitatively the
robustness of these second-order-magic conditions to variations of the system
parameters. We conclude that radio-frequency dressing can suppress
field-induced dephasing by at least one order of magnitude for typical
experimental parameters

spacetime is locally Minkowskian. However, due to the conformal nature of the
Robertson-Walker metric the conventional transformation to the local inertial
coordinates introduces ambiguity in the physical interpretation of the local
time coordinate. Therefore, contrary to a common-sense expectation, a
straightforward implementation of EEP alone does not allow us to decide whether
atomic clocks ticks at the same rate as the clocks based on EM modes of a
cavity. To resolve the ambiguity we analyzed the cavity rigidity and the
oscillation of its EM modes in an expanding universe by employing the Maxwell
equations. We found out that both the size of the cavity and the EM frequency
experience an adiabatic drift in conformal coordinates as the universe expands.
We set up the oscillation equation for the EM modes, solve it by the WKB
approximation, and reduce the coordinate-dependent quantities to their
counterparts measured by a local observer who counts time with atomic clock.
The solution shows that there is a perfect cancellation of the adiabatic drift
of cavity's frequency by the transformation to local coordinates, and the time
counted by the clocks based on EM modes of cavity has the same rate as that of
atomic clocks. We conclude that there should be no cosmological drift of
frequency of a standing EM wave oscillating in the cavity resonator as compared
to the frequency of atomic clocks. Continuous comparison of the frequency of
the optical cavity resonator against that of atomic clock yields a powerful
null test of the local isotropy of the Hubble expansion and the Einstein
equivalence principle in cosmology.

regulations are common in cellular regulatory networks. They consist of two
genes, encoding a transcription factor and a small non-coding RNA (sRNA), which
mutually regulate each other's expression. We present a theoretical and
numerical study of coherent mixed feedback loops of this type, in which both
regulations are negative. Under suitable conditions, these feedback loops are
expected to exhibit bistability, namely two stable states, one dominated by the
transcriptional repressor and the other dominated by the sRNA. We use
deterministic methods based on rate equation models, in order to identify the
range of parameters in which bistability takes place. However, the
deterministic models do not account for the finite lifetimes of the bistable
states and the spontaneous, fluctuation-driven transitions between them.
Therefore, we use stochastic methods to calculate the average lifetimes of the
two states. It is found that these lifetimes strongly depend on rate
coefficients such as the transcription rates of the transcriptional repressor
and the sRNA. In particular, we show that the fraction of time the system
spends in the sRNA dominated state follows a monotonically decreasing sigmoid
function of the transcriptional repressor transcription rate. The biological
relevance of these results is discussed in the context of such mixed feedback
loops in {\it Escherichia coli}.

the PN barrier for strongly localized solutions becomes large, rendering these
essentially immobile. Several ways to improve the mobility by reducing the
PN-barrier have been proposed during the last decade, and the first part gives
a brief review of such scenarios in 1D and 2D. We then proceed to discuss two
recently discovered novel mobility scenarios. The first example is the 2D
Kagome lattice, where the existence of a highly degenerate, flat linear band
allows for a very small PN-barrier and mobility of highly localized modes in a
small-power regime. The second example is a 1D waveguide array in an active
medium with intrinsic (saturable) gain and damping, where exponentially
localized, travelling discrete dissipative solitons may exist as stable
attractors. Finally, using the framework of an extended Bose-Hubbard model, we
show that while quantum fluctuations destroy the mobility of slowly moving,
strongly localized classical modes, coherent mobility of rapidly moving states
survives even in a strongly quantum regime.

occasions under sample rotation where evolution of samples in time is designed
through a cascade pattern. It has been known since the seminal paper of
Patterson (1950) that when the units are not allowed to return to the sample
after leaving it for certain period (there are no gaps in the rotation
pattern), one step recursion for optimal estimator holds. However, in some
important real surveys, e.g. Current Population Survey in the US or Labour
Force Survey in many countries in Europe, units return to the sample after
being absent in the sample for several occasions (there are gaps in rotation
patterns). In such situations difficulty of the question of the form of the
recurrence for optimal estimator increases drastically. This issue has not been
resolved yet. Instead alternative sub-optimal approaches were developed, as
K-composite estimation (see e.g. Hansen et al. (1955)), AK-composite estimation
(see e.g. Gurney and Daly (1965) or time series approach (see e.g. Binder and
Hidiroglou (1988)).

present analytical recursion formulas for the optimal linear estimator of the
mean for schemes with gaps in rotation patterns. It is achieved under some
technical conditions: ASSUMPTION I and ASSUMPTION II (numerical experiments
suggest that these assumptions might be universally satisfied). To attain the
goal we develop an algebraic operator approach which allows to reduce the
problem of recursion for the optimal linear estimator to two issues: (1)
localization of roots (possibly complex) of a polynomial Q_p defined in terms
of the rotation pattern (Q_p happens to be conveniently expressed through
Chebyshev polynomials of the first kind), (2) rank of a matrix S defined in

on recent progress on this problem, we consider the analogous problem over
quadratic number fields. We first construct high-density subsets of the
algebraic integers of an imaginary quadratic number field that avoid 3-term
geometric progressions. When unique factorization fails or over a real
quadratic number field, we instead look at subsets of ideals of the ring of
integers. Our approach here is to construct sets ""greedily,"" a generalization
of the greedy set of rational integers considered by Rankin. We then describe
the densities of these sets in terms of values of the Dedekind zeta function.
Next, we consider geometric-progression-free sets with large upper density. We
generalize an argument by Riddell to obtain upper bounds for the upper density
of geometric-progression-free subsets, and construct sets avoiding geometric
progressions with high upper density to obtain lower bounds for the supremum of
the upper density of all such subsets. Both arguments depend critically on the
elements with small norm in the ring of integers.

a constant fraction $q$ of the points moves freely in the whole plane; the
remaining fraction is constrained to move on fixed lines called sliders. When
does a giant rigid cluster emerge? Under a genericity condition, the answer
only depends on the graph formed by the points (vertices) and the bars (edges).
We find for the random graph $G \in \mathcal{G}(n,c/n)$ the threshold value of
$c$ for the appearance of a linear-sized rigid component as a function of $q$,
generalizing results of Kasiviswanathan et al. We show that this appearance of
a giant component undergoes a continuous transition for $q \leq 1/2$ and a
discontinuous transition for $q > 1/2$. In our proofs, we introduce a

2-orientability, of cores interpolating between 2-core and 3-core, and of
extended cores interpolating between 2+1-core and 3+2-core; we find the precise

reaction networks are the finite difference (FD), the Girsanov transformation
(GT) and the regularized pathwise derivative (RPD) methods. It has been
numerically observed in the literature, that the biased FD and RPD methods tend
to have lower variance than the unbiased GT method and that centering the GT
method (CGT) reduces its variance. We provide a theoretical justification for
these observations in terms of system size asymptotic analysis under what is
known as the classical scaling. Our analysis applies to GT, CGT and FD, and
shows that the standard deviations of their estimators when normalized by the
actual sensitivity, scale as $\mathcal{O}(N^{1/2}), \mathcal{O}(1)$ and
$\mathcal{O}(N^{-1/2})$ respectively, as system size $N \to \infty$. In the
case of the FD methods, the $N \to \infty$ asymptotics are obtained keeping the
finite difference perturbation $h$ fixed. Our numerical examples verify that
our order estimates are sharp and that the variance of the RPD method scales
similarly to the FD methods. We combine our large $N$ asymptotics with
previously known small $h$ asymptotics to obtain the best choice of $h$ in
terms of $N$, and estimate the number $N_s$ of simulations required to achieve
a prescribed relative $\mathcal{L}_2$ error $\delta$. This shows that $N_s$
depends on $\delta$ and $N$ as $\delta^{-2 - \frac{\gamma_2}{\gamma_1}} N^{-1},
\delta^{-2}$ and $N \delta^{-2}$, for FD, CGT and GT respectively. Here
$\gamma_1 >0, \gamma_2>0$ depend on the type of FD method used.

cooperative relationship between antiferromagnetic spin correlations and

charge-density-wave (CDW) order competes for Fermi surface area with
superconductivity. La$_{2-x}$Ba$_x$CuO$_4$ with $x=0.125$ provides an example
in which the ordering of spin stripes coincides with the onset of
two-dimensional superconducting correlations. The apparent frustration of the
interlayer Josephson coupling has motivated the concept of the
pair-density-wave superconductor, a state that theoretical calculations show to
be energetically competitive with the uniform $d$-wave superconductor. Even at
$x=0.095$, where there is robust superconductivity below 32~K in zero field,
the coexistence of strong, low-energy, incommensurate spin excitations implies
a spatially modulated and intertwined pair wave function. Recent observations
of CDW order in YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{6+x}$ and other cuprate families have raised
interesting questions regarding the general role of charge modulations and the
relation to superconductivity. While there are differences in the doping
dependence of the modulation wave vectors in YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{6+x}$ and
La$_{2-x}$Ba$_x$CuO$_4$, the maximum ordering strength is peaked at the hole
concentration of 1/8 in both cases. There are also possible connections with

we infer an observed temperature $kT =(324\pm33)$ keV of the $e^+e^-$-plasma at

burst energy $E^{tot}_{e^+e^-}=(6.03\pm0.79)\times10^{52}$ erg, a rest-frame
peak energy $E_{p,i}=4.7$ MeV, and a baryon load
$B=(5.52\pm0.73)\times10^{-5}$. We also estimate the corresponding emission of
gravitational waves. Two additional examples of family-2 short bursts are
identified: GRB 081024B and GRB 090510, remarkable for its well determined
cosmological distance. We show that marked differences exist in the nature of
the afterglows of these two families of short bursts: family-2 bursts, leading
to BH formation, consistently exhibit high energy emission following the P-GRB
emission; family-1 bursts, leading to the formation of a massive NS, should
never exhibit high energy emission. We also show that both the families fulfill
an $E_{p,i}$--$E_{iso}$ relation with slope $\gamma=0.59\pm0.07$ and a
normalization constant incompatible with the one for long GRBs. The observed
rate of such family-2 events is
$\rho_0=\left(2.1^{+2.8}_{-1.4}\right)\times10^{-4}$Gpc$^{-3}$yr$^{-1}$.

develop more granular identifiers to track taxonomic congruence and

logically represent taxonomic provenance across multiple classification

for two classifications of primates corresponding to the second and third MSW

usages as taxonomic concepts, (2) articulation of concepts via human-asserted
Region Connection Calculus (RCC-5) relationships, and (3) the use of an Answer
Set Programming toolkit to infer and visualize logically consistent alignments
of these taxonomic input constraints. Our use case entails the Primates sec.
Groves (1993; MSW2 - 317 taxonomic concepts; 233 at the species level) and
Primates sec. Groves (2005; MSW3 - 483 taxonomic concepts; 376 at the species

yields a single, consistent alignment, and infers 153,111 Maximally Informative

partitions facilitate quantitative analyses of name/meaning dissociation,
revealing that approximately one in three paired name usages across treatments

X-ray Telescope (XRT), high-energy gamma-ray observations with the Fermi Large

VERITAS above 315 GeV, all taken between 17 April 2012 and 1 June 2012 (MJD
56034 and 56079). The contemporaneous variability of the broadband spectral
energy distribution is explored in the context of a simple synchrotron self
Compton (SSC) model. In the SSC emission scenario, we find that the parameters
required to represent the high state are significantly different than those in
the low state. Motivated by possible evidence of gas in the vicinity of the
blazar, we also investigate a reflected-emission model to describe the observed
variability pattern. This model assumes that the non-thermal emission from the
jet is reflected by a nearby cloud of gas, allowing the reflected emission to
re-enter the blob and produce an elevated gamma-ray state with no simultaneous
elevated synchrotron flux. The model applied here, although not required to
explain the observed variability pattern, represents one possible scenario
which can describe the observations. As applied to an elevated VHE state of 66%
of the Crab Nebula flux, observed on a single night during the observation
period, the reflected-emission scenario does not support a purely leptonic
non-thermal emission mechanism. The reflected emission model does, however,
predict a reflected photon field with sufficient energy to enable elevated
gamma-ray emission via pion production with protons of energies between 10 and
100 TeV.

  Scoring System",,,,,"stat.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Recording of events in National Hockey League rinks is done through the Real
Time Scoring System. This system records events such as hits, shots, faceoffs,
etc., as part of the play-by-play files that are made publicly available.
Several previous studies have found that there are inconsistencies in the
recording of these events from rink to rink. In this paper, we propose a
methodology for estimation of the rink effects for each of the rinks in the
National Hockey League. Our aim is to build a model which accounts for the
relative differences between rinks. We use log-linear regression to model
counts of events per game with several predictors including team factors and
average score differential. The estimated rink effects can be used to reweight
recorded events so that can have comparable counts of events across rinks.
Applying our methodology to data from six regular seasons, we find that there
are some rinks with rink effects that are significant and consistent across
these seasons for multiple events.

experimental chaotic map that arise due to discontinuities in the map. The
chaos is realized in an autonomous Boolean network which is constructed using
asynchronous logic gates to form a map operator that outputs an unclocked
pulse-train of varying widths. The map operator executes pulse-width stretching
and folding and the operator's output is fed back to its input to continuously
iterate the map. Using a simple model, we show that the structured
scale-dependence in the system's Lyapunov exponent is the result of the
discrete logic elements in the map operator's stretching function.

dual of the trace of the $\beta$-power of the time evolution operator when
$\beta\in \mathbb{R}$. This will be done perturbatively by using a weakly time
dependent Hamiltonian, corresponding to a small shift of the dual static
background. Depending on the periodicity we impose on the gravitational
solution, we consider two different possibilities and compare the associated
entropies with the results obtained through a minimal area computation. To our
surprise we discover that, at first order, both choices correctly reproduce the
associated entanglement entropy. Furthermore we find unexpected divergent
contributions that we have to discard in order to fit the minimal area
computation, and an additional requirement that needs to be imposed on the
$\beta$ dependence on the metric.

dynamical chiral symmetry breaking and restoration in quark matter. Based on a
generalized Beth-Uhlenbeck approach to mesons and diquarks we present the
thermodynamics of this system including the Mott dissociation of mesons and
diquarks at finite temperature. A striking result is the suppression of the
diquark abundance below the chiral restoration temperature by the coupling to
the Polyakov loop, because of their color degree of freedom. This is understood
in close analogy to the suppression of quark distributions by the same
mechanism. Mesons as color singlets are unaffected by the Polyakov-loop
suppression. At temperatures above the chiral restoration mesons and diquarks
are both suppressed due to the Mott effect, whereby the positive resonance
contribution to the pressure is largely compensated by the negative scattering
contribution in accordance with the Levinson theorem.

and identified charged hadrons in Au$+$Au and Cu$+$Cu collisions on collision
energy, species, and centrality. The values of $v_2$ as a function of
transverse momentum $p_T$ and centrality in Au$+$Au collisions at
$\sqrt{s_{_{NN}}}$=200 GeV and 62.4 GeV are the same within uncertainties.
However, in Cu$+$Cu collisions we observe a decrease in $v_2$ values as the
collision energy is reduced from 200 to 62.4 GeV. The decrease is larger in the
more peripheral collisions. By examining both Au$+$Au and Cu$+$Cu collisions we
find that $v_2$ depends both on eccentricity and the number of participants,
$N_{\rm part}$. We observe that $v_2$ divided by eccentricity ($\varepsilon$)
monotonically increases with $N_{\rm part}$ and scales as ${N_{\rm
part}^{1/3}}$. The Cu$+$Cu data at 62.4 GeV falls below the other scaled
$v_{2}$ data. For identified hadrons, $v_2$ divided by the number of
constituent quarks $n_q$ is independent of hadron species as a function of
transverse kinetic energy $KE_T=m_T-m$ between $0.1<KE_T/n_q<1$ GeV. Combining
all of the above scaling and normalizations, we observe a near-universal
scaling, with the exception of the Cu$+$Cu data at 62.4 GeV, of

Special attention is payed to the transition from the high energy quark-gluon

within a functional renormalisation group approach to QCD amended by dynamical
hadronisation techniques. The latter allow us to describe conveniently the
transition from the perturbative high-energy regime to the nonperturbative
low-energy limit without suffering from a fine-tuning of model parameters. In
the present work, we apply these techniques to two-flavour QCD with physical

$P$ in spatial coordinates. These ""polynomial shift symmetries"" in turn protect
the technical naturalness of modes with a higher-order dispersion relation, and
lead to a refinement of the proposed classification of infrared Gaussian fixed
points available to describe NG modes in nonrelativistic theories. Generic
interactions in such theories break the polynomial shift symmetry explicitly to
the constant shift. It is thus natural to ask: Given a Gaussian fixed point
with polynomial shift symmetry of degree $P$, what are the lowest-dimension
operators that preserve this symmetry, and deform the theory into a
self-interacting scalar field theory with the shift symmetry of degree $P$? To
answer this (essentially cohomological) question, we develop a new
graph-theoretical technique, and use it to prove several classification
theorems. First, in the special case of $P=1$ (essentially equivalent to
Galileons), we reproduce the known Galileon $N$-point invariants, and find
their novel interpretation in terms of graph theory, as an equal-weight sum
over all labeled trees with $N$ vertices. Then we extend the classification to
$P>1$ and find a whole host of new invariants, including those that represent
the most relevant (or least irrelevant) deformations of the corresponding
Gaussian fixed points, and we study their uniqueness.

been studied with near infrared (NIR) interferometry and high resolution
spectroscopy. The continuum and a few molecular gas species have been studied
close to the central star; however, sensitivity problems limit direct
information about the inner disks of the fainter T Tauri stars.
  Aims : Our aim is to measure some of the properties of the inner regions of
disks surrounding southern T Tauri stars.
  Methods : We performed a survey with the PIONIER recombiner instrument at
H-band of 21 T Tauri stars. The baselines used ranged from 11 m to 129 m,
corresponding to a maximum resolution of 3mas (0.45 au at 150 pc).
  Results : Thirteen disks are resolved well and the visibility curves are
fully sampled as a function of baseline in the range 45-130 m for these 13
objects. A simple qualitative examination of visibility profiles allows us to
identify a rapid drop-off in the visibilities at short baselines in 8 resolved
disks. This is indicative of a significant contribution from an extended
contribution of light from the disk. We demonstrate that this component is
compatible with scattered light, providing strong support to a prediction made
by Pinte et al. (2008). The amplitude of the drop-off and the amount of dust
thermal emission changes from source to source suggesting that each disk is
different. A by-product of the survey is the identification of a new
milli-arcsec separation binary: WW Cha. Spectroscopic and interferometric data
of AK Sco have also been fitted with a binary and disk model.
  Conclusions : Visibility data are reproduced well when thermal emission and
scattering form dust are fully considered. The inner radii measured are
consistent with the expected dust sublimation radii. Modelling of AK Sco
suggests a likely coplanarity between the disk and the binary's orbital plane

of quantum correlations among the constituents of a bipartite quantum system.
For pure states, the distance between a given state and its image under
least-perturbing local unitary operations is a bona fide measure of quantum
entanglement, the so-called entanglement of response, which can be extended to
mixed states via the convex roof construction. On the other hand, when defined
directly on mixed states perturbed by local unitary operations, such a distance
turns out to be a bona fide measure of quantum correlations, the so-called
discord of response. Exploiting this unified framework, we perform a detailed
comparison between two-body entanglement and two-body quantum discord in
infinite XY quantum spin chains both in symmetry-preserving and
symmetry-breaking ground states as well as in thermal states at finite
temperature. The results of the investigation show that in symmetry-preserving
ground states the two-point quantum discord dominates over the two-point
entanglement, while in symmetrybreaking ground states the two-point quantum
discord is strongly suppressed and the two-point entanglement is essentially
unchanged. In thermal states, for certain regimes of Hamiltonian parameters, we
show that the pairwise quantum discord and the pairwise entanglement can
increase with increasing thermal fluctuations.

investigating nonuniform magnetization structures inside magnetic materials.
Here, considering a ferromagnetic medium with weakly inhomogeneous uniaxial

derive the second-order (in the amplitude of the inhomogeneities) micromagnetic
solutions for the equilibrium magnetization textures and compute the
corresponding magnetic SANS cross sections up to the next, third order. We find
that in the case of perpendicular scattering (the incident neutron beam is
perpendicular to the applied magnetic field) if twice the cross section along
the direction orthogonal to both the field and the neutron beam is subtracted
from the cross section along the field direction, the result has only a
third-order contribution (the lower-order terms are canceled). This difference
does not depend on the amplitude of the exchange inhomogeneities and provides a
separate gateway for a deeper analysis of the sample's magnetic structure. We
derive and analyze analytical expressions for the dependence of this
combination on the scattering-vector magnitude for the case of spherical
Gaussian inhomogeneities.

least $r$ points) in a `truly' $d$-dimensional configuration of points
$v_1,\ldots,v_n \in \mathbb{C}^d$. More formally, we show that, if the number
of $r$-rich lines is significantly larger than $n^2/r^d$ then there must exist
a large subset of the points contained in a hyperplane. We conjecture that the
factor $r^d$ can be replaced with a tight $r^{d+1}$. If true, this would
generalize the classic Szemer\'edi-Trotter theorem which gives a bound of
$n^2/r^3$ on the number of $r$-rich lines in a planar configuration. This
conjecture was shown to hold in $\mathbb{R}^3$ in the seminal work of Guth and
Katz \cite{GK10} and was also recently proved over $\mathbb{R}^4$ (under some
additional restrictions) \cite{SS14}. For the special case of arithmetic
progressions ($r$ collinear points that are evenly distanced) we give a bound
that is tight up to low order terms, showing that a $d$-dimensional grid
achieves the largest number of $r$-term progressions.
  The main ingredient in the proof is a new method to find a low degree
polynomial that vanishes on many of the rich lines. Unlike previous
applications of the polynomial method, we do not find this polynomial by
interpolation. The starting observation is that the degree $r-2$ Veronese
embedding takes $r$-collinear points to $r$ linearly dependent images. Hence,
each collinear $r$-tuple of points, gives us a dependent $r$-tuple of images.
We then use the design-matrix method of \cite{BDWY12} to convert these 'local'
linear dependencies into a global one, showing that all the images lie in a
hyperplane. This then translates into a low degree polynomial vanishing on the
original set.

constraints on the flavor non-universal and flavor universal charged-current
NSI parameters, estimated using the currently released 621 days of Daya Bay
data. New limits are placed assuming that the new physics effects are just
inverse of each other in the production and detection processes. With this
special choice of the NSI parameters, we observe a shift in the oscillation
amplitude without distorting the $L/E$ pattern of the oscillation probability.
This shift in the depth of the oscillation dip can be caused by the NSI
parameters as well as by $\theta_{13}$, making it quite difficult to
disentangle the NSI effects from the standard oscillations. We explore the
correlations between the NSI parameters and $\theta_{13}$ that may lead to
significant deviations in the reported value of the reactor mixing angle with
the help of iso-probability surface plots. Finally, we present the limits on
electron, muon/tau, and flavor universal (FU) NSI couplings with and without
considering the uncertainty in the normalization of the total event rates.
Assuming a perfect knowledge of the event rates normalization, we find strong
upper bounds $\sim$ 0.1\% for the electron and FU cases improving the present
limits by one order of magnitude. However, for a conservative error of 5\% in
the total normalization, these constraints are relaxed by almost one order of

theorem for $\frac{1}{n}X_{n}$ appropriately scaled in time, where the scaling
limit is given by a nonnegative self-similar Markov process. We also study the
asymptotic behavior of the time needed by $X_{n}$ to reach some fixed finite
set. We identify three different regimes (roughly speaking the transient, the
recurrent and the positive-recurrent regimes) in which $X_{n}$ exhibits
different behavior. The present results extend those of Haas & Miermont who
focused on the case of non-increasing Markov chains. We further present a
number of applications to the study of Markov chains with asymptotically zero
drifts such as Bessel-type random walks, nonnegative self-similar Markov

minimum. We provide an algorithm that takes into account important schema
information to enumerate only the minimal necessary plans among all possible
plans. Importantly, this algorithm is a strict generalization of all known
results of PTIME self-join-free conjunctive queries: A query is safe if and
only if our algorithm returns one single plan. We also apply three relational
query optimization techniques to evaluate all minimal safe plans very fast. We
give a detailed experimental evaluation of our approach and, in the process,
provide a new way of thinking about the value of probabilistic methods over
non-probabilistic methods for ranking query answers.

HCP crystal structures, which are calculated to be very close to each other in
terms of cost function. The simulation of the full model, however, shows that
the approach to such asymptotic states involves several sub-processes over
distinct time scales. The smoothing of the initially irregular multiple fields

Submitted to MNRAS",,"10.1093/mnras/stv405",,"astro-ph.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Low energy interactions between particles are often characterised by elastic
scattering. Just as electrons undergo Thomson scattering with photons, dark
matter particles may experience an analogous form of momentum exchange with
dark energy. We investigate the influence such an interaction has on the
formation of linear and nonlinear cosmic structure, by running for the first
time a suite of N-body simulations with different dark energy equations of
state and scattering cross sections. In models where the linear matter power
spectrum is suppressed by the scattering, we find that on nonlinear scales the
power spectrum is strongly enhanced. This is due to the friction term
increasing the efficiency of gravitational collapse, which also leads to a
scale-independent amplification of the concentration and mass functions of
halos. The opposite trend is found for models characterised by an increase of
the linear matter power spectrum normalisation. More quantitatively, we find
that power spectrum deviations at nonlinear scales ($k \approx 10\, h/$Mpc) are
roughly ten times larger than their linear counterparts, exceeding $100%$ for
the largest value of the scattering cross section considered in the present
work. Similarly, the concentration-mass relation and the halo mass function
show deviations up to $100%$ and $20%$, respectively, over a wide range of
masses. Therefore, we conclude that nonlinear probes of structure formation
might provide much tighter constraints on the scattering cross section between
dark energy and dark matter as compared to the present bounds based on linear
observables.

present an approximately constant abundance of N2H+ and radial intensity

angular momentum transport in Class 0 protostars (when large amounts of
material are fed down to the disk from the envelope and accreted onto the

magnetocentrifugal winds at 50 AU scales. In addition, with the data to date
there is an early, tentative trend that R>30 AU disks have so far been found in
Class 0 systems with average magnetic fields on the 1000 AU scale strongly
misaligned with the rotation axis. The absence of such a disk in the aligned

of ideal MHD, while CRs are treated as relativistic Lagrangian particles
subject to the Lorentz force. Backreaction from CRs to the gas is included in
the form of momentum and energy feedback. In addition, we include the
electromagnetic feedback due to CR-induced Hall effect that becomes important
when the electron-ion drift velocity of the background plasma induced by CRs
approaches the Alfv\'en velocity. Our method is applicable on scales much
larger than the ion inertial length, bypassing the microscopic scales that must
be resolved in conventional PIC methods, while retaining the full kinetic
nature of the CRs. We have implemented and tested this method in the Athena MHD
code, where the overall scheme is second-order accurate and fully conservative.
As a first application, we describe a numerical experiment to study particle
acceleration in non-relativistic shocks. Using a simplified prescription for
ion injection, we reproduce the shock structure and the CR energy spectra
obtained with more self-consistent hybrid-PIC simulations, but at substantially
reduced computational cost. We also show that the CR-induced Hall effect
reduces the growth rate of the Bell instability and affects the gas dynamics in
the vicinity of the shock front. As a step forward, we are able to capture the
transition of particle acceleration from non relativistic to relativistic
regimes, with momentum spectrum $f(p)\sim p^{-4}$ connecting smoothly through
the transition, as expected from the theory of Fermi acceleration.

gas outflows through stellar radiation pressure. Molecular gas is the phase of
the interstellar medium from which stars form, so these outflows curtail
stellar mass growth in galaxies. Previously known outflows, however, involve
small fractions of the total molecular gas content and are restricted to
sub-kiloparsec scales. It is also apparent that input from active galactic
nuclei is in at least some cases dynamically important, so pure stellar
feedback has been considered incapable of aggressively terminating star
formation on galactic scales. Extraplanar molecular gas has been detected in
the archetype starburst galaxy M82, but so far there has been no evidence that
starbursts can propel significant quantities of cold molecular gas to the same
galactocentric radius (~10 kpc) as the warmer gas traced by metal absorbers.
Here we report observations of molecular gas in a compact (effective radius 100
pc) massive starburst galaxy at z=0.7, which is known to drive a fast outflow
of ionized gas. We find that 35 per cent of the total molecular gas is
spatially extended on a scale of approximately 10 kpc, and one third of this
has a velocity of up to 1000 km/s. The kinetic energy associated with this
high-velocity component is consistent with the momentum flux available from
stellar radiation pressure. This result demonstrates that nuclear bursts of
star formation are capable of ejecting large amounts of cold gas from the
central regions of galaxies, thereby strongly affecting their evolution.

with $N$ axions $\theta^i$, the fundamental domain is a polytope defined by the
periodicities of the axions, via constraints of the form $-\pi<Q^{i}_{j}
\theta^j<\pi$. We compute the diameter of the fundamental domain in terms of
the eigenvalues $f_1^2\le\...\le f_N^2$ of the metric on field space, and also,
crucially, the largest eigenvalue of $(QQ^{\top})^{-1}$. At large $N$,
$QQ^{\top}$ approaches a Wishart matrix, due to universality, and we show that
the diameter is at least $N f_{N}$, exceeding the naive Pythagorean range by a
factor $>\sqrt{N}$. This result is robust in the presence of $P>N$ constraints,
while for $P=N$ the diameter is further enhanced by eigenvector delocalization
to $N^{3/2}f_N$. We directly verify our results in explicit Calabi-Yau

measure the growth of cosmological structure with time and thereby constrain
dark energy. One major systematic uncertainty in this process is the
calibration of the weak lensing shape distortions, or shears. Most upcoming
surveys plan to test several aspects of their shear estimation algorithms using
sophisticated image simulations that include realistic galaxy populations based
on high-resolution data from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). However,
existing datasets from the (HST) cover very small cosmological volumes, so
cosmic variance could cause the galaxy populations in them to be atypical. A
narrow redshift slice from such surveys could be dominated by a single large
overdensity or underdensity. In that case, the morphology-density relation
could alter the local galaxy populations and yield an incorrect calibration of
shear estimates as a function of redshift. We directly test this scenario using
the COSMOS survey, the largest-area (HST) survey to date, and show how the
statistical distributions of galaxy shapes and morphological parameters (e.g.,
S\'{e}rsic $n$) are influenced by redshift-dependent cosmic variance. The
typical variation in RMS ellipticity due to environmental effects is 5 per cent
(absolute, not relative) for redshift bins of width $\Delta z=0.05$, which
could result in uncertain shear calibration at the 1 per cent level. We
conclude that the cosmic variance effects are large enough to exceed the
systematic error budget of future surveys, but can be mitigated with careful
choice of training dataset and sufficiently large redshift binning.

the neutrinos escaped with a negligible effect on the outer layers, which
inevitably collapse. As the shells collapse, they compress and heat up
adiabatically, enhancing the rate of thermonuclear burning. In some cases,
where significant shells of mixed helium and oxygen are present with

fluid theory - the magnetorotational instability mediated by magnetic tension -
is replaced by two distinct instabilities, one associated with ions and one
with electrons. Each of these has a different way of tapping into the free
energy of differential rotation. The ion instability is driven by viscous
transport of momentum across magnetic field lines due to a finite ion cyclotron
frequency (gyroviscosity); the fastest growing modes have wavelengths
significantly longer than MHD and Hall MHD predictions. The electron
instability is a whistler mode driven unstable by the temperature anisotropy
generated by differential rotation; the growth time can be orders of magnitude
shorter than the rotation period. The electron instability is an example of a
broader class of instabilities that tap into the free energy of differential
rotation or shear via the temperature anisotropy they generate. We briefly

anytime pole-like excitations are replaced by ones that have a divergent
self-energy. Such a breakdown obtains in electronic systems whose pole-like
excitations do not extend to the edge of the Brillouin zone, as in Fermi arcs
in the cuprates. Since any non-trivial infrared dynamics in strongly correlated
electron matter must be controlled by a critical fixed point, unparticles are
the natural candidate to explain the presence of charged degrees of freedom
that have no particle content. The continuous mass formulation of unparticles
is recast as an action in anti de Sitter space. Such an action serves as the
generating functional for the propagator. This mapping fixes the scaling
dimension of the unparticle to be $d_U=d/2+\sqrt{d^2+4}/2$ and ensures that the
corresponding propagator has zeros with $d$ the spacetime dimension of the
unparticle field. The general {\it dynamical} mechanism by which bulk
operators, such as the Pauli term, couple to the scaling dimension of the
boundary operator and thereby lead to a vanishing of the spectral weight at
zero energy is reviewed in the context of unparticles and zeros. The analogue
of the BCS gap equations with unparticles indicates that the transition
temperature increases as the attractive interaction strength decreases,
indicating that unparticles are highly susceptible to a superconducting

(iii) confining effects, which become increasingly important as the baryon
density decreases; (iv) non-perturbative gluons, which are not very sensitive
to changes of the quark density. We use the following ""3-window"" description:
At baryon densities below about twice normal nuclear density, 2n_0, we use the

(4-7)n_0, we use the three-flavor Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model supplemented
by vector and diquark interactions. In the transition density region, we
smoothly interpolate the hadronic and quark equations of state in the chemical
potential-pressure plane. Requiring that the equation of state approach APR at
low densities, we find that the quark pressure in non-confining models can be
larger than the hadronic pressure, unlike in conventional equations of state.

(TI) to a trivial band insulator (BI) is induced as one of the gaps becomes
zero, and the system enters a valley-spin polarized metallic state (VSPM). In
an external magnetic field ($B$), a distinct signature of the transition is
seen in the derivative of the magnetization with respect to chemical potential
($\mu$) which gives the quantization of the Hall plateaus through the Streda
relation. When plotted as a function of the external electric field, the
magnetization has an abrupt change in slope at its minimum which signals the
VSPM state. The magnetic susceptibility ($\chi$) shows jumps as a function of
$\mu$ when a band gap is crossed which provides a measure of the gaps'
variation as a function of external electric field. Alternatively, at fixed
$\mu$, the susceptibility displays an increasingly large diamagnetic response
as the electric field approaches the critical value of the VSPM phase. In the
VSPM state, magnetic oscillations exist for any value of chemical potential
while for the TI, and BI state, $\mu$ must be larger than the minimum gap in
the system. When $\mu$ is larger than both gaps, there are two fundamental
cyclotron frequencies (which can also be tuned by $E_z$) involved in the
de-Haas van-Alphen oscillations which are close in magnitude. This causes a
prominent beating pattern to emerge.

and object detection systems. Most previous work utilizes low-level features
such as texture or saliency to detect contours and then use them as cues for a
higher-level task such as object detection. However, we claim that recognizing
objects and predicting contours are two mutually related tasks. Contrary to
traditional approaches, we show that we can invert the commonly established
pipeline: instead of detecting contours with low-level cues for a higher-level
recognition task, we exploit object-related features as high-level cues for
contour detection.
  We achieve this goal by means of a multi-scale deep network that consists of
five convolutional layers and a bifurcated fully-connected sub-network. The
section from the input layer to the fifth convolutional layer is fixed and
directly lifted from a pre-trained network optimized over a large-scale object
classification task. This section of the network is applied to four different
scales of the image input. These four parallel and identical streams are then
attached to a bifurcated sub-network consisting of two independently-trained
branches. One branch learns to predict the contour likelihood (with a
classification objective) whereas the other branch is trained to learn the
fraction of human labelers agreeing about the contour presence at a given point
(with a regression criterion).
  We show that without any feature engineering our multi-scale deep learning
approach achieves state-of-the-art results in contour detection.

perform collisional probability simulations of the Fomalhaut debris disk based
on the structure of our Kuiper belt, finding that the catastrophic disruption
rate of d ~ 100 km bodies in the high-eccentricity scattering component is
several per decade. This model paints a picture of the Fomalhaut system as
having recently (within ~10-100 Myr) experienced a dynamical instability within
its planetary system, which scattered a massive number of planetesimals onto
large, high eccentricity orbits similar to that of Fom b. If Fomalhaut b is
indeed a dust cloud produced by such a collision, we should soon see another

beyond the conventional scenario in which a single quantum critical point
separates the superconductor and the insulator in the presence of a
perpendicular $H$. Similar two-stage $H$-driven SIT, in which both disorder and
quantum phase fluctuations play an important role, may also be expected in
other copper-oxide high-temperature superconductors.

Here we show that single-junction nanostructured solar cells have a theoretical

calculations show that when particles reach the size for which the radial
migration is the fastest they tend to be accreted very efficiently by the star.
This is known as the radial-drift barrier. We explore the photophoresis in the
inner regions of PPD as a possible mechanism for preventing the accretion of
solid bodies onto the star. Photophoresis is the thermal creep induced by the
momentum exchange of an illuminated solid particle with the surrounding gas.
Recent laboratory experiments predict that photophoresis would be able to stop
the inward drift of macroscopic bodies (from 1 mm to 1 m in size). This extra
force has been included in our two-fluid (gas+dust) SPH code in order to study
its efficiency. We show that the conditions of pressure and temperature
encountered in the inner regions of PPD result in strong dynamical effects on
the dust particles due to photophoresis. Our simulations show that there is a
radial and a vertical sorting of the dust grains according to their sizes and
their intrinsic densities. Thus, our calculations support the fact that
photophoresis is a mechanism which can have a strong effect on the morphology
of the inner regions of PPD, ultimately affecting the fate of planetesimals.

the Kadison-Singer conjecture by proving that for any set of finitely supported
independently distributed random vectors $v_1,\dots, v_n$ which have ""small""
expected squared norm and are in isotropic position (in expectation), there is
a positive probability that the sum $\sum v_i v_i^\intercal$ has small spectral
norm. Their proof crucially employs real stability of polynomials which is the
natural generalization of real-rootedness to multivariate polynomials.
  Strongly Rayleigh distributions are families of probability distributions
whose generating polynomials are real stable \cite{BBL09}. As independent
distributions are just special cases of strongly Rayleigh measures, it is a
natural question to see if the main theorem of \cite{MSS13} can be extended to
families of vectors assigned to the elements of a strongly Rayleigh
distribution.
  In this paper we answer this question affirmatively; we show that for any
homogeneous strongly Rayleigh distribution where the marginal probabilities are
upper bounded by $\epsilon_1$ and any isotropic set of vectors assigned to the
underlying elements whose norms are at most $\sqrt{\epsilon_2}$, there is a set
in the support of the distribution such that the spectral norm of the sum of
the natural quadratic forms of the vectors assigned to the elements of the set
is at most $O(\epsilon_1+\epsilon_2)$. We employ our theorem to provide a
sufficient condition for the existence of spectrally thin trees. This, together
with a recent work of the authors \cite{AO14}, provides an improved upper bound

fundamental operations of modern computations. The efficiency of its
performance depends on various factors, in particular vectorization, data
movement and arithmetic complexity of the computations, but here we focus just
on the study of the arithmetic cost and the impact of this study on other areas
of modern computing. In the early 1970s it was expected that the
straightforward cubic time algorithm for MM will soon be accelerated to enable
MM in nearly quadratic arithmetic time, with some far fetched implications.
While pursuing this goal the mainstream research had its focus on the decrease
of the classical exponent 3 of the complexity of MM towards its lower bound 2,
disregarding the growth of the input size required to support this decrease.
Eventually, surprising combinations of novel ideas and sophisticated techniques
enabled the decrease of the exponent to its benchmark value of about 2.38, but
the supporting MM algorithms improved the straightforward one only for the
inputs of immense sizes. Meanwhile, the communication complexity, rather than
the arithmetic complexity, has become the bottleneck of computations in linear
algebra. This development may seem to undermine the value of the past and
future research aimed at the decrease of the arithmetic cost of MM, but we feel
that the study should be reassessed rather than closed and forgotten. We review
the old and new work in this area in the present day context, recall some major
techniques introduced in the study of MM, discuss their impact on the modern
theory and practice of computations for MM and beyond MM, and link one of these
techniques to some simple algorithms for inner product and summation.

image of the CDF-N. We confirm the FIR-radio and MIR-radio correlations to z=4
using the non-X-ray detected radio sources. Both correlations are also obeyed
by the X-ray less luminous AGNs but not by the X-ray quasars. We interpret the
low FIR luminosities relative to the MIR for the X-ray quasars as being due to
a lack of star formation, while the MIR stays high due to the AGN contribution.
We find that the FIR luminosity distributions are highly skewed and the means
are dominated by a small number of high-luminosity galaxies. Thus, stacking or
averaging analyses will overestimate the level of star formation taking place
in the bulk of the X-ray sample. We conclude that most of the host galaxies of

maximum (flattening index {\epsilon} = 0.01), showing a change from the
composite coronal images that we had observed and analyzed in this journal and
elsewhere for the 2006, 2008, 2009, and 2010 eclipses. After crossing the
northeast Australian coast, the rest of the path of totality was over the
ocean, so further totality was seen only by shipborne observers. Our results
include measurements of velocities of a coronal mass ejection; during the 36
minutes of passage from the Queensland coast to a ship north of New Zealand, we
find a speed of 413 km/s, and we analyze its dynamics. We discuss the shapes
and positions of several types of coronal features seen on our
higher-resolution composite Queensland images of the solar corona, including,
many helmet streamers, very faint bright and dark loops at the base of helmet
streamers, voids and radially oriented thin streamers. We compare our eclipse
observations with a hairy-ball model of the magnetic field, confirming the
validity of the prediction, and we relate the eclipse phenomenology seen with
the near-simultaneous images from the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly on the

been profoundly modified by their interaction with the surrounding interstellar
medium (ISM). Old SNRs are very heterogenous in terms of their appearance,
reflecting differences in their evolutionary state, the environments in which
SNe explode and in the explosion products. Some old SNRs are seen primarily as
a result of a strong shock wave interacting with the ISM. Others, the so-called
mixed-morphology SNRs, show central concentrations of emission, which may still
show evidence of emission from the ejecta. Yet others, the pulsar wind nebulae
(PWNe), are seen primarily as a result of emission powered by a pulsar; these
SNRs often lack the detectable thermal emission from the primary shock. The
underlying goal in all studies of old SNRs is to understand these differences,
in terms of the SNe that created them, the nature of the ISM into which they
are expanding, and the fundamental physical processes that govern their
evolution. Here we identify three areas of study where ASTRO-H can make
important contributions. These are constraining abundances and physical
processes in mature limb-brightened SNRs, understanding the puzzling nature of

These multiple lines suggest that the GCXE is composed of at least two plasmas
with temperatures of ~1 and ~7 keV. The GCXE also exhibits the K-shell lines
from neutral Si, S, Ar, Ca, Fe and Ni atoms. A debatable issue is the origin of
the GCXE plasma; whether it is a diffuse plasma or integrated emission of many
unresolved point sources such as cataclysmic variables and active binaries.
Detailed spectroscopy for these lines may provide a reliable picture of the
GCXE plasma. The origin of the K-shell lines from neutral atoms is most likely
the fluorescence by X-rays from a putative past flare of Sgr A*. Therefore
ASTRO-H may provide unprecedented data for the past light curve of Sgr A*. All
these lines may provide key information for the dynamics of the GCXE, using
possible Doppler shift and/or line broadening. This paper overviews these line

outflows from active galactic nuclei. The most important breakthroughs in this
field are expected to arise from the high spectral resolution and sensitivity
in the Fe-K band, combined with broad-band sensitivity over the full X-ray band
and spectral capabilities also at lower energies. The sensitivity in the Fe-K
region allows to extend the absorption measure distribution of the outflow out
to the highest ionisation states accessible, where observations with current
X-ray missions indicate that most of the outflowing gas is to be found. Due to
the high-resolution and sensitivity it will also be able to give the definitive
proof for the existence of ultra-fast outflows, and if so, characterise their
physical properties in great detail. These ultra-fast outflows carry very large
amounts of energy and momentum, and are of fundamental importance for feedback
studies. We show how the ASTRO-H observations in general can help to constrain
numerical models for outflows. The link to reflection and emission processes is
also discussed, as well as the possible relation between outflows and
relativistic emission lines. Finally, we discuss the prospects for other
related categories of objects like BAL quasars, partially covered sources and
Compton thick outflows.

topics include: shock acceleration in supernova remnants (SNRs) and in clusters
of galaxies, and the extreme particle acceleration seen in gamma-ray binaries.
Since the hydrodynamics and thermal properties of shocks in these objects are
covered in other white papers, we focus on the aspects related to the process
of particle acceleration. In the case of SNRs, we emphasize the importance of
SXS and HXI observations of the X-ray emission of young SNRs dominated by
synchrotron radiation, particularly SNR RX J1713.7-3946. We argue that the HXI
observations of young SNRs, as a byproduct of SXS observations dedicated for
studies of the shock dynamics and nucleosynthesis, will provide powerful
constraints on shock acceleration theories. Also, we discuss gamma-ray binary
systems, where extreme particle acceleration is inferred regardless of the
nature (a neutron star or a black hole) of the compact object. Finally, for
galaxy clusters, we propose searches for hard X-ray emission of secondary
electrons from interactions of ultra-high energy cosmic rays accelerated at
accretion shocks. This should allow us to understand the contribution of galaxy
clusters to the flux of cosmic rays above 10^18 eV.

to irradiation by this continuum. This White Paper describes the prospects for

High-resolution SXS spectroscopy of the resulting fluorescent iron line in

us to assess its dynamics (through line broadening) and geometry (through the
line profile as well as observations of the ""Compton shoulder""). The broad-band

characterize the shape of the underlying continuum (which may be heavily
absorbed) and reflection/scattering, providing crucial constraints on models
for the Cosmic X-ray Background with a subsequent impact on understanding of
supermassive black hole evolution. ASTRO-H will also permit the
relativistically broadened reflection spectrum from the inner accretion disk to
be robustly studied, even in complex systems with, for example, warm absorption
and composite soft excesses. Finally, the HXI will allow the detection and

us to detect emission and absorption features from heavy elements in the
circumstellar material in the host galaxies, from the intergalactic medium

existence of the warm-hot intergalactic material (WHIM), thought to contain
most of the baryons at redshift of z < ~3, with a typical exposure of one day
for a follow-up observation of a GRB afterglow or 300 ks exposure for several
distant Blazars. In addition to the chemical evolution study, the combination
of the SGD, HXI, SXI and SXS will measure, for the first time, the temporal
behavior of the spectral continuum of GRB afterglows and Blazars over a broad
energy range and short time scales allowing detailed modeling of jets. The
ability to obtain these data from GRB afterglows will depend critically on the

  JMLR version",,,,"cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Natural gradient descent is an optimization method traditionally motivated
from the perspective of information geometry, and works well for many
applications as an alternative to stochastic gradient descent. In this paper we
critically analyze this method and its properties, and show how it can be
viewed as a type of 2nd-order optimization method, with the Fisher information
matrix acting as a substitute for the Hessian. In many important cases, the
Fisher information matrix is shown to be equivalent to the Generalized
Gauss-Newton matrix, which both approximates the Hessian, but also has certain
properties that favor its use over the Hessian. This perspective turns out to
have significant implications for the design of a practical and robust natural
gradient optimizer, as it motivates the use of techniques like trust regions
and Tikhonov regularization. Additionally, we make a series of contributions to
the understanding of natural gradient and 2nd-order methods, including: a
thorough analysis of the convergence speed of stochastic natural gradient
descent (and more general stochastic 2nd-order methods) as applied to convex
quadratics, a critical examination of the oft-used ""empirical"" approximation of
the Fisher matrix, and an analysis of the (approximate) parameterization
invariance property possessed by natural gradient methods (which we show also
holds for certain other curvature, but notably not the Hessian).

the scattered disc, an unstable planetesimal population beyond Neptune. This
viewpoint has been widely accepted, but a few issues remain, the most prominent
of which are the total number of visible JFCs with a perihelion distance q<2.5
AU and the corresponding number of objects in the scattered disc. In this work
we give a robust estimate of the number of visible JFCs with q<2.5 AU and
diameter D>2.3 km based on recent observational data. This is combined with
numerical simulations that use a simple fading law applied to JFCs that come
close to the Sun. For this we numerically evolve thousands of comets from the
scattered disc through the realm of the giant planets and keep track of their
number of perihelion passages with perihelion distance q<2.5 AU, below which
the activity is supposed to increase considerably. We can simultaneously fit
the JFC inclination and semi-major axis distribution accurately with a delayed
power law fading function and the maximum perihelion distance below which the
observational data is complete is q~2.3 AU. From observational data we
calculate that a JFC with diameter D=2.3 km has a typical total absolute
magnitude H_T=10.8, and the steady-state number of active JFCs with diameter
D>2.3 km and q<2.5 AU is of the order of 300 (but with large uncertainties),
approximately a factor two higher than earlier estimates. The increased JFC
population results in a scattered disc population of 6 billion objects and
decreases the observed Oort cloud to scattered disc population ratio to 13,
virtually the same as the value of 12 obtained with numerical simulations.

tension and the loop is modeled as an elastic rod resistant to both bending and
twist. The first and second energy variations of the underlying energy
functional are derived, leading to governing equilibrium equations and
stability criteria. The latter criteria are employed to explore the stability
of flat circular configurations with respect to planar and transverse
perturbations. Experiments are performed to study post-buckled configurations
and to explore the validity of the theoretical predictions. Imparting a twist
to the bounding loop destabilizes flat circular loops which are short-enough to
be stable when twist-free. Nevertheless, when the circular disk is perturbed
merely radially or merely transversely, the stability condition is indifferent
to twist. By the equilibrium equations, the twisting angle of a planar
equilibrium configuration should be distributed uniformly along the loop. The
stability criteria guarantee that this uniformity is preserved after buckling.
The stability with respect to increasing the surface tension of the film or the
length of the loop is sensitive to the cross-sectional thickness of the
bounding loop. However, stability with respect to increasing the total twist is
indifferent to that thickness.

\delta_c$, the relaxation time $\tau$ diverges obeying the finite size scaling
law: $\tau \sim L^{\beta}(|\delta-\delta_c| L^{\alpha})$ with $\alpha, \beta =
0.33 \pm 0.05$. At $\delta_c$, the system fails, at the critical load, in
avalanches (of rupturing fibers) of all sizes $s$ following the distribution
$P(s) \sim s^{-\kappa}$, with $\kappa = 0.50 \pm 0.01$. We relate this critical
behavior to brittle to quasi-brittle transition.

century text, Mary Astell's seminal essay, A Serious Proposal to the Ladies,
part I, published in 1694. We first focused on the semantics to see how Astell
builds her vindication of the female sex, which words she uses to sensitise
women to their alienated condition and promote their education. Then we studied
the morphology of the lexemes (which is different from contemporary English)
used by the author, thanks to the NooJ tools we have devised for this purpose.
NooJ has great functionalities for lexicographic work. Its commands and graphs
prove to be most efficient in the spotting of archaic words or variants in
spelling. Introduction In our previous articles, we have studied the
singularities of 17 th century English within the framework of a diachronic
analysis thanks to syntactical and morphological graphs and thanks to the
dictionaries we have compiled from a corpus that may be expanded overtime. Our
early work was based on a limited corpus of English travel literature to Greece
in the 17 th century. This article deals with a late seventeenth century text
written by a woman philosopher and essayist, Mary Astell (1666--1731),
considered as one of the first English feminists. Astell wrote her essay at a
time in English history when women were ""the weaker vessel"" and their main
business in life was to charm and please men by their looks and submissiveness.
In this essay we will see how NooJ can help us analyse Astell's rhetoric (what
point of view does she adopt, does she speak in her own name, in the name of
all women, what is her representation of men and women and their relationships
in the text, what are the goals of education?). Then we will turn our attention
to the morphology of words in the text and use NooJ commands and graphs to
carry out a lexicographic inquiry into Astell's lexemes.

construct simulation schemes for data vectors $d(T)$ from measurements $d(0)$

concrete assumptions about the subgrid structure of the problem. In this work,
the measure theoretical fundament and the necessary probabilistic framework for
IFD are introduced first. The notation for the rest of the work is established
and essential properties are developed. Afterwards, the general setting for IFD
is described, consisting of the signal with its evolution equation and its
linear connection to the data by a response operator. The developed environment
is then used, to step by step imbed the physical language, used in Torsten
En{\ss}lin's work, into a mathematical framework. Also a general approach for
the approximation of an evolution equation is given, serving as a base to
describe the construction of a simulation scheme with IFD. Simulation errors in
the various steps are pointed out, to give an idea where inaccuracies come in
and which steps therefore lead to the necessity of many degrees of freedom of
the signal and of many time steps within the simulation. In the end, IFD is
illustrated in an example scenario. A matrix relation for the update steps of
IFD is derived. It allows to simulate a data vector $d(T)$ which averages a
Klein-Gordon field with one dimension in space and periodic over $[0,2\pi)$.
Also a non-iterative equation for the direct computation of $d(T)$ from $d(0)$
is constructed. This is reached by the fact that the original problem converts
into an ordinary differential equation for the data, if the simulation time
steps get infinitesimally small.

method to perform accurate color calibration for modern imaging surveys, taking
advantage of millions of stellar spectra now available. The method is
straightforward, insensitive to systematic errors in the spectroscopically
determined stellar atmospheric parameters, applicable to regions that are
effectively covered by spectroscopic surveys, and capable of delivering an
accuracy of a few millimagnitudes for color calibration. As an illustration, we
have applied the method to the SDSS Stripe 82 data (Ivezic et al; I07
hereafter). With a total number of 23,759 spectroscopically targeted stars, we
have mapped out the small but strongly correlated color zero point errors
present in the photometric catalog of Stripe 82, and improve the color
calibration by a factor of 2 -- 3. Our study also reveals some small but
significant magnitude dependence errors in z-band for some CCDs. Such errors
are likely to be present in all the SDSS photometric data. Our results are
compared with those from a completely independent test based on the intrinsic
colors of red galaxies presented by I07. The comparison as well as other tests
shows that the SCR method has achieved a color calibration internally
consistent at a level of about 5 mmag in u-g, 3 mmag in g-r, and 2 mmag in r-i
and i-z, respectively. Given the power of the SCR method, we discuss briefly

determinations, and calibrations. However, hitherto the dependence of stellar
loci on metallicity has not been fully explored and their intrinsic widths are
unclear. In this paper, by combining the spectroscopic and re-calibrated
imaging data of the SDSS Stripe 82, we have built a large, clean sample of
dwarf stars with accurate colors and well determined metallicities to
investigate the metallicity dependence and intrinsic widths of the SDSS stellar
loci. Typically, one dex decrease in metallicity causes 0.20 and 0.02 mag
decrease in colors u-g and g-r, and 0.02 and 0.02 mag increase in colors r-i
and i-z, respectively. The variations are larger for metal-rich stars than for
metal-poor ones, and for F/G/K stars than for A/M ones. Using the sample, we
have performed two dimensional polynomial fitting to the u-g, g-r, r-i, and i-z
colors as a function of color g-i and metallicity [Fe/H]. The residuals, at the
level of 0.029, 0.008, 0.008 and 0.011 mag for the u-g, g-r, r-i, and i-z

metallicity uncertainties, suggesting that the intrinsic widths of the loci are
at maximum a few mmag. The residual distributions are asymmetric, revealing
that a significant fraction of stars are binaries. In a companion paper, we
will present an unbiased estimate of the binary fraction for field stars. Other
potential applications of the metallicity dependent stellar loci are briefly

between 0.3 -- 0.6, 0.6 -- 0.9, 0.9 -- 1.2, and 1.2 - 1.6\,mag. A modest
metallicity dependence is also found. The fraction decreases with increasing
metallicity. For stars of [Fe/H] between $-0.5$ - 0.0, $-1.0$ - $-0.5$, $-1.5$
- $-1.0$, and $-2.0$ - $-1.5$\,dex, the inferred binary fractions are
$37%\pm3%$, $39%\pm3%$, $50%\pm9%$, and $53%\pm20%$, respectively. We have
further divided the sample into stars from the thin disk, the thick disk, the
transition zone between them, and the halo. The results suggest that the
Galactic thin and thick disks have comparable binary fractions, whereas the
Galactic halo contains a significantly larger fraction of binaries. Applying
the method to the LAMOST spectroscopic sample yields consistent results.
Finally, other potential applications and future work with the method are
discussed.

Delta-function potential. Our underlying strategy of deriving a numerical phase
accurate finite difference scheme in time domain is to reduce the numerical

numerical and exact modified wavenumbers. Additionally, to achieve the goal of
conserving Hamiltonians in the completely integrable equation of current
interest, a symplecticity-preserving time-stepping scheme is developed. Based
on the solutions computed from the temporally symplecticity-preserving and the
spatially wavenumber-preserving scheme, the long-time asymptotic CH solution
characters can be accurately depicted in distinct regions of the space-time

behaviors. We also aim to numerically confirm that in the two transition zones
their long-time asymptotics can indeed be described in terms of the
theoretically derived Painlev\'e transcendents. Another attempt of this study
is to numerically exhibit a close connection between the presently predicted
finite-difference solution and the solution of the Painlev\'e ordinary

on initial conditions of galaxy formation, and physical correlations between
dust, gas, and stellar contents at different z based on our original
chemodynamical simulations of galaxy formation with dust growth and
destruction. In this preliminary investigation, we first determine the
reasonable ranges of the most important two parameters for dust evolution,
i.e., the timescales of dust growth and destruction, by comparing the observed
and simulated dust properties and molecular hydrogen H2 content of the Galaxy.
We then investigate the z-evolution of dust-to-gas-ratios (D) and, H2 gas
fraction (f_H2), and gas-phase chemical abundances (e.g., A_O=12+log(O/H)) in
the simulated disk and dwarf galaxies. The principal results are as follows.
Both D and f_H2 can rapidly increase during the early dissipative formation of
galactic disks (z ~ 2-3) and the z-evolution of these depends on initial mass
densities, spin parameters, and masses of galaxies. The observed A_O-D relation
can be qualitatively reproduced, but the simulated dispersion of D at a given
A_O is smaller. The simulated galaxies with larger total dust masses show
larger H2 and stellar masses and higher f_H2. Disk galaxies show negative
radial gradients of D and the gradients are steeper for more massive galaxies.
Both dust-to-metal ratios and gas-phase [S/Fe] can be significantly different
within a single galaxy and between different galaxies at different z, which
means that fixed dust-to-metal ratios should not be used in investigating H2
contents and spectral energy distributions of galaxies.

optimization. We focus on the case of linear programs (LPs) in dictionary form,
given by $n$ equality constraints in $n+d$ variables, where the variables are
constrained to be nonnegative. A variable $x_r$ is called redundant, if after
removing $x_r \geq 0$ the LP still has the same feasible region. The time
needed to solve such an LP is denoted by $LP(n,d)$.
  It is easy to see that solving $n+d$ LPs of the above size is sufficient to
detect all redundancies. The currently fastest practical method is the one by
Clarkson: it solves $n+d$ linear programs, but each of them has at most $s$
variables, where $s$ is the number of nonredundant constraints.
  In the first part we show that knowing all of the finitely many dictionaries
of the LP is sufficient for the purpose of redundancy detection. A dictionary
is a matrix that can be thought of as an enriched encoding of a vertex in the
LP. Moreover - and this is the combinatorial aspect - it is enough to know only
the signs of the entries, the actual values do not matter. Concretely we show
that for any variable $x_r$ one can find a dictionary, such that its sign
pattern is either a redundancy or nonredundancy certificate for $x_r$.
  In the second part we show that considering only the sign patterns of the
dictionary, there is an output sensitive algorithm of running time
$\mathcal{O}(d \cdot (n+d) \cdot s^{d-1} \cdot LP(s,d) + d \cdot s^{d} \cdot
LP(n,d))$ to detect all redundancies. In the case where all constraints are in
general position, the running time is $\mathcal{O}(s \cdot LP(n,d) + (n+d)
\cdot LP(s,d))$, which is essentially the running time of the Clarkson method.
Our algorithm extends naturally to a more general setting of arrangements of
oriented topological hyperplane arrangements.

for population genetics research. It is expected that genomic data will
increase our ability to reconstruct the history of populations. While this
increase in genetic information will likely help biologists and anthropologists
to reconstruct the demographic history of populations, it also represents new
challenges. Recent work has shown that structured populations generate signals
of population size change. As a consequence it is often difficult to determine
whether demographic events such as expansions or contractions (bottlenecks)
inferred from genetic data are real or due to the fact that populations are
structured in nature. Given that few inferential methods allow us to account
for that structure, and that genomic data will necessarily increase the
precision of parameter estimates, it is important to develop new approaches. In
the present study we analyse two demographic models. The first is a model of
instantaneous population size change whereas the second is the classical
symmetric island model. We (i) re-derive the distribution of coalescence times
under the two models for a sample of size two, (ii) use a maximum likelihood
approach to estimate the parameters of these models (iii) validate this
estimation procedure under a wide array of parameter combinations, (iv)
implement and validate a model choice procedure by using a Kolmogorov-Smirnov
test. Altogether we show that it is possible to estimate parameters under
several models and perform efficient model choice using genetic data from a

initiated with formation of $trans$-$cis$ chains. These chains further
connected within layers and formed a chain-planar state, which we describe as a
mixture of two crystalline structures - $trans$-$cis$ chain phase and $planar$
phase, both with $Pnma$ symmetry. This mixed state appeared in molecular
dynamics performed at 120 GPa and 1500 K and in the metadynamics run at 110 GPa

formed cg-N. During separate simulations, we also found two new phases -
molecular $P2_1/c$ and two-three-coordinated chain-like $Cm$. The
transformation mechanism heading towards cg-N can be characterized as a
progressive polymerization process passing through several intermediate states
of variously connected $trans$-$cis$ chains. In the final stage of the
transformation chains in the layered form rearrange collectively and develop
new intraplanar as well as interplanar bonds leading to the geometry of cg-N.

$O(\log^{*} n)$ query time. For $\LCEPT$ queries, we present a linear-space

lower bound showing that any path-tree LCE structure of size $O(n \polylog(n))$
must necessarily use $\Omega(\log\log n)$ time to answer queries. For $\LCETT$
queries, we present a time-space trade-off, that given any parameter $\tau$, $1
\leq \tau \leq n$, leads to an $O(n\tau)$ space and $O(n/\tau)$ query-time
solution. This is complemented with a reduction to the the set intersection
problem implying that a fast linear space solution is not likely to exist.

space-time discontinuous Galerkin method for the solution of the two
dimensional incompressible Navier-Stokes equations on staggered unstructured
triangular meshes. Isoparametric finite elements are used to take into account
curved domain boundaries. The discrete pressure is defined on the primal
triangular grid and the discrete velocity field is defined on an edge-based
staggered dual grid. While staggered meshes are state of the art in classical
finite difference approximations of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations,
their use in the context of high order DG schemes is novel and still quite
rare. Formal substitution of the discrete momentum equation into the discrete
continuity equation yields a sparse four-point block system for the scalar
pressure, which is conveniently solved with a matrix-free GMRES algorithm. A
very simple and efficient Picard iteration is then used in order to achieve
high order of accuracy also in time, which is in general a non-trivial task in
the context of high order discretizations for the incompressible Navier-Stokes
equations. The flexibility and accuracy of high order space-time DG methods on
curved unstructured meshes allows to discretize even complex physical domains
with very coarse grids in both, space and time. The use of a staggered grid
allows to avoid the use of Riemann solvers in several terms of the discrete
equations and significantly reduces the total stencil size of the linear system
that needs to be solved for the pressure. The proposed method is validated for
approximation polynomials of degree up to $p=4$ in space and time by solving a
series of typical numerical test problems and by comparing the obtained
numerical results with available exact analytical solutions or other numerical
reference data.

graphs $G_1$ and $G_2$, one looks for a graph with the maximum number of
vertices being both an induced subgraph of $G_1$ and $G_2$. MCIS is among the
most studied classical NP-hard problems. It remains NP-hard on many graph
classes including forests. In this paper, we study the parameterized complexity
of MCIS. As a generalization of \textsc{Clique}, it is W[1]-hard parameterized
by the size of the solution. Being NP-hard even on forests, most structural
parameterizations are intractable. One has to go as far as parameterizing by
the size of the minimum vertex cover to get some tractability. Indeed, when
parameterized by $k := \text{vc}(G_1)+\text{vc}(G_2)$ the sum of the vertex
cover number of the two input graphs, the problem was shown to be
fixed-parameter tractable, with an algorithm running in time $2^{O(k \log k)}$.
We complement this result by showing that, unless the ETH fails, it cannot be
solved in time $2^{o(k \log k)}$. This kind of tight lower bound has been shown
for a few problems and parameters but, to the best of our knowledge, not for
the vertex cover number. We also show that MCIS does not have a polynomial
kernel when parameterized by $k$, unless $NP \subseteq \mathsf{coNP}/poly$.
Finally, we study MCIS and its connected variant MCCIS on some special graph
classes and with respect to other structural parameters.

through the detection of CO(1-0) line emission in the COLDz survey, through a
sensitive, Ka-band (31 to 39 GHz) VLA survey of a 6.5 square arcminute region
of the COSMOS field. We argue that the broad line (FWHM ~570 +/- 80 km/s) is
most likely to be CO(1-0) at z=2.48, as the integrated emission is spatially
coincident with an infrared-detected galaxy with a photometric redshift
estimate of z = 3.2 +/- 0.4. The CO(1-0) line luminosity is L'_CO = (2.2 +/-
0.3) x 10^{10} K km/s pc^2, suggesting a cold molecular gas mass of M_gas ~ (2
- 8)x10^{10}M_solar depending on the assumed value of the molecular gas mass to
CO luminosity ratio alpha_CO. The estimated infrared luminosity from the
(rest-frame) far-infrared spectral energy distribution (SED) is L_IR =
2.5x10^{12} L_solar and the star-formation rate is ~250 M_solar/yr, with the
SED shape indicating substantial dust obscuration of the stellar light. The
infrared to CO line luminosity ratio is ~114+/-19 L_solar/(K km/s pc^2),
similar to galaxies with similar SFRs selected at UV/optical to radio
wavelengths. This discovery confirms the potential for molecular emission line
surveys as a route to study populations of gas-rich galaxies in the future.

oriented mostly perpendicular to the velocity shear, turbulence is fed by the
disruption of a Kelvin-Helmholtz vortex chain via secondary instabilities,
vortex pairing and non-linear interactions.
  We found that the magnetic energy spectral cascade between ion and electron
inertial scales, $d_i$ and $d_e$, is in agreement with satellite observations
and other previous numerical simulations; however, in our case the spectrum
ends with a peak beyond $d_e$ due to the occurrence of the lower hybrid drift
instability. The electric energy spectrum is influenced by effects of secondary
instabilities: anomalous resistivity, fed by the development of the lower
hybrid drift instability, steepens the spectral decay and, depending on the
alignment or anti-alignment of B and the shear vorticity, peaks due to
ion-Bernstein waves may dominate the spectrum around $d_i$. These waves are
generated by counter-streaming flow structures, through flux freezing also
responsible for reconnection of the in-plane component of the magnetic field,
which then generates electron pressure anisotropy and flattening of the

and uses the stored energy to transmit data to the AP in the uplink (UL). We
consider a simple transmission policy, which accounts for the fact that, in
practice, the EH node may not have knowledge of the EH profile nor of the UL
channel state information. In particular, in each time slot, the EH node
transmits with either a constant desired power or remains silent if not enough
energy is available in its energy buffer. For this simple policy, we use the
theory of discrete-time continuous-state Markov chains to analyze the limiting
distribution of the stored energy for finite- and infinite-size energy buffers.
Moreover, we take into account imperfections of the energy buffer and the
circuit power consumption of the EH node. For a Rayleigh fading DL channel, we
provide the limiting distribution of the energy buffer content in closed form.
In addition, we analyze the average error rate and the outage probability of a
Rayleigh faded UL channel and show that the diversity order is not affected by
the finite capacity of the energy buffer. Our results reveal that, for medium

distributed random samplings (DDRS). In this paper, we further extend it to
supervised learning incrementally. The key idea here is to incorporate label
information into the coding process by reformulating that each center in DDRS
has multiple output units indicating which class the center belongs to. The
supervised learning method seems somewhat similar with random forests
(\cite{breiman2001random}), here we emphasize their differences as follows. (i)
Each layer of our method considers the relationship between part of the data
points in training data with all training data points, while random forests
focus on building each decision tree on only part of training data points
independently. (ii) Our method builds gradually-narrowed network by sampling
less and less data points, while random forests builds gradually-narrowed
network by merging subclasses. (iii) Our method is trained more straightforward
from bottom layer to top layer, while random forests build each tree from top
layer to bottom layer by splitting. (iv) Our method encodes output targets
implicitly in sparse codes, while random forests encode output targets by
remembering the class attributes of the activated nodes. Therefore, our method
is a simpler, more straightforward, and maybe a better alternative choice,

signaling molecules in plants, thus permitting long range communication within

sugar concentration between distal parts of the plant. The phloem is an
intricate distribution system, and many questions about its regulation and
structural diversity remain unanswered. Here, we investigate the phloem
structure in the simplest possible geometry: a linear leaf, found, for example,
in the needles of conifer trees. We measure the phloem structure in four tree
species representing a diverse set of habitats and needle sizes, from 1 cm
(\textit{Picea omorika}) to 35 cm (\textit{Pinus palustris}). We show that the
phloem shares common traits across these four species and find that the size of
its conductive elements obeys a power law. We present a minimal model that
accounts for these common traits and takes into account the transport strategy
and natural constraints. This minimal model predicts a power law phloem
distribution consistent with transport energy minimization, suggesting that
energetics are more important than translocation speed at the leaf level.

two-dimensional material that can be exfoliated from a bulk van der Waals
crystal. Unlike graphene it is a semiconductor with a sizeable band gap and its
excellent electronic properties make it attractive for applications in
transistor, logic, and optoelectronic devices. However, it is also the first
widely investigated two dimensional electronic material to undergo degradation
upon exposure to ambient air. Therefore a passivation method is required to
study the intrinsic material properties, understand how oxidation affects the
physical transport properties and to enable future application of phosphorene.
Here we demonstrate that atomically thin graphene and hexagonal boron nitride
crystals can be used for passivation of ultrathin black phosphorus. We report
that few-layer pristine black phosphorus channels passivated in an inert gas
environment, without any prior exposure to air, exhibit greatly improved n-type
charge transport resulting in symmetric electron and hole trans-conductance
characteristics. We attribute these results to the formation of oxygen acceptor
states in air-exposed samples which drastically perturb the band structure in

Cristelli, A. Zaccaria and L. Pietronero, Phys.

skewness and kurtosis for complex dynamical systems and identified two
power-law regimes of non-Gaussianity, one of which scales with an exponent of 2
and the other is with $4/3$. Finally the authors concluded that the observed
relation is a universal fact in complex dynamical systems. Here, we test the
proposed universal relation between skewness and kurtosis with large number of
synthetic data and show that in fact it is not universal and originates only
due to the small number of data points in the data sets considered. The
proposed relation is tested using two different non-Gaussian distributions,
namely $q$-Gaussian and Levy distributions. We clearly show that this relation
disappears for sufficiently large data sets provided that the second moment of
the distribution is finite. We find that, contrary to the claims of Cristelli
\textit{et al.} regarding a power-law scaling regime, kurtosis saturates to a
single value, which is of course different from the Gaussian case ($K=3$), as
the number of data is increased. On the other hand, if the second moment of the
distribution is infinite, then the kurtosis seems to never converge to a single
value. The converged kurtosis value for the finite second moment distributions
and the number of data points needed to reach this value depend on the
deviation of the original distribution from the Gaussian case. We also argue
that the use of kurtosis to compare distributions to decide which one deviates
from the Gaussian more can lead to incorrect results even for finite second
moment distributions for small data sets, whereas it is totally misleading for
infinite second moment distributions where the difference depends on $N$ for
all finite $N$.

the AP makes the network less clustered and more fragile. Such structural

of large clusters more strongly than the random process does. These structural
differences between the two processes are shown to be less noticeable in

to advanced life I derive expressions for the distance to putative

evolution of a civilization, Fc, and its average longevity. For instance,
assuming optimistic probability values (Fb Fc 1) and a broadcasting longevity
of a few thousand years, the likely distance to the nearest civilizations
detectable by SETI is of the order of a few thousand light years. The

Approaches that have been developed to mitigate the effects of preferential

general framework for dealing with the effects of preferential sampling in
environmental monitoring is proposed. Strategies for implementation are
proposed, leading to a method for improving the accuracy of official statistics
used to report trends and inform regulatory policy. An essential feature of the
method is its capacity to learn the preferential selection process over time

dramatic reductions in bias are possible. A case study demonstrates use of the
method in assessing the levels of air pollution due to black smoke in the UK

turbulence for Reynolds number equal to Re~25000 and Froude number respectively
of Fr~0.1 and Fr~0.03. The flows are forced at large scale and discretized on
an isotropic grid of 2048^3 points. Stratification makes the flow anisotropic
and introduces two extra characteristic scales with respect to homogeneous
isotropic turbulence: the buoyancy scale, L_B, and the Ozmidov scale, l_{oz}.
The former is related to the number of layers that the flow develops in the
direction of gravity, the latter is regarded as the scale at which isotropy is
recovered. The values of L_B and l_{oz} depend on the Froude number and their
absolute and relative size affect the repartition of energy among Fourier
modes. By contrasting the behavior of the two simulated flows we identify some
surprising similarities: after an initial transient the two flows evolve
towards comparable values of the kinetic and potential enstrophy, and energy
dissipation rate. Further similarities emerge at large scales: the same ratio
between potential and total energy (~0.1) is spontaneously selected by the
flows, and slow modes grow monotonically in both regimes causing a slow
increase of the total energy in time. The axisymmetric total energy spectrum
shows a wide variety of spectral slopes as a function of the angle between the
imposed stratification and the wave vector. One-dimensional energy spectra
computed in the direction parallel to gravity are flat from the forcing up to
buoyancy scale. At intermediate scales a ~ k^{-3} parallel spectrum develops
for the Fr ~ 0.03 run, whereas for weaker stratification, the saturation
spectrum does not have enough scales to develop and instead one observes a
power law compatible with Kolmogorov scaling. Finally, the spectrum of helicity
is flat until L_B, as observed in the nocturnal planetary boundary layer.

properties of the circumstellar gas by studying its kinematics and excitation

Keeping in mind that we studied a limited sample, we find that the physical
properties and spatial distribution of the CO gas correlate with disk geometry.
Flaring disks show highly excited CO fundamental emission up to v$_u$ = 5,
while self-shadowed disks show CO emission that is not as highly excited.
Rotational temperatures range between ~250-2000 K. The $^{13}$CO rotational
temperatures are lower than those of $^{12}$CO. The vibrational temperatures in
self-shadowed disks are similar to or slightly below the rotational
temperatures, suggesting that thermal excitation or IR pumping is important in
these lines. In flaring disks the vibrational temperatures reach as high as
6000 K, suggesting fluorescent pumping. Using a simple kinematic model we show
that the CO inner radius of the emitting region is $\approx$10 au for flaring

exists only an ensemble description, which predicts probabilities of various

for the projective collapse of the quantum state in individual experimental

important pathway for DNA repair. For this to occur, homologous genes need to
find and recognize each other. However, despite its central role in homologous
recombination, the mechanism of homology recognition is still an unsolved
puzzle. While specific proteins are known to play a role at later stages of
recombination, an initial coarse grained recognition step has been proposed.
This relies on the sequence dependence of the DNA structural parameters, such
as twist and rise, mediated by intermolecular interactions, in particular
electrostatic ones. In this proposed mechanism, sequences having the same base
pair text, or are homologous, have lower interaction energy than those
sequences with uncorrelated base pair texts; the difference termed the
recognition energy. Here, we probe how the recognition energy changes when one
DNA fragment slides past another, and consider, for the first time, homologous
sequences in antiparallel alignment. This dependence on sliding was termed the
recognition well. We find that there is recognition well for anti-parallel,
homologous DNA tracts, but only a very shallow one, so that their interaction
will differ little from the interaction between two nonhomologous tracts. This
fact may be utilized in single molecule experiments specially targeted to test
the theory. As well as this, we test previous theoretical approximations in
calculating the recognition well for parallel molecules against MC simulations,
and consider more rigorously the optimization of the orientations of the
fragments about their long axes. The more rigorous treatment affects the
recognition energy a little, when the molecules are considered rigid. However
when torsional flexibility of the DNA molecules is introduced, we find
excellent agreement between analytical approximation and simulation.

magnetic reconnection between two sets of small-scale anti-parallel loops with
an X-shaped topology. The reconnection process contains two steps: a slow step
with the duration of more than several tens of minutes, and a rapid step
lasting for only about three minutes. During the slow reconnection, two sets of
anti-parallel loops reconnect gradually, and new loops are formed and stacked
together. During the rapid reconnection, the anti-parallel loops approach each
other quickly, and then the rapid reconnection takes place, resulting in the
disappearance of former loops. In the meantime, new loops are formed and
separate. The region between the approaching loops is brightened, and the
thickness and length of this region are determined to be about 420 km and 1.4
Mm, respectively. During the rapid reconnection process, obvious brightenings
at the reconnection site and apparent material ejections outward along
reconnected loops are observed. These observed signatures are consistent with
predictions by reconnection models. We suggest that the successive slow
reconnection changes the conditions around the reconnection site and triggers
instabilities, thus leading to the rapid approach of the anti-parallel loops
and resulting in the rapid reconnection.

this paper, we relax these assumptions and present a more general statistical
framework for modeling degradation signals that may have been collected under
different types of environmental conditions. In addition, we consider
applications where the historical signals are not necessarily observed
continuously, that is, historical signals are sparse or fragmented. We consider
the case where historical degradation signals are collected under known

unknown during the acquisition of these historical data. For the first case, we
use a classification algorithm to identify the environmental state of the units
operating in the field. In the second case, a clustering step is required for
clustering the historical degradation signals. The proposed model can provide
accurate predictions of the lifetime or residual life distributions of
engineering components that are still operated in the field. This is
demonstrated by using simulated degradation signals as well as vibration-based
degradation signals acquired from a rotating machinery setup.

Einstein manifolds $(M^n,g)$, and more generally manifolds with just bounded
Ricci curvature, in the collapsed setting.
  A key tool in the regularity theory of noncollapsed Einstein manifolds is the
following: If $x\in M^n$ is such that $Vol(B_1(x))>v>0$ and that $B_2(x)$ is
sufficiently Gromov-Hausdorff close to a cone space $B_2(0^{n-\ell},y^*)\subset
\mathbb{R}^{n-\ell}\times C(Y^{\ell-1})$ for $\ell\leq 3$, then in fact
$|Rm|\leq 1$ on $B_1(x)$. No such results are known in the collapsed setting,
and in fact it is easy to see without more such results are false. It turns out
that the failure of such an estimate is related to topology. Our main theorem
is that for the above setting in the collapsed context, either the curvature is
bounded, or there are topological constraints on $B_1(x)$.
  More precisely, using established techniques one can see there exists
$\epsilon(n)$ such that if $(M^n,g)$ is an Einstein manifold and $B_2(x)$ is
$\epsilon$-Gromov-Hausdorff close to ball in

$rank(\Gamma_{\epsilon}(x))\leq n-k$. The main result of the this paper states
that if $rank(\Gamma_{\epsilon}(x))= n-k$ is maximal, then $|Rm|\leq C$ on
$B_1(x)$. In the case when the ball is close to Euclidean, this is both a
necessary and sufficient condition. There are generalizations of this result to
bounded Ricci curvature and even just lower Ricci curvature.

We used the 3D reconstructions to compute some metrics and to generate a
presentation support by using a 3D printer. This work is based on affordable
tools and illustrates how 3D technologies can be quite easily integrated in
archaeology process with limited financial resources. 1. INTRODUCTION Today,
photogrammetry and 3D modelling are an integral part of the methods used in
archeology and heritage management. They provide answers to scientific needs in
the fields of conservation, preservation, restoration and mediation of
architectural, archaeological and cultural heritage [2] [6] [7] [9].
Photogrammetry on ceramic fragments was one of the first applications
contemporary of the development of this technique applied in the archaeological
community [3]. More recently and due to its democratization, it was applied
more generally to artifacts [5]. Finally joined today by the rise of 3D
printing [8] [10], it can restore fragmented artifacts [1] [12]. These examples
target one or several particular objects and use different types of equipment
that can be expensive. These aspects can put off uninitiated archaeologists. So
it would be appropriate to see if these techniques could be generalized to a
whole class of geometrically simple and common artifacts, such as ceramics.
From these observations, associated to ceramics specialists with fragments of
broken ceramics, we aimed at arranging different tools and methods, including
photogrammetry, to explore opportunities for a cheap and attainable
reconstruction methodology and its possible applications. Our first objective
was to establish a protocol for scanning fragments with photogrammetry, and for
reconstruction of original ceramics. We used the digital reconstitutions of the
ceramics we got following our process to calculate some metrics and to design
and 3D print a display for the remaining fragments of one pottery.

Applying the theory to hard helices, we observe both right- and left-handed

unrealistic. A practical approach for modelling and estimating non-stationary
spatial dependence structure is considered. This consists in transforming a
non-stationary Random Function into a stationary and isotropic one via a
bijective continuous deformation of the index space. So far, this approach has
been successfully applied in the context of data from several independent
realizations of a Random Function. In this work, we propose an approach for
non-stationary geostatistical modelling using space deformation in the context
of a single realization with possibly irregularly spaced data. The estimation
method is based on a non-stationary variogram kernel estimator which serves as
a dissimilarity measure between two locations in the geographical space. The
proposed procedure combines aspects of kernel smoothing, weighted non-metric
multi-dimensional scaling and thin-plate spline radial basis functions. On a
simulated data, the method is able to retrieve the true deformation.
Performances are assessed on both synthetic and real datasets. It is shown in
particular that our approach outperforms the stationary approach. Beyond the
prediction, the proposed method can also serve as a tool for exploratory
analysis of the non-stationarity.

-> pi matrix elements of the chromomagnetic operator O_{CM}=g sbar sigma_{munu}
G_{munu} d, which appears in the effective Hamiltonian describing Delta S=1
transitions in and beyond the Standard Model. Having dimension 5, the
chromomagnetic operator is characterized by a rich pattern of mixing with
operators of equal and lower dimensionality. The multiplicative renormalization
factor as well as the mixing coefficients with the operators of equal dimension
have been computed at one-loop in perturbation theory. The power divergent
coefficients controlling the mixing with operators of lower dimension have been
computed non-perturbatively, by imposing suitable subtraction conditions. The
numerical simulations have been carried out using the gauge field
configurations produced by the European Twisted Mass Collaboration with
N_f=2+1+1 dynamical quarks at three values of the lattice spacing. Our
preliminary result for the B-parameter of the chromomagnetic operator is
B_{CMO}=0.29(11), which can be compared with the estimate B_{CMO}~1-4 currently
used in phenomenological analyses.

generalization performance even from small amounts of training data. However,
in a realistic scenario of multi-task learning not all tasks are equally
related to each other, hence it could be advantageous to transfer information
only between the most related tasks. In this work we propose an approach that
processes multiple tasks in a sequence with sharing between subsequent tasks
instead of solving all tasks jointly. Subsequently, we address the question of
curriculum learning of tasks, i.e. finding the best order of tasks to be
learned. Our approach is based on a generalization bound criterion for choosing
the task order that optimizes the average expected classification performance
over all tasks. Our experimental results show that learning multiple related
tasks sequentially can be more effective than learning them jointly, the order
in which tasks are being solved affects the overall performance, and that our
model is able to automatically discover the favourable order of tasks.

deviations. In this paper, we describe new tilt angle data bases derived from
the Debrecen Photoheliographic Data ($DPD$) (1974--) and from the

dichalcogenides have attracted great attention because of the rich physics and
potential applications in next-generation nano-sized electronic devices.
Recently, atomically thin black phosphorus (BP) has become a new member of the
2D materials family with high theoretical mobility and tunable bandgap
structure. However, degradation of properties under atmospheric conditions and
high-density charge traps in BP have largely limited its mobility (~400 cm2/Vs
at room temperature) and thus restricted its future applications. Here, we
report the fabrication of stable BN-BP-BN heterostructures by encapsulating
atomically thin BP between hexagonal boron nitride (BN) layers to realize
ultraclean BN-BP interfaces which allow a record-high field-effect mobility
~1350 cm2/Vs at room temperature and on-off ratios over 10^5. At low
temperatures, the mobility reaches ~2700 cm2/Vs and quantum oscillations in BP
2D hole gas are observed at low magnetic fields. Importantly, the BN-BP-BN
heterostructure can effectively avoid the quality degradation of BP in ambient
condition.

with $10^{-9} < l_X < 10^{-1}$. We find that $\Gamma$ is positively and
negatively correlated with $l_X$ when $l_X > 10^{-3}$ and $10^{-6.5} < l_X <
10^{-3}$ respectively, while $\Gamma$ is nearly a constant when $l_X <
10^{-6.5}$. We explain the above correlation in the framework of a coupled hot
accretion flow -- jet model. The radio emission always come from the jet while
the X-ray emission comes from the accretion flow and jet when $l_X$ is above
and below $10^{-6.5}$, respectively. More specifically, we assume that with the
increase of mass accretion rate, the hot accretion flow develops into a clumpy
and further a disc -- corona two-phase structure because of thermal
instability. We argue that such kind of two-phase accretion flow can explain
the observed positive correlation.

in the network, in order to analyse the effects on the dynamic range. We verify
that electrical synapses have a complementary effect on the enhancement of the

synapses, and also depends on the layer where they are distributed.

non-stationary Random Functions as a convolution of an orthogonal random
measure with a spatially varying random weighting function. This new model is a
generalization of the common convolution model where a non-random weighting
function is used. The resulting class of non-stationary covariance functions is
very general, flexible and allows to retrieve classes of closed-form
non-stationary covariance functions known from the literature, for a suitable
choices of the random weighting functions family. Under the framework of a
single realization and local stationarity, we develop parameter inference
procedure of these explicit classes of non-stationary covariance functions.
From a local variogram non-parametric kernel estimator, a weighted local
least-squares approach in combination with kernel smoothing method is developed
to estimate the parameters. Performances are assessed on two real datasets:
soil and rainfall data. It is shown in particular that the proposed approach
outperforms the stationary one, according to several criteria. Beyond the

quenches we address the transition from the strong repulsive to the
weakly-interacting regime, suppressing in this manner the heating of the
system. The excitation modes such as the cradle process and the local breathing
mode are examined via local density observables. In particular, the cradle mode
is inherently related to the initial delocalization and, following a negative
interaction quench, can be excited only for incommensurate setups with filling
larger than unity. Alternatively, a negative quench of the lattice depth which
favors the spatial delocalization is used to access the cradle mode for setups
with filling smaller than unity. Our results shed light on possible schemes to
control the cradle and the breathing modes. Finally, employing the notion of
fidelity we study the dynamical response of the system after a diabatic or

as XML data, bioinformatics and World Wide Web. The crucial step in frequent
pattern mining is frequency counting, which involves a matching operator to
find occurrences (instances) of a tree pattern in a given collection of trees.
A widely used matching operator for tree-structured data is subtree
homeomorphism, where an edge in the tree pattern is mapped onto an
ancestor-descendant relationship in the given tree. Tree patterns that are
frequent under subtree homeomorphism are usually called embedded patterns. In
this paper, we present an efficient algorithm for subtree homeomorphism with
application to frequent pattern mining. We propose a compact data-structure,
called occ, which stores only information about the rightmost paths of
occurrences and hence can encode and represent several occurrences of a tree
pattern. We then define efficient join operations on the occ data-structure,
which help us count occurrences of tree patterns according to occurrences of
their proper subtrees. Based on the proposed subtree homeomorphism method, we
develop an effective pattern mining algorithm, called TPMiner. We evaluate the
efficiency of TPMiner on several real-world and synthetic datasets. Our
extensive experiments confirm that TPMiner always outperforms well-known
existing algorithms, and in several cases the improvement with respect to
existing algorithms is significant.

Specifically, the model describes the maintenance of contrast between different
words in a language, and the elimination of such contrast when sounds in the

sounds 'i' and 'e', which distinguish pairs of words such as 'pin' and 'pen' in

pronunciation of a word as consisting of collections of labeled exemplars
stored in memory. Each exemplar is a detailed memory of a particular utterance
of the word in question. In our model an exemplar is represented by one or two
phonetic variables along with a weight indicating how strong the memory of the
utterance is. Starting from an exemplar-level model we derive
integro-differential equations for the evolution of exemplar density fields in
phonetic space. Using these latter equations we investigate under what
conditions two sounds merge, thus eliminating the contrast. Our main conclusion
is that for the preservation of phonological contrast, it is necessary that
anomalous utterances of a given word are discarded, and not merely stored in
memory as an exemplar of another word.
