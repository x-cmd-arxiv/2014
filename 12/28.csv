  energy","10 pages, 3 figures, conference: INTEGRAL 2014, Annapolis, ML, USA",,,,"astro-ph.HE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Her~X-1 is one of the most remarkable members of the class of binary X-ray
pulsars. It does not only show a large number of observable features, but has
repeatedly been the first object for which fundamental discoveries were made:
it was the first to show a super-orbital modulation, the first to reveal a
cyclotron line in its spectrum and the first in which systematic variations of
the cyclotron line energy were detected, namely variations with pulse phase (by
$\sim$ 25\%) and a positive correlation with X-ray luminosity ($\sim$ 5\%
increase for a factor of two increase in luminosity). Now we have found another
'first': a long-term decrease of the pulse phase averaged cyclotron line energy
E$_{\rm cyc}$ by $\sim$ 5\,keV in 20 years. At the time of the discovery of the
cyclotron line in 1976, its energy was $\sim$ 35\,keV, remeasured around a
similar energy by various instruments until 1990. Between 1990 and 1994 a jump
upwards beyond 41\,keV occurred, we are now back at $\sim$ 37\,keV
  With respect to the physical cause of the discovered effect, we suggest it to
be connected to a geometric displacement of the cyclotron resonant scattering
region in the polar magnetic field or due to to a true physical change in the
field configuration at the accretion mound or column by the continued
accretion. The variation with time might be due to a non-perfect equilibrium
between the rate at which material is accreted and the rate at which material
is lost at the base of the accretion mound, allowing for a variation of the
configuration of the accretion mound (height, total mass, field distribution).
We do believe that we see the signature of a local change in the field
configuration, rather than a decay of the global magnetic field, since the
observed timescale of a few decades is very short.

We here investigate the accretion of the Moon from discs generated by such
""non-canonical"" impacts, which are typically more compact than discs produced
by canonical impacts and have a higher fraction of their mass initially located
inside the Roche limit. Our model predicts a similar overall accretional
history for both canonical and non-canonical discs, with the Moon forming in
three consecutive steps over hundreds of years. However, we find that, to yield
a lunar-mass Moon, the more compact non-canonical discs must initially be more
massive than implied by prior estimates, and only a few of the discs produced
by impact simulations to date appear to meet this condition. Non-canonical
impacts require that capture of the Moon into the evection resonance with the
Sun reduced the Earth-Moon angular momentum by a factor of 2 or more. We find
that the Moon's semimajor axis at the end of its accretion is approximately
$7R_\oplus$, which is comparable to the location of the evection resonance for
a post-impact Earth with a 2.5 h rotation period in the absence of a disc.
Thus, the dynamics of the Moon's assembly may directly affect its ability to be
captured into the resonance.

management of human intervention in a natural system. These challenges are
acutely highlighted by concerns that many ecological systems may contain
tipping points, such as Allee population sizes. Before a collapse, we do not
know where the tipping points lie, if they exist at all. Hence, we know neither
a complete model of the system dynamics nor do we have access to data in some
large region of state-space where such a tipping point might exist. We
illustrate how a Bayesian Non-Parametric (BNP) approach using a Gaussian
Process (GP) prior provides a flexible representation of this inherent
uncertainty. We embed GPs in a Stochastic Dynamic Programming (SDP) framework
in order to make robust management predictions with both model uncertainty and
limited data. We use simulations to evaluate this approach as compared with the
standard approach of using model selection to choose from a set of candidate
models. We find that model selection erroneously favors models without tipping
points -- leading to harvest policies that guarantee extinction. The GPDP
performs nearly as well as the true model and significantly outperforms
standard approaches. We illustrate this using examples of simulated
single-species dynamics, where the standard model selection approach should be
most effective, and find that it still fails to account for uncertainty
appropriately and leads to population crashes, while management based on the
GPDP does not, since it does not underestimate the uncertainty outside of the

  Weakly Nonlinear Regime","ApJ Accepted",,,,"astro-ph.EP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Planets in their formative years can migrate due to the influence of
gravitational torques in the protoplanetary disk they inhabit. For low-mass
planets in an isothermal disk, it is known that there is a strong negative
torque on the planet due to its linear perturbation to the disk, causing fast
inward migration. The current investigation demonstrates that in these same
isothermal disks, for intermediate-mass planets, there is a strong positive
nonlinear corotation torque due to the effects of gas being pulled through a
gap on horseshoe orbits. For intermediate-mass planets, this positive torque
can partially or completely cancel the linear (Type I) torque, leading to
slower or outward migration, even in an isothermal disk. The effect is most
significant for Super-Earth and Sub-Jovian planets, during the transition from
a low-mass linear perturber to a non-linear gap-opening planet, when the planet
has opened a so-called 'partial gap'. In this study, numerical calculations of
planet-disk interactions calculate these torques explicitly, and scalings are
empirically constructed for migration rates in this weakly nonlinear regime.
These results find outward migration is possible for planets with masses in the
20 - 100 Earth Mass range.

known as a Cayley-Klein geometry. This construction is applicable not only to
Euclidean and non-Euclidean spaces but also to kinematic spaces (space-times).
A convenient algebraic framework for Cayley-Klein geometries called the
projective model is developed in [1, 2]. It is based on Grassmann and Clifford
algebras and provides a set of algebraic tools for modeling points, lines,
planes and their geometric transformations such as projections and isometries.
Isometry groups and their Lie algebras find a natural and intuitive expression
in the projective model. The aim of this paper is to translate the foundational
concepts of the projective model from the language of projective geometry to a
more familiar language of vector algebra and thereby facilitate its spread and
adoption among physicists and applied mathematicians. I apply the projective
model to Minkowski, de-Sitter, and anti-de-Sitter space-times in two
dimensions. In particular, I show how the action of the Poincare group can be
captured by the Clifford algebra in a uniform fashion with respect to rotations

  In our first result we show that any $n$-party $T$-round protocol on an
undirected communication network $G$ can be compiled into a robust simulation
protocol on a sparse ($\mathcal{O}(n)$ edges) subnetwork so that the simulation
tolerates an adversarial error rate of $\Omega\left(\frac{1}{n}\right)$; the
simulation has a round complexity of $\mathcal{O}\left(\frac{m \log n}{n}
T\right)$, where $m$ is the number of edges in $G$. (So the simulation is
work-preserving up to a $\log$ factor.) The adversary's error rate is within a
constant factor of optimal. Given the error rate, the round complexity blowup
is within a factor of $\mathcal{O}(k \log n)$ of optimal, where $k$ is the edge
connectivity of $G$. We also determine that the maximum tolerable error rate on
directed communication networks is $\Theta(1/s)$ where $s$ is the number of
edges in a minimum equivalent digraph.
  Next we investigate adversarial per-edge error rates, where the adversary is
given an error budget on each edge of the network. We determine the exact limit
for tolerable per-edge error rates on an arbitrary directed graph. However, the
construction that approaches this limit has exponential round complexity, so we
give another compiler, which transforms $T$-round protocols into
$\mathcal{O}(mT)$-round simulations, and prove that for polynomial-query black
box compilers, the per-edge error rate tolerated by this last compiler is
within a constant factor of optimal.

fundamental importance and exciting prospect of topological quantum
computation. However, explicit demonstration or identification of the
non-Abelian states and the associated statistics in a microscopic model is very
challenging. Here, based on density-matrix renormalization group calculation,
we provide a complete characterization of the universal properties of bosonic
Moore-Read state on Haldane honeycomb lattice model at filling number $\nu=1$
for larger systems, including both the edge spectrum and the bulk anyonic
quasiparticle (QP) statistics. We first demonstrate that there are three
degenerating ground states, for each of which there is a definite anyonic flux
threading through the cylinder. We identify the nontrivial countings for the
entanglement spectrum in accordance with the corresponding conformal field
theory. Through inserting the $U(1)$ charge flux, it is found that two of the
ground states can be adiabatically connected through a fermionic
charge-$\textit{e}$ QP being pumped from one edge to the other, while the
ground state in Ising anyon sector evolves back to itself. Furthermore, we
calculate the modular matrices $\mathcal{S}$ and $\mathcal{U}$, which contain
all the information for the anyonic QPs. In particular, the extracted quantum
dimensions, fusion rule and topological spins from modular matrices positively
identify the emergence of non-Abelian statistics following the $SU(2)_2$
Chern-Simons theory.

  Recommendation",,,,,"cs.IR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Most existing content-based filtering approaches learn user profiles
independently without capturing the similarity among users. Bayesian
hierarchical models \cite{Zhang:Efficient} learn user profiles jointly and have
the advantage of being able to borrow discriminative information from other
users through a Bayesian prior. However, the standard Bayesian hierarchical
models assume all user profiles are generated from the same prior. Considering
the diversity of user interests, this assumption could be improved by
introducing more flexibility. Besides, most existing content-based filtering
approaches implicitly assume that each user profile corresponds to exactly one
user interest and fail to capture a user's multiple interests (information
needs).
  In this paper, we present a flexible Bayesian hierarchical modeling approach
to model both commonality and diversity among users as well as individual
users' multiple interests. We propose two models each with different
assumptions, and the proposed models are called Discriminative Factored Prior
Models (DFPM). In our models, each user profile is modeled as a discriminative
classifier with a factored model as its prior, and different factors contribute
in different levels to each user profile. Compared with existing content-based
filtering models, DFPM are interesting because they can 1) borrow
discriminative criteria of other users while learning a particular user profile
through the factored prior; 2) trade off well between diversity and commonality
among users; and 3) handle the challenging classification situation where each
class contains multiple concepts. The experimental results on a dataset
collected from real users on digg.com show that our models significantly
outperform the baseline models of L-2 regularized logistic regression and
traditional Bayesian hierarchical model with logistic regression.

are formally described by the linear response theory. Besides its conventional
formulation within the quasiparticle random phase approximation (QRPA)
representing excited states as two correlated quasiparticles (2q), there exist
extensions for 4q configurations. Such extended approaches are quite successful
in the description of gross properties of nuclear spectra, however, accounting
for many of their fine features requires further extension of the configuration
space. Purpose: This work aims at the development of an approach which is
capable of such an extension as well as of reproducing and predicting fine
spectral properties, which are of special interest at low energies. Method: The
method is based on the covariant density functional theory and time blocking
approximation, which is extended for couplings between quasiparticles and
multiphonon excitations. Results: The covariant multiphonon response theory is
developed and adopted for nuclear structure calculations in medium-mass and
heavy nuclei. The equations are formulated in both general and coupled forms in
the spherical basis. Conclusions: The developed covariant multiphonon response
theory represents a new generation of the approaches to nuclear response, which
aims at a unified description of both high-frequency collective states and
low-energy spectroscopy in medium-mass and heavy nuclei.

of the wrinkling factor to the filter size and an original expression for the
active corrugating strain rate. The latter is written as a product of an
efficiency function which accounts for viscous effects and the kinematic
constraint of Peters, by a recent expression for the turbulent strain
intensity. Yields functional expressions for the fractal dimension and the
inner cut-off length scale, the latter being (i) filter-size independent and
(ii) consistent with the Damk\""ohler asymptotic behaviors at both large and
small Karlovitz numbers. A new expression for the wrinkling factor which
incorporates finite Reynolds numbers effects is further proposed. Finally, the
model is successfully assessed on an experimental filtered database.

methods of text mining, plays vital role in many management and organizing
information. Document classification is the process of assigning a document to
one or more predefined category labels. Document classification includes
different parts such as text processing, term selection, term weighting and
final classification. The accuracy of document classification is very
important. Thus improvement in each part of classification should lead to
better results and higher precision. Term weighting has a great impact on the
accuracy of the classification. Most of the existing weighting methods exploit
the statistical information of terms in documents and do not consider semantic
relations between words. In this paper, an automated document classification
system is presented that uses a novel term weighting method based on semantic

which is a generalization of Einstein's theory of gravitation. The scalar
curvature R of the spacetime, which arises in the integrand of the
Einstein-Hilbert functional, is replaced by a function f=f(R). The field
equations involve up to fourth-order derivatives of the spacetime metric, and
the challenge is to understand the structure of these high-order terms. We
propose a formulation of the initial value problem in modified gravity when the
initial data are prescribed on a hypersurface. In addition to the induced
metric and second fundamental form of the initial slice and the initial matter
content, an initial data set must also provide the spacetime scalar curvature
and its time-derivative. We introduce an augmented conformal formulation, as we
call it, in which the spacetime curvature is an independent variable. In the
so-called wave gauge, the field equations of modified gravity reduce a coupled
system of nonlinear wave-Klein-Gordon equations with defocusing potential,
whose unknowns are the conformally-transformed metric and the scalar curvature,
as well as the matter fields. We are able to establish the existence of maximal
globally hyperbolic developments when the matter is represented by a scalar
field. We analyze the so-called Jordan coupling and work with the Einstein
metric, which is conformally equivalent to the physical metric --the conformal
factor depending upon the scalar curvature. Our analysis leads us to a rigorous
validation of the theory of modified gravity. We derive quantitative estimates,
which are uniform in terms of the nonlinearity f(R), and we prove that
asymptotically flat spacetimes of modified gravity are `close' to Einstein
spacetimes, when the function f(R) in the action functional of modified gravity
is `close' to the Einstein-Hilbert integrand R.

  The main features in the article are: \begin{enumerate} \item Optimal results
about \emph{existence} and \emph{instantaneous and complete blow up} in the
linear problem $(P_0)$, where the best constant $\Lambda_{N,s}$ in the
fractional Hardy inequality provides the threshold between existence and
nonexistence. Similar results in the local heat equation were obtained by Baras
and Goldstein in \cite{BaGo}. However, in the fractional setting the arguments
are much more involved and they require the proof of a weak Harnack inequality
for a weighted operator that appear in a natural way. Once this Harnack
inequality is obtained, the optimal results follow as a simpler consequence
than in the classical case. \item The existence of a critical power
$p_+(s,\lambda)$ in the semilinear problem $(P_1)$ such that: \begin{enumerate}
\item If $p> p_+(s,\lambda)$, the problem has no weak positive supersolutions
and a phenomenon of \emph{complete and instantaneous blow up} happens. \item If
$p< p_+(s,\lambda)$, there exists a positive solution for a suitable class of
nonnegative data. \end{enumerate} \end{enumerate}

distribution with a fixed unknown mean vector that is sparse in the sense of
being nearly black. Optimality of Bayes estimates and posterior concentration
properties in terms of the minimax risk in the $l_2$ norm corresponding to a
very general class of continuous shrinkage priors are studied in this work. The
class of priors considered is rich enough to include a great variety of heavy
tailed prior distributions, such as, the three parameter beta normal mixtures
(including the horseshoe), the generalized double Pareto, the inverse gamma and
the normal-exponential-gamma priors. Assuming that the number of non-zero
components of the mean vector is known, we show that the Bayes estimators
corresponding to this general class of priors attain the minimax risk in the
$l_2$ norm (possibly up to a multiplicative constant) and the corresponding
posterior distributions contract around the true mean vector at the minimax
optimal rate for appropriate choice of the global shrinkage parameter.
Moreover, we provide conditions for which these posterior distributions
contract around the corresponding Bayes estimates at least as fast as the
minimax risk in the $l_2$ norm. We also provide a lower bound to the total
posterior variance for an important subclass of this general class of shrinkage
priors that includes the generalized double Pareto priors with shape parameter
$\alpha=0.5$ and the three parameter beta normal mixtures with parameters
$a=0.5$ and $b>0$ (including the horseshoe) in particular. The present work is
inspired by the recent work of van der Pas et al. (2014) on the posterior
contraction properties of the horseshoe prior under the present set-up. We
extend their results for this general class of priors and come up with novel
unifying proofs which work for a very broad class of one-group continuous
shrinkage priors.

accelerated electrons. Bremsstrahlung X-rays produced by, and directly related

diagnostic tool for determining both the properties of the accelerated electron
distribution, and of the flaring coronal and chromospheric plasmas. This thesis
is specifically concerned with the study of spatial, spectral and polarization
properties of solar flare X-ray sources via both modelling and X-ray
observations using the Ramaty High Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager (RHESSI).
Firstly, a new model is presented, accounting for finite temperature, pitch
angle scattering and initial pitch angle injection. This is developed to
accurately infer the properties of the acceleration region from the
observations of dense coronal X-ray sources. Moreover, examining how the
spatial properties of dense coronal X-ray sources change in time, interesting
trends in length, width, position, number density and thermal pressure are
found and the possible causes for such changes are discussed. Further analysis
of data in combination with the modelling of X-ray transport in the
photosphere, allows changes in X-ray source positions and sizes due to the
X-ray albedo effect to be deduced. Finally, it is shown, for the first time,
how the presence of a photospheric X-ray albedo component produces a spatially
resolvable polarization pattern across a hard X-ray (HXR) source. It is
demonstrated how changes in the degree and direction of polarization across a
single HXR source can be used to determine the anisotropy of the radiating
electron distribution.

such that the top-$k$-selection problem can be solved error-free with
probability $1-o(1)$ if and only if $k=o(k^*)$. A lower bound of the error when
$k=\Omega(k^*)$ is also determined, which actually is tight under some

present the results of an exact diagonalization study of an electron system in
the disk configuration including the effects of Landau level (LL) mixing and
the finite thickness of the quantum well confining the electrons. The
degeneracy between the two leading candidates for the ground state, the
Pfaffian and anti-Pfaffian, is broken by interactions with a neutralizing
background, in addition to the inclusion of two- and three-body interactions
via LL mixing. As a result of the neutralizing background in the disc
configuration, there is a phase transition from the anti-Pfaffian to the
Pfaffian as LL mixing is turned on, in stark contrast to what is observed in a
spherical geometry. The LL mixing leads to an increased charge $e/4$ quasihole
size. LL mixing interactions are also shown to overcome the effects of edge
reconstruction. Due to finite thickness effects, these properties are enhanced
dramatically. We also find that only the Pfaffian and anti-Pfaffian states
continue to possess energy gaps at finite width, while gaps for compressible
stripe states close.

emission. In most of these systems, despite detailed observational information
being available, the nature and the structure of the emitter are still poorly
known.
  Aims: We investigate the validity of the so-called one-zone approximation for
the high-energy emitter in binary systems hosting a massive star. In
particular, the case of LS 5039 is considered.
  Methods: Assuming a point-like emitter at rest, the presence of a nearby
massive star, and the observed MeV and GeV fluxes as a reference, a non-thermal
leptonic model is systematically applied for different locations, magnetic
fields, and non-radiative losses. This allows us to identify both the emitter
configurations that are most compatible with observations and inconsistencies
between model predictions and the available data.
  Results: In the case of LS 5039, the best parameter combination is fast
non-radiative cooling and a low magnetic field. However, discrepancies appear
when comparing the model results at the MeV and GeV energy ranges with the
observed fluxes. Predictions fail when the orbital motion is included in the
analysis, because emitters and energy budgets that are too large are required.
Values of X-ray and TeV fluxes that are too high are predicted in such a case,
along half of the orbit.
  Conclusions: We show that the radiation in LS 5039 does not come from only
one electron population, and the emitter is likely extended and inhomogeneous
with a low magnetic field. We suggest that the emitter moves at relativistic
velocities with Doppler boosting playing a significant role.

Many large stellar surveys have been and are still being carried
out, providing huge amounts of data, for which stellar physical parameters will
be derived. Solar twins and analogues provide a means to test the calibration
of these stellar catalogues because the Sun is the best-studied star and
provides precise fundamental parameters. Solar twins should be centred on the
solar values. Aims. This spectroscopic study of solar analogues selected from
the Geneva-Copenhagen Survey (GCS) at a resolution of 48,000 provides effective
temperatures and metallicities for these stars. We test whether our
spectroscopic parameters, as well as the previous photometric calibrations, are
properly centred on the Sun. In addition, we search for more solar twins in our
sample. Methods. The methods used in this work are based on literature methods
for solar twin searches and on methods we developed in previous work to
distinguish the metallicity-temperature degeneracies in the differential
comparison of spectra of solar analogues versus a reference solar reflection
spectrum. Results. We derive spectroscopic parameters for 148 solar analogues
(about 70 are new entries to the literature) and verify with a-posteriori
differential tests that our values are well-centred on the solar values. We use
our dataset to assess the two alternative calibrations of the GCS parameters;
our methods favour the latest revision. We show that the choice of spectral
line list or the choice of asteroid or time of observation does not affect the
results. We also identify seven solar twins in our sample, three of which are
published here for the first time. Conclusions. Our methods provide an
independent means to differentially test the calibration of stellar catalogues
around the values of a well-known benchmark star, which makes our work
interesting for calibration tests of upcoming Galactic surveys.

products of sub-amplitudes and boundary contributions with less legs, plus yet
another possible boundary contribution. In other words, the complete scattering
amplitude, including boundary contributions, can be obtained by multiple steps
of recursions, unless the boundary contributions are still non-zero when all
possible deformations are exploited. We demonstrate this algorithm by several
examples. Especially, we show that for standard model like renormalizable

a long time. However, deriving their transient analogue is a challenge as it
involves an inverse Fourier transform of the spherical Hankel functions (and
their derivatives) that are convolved with inverse Fourier transforms of
spherical Bessel functions (and their derivatives). Series expansion of these
convolutions are highly oscillatory (therefore, poorly convergent) and
unstable. Indeed, the literature on numerical computation of this convolution
is very sparse. In this paper, we present a novel quasi-analytical approach to
computing transient Mie scattering that is both stable and rapidly convergent.
The approach espoused here is to use vector tesseral harmonics as basis
function for the currents in time domain integral equations together with a
novel addition theorem for the Green's functions that renders these expansions
stable. This procedure results in an orthogonal, spatially-meshfree and
singularity-free system, giving us a set of one dimensional Volterra Integral
equations. Time-dependent multipole coefficients for each mode are obtained via
a time marching procedure. Finally, several numerical examples are presented to
show the accuracy and stability the proposed method.

O(N). We partition its space of states into the eigenspaces of the parity
transformations in the flavor space, generating the subgroup
$Z_2^{\times(N-1)}$. It is proven that the lowest-energy states in these
eigenspaces are nondegenerate and assemble in antisymmetric tensors or
pseudotensors. At the valence-bond solid point, they constitute the
$2^{N-1}$-fold degenerate ground state with fully broken parity-transformation
symmetry.

necessary and sufficient criteria for Bell nonlocality in the simplest
Bell-nonlocality scenario: 2 parties, 2 measurements per party and 2 outcomes
per measurement. Here we derive an inequality for EPR-steering that is an
analogue of the CHSH, in that it is necessary and sufficient in this same
scenario. However, since in the case of steering the device at Bob's site must
be specified (as opposed to the Bell case in which it is a black box), the
scenario we consider is that where Alice performs two (black-box) dichotomic
measurements, and Bob performs two mutually unbiased qubit measurements. We
show that this inequality is strictly weaker than the CHSH, as expected, and
use it to decide whether a recent experiment [Phys. Rev. Lett. 110, 130401
(2013).] involving a single-photon split between two parties has demonstrated
EPR-steering.

evolution of universe from inflation to late time acceleration epochs. We show
that there are two types of cylindrical wormholes. The first type is produced
at the corresponding point where k black F-strings are transited to BIon
configuration. This wormhole transfers energy from extra dimensions into our
universe, causes inflation, loses it's energy and vanishes. The second type of
cylindrical wormhole is created by a tachyonic potential and causes a new phase
of acceleration. We show that wormhole parameters grow faster than the scale
factor in this era, overtake it at ripping time and lead to the destruction of
universe at big rip singularity.

  (2011)",,,"q-bio.NC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The Memory Process, edited by Suzanne Nalbantian, Paul M. Matthews, and James
L. McClelland, is an intriguing and well-written book that provides a
groundbreaking overview of diverse approaches to understanding memory that sets
the agenda for an interdisciplinary approach to the topic. Memory has long been
a focus of investigation and interest in both the sciences and the humanities.
The way memory enriches and distorts lived experience has been widely explored
in literature and the arts. Our fascination with the subject is increasingly
evident in popular culture, with the widespread proliferation of novels and
movies in which events play out in a nonlinear fashion that reflects how
memories of them are woven together in the minds of the characters involved.
Scientific approaches to memory have focused on the study of amnesiacs,
neuroimaging studies, and cognitive studies of the formation, retrieval, and
forgetting of memories. Until now, however, humanistic and scientific
investigations of memory have been carried out independently. This book
provides an exemplary illustration of how disciplinary boundaries can be
transcended, showing how approaches to memory from the humanities and the
sciences can revitalize one another. With 19 chapters written by academics from
a range of disciplines including neuroscience, psychology, psychiatry,
cognitive science, cultural studies, philosophy, bioethics, history of science,
art, theatre, film, and literature, it is undoubtedly one of the most
interdisciplinary books on library shelves. Together these diverse perspectives
provide a broad and stimulating overview of the memory process.

Andrew Gardner, grew out of a seminar at the Institute for Archaeology at
University College London in 2007. It consists of 15 chapters by archaeologists
who self-identify themselves as practitioners who emphasize the benefits of
evolutionary or interpretive approaches to the study of the archaeological
record. While the authors' theoretical views are dichotomous, the editors' aim
for the book as a whole is not to expound on the differences between these two
kinds of archaeology but to bring forward a richer understanding of the
discipline and to highlight areas of mutual concern. Some chapters come across
as a bit of a sales pitch, but the majority of the contributions emphasize how
each approach can be productively used to address the goals of the other. The
book seeks to contribute to a mutually beneficial and more productive
discipline, and overall, it succeeds in this effort.

notion of rough sets is generalized by using an arbitrary binary relation on
attribute values in information systems, instead of the trivial equality
relation. The topology induced by binary relations is used to generalize the
basic rough set concepts. This paper studies near approximation via general
ordered topological approximation spaces which may be viewed as a
generalization of the study of near approximation from the topological view.
The basic concepts of some increasing (decreasing) near approximations,
increasing (decreasing) near boundary regions and increasing (decreasing) near
accuracy were introduced and sufficiently illustrated. Moreover, proved
results, implications and add examples.
