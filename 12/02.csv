nonlinear systems. Our current contribution is three-fold. First we present
simple algebraic conditions for establishing local convergence of non-trivial
solutions of nonlinear systems to unstable equilibria. The conditions are based
on the earlier work (A.N. Gorban, I.Yu. Tyukin, E. Steur, and H. Nijmeijer,
SIAM Journal on Control and Optimization, Vol. 51, No. 3, 2013) and can be
viewed as an extension of the Lyapunov's first method in that they apply to
systems in which the corresponding Jacobian has one zero eigenvalue. Second, we
show that for a relevant subclass of systems, persistency of excitation of a
function of time in the right-hand side of the equations governing dynamics of
the system ensure existence of an attractor basin such that solutions passing
through this basin in forward time converge to the origin exponentially.
Finally we demonstrate that conditions developed in (A.N. Gorban, I.Yu. Tyukin,

studied in homogeneous isotropic spacetime with a general choice for the dark

the holographic Ricci dark energy(RDE) model. Effect of interaction between
dark matter and dark energy on the dynamics of those models are investigated
for different popular forms of interaction. It is found that crossing of
phantom divide can be avoided in RDE models for $\beta>0.5$ irrespective of the

the unique combination of deep optical/NIR/MIR imaging provided by HST, Spitzer
and the VLT in the CANDELS-UDS, GOODS-South, and HUDF fields to determine the
GSMF over the redshift range 3.5<z<7.5. We utilised the HST WFC3/IR NIR imaging
from CANDELS and HUDF09, reaching H~27-28.5 over a total area of 369 arcmin2,
in combination with associated deep HST ACS optical data, deep Spitzer IRAC
imaging from the SEDS programme, and deep Y and K-band VLT Hawk-I images from
the HUGS programme, to select a galaxy sample with high-quality photometric
redshifts. These have been calibrated with more than 150 spectroscopic
redshifts in the range 3.5<z<7.5, resulting in an overall precision of
sigma_z/(1+z)~0.037. We have determined the low-mass end of the high-z GSMF
with unprecedented precision, reaching down to masses as low as M*~10^9 Msun at
z=4 and ~6x10^9 Msun at z=7. We find that the GSMF at 3.5<z<7.5 depends only
slightly on the recipes adopted to measure the stellar masses, namely the
photo-z, the SFHs, the nebular contribution or the presence of AGN on the
parent sample. The low-mass end of the GSMF is steeper than has been found at
lower redshifts, but appears to be unchanged over the redshift range probed
here. Our results are very different from previous GSMF estimates based on
converting UV galaxy luminosity functions into mass functions via tight M/L
relations. Integrating our evolving GSMF over mass, we find that the growth of
stellar mass density is barely consistent with the time-integral of the SFR
density over cosmic time at z>4. These results confirm the unique synergy of
the CANDELS+HUDF, HUGS, and SEDS surveys for the discovery and study of
moderate/low-mass galaxies at high redshifts.

modulation induce localization of the lattice eigenstates and block spreading

interaction between the eigenstates, which results in a slow packet spreading.
We go beyond the dissipationless limit and consider nonlinear quasi-periodic
arrays that are subjected to the dissipative losses and energy pumping. We find
that there is a finite excitation of oscillations threshold in both metallic
and insulating regimes. Moreover, excitation in the metallic and weakly
insulating regime displays features of the second order phase transition to
global oscillations, in contrast to disordered arrays. The Anderson attractor
regime is recovered only in the limit of strong localization. The identified
transition, and the further onset of chaos and synchronization can be
potentially realized with polariton condensates lattices and cavity-QED arrays.

generates intermediate subballistic superdiffusion. We derive master equations
for the cell densities with the generalized switching terms involving the

cells has an important implication for the transport process through tempering
of superdiffusive process. In the long-time limit we write stationary master
equations in terms of exponentially truncated fractional derivatives in which
the rate of death plays the role of tempering of a L\'{e}vy jump distribution.

function are the basis for calculations of numerous observables in lattice QCD.
Examples are the hadronic contributions to lepton anomalous magnetic moments,
the running of the electroweak and strong couplings and quark masses.
Quantities which are derived from the vacuum polarization tensor often involve
a summation of current correlators over all distances in position space leading
thus to the appearance of short-distance terms. The mechanism of O(a)
improvement in the presence of such short-distance terms is not directly
covered by the usual arguments of on-shell improvement of the action and the
operators for a given quantity. If such short-distance contributions appear,
the property of O(a) improvement needs to be reconsidered. We discuss the
effects of these short-distance terms on the vacuum polarization function for
twisted mass lattice QCD and find that even in the presence of such terms
automatic O(a) improvement is retained if the theory is tuned to maximal twist.

within the quasi-static framework of classical thermodynamics. First, we
consider the efficiency at maximum work (EMW) from finite source and sink
modelled as identical thermodynamic systems. The near-equilibrium regime is
characterized by expanding the internal energy upto second order (i.e. upto
linear response) in the difference of initial entropies of the source and the
sink. It is shown that the efficiency is given by a universal expression $2
\eta_C / (4-\eta_C)$, where $\eta_C$ is the Carnot efficiency. Then, different
sizes of source and sink are treated, by combining different numbers of copies
of the same thermodynamic system. The efficiency of this process is found to be
${\boldsymbol\eta}_0 = \eta_C/ (2-\gamma \eta_C)$, where the parameter $\gamma$
depends only on the relative size of the source and the sink. This implies that
within the linear response theory, EMW is bounded as ${\eta_C}/{2} \le
{{\boldsymbol\eta}}_0 \le {\eta_C}/{(2 - \eta_C)}$, where the upper (lower)
bound is obtained with a sink much larger (smaller) in size than the source. We
also remark on the behavior of the efficiency beyond linear response.

describing the formation of thermal balance, the generalized approach allows
modeling of the electromagnetic pressure and Casimir forces. We apply the

electromagnetic force density in cavities with cavity walls at different

exhibit oscillations that depend on the position as well as the photon energy.
However, the effective photon number and field temperature associated with the

the manner in which noise affects the collective behavior of self-organized
systems, specifically, has garnered considerable interest from researchers and
developers in various fields. To describe the collective motion of multiple
interacting particles, Vicsek et al. proposed a well-known self-propelled
particle (SPP) system, which exhibits a second-order phase transition from
disordered to ordered motion in simulation; due to its non-equilibrium,
randomness, and strong coupling nonlinear dynamics, however, there has been no
rigorous analysis of such a system to date. To decouple systems consisting of
deterministic laws and randomness, we propose a general method which transfers
the analysis of these systems to the design of cooperative control algorithms.
In this study, we rigorously analyzed the original Vicsek model under both open
and periodic boundary conditions for the first time, and developed extensions
to heterogeneous SPP systems (including leaderfollower models) using the
proposed method. Theoretical results show that SPP systems switch an infinite
number of times between ordered and disordered states for any noise intensity
and population density, which implies that the phase transition indeed takes a
nontraditional form. We also investigated the robust consensus and connectivity
of these systems. Moreover, the findings presented in this paper suggest that
our method can be used to predict possible configurations during the evolution
of complex systems, including turn, vortex, bifurcation and flock merger
phenomena as they appear in SPP systems.

particular astrophysical environments. We developed a numerical scheme able to
calculate thermal spectra of magnetised Page-Thorne accretion discs formed
around rotating black holes and naked singularities as seen by an arbitrary
distant observer. We incorporated two different magnetic field configurations:
uniform and dipolar, using a perturbative scheme in the coupling constant
between matter and magnetic field strength. Under the same assumptions, we
obtained observed synthetic line profiles of the 6.4 keV fluorescent iron line.
We show that an external magnetic field produces potentially observable
modifications on the thermal energy spectrum and the fluorescent iron line
profile. Thermal energy spectra of naked singularities are harder and brighter
than those from black holes, and in addition, peak and cut-off energies are
affected by the external magnetic field. Moreover, iron line profiles of slowly
rotating black holes suffer more changes by a uniform magnetic field, while
nearly extremal black holes and naked singularities are more altered in the
dipolar case. Based on our calculations, we discard the possibility of
modelling the archetypal black-hole candidate in Cygnus X-1 as a naked
singularity. Comparison of our models with observational data can be used to
probe the cosmic censorship conjecture and to estimate the existence and global

electrified relative and overall transverse perturbations of fuzzy funnel
solutions of intersecting $(N,N_f)$-strings and D5-branes in flat and
supergravity backgrounds respectively. As result the perturbations have a
discontinuity which corresponds to a zero phase shift realizing Polchinski's
open string Neumann boundary condition. And once the electric field $E$ is
turned on in flat space these perturbations decrease and when $E$ is close to
the critical value $\frac{1}{\lambda}$ the perturbations disappear forever and
the string coupling becomes strong. At this stage the space is considered
curved and the electric field is responsible for this effect. This phenomena is
also enhanced by the behavior of the potential $V$ associated to the
perturbations $\Phi$ on the funnel solutions under the influence of the
electric field. The potential goes too fast to $-\infty$ when $E$ goes to the
critical value $\frac{1}{\lambda}$ in flat space which looks like a kink to
increase the velocity for $\Phi$ to disappear. But in curved space and close to
the intersecting point we do not find any perturbation for all $E$ and there is
no effect of $E$ on $V$ and this is a sign to the absence of the perturbation
effects in supergravity background. This clarifies the existence of a relation

here to analyse complex irreversible processes such as thermoelectric (TE)
effects and thermally driven mass transport (TDMT). Complex irreversible
processes arise from the coupling effects between simple irreversible
processes. Each simple irreversible process is assiciated with an entropy or
energy density function. During complex irreversible processes with multiple
fields present, this entropy or energy density function is assumed to be
dependent on all independent field variables. Using the total entropy
functionals, the TE effects and TDMT are analysed and important kinetic
coefficients such as the Seebeck coefficient and the heat of transport are
determined with straightforward physical contents. Using the total energy
functionals, the linear irreversible processes are analysed with the Onsager
approach and the nonlinear irreversible processes with PFVA. It is found both
the Onsager's relations and the fluxes defined using PFVA guarantee the
satisfaction of the first law of thermodynamics during the process of
conversion of energies. To analyze the diffusion process under the influence of
elasticity, PFVA is also modified to incorporate the reversible evolution of
elastic fields. It is shown energies are conserved via both the irreversible
diffusion process and the reversible evolution of the elastic fields. Finally,
PFVA is generalized to study nonequilibrium thermodynamics using an extra
kinetic contribution to the entropy density function. The analyses can be
extended to a nonequilibrium thermodynamic system with multiple physical fields
present. Thus, it is believed PFVA has the potential of not only significantly
advancing our understanding of the thermodynamics of irreversible processes,
but also making thermodynamics as a discipline and the study of it truly
dynamic.

diffusive shocks, and other acceleration mechanisms. Such relativistic grains
have been suggested as primary particles of ultrahigh energy cosmic rays
(UHECRs). In this paper, we first revisit the problem of acceleration by
radiation pressure and calculate maximum grain velocities achieved. We find
that grains can be accelerated to relativistic speeds with Lorentz factor
$\gamma < 2$ by powerful radiation sources, which is lower than earlier
estimates showing that $\gamma$ could reach $\sim 10$. We then investigate
different destruction mechanisms for relativistic grains traversing a variety
of environments. In solar radiation, we find that the destruction by thermal
sublimation and Coulomb explosions is important. We also quantify grain
destruction due to electronic sputtering by ions and grain-grain collisions.
Electronic sputtering is found to be rather inefficient, whereas the
evaporation following grain-grain collisions is shown to be an important
mechanism for which the $a \sim 0.01- 1\mu$m grains would be destroyed after
sweeping a gas column $N_{Coul}\sim 5\times 10^{19}-5\times 10^{20}cm^{-2}$.
Relativistic dust in the interstellar medium and intergalactic medium (IGM)
would be disrupted by Coulomb explosions due to collisional charging after
traversing a gas column $N_{Coul} \sim 10^{17}cm^{-2}$ unless grain material is
very strong. We show that photoelectric emission by optical and ultraviolet
background radiation is also significant for the destruction of relativistic
dust in the IGM. The obtained results indicate that relativistic dust from
galaxies would be destroyed before reaching the Earth's atmosphere and unlikely
to account for UHECRs.

in size via the mechanism of inflation. The almost scale-invariant density
perturbation spectrum predicted by inflation is strongly supported by
cosmological observations, in particular the cosmic microwave background
radiation. However, the universe's precise inflationary scenario remains a
profound problem for cosmology and for fundamental physics. String theory, the
most-studied theory as the final physical theory of nature, should provide an
answer to this question. Some of the proposals on how inflation is realized in
string theory are reviewed. Since everything is made of strings, some string
loops of cosmological sizes are likely to survive in the hot big bang that
followed inflation. They appear as cosmic strings, which can have intricate
properties. Because of the warped geometry in flux compactification of the
extra spatial dimensions in string theory, some of the cosmic strings may have
tensions substantially below the Planck or string scale. Such strings cluster
in a manner similar to dark matter leading to hugely enhanced densities. As a
result, numerous fossil remnants of the low tension cosmic strings may exist
within the galaxy. They can be revealed through the optical lensing of
background stars in the near future and studied in detail through gravitational
wave emission. We anticipate that these cosmic strings will permit us to
address central questions about the properties of string theory as well as the
birth of our universe.

morphological properties of the resulting thick and thin disks.We use a model
with several new or up-dated ingredients: atomic and molecular gas phases, star
formation depending on molecular gas, yields from the recent homogeneous grid
provided by Nomoto et al. (2013), observationally inferred SNIa rates. We
describe radial migration with parametrised time- and radius-dependent
diffusion coefficients, based on the analysis of a N-body+SPH simulation. We
also consider parametrised radial gas flows, induced by the action of the
Galactic bar. Our model reproduces well the present day values of most of the
main global observables of the MW disk and bulge, and also the observed
""stacked"" evolution of MW-type galaxies from van Dokkum et al. (2013). The
azimuthally averaged radial velocity of gas inflow is constrained to less than
a few tenths of km/s. Radial migration is constrained by the observed
dispersion in the age-metallicity relation. Assuming that the thick disk is the
oldest (>9 Gyr) part of the disk, we find that the adopted radial migration
scheme can reproduce quantitatively the main local properties of the thin and
thick disk. The thick disk extends up to ~11 kpc and has a scale length of 1.8
kpc, considerably shorter than the thin disk, because of the inside-out
formation scheme. We also show how, in this framework, current and forthcoming
spectroscopic observations can constrain the nucleosynthesis yields of massive
stars for the metallicity range of 0.1 solar to 2-3 solar.

  Panels",,,,"TIIC IADC 2014 Team ID: 56.2 CMT ID: 272","cs.RO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Accumulation of dust on the surface of solar panels reduces the amount of
radiation reaching it. This leads to loss in generated electric power and
formation of hotspots which would permanently damage the solar panel. This
project aims at developing an autonomous vacuum cleaning method which can be
used on a regular basis to maximize the lifetime and efficiency of a solar
panel. This system is implemented using two subsystems namely a Robotic Vacuum
Cleaner and a Docking Station. The Robotic Vacuum Cleaner uses a two stage
cleaning process to remove the dust from the solar panel. It is designed to
work on inclined and slippery surfaces. A control strategy is formulated to
navigate the robot in the required path using an appropriate feedback
mechanism. The battery voltage of the robot is determined periodically and if
it goes below a threshold, it returns to the docking station and charges itself
automatically using power drawn from the solar panels. The operation of the
robotic vacuum cleaner has been verified and relevant results are presented.
The DC Charging circuit in the docking station is simulated in Proteus
environment and is implemented in hardware. An economical, robust Robotic
Vacuum Cleaner which can clean arrays of Solar panels (with or without
inclination) interlinked by rails and recharge itself automatically at a
docking station is designed and implemented.

kinematic Sunvaev-Zel'dovich (kSZ) effect, as a novel probe of massive
neutrinos. We find that kSZ measurements with current and upcoming surveys will
provide complementary constraints on the sum of neutrino masses from large
scale structure and will improve on Planck satellite measurements of the
primordial cosmic microwave background (CMB) and CMB lensing. Central to the
constraints is a distinctive scale dependency of the kSZ neutrino signature on
the mean pairwise momentum of clusters that we do not expect to be mirrored in
systematic effects that change the overall amplitude of the signal, like the
cluster optical depth.
  Assuming a minimal $\Lambda$CDM cosmology including massive neutrinos with
Planck primordial CMB priors combined with conservative kSZ specifications, we
forecast $68%$ upper limits on the neutrino mass sum of $290$ meV, $220$ meV,
$96$ meV for ""Stage II"" (ACTPol + BOSS), ""Stage III"" (Advanced ACTPol + BOSS),
and ""Stage IV"" (CMB-S4 + DESI) surveys respectively, compared to the Planck
alone forecast of 540 meV. These forecasts include the ability to
simultaneously constrain the neutrino mass sum and the mass-averaged optical
depth of the cluster sample in each redshift bin. If the averaged optical depth
of clusters can be measured with few percent accuracy and a lower limiting mass
is assumed, the projected kSZ constraints improve further to $120$ meV, $90$
meV and $33$ meV (Stage II, III and IV). These forecasts represent a
conservative estimate of neutrino constraints using cross-correlations of
arcminute-resolution CMB measurements and spectroscopic galaxy surveys. More
information relevant for neutrino constraints is available from these surveys,
such as galaxy clustering, weak lensing, and CMB temperature and polarization.

  information: the LBNO case at 2300 km baseline","25 pages, 20 figures",,,,"hep-ph hep-ex","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  One of the main goals of the Long Baseline Neutrino Observatory (LBNO) is to
study the $L/E$ behaviour (spectral information) of the electron neutrino and
antineutrino appearance probabilities, in order to determine the unknown
CP-violation phase $\delta_{CP}$ and discover CP-violation in the leptonic
sector. The result is based on the measurement of the appearance probabilities
in a broad range of energies, covering t he 1st and 2nd oscillation maxima, at
a very long baseline of 2300 km. The sensitivity of the experiment can be
maximised by optimising the energy spectra of the neutrino and anti-neutrino
fluxes. Such an optimisation requires exploring an extended range of parameters
describing in details the geometries and properties of the primary protons,
hadron target and focusing elements in the neutrino beam line. In this paper we
present a numerical solution that leads to an optimised energy spectra and
study its impact on the sensitivity of LBNO to discover leptonic CP violation.
In the optimised flux both 1st and 2nd oscillation maxima play an important
role in the CP sensitivity. The studies also show that this configuration is
less sensitive to systematic errors (e.g. on the total event rates) than an
experiment which mainly relies on the neutrino-antineutrino asymmetry at the
1st maximum to determine the existence of CP-violation.

understanding of how they work. We show that the many countermeasures that we
study (and their variations) actually share a number of common features, but
optimize them in different ways. We also show that there is no conceptual
distinction between test-based and infective countermeasures and how either one
can be transformed into the other. Furthermore, we show that faults on the code
(skipping instructions) can be captured by considering only faults on the data.
These intermediate results allow us to improve the state of the art in several
ways: (a) we fix an existing and that was known to be broken countermeasure
(namely the one from Shamir); (b) we drastically optimize an existing
countermeasure (namely the one from Vigilant) which we reduce to 3 tests
instead of 9 in its original version, and prove that it resists not only one
fault but also an arbitrary number of randomizing faults; (c) we also show how
to upgrade countermeasures to resist any given number of faults: given a
correct first-order countermeasure, we present a way to design a prov-able
high-order countermeasure (for a well-defined and reasonable fault model).
Finally, we pave the way for a generic approach against fault attacks for any
modular arithmetic computations, and thus for the automatic insertion of
countermeasures.

this all-optical, coherent scheme requires no additional control fields, and

semi-coherent analysis covers 10 days of LIGO S5 data ranging from 50-550 Hz,
and performs an incoherent sum of coherent $\mathcal{F}$-statistic power
distributed amongst frequency-modulated orbital sidebands. All candidates not
removed at the veto stage were found to be consistent with noise at a 1% false
alarm rate. We present Bayesian 95% confidence upper limits on
gravitational-wave strain amplitude using two different prior distributions: a
standard one, with no a priori assumptions about the orientation of Scorpius
X-1; and an angle-restricted one, using a prior derived from electromagnetic
observations. Median strain upper limits of 1.3e-24 and 8e-25 are reported at
150 Hz for the standard and angle-restricted searches respectively. This proof
of principle analysis was limited to a short observation time by unknown
effects of accretion on the intrinsic spin frequency of the neutron star, but
improves upon previous upper limits by factors of ~1.4 for the standard, and
2.3 for the angle-restricted search at the sensitive region of the detector.

$\ell_1$ trend filtering. This method generalizes 1D Total Variation (TV)
denoising for detection of step changes in means to detecting changes in
trends, and it relies on a convex optimization problem for which there are very
efficient numerical algorithms. It is known that TV denoising suffers from the
so-called stair-case effect, which leads to detecting false change points. The
objective of this paper is to show that $\ell_1$ trend filtering also suffers
from a certain stair-case problem. The analysis is based on an interpretation
of the dual variables of the optimization problem in the method as integrated
random walk. We discuss consistency conditions for $\ell_1$ trend filtering,
how to monitor their fulfillment, and how to modify the algorithm to avoid the
stair-case false detection problem.

the magnetar's radio flux density, polarization properties, pulse profile
evolution, rotation, and single-pulse behavior. We identified two main periods
of activity in SGR J1745-2900. The first is characterized by approximately 5.5
months of relatively stable evolution in radio flux density, rotation, and
profile shape, while in the second these properties varied substantially.
Specifically, a third profile component emerged and the radio flux increased on
average, but also became more variable. Bright single pulses are visible and
are well described by a log-normal energy distribution at low to moderate
energies, but with an excess at high energies. The 2-10 keV flux has decayed
steadily since the initial X-ray outburst, in contrast with the radio flux. Our
timing analysis includes Green Bank Telescope, Swift, and NuSTAR data. When we
include the X-ray data in our analyses, we find that SGR J1745-2900 exhibited a
level of timing noise unprecedented in a radio magnetar, though an analysis of
only the radio data indicates timing noise at a level similar to that observed
in other radio magnetars. We conclude that, while SGR J1745-2900 is similar to
other radio magnetars in many regards, it differs by having experienced a
period of relative stability in the radio band that now appears to have ended,
while the X-ray properties have evolved independently.

extreme complexity of the human cerebral cortex makes the hardware
implementation of neuromorphic networks with a comparable number of devices
exceptionally challenging. One of the most prospective candidates to provide
comparable complexity, while operating much faster and with manageable power
dissipation, are so-called CrossNets based on hybrid CMOS/memristor circuits.
In these circuits, the usual CMOS stack is augmented with one or several
crossbar layers, with adjustable two-terminal memristors at each crosspoint.
Recently, there was a significant progress in improvement of technology of
fabrication of such memristive crossbars and their integration with CMOS
circuits, including first demonstrations of their vertical integration.
Separately, there have been several demonstrations of discrete memristors as
artificial synapses for neuromorphic networks. Very recently such experiments
were extended to crossbar arrays of phase-change memristive devices. The
adjustment of such devices, however, requires an additional transistor at each
crosspoint, and hence the prospects of their scaling are less impressive than
those of metal-oxide memristors, whose nonlinear I-V curves enable
transistor-free operation. Here we report the first experimental implementation
of a transistor-free metal-oxide memristor crossbar with device variability
lowered sufficiently to demonstrate a successful operation of a simple
integrated neural network, a single layer-perceptron. The network could be
taught in situ using a coarse-grain variety of the delta-rule algorithm to
perform the perfect classification of 3x3-pixel black/white images into 3
classes. We believe that this demonstration is an important step towards the
implementation of much larger and more complex memristive neuromorphic
networks.

the electrical resistance of samples at high pressures (0-6GPa) and high
temperatures (300-1000K) in a 'Paris-Edinburgh' type large volume press.
Uniquely, the electrical measurements are carried out directly on a small
sample, thus greatly increasing the sensitivity of the measurement. The
sensitivity to even minor changes in electrical resistance can be used to
clearly identify phase transitions in material samples. Electrical resistance
measurements are relatively simple and rapid to execute and the efficacy of the
present experimental design is demonstrated by measuring the electrical
resistance of Pb, Sn and Bi across a wide domain of temperature-pressure phase
space and employing it to identify the loci of phase transitions. Based on
these results, the phase diagrams of these elements are reconstructed to high
accuracy and found to be in excellent agreement with previous studies. In
particular, by mapping the locations of several well-studied reference points
in the phase diagram of Sn and Bi, it is demonstrated that a standard
calibration exists for the temperature and pressure, thus eliminating the need
for direct or indirect temperature and pressure measurements. The present
technique will allow simple and accurate mapping of phase diagrams under
extreme conditions and may be of particular importance in advancing studies of
liquid state anomalies.

discrete labels; conditioned on these two labels, the signal of interest and
side information are drawn from a multivariate Gaussian distribution. With
joint probabilities on the latent labels, the overall signal-(side information)
representation is defined by a Gaussian mixture model. We then provide sharp
sufficient and/or necessary conditions for these quantities to approach zero
when the covariance matrices of the Gaussians are nearly low-rank. These
conditions, which are reminiscent of the well-known Slepian-Wolf and Wyner-Ziv
conditions, are a function of the number of linear features extracted from the
signal of interest, the number of linear features extracted from the side
information signal, and the geometry of these signals and their interplay.
Moreover, on assuming that the signal of interest and the side information obey
such an approximately low-rank model, we derive expansions of the
reconstruction error as a function of the deviation from an exactly low-rank
model; such expansions also allow identification of operational regimes where
the impact of side information on signal reconstruction is most relevant. Our
framework, which offers a principled mechanism to integrate side information in
high-dimensional data problems, is also tested in the context of imaging
applications.

variant of the nonlinear Schr{\""o}dinger equation under the impact of external

to the formation of vortices. We show, however, that the most unstable mode
leading to this instability scales with an appropriate power of the chemical
potential $\mu$ of the system, increasing proportionally to $\mu^{2/3}$. The
precise form of the relevant formula, obtained through our asymptotic analysis,
provides the most unstable mode as a function of the atomic density and the
trap strength. We show how these unstable modes typically nucleate a large
number of vortices in the periphery of the atomic cloud. However, through a
pattern selection mechanism, prompted by symmetry-breaking, only few isolated
vortices are pulled in sequentially from the periphery towards the bulk of the
cloud resulting in highly symmetric stable vortex configurations with far fewer
vortices than the original unstable mode. These results may be of relevance to
the experimentally tractable realm of finite temperature atomic condensates.

NP-hard and numerically ill-posed in general. Even the best rank-1
approximation of a tensor is NP-hard. In this paper, we use convex optimization
to develop polynomial-time algorithms for low-rank approximation and completion
of positive tensors. Our approach is to use algebraic topology to define a new
(numerically well-posed) decomposition for positive tensors, which we show is
equivalent to the standard tensor decomposition in important cases. Though
computing this decomposition is a nonconvex optimization problem, we prove it
can be exactly reformulated as a convex optimization problem. This allows us to
construct polynomial-time randomized algorithms for computing this
decomposition and for solving low-rank tensor approximation problems. Among the
consequences is that best rank-1 approximations of positive tensors can be
computed in polynomial time. Our framework is next extended to the tensor
completion problem, where noisy entries of a tensor are observed and then used
to estimate missing entries. We provide a polynomial-time algorithm that for
specific cases requires a polynomial (in tensor order) number of measurements,
in contrast to existing approaches that require an exponential number of
measurements. These algorithms are extended to exploit sparsity in the tensor

previous 24-variable version by adding a dynamical equation for the passive
advection of temperature in the ocean, together with an energy balance model.
  The bifurcation analysis and the numerical integration of the model reveal
the presence of low-frequency variability (LFV) concentrated on and near a
long-periodic, attracting orbit. This orbit combines atmospheric and oceanic
modes, and it arises for large values of the meridional gradient of radiative
input and of frictional coupling. Chaotic behavior develops around this orbit
as it loses its stability; this behavior is still dominated by the LFV on
decadal and multi-decadal time scales that is typical of oceanic processes.
Atmospheric diagnostics also reveals the presence of predominant low- and
high-pressure zones, as well as of a subtropical jet; these features recall
realistic climatological properties of the oceanic atmosphere.
  Finally, a predictability analysis is performed. Once the decadal-scale
periodic orbits develop, the coupled system's short-term instabilities --- as
measured by its Lyapunov exponents --- are drastically reduced, indicating the
ocean's stabilizing role on the atmospheric dynamics. On decadal time scales,
the recurrence of the solution in a certain region of the invariant subspace
associated with slow modes displays some extended predictability, as reflected
by the oscillatory behavior of the error for the atmospheric variables at long
lead times.

color-Teff relations of variations of the initial chemical composition, and of
the evolution off the zero age horizontal branch. As a test case, we applied

solving coupled ordinary differential equation (ODE) systems for irradiation

the variable space that renders traditional ODE-based RT approaches inefficient
when handling complex defect population comprised of multiple (more than two)
defect species. Several improvements introduced here enable efficient and
accurate simulations of irradiated materials up to realistic (high) damage

is a procedure for efficiently updating the defect reaction-network and event
selection in the context of a dynamically expanding reaction-network. Next is a
novel implementation of the $\tau$-leaping method that speeds up SCD
simulations by advancing the state of the reaction network in large time
increments when appropriate. Lastly, a volume rescaling procedure is introduced
to control the computational complexity of the expanding reaction-network
through occasional reductions of the defect population while maintaining
accurate statistics. The enhanced SCD method is then applied to model defect
cluster accumulation in iron thin films subjected to triple ion-beam

ecosystem is becoming a challenging issue, and wireless virtualization emerges
as an efficient solution. Although the inclusion of virtualization in wireless
networks ensures a better use of resources, current approaches adopted for
wireless virtualization can cause an underutilization of resources, since the
resource allocated to a virtual wireless network is not shared with other one.
This problem can be overcome by combining wireless virtualization with the
cognitive radio (CR) technology and dynamic access spectrum (DSA) techniques.
Thus, virtual wireless networks with different access priorities to resources
(e.g., primary and secondary) can be deployed in an overlay form and share the
same substrate wireless network, where the secondary networks use the resources
opportunistically. However, challenges emerge in this new scenario, ranging
from the mapping to the operation of these networks. This paper is the first to
propose the cognitive radio virtual network environment and to formulate the
problem of mapping the secondary virtual networks (SVNs) onto the wireless
substrate network based on CR. To this end, a multi-objective formulation is
designed. Moreover, an analysis of the metrics defined in the problem is
performed in order to give the reader useful assistance in designing schemes to
solve the problem of mapping SVNs onto substrate networks.

Asymptotic and numerical assessment reveals that, under weak dependence, the

constrains the faint end slope of the luminosity function to -2.35 < $\alpha$ <

quasar continuum diversity and high-density absorbers, instrumental effects
such as noise and spectral resolution, as well as imperfections introduced by
the SDSS pipeline treatment of the raw data. The Ly{\alpha} forest BAO analysis
of the BOSS collaboration, described in Delubac et al. 2014, has used these
mock data-sets to develop and cross-check analysis procedures prior to
performing the BAO analysis on real data, and for continued systematic cross

stars is the suppression of the diffracted halo from the primary star.
Coronagraphs are angular filters that suppress this diffracted halo. The
Apodizing Phase Plate coronagraph modifies the pupil-plane phase with an
anti-symmetric pattern to suppress diffraction over a 180 degree region from 2
to 7 {\lambda}/D and achieves a mean raw contrast of 10^-4 in this area,
independent of the tip-tilt stability of the system. Current APP coronagraphs
implemented using classical phase techniques are limited in bandwidth and
suppression region geometry (i.e. only on 1 side of the star). In this paper,
we show the vector-APP (vAPP) whose phase pattern is implemented by the
orientation of patterned liquid crystals. Beam-splitting according to circular
polarization states produces two, complementary PSFs with dark holes on either
side. We have developed a prototype vAPP that consists of a stack of 3 twisting
liquid crystal layers with a bandwidth of 500-900 nm. We characterize the
properties of this device using reconstructions of the pupil-plane pattern, and
of the ensuing PSF structures. By imaging the pupil between crossed and
parallel polarizers we reconstruct the fast axis pattern, transmission, and
retardance of the vAPP, and use this as input for a PSF model. This model
includes aberrations of the laboratory set-up, and matches the measured PSF,
which shows a raw contrast of 10^-3.8 between 2 and 7 {\lambda}/D in a 135
degree wedge. The vAPP coronagraph is relatively easy to manufacture and can be
implemented together with a broadband quarter-wave plate and Wollaston prism in
a pupil wheel in high-contrast imaging instruments. The manufacturing
techniques permit the application of phase patterns with deeper contrasts
inside the dark holes and enables unprecedented spectral bandwidths for
phase-manipulation coronagraphy.

measured using some evolving virial relation, but recent work suggests that
most halo growth at late cosmic time (z < 2) is not physical but is rather the
by-product of an evolving virial radius (""pseudo-evolution""). Using Omega25, a
suite of cosmological simulations that incorporate both dark matter and gas
dynamics with differing treatments of gas cooling, star formation, and thermal
feedback, we systematically explore the physics that governs cosmic accretion
into halos and their galaxies. Physically meaningful cosmic accretion of both
dark matter and baryons occurs at z > 1 across our halo mass range: M_200m =
10^{11-14} M_sun. However, dark matter, because it is dissipationless, is
deposited (in a time-average sense) at > R_200m(z) in a shell-like manner, such
that dark-matter mass and density experience little-to-no physical growth at
any radius within a halo at z < 1. In contrast, gas, because it is able to cool
radiatively, experiences significant accretion at all radii, at a rate that
roughly tracks the accretion rate at R_200m, at all redshifts. Infalling gas
starts to decouple from dark matter at ~2 R_200m and continues to accrete to
smaller radii until the onset of strong angular-momentum support at ~ 0.1
R_200m. Thus, while the growth of dark matter is subject to pseudo-evolution,
the growth of baryons is not. The fact that the accretion rate of gas on
galactic scales tracks the accretion rate near R_200m provides insight into the
tight relations between the masses/sizes of galaxies and those of their host
halos across cosmic time.

the efficient search for [C II] in z~7 galaxies with sub-mm instruments such as
ALMA, given their limited scan speed for faint lines. One means by which to
improve the precision of the inferred redshifts is to exploit the potential
impact of strong nebular emission lines on the colors of z~4-8 galaxies as
observed by Spitzer/IRAC. At z~6.8, galaxies exhibit IRAC colors as blue as
[3.6]-[4.5] ~-1, likely due to the contribution of [O III]+Hb to the 3.6 mum
flux combined with the absence of line contamination in the 4.5 mum band. In
this paper we explore the use of extremely blue [3.6]-[4.5] colors to identify
galaxies in the narrow redshift window z~6.6-6.9. When combined with an
I-dropout criterion, we demonstrate that we can plausibly select a relatively
clean sample of z~6.8 galaxies. Through a systematic application of this
selection technique to our catalogs from all five CANDELS fields, we identify
20 probable z~6.6-6.9 galaxies. We estimate that our criteria select the ~50%
strongest line emitters at z~6.8 and from the IRAC colors we estimate a typical
[O III]+Hb rest-frame equivalent width of 1085A for this sample. The small
redshift uncertainties on our sample make it particularly well suited for
follow-up studies with facilities such as ALMA.

absolute-time sequence of star-forming clouds. In this paper, we present an
orbital model for the gas stream(s) observed in the CMZ. The model is obtained
by integrating orbits in the observed gravitational potential and represents a
good fit to the distribution of dense gas, reproducing all of its key
properties. The orbit is also consistent with observational constraints not
included in the fitting process, such as the velocities of Sgr B2 and the
Arches and Quintuplet clusters. It differs from previous models: (1) the orbit
is open rather than closed due to the extended mass distribution in the CMZ,
(2) its orbital velocity is twice as high as in previous models, and (3) Sgr
A$^*$ coincides with the focus of the (eccentric) orbit rather than being
offset. Our orbital solution supports the scenario in which the dust ridge
between G0.253+0.016 ('the Brick') and Sgr B2 represents an absolute-time
sequence of star-forming clouds, triggered by the tidal compression during
their recent pericentre passage. We position the clouds on a common timeline
and find that their pericentre passages occurred 0.30-0.74 Myr ago. Given their
short free-fall times (0.3-0.4 Myr), the quiescent cloud G0.253+0.016 and the
vigorously star-forming complex Sgr B2 are separated by a single free-fall time
of evolution, implying that star formation proceeds rapidly once collapse has
been initiated. We provide several quantitative predictions of our model and
conclude with a discussion of the model in the Galactic context, highlighting
its relation to large-scale gas accretion, the dynamics of the bar, the $x_2$

associated scalar emission completely dominates the zero-point fluctuations of
inflaton, resulting in a tensor-to-scalar ratio $r\sim \epsilon^2$. A more
quantitative result can be obtained if one further assumes that gravitational
waves are emitted by localized sub-horizon processes, giving $r_{\rm max}
\simeq 0.3 \epsilon^2$. However, $\epsilon$ is generally time dependent, and
this result for $r$ depends on its instantaneous value during the production of
the sources, rather than just its average value, somewhat relaxing constraints
from the tilt $n_s$. We calculate the scalar 3-point correlation function in
the same class of models and show that non-Gaussianity cannot be made
arbitrarily small, i.e. $f_{NL} \geq 1$, independently of the value of $r$.

verifying that the true degrees of freedom of gravity may conveniently be
represented by the conformal structure it is shown first that regardless
whether the primary space is Riemannian or Lorentzian, in terms of the chosen
geometrically distinguished new variables, the $1+n$ momentum constraint can be
written as a first order symmetric hyperbolic system. It is also argued that in

reality of the quantum state by ruling out {\psi}-epistemic ontological
theories, in which the quantum state is of a statistical nature. It applies
under an assumption of preparation independence, the validity of which has been
subject to debate. We propose two plausible and less restrictive alternatives:
a weaker notion allowing for classical correlations, and an even weaker,
physically motivated notion of independence, which merely prohibits the
possibility of superluminal causal influences in the preparation process. The
latter is a minimal requirement for enabling a reasonable treatment of
subsystems in any theory. It is demonstrated by means of an explicit
{\psi}-epistemic ontological model that the argument of PBR becomes invalid
under the alternative notions of independence. As an intermediate step, we
recover a result which is valid in the presence of classical correlations.
Finally, we obtain a theorem which holds under the minimal requirement,
approximating the result of PBR. For this, we consider experiments involving
randomly sampled preparations and derive bounds on the degree of {\psi}
epistemicity that is consistent with the quantum-mechanical predictions. The
approximation is exact in the limit as the sample space of preparations becomes
infinite.

facilitating self-induced flavor conversion. On the other hand, below the

multi-angle matter effects, preventing any impact of flavor conversion on SN

impact of modified $\bar\nu_e$-$\nu_e$ flux asymmetries on collective flavor
conversion. In the parameter space consisting of matter density and effective
neutrino density, the region of instability with regard to self-induced flavor
conversion is much larger for a vanishing lepton number flux, yet this

spectral index $-4$ in momentum space, in agreement with the prediction of DSA.
We find that scattering of both protons and electrons is mediated by
right-handed circularly polarized waves excited by the current of energetic
protons via non-resonant hybrid (Bell) instability. Protons are injected into
DSA after a few gyro-cycles of shock drift acceleration (SDA), while electrons
are first pre-heated via SDA, then energized via a hybrid acceleration process
that involves both SDA and Fermi-like acceleration mediated by Bell waves,
before eventual injection into DSA. Using the simulations we can measure the
electron/proton ratio in accelerated particles, which is of paramount
importance for explaining the cosmic ray fluxes measured at Earth and the
multi-wavelength emission of astrophysical objects such as supernova remnants,
radio supernovae, and galaxy clusters. We find the normalization of electron
power-law is $\lesssim 10^{-2}$ that of the protons for strong nonrelativistic
shocks.

oblique pulsar magnetosphere with pair formation. The magnetosphere starts to
form with particles extracted from the surface of the neutron star. These
particles are accelerated by surface electric fields and emit photons capable
of producing electron-positron pairs. We inject secondary pairs at locations of
primary energetic particles, whose energy exceeds the threshold for pair
formation. We find solutions that are close to the ideal force-free
magnetosphere, with the Y-point and current sheet. Solutions with obliquities
$\lt 40^{\circ}$ do not show pair production in the open field line region,
because the local current density along magnetic field is below the
Goldreich-Julian value. The bulk outflow in these solutions is charge
separated, and pair formation happens in the current sheet and return current
layer only. Solutions with higher inclinations show pair production in the open
field line region, with high multiplicity of the bulk flow and the size of
pair-producing region increasing with inclination. We observe the spin-down of
the star to be comparable to MHD model predictions. The magnetic dissipation in
the current sheet ranges between 20% for the aligned rotator and 3% for the
orthogonal rotator. Our results suggest that for low obliquity neutron stars
with suppressed pair formation at the light cylinder, the presence of phenomena
related to pair activity in the bulk of the polar region, e.g., radio emission,
may crucially depend on the physics beyond our simplified model, such as the
effects of curved space-time or multipolar surface fields.

""Tatooines"", which appear to be well aligned with their host stars' orbits.
Whether this alignment is due to initially coplanar circumbinary planet-forming
discs (i.e. nature), or subsequent alignment of initially misaligned discs by
warping the inner disc or torquing the binary (i.e. nurture), is not known.
Tests of which scenario dominates may be possible by observing circumbinary
Kuiper belt analogues (""debris discs""), which trace the plane of the primordial
disc. Here, the 140 au diameter circumbinary debris disc around HD 131511 is
shown to be aligned to within 10$^\circ$ of the plane of the near edge-on 0.2
au binary orbit. The stellar equator is also consistent with being in this
plane. If the primordial disc was massive enough to pull the binary into
alignment, this outcome should be common and distinguishing nature versus
nurture will be difficult. However, if only the inner disc becomes aligned with
the binary, the HD 131511 system was never significantly misaligned. Given an
initial misalignment, the $\sim$Gyr main-sequence lifetime of the star allows
secular perturbations to align the debris disc out to 100 au at the cost of an
increased scale height. The observed debris disc scale height limits any
misalignment to less than 25$^\circ$. With only a handful known, many more such
systems need to be characterised to help test whether the alignment of
circumbinary planets is nature or nurture.

Our strategy is to compare MESs of three independent entanglement bipartitions

determines it. Our method applies equally to Abelian and non-Abelian

  Models",,,,,"stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In theory, Bayesian nonparametric (BNP) models are well suited to streaming
data scenarios due to their ability to adapt model complexity with the observed
data. Unfortunately, such benefits have not been fully realized in practice;
existing inference algorithms are either not applicable to streaming
applications or not extensible to BNP models. For the special case of Dirichlet
processes, streaming inference has been considered. However, there is growing
interest in more flexible BNP models building on the class of normalized random
measures (NRMs). We work within this general framework and present a streaming
variational inference algorithm for NRM mixture models. Our algorithm is based
on assumed density filtering (ADF), leading straightforwardly to expectation
propagation (EP) for large-scale batch inference as well. We demonstrate the
efficacy of the algorithm on clustering documents in large, streaming text
corpora.

micron imaging survey of 50 nearby dwarf galaxies designed to identify
dust-producing Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) stars and massive stars. Using two
epochs, spaced approximately six months apart, we identify a total of 526 dusty
variable AGB stars (sometimes called ""extreme"" or x-AGB stars; [3.6]-[4.5]>0.1
mag). Of these, 111 are in galaxies with [Fe/H] < -1.5 and 12 are in galaxies
with [Fe/H] < -2.0, making them the most metal-poor dust-producing AGB stars
known. We compare these identifications to those in the literature and find
that most are newly discovered large-amplitude variables, with the exception of
approximately 30 stars in NGC 185 and NGC 147, one star in IC 1613, and one
star in Phoenix. The chemical abundances of the x-AGB variables are unknown,
but the low metallicities suggest that they are more likely to be carbon-rich
than oxygen-rich and comparisons with existing optical and near-IR photometry
confirms that 70 of the x-AGB variables are confirmed or likely carbon stars.
We see an increase in the pulsation amplitude with increased dust production,
supporting previous studies suggesting that dust production and pulsation are
linked. We find no strong evidence linking dust production with metallicity,
indicating that dust can form in very metal-poor environments.

recently to exhibit a wealth of remarkable features when size disparity or
mixture's composition is varied. In this paper, we test whether or not similar
dynamical phenomena occur in glassy systems composed of binary hard ellipses.
We demonstrate via event-driven molecular dynamics simulation that a binary
hard-ellipse mixture with an aspect ratio of two and moderate size disparity
displays characteristic glassy dynamics upon increasing density in both the
translational and the rotational degrees of freedom. The rotational glass
transition density is found to be close to the translational one for the binary
mixtures investigated. More importantly, we assess the influence of size
disparity and mixture's composition on the relaxation dynamics. We find that an
increase of size disparity leads, both translationally and rotationally, to a
speed up of the long-time dynamics in the supercooled regime so that both the
translational and the rotational glass transition shift to higher densities. By
increasing the number concentration of the small particles, the time evolution
of both translational and rotational relaxation dynamics at high densities
displays two qualitatively different scenarios, i.e., both the initial and the
final part of the structural relaxation slow down for small size disparity,
while the short-time dynamics still slows down but the final decay speeds up in
the binary mixture with large size disparity. These findings are reminiscent of
those observed in binary hard spherical particles. Therefore, our results
suggest a universal mechanism for the influence of size disparity and mixture's
composition on the structural relaxation in both isotropic and anisotropic
particle systems.

emission between 1100 \AA\, and $\sim$580 \AA\, is generally considered to be
associated with the innermost regions of the accretion flow onto the central

the result of islands of large scale magnetic flux in RLQs that are located
close to the central black hole that remove energy from the accretion flow as
Poynting flux (sometimes called magnetically arrested accretion). These
magnetic islands are natural sites for launching relativistic jets. Based on
the Telfer et al. data and the numerical simulations of accretion flows in
Penna et al., the magnetic islands are concentrated between the event horizon

boundary to the quark-gluon plasma. We argue that the trace-anomaly peak and
the local minimum of the generalized specific volume observed at a laboratory
energy of 11.6 AGeV provide a signal for the formation of a mixed phase between
the quark-gluon plasma and the hadron phase. This naturally explains the change
of slope in the energy dependence of the yield of lambda hyperons per proton at
a laboratory energy of 8.6 GeV.

Global mangrove deforestation continues but at a much reduced rate of between
0.16 percent and 0.39 percent annually. Southeast Asia is a region of concern
with mangrove deforestation rates between 3.58 percent and 8.08 percent during
the analysis period, this in a region containing half of the entire global

essentially stable, with the exception of the largest mangrove-holding region
of Southeast Asia. We provide a standardized global spatial dataset that
monitors mangrove deforestation globally at high spatiotemporal resolutions,
covering 99 percent of all mangrove forests. These data can be used to drive
the mangrove research agenda particularly as it pertains to improved monitoring
of mangrove carbon stocks and the establishment of baseline local mangrove
forest inventories required for payment for ecosystem service initiatives.

include stochastic differential equations with reflection and the so-called
submartingale problem. We introduce a general formulation of the submartingale
problem for (obliquely) reflected diffusions in domains with piecewise C^2
boundaries and piecewise continuous reflection vector fields. Under suitable
assumptions, we show that well-posedness of the submartingale problem is
equivalent to existence and uniqueness in law of weak solutions to the
corresponding stochastic differential equation with reflection. Our result
generalizes to the case of reflecting diffusions a classical result due to
Stroock and Varadhan on the equivalence of well-posedness of martingale
problems and well-posedness of weak solutions of stochastic differential
equations in d-dimensional Euclidean space. The analysis in the case of
reflected diffusions in domains with non-smooth boundaries is considerably more
subtle and requires a careful analysis of the behavior of the reflected
diffusion on the boundary of the domain. In particular, the equivalence can
fail to hold when our assumptions are not satisfied. The equivalence we
establish allows one to transfer results on reflected diffusions characterized
by one approach to reflected diffusions analyzed by the other approach. As an
application, we provide a characterization of stationary distributions of a
large class of reflected diffusions in convex polyhedral domains.

determined by $J$. However, the proportionality constant is not the same on

exists with a complex frequency dependence. The analysis of the observed
behavior within the SkL phase indicates a distribution of relaxation times
intrinsically related to SkL. At the SkL-to-paramagnet transition a narrow
first-order peak is found that exhibits a strong frequency and magnetic field
dependence. Surprisingly, very similar dependence has been discovered for the
first-order transition below the SkL phase, i.e. where the system enters the
helical and conical state(s), indicating similar processes across the
order-disorder transition.

the possibility of such a transition by using the mean-field approximation for
the ground state of the periodic Anderson model. After clarifying the parameter
region in which the double-Q (triple-Q) state is stabilized on the square

minimizes the sample within cluster sum of squares under an~$\ell_1$ fusion

gaining in popularity, however, its asymptotic properties have remained mostly
unknown. Our analysis is based on a novel representation of the sample
clustering procedure as a sequence of cluster splits determined by a sequence
of maximization problems. We use this representation to provide a simple and
intuitive formulation for the population clustering procedure. We then
demonstrate that the sample procedure consistently estimates its population
analog, and derive the corresponding rates of convergence. The proof conducts a
careful simultaneous analysis of a collection of M-estimation problems, whose
cardinality grows together with the sample size. Based on the new perspectives
gained from the asymptotic investigation, we propose a key post-processing
modification of the original clustering framework. We show, both theoretically
and empirically, that the resulting approach can be successfully used to
estimate the number of clusters in the population. Using simulated data, we
compare the proposed method with existing number of clusters and modality
assessment approaches, and obtain encouraging results. We also demonstrate the

function (ERDF) allows us to clearly disentangle the active galactic nuclei
(AGN) downsizing phenomenon, present in the AGN luminosity function, into its
physical processes of black hole mass downsizing and accretion rate evolution.
We are utilizing type-1 AGN samples from three optical surveys (VVDS, zCOSMOS

interval of interest. We investigate the cosmic evolution of the AGN population

consistent with downsizing in black hole mass. The active fraction or duty
cycle of type-1 AGN at z~1.5 is almost flat as a function of black hole mass,
while it shows a strong decrease with increasing mass at z=0. We are witnessing
a phase of intense black hole growth, which is largely driven by the onset of
AGN activity in massive black holes towards z=2. We finally compare our results

agreement over certain parameter ranges, we highlight the need to refine these

defined through a rigid or a soft geometric rule, the method reduces to a non
trivial satisfaction problem: Given $N$ nodes, a domain $\mathcal{D}$, and a
desired average connectivity $\langle k\rangle$, find - if any - the
distribution of nodes having support in $\mathcal{D}$ and average connectivity
$\langle k\rangle$. We find out that, in the thermodynamic limit, nodes are
either uniformly distributed or highly condensed in a small region, the two
regimes being separated by a first order phase transition characterized by a
$\mathop{O}(N)$ jump of $\langle k\rangle$. Other intermediate values of
$\langle k\rangle$ correspond to very rare graph realizations. The phase
transition is observed as a function of a parameter $a\in[0,1]$ that tunes the
underlying geometry. In particular, $a=1$ indicates a rigid geometry where only
close nodes are connected, while $a=0$ indicates a rigid anti-geometry where
only distant nodes are connected. Consistently, when $a=1/2$ there is no
geometry and no phase transition. After discussing the numerical analysis, we
provide a combinatorial argument to fully explain the mechanism inducing this
phase transition and recognize it as an easy-hard-easy transition. Our result
shows that, in general, ad hoc optimized networks can hardly be designed,

simulations on a grid of 91 cosmological models, covering broad ranges of the
three parameters $\Omega_m$, $\sigma_8$, and $w$, and replicating the Galaxy
sky positions, redshifts, and shape noise in the CFHTLenS observations. We then
build an emulator that interpolates the power spectrum and the peak counts to
an accuracy of $\leq 5\%$, and compute the likelihood in the three-dimensional
parameter space ($\Omega_m$, $\sigma_8$, $w$) from both observables. We find
that constraints from peak counts are comparable to those from the power
spectrum, and somewhat tighter when different smoothing scales are combined.
Neither observable can constrain $w$ without external data. When the power
spectrum and peak counts are combined, the area of the error ""banana'' in the
($\Omega_m$, $\sigma_8$) plane reduces by a factor of $\approx2$, compared to
using the power spectrum alone. For a flat $\Lambda$ cold dark matter model,
combining both statistics, we obtain the constraint

explain dark matter phenomena on both large and small scales. In this
framework, the dark matter halo in spiral galaxies features nontrivial
dynamics, with the halo energy loss due to dissipative interactions balanced by
a heat source. Ordinary supernovae can potentially supply this heat provided
kinetic mixing interaction exists with strength $\epsilon \sim 10^{-9}$. This
type of kinetically mixed dark matter can be probed in direct detection
experiments. Importantly, this self-interacting dark matter can be captured
within the Earth and shield a dark matter detector from the halo wind, giving
rise to a diurnal modulation effect. We estimate the size of this effect for
detectors located in the Southern hemisphere, and find that the modulation is
large ($\gtrsim 10\%$) for a wide range of parameters.

trick, the single interval R\'enyi entropy of 2D CFT at finite temperature
could be read from the partition function on $n$-sheeted torus connected with
each other along a branch cut. We calculate the partition function by inserting
a complete basis across the branch cut. Because of the monodromy condition
across the branch cut in the large interval limit, the basis of the states
should be the ones in the twist sector. We study the twist sector of a general
module of CFT and find that there is an one-to-one correspondence between the
twist sector states and the normal sector states. As an application, we revisit
the non-compact free scalar theory and discuss the large interval limit of the
R\'enyi entropy of this theory by using our proposal. We find complete
agreement in the leading and next-leading orders with direct expansion of the
exact partition function. Moreover, we prove the relation (\ref{th}) between
thermal entropy and the entanglement entropy for a generic CFT with discrete

networks are limited by interference due to nearby transmissions.
Millimeter-wave (mmWave) devices offer several potential advantages for ad hoc

building blockages, not to mention huge bandwidth channels for large data
rates.. This paper uses a stochastic geometry approach to characterize the
one-way and two-way signal-to-interference ratio distribution of a mmWave ad
hoc network with directional antennas, random blockages, and ALOHA channel
access. The interference-to-noise ratio shows that a fundamental limitation of
an ad hoc network, interference, may still be an issue. The performance of
mmWave ad hoc networks is bounded by the transmission capacity and area
spectral efficiency. The results show that mmWave networks can support much
higher densities and larger spectral efficiencies, even in the presence of
blockage, compared with lower frequency communication for certain link
distances. Due to the increased bandwidth, the rate coverage of mmWave can be
much greater than lower frequency devices.

resistance. With the goal of better understanding drug resistance and its
connection with the tumor microenvironment, we have developed a hybrid
discrete-continuous mathematical model. In this model, cancer cells described
through a particle-spring approach respond to dynamically changing oxygen and
DNA damaging drug concentrations described through partial differential
equations. We thoroughly explored the behavior of our self-calibrated model
under the following common conditions: a fixed layout of the vasculature, an
identical initial configuration of cancer cells, the same mechanism of drug
action, and one mechanism of cellular response to the drug. We considered one
set of simulations in which drug resistance existed prior to the start of
treatment, and another set in which drug resistance is acquired in response to
treatment. This allows us to compare how both kinds of resistance influence the
spatial and temporal dynamics of the developing tumor, and its clonal
diversity. We show that both pre-existing and acquired resistance can give rise
to three biologically distinct parameter regimes: successful tumor eradication,
reduced effectiveness of drug during the course of treatment (resistance), and

Coulomb interaction is not screened due to the small density of states at the
Fermi energy and thus the long-range Coulomb interaction (LRCI) plays a crucial
role. In this paper, we investigate the surface state with chemical potential
$\mu=0$ in the presence of the LRCI using the Wilsonian renormalization group.
We first check the Fermi velocity enhancement in the surface Dirac system,
which also occurs in a usual Dirac electron system. The most remarkable feature
of the surface Dirac system is that the Dirac Hamiltonian contains not pseudo
spin but real spin Pauli matrices. Because of this feature, we find the
g-factor enhancement, which is a unique property of the surface Dirac system.
We also investigate the explicit form of the spin susceptibility and find that
the spin susceptibility is enhanced in the presence of the LRCI.

Parikh-Wilczek tunneling model of Schwarzschild black hole. We identify the
part of classical correlation and that of quantum entanglement in bipartite
information and point out its imitated relation to quantum gravity correction.
Explicit computation of n-partite information shows that it is positive
(negative) for even (odd) $n$, which happens to agree with the holographic
computation. The fact that entanglement in the mutual information grows with
time mimics the second law of thermodynamics. Later we extend our study to the

  neutrino beams at different baselines","21 pages, 12 figures",,,,"hep-ph hep-ex","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The proposed Long Baseline Neutrino Observatory (LBNO) initially consists of
$\sim 20$ kton liquid double phase TPC complemented by a magnetised iron
calorimeter, to be installed at the Pyh\""asalmi mine, at a distance of 2300 km
from CERN. The conventional neutrino beam is produced by 400 GeV protons
accelerated at the SPS accelerator delivering 700 kW of power. The long
baseline provides a unique opportunity to study neutrino flavour oscillations
over their 1st and 2nd oscillation maxima exploring the $L/E$ behaviour, and
distinguishing effects arising from $\delta_{CP}$ and matter. In this paper we
show how this comprehensive physics case can be further enhanced and
complemented if a neutrino beam produced at the Protvino IHEP accelerator
complex, at a distance of 1160 km, and with modest power of 450 kW is aimed
towards the same far detectors. We show that the coupling of two independent
sub-MW conventional neutrino and antineutrino beams at different baselines from
CERN and Protvino will allow to measure CP violation in the leptonic sector at
a confidence level of at least $3\sigma$ for 50\% of the true values of
$\delta_{CP}$ with a 20 kton detector. With a far detector of 70 kton, the
combination allows a $3\sigma$ sensitivity for 75\% of the true values of
$\delta_{CP}$ after 10 years of running. Running two independent neutrino
beams, each at a power below 1 MW, is more within today's state of the art than
the long-term operation of a new single high-energy multi-MW facility, which
has several technical challenges and will likely require a learning curve.

Minor changes to match published version","JHEP 1506 (2015) 041","10.1007/JHEP06(2015)041",,"hep-ph hep-th","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In supersymmetric (SUSY) theories with extra dimensions the visible energy in
sparticle decays can be significantly reduced and its energy distribution
broadened, thus significantly weakening the present collider limits on SUSY.
The mechanism applies when the lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP) is a bulk
state-- e.g. a bulk modulino, axino, or gravitino-- the size of the extra
dimensions larger than ~$10^{-14}$ cm, and for a broad variety of visible
sparticle spectra. In such cases the lightest ordinary supersymmetric particle
(LOSP), necessarily a brane-localised state, decays to the Kaluza-Klein (KK)
discretuum of the LSP. This dynamically realises the compression mechanism for
hiding SUSY as decays into the more numerous heavier KK LSP states are favored.
We find LHC limits on right-handed slepton LOSPs evaporate, while LHC limits on
stop LOSPs weaken to ~350-410 GeV compared to ~700 GeV for a stop decaying to a
massless LSP. Similarly, for the searches we consider, present limits on direct
production of degenerate first and second generation squarks drop to ~450 GeV
compared to ~800 GeV for a squark decaying to a massless LSP. Auto-concealment
typically works for a fundamental gravitational scale of $M_*$~10-100 TeV, a
scale sufficiently high that traditional searches for signatures of extra
dimensions are mostly avoided. If superpartners are discovered, their prompt,
displaced, or stopped decays can also provide new search opportunities for
extra dimensions with the potential to reach $M_*$~$10^9$ GeV. This mechanism
applies more generally than just SUSY theories, pertaining to any theory where
there is a discrete quantum number shared by both brane and bulk sectors.

in quantum optics experiments has created a demand for fast, high resolution
and accurate source characterization. A promising tool for such
characterization uses the classical stimulated process, in which an additional
seed laser stimulates photon generation yielding much higher count rates, as
recently demonstrated for a $\chi^{(2)}$ integrated source in A.~Eckstein
\emph{et al.}, Laser Photon. Rev. \textbf{8}, L76 (2014). In this work we
extend these results to $\chi^{(3)}$ sources, demonstrating spectral
correlation measurements via stimulated four-wave mixing for the first time in
a integrated optical waveguide, namely a silicon nanowire. We directly confirm
the speed-up due to higher count rates and demonstrate that additional
resolution can be gained when compared to traditional coincidence measurements.
As pump pulse duration can influence the degree of spectral entanglement, all
of our measurements are taken for two different pump pulse widths. This allows
us to confirm that the classical stimulated process correctly captures the
degree of spectral entanglement regardless of pump pulse duration, and cements
its place as an essential characterization method for the development of future
quantum integrated devices.

distributed approximately equally between two types of the readout. Light
collection non-uniformity across and along the strip is about $\pm13\%$ from
maximum to minimum. The resulting energy resolution is modest, $\sigma/E=15\%$
at 5MeV. This leads to a smearing of the oscillation pattern comparable with
the smearing due to the large size of the reactor core. Nevertheless because of
the large counting rate ($\sim 10000$ / day), small background ($<1\%$) and
good control of systematic uncertainties due to frequent changes of positions,
the DANSS is quite sensitive to reactor antineutrino oscillations to
hypothetical sterile neutrinos with a mass in eV ballpark suggested recently to
explain a so-called ""reactor anomaly"". DANSS will have an elaborated
calibration system. The high granularity of the detector allows calibration of
every strip with about 40 thousand cosmic muons every day. The expected
systematic effects do not reduce much the sensitivity region. Tests of the
detector prototype DANSSino demonstrated that in spite of a small size ($4\%$
of DANSS), it is quite sensitive to reactor antineutrinos, detecting about 70
Inverse Beta Decay events per day with the signal-to-background ratio of about
unity. The prototype tests have demonstrated feasibility to reach the design
performance of the DANSS detector.

estimated to account for ~5-30% of the total SN Ia rate, and most SNe Iax have
been discovered in late-type galaxies. In addition, observations constrain the
progenitor systems of some SN Iax progenitors have ages of <80Myr. Recently,
the weak deflagration explosions of Ch-mass CO WDs seem to provide a viable
physical scenario for SNe Iax. Here, comparing theoretical predictions from BPS
calculations with SN Iax observations, we put constraints on the SD Ch-mass
model as a possible Iax progenitor. A long delay times of >3Gyr and low SN
rates of ~3e-5/yr are found in our RG donor channel, indicating that this
channel is unlikely to produce SNe Iax. We predict that the Galactic rate from
the MS (He) donor channel is ~1.5e-3/yr (3e-4/yr), which is consistent with the
observed Iax rate. The short delay times in the He channel support the young
host environments of SNe Iax. However, the relative long delay times in the MS
donor channel are less favourable for the observational constraints on the Iax
progenitor ages. Finally, we set an upper limit on the pre-SN mass-loss rate at
< 10e-4 M_sun/yr (for V_wind=100 km/s). The delay times in the SD Ch-mass model
do not account for that most SNe Iax are located in late-type galaxies.
However, at least one Iax event (SN 2008ge) is hosted by a S0 galaxy with no
signs of star formation. Moreover, current X-ray observations cannot rule out
the SD Ch-mass model. Taking all these into account and considering the
uncertainty of the observed rate for SNe Iax, we suggest that some SNe Iax may
be produced from weak deflagrations of Ch-mass CO WDs in SD progenitors,
especially in the He-star channel. This is consistent with recent analysis of
HST observations for the SN Iax SN2012Z. However, this SD deflagration model is
still unlikely to be the most common progenitor scenario for SNe Iax.

their ability to greatly increase the scale at which existing algorithms may
operate. Most of these methods are designed to generate binary codes preserving
the Euclidean similarity in the original space. Manifold learning techniques,
in contrast, are better able to model the intrinsic structure embedded in the
original high-dimensional data. The complexities of these models, and the
problems with out-of-sample data, have previously rendered them unsuitable for
application to large-scale embedding, however. In this work, how to learn
compact binary embeddings on their intrinsic manifolds is considered. In order
to address the above-mentioned difficulties, an efficient, inductive solution
to the out-of-sample data problem, and a process by which non-parametric
manifold learning may be used as the basis of a hashing method is proposed. The
proposed approach thus allows the development of a range of new hashing
techniques exploiting the flexibility of the wide variety of manifold learning
approaches available. It is particularly shown that hashing on the basis of
t-SNE outperforms state-of-the-art hashing methods on large-scale benchmark
datasets, and is very effective for image classification with very short code
lengths. The proposed hashing framework is shown to be easily improved, for
example, by minimizing the quantization error with learned orthogonal
rotations. In addition, a supervised inductive manifold hashing framework is
developed by incorporating the label information, which is shown to greatly
advance the semantic retrieval performance.

has a couple of advantages over the previous designs (e.g. more uniqueness

to the equilibrium that satisfies a particular criterion. This criterion can be
chosen by the designer to achieve a certain optimality among the equilibria.
Furthermore, we propose the inexact method that helps us to boost the

decay of 55Fe is a promising diagnostic to distinguish between Type Ia
supernova (SN Ia) explosion models. Using radiation transport calculations, we
compute the line flux for two 3D explosion models: a near-Chandrasekhar mass
delayed detonation and a violent merger of two white dwarfs. Both models are
based on solar metallicity zero-age main sequence progenitors. Due to explosive
nuclear burning at higher density, the delayed-detonation model synthesises 3.5
times more radioactive 55Fe than the merger model. As a result, we find that
the peak Mn Kalpha line flux of the delayed-detonation model exceeds that of
the merger model by a factor of 4.5. Since in both models the 5.9 keV X-ray
flux peaks five to six years after the explosion, a single measurement of the
X-ray line emission at this time can place a constraint on the explosion
physics that is complementary to those derived from earlier phase optical
spectra or light curves. We perform detector simulations of current and future
X-ray telescopes to investigate the possibilities of detecting the X-ray line
at 5.9 keV. For the delayed-detonation scenario, a line detection is feasible
with Chandra up to 3 Mpc for an exposure time of 10^6 s. We find that it should
be possible with currently existing X-ray instruments (with exposure times
5x10^5 s) to detect both of our models at sufficiently high S/N to distinguish
between them for hypothetical events within the Local Group. The prospects for
detection will be better with future missions. For example, the proposed
Athena/X-IFU instrument could detect our delayed-detonation model out to a
distance of 5 Mpc. This would make it possible to study future events occurring
during its operational life at distances comparable to those of the recent
supernovae SN 2011fe (6.4 Mpc) and SN 2014J (3.5 Mpc).

  with censored data",,,,,"stat.ME stat.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  How to include censored data in a statistical analysis is a recur-rent issue
in statistics. In multivariate extremes, the dependence structure of large
observations can be characterized in terms of a non parametric angular measure,
while marginal excesses above asymptotically large thresholds have a parametric
distribution. In this work, a flexible semi-parametric Dirichlet mix-ture model
for angular measures is adapted to the context of censored data and missing
components. One major issue is to take into account censoring intervals
overlapping the extremal threshold, without knowing whether the correspond-ing
hidden data is actually extreme. Further, the censored likelihood needed for
Bayesian inference has no analytic expression. The first issue is tackled using
a Poisson process model for extremes, whereas a data augmentation scheme avoids
multivariate integration of the Poisson process intensity over both the
censored intervals and the failure region above threshold. The implemented MCMC
algorithm allows simultaneous estimation of marginal and dependence parameters,
so that all sources of uncertainty other than model bias are cap-tured by
posterior credible intervals. The method is illustrated on simulated and real
data.

and robust price of anarchy is that, for any sum-bounded utilitarian social
function, the worst-case price of anarchy of coarse correlated equilibria
coincides with that of pure Nash equilibria in the class of weighted congestion
games with non-negative and non-decreasing latency functions and that such a
value can always be derived through the, so called, smoothness argument. We
significantly extend this result by proving that, for a variety of (even
non-sum-bounded) utilitarian and egalitarian social functions and for a broad
generalization of the class of weighted congestion games with non-negative (and
possibly decreasing) latency functions, the worst-case price of anarchy of
$\epsilon$-approximate coarse correlated equilibria still coincides with that
of $\epsilon$-approximate pure Nash equilibria, for any $\epsilon\geq 0$. As a
byproduct of our proof, it also follows that such a value can always be
determined by making use of the primal-dual method we introduced in a previous
work. It is important to note that our scenario of investigation is beyond the
scope of application of the robust price of anarchy (for as it is currently
defined), so that our result seems unlikely to be alternatively proved via the
smoothness framework.

growth of large-area single crystal of the C8-BTBT monolayer. Our experimental
result indicates that only out-of-plane roughness greater than 0.6 nm of the

benchmarks for current models of galaxy evolution. A natural extension of these
benchmarks is the two-dimensional distribution of galaxies in the plane spanned
by stellar and HI mass, which provides a more stringent test of simulations, as
it requires the HI to be located in galaxies of the correct stellar mass.
Combining HI data from the ALFALFA survey, with optical data from SDSS, we find
a distinct envelope in the HI-to-stellar mass distribution, corresponding to an
upper limit in the HI fraction that varies monotonically over five orders of
magnitude in stellar mass. This upper envelope in HI fraction does not favour
the existence of a significant population of dark galaxies with large amounts
of gas but no corresponding stellar population. The envelope shows a break at a
stellar mass of ~10^9 Msun, which is not reproduced by modern models of galaxy
populations tracing both stellar and gas masses. The discrepancy between
observations and models suggests a mass dependence in gas storage and
consumption missing in current galaxy evolution prescriptions. The break
coincides with the transition from galaxies with predominantly irregular
morphology at low masses to regular disks at high masses, as well as the
transition from cold to hot accretion of gas in simulations.

ribbons crystallize into a cubic structure and exhibit very fine crystallite
size of < 2 nm. Temperature dependent magnetization (M-T) measurements reveal
that austenite (A)-martensite (M) phase transition begins at T~248 K and
finishes at T~238 K during cooling cycle and these values increase to T~267 K
and T~259 K while warming. In cooling cycle, the A-phase shows ferromagnetic
(FM) ordering with a Curie temperature T~267 K, while both the
FM-antiferromagnetic (AFM) and M-transitions occur at T~242 K. The M-phase
undergoes FM transition at T~145 K. These transitions are also confirmed by
temperature dependent resistivity measurements. The observed hysteretic
behaviour of magnetization and resistivity in the temperature regime spanned by
the A-M transition is a manifestation of the first order phase transition.
Magnetization and susceptibility data also provide unambiguous evidence in
favour of spin glass . The scaling of the glass freezing temperature (Tf) with
frequency, extracted from the frequency dependent AC susceptibility
measurements, confirms the existence of canonical spin glass at T<145 K. The
occurrence of canonical spin glass has been explained in terms of the
nanostructuring modified interactions between the FM correlations in the
martensitic phase and the coexisting AFM.

field cooled warming (FCW) magnetization measurements suggest towards the
non-ergodic magnetic state. The origin of this nonergodicity could be traced to
the magnetic liquid like state arising from the delicacy of the coexisting
magnetic phases, viz., ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic-charge ordered
(FM/AFM-CO). The large difference between the insulator metal transitions
during cooling and warming cycles (TIMC~64 K and TIMW~123 K) could be regarded
as a manifestation of the nonergodicity leading to supercooling of the magnetic
liquid while cooling. The nonergodicity and supercooling are weakened by the
AFM-FM phase transition induced by an external magnetic field. TIM and small
polaron activation energy corresponding the magnetic liquid state (cooling
cycle) vary nonlinearly with the applied magnetic field but become linear in
the crystalline solid state (warming cycle). The analysis of the low
temperature resistivity data shows that electron-phonon interaction is
drastically reduced by the applied magnetic field. The resistivity minimum in
the lower temperature region of the self-field warming curve has been explained
in terms of the Kondo like scattering in the magnetically inhomogeneous regime.

Based on the symmetry and field-dependence of the transverse resistance, we
develop a consistent method to separate thermoelectric and SOT measurements. By
addressing first ferromagnet/light metal bilayers with negligible spin-orbit
coupling, we show that in-plane current injection induces a vertical thermal
gradient whose sign and magnitude are determined by the resistivity difference
and stacking order of the magnetic and nonmagnetic layers. We then study
ferromagnet/heavy metal bilayers with strong spin-orbit coupling, showing that
second harmonic thermoelectric contributions to the transverse voltage may lead
to a significant overestimation of the antidamping SOT. We find that
thermoelectric effects are very strong in Ta(6nm)/Co(2.5nm) and negligible in
Pt(6nm)/Co(2.5nm) bilayers. After including these effects in the analysis of
the transverse voltage, we find that the antidamping SOTs in these bilayers,
after normalization to the magnetization volume, are comparable to those found
in thinner Co layers with perpendicular magnetization, whereas the field-like
SOTs are about an order of magnitude smaller.

Relative to the former, high-precision observational data have confirmed with

problems in cosmology, represents a new imbalance in the governing
gravitational equations. Several candidates, responsible for this expansion,

contact stiffness, which are conventionally trivialized is the focus of this
study. Series of Discrete Element Method simulations are performed on a weakly
frictional granular assembly in a split-bottom geometry considering various
gravity fields and contact stiffnesses. While traditionally the inertial
number, i.e., the ratio of stress to strain-rate timescales describes the flow
rheology, we find that a second dimensionless number, the ratio of softness and
stress timescales, must also be included to characterize the bulk flow
behavior. For slow, quasi-static flows, the density increases while the
macroscopic friction decreases with respective increase in particle softness
and gravity. This trend is added to the $\mu(I)$ rheology and can be traced
back to the anisotropy in the contact network, displaying a linear correlation
between macroscopic friction and deviatoric fabric in the steady state.
Interestingly, the linear relation holds when the external rotation rate is
increased for a given gravity field and contact stiffness.

the inner cavity wall. Introducing helium gas in the cavity and measuring its
pressure as a function of applied field allowed to conclude that the inner
surface of the cavity is heated up by only 60+/-60 mK when Rs increases with

  Methods: We analysed intracranial electroencephalographic recordings of 86

correlation analyses, we derived a sequence of weighted epileptic networks
spanning the pre-ictal, ictal, and post-ictal period, and each recording site
represents a network node. We assessed node importance with commonly used
centrality indices that take into account different network properties.
  Results: A high variability of temporal evolution of node importance was
observed, both intra- and interindividually. Nevertheless, nodes near and far
off the seizure onset zone (SOZ) were rated as most important for seizure
dynamics more often (65% of cases) than nodes from within the SOZ (35% of

  Conclusion: Our findings underline the high relevance of brain outside of the

fundamental ingredient for modeling the propagation process of GCRs based on
the so-called weighted slab method. We try to derive this distribution
numerically by taking into account the discreteness in both space and time of
occurrences of supernova explosions where GCRs are suspected to be born. We
solve numerically the stochastic differential equations equivalent to the
Parker diffusion-convection equation which describes the propagation process of
GCR in the Galaxy. We assume the three-dimensional diffusion is an isotropic
one without any free escape boundaries. We ignore any energy change of GCRs and
the existence of the Galactic wind for simplicity. We also assume axisymmetric
configurations for the density distributions of the interstellar matter and for
the surface density of supernovae. We have calculated age and path length of
GCR protons arriving at the solar system with this stochastic method. The
obtained age is not the escape time of GCRs from the Galaxy as usually assumed,
but the time spent by GCRs during their journey to the solar system from the
supernova remnants where they were born. The derived age and path length show a
distribution spread in a wide range even for GCR protons arriving at the solar
system with the same energy. The distributions show a cut-off at a lower range
in age or path length depending on the energy of GCRs. These cut-offs clearly
come from the discreteness of occurrence of supernovae. The mean age of GeV
particles obtained from the distributions is consistent with the age obtained
by direct observation of radioactive secondary nuclei. The energy dependence of
the B/C ratio estimated with the path length distribution reproduces reliably
the energy dependence of B/C obtained by recent observations in space.

amyloid-related diseases. Yet it has remained unsolved whether the oligomers
are a necessary step in the formation of amyloid fibrils, or just a dangerous
by-product. Analogously, it has not been resolved if the amyloid nucleation
process is a classical one-step nucleation process, or a two-step process
involving pre-nucleation clusters. We use coarse-grained computer simulations
to study the effect of non-specific attractions between peptides on the primary
nucleation process underlying amyloid fibrillization. We find that for peptides
that do not attract, the classical one-step nucleation mechanism is possible,
but only at non-physiologically high peptide concentrations. At low peptide
concentrations, which mimic the physiologically relevant regime, attractive
inter-peptide interactions are essential for fibril formation. Nucleation then
inevitably takes place through a two-step mechanism involving prefibrillar
oligomers. We show that oligomers not only help peptides meet each other, but
create an environment that facilitates the conversion of monomers into the
$\beta$-sheet rich form characteristic of fibrils. Nucleation typically does
not proceed via the most prevalent oligomers, but via an oligomer size that is
only observed in rare fluctuations, which is why such aggregates might be hard
to capture experimentally. Finally, we find that the nucleation of amyloid
fibrils cannot be described by classical nucleation theory: in the two-step
mechanism the critical nucleus size increases both with an increase in
concentration and in the inter-peptide interactions, in direct contrast with
predictions from classical nucleation theory.

employs numerical integration only for the fault-on period to determine the

maximum length of a time window for a SAS to keep its accuracy, and
accordingly, introduces a divergence indicator for adaptive time windows. The

for photometric monitoring of selected eccentric eclipsing binaries located in
the Small Magellanic Cloud. The new times of minima were derived for these
systems, which are needed for accurate determination of the apsidal motion.
Moreover, many new times of minima were derived from the photometric databases
OGLE and MACHO. Eighteen early-type eccentric-orbit eclipsing binaries were
studied.
  Methods: Their (O-C) diagrams of minima timings were analysed and the
parameters of the apsidal motion were obtained. The light curves of these
eighteen binaries were analysed using the program PHOEBE, giving the light
curve parameters. For several systems the additional third light also was
detected.
  Results: We derived for the first time and significantly improved the
relatively short periods of apsidal motion from 19 to 142 years for these
systems. The relativistic effects are weak, up to 10% of the total apsidal
motion rate. For one system (OGLE-SMC-ECL-0888), the third-body hypothesis was
also presented, which agrees with high value of the third light for this system
detected during the light curve solution.

the previously reported energetic preference of the fcc faulty stacking of Mg
monomers on Mg(0001). We first provide a viewpoint on how Friedel oscillations
influence ionic relaxation on these surfaces. Our three-dimensional
charge-density analysis demonstrates that Friedel oscillations have maxima
which are more spatially localized than what one-dimensional average density or
two-dimensional cross sectional plots could possibly inform: The well-known
charge-density enhancement around the topmost surface layer of Mg(0001) is
strongly localized at its fcc hollow sites. The charge accumulation at this
site explains the energetically preferred stacking fault of the Mg monomer,
dimer and trimer. Yet, larger islands prefer the normal hcp stacking.
Surprisingly, the mechanism by which the fcc site becomes energetically more
favorable is not that of enhancing the surface-adatom bonds but rather those
between surface atoms. To confirm our conclusions, we analyze the stacking of
Be adatom on Be(0001) - a surface also largely influenced by Friedel
oscillations. We find, in fact, a much stronger effect: The charge enhancement
at the fcc site is even larger and, consequently, the stacking-fault energy
favoring the fcc site is quite large, 44 meV.

Each user wants to exchange messages with all the other users via the relay. A
transmission strategy is proposed based on channel diagonalization that
decomposes the channel into parallel sub-channels, and physical-layer network
coding over these sub-channels. It is shown that the proposed strategy achieves
the optimal DoF region of the channel if $N\leq M$. Furthermore, the proposed
strategy that requires joint encoding over multiple sub-channels is compared to
another strategy that encodes over each sub-channel separately. It turns out
that coding jointly over sub-channels is necessary for an optimal transmission
strategy. This shows that the MIMO Y-channel is inseparable.

involved in the process, and that the imaginary part is related to the

(WS2). We show that in such devices graphene acquires a SOC as high as 17meV,
three orders of magnitude higher than its intrinsic value, without modifying
any of the structural properties of the graphene. Such proximity SOC leads to
the spin Hall effect even at room temperature and opens the doors for spin
FETs. We show that intrinsic defects in WS2 play an important role in this
proximity effect and that graphene can act as a probe to detect defects in
semiconducting surfaces.

crystal and electronic structure calculations by using PBE and optB86b-vdW
functionals and investigated the effects of long range Van der Waals
interactions for different coverages starting from a single isolated molecule
up to 4 monolayers of coverage. For an isolated molecule both functionals yield
the hollow site as the most stable one with bridge-60 site being very close in
energy in case of optB86b-vdW. Binding strength of an isolated pentacene on the
step edge was found to be much larger than that on the terrace sites. Different
experimentally reported monolayer structures were compared and the (6 x 3) unit
cell was found to be energetically more stable than the (2 x 2 $\sqrt{7}$) and
(2 x $\sqrt{31}$) ones. For one monolayer films while dispersion corrected
calculations favored flat pentacene molecules on terraces, standard (PBE)
calculations either found tilted and flat configurations to be energetically
similar (on (111) surface) or favored the tilted configuration (on (455)
surface). PDOS calculations performed with optB86b-vdW functional showed larger
dispersion of molecular orbitals over the Au states for the (455) surface when
compared with the (111) surface, indicating an enhanced charge carrier
transport at the pentacene-gold interface in favor of the vicinal surface.
Starting with the second monolayer, both functionals favored tilted
configurations for both surfaces. Our results underline the importance of the
dispersion corrections for the loosely bound systems like pentacene on gold and
the role played by step edges in determining the multilayer film structure and
charge transfer at the organic molecule-metal interface.

the radio-loudness of the AGN. Furthermore, despite the low statistical

various tracers of nuclear activity (mainly [O III] emission line nuclear

step scaling analysis of the Twisted Eguchi-Kawai (TEK) model, the SU($N$)
gauge theory on a single site lattice with twisted boundary conditions. The
computation relies on the conjecture that finite volume effects for SU(N) gauge
theories defined on a 4-dimensional twisted torus are controlled by an
effective size parameter $\tilde l = l \sqrt{N}$, with $l$ the torus period. We
set the scale for the running coupling in terms of $\tilde l$ and use the
gradient flow to define a renormalized 't Hooft coupling $\lambda(\tilde l)$.
In the TEK model, this idea allows the determination of the running of the
coupling through a step scaling procedure that uses the rank of the group as a
size parameter. The continuum renormalized coupling constant is extracted in
the zero lattice spacing limit, which in the TEK model corresponds to the large
$N$ limit taken at fixed value of $\lambda(\tilde l)$. The coupling constant is
thus expected to coincide with that of the ordinary pure gauge theory at $N
=\infty$. The idea is shown to work and permits us to follow the evolution of
the coupling over a wide range of scales. At weak coupling we find a remarkable
agreement with the perturbative two-loop formula for the running coupling.

spin transport in structures where the dimensions are smaller than the spin
relaxation length. However, the study of spin injection and transport in
graphene nanostructures is highly unexplored. Here we study the spin injection
and relaxation in nanostructured graphene with dimensions smaller than the spin
relaxation length. For graphene nanoislands, where the edge length to area
ratio is much higher than for standard devices, we show that enhanced spin-flip
processes at the edges do not seem to play a major role in the spin relaxation.
On the other hand, contact induced spin relaxation has a much more dramatic
effect for these low dimensional structures. By studying the nonlocal spin
transport through a graphene quantum dot we observe that the obtained values
for spin relaxation are dominated by the connecting graphene islands and not by
the quantum dot itself. Using a simple model we argue that future nonlocal
Hanle precession measurements can obtain a more significant value for the spin
relaxation time for the quantum dot by using high spin polarization contacts in
combination with low tunneling rates.

unprecedented length, duty cycle and precision. To fully analyse these data for
the tens of thousands of stars observed by Kepler, automated methods are a
prerequisite. Here we present an automated procedure to determine the period
spacing of gravity modes in red-giant stars ascending the red-giant branch. The
gravity modes reside in a cavity in the deep interior of the stars and provide
information on the conditions in the stellar core. However, for red giants the
gravity modes are not directly observable on the surface, hence this method is
based on the pressure-gravity mixed modes that present observable features in
the Fourier power spectrum. The method presented here is based on the vertical
alignment and symmetry of these mixed modes in a period echelle diagram. We
find that we can obtain reliable results for both model frequencies and
observed frequencies. Additionally, we carried out Monte Carlo tests to obtain
realistic uncertainties on the period spacings with different set of
oscillation modes (for the models) and uncertainties on the frequencies.
Furthermore, this method has been used to improve mode detection and
identification of the observed frequencies in an iterative manner.

means that somehow our brain implements the function that a universal Turing
machine implements. The point is that evolution achieved Turing completeness,
and then the explanation should be evolutionary, but our explanation is
mathematical. The trick is to introduce a mathematical theory of problems,
under the basic assumption that solving more problems provides more survival
opportunities. So we build a problem theory by fusing set and computing
theories. Then we construct a series of resolvers, where each resolver is
defined by its computing capacity, that exhibits the following property: all
problems solved by a resolver are also solved by the next resolver in the
series if certain condition is satisfied. The last of the conditions is to be
Turing complete. This series defines a resolvers hierarchy that could be seen
as a framework for the evolution of cognition. Then the answer to our question
would be: to solve most problems. By the way, the problem theory defines
adaptation, perception, and learning, and it shows that there are just three
ways to resolve any problem: routine, trial, and analogy. And, most
importantly, this theory demonstrates how problems can be used to found

have a long-standing tradition and the underlying fundamental concepts have
subsequently been successfully extended to optical frequencies and even to
implement quantum gate operations. Transferring these paradigms to
nanomechanical systems requires tailored nanomechanical waveforms. Here, we
report on an additive Fourier synthesizer for nanomechanical waveforms based on

synthesize four different elementary nanomechanical waveforms from a
fundamental surface acoustic wave at $ f_1 \sim 150$ MHz using a superposition
of up to three discrete harmonics $f_n$. We employ these shaped pulses to
interact with an individual sensor quantum dot and detect their deliberately
and temporally modulated strain component via the opto-mechanical quantum dot
response. Importantly, and in contrast to the direct mechanical actuation by
bulk piezoactuators, surface acoustic waves provide much higher frequencies (>
20 GHz) to resonantly drive mechanical motion. Thus, our technique uniquely
allows coherent mechanical control of localized vibronic modes of

perturbations. More generally, we show that many of the cosmological
observables, normally attributed to the dynamics of expanding space, could be
of kinematic origin. In gravitationally bound systems, the values of G and
particle masses spontaneously freeze out by a symmetry breaking of the
underlying conformal symmetry, and the theory reduces to standard general
relativity (with, e.g., all solar system tests satisfied).

extremely successful in describing physics covering a huge range of scales.
However, its interpretation remains controversial since the early days of
quantum mechanics. What does a quantum state really mean? Is there any way out
of the so-called quantum measurement problem? Here we present an
information-complete quantum theory (ICQT) and the trinary property of nature
to beat the above problems. We assume that a quantum system's state provides an
information-complete description of the system in the trinary picture. We give
a consistent formalism of quantum theory that makes the
information-completeness explicitly and argue that conventional quantum
mechanics is an approximation of the ICQT. We then show how our ICQT provides a
coherent picture and fresh angle of some existing problems in physics. The
computational content of our theory is uncovered by defining an
information-complete quantum computer.

structure in a soft magnetic film that is sandwiched between and

hard magnetic moments, a helix with a turn of 180$^{\circ}$ is stable without
the presence of an external magnetic field. The magnetic stability is
determined by the energy minimization and is a result of an internal field
created by exchange interaction and anisotropy. Since the internal field stores
magnetic energy, the helix can serve as an energy-storing element in spin-based
nanodevices. Due to the significantly different magnetic resonance frequencies,
the ferromagnetic and helical ground states are easy to distinguish in a
broadband ferromagnetic resonance experiment.

consistent univariate autoregressive (AR) models of low order for filtering and
predicting nonlinear turbulent signals with memory depth. By stable, we refer
to the classical stability condition for the AR model. By consistent, we refer
to the classical consistency constraints of Adams-Bashforth methods of
order-two. One attractive feature of this algebraic method is that the model
parameters can be obtained without directly knowing any training data set as
opposed to many standard, regression-based parameterization methods. It takes
only long-time average statistics as inputs. The proposed method provides a
discretization time step interval which guarantees the existence of stable and
consistent AR model and simultaneously produces the parameters for the AR
models. In our numerical examples with two chaotic time series with different
characteristics of decaying time scales, we find that the proposed AR models
produce significantly more accurate short-term predictive skill and comparable
filtering skill relative to the linear regression-based AR models. These
encouraging results are robust across wide ranges of discretization times,
observation times, and observation noise variances. Finally, we also find that
the proposed model produces an improved short-time prediction relative to the
linear regression-based AR-models in forecasting a data set that characterizes
the variability of the Madden-Julian Oscillation, a dominant tropical
atmospheric wave pattern.

fire fighter can build a barrier at speed $v>1$. How large must $v$ be to
ensure that the fire can be contained, and how should the fire fighter proceed?
We contribute two results.
  First, we analyze the natural curve $\mbox{FF}_v$ that develops when the
fighter keeps building, at speed $v$, a barrier along the boundary of the
expanding fire. We prove that the behavior of this spiralling curve is governed
by a complex function $(e^{w Z} - s \, Z)^{-1}$, where $w$ and $s$ are real
functions of $v$. For $v>v_c=2.6144 \ldots$ all zeroes are complex conjugate
pairs. If $\phi$ denotes the complex argument of the conjugate pair nearest to
the origin then, by residue calculus, the fire fighter needs $\Theta( 1/\phi)$
rounds before the fire is contained. As $v$ decreases towards $v_c$ these two
zeroes merge into a real one, so that argument $\phi$ goes to~0. Thus, curve
$\mbox{FF}_v$ does not contain the fire if the fighter moves at speed $v=v_c$.
(That speed $v>v_c$ is sufficient for containing the fire has been proposed
before by Bressan et al. [7], who constructed a sequence of logarithmic spiral
segments that stay strictly away from the fire.)
  Second, we show that any curve that visits the four coordinate half-axes in
cyclic order, and in inreasing distances from the origin, needs speed
$v>1.618\ldots$, the golden ratio, in order to contain the fire.

characterised by the folk theorem do exist. By adopting specific reactive
strategies, a group of players can be better off by coordinating their actions
in repeated games. We call it a type-k equilibrium when a group of k players
coordinate their actions and they have no incentive to deviate from their
strategies simultaneously. The existence and stability of the type-k
equilibrium in general games is discussed. This study shows that the sets of
Nash equilibria and evolutionarily stable states have greater cardinality than

was developed. For this purpose the tetrakaidecahedron geometry was used and
different shapes of strut cross-sections of foam structures were taken
explicitly into account. The derived correlation to predict geometrical
properties can be easily extended to different strut shapes. 3-D numerical
simulations at pore scale were performed to study the pressure drop
characteristics and effective thermal conductivity. Fluid flow through open
cell foam was performed in three different regimes: Darcy regime, transition
regime and inertia regime. Importance of geometrical properties on fluid flow
characteristics and their inclusion in the proposed correlations for predicting
pressure drop is discussed. Can Ergun parameters have constant numerical values

to predict the effective thermal conductivity for both, isotropic and
anisotropic open cell foams. Geometrical parameters of foam matrix were
introduced in the correlations to predict effective thermal conductivity.

LOx/hydrocarbon combustion for propulsion systems. The present research effort
is driven by the continued interest in achieving low cost, reliable access to
space and more recently, by the renewed interest in hypersonic transportation
systems capable of reducing time-to-destination. Moreover, combustion at high
pressure has been assumed as a key issue to achieve better propulsive
performance and lower environmental impact, as long as the replacement of
hydrogen with a hydrocarbon, to reduce the costs related to ground operations
and increase flexibility. The current work provides a model for the numerical
simulation of high- pressure turbulent combustion employing detailed chemistry
description, embedded in a RANS equations solver with a Low Reynolds number
k-omega turbulence model. The model used to study such a combustion phenomenon
is an extension of the standard flamelet-progress-variable (FPV) turbulent
combustion model combined with a Reynolds Averaged Navier-Stokes equation
Solver (RANS). In the FPV model, all of the thermo-chemical quantities are
evaluated by evolving the mixture fraction Z and a progress variable C. When
using a turbulence model in conjunction with FPV model, a probability density
function (PDF) is required to evaluate statistical averages of chemical
quantities. The choice of such PDF must be a compromise between computational
costs and accuracy level. State- of-the-art FPV models are built presuming the
functional shape of the joint PDF of Z and C in order to evaluate
Favre-averages of thermodynamic quantities. The model here proposed evaluates
the most probable joint distribution of Z and C without any assumption on their
behavior.
