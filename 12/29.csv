constant non-equilibrium constraints when the latter are enforced by reservoirs
exchanging conserved microscopic quantities. At a mesoscopic scale only the
energies of the macroscopic bodies are accessible together with the
configurations of the contact system. We consider a class of models where the
contact system, as well as macroscopic bodies, have a finite number of possible
configurations. The global system with only discrete degrees of freedom has no
microscopic Hamiltonian dynamics, but it is shown that, if the microscopic
dynamics is assumed to be deterministic and ergodic and to conserve energy
according to some specific pattern, and if the mesoscopic evolution of the
global system is approximated by a Markov process as closely as possible, then
the mesoscopic transition rates obey three constraints. In the limit where
macroscopic bodies can be considered as reservoirs at thermodynamic equilibrium
(but with different intensive parameters) the mesoscopic transition rates turn
into transition rates for the contact system and the third constraint becomes
local detailed balance ; the latter is generically expressed in terms of the
microscopic exchange entropy variation, namely the opposite of the variation of
the thermodynamic entropy of the reservoir involved in a given microscopic jump
of the contact system configuration. For a finite-time evolution after contact
has been switched on we derive a fluctuation relation for the joint probability
of the heat amounts received from the various reservoirs. The generalization to
systems exchanging energy, volume and matter with several reservoirs, with a
possible conservative external force acting on the contact system, is given
explicitly.

the full sun at frequencies between 150 and 450 MHz, with typical resolution 3
arcmin and time cadence 0.2 s. Combining visibilities from the NRH and from the
Giant Meterwave Radio Telescope (GMRT) allows us to produce images of the sun
at 236 or 327 MHz, with a large FOV, high resolution and time cadence. We seek
to investigate the structure of noise storms (the most common non-thermal solar
radio emission). We focus on the relation of position and altitude of noise
storms with the observing frequency and on the lower limit of their sizes. We
present results for noise storms on four days. The results consist of an
extended halo and of one or several compact cores with relative intensity
changing over a few seconds. We found that core sizes can be almost stable over
one hour, with a minimum in the range 31-35 arcsec (less than previously
reported) and can be stable over one hour. The heliocentric distances of noise
storms are $\sim 1.20$ and 1.35 $R_{\odot}$ at 432 and 150 MHz, respectively.
Regions where storms originate are thus much denser than the ambient corona and
their vertical extent is found to be less than expected from hydrostatic
equilibrium. The smallest observed sizes impose upper limits on broadening
effects due to scattering on density inhomogeneities in the low and medium
corona and constrain the level of density turbulence in the solar corona. It is
possible that scatter broadening has been overestimated in the past, and that
the observed sizes cannot only be attributed to scattering. The vertical
structure of the noise storms is difficult to reconcile with the classical
columnar model.

which $F(R)$ gravities can produce the matter bounce cosmological solutions.
Owing to the specific functional form of the matter bounce Hubble parameter,
the reconstruction technique leads, after some simplifications, to the same
Hubble parameter as in the matter bounce scenario. Focusing the study to the
large and small cosmic time $t$ limits, we were able to find which $F(R)$
gravities can generate the matter bounce Hubble parameter. In the case of small
cosmic time limit, which corresponds to large curvature values, the $F(R)$
gravity is $F(R)\sim R+\alpha R^2$, which is an inflation generating gravity,
and at small curvature, or equivalently, large cosmic time, the $F(R)$ gravity
generating the corresponding limit of the matter bounce Hubble parameter, is
$F(R)\sim \frac{1}{R}$, a gravity known to produce late-time acceleration. Thus
we have the physically appealing picture in which a Jordan frame $F(R)$ gravity
that imitates the matter bounce solution at large and small curvatures, can
generate Starobinsky inflation and late-time acceleration. Moreover, the scale
factor corresponding to the reconstruction technique coincides almost
completely to the matter bounce scenario scale factor, when considered in the
aforementioned limiting curvature cases. This is scrutinized in detail, in
order to examine the validity of the reconstruction method in these limiting
cases, and according to our analysis, exact agreement is achieved.

(the absolute clock) whose kernel is endowed with a positive-definite metric.
Contrarily to the relativistic case, the metric structure and the torsion do
not determine a unique Galilean (i.e. compatible) connection. This subtlety is
intimately related to the fact that the timelike part of the torsion is
proportional to the exterior derivative of the absolute clock. When the latter
is not closed, torsionfreeness and metric-compatibility are thus mutually
exclusive. We will explore generalisations of Galilean connections along the
two corresponding alternative roads in a series of papers. In the present one,
we focus on compatible connections and investigate the equivalence problem

connections) in the torsionfree and torsional cases. More precisely, we
characterise the affine structure of the spaces of such connections and display
the associated model vector spaces. In contrast with the relativistic case, the
metric structure does not single out a privileged origin for the space of
metric-compatible connections. In our construction, the role of the Levi-Civita

exoplanets. To do so effectively it will be crucial to make use of all
available data. We investigate which atmospheric properties can, and cannot, be
inferred from the broadband thermal phase curve of a dry and tidally locked
terrestrial planet. First, we use dimensional analysis to show that phase
curves are controlled by six nondimensional parameters. Second, we use an
idealized general circulation model (GCM) to explore the relative sensitivity
of phase curves to these parameters. We find that the feature of phase curves
most sensitive to atmospheric parameters is the peak-to-trough amplitude.
Moreover, except for hot and rapidly rotating planets, the phase amplitude is
primarily sensitive to only two nondimensional parameters: 1) the ratio of
dynamical to radiative timescales, and 2) the longwave optical depth at the
surface. As an application of this technique, we show how phase curve
measurements can be combined with transit or emission spectroscopy to yield a
new constraint for the surface pressure and atmospheric mass of terrestrial
planets. We estimate that a single broadband phase curve, measured over half an
orbit with the James Webb Space Telescope, could meaningfully constrain the
atmospheric mass of a nearby super-Earth. Such constraints will be important
for studying the atmospheric evolution of terrestrial exoplanets as well as
characterizing the surface conditions on potentially habitable planets.

  table at end of Chapter 1",,,,"math.CO math.PR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This thesis introduces a way to build Markov chains out of Hopf algebras. The
transition matrix of a ""Hopf-power Markov chain"" is (the transpose of) the
matrix of the coproduct-then-product operator on a combinatorial Hopf algebra
with respect to a suitable basis. These chains describe the
breaking-then-recombining of the combinatorial objects in the Hopf algebra. The
motivating example is the famous Gilbert-Shannon-Reeds model of
riffle-shuffling of a deck of cards, which arises in this manner from the
shuffle algebra.
  The primary reason for constructing Hopf-power Markov chains, or for
rephrasing familiar chains through this lens, is that much information about
them comes simply from translating well-known facts on the underlying Hopf
algebra. For example, there is an explicit formula for the stationary
distribution (Theorem 4.5.1), and constructing quotient algebras show that
certain statistics on a Hopf-power Markov chain are themselves Markov chains
(Theorem 4.7.1). Perhaps the pinnacle is Theorem 2.5.1, a collection of
algorithms for a full left and right eigenbasis in many common cases where the
underlying Hopf algebra is commutative or cocommutative. This arises from a
cocktail of the Poincare-Birkhoff-Witt theorem, the Cartier-Milnor-Moore
theorem, Reutenauer's structure theory of the free Lie algebra, and Patras's
Eulerian idempotent theory.
  Since Hopf-power Markov chains can exhibit very different behaviour depending
on the structure of the underlying Hopf algebra and its distinguished basis,
one must restrict attention to certain styles of Hopf algebras in order to
obtain stronger results. This thesis will focus respectively on a
free-commutative basis, which produces ""independent breaking"" chains, and a
cofree basis; there will be both general statements and in-depth examples.

simultaneously for all $x \in \mathbb{R}^n$, $x^T L_H x = (1 \pm \epsilon) x^T
L_G x$. The $O(n \epsilon^{-2})$ bound is optimal for spectral sparsifiers. We
show that if one is interested in only preserving the value of $x^T L_G x$ for
a {\it fixed} $x \in \mathbb{R}^n$ (specified at query time) with high
probability, then there is a sketch $H$ using only $\tilde{O}(n
\epsilon^{-1.6})$ bits of space. This is the first data structure achieving a
sub-quadratic dependence on $\epsilon$. Our work builds upon recent work of
Andoni, Krauthgamer, and Woodruff who showed that $\tilde{O}(n \epsilon^{-1})$
bits of space is possible for preserving a fixed {\it cut query} (i.e., $x\in
\{0,1\}^n$) with high probability; here we show that even for a general query
vector $x \in \mathbb{R}^n$, a sub-quadratic dependence on $\epsilon$ is
possible. Our result for Laplacians is in sharp contrast to sketches for
general $n \times n$ positive semidefinite matrices $A$ with $O(\log n)$ bit
entries, for which even to preserve the value of $x^T A x$ for a fixed $x \in
\mathbb{R}^n$ (specified at query time) up to a $1+\epsilon$ factor with
constant probability, we show an $\Omega(n \epsilon^{-2})$ lower bound.

intermediate scale in addition to TeV scale and the Planck scale ($M_{\rm Pl} =

unification (GCU) is expected to be realized at $M_{\rm Pl}$. We explore
possibilities of GCU at $M_{\rm Pl}$ by adding a few extra particles with TeV
scale mass into the standard model (SM). When extra particles are fermions and
scalars (only fermions) with the same mass, the GCU at $M_{\rm Pl}$ can (not)
be realized. On the other hand, when extra fermions have different masses, the
GCU can be realized around $\sqrt{8 \pi} M_{\rm Pl}$ without extra scalars.
This simple SM extension has two advantages that a vacuum becomes stable up to
$M_{\rm Pl}$ ($\sqrt{8 \pi} M_{\rm Pl}$) and a proton lifetime becomes much
longer than an experimental bound.

kurtosis of weakly nonlinear gravity waves at deep water. For narrowband
directional spectra, the formulation is given by a sixfold integral that
depends upon the Benjamin-Feir index and the parameter
$R=\sigma_{\theta}^{2}/2\nu^{2}$, a measure of short-crestedness for the
dominant waves with $\nu$ and $\sigma_{\theta}$} denoting spectral bandwidth
and angular spreading. Our refinement leads to a new analytical solution for
the dynamic kurtosis of narrowband directional waves described with a Gaussian
type spectrum. For multidirectional or short-crested seas initially homogenous
and Gaussian, in a focusing (defocusing) regime dynamic kurtosis grows
initially, attaining a positive maximum (negative minimum) at the intrinsic
time scale \[
\tau_{c}=\nu^{2}\omega_{0}t_{c}=1/\sqrt{3R},\qquad\mathrm{or}\qquad
t_{c}/T_{0}\approx0.13/\nu\sigma_{\theta}, \] where $\omega_{0}=2\pi/T_{0}$
denotes the dominant angular frequency. Eventually the dynamic excess kurtosis
tends monotonically to zero as the wave field reaches a quasi-equilibrium state
characterized with nonlinearities mainly due to bound harmonics. Quasi-resonant
interactions are dominant only in unidirectional or long-crested seas where the
longer-time dynamic kurtosis can be larger than that induced by bound
harmonics, especially as the Benjamin-Feir index increases. Finally, we discuss
the implication of these results on the prediction of rogue waves.

waves in the nonlinear Schr\""odinger (NLS) equation on a tadpole graph (a ring
attached to a semi-infinite line subject to the Kirchhoff boundary conditions
at the junction). It is shown in the recent work [7] by using explicit Jacobi
elliptic functions that the cubic NLS equation on a tadpole graph admits a rich
structure of standing waves. Among these, there are different branches of
localized waves bifurcating from the edge of the essential spectrum of an
associated Schr\""odinger operator. We show by using a modified Lyapunov-Schmidt
reduction method that the bifur- cation of localized standing waves occurs for
every positive power nonlinearity. We distinguish a primary branch of never
vanishing standing waves bifurcating from the trivial solution and an infinite
sequence of higher branches with oscillating behavior in the ring. The higher
branches bifurcate from the branches of degenerate standing waves with
vanishing tail outside the ring. Moreover, we analyze stability of bifurcating
standing waves. Namely, we show that the primary branch is composed by
orbitally stable standing waves for subcritical power nonlinearities, while all
nontrivial higher branches are linearly unstable near the bifurcation point.
The stability character of the degenerate branches remains inconclusive at the
analytical level, whereas heuristic arguments based on analysis of embedded
eigenvalues of negative Krein signatures support the conjecture of their linear
instability at least near the bifurcation point. Numerical results for the
cubic NLS equation show that this conjecture is valid and that the degenerate
branches become spectrally stable far away from the bifurcation point.

sub-optimally solve the equivalent rank constrained problem. As a special case,
we study the problem of designing the sparsest stabilizing output feedback

these spectroscopic observations, we found that more than half (34 stars) of
our 50 targets have no evidence of binary system. We then estimated effective
temperature ($T_{\rm{eff}}$), surface gravity ($\log g$), metallicity ([Fe/H]),
and projected rotational velocity ($v\sin i$) of these 34 superflare stars on
the basis of our spectroscopic data. The accuracy of our estimations is higher

the brightness variation period ($P_{0}$) of 9 stars are in the range of
""Sun-like"" stars ($5600\leq T_{\rm{eff}}\leq 6000$K, $\log g\geq$4.0, and

10$km s$^{-1}$), while 22 stars have relatively low $v \sin i$ values ($v \sin
i<5$km s$^{-1}$). These results suggest that stars whose spectroscopic
properties similar to the Sun can have superflares, and this supports the
hypothesis that the Sun might cause a superflare.

stars with Subaru/HDS. These 50 stars were selected from the solar-type
superflare stars that we had discovered from the Kepler data. More than half
(34 stars) of these 50 target superflare stars show no evidence of binarity,
and we estimated stellar parameters of these 34 stars in our previous study
(Notsu et al. 2015, hereafter called Paper I). According to our previous
studies using Kepler data, superflare stars show quasi-periodic brightness
variations whose amplitude (0.1-10\%) is much larger than that of the solar
brightness variations (0.01-0.1\%) caused by the existence of sunspots on the
rotating solar surface. In this study, we investigated whether these
quasi-periodic brightness variations of superflare stars are explained by the
rotation of a star with fairly large starspots, by using stellar parameters
derived in Paper I. First, we confirmed that the value of the projected
rotational velocity $v \sin i$ is consistent with the rotational velocity
estimated from the period of the brightness variation. Next, we measured the
intensity of Ca II infrared triplet lines and H$\alpha$ line, good indicators
of the stellar chromospheric activity, and compared them with other stellar
properties. The intensity of Ca II infrared triplet lines indicates that the
mean magnetic field strength ($\langle fB\rangle$) of the target superflare
stars can be higher than that of the Sun. A correlation between the amplitude
of the brightness variation and the intensity of Ca II triplet line was found.
All the targets expected to have large starspots because of their large
amplitude of the brightness variation show high chromospheric activities
compared to the Sun. These results support that the brightness variation of
superflare stars is due to the rotation with large starspots.

Pachner moves. It turns out that this behaviour is controlled by an insertion
of nonlocal mixing operators. In the case of the 5-1 move, the expression
governing the change of the amplitude can be interpreted as a vertex
renormalisation equation. We find a natural truncation scheme that allows us to
get an invariance up to an overall factor for the 4-2 and 5-1 moves, but not
for the 3-3 move. The study of the divergences shows that there is a range of

Specifically, utilizing a local reformulation of the electrostatic and kernel
terms, we develop a generalized framework for performing OF-DFT simulations

propose a self-consistent field (SCF) type fixed-point method for calculations
involving linear-response kinetic energy functionals. In this framework,
evaluation of both the electronic ground-state as well as forces on the nuclei
are amenable to computations that scale linearly with the number of atoms. We
develop a parallel implementation of this formulation using the
finite-difference discretization. We demonstrate that higher-order
finite-differences can achieve relatively large convergence rates with respect
to mesh-size in both the energies and forces. Additionally, we establish that
the fixed-point iteration converges rapidly, and that it can be further
accelerated using extrapolation techniques like Anderson's mixing. We validate
the accuracy of the results by comparing the energies and forces with
plane-wave methods for selected examples, including the vacancy formation
energy in Aluminum. Overall, the suitability of the proposed formulation for
scalable high performance computing makes it an attractive choice for
large-scale OF-DFT calculations consisting of thousands of atoms.

slightly lower L/Ledd. BAL QSOs and NLS1s in general have high FeII/H$\beta$
and low [OIII]/H$\beta$ ratios following the classic 'Boroson \& Green'
eigenvector 1 relation. We also found that the mass accretion rates $\dot{M}$
of BAL QSOs and NLS1s are more similar than previously thought, although some
BAL QSOs exhibit extreme mass accretion rates of more than 10 \msun/year. These
extreme mass accretion rates may suggest that the black holes in BAL QSOs are
relativistically spinning. Black hole masses in BAL QSOs are a factor of 100
larger than NLS1s. From their location on a M-$\sigma$ plot, we find that BAL
QSOs contain fully developed black holes. Applying a principal component
analysis to our sample we find eigenvector 1 to correspond to the Eddington

curves at a barycentric period of 41.2852 s which suggests that the pulsar is
spinning-up. The pulse profiles were found to be peculiar e.g. unlike that
obtained from the earlier Suzaku observation on 2007 May 14. A single-peaked
narrow profile at soft X-rays (0.5-10 keV range) changed to a double-peaked
broad profile in 12-55 keV energy range and again reverted back to a smooth
single-peaked profile at hard X-rays (55-70 keV range). The 1.0-100.0 keV
broad-band spectrum of the pulsar was found to be well described by three
continuum models such as (i) a partial covering high energy cut-off power-law
model, (ii) a partially absorbed power-law with high-energy exponential rolloff
and (iii) a partial covering Negative and Positive power law with EXponential
(NPEX) continuum model. Unlike earlier Suzaku observation during which several
low energy emission lines were detected, a weak and narrow Iron K_alpha
emission line at 6.4 keV was only present in the pulsar spectrum during the

also introduce new programming difficulties. Since RNGs are at the base of any

observed by LHCb with a branching fraction of order $10^{-8}$. All the earlier
model predictions are too large compared with experiment. In this work, we
point out that for a given tree operator $O_i$, the contribution from its
Fiertz transformed operator, an effect often missed in the literature, tends to
cancel the internal $W$-emission amplitude induced from $O_i$. The wave
function of low-lying baryons are symmetric in momenta and the quark flavor
with the same chirality, but antisymmetric in color indices. Using these
symmetry properties and the chiral structure of weak interactions, we find that
half of the Feynman diagrams responsible for internal $W$-emission cancel.
Since this feature holds in the charmless modes but not in the charmful ones,
we advocate that the partial cancellation accounts for the smallness of the
tree-dominated charmless two-body baryonic $B$ decays. This also explains why
most previous model calculations predicted too large rates as the above
consideration was not taken into account. Finally, we emphasize that, contrary
to the claim in the literature, the internal $W$-emission tree amplitude should
be proportional to the Wilson coefficient $c_1+c_2$ rather than $c_1-c_2$.

three types. Type I wormholes have their radial pressure dying out faster, as
one moves away from the throat, than any other component of the stress-energy
and thus violate the least the local energy conditions. In type II (resp. III)
wormholes the radial and transverse pressures are asymptotically proportional
and die out faster (resp. slower) than the energy density. We introduce a novel
and generalizable method for deriving, with no cutoff in the stress-energy or
gluing, a class of each of the three wormhole types. We focus on type I
wormholes and construct different asymptotically flat solutions with finite,
upper- and lower-bounded, mass $M$. It is observed that the radial pressure is
negative, and the null energy condition is violated, only inside a narrow
layer, adjacent to the throat, of relative spacial extent $\epsilon$. Reducing
the relative size of the layer, without harming the condition of
traversability, yields an inverse square law of $\epsilon$ versus $M$ for
supermassive wormholes. We show that the diameter of the shadow of this type I

are anisotropic. They are all type III wormholes having their variable
equations of state approaching 1 and $-1$ at spatial infinity. We also

along steady and open magnetic field lines. We model the steady-state solar
atmosphere using AWSoM, a global magnetohydrodynamic model driven by Alfv{\'e}n
waves, and apply an ionization code to calculate the charge state evolution
along modeled open field lines. This constitutes the first charge states
calculation covering all latitudes in a realistic magnetic field. The ratios
$O^{+7}/O^{+6}$ and $C^{+6}/C^{+5}$ are compared to in-situ Ulysses
observations, and are found to be higher in the slow wind, as observed;
however, they are under-predicted in both wind types. The modeled ion fractions
of S, Si, and Fe are used to calculate line-of-sight intensities, which are
compared to EIS observations above a coronal hole. The agreement is partial,
and suggests that all ionization rates are under-predicted. Assuming the
presence of suprathermal electrons improved the agreement with both EIS and
Ulysses observations; importantly, the trend of higher ionization in the slow
wind was maintained. The results suggest there can be a sub-class of slow wind
that is steady and highly ionized. Further analysis shows it originates from
coronal hole boundaries (CHB), where the modeled electron density and
temperature are higher than inside the hole, leading to faster ionization. This
property of CHBs is global, and observationally supported by EUV tomography.

object of study in shear flow turbulence. When a statistical quantity was
needed it was obtained from a spatial, temporal or ensemble average of sample
realizations of the turbulence. However, there are important advantages to
studying the dynamics of the statistical state (the SSD) directly. In highly
chaotic systems statistical quantities are often the most useful and the
advantage of obtaining these statistics directly from a state variable is
obvious. Moreover, quantities such as the probability density function (pdf)
are often difficult to obtain accurately by sampling state trajectories even if
the pdf is stationary. In the event that the pdf is time dependent, solving
directly for the pdf as a state variable is the only alternative. However,
perhaps the greatest advantage of the SSD approach is conceptual: adopting this
perspective reveals directly the essential cooperative mechanisms among the
disparate spatial and temporal scales that underly the turbulent state. While
these cooperative mechanisms have distinct manifestation in the dynamics of
realizations of turbulence both these cooperative mechanisms and the phenomena
associated with them are not amenable to analysis directly through study of
realizations as they are through the study of the associated SSD. In this
review a selection of example problems in the turbulence of planetary and
laboratory flows is examined using recently developed SSD analysis methods in
order to illustrate the utility of this approach to the study of turbulence in

Specifically, PSR and TSR show very different behaviors to the variation of

when the relay moves from the source towards the destination, but for TSR, the
performance is relatively worse when the relay is placed in the middle of the
source and the destination. This is the first time to observe such a

renaissance in neural network use. For example, deep convolutional networks are
becoming the default option for difficult tasks on large datasets, such as
image and speech recognition. However, here we show that error rates below 1%
on the MNIST handwritten digit benchmark can be replicated with shallow
non-convolutional neural networks. This is achieved by training such networks
using the 'Extreme Learning Machine' (ELM) approach, which also enables a very
rapid training time (~10 minutes). Adding distortions, as is common practise
for MNIST, reduces error rates even further. Our methods are also shown to be
capable of achieving less than 5.5% error rates on the NORB image database. To
achieve these results, we introduce several enhancements to the standard ELM
algorithm, which individually and in combination can significantly improve
performance. The main innovation is to ensure each hidden-unit operates only on
a randomly sized and positioned patch of each image. This form of random
`receptive field' sampling of the input ensures the input weight matrix is
sparse, with about 90% of weights equal to zero. Furthermore, combining our
methods with a small number of iterations of a single-batch backpropagation
method can significantly reduce the number of hidden-units required to achieve
a particular performance. Our close to state-of-the-art results for MNIST and
NORB suggest that the ease of use and accuracy of the ELM algorithm for
designing a single-hidden-layer neural network classifier should cause it to be
given greater consideration either as a standalone method for simpler problems,
or as the final classification stage in deep neural networks applied to more
difficult problems.

non-monotonously as a function of alloy composition, with the transition from

absorption fine structure (XAFS) spectroscopy, associated with electron
paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and optical emission spectroscopy, it is shown
that an increase in antisite defects concentration results in a decrease in the
Cr-O bond length and the octahedral crystal field energy. A part of the defects
are in the close environment of Cr$^{3+}$ ions, as shown by the increasing
strain broadening of EPR and XAFS peaks observed upon increasing antisite

field splitting of Cr$^{3+}$ and the smallest antisite disorder, does not show
considerable persistent luminescence upon visible light excitation as compared

The sound velocity of liquid Bi was measured into the supercooled region to

60 degrees, from 35 degrees above the melting point to ca. 25 degrees into the

of the sentence length variability (SLV) in a large corpus of world-famous
literary texts shows that an appealing and aesthetic optimum appears somewhere
in between and involves selfsimilar, cascade-like alternation of various
lengths sentences. A related quantitative observation is that the power spectra
S(f) of thus characterized SLV universally develop a convincing `1/f^beta'
scaling with the average exponent beta =~ 1/2, close to what has been
identified before in musical compositions or in the brain waves. An
overwhelming majority of the studied texts simply obeys such fractal attributes
but especially spectacular in this respect are hypertext-like, ""stream of

characteristic of irreducibly interwoven sets of fractals called multifractals.
Scaling of S(f) in the present context implies existence of the long-range
correlations in texts and appearance of multifractality indicates that they
carry even a nonlinear component. A distinct role of the full stops in inducing
the long-range correlations in texts is evidenced by the fact that the above
quantitative characteristics on the long-range correlations manifest themselves
in variation of the full stops recurrence times along texts, thus in SLV, but
to a much lesser degree in the recurrence times of the most frequent words. In
this latter case the nonlinear correlations, thus multifractality, disappear
even completely for all the texts considered. Treated as one extra word, the
full stops at the same time appear to obey the Zipfian rank-frequency
distribution, however.

Faraday rotation in the near-side thermal halo of the galaxy. Thus, the scale

qubit systems from elementary rules on information acquisition. The focus lies
on an observer O interrogating a system S with binary questions and S's state
is taken as O's `catalogue of knowledge' about S. The mathematical tools of the
framework are simple and we attempt to highlight all underlying assumptions.
Four rules are imposed, asserting (1) a limit on the amount of information
available to O; (2) the mere existence of complementary information; (3) O's
total amount of information to be preserved in-between interrogations; and, (4)
O's `catalogue of knowledge' to change continuously in time in-between
interrogations and every consistent such evolution to be possible. This
approach permits a constructive derivation of quantum theory, elucidating how
the ensuing independence, complementarity and compatibility structure of O's
questions matches that of projective measurements in quantum theory, how
entanglement and monogamy of entanglement, non-locality and, more generally,
how the correlation structure of arbitrarily many qubits and rebits arises. The
rules yield a reversible time evolution and a quadratic measure, quantifying
O's information about S. Finally, it is shown that the four rules admit two
solutions for the simplest case of a single elementary system: the Bloch ball
and disc as state spaces for a qubit and rebit, respectively, together with
their symmetries as time evolution groups. The reconstruction for arbitrarily
many qubits is completed in a companion paper (arXiv:1511.01130) where an
additional rule eliminates the rebit case. This approach is inspired by (but
does not rely on) the relational interpretation and yields a novel formulation
of quantum theory in terms of questions.

non-commutativity rather than entanglement. Two measures of quantum discord by
the amount of non-commutativity via the trace norm and the Hilbert-Schmidt norm

easily for any state with arbitrary dimension. It is shown by several examples
that these measures can reflect the amount of the original quantum discord.

small perturbation of one of the three ground states.

matrix elements belonging to two different columns are equal. There are three
such possibilities, all of which are disfavored by the latest neutrino
oscillation data. We focus on the specific scenario which predicts vanishing
reactor mixing angle $\theta_{13}$ and inverted hierarchy with vanishing
lightest neutrino mass. Motivated by several recent attempts to explain
non-zero $\theta_{13}$ by incorporating corrections to a leading order neutrino
mass or mixing matrix giving $\theta_{13}=0$, here we study the origin of
non-zero $\theta_{13}$ as well as leptonic Dirac CP phase $\delta_{CP}$ by
incorporating two different corrections to scaling neutrino mass and mixing:
one where type II seesaw acts as a correction to scaling neutrino mass matrix
and the other with charged lepton correction to scaling neutrino mixing.
Although scaling neutrino mass matrix originating from type I seesaw predicts
inverted hierarchy, the total neutrino mass matrix after type II seesaw
correction can give rise to either normal or inverted hierarchy. However,
charged lepton corrections do not disturb the inverted hierarchy prediction of
scaling neutrino mass matrix. We further discriminate between neutrino
hierarchies, different choices of lightest neutrino mass and Dirac CP phase by
calculating baryon asymmetry and comparing with the observations made by the

of quantum mechanics are presented. Our explanation is based on an analogy of
quantum wave-particle duality with bouncing droplets in an oscillating medium,
the latter being identified as the vacuum's zero-point field. A hydrodynamic
analogy of a similar type has recently come under criticism by Richardson et
al., because despite striking similarities at a phenomenological level the
governing equations related to the force on the particle are evidently
different for the hydrodynamic and the quantum descriptions, respectively.
However, said differences are not relevant if a radically different use of said
analogy is being made, thereby essentially referring to emergent processes in
our model. If the latter are taken into account, one can show that the forces
on the particles are identical in both the dBB and our model. In particular,
this identity results from an exact matching of our emergent velocity field
with the Bohmian ""guiding equation"". One thus arrives at an explanation
involving a deeper, i.e. subquantum, level of the dBB version of quantum
mechanics. We show in particular how the classically-local approach of the
usual hydrodynamical modeling can be overcome and how, as a consequence, the
configuration-space version of dBB theory for $N$ particles can be completely
substituted by a ""superclassical"" emergent dynamics of $N$ particles in real
3-dimensional space.

The data obtained at room temperature reveal structural distortions arising

Spin-phonon coupling was evidenced from the Raman results. The temperature
dependence of the B1g in-plane O2 stretching mode of the MnO6 octahedron has
revealed either a positive or negative shift regarding the pure anharmonic
temperature dependence of the phonon frequency, which strongly depends on the
Y-concentration. The frequency renormalization is explained in terms of a
competition between ferro and antiferromagnetic interactions. The ratio between
the spin-phonon coupling constant and the effective magnetic exchange integral

is based on the fact that the ring methylene protons of cyclic fatty acids
(constituting the cell membrane of several species of bacteria and
mycobacteria) resonate specifically between -0.40 and 0.68 ppm region of the 1H
NMR spectrum. These cyclic fatty acids are rarely found in the eukaryotic cell
membranes. Therefore, the signals from cyclic ring moiety of these fatty acids
can be used as markers (a) for the identification of bacterial and
mycobacterial infections and (b) for differential diagnosis of bacterial and
fungal infections. However, these microbial fatty acids when present inside the
membrane are not easily detectable by NMR owing to their fast T2 relaxation.
Nonetheless, the problem can easily be circumvented if these fatty acids become
suspended in solution. This has been achieved by abolishing the membrane
integrity using broad spectrum antibiotics (including ampicillin). The
suspended fatty acids are then detected by NMR to probe the infection.
Therefore, the method has been given the name AADNMR i.e. Add Antibiotic to
Detect by NMR. The method has been tested here using both Gram positive and
Gram negative bacterial strains and finally the utility of method is
demonstrated for discriminating bacterial and fungal infections to aid timely
diagnosis of infectious peritonitis (a life threatening complication associated

the third millennium, in which the need for non-polluting and renewable

promising, since the energy released in its oxidation (~285 kJ/mole) is three
times that released, on average, by hydrocarbons, and the combustion product is
water (Ramage, 1983). Being hydrogen a vector of chemical energy, efficient
conservation and non-dispersive transportation are the main goals. Three issues
must be considered to this respect: (i) storage capacity (ii) storage stability
(iii) kinetics of loading/release. Commercial technologies are currently based
on cryo-compression or liquefaction of H2 in tanks. These ensure quite a high
gravimetric density (GD, point (i)), namely 8-13% in weight of stored hydrogen,
and a relatively low cost (Z\""uttel 2003). However concerning points (ii) and
(iii), these technologies pose problems of safety, mainly due to explosive
flammability of hydrogen, and consequent unpractical conditions for
transportation and use (Mori et al 2009). Therefore, research efforts are
directed towards solid-state based storage systems (energy.gov, Bonaccorso et

deterministic ones. Usually, their efficiency and correctness are analyzed
using probabilistic tools under the assumption that the inputs and queries are
independent of the internal randomness of the data structure. In this work, we
consider data structures in a more robust model, which we call the adversarial
model. Roughly speaking, this model allows an adversary to choose inputs and
queries adaptively according to previous responses. Specifically, we consider a
data structure known as ""Bloom filter"" and prove a tight connection between
Bloom filters in this model and cryptography.
  A Bloom filter represents a set $S$ of elements approximately, by using fewer
bits than a precise representation. The price for succinctness is allowing some
errors: for any $x \in S$ it should always answer `Yes', and for any $x \notin
S$ it should answer `Yes' only with small probability.
  In the adversarial model, we consider both efficient adversaries (that run in
polynomial time) and computationally unbounded adversaries that are only
bounded in the number of queries they can make. For computationally bounded
adversaries, we show that non-trivial (memory-wise) Bloom filters exist if and
only if one-way functions exist. For unbounded adversaries we show that there
exists a Bloom filter for sets of size $n$ and error $\varepsilon$, that is
secure against $t$ queries and uses only $O(n \log{\frac{1}{\varepsilon}}+t)$
bits of memory. In comparison, $n\log{\frac{1}{\varepsilon}}$ is the best
possible under a non-adaptive adversary.

  We improve the best general upper bound for reset thresholds of finite prefix

that the expected reset threshold of a uniformly random synchronizing binary

results of Nicaud, we show that the probability that the \v{C}ern\'y conjecture

small in terms of the number of states, and also that the expected value of the

through both static and dynamic event-triggering approach to reduce the
computation and communication usages. Proposed control strategies ensure
stability in the presence of bounded matched and unmatched system
uncertainties. Derivation of event-triggering rule with a non-zero positive
inter-event time and corresponding stability criteria for uncertain
event-triggered system are the key contributions of this paper. The efficacy of
proposed algorithm is carried out through a comparative study of simulation
results.

remains elusive. If Hawking radiation does not carry any information out from
the ever shrinking black hole, it seems that unitarity is violated once the
black hole completely evaporates. On the other hand, attempts to recover
information via quantum entanglement lead to the firewall controversy. Amid the
confusions, the possibility that black hole evaporation stops with a ""remnant""
has remained unpopular and is often dismissed due to some ""undesired
properties"" of such an object. Nevertheless, as in any scientific debate, the
pros and cons of any proposal must be carefully scrutinized. We fill in the
void of the literature by providing a timely review of various types of black
hole remnants, and provide some new thoughts regarding the challenges that
black hole remnants face in the context of the information loss paradox and its
latest incarnation, namely the firewall controversy. The importance of
understanding the role of curvature singularity is also emphasized, after all
there remains a possibility that the singularity cannot be cured even by
quantum gravity. In this context a black hole remnant conveniently serves as a
cosmic censor. We conclude that a remnant remains a possible end state of
Hawking evaporation, and if it contains large interior geometry, may help to
ameliorate the information loss paradox and the firewall controversy. We hope
that this will raise some interests in the community to investigate remnants
more critically but also more thoroughly.

For example, scalar multiplication is conserved by the transport equation,

Certain discretization techniques, such as particle based methods, conserve
these properties, but converge slower than spectral discretization methods on
smooth data. Standard spectral discretization methods, on the other hand, do
not conserve the invariants of the transport equation and the continuum

analyzing the properties of the transmitted light using scattering theory. To
this end, we employ the Lippmann-Schwinger formalism within which an analytical
form of the scattering matrix can be found. The latter is evaluated explicitly
for the two particle/photon-two site case using which we study the resonance
properties of two-photon scattering, as well as the scattering probabilities

results indicate that the underlying structure of the many-body states of the

transported photons in its QCA realization. We find that a fully-resonant
two-photon scattering scenario allows a faithful characterization of the
underlying many-body states, unlike in the coherent driving scenario usually
employed in quantum Master equation treatments. The effects of losses in the
cavities, as well as the incoming photons' pulse shapes and initial
correlations are studied and analyzed. Our method is general and can be applied

that dark photons comprise the dominant fraction of dark matter. This

in non-thermal electron distribution functions that strongly affect transport
properties. Results are presented for the Hall conductance for two different
cases. One is for a closed system such as a cold-atomic gas where transverse
drift due to non-zero Berry curvature can be measured in time of flight
measurements. For this case the effect of a circularly polarized laser that has
been switched on suddenly is studied. The second is for an open system coupled
to an external reservoir of phonons. While for the former, the Hall conductance
is far from the quantized limit, for the latter, coupling to a sufficiently low
temperature reservoir of phonons is found to produce effective cooling, and
thus an approach to the quantum limit, provided the frequency of the laser is
large as compared to the band-width. For laser frequencies comparable to the
band-width, strong deviations from the quantum limit of conductance is found
even for a very low temperature reservoir, with the precise value of the Hall
conductance determined by a competition between reservoir induced cooling and
the excitation of photo-carriers by the laser. For the closed system, the
electron distribution function is determined by the overlap between the initial
wavefunction and the Floquet states which can result in a Hall conductance
which is opposite in sign to that of the open system.

spiral orbit into the Schwarzschild black hole was found. The characteristic
features in this electromagnetic spectrum can be used for determine of the
black hole mass by the new way. This new way (if implemented) provides higher
accuracy in determining of the black hole mass. Also these features in the
spectrum can be used for determine of the certain characteristics in the black
hole magnetosphere or in the accretion disk characteristics around the black
hole. It is also shown that the asymptotic behavior of this spectrum (at high
frequencies) is practically independent from the impact parameter of the
falling dipole.

  Diameters (Candidate-Degree Dissertation Author's Review, in Russian)","16 pages, in Russian, candidate-degree dissertation author's review,
  Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology (State University), November 2014,
  adviser: A. M. Raigorodskii",,,,"math.CO math.MG math.PR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The dissertation is related to combinatorial geometry with a strong
probabilistic flavor. The main results can be split into three parts. The
results of the first part guarantee that each ""unit distance graph"" in the
plane has an induced subgraph with chromatic number at most 4 that covers at
least 91.7 percent of the vertices of the whole graph.
  The results of the second and third parts are related to the standard model
of a random graph with n labeled vertices in which the edges occur
independently with probability p, where p is a function of n. This is known as
the Erdos--Renyi model G(n,p). Given a monotone property of a graph, Erdos and
Renyi's theorem (1960) states that there exists a critical threshold value of
p(n) below which the probability that a random graph has that property tends to
one (as n tends to infinity) and above which the probability tends to zero.
  The main results of the second part are concerned with the (monotone)
property of a graph to be isomorphic to some unit-distance graph in Euclidean
d-space with fixed dimension d. The results of this part guarantee that for d
in {2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}, the threshold value of p(n) is big-Theta of 1/n.
Furthermore, the case d = 1 stands apart from the case of higher dimensions;
here the threshold probability is big-Theta of 1/(n^(4/3)).
  The results of the third part are devoted to studying ""graphs of diameters""
from the probabilistic standpoint. In particular, it is shown that under some
conditions, almost all graphs of diameters in the plane have chromatic number
less than 3. More generally, it is shown for G(n,p) that graphs of diameters
have a tendency to chromatic degeneration (for large n) when p is close to 0,
but have a tendency to completeness when p is close to 1.
