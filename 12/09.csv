  Maxwell's equations",,,,,"math.NA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We consider the discretization of electromagnetic wave propagation problems
by a discontinuous Galerkin Method based on Trefftz polynomials. This method
fits into an abstract framework for space-time discontinuous Galerkin methods
for which we can prove consistency, stability, and energy dissipation without
the need to completely specify the approximation spaces in detail. Any method
of such a general form results in an implicit time-stepping scheme with some
basic stability properties. For the local approximation on each space-time
element, we then consider Trefftz polynomials, i.e., the subspace of
polynomials that satisfy Maxwell's equations exactly on the respective element.
We present an explicit construction of a basis for the local Trefftz spaces in
two and three dimensions and summarize some of their basic properties. Using
local properties of the Trefftz polynomials, we can establish the
well-posedness of the resulting discontinuous Galerkin Trefftz method.
Consistency, stability, and energy dissipation then follow immediately from the
results about the abstract framework. The method proposed in this paper
therefore shares many of the advantages of more standard discontinuous Galerkin
methods, while at the same time, it yields a substantial reduction in the
number of degrees of freedom and the cost for assembling. These benefits and
the spectral convergence of the scheme are demonstrated in numerical tests.

Spectrum Radio Quasar (FSRQ) classes. Our model has been optimized so that it
reproduces the MOJAVE distributions of apparent speeds and redshifts when the
appropriate flux limit is applied and a uniform distribution of jet viewing
angles is assumed for the population. Here we use this model to predict the
Doppler factor distribution for various flux-limited samples for which Doppler
factors have been estimated in a variety of ways (equipartition, variability +
equipartition, inverse Compton dominance) on a blazar-by-blazar basis. By
comparing the simulated and data-estimated Doppler factor distributions in each
case, we evaluate the different methods of estimating blazar Doppler factors.
We find that the variability Doppler factors assuming equipartition are the
ones in the best agreement with our statistical model, whereas the inverse
Compton Doppler factor method is only suitable for FSRQs. In the case of
variability Doppler factors, we find that while random errors are relatively
low ($\sim 30\%$), uncertainties are dominated by systematic effects. In the
case of inverse Compton Doppler factors, random errors appear to dominate, but
are significantly larger ($\sim 60\%$).

starting from equilibrium conditions that are either topologically trivial or
only support individual Majorana pairs. In the first approach, a suitable
modulation of the chemical potential simultaneously induces Majorana flat bands

for their protection. In the second approach, the application of effective
parity kicks dynamically $generates$ a desired chiral symmetry by suppressing

the use of time-dependent control enlarges the range of possibilities for

test interaction, we here present the measurement of the force between the tip
and the surface, together with the measurement of the interaction stiffness and
the associated dissipation. These three quantities constitute a full
characterization of the interaction at nanoscale. They are measured
independently, simultaneously and quantitatively at the same place. This is
made possible thanks to a force feedback method that ensures the DC immobility
of the tip and to the simultaneous application of a sub-nanometer oscillation
to the tip. In this established linear regime, stiffness and damping are
directly obtained from amplitude and phase change measurements. The needed
information for this linear transformation is solely the lever properties in
the experimental context. Knowledge of k, its stiffness, its damping
coefficient and Q0, its first resonance frequency is shown to be sufficient in
the frequency range we are here exploring. Finally, we demonstrate that this
method is not restricted to the lever resonance frequency. To the contrary,
this interaction characterization whose resolution is limited by the Brownian
motion, can be used at any frequencies with essentially the same performances.
We believe that simultaneous and independent measurements of force, stiffness
and damping, out of lever resonance, at nanoscale, and within the context of
linear response define a new AFM paradigm that we call Force Feedback
Microscopy (FFM). This article details the use of FFM using a well known and
easy to implement electrostatic interaction between a regular AFM tip and a

the tail probabilities of the coupling time attain the total variation lower
bound (Aldous bound) uniformly for all time. Markovian (or immersion) couplings
are couplings defined by strategies where neither process is allowed to look
into the future of the other before making the next transition. Markovian
couplings are typically easier to construct and analyze than general couplings,
and play an important role in many branches of probability and analysis. Hsu
and Sturm (2013) proved that the reflection-coupling of Brownian motion is the
unique Markovian maximal coupling (MMC) of Brownian motions starting from two
different points. Later, Kuwada (2009) proved that the existence of a MMC for
Brownian motions on a Riemannian manifold enforces existence of a reflection
structure on the manifold. In this work, we investigate suitably regular
elliptic diffusions on manifolds, and show how consideration of the diffusion
geometry (including dimension of the isometry group and flows of isometries) is
fundamental in classification of the space and the generator of the diffusion
for which an MMC exists, especially when the MMC also holds under local
perturbations of the starting points for the coupled diffusions. We also
describe such diffusions in terms of Killing vectorfields (generators of
isometry groups) and dilation vectorfields (generators of scaling symmetry
groups).

radiation from wigglers, one needs to account for the so called
`depth-of-field' effects. In fact, the particle beam cross section varies along
the wiggler. It is usually stated that the effective photon source size
increases accordingly, while the brightness is reduced. Here we claim that this
is a misconception originating from an analysis of the wiggler source based on
geometrical arguments, regarded as almost self-evident. According to
electrodynamics, depth-of-field effects do not exist: we demonstrate this
statement both theoretically and numerically, using a well-known
first-principle computer code. This fact shows that under the usually accepted
approximations, the description of the wiggler brightness turns out to be
inconsistent even qualitatively. Therefore, there is a need for a well-defined
procedure for computing the brightness from a wiggler source. We accomplish
this task based on the use of a Wigner function formalism. In the geometrical
optics limit computations can be performed analytically. Within this limit, we
restrict ourselves to the case of the beam size-dominated regime, which is
typical for synchrotron radiation facilities in the X-ray wavelength range. We
give a direct demonstration of the fact that the apparent horizontal source
size is broadened in proportion to the beamline opening angle and to the length
of the wiggler. While this effect is well-understood, a direct proof appears
not to have been given elsewhere. We consider the problem of the calculation of
the wiggler source size by means of numerical simulations alone, which play the
same role of an experiment. We report a significant numerical disagreement
between exact calculations and approximations currently used in literature.

the trajectory in a fixed direction {$\theta \in ]0,\pi/2[$}, which can be
shown to yield the mean perimeter by integration over $\theta$, presents these
same two characteristics. This is in striking contrast with the one dimensional
case, where the mean span is an increasing analytical function. The
non-monotonicity in the 2D case originates from the competition between two
antagonistic effects due to the presence of the wall: reduction of the space

suggested that laser pulses with a suitable frequency modulation could

nonlinear Compton scattering in a frequency modulated intense laser pulse. We
systematically derive the optimal frequency modulation of the laser pulse from
the scattering matrix element of nonlinear Compton scattering, taking into

computing graph distances in the Congested Clique model. One of the main
components of our algorithms is fast matrix multiplication, for which we show
an $O(n^{1/3})$-round algorithm when the multiplication needs to be performed
over a semi-ring, and an $O(n^{0.157})$-round algorithm when the computation
can be performed over a field. We propose to denote by $\kappa$ the exponent of
matrix multiplication in this model, which gives $\kappa < 0.157$.
  We show how to compute all-pairs-shortest-paths (APSP) in $O(n^{1/3}\log{n})$
rounds in weighted graphs of $n$ nodes, implying also the computation of the
graph diameter $D$. In unweighted graphs, APSP can be computed in
$O(\min\{n^{1/3}\log{D},n^{\kappa} D\})$ rounds, and the diameter can be
computed in $O(n^{\kappa}\log{D})$ rounds. Furthermore, we show how to compute
the girth of a graph in $O(n^{1/3})$ rounds, and provide triangle detection and
4-cycle detection algorithms that complete in $O(n^{\kappa})$ rounds.
  All our algorithms are deterministic. Our triangle detection and 4-cycle
detection algorithms improve upon the previously best known algorithms in this
model, and refute a conjecture that $\tilde \Omega (n^{1/3})$ rounds are
required for detecting triangles by any deterministic oblivious algorithm. Our
distance computation algorithms are exact, and improve upon the previously best
known $\tilde O(n^{1/2})$ algorithm of Nanongkai [STOC 2014] for computing a
$(2+o(1))$-approximation of APSP.
  Finally, we give lower bounds that match the above for natural families of
algorithms. For the Congested Clique Broadcast model, we derive unconditioned
lower bounds for matrix multiplication and APSP. The matrix multiplication
algorithms and lower bounds are adapted from parallel computations, which is a
connection of independent interest.

previously known results for $n = 1$ to all $n \ge 1$, and also observes new

logarithmic corrections to scaling for certain correlation functions. Our
method gives a rigorous analysis of the weakly self-avoiding walk as the $n =

valence quarks is possible. For hadrons with beauty valence quarks a promising
strategy is the measurement of their decay electrons. To separate these from
the background electrons (mainly from charm hadron decays, photon conversions
or light-meson decays) the large decay length of beauty hadrons can be
utilized. It leads to a relatively large typical impact parameter of the decay
electrons. By comparing the impact parameter distribution of the signal
electrons with those from the background sources, the signal can be
statistically separated from the background. For this purpose a maximum
likelihood fit is employed using impact parameter distribution templates from

fields including sparse signal recovery in compressed sensing (CS), statistics,
and machine learning. Traditional convex models suffer from the suboptimal
performance though enjoying tractable computation. In this paper, we propose a
new non-convex joint sparsity model, and develop a corresponding multi-stage
adaptive convex relaxation algorithm. This method extends the idea of iterative
support detection (ISD) from the single vector estimation to the multi-vector
estimation by considering the joint sparsity prior. We provide some preliminary
theoretical analysis including convergence analysis and a sufficient recovery
condition. Numerical experiments from both compressive sensing and feature
learning show the better performance of the proposed method in comparison with
several state-of-the-art alternatives. Moreover, we demonstrate that the
extension of ISD from the single vector to multi-vector estimation is not
trivial. In particular, while ISD does not work well for reconstructing the
signal channel sparse Bernoulli signal, it does achieve significantly improved
performance when recovering the multi-channel sparse Bernoulli signal thanks to
its ability of natural incorporation of the joint sparsity structure.

specifically, we scatter two solitons off of each other (in our setup, the
bright solitons play the role of a classical analogue to the quantum photons of
the original experiment), while the role of the beam splitter is played by a
repulsive Gaussian barrier. In our classical scenario, distinguishability of
the particles yields, as expected, a $0.5$ split mass on either side.
Nevertheless, for very slight deviations from the completely symmetric scenario
a near-perfect transmission i.e., a $|2,0>e$ or a $|0,2 >$ state can be
constructed instead, very similarly to the quantum mechanical output. We
demonstrate this as a generic feature under slight variations of the relative
soliton speed, or of the relative amplitude in a wide parametric regime. We
also explore how variations of the properties of the ""beam splitter"" (i.e., the
Gaussian barrier) affect this phenomenology.

the basis of realistic two- and three-nucleon interactions. Several routes to
address open-shell nuclei are currently under investigation, including ideas
which exploit spontaneous symmetry breaking. Singly open-shell nuclei can be
efficiently described via the sole breaking of $U(1)$ gauge symmetry associated
with particle number conservation, to account for their superfluid character.
The present work formulates and applies Bogoliubov coupled cluster (BCC)
theory, which consists of representing the exact ground-state wavefunction of
the system as the exponential of a quasiparticle excitation cluster operator
acting on a Bogoliubov reference state. Equations for the ground-state energy
and cluster amplitudes are derived at the singles and doubles level (BCCSD)
both algebraically and diagrammatically. The formalism includes three-nucleon
forces at the normal-ordered two-body level. The first BCC code is implemented
in $m$-scheme, which will eventually permit the treatment of doubly open-shell
nuclei. Proof-of-principle calculations in an $N_{\text{max}}=6$ spherical
harmonic oscillator basis are performed for $^{16,18,20}$O, $^{18}$Ne,
$^{20}$Mg in the BCCD approximation with a chiral two-nucleon interaction,
comparing to results obtained in standard coupled cluster theory when
applicable. The breaking of $U(1)$ symmetry is monitored by computing the
variance associated with the particle-number operator. The newly developed
many-body formalism increases the potential span of ab initio calculations
based on single-reference coupled cluster techniques tremendously, i.e.
potentially to reach several hundred additional mid-mass nuclei. The new
formalism offers a wealth of potential applications and further extensions
dedicated to the description of ground and excited states of open-shell nuclei.

atmospheric parameters and nitrogen (N) abundances for 34 single and 18 binary
B-type supergiants (BSGs). The effects of flux contribution from an unseen
secondary were considered for the binary sample. We present the first
systematic study of the incidence of binarity for a sample of BSGs across the
theoretical terminal age main sequence (TAMS). To account for the distribution
of effective temperatures of the BSGs it may be necessary to extend the TAMS to
lower temperatures. This is consistent with the derived distribution of mass
discrepancies, projected rotational velocities (vsini) and N abundances,
provided that stars cooler than this temperature are post RSG objects. For the
BSGs in the Tarantula and previous FLAMES surveys, most have small vsini. About
10% have larger vsini (>100 km/s) but surprisingly these show little or no N
enhancement. All the cooler BSGs have low vsini of <70km/s and high N abundance
estimates, implying that either bi-stability braking or evolution on a blue
loop may be important. A lack of cool binaries, possibly reflects the small
sample size. Single star evolutionary models, which include rotation, can
account for the N enhancement in both the single and binary samples. The
detailed distribution of N abundances in the single and binary samples may be
different, possibly reflecting differences in their evolutionary history. The
first comparative study of single and binary BSGs has revealed that the main
sequence may be significantly wider than previously assumed, extending to
Teff=20000K. Some marginal differences in single and binary atmospheric
parameters and abundances have been identified, possibly implying non-standard
evolution for some of the sample. This sample as a whole has implications for
several aspects of our understanding of the evolution of BSGs. Full abstract in

four-dimensional data set (three {\bf Q} and one energy) that is both
comprehensive and spans a large region of reciprocal space. Our measurements
identify rich structure in the energy dependence of the highly dispersive spin
excitations, which are centered at equivalent ($\frac{1}{2},\frac{1}{2}, L$)
wave-vectors. These structures correlate strongly with several crossings of the
spin excitations with the lightly dispersive phonons found in this system.
These effects are significant and account for on the order of 25$\%$ of the
total inelastic scattering for energies between $\sim$5 and 40 meV at low
$|{\bf Q}|$. Interestingly, this scattering also presents little or no
$L$-dependence. As the phonons and dispersive spin excitations centered at
equivalent ($\frac{1}{2},\frac{1}{2}, L$) wave-vectors are common to all
members of La-based 214 copper oxides, we conclude such strong quasi-two

characteristic of these materials and is potentially related to superconducting

that if for each user the desired signal strength is no less than the sum of
the strengths of the strongest interference from this user and the strongest
interference to this user (all values in dB scale), then power control and
treating interference as noise (TIN) is optimal from the perspective of
generalized degrees of freedom (GDoF) and achieves the entire channel capacity
region to within a constant gap. In this work, we generalize the optimality of
TIN to compound networks. We show that for a K-user compound Gaussian
interference channel, if in every possible state for each receiver, the channel
always satisfies the TIN-optimality condition identified by Geng et al., then
the GDoF region of the compound channel is the intersection of the GDoF regions
of all possible network realizations, which is achievable by power control and
TIN. Furthermore, we demonstrate that for a general K-user compound
interference channel, regardless of the number of states of each receiver, we
can always construct a counterpart K-user regular interference channel that has
the same TIN region as the original compound channel. The regular interference
channel has only one state for each receiver, which may be different from all
of the original states. Solving the GDoF-based power control problem for the
compound channel is equivalent to solving the same problem in its regular
counterpart. Exploring the power control problem further we develop a
centralized power control scheme for K-user compound interference channels, to
achieve all the Pareto optimal GDoF tuples. Finally, based on this scheme, we
devise an iterative power control algorithm which requires at most K updates to
obtain the globally optimal power allocation for any feasible GDoF tuple.

focus on a set of observational targets that describe the evolution of the
global and structural properties of galaxies from roughly Cosmic High Noon
($z\sim 2-3$) to the present. Although minor discrepancies remain, overall,
models show remarkable convergence between different methods and make
predictions that are in qualitative agreement with observations. Modelers seem
to have converged on a core set of physical processes that are critical for
shaping galaxy properties. This core set includes cosmological accretion,
strong stellar-driven winds that are more efficient at low masses, black hole
feedback that preferentially suppresses star formation at high masses, and
structural and morphological evolution through merging and environmental
processes. However, all cosmological models currently adopt phenomenological
implementations of many of these core processes, which must be tuned to
observations. Many details of how these diverse processes interact within a
hierarchical structure formation setting remain poorly understood. Emerging
multi-scale simulations are helping to bridge the gap between stellar and
cosmological scales, placing models on a firmer, more physically grounded
footing. Concurrently, upcoming telescope facilities will provide new
challenges and constraints for models, particularly by directly constraining
inflows and outflows through observations of gas in and around galaxies.

surface states of 3D topological insulators (TI),it is necessary to open a
""Dirac-mass gap"" in their spectrum by breaking time-reversal symmetry. Use of
magnetic dopant atoms to generate a ferromagnetic state is the most widely used
approach. But it is unknown how the spatial arrangements of the magnetic dopant
atoms influence the Dirac-mass gap at the atomic scale or, conversely, whether
the ferromagnetic interactions between dopant atoms are influenced by the
topological surface states. Here we image the locations of the magnetic (Cr)
dopant atoms in the ferromagnetic TI
Cr$_{0.08}$(Bi$_{0.1}$Sb$_{0.9}$)$_{1.92}$Te$_3$. Simultaneous visualization of
the Dirac-mass gap $\Delta(r)$ reveals its intense disorder, which we
demonstrate directly is related to fluctuations in $n(r)$, the Cr atom areal
density in the termination layer. We find the relationship of surface-state
Fermi wavevectors to the anisotropic structure of $\Delta(r)$ consistent with
predictions for surface ferromagnetism mediated by those states. Moreover,
despite the intense Dirac-mass disorder, the anticipated relationship
$\Delta(r)\propto n(r)$ is confirmed throughout, and exhibits an
electron-dopant interaction energy $J^*$=145$meV\cdot nm^2$. These observations
reveal how magnetic dopant atoms actually generate the TI mass gap locally and
that, to achieve the novel physics expected of time-reversal-symmetry breaking
TI materials, control of the resulting Dirac-mass gap disorder will be
essential.

This is in part because research on signed network analysis suggests that

in their effective use is that most social media sites do not enable users to
specify them explicitly. In other words, a gap exists between the importance of
negative links and their availability in real data sets. Therefore, it is
natural to explore whether one can predict negative links automatically from
the commonly available social network data. In this paper, we investigate the
novel problem of negative link prediction with only positive links and
content-centric interactions in social media. We make a number of important
observations about negative links, and propose a principled framework NeLP,
which can exploit positive links and content-centric interactions to predict
negative links. Our experimental results on real-world social networks
demonstrate that the proposed NeLP framework can accurately predict negative

fermion fields known as the sQED theory. We find that the Coulomb gauge in the
instant form dynamics (IFD) and the light-front gauge in the front form
dynamics, or the light-front dynamics (LFD), are naturally linked by the
unified general physical gauge that interpolates between these two forms of
dynamics and derive the spin-1 polarization vector for the photon that can be
generally applicable for any interpolation angle. Corresponding photon
propagator for an arbitrary interpolation angle is found and examined in terms
of the gauge field polarization and the interpolating time ordering. Using
these results, we calculate the lowest-order scattering processes for an
arbitrary interpolation angle in sQED. We provide an example of breaking the
reflection symmetry under the longitudinal boost, $P^z \leftrightarrow -P^z$,
for the time-ordered scattering amplitude in any interpolating dynamics except
the LFD and clarify the confusion in the prevailing notion of the equivalence
between the infinite momentum frame (IMF) and the LFD. The particular
correlation found in our previous analysis of the scattering amplitude in the
simple scalar field theory, coined as the J-shaped correlation, between the
total momentum of the system and the interpolation angle persists in the
present analysis of the sQED scattering amplitude. We discuss the singular
behavior of this correlation in conjunction with the zero-mode issue in the
LFD.

basing on analytical and numerical calculations of kinetic equations which
describe processes of particle propagation and their energy losses. The origin
of gamma rays could be either due to collisions of relativistic protons with
the dense gas of the surrounding circumnuclear disk (CND) or bremsstrahlung and
inverse Compton scattering of relativistic electrons. The hydrogen ionization
in this case is produced by a low energy component of the CR spectrum. We found
that if ionization is produced by protons the expected ionization rate of
hydrogen in the CND is of the same order as derived from IR observations. So we
do not see any discrepancy between the gamma-ray and ionization data for the
hadronic model. In the case of ionization by electrons we obtained the
ionization rate one order of magnitude higher than follows from the IR data. In
principle, a selection between the leptonic and hadronic interpretations can be
performed basing on measurements of radio and X-ray fluxes from this region
because the leptonic and hadronic models give different values of the fluxes
from there. We do not exclude that gamma-ray production and hydrogen ionization
in the CND are due to a past activity of Sgr A* which occurred about 100 year

locations (random), in a combination of both (mixed), or clustered in space and
time (clustered). Only random or clustered models with self-gravity (which
evolve similarly) are in agreement with observations. Molecular hydrogen forms
in dense filaments and clumps and contributes 20% - 40% to the total mass,
whereas most of the mass (55% - 75%) is in atomic hydrogen. The ionised gas
contributes <10%. For high SN rates (0.5 dex above Kennicutt-Schmidt) as well
as for peak and mixed driving the formation of H$_2$ is strongly suppressed.
Also without self-gravity the H$_2$ fraction is significantly lower ($\sim$
5%). Most of the volume is filled with hot gas ($\sim$90% within $\pm$2 kpc).
Only for random or clustered driving, a vertically expanding warm component of
atomic hydrogen indicates a fountain flow. Magnetic fields have little impact
on the final disc structure. However, they affect dense gas ($n\gtrsim 10\;{\rm

dynamical solutions for cosmic strings with super-critical tensions. To this

  We show numerically that the static deficit angle solution is unstable for

exterior, which has the shape of a growing cigar. We are able to find the

that the exterior conical singularity can be avoided for dynamical solutions.

explore the parameter space by considering different aperture geometries,
contrast levels, dark-zone sizes, bandpasses, and focal plane mask sizes. We
present an application of these solutions to the case of Gemini/GPI with a
design delivering a $10^{-8}$ raw contrast at 0.19 arcsec and offering a
significantly reduced sensitivity to low-order aberrations compared to the
current implementation. Optimal solutions have also been found to reach
$10^{-10}$ contrast in broadband light regardless of the telescope aperture
shape (in particular the central obstruction size), with effective IWA in the

that this represents the detection of an underlying low metallicity stellar

The metallicity and spatial distribution of the stellar halo of NGC~3115 are
consistent with the galaxy's globular cluster system, which has a similar low
metallicity population that becomes dominant at these large radii. This finding
supports the use of globular clusters as bright chemo-dynamical tracers of

methods assume a linear scaling between the (galaxy-averaged) dust-to-gas ratio
D and metallicity Z of the interstellar medium (ISM). Indeed, nearby galaxies
with solar or moderately sub-solar metallicities clearly follow this trend
albeit with significant scatter. However, a growing number of observations show
that the linear scaling breaks down for metal-poor galaxies (Z<0.2 Z_sun),
highlighting the need for a more sophisticated modeling of the dust-to-metal
ratio of galaxies. Here we study the co-evolution of dust and metal abundances
in galaxies with the help of a dynamical, one-zone model that incorporates dust
formation and destruction processes in addition to gas inflows, outflows, and
metal enrichment. The dynamical model is consistent with various observational
constraints, including the stellar mass -- metallicity relation, the stellar
mass -- halo mass relation, and the observed Z -- D relation for both
metal-poor and metal-rich galaxies. The functional form of the Z -- D relation
follows from a basic equilibrium ansatz, similar to the ideas used previously
to model the stellar mass -- metallicity relation. Galactic outflows regulate
the inflow rate of gas from the cosmic web for galaxies of a given star
formation rate. The mass loading factor of outflows thus dictates the rate at
which the dust and metal content of the ISM is diluted. The stellar mass
dependence of the mass loading factor drives the evolution of metallicities,
dust-to-gas ratios, and dust-to-metal ratios in galaxies.

which likely controls the star formation rate (SFR) and the initial mass
function (IMF). Interstellar turbulence is non-universal, with a wide range of
Mach numbers, magnetic fields strengths, and driving mechanisms. Although some
of these parameters were explored, most previous works assumed that the gas is
isothermal. However, we know that cold molecular clouds form out of the warm
atomic medium, with the gas passing through chemical and thermodynamic phases
that are not isothermal. Here we determine the role of temperature variations
by modelling non-isothermal turbulence with a polytropic equation of state
(EOS), where pressure and temperature are functions of gas density,
P~rho^Gamma, T~rho^(Gamma-1). We use grid resolutions of 2048^3 cells and
compare polytropic exponents Gamma=0.7 (soft EOS), Gamma=1 (isothermal EOS),
and Gamma=5/3 (stiff EOS). We find a complex network of non-isothermal
filaments with more small-scale fragmentation occurring for Gamma<1, while
Gamma>1 smoothes out density contrasts. The density probability distribution
function (PDF) is significantly affected by temperature variations, with a
power-law tail developing at low densities for Gamma>1. In contrast, the PDF
becomes closer to a lognormal distribution for Gamma<=1. We derive and test a
new density variance - Mach number relation that takes Gamma into account. This
new relation is relevant for theoretical models of the SFR and IMF, because it
determines the dense gas mass fraction of a cloud, from which stars form. We
derive the SFR as a function of Gamma and find that it decreases by a factor of
~5 from Gamma=0.7 to Gamma=5/3.

orbifold technology. In particular, we describe the group theoretic constraints
on permutation groups to ensure a (stringy) holographic CFT. The primary result
we uncover is that in order for the degeneracy of states to be finite in the
large central charge limit, the groups of interest are the so-called
oligomorphic permutation groups. Further requiring that the low-lying spectrum
be sparse enough puts a bound on the number of orbits of these groups (on
finite element subsets). Along the way we also study familiar cyclic and
symmetric orbifolds to build intuition. We also demonstrate how holographic
spectral properties are tied to the geometry of covering spaces for permutation

correlation in the star formation rate (SFR) versus stellar mass ($M_*$) plane,
usually referred to as the star formation Main Sequence (MS). Here we combine a
set of hydro-dynamical simulations of interacting galactic disks with
state-of-the-art radiative transfer codes to analyze how the evolution of
mergers is reflected upon the properties of the MS. We present
\textsc{Chiburst}, a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) Spectral Energy
Distribution (SED) code that fits the multi-wavelength, broad-band photometry
of galaxies and derives stellar masses, star formation rates, and geometrical
properties of the dust distribution. We apply this tool to the SEDs of
simulated mergers and compare the derived results with the reference output
from the simulations. Our results indicate that changes in the SEDs of mergers
as they approach coalescence and depart from the MS are related to an evolution
of dust geometry in scales larger than a few hundred parsecs. This is reflected
in a correlation between the specific star formation rate (sSFR), and the
compactness parameter $\mathcal{C}$, that parametrizes this geometry and hence
the evolution of dust temperature ($T_{\rm{dust}}$) with time. As mergers
approach coalescence, they depart from the MS and increase their compactness,
which implies that moderate outliers of the MS are consistent with late-type
mergers. By further applying our method to real observations of Luminous
Infrared Galaxies (LIRGs), we show that the merger scenario is unable to
explain these extreme outliers of the MS. Only by significantly increasing the
gas fraction in the simulations are we able to reproduce the SEDs of LIRGs.

the adaptive mesh refinement code ENZO, we resolve the formation and growth of
a DM halo, until its virial temperature reaches $\sim 10^4$K, atomic cooling
turns on, and collapse ensues. We demonstrate that direct collapse proceeds in
two stages, although they are not well separated. The first stage is triggered
by the onset of atomic cooling, and leads to rapidly increasing accretion rate
with radius, from $\dot M\sim 0.1\,M_\odot {\rm yr^{-1}}$ at the halo virial
radius to few $M_\odot \,{\rm yr^{-1}}$, around the scale radius $R_{\rm s}\sim
30$pc of the NFW DM density profile. The second stage of the collapse commences
when the gas density takes precedence over the DM density. This is associated
with the gas decoupling from the DM gravitational potential. The ensuing
collapse approximates that of an isothermal sphere with $\dot M ( r )\sim
$const. We confirm that the gas loses its angular momentum through
non-axisymmetric perturbations and gravitational torques, to overcome the
centrifugal barrier. During the course of the collapse, this angular momentum
transfer process happens on nearly all spatial scales, and the angular momentum
vector of the gas varies with position and time. Collapsing gas also exhibits
supersonic turbulent motions which suppress gas fragmentation, and are
characterized by density PDF consisting of a lognormal part and a high-density
power law tail.

combines the exact linear evolution with the nonlinear structure of the fluid

candidate, SDSS J012032.19-005501.9 at a relatively high redshift of
0.601,which shows a number of unusual properties. It varies significantly on
timescales of years as typical type I AGNs and marginally on timescales of
weeks. The color-magnitude relation and the structure function are also
consistent with that of type I AGNs, which imply that its variability likely
originates from the black hole accretion system .However, no broad emission
line is detected in the SDSS spectrum, and the upper limit of the equivalent
width of the H$\rm \beta$ broad emission line is much less than that of type I
AGNs. These properties suggest that SDSS J012032.19-005501.9 may be an
unobscured quasar without broad emission lines intrinsically, namely an
unobscured type II AGN or ""true"" type II AGN. Furthermore, its continuum
luminosity is at least one order of magnitude fainter than the average value of
thepast century expected from the [OIII] emission line. It indicates that SDSS

explain this intriguing source are also discussed. Future deep observations at

simple generalizations of the cosmological constant. We show here that a simple
phenomenological interaction in the dark sector provides a good explanation for
this deviation, naturally accommodating the Hubble parameter obtained by BOSS,
$H(z=2.34)=222 \pm 7 ~\mathrm{km~s^{-1}~Mpc^{-1}}$. By performing a global fit
of the parameters with the inclusion of this new data set together with the
Planck data for the interacting model, we are able to show that some
interacting models have constraints for $H(2.34)$ and $D_\mathrm{A}(2.34)$ that
are compatible with the ones obtained by the BOSS Collaboration, showing a
better concordance than $\Lambda$CDM. We also show that the interacting models
that have a small positive coupling constant, which helps alleviate the
coincidence problem, are compatible with the cosmological observations. Adding
the likelihood of these new baryon acoustic oscillations data shows an
improvement in the global fit, although it is not statistically significant.
The coupling constant could not be fully constrained by the data sets used, but
the dark energy equation of state shows a slight preference for a value
different from a cosmological constant.

understanding of protein structure, function, dynamics and transport is one of
most challenging tasks in biological science. In the present work, persistent
homology is, for the first time, introduced for extracting molecular
topological fingerprints (MTFs) based on the persistence of molecular
topological invariants. MTFs are utilized for protein characterization,
identification and classification. The method of slicing is proposed to track
the geometric origin of protein topological invariants. Both all-atom and
coarse-grained representations of MTFs are constructed. A new cutoff-like
filtration is proposed to shed light on the optimal cutoff distance in elastic
network models. Based on the correlation between protein compactness, rigidity
and connectivity, we propose an accumulated bar length generated from
persistent topological invariants for the quantitative modeling of protein
flexibility. To this end, a correlation matrix based filtration is developed.
This approach gives rise to an accurate prediction of the optimal
characteristic distance used in protein B-factor analysis. Finally, MTFs are
employed to characterize protein topological evolution during protein folding
and quantitatively predict the protein folding stability. An excellent
consistence between our persistent homology prediction and molecular dynamics
simulation is found. This work reveals the topology-function relationship of
proteins.

the attractive part induces the pairing, resulting in a supersolid with

construction of atomic rigidity functions. The FRI method analyzes protein
rigidity and flexibility and is capable of predicting protein B-factors without
resorting to matrix diagonalization. A fundamental assumption used in the FRI
is that protein structures are uniquely determined by various internal and
external interactions, while the protein functions, such as stability and
flexibility, are solely determined by the structure. As such, one can predict
protein flexibility without resorting to the protein interaction Hamiltonian.
Consequently, bypassing the matrix diagonalization, the original FRI has a
computational complexity of O(N^2). This work introduces a fast FRI (fFRI)
algorithm for the flexibility analysis of large macromolecules. The proposed
fFRI further reduces the computational complexity to O(N). Additionally, we
propose anisotropic FRI (aFRI) algorithms for the analysis of protein
collective dynamics. The aFRI algorithms admit adaptive Hessian matrices, from
a completely global 3N*3N matrix to completely local 3*3 matrices. However,
these local 3*3 matrices have built in much non-local correlation. Furthermore,
we compare the accuracy and efficiency of FRI with some {established}
approaches to flexibility analysis, namely, normal mode analysis (NMA) and
Gaussian network model (GNM). The accuracy of the FRI method is tested. The
FRI, particularly the fFRI, is orders of magnitude more efficient and about 10%
more accurate overall than some of the most popular methods in the field. The
proposed fFRI is able to predict B-factors for alpha-carbons of the HIV virus

be achieved by a small modification of the parameters of the theory. We
illustrate this general result by investigation of models with a single chiral
superfield recently proposed by Ketov and Terada. We show that the addition of
a small constant or a linear term to the superpotential of a model with a
stable supersymmetric Minkowski vacuum converts it to an AdS vacuum, which
results in a rapid cosmological collapse. One can avoid this problem and uplift
a supersymmetric Minkowski vacuum to a dS vacuum with $V_{0}\sim 10^{-120}$
without violating the no-go theorem by making these extra terms large enough.
However, we show that this leads to a strong supersymmetry breaking in the
uplifted vacua.

additional thermal resistance on top of the phonon-phonon thermal resistance,
it can also make the phonon-phonon thermal conductance larger than the pure

phonon subsystem and enhance the energy communication between different phonon
modes inside the metal. This facilitates redistributing phonon energy into
modes that can more easily transfer energy across the interfaces. Compared to
the pure phonon thermal conduction, the total thermal conductance with e-ph

factor. This result helps clarify the role of e-ph coupling in thermal
transport across metal-nonmetal interface.

are unlikely to be due to photospheric emission from the hot central stars

optically-thin thermal plasmas. From the plasma properties, we identify two
classes of CSPN X-ray emission: (1) high-temperature plasmas with X-ray
luminosities, $L_{\rm X}$, that appear uncorrelated with the CSPN bolometric
luminosity, $L_{\rm bol}$; and (2) lower-temperature plasmas with $L_{\rm
X}/L_{\rm bol}\sim10^{-7}$. We suggest these two classes correspond to the
physical processes of magnetically active binary companions and self-shocking
stellar winds, respectively. In many cases this conclusion is supported by
corroborative multiwavelength evidence for the wind and binary properties of
the PN central stars. By thus honing in on the origins of X-ray emission from

systems with stationary additive disturbances. The objective is to find a state
feedback gain that minimizes a quadratic stage cost function, while observing
chance constraints on the input and/or the state. Unlike most of the previous
literature, the chance constraints (and the stage cost) are not considered on
each input/state of the transient response. Instead, they refer to the
input/state of the closed-loop system in its stationary mode of operation.
Hence the control is optimized for a long-run, rather than a finite-horizon
operation. The controller synthesis can be cast as a convex semi-definite
program (SDP). The chance constraints appear as linear matrix inequalities.
Both single chance constraints (SCCs) and joint chance constraints (JCCs) on
the input and/or the state can be included. If the disturbance is Gaussian,
additionally to WSS, this information can be used to improve the controller
design. The presented approach can also be extended to the case of output
feedback. The entire design procedure is flexible and easy to implement, as
demonstrated on a short illustrative example.

realisation of the spatial process, typically leads to inaccurate estimates and
poorly identified parameters. A common way to handle this is to fix some of the
parameters, or within the Bayesian framework, impose prior knowledge. In many
applied settings, stationary models are not flexible enough to model the
process of interest, thus non-stationary spatial models are used. However, more
flexible models usually means more parameters, and the identifiability problem
becomes even more challenging. We investigate aspects of estimation of a
Bayesian non-stationary spatial model for annual precipitation using
observations from multiple years. The model contains replicates of the spatial
field, which increases precision of the estimates and makes them less prior
sensitive. Using R-INLA, we analyse precipitation data from southern Norway,
and investigate statistical properties of the replicate model in a simulation
study. The non-stationary spatial model we explore belongs to a recently
introduced class of stochastic partial differential equation (SPDE) based
spatial models. This model class allows for non-stationary models with
explanatory variables in the dependence structure. We derive conditions to
facilitate prior specification for these types of non-stationary spatial
models.

impact of user pairing on the performance of two NOMA systems, NOMA with fixed
power allocation (F-NOMA) and cognitive radio inspired NOMA (CR-NOMA), is
characterized. For FNOMA, both analytical and numerical results are provided to
demonstrate that F-NOMA can offer a larger sum rate than orthogonal MA, and the
performance gain of F-NOMA over conventional MA can be further enlarged by
selecting users whose channel conditions are more distinctive. For CR-NOMA, the
quality of service (QoS) for users with the poorer channel condition can be
guaranteed since the transmit power allocated to other users is constrained
following the concept of cognitive radio networks. Because of this constraint,
CR-NOMA has different behavior compared to F-NOMA. For example, for the user
with the best channel condition, CR-NOMA prefers to pair it with the user with
the second best channel condition, whereas the user with the worst channel
condition is preferred by F-NOMA.

Generalizations of the Marko-Siggia relation appropriate for polymers in
nanoconfinement are presented. The forms for both strong and weak confinement
regimes are characterized by an \textit{effective dimensionality}. At low
forces, the effective dimensionality is given by the correlations along the
polymer in the plane of the confining walls. At high forces, the theoretical
force must account for reduced conformation space. Together the interpolations
give good agreement for all slit heights at all forces. As DNA and other

recommender systems, data are gathered through clinical studies or targeted
surveys. Participants are generally reluctant to respond to all questions in a
survey or they may lack information to respond adequately to some questions.
The data collected from these studies tend to lead to linear regression models
where the regression vectors are only known partially: some of their entries
are either missing completely or replaced randomly by noisy values. In this
work, assuming missing positions are replaced by noisy values, we examine how a
connected network of agents, with each one of them subjected to a stream of
data with incomplete regression information, can cooperate with each other
through local interactions to estimate the underlying model parameters in the
presence of missing data. We explain how to adjust the distributed diffusion
through (de)regularization in order to eliminate the bias introduced by the
incomplete model. We also propose a technique to recursively estimate the
(de)regularization parameter and examine the performance of the resulting
strategy. We illustrate the results by considering two applications: one
dealing with a mental health survey and the other dealing with a household
consumption survey.

maintain episodic spatial representations, while parallel striatal pathways
contribute to both declarative and procedural value computations by encoding
different input-specific outcome predictions. In this paper we investigate the
use of these brain mechanisms for action selection, linking them to model-based
and model-free controllers for decision making. To this aim we propose a
biologically inspired computational model that embodies these theories and
explains the functioning of the hippocampal-striatal circuit in a rat
navigation task. Its main characteristic is to allow the cooperation of
habitual and goal-directed behaviors, with the hippocampus primarily involved
in encoding spatial information and simulating possible navigation paths, and
the ventral and dorsal striatum involved in learning stimulus-response
behaviors and evaluating the reward expectancies associated to predicted
locations and sensed stimuli, respectively. The architecture we present employs
an unsupervised reinforcement learning rule for the hippocampal-striatal
network that is able to build a representation of the environment in which
rewarding sites and informative landmarks produce value gradients that are used
for planning and decision making. Additionally, it utilizes an arbitration
mechanism that balances between exploitation, i.e. stimulus-response behaviors,
and mental exploration, i.e. motor imagery processes, based on the intensity
and the variability of the responses of striatal neurons. We interpret these
results in light of recent experimental data that show anticipatory activations
in hippocampal and striatal areas.

for studying the pulsar magnetosphere, because they can handle the force-free

reconnection. In the limit of dense plasma throughout the magnetosphere, our
solutions are everywhere in the force-free regime except for dissipative
regions at the polar caps, in the current layers, and at the Y-point. These
dissipative regions arise self-consistently, since we do not have any explicit
dissipation in the code. A minimum of $ \approx 15-20\%$ of the electromagnetic
spindown luminosity is transferred to the particles inside 5 light cylinder
radii. However, the particles can carry as much as $\gtrsim 50 \%$ of the
spindown luminosity if there is insufficient plasma in the outer magnetosphere
to screen the component of electric field parallel to the magnetic field. In
reality, the component of the spindown luminosity carried by the particles
could be radiated as gamma rays, but high-frequency synchrotron emission would
need to be implemented as a sub-grid process in our simulations and is not
present for the current suite of runs. The value of the spindown luminosity in
our simulations is within $\approx 10\%$ of the force-free value, and the
structure of the electromagnetic fields in the magnetosphere is on the whole
consistent with the force-free model.

physical distance between the human and robot: remote and proximal. In proximal
interaction, the human and robot often engage in close coordination; in remote
interaction, the human and robot are less coupled due to communication
constraints. As a result, providing automation for the robot in remote
interaction becomes more important. Thus far, human factor studies on
automation in remote human-robot interaction have been restricted to various
forms of supervision, in which the robot is essentially being used as a smart
mobile manipulation platform with sensing capabilities. In this paper, we
investigate the incorporation of general planning capability into the robot to
facilitate peer-to-peer human-robot teaming, in which the human and robot are
viewed as teammates that are physically separated. The human and robot share
the same global goal and collaborate to achieve it. Note that humans may feel
uncomfortable at such robot autonomy, which can potentially reduce teaming
performance. One important difference between peer-to-peer teaming and
supervised teaming is that an autonomous robot in peer-to-peer teaming can
achieve the goal alone when the task information is completely specified.
However, incompleteness often exists, which implies information asymmetry.
While information asymmetry can be desirable sometimes, it may also lead to the
robot choosing improper actions that negatively influence the teaming
performance. We aim to investigate the various trade-offs, e.g., mental
workload and situation awareness, between these two types of remote human-robot
teaming.

the analysis by scrutinizing the frequencies found in the CoRoT photometric
satellite measurements and ground-based high-resolution spectroscopy of the

frequencies found using the two techniques and no characteristic period
spacings or couplings were identified in either dataset. The spectroscopic data
additionally show no evidence for any long term (5 year) variation in the
dominant frequency. The 31 spectroscopic frequencies identified have standard
deviation profiles suggesting multiple modes sharing (l, m) in the {\delta}
Scuti frequency region and several skewed modes sharing the same (l, m) in the

the {\gamma} Doradus frequency region that appears to be unrelated to the

as a root of the characteristic polynomial, and the latter is the dimension of
the eigenvariety (i.e., the set of eigenvectors) corresponding to the
eigenvalue.
  We show that the algebraic multiplicity could change along the orbit of
tensors by the orthogonal linear group action, while the geometric multiplicity
of the zero eigenvalue is invariant under this action, which is the main
difficulty to study their relationships. However, we show that for a generic

algebraic multiplicity and geometric multiplicity are one. In general, we
suggest for an $m$-th order $n$-dimensional tensor the relationship \[

it is true for serveral cases, especially when the eigenvariety contains a
linear subspace of dimension $\operatorname{gm}(\lambda)$ in coordinate form.

[3, 4, 5] or trusted computing [24] may address this issue in future. But such
devices tend to be a bit expensive and are not abundant in the market.
Meanwhile, for many years, context based authentication involving device

believe that it is quite likely that EMVCo payment token implementations would

obtained in an all-geometric approach. Compared with standard non-adiabatic

for Hamiltonians that can be written as the sum of commuting Pauli operators.
These Hamiltonians, defined on the Hilbert space of $N$-qubits, serve as one of
the most frequently considered candidates for a self-correcting quantum memory.
A spectral gap bound on the Davies generator establishes an upper limit on the
life time of such a quantum memory and can be used to estimate the time until
the system relaxes to thermal equilibrium when brought into contact with a
thermal heat bath. The bound can be shown to behave as $\lambda \geq {\cal
O}(N^{-1}\exp(-2\beta \, \overline{\epsilon}))$, where $\overline{\epsilon}$ is
a generalization of the well known energy barrier for logical operators.
Particularly in the low temperature regime we expect this bound to provide the
correct asymptotic scaling of the gap with the system size up to a factor of
$N^{-1}$. Furthermore, we discuss conditions and provide scenarios where this
factor can be removed and a constant lower bound can be proven

on finite sequences cannot capture all of their past dependencies. Spectral

forward light scattering at visible and near-infrared wavelengths due to
interference of simultaneously excited electric and magnetic dipole resonances.
For a spherical high-index dielectric, the so-called first Kerker's condition
can be realized, at which the backward scattering practically vanishes for some
combination of refractive index and particle size. However, Kerker's condition
for spherical particles is only possible at the tail of the scattering
resonances, when the particle scatters light weakly. Here we demonstrate that
significantly higher forward scattering can be realized if spheroidal particles
are considered instead. For each value of refractive index exists an optimum
shape of the particle, which produces minimum backscattering efficiency
together with maximum forward scattering. This effect is achieved due to the
overlapping of magnetic and electric dipole resonances of the spheroidal
particle at the resonance frequency. It permits the design of very efficient,
low-loss optical nanoantennas.

zero. We investigate the following two problems:
  (A) Fix $q$ and $r$ that are integral over $\mathcal{O}$, describe all pairs
$(m,n)\in\mathbb{N}^2$ such that $\mathcal{O}[q^m]=\mathcal{O}[r^n]$.
  (B) Fix $r$ that is integral over $\mathcal{O}$, describe all $q$ such that
$\mathcal{O}[q]=\mathcal{O}[r]$.
  In this paper, we solve Problem (A), present a solution of Problem (B) by
Evertse and Gy\H{o}ry, and explain their relation to the paper of Bell and
Hare. In the following, $c_1$ and $c_2$ are effectively computable constants
with a very mild dependence on $\mathcal{O}$, $q$, and $r$. For (B), Evertse

about Pisot numbers by Bell and Hare in ibid. For (A), we show that except some

binaries with a DA/DB white dwarf and an M/late-K dwarf companion are analyzed
based on a spectral decomposition/fitting method. White dwarf effective
temperatures, surface gravities and masses together with the secondary star
spectral types are obtained, and the stellar parameters of DA WDs with $T_{\rm

atmosphere. Two independent distance estimates are derived from the
flux-scaling factors between the WDMS SDSS spectra and the white dwarf and
M-dwarf model spectra. It is found that about more than 20 per cent of the
newly found WDMS binaries show a significant discrepancy between the two
distance estimates. This might be caused by the effects of M-dwarf stellar
activity or irradiation of the M dwarf companions by the white dwarf. The
stellar parameter distributions are used to investigate the global properties
of newly found WDMS binaries, the results shown in this work are consistent
with those derived by previous investigators. Some WDMS binaries have been
observed more than one ($2-4$) times by SDSS, it is found that four of them
exhibit not only Hydrogen emission in all observable Balmer series lines in
addition to He I line Balmer lines but also the rapid variation in the radial
velocities of the components in these binaries. This suggests that they should
be the post common envelope binaries (PCEBs) with a short orbital period. These
young PCEBs are very important for limiting the results of common envelope
phase of the binary evolution.

step is independent of the particle collision time and solely determined by the

proposed that works without a priori knowledge about appliances. The proposed
algorithm works autonomously in real time. The number of used appliances and
the corresponding appliance models are learned in operation and are
progressively updated. The proposed algorithm is considering each useful and
suitable detected power state. The algorithm tries to detect power states
corresponding to on/off appliances as well as to multi-state appliances based
on active power measurements in 1s resolution. We evaluated the novel
introduced load disaggregation approach on real world data by testing the

is ignited off-center. Whether the neon-oxygen flame propagates to the center
is critical to determine whether these stars undergo Fe core collapse or
electron capture induced ONeMg core collapse. We present more details of stars
that ignite neon and oxygen burning off-center. The neon flame is established
in a similar manner to the carbon flame of super-AGB stars, albeit with a
narrower flame width. The criteria for establishing a flame are able to be met
if the strict Schwarzschild criterion for convective instability is adopted.
Mixing across the interface of the convective shell disrupts the conditions for
the propagation of the burning front and instead the shell burns as a series of
inward-moving flashes. While this may not directly affect whether the burning
will reach the center (as in super-AGB stars), the core is allowed to contract
between each shell flash. Reduction of the electron fraction in the shell
reduces the Chandrasekhar mass and the center reaches the threshold density for
the URCA process to activate and steer the remaining evolution of the core.
This highlights the importance of a more accurate treatment of mixing in the
stellar interior for yet another important question in stellar astrophysics -
determining the properties of stellar evolution and supernova progenitors at
the boundary between electron capture supernova and iron core-collapse
supernova.

$8.8$ kpc, present at the two resolution levels even though with a slightly
different strength. Classical bar signatures (e.g. pattern of streaming
motions, high $m=2$ Fourier mode with roughly constant phase) are consistently
found at both resolutions. Though a close encounter with a merging satellite at
$z\sim0.6$ (mass ratio $1:50$) causes a strong, transient spiral pattern and
some heating of the disk, we find that bar instability is due to secular

mass in the disk. The AqC galaxy has a slightly different history: it suffers a
similar tidal disturbance due to a merging satellite at $z\sim0.5$ but with a
mass ratio of $1:32$, that triggers a bar in the high-resolution simulation,
while at low resolution the merging is found to take place at a later time, so
that both secular evolution and merging are plausible triggers for bar

interact in ways which are not possible with present-day technology. Their
implementation is a key challenge for quantum science and requires the
development of stationary quantum nodes that can send and receive as well as
store and process quantum information locally. The nodes are connected by
quantum channels for flying information carriers, i.e. photons. These channels
serve both to directly exchange quantum information between nodes as well as to
distribute entanglement over the whole network. In order to scale such networks
to many particles and long distances, an efficient interface between the nodes
and the channels is required. This article describes the cavity-based approach
to this goal, with an emphasis on experimental systems in which single atoms
are trapped in and coupled to optical resonators. Besides being conceptually
appealing, this approach is promising for quantum networks on larger scales, as
it gives access to long qubit coherence times and high light-matter coupling
efficiencies. Thus, it allows one to generate entangled photons on the push of
a button, to reversibly map the quantum state of a photon onto an atom, to
transfer and teleport quantum states between remote atoms, to entangle distant
atoms, to detect optical photons nondestructively, to perform entangling
quantum gates between an atom and one or several photons, and even provides a
route towards efficient heralded quantum memories for future repeaters. The
presented general protocols and the identification of key parameters are
applicable to other experimental systems.

possessing a radiative envelope, like the A-type stars, is still regarded as a
challenge for stellar physics. Those zones are likely to be differentially
rotating, which suggests that strong interactions between differential rotation
and magnetic fields could be at play. We numerically compute the joint
evolution of the magnetic and velocity fields in a 3D spherical shell starting
from an initial profile for the poloidal magnetic field and differential
rotation. The poloidal magnetic field is initially wound-up by the differential
rotation to produce a toroidal field which becomes unstable. In the particular
setup studied here where the differential rotation is dominant, the
magneto-rotational instability is triggered. The growth rate of the instability
depends mainly on the initial rotation rate, while the background state
typically oscillates over a poloidal Alfv\'en time. We thus find that the
axisymmetric magnetic configuration is strongly modified by the instability
only if the ratio between the poloidal Alfv\'en frequency and the rotation rate
is sufficiently small. An enhanced transport of angular momentum is found in
the most unstable cases: the typical time to flatten the rotation profile is
then much faster than the diffusion time scale. We conclude that the
magneto-rotational instability is always favored (over the Tayler instability)
in unstratified spherical shells when an initial poloidal field is sheared by a
sufficiently strong cylindrical differential rotation. A possible application
to the magnetic desert observed among A stars is given. We argue that the
dichotomy between stars exhibiting strong axisymmetric fields (Ap stars) and
those harboring a sub-Gauss magnetism could be linked to the threshold for the
instability.

all alloys with magnitude nearly in proportion to the TC for x < 0.62, while an
enormous disproportion exists between them near xcrit.. The magnetization,
specific heat, electrical resistivity, and Hall effect measurements confirmed
that the FM transition is suppressed continuously at the critical concentration

which, in turn, is inactivated by Rac1. Growing MTs activate Rac1 at the cell
edge, which closes a positive feedback loop. We investigate both tubulin
sequestering and catastrophe promotion as mechanisms for MT growth inhibition
by stathmin. For a homogeneous stathmin concentration in the absence of Rac1,
we find a switch-like regulation of the MT mean length by stathmin. For
constitutively active Rac1 at the cell edge, stathmin is deactivated locally,
which establishes a spatial gradient of active stathmin. In this gradient, we
find a stationary bimodal MT length distributions for both mechanisms of MT
growth inhibition by stathmin. One subpopulation of the bimodal length
distribution can be identified with fast growing and long pioneering MTs in the
region near the cell edge, which have been observed experimentally. The
feedback loop is closed through Rac1 activation by MTs. For tubulin
sequestering by stathmin, this establishes a bistable switch with two stable
states: one stable state corresponds to upregulated MT mean length and bimodal
MT length distributions, i.e., pioneering MTs; the other stable state
corresponds to an interrupted feedback with short MTs. Stochastic effects as
well as external perturbations can trigger switching events. For catastrophe
promoting stathmin we do not find bistability.

  Our tool is the Guth-Katz incidence theorem for lines in $\mathbb{RP}^3$, but
we focus on how the original $2D$ problem is made amenable to it. This
procedure was initiated by Elekes and Sharir, based on symmetry considerations.
However, symmetry considerations can be bypassed or made implicit. The
classical Pl\""ucker-Klein formalism for line geometry enables one to directly
interpret a solution of $(*)$ as intersection of two lines in $\mathbb{RP}^3$.
This allows for a very brief argument extending the Euclidean plane distance
argument to the spherical and hyperbolic distances. We also find instances of
the question $(*)$ without underlying symmetry group.
  The space of lines in the three-space, the Klein quadric $\mathcal K$, is
four-dimensional. We start out with an injective map $\mathfrak F:\,S\times

combinatorial problem in the form $(*)$, which can be solved by applying the

feedback, although stellar feedback is important to produce realistic star
formation rates and agreement with the Schmidt-Kennicutt relation. We study
internal properties of GMCs resolved by $10^4-10^5$ particles. The clouds are

exit the (sound) Hubble radius when the effective equation of state is slightly

perturbations in this cosmology depends on a combination of the sound speed of
cold dark matter, the Hubble rate in the contracting branch at the time of
equality of the energy densities of cold dark matter and radiation, and the
curvature scale that the loop quantum cosmology bounce occurs at. Importantly,
as this scenario predicts a positive running of the scalar index, observations
can potentially differentiate between it and inflationary models. Finally, for
a small sound speed of cold dark matter, this scenario predicts a small

of the general class. The complete set of the pure vacuum solutions is found.
It consists of two classes. The first one contains the solutions with constant
two-dimensional curvature scalar of our specific metrics, and the
representatives are the famous Robertson--Walker metrics. One of them we called
the ""gravitational bubbles"", which is compact and with zero Weyl tensor. Thus,
we obtained the pure vacuum curved space-times (without any material sources,
including the cosmological constant) what is absolutely impossible in General
Relativity. Such a phenomenon makes it easier to create the universe from
""nothing"". The second class consists of the solutions with varying curvature
scalar. We found its representative as the one-parameter family. It appears
that it can be conformally covered by the thee-parameter Mannheim--Kazanas
solution. We also investigated the general structure of the energy-momentum
tensor in the spherical conformal gravity and constructed the vectorial
equation that reveals clearly some features of non-vacuum solutions. Two of
them are explicitly written, namely, the metrics \`a la Vaidya, and the
electrovacuum space-time metrics.

results of the recent deep observations of XMMU 122939.7+075333, the first
black hole discovered in a globular cluster. The source has been detected many
times, typically with L$_X$ > 10$^{39}$ erg s$^{-1}$, but in a 2010 observation
had faded to L$_X$ ~ 10$^{38}$ erg s$^{-1}$. In our 2011 observations, it has
rebrightened to L$_X$ ~ 2x10$^{39}$ erg s$^{-1}$. This significant increase in
luminosity over a a relatively short time period is not consistent with the
idea that the long term flux modulations displayed by XMMU 122939.7+075333 are
caused by the Kozai mechanism alone as had previously been suggested. Instead,
given that the source shows ""spiky"" behaviour in its light curve, it seems
likely that the faintness in 2010 was a result of a short observation that did
not catch any bright epochs. We also find that when the source is brighter than
average, it has an excess of soft ($<$0.7 keV) photons. The spectral analysis
reveals strong, albeit model-dependent, evidence of emission from highly
ionised oxygen (O VIII) when the source is brighter than average.

energy, charge transfer, density of states and hybridization analysis. The
adsorption energy values increased for those geometries in which keeping the Fe
or Pt atom @top-O, the outermost species was moved to cover the surface. In
general the unsupported clusters present higher intracluster energies than the
adsorbed ones being the average difference of 1.5 eV. In this regard there was
a small reduction in the net magnetic moment of the supported clusters due to
an internal and external rearrangement of the spin-up/-down charge.
Furthermore, a complex and subtle charge transfer between different species
takes place having an increasing the Pt and O population at the expense of the
lost Fe charge.

from the classical continuous media. Here we study pattern formation in a new
framework, namely multiplex networks. These are systems where activator and
inhibitor species occupy separate nodes in different layers. Species react
across layers but diffuse only within their own layer of distinct network
topology. This multiplicity generates heterogeneous patterns with significant
differences from those observed in single-layer networks. Remarkably,
diffusion-induced instability can occur even if the two species have the same
mobility rates; condition which can never destabilize single-layer networks.
The instability condition is revealed using perturbation theory and expressed
by a combination of degrees in the different layers. Our theory demonstrates
that the existence of such topology-driven instabilities is generic in
multiplex networks, providing a new mechanism of pattern formation.

Though this cycle would be shorter and weaker than the average solar cycle, it
would shift the magnetic parity of the solar magnetic field of the earlier
cycles. This extra cycle is sometimes referred to as the 'lost solar cycle' or
'cycle 4b'. Here we reanalyse Be10 measurements with annual resolution from the
NGRIP ice core in Greenland in order to investigate if the hypothesis regarding
a lost sunspot cycle is supported by these measurements. Specifically, we make
use of the fact that the Galactic cosmic rays, responsible for forming Be10 in
the Earth's atmosphere, are affected differently by the open solar magnetic
field during even and odd solar cycles. This fact enables us to evaluate if the
numbering of cycles earlier than cycle 5 is correct. For the evaluation, we use
Bayesian analysis, which reveals that the lost sunspot cycle hypothesis is
likely to be correct. We also discuss if this cycle 4b is a real cycle, or a
phase catastrophe, and what implications this has for our understanding of
stellar activity cycles in general.

Galactic interstellar medium. The combination of these physical models
accurately fit the COS spectrum. Three intrinsic absorbers outflowing with
velocities ~500 km/s are identified, two of which are found directly from two
velocity components of the N V and C IV doublets, while the third is required
by the extra absorption in the Lyman alpha. Their outflow velocities,
ionization states and column densities are consistent with the lowest and
moderately ionization warm absorbers (WAs) in the X-ray domain found by Chandra
observations, suggesting an one-to-one correspondence between the absorbing gas
in the UV and X-ray bands. The small turbulent velocities of the WAs
(v_turb~<100 km/s) support our previous argument from the X-ray study that the
absorbers originate from the inner side of the torus due to thermal
evaporation. Given the covering fractions of ~65% for the three WAs, we deduce
that the lengths and the thicknesses of the WAs are comparable, which indicates
that the geometry of WAs are more likely clouds rather than flat and thin
layers. In addition, the modeling of the broad line emission suggests a higher
covering fraction of clouds when they are very closer to the black hole.

substantially contributing to the VHE emission from these regions. Here, we use
three tracers for the commonly explored components: intensity of the

hyperfine transition at 21cm to trace atomic hydrogen, and dust emission to
trace the total hydrogen content. We show that the estimates of material

communications. Eliminating additional communications also reduces the hardware
complexity. In order to show the validity of the proposed design in real

Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA). Since the implementation of a
Network-on-Chip (NoC) requires certain amount of area on the chip, the
suggested approach is also able to reduce the demand of hardware resources. In
this method, the internal memory of the FPGA is used for implementing control

alternative to existing techniques typically applied to this class of problems,

moments of the average level density for systems with $m$ bosons or fermions
that interact through a random $k$-body Hermitian potential ($k \le m$); the
ensemble of such potentials with a Gaussian weight is known as the embedded
Gaussian Unitary Ensemble (eGUE) [2]. Our results apply in the limit where the
number $l$ of available single-particle states is taken to infinity. A key
advantage of the method is that it provides an efficient way to identify only
those expressions which will stay relevant in this limit. It also provides a
general argument for why these terms have to be the same for bosons and
fermions. The moments are obtained as sums over ratios of binomial expressions,
with a transition from moments associated to a semi-circular level density for
$m < 2k$ to Gaussian moments in the dilute limit $k \ll m \ll l$. Regarding the
form of this transition, we see that as $m$ is increased, more and more
diagrams become relevant, with new contributions starting from each of the

the acceleration between humans who interact through the exchange of messages,

have complete information about all interactions (exchange events) between
about 1/2 million players, and about their trajectories (positions) in a metric
space of the game universe at any point in time. We derive the interaction
potentials for communication, trade and attacks and show that they are harmonic
in nature. Individuals who exchange messages and trade goods generally attract
each other and start to separate immediately after exchange events stop. The
interaction potential for attacks mirrors the usual ""hit-and-run"" tactics of
aggressive players. By measuring interaction intensities as a function of
distance, velocity and acceleration, we show that ""forces"" between players are
directly related to the number of exchange events. The power-law of the
likelihood for interactions vs. distance is in accordance with previous real

new extended standards emerge or ontologies are used to define mappings between
concrete data models. Within the COOPERaTE project a neighbourhood information

various kinds of data to be stored and exchanged. The implementation of the NIM

Defining components in general-purpose programming languages restricts their

composition with implementation details. The vision of model-driven engineering
is to reduce the gap between developer intention and implementation details by
lifting abstract models to primary development artifacts and systematically
transforming these into executable systems. For sufficiently complex systems
the transformation from abstract models to platform-specific implementations
requires augmentation with platform-specific components. We propose a

provides an initial energy estimate of $\approx$2.8$\times$10$^{31}$ ergs to

reconstruction (SPIDER) is introduced and experimentally demonstrated. Other
than most previously demonstrated variants of SPIDER, our method is based on a
third-order nonlinear optical effect, namely self-diffraction, rather than the
second-order effect of sum-frequency generation. On one hand, self-diffraction
(SD) substantially simplifies phase-matching capabilities for multi-octave
spectra that cannot be hosted by second-order processes, given manufacturing
limitations of crystal lengths in the few-micrometer range. On the other hand,
however, SD SPIDER imposes an additional constraint as it effectively measures
the spectral phase of a self-convolved spectrum rather than immediately
measuring the fundamental phase. Reconstruction of the latter from the measured
phase and the spectral amplitude of the fundamental turns out to be an
ill-posed problem, which we address by a regularization approach. We discuss
the numerical implementation in detail and apply it to measured data from a
Ti:sapphire amplifier system. Our experimental demonstration used 40-fs pulses
and a 500 $\mu$m thick BaF${}_2$ crystal to show that the SD SPIDER signal is
sufficiently strong to be separable from stray light. Extrapolating these
measurements to the thinnest conceivable nonlinear media, we predict that
bandwidths well above two optical octaves can be measured by a suitably adapted
SD SPIDER apparatus, enabling the direct characterization of pulses down to
single-femtosecond pulse durations. Such characteristics appear out of range
for any currently established pulse measurement technique.

this work we develop a model that describes how the force on the
adhesin-receptor interaction of a type 1 fimbriae varies as a bacterium is
affected by a time dependent fluid flow mimicking in vivo conditions. The model
combines in vivo hydrodynamic conditions with previously assessed biomechanical
properties of the fimbriae. Numerical methods are used to solve for the motion
and adhesion force under the presence of time dependent fluid profiles. It is
found that a bacterium tethered with a type 1 pilus will experience
significantly reduced shear stress for moderate to high flow velocities and
that the maximum stress the adhesin will experience is limited to ~120 pN,
which is sufficient to activate the conformational change of the FimH adhesin
into its stronger state but also lower than the force required for breaking it
under rapid loading. Our model thus supports the assumption that the type 1
fimbriae shaft and the FimH adhesin-receptor interaction are optimized to each

are measured. Assuming that these abundances come from matter that has been
processed in the SN and then captured by the secondary star, we explore
different SN explosion scenarios with diverse geometries. A non-spherically
symmetric SN explosion, with a low mass cut, seems to reproduce better the
observed abundance pattern of the secondary star compared to the spherical
case.

density, and eccentricity of this exoplanet. In order to test the hypothesis of

staring mode during 5.4 continuous hours, with the telescope defocused,
monitoring the target during the expected secondary eclipse. A relative light
curve was generated and corrected from systematic effects, using the Principal
Component Analysis (PCA) technique. The final light curve was fitted using a
transit model to find the eclipse depth and a possible phase shift. The best
model obtained from the Markov Chain Monte Carlo analysis resulted in an
eclipse depth of $\Delta F$ of $0.137\%^{+0.013\%}_{-0.019\%}$ and a phase
offset of $\Delta \phi $ of $-0.0028^{+0.0005}_{-0.0004}$. The eclipse phase
offset derived from our modeling has systematic errors that were not taken into

communication technology. High fidelity V2V communication is, in turn,
dependent on accurate V2V channel estimation. V2V channels have characteristics
differing from classical cellular communication channels. Herein,
geometry-based stochastic modeling is employed to develop a characterization of
V2V channel channels. The resultant model exhibits significant structure;
specifically, the V2V channel is characterized by three distinct regions within
the delay-Doppler plane. Each region has a unique combination of specular
reflections and diffuse components resulting in a particular element-wise and
group-wise sparsity. This joint sparsity structure is exploited to develop a
novel channel estimation algorithm. A general machinery is provided to solve
the jointly element/group sparse channel (signal) estimation problem using
proximity operators of a broad class of regularizers. The alternating direction
method of multipliers using the proximity operator is adapted to optimize the
mixed objective function. Key properties of the proposed objective functions
are proven which ensure that the optimal solution is found by the new
algorithm. The effects of pulse shape leakage are explicitly characterized and
compensated, resulting in measurably improved performance. Numerical simulation
and real V2V channel measurement data are used to evaluate the performance of
the proposed method. Results show that the new method can achieve significant

all rely on some discrimination principle, whether it is statistical
independence or morphological diversity, to distinguish between the sources.
However, dealing with real-world data reveals that such assumptions are rarely
valid in practice: the signals of interest are more likely partially
correlated, which generally hampers the performances of standard BSS methods.
In this article, we introduce a novel sparsity-enforcing BSS method coined
Adaptive Morphological Component Analysis (AMCA), which is designed to retrieve
sparse and partially correlated sources. More precisely, it makes profit of an
adaptive re-weighting scheme to favor/penalize samples based on their level of
correlation. Extensive numerical experiments have been carried out which show
that the proposed method is robust to the partial correlation of sources while
standard BSS techniques fail. The AMCA algorithm is evaluated in the field of
astrophysics for the separation of physical components from microwave data.

fixation prediction models, have traditionally been dealing with locating and
segmenting the most salient object or region in a scene. While the notion of
most salient object is sensible when multiple objects exist in a scene, current
datasets for evaluation of saliency detection approaches often have scenes with
only one single object. We introduce three main contributions in this paper:
First, we take an indepth look at the problem of salient object detection by
studying the relationship between where people look in scenes and what they
choose as the most salient object when they are explicitly asked. Based on the
agreement between fixations and saliency judgments, we then suggest that the
most salient object is the one that attracts the highest fraction of fixations.
Second, we provide two new less biased benchmark datasets containing scenes
with multiple objects that challenge existing saliency models. Indeed, we
observed a severe drop in performance of 8 state-of-the-art models on our
datasets (40% to 70%). Third, we propose a very simple yet powerful model based
on superpixels to be used as a baseline for model evaluation and comparison.
While on par with the best models on MSRA-5K dataset, our model wins over other
models on our data highlighting a serious drawback of existing models, which is
convoluting the processes of locating the most salient object and its
segmentation. We also provide a review and statistical analysis of some labeled
scene datasets that can be used for evaluating salient object detection models.
We believe that our work can greatly help remedy the over-fitting of models to
existing biased datasets and opens new venues for future research in this
fast-evolving field.

almost all of the contribution from the tail part (i.e., $t\to\infty$) of the

  We realize that when $t$ goes to infinity and $0\leqslant b<1,c\in\R$, $\cosh

Since this procedure also captures almost all of the contribution from the head
part (i.e., near $t=0$) of the kernel $\Phi(t)$, we are able to anchor both
ends of the kernel $\Phi(t)$.

democratization of high outflow, has made henceforth E-learning possible for
learners being in virtual classes and geographically distributed. The quality
and quantity of asynchronous and synchronous communications are the key
elements for E-learning success. It is important to have a propitious
supervision to reduce the feeling of isolation in E-learning. This feeling of
isolation is among the main causes of loss and high rates of stalling in
E-learning. The researches to be conducted in this domain aim to bring
solutions of convergence coming from real time image for the capture and
recognition of hand gestures. These gestures will be analyzed by the system and
transformed as indicator of participation. This latter is displayed in the
table of performance of the tutor as a curve according to the time. In case of
isolation of learner, the indicator of participation will become red and the
tutor will be informed of learners with difficulties to participate during
learning session.

are mutually in a constant symmetrical accelerated motion. The maximal
acceleration limit follows from the kinematical origin and it is an analogue of
the maximal velocity in special relativity. We derive the dependence of mass,
length, time, Doppler effect, Cherenkov effect and transition radiation angle
on acceleration as an analogue phenomena in special theory of relativity. The
last application of our method is the Thomas precession by uniform acceleration
with the possible role in the modern physics and cosmology. The comparison of
derived results with other relativistic methods is necessary.
