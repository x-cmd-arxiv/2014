  A graph $G$ is 2-factor hamiltonian if all 2-factors of $G$ are hamiltonian

single flux state can be exploited to construct the so-called backbone as a
reduced version of metabolism. The backbone maintains all significant fluxes
producing or consuming metabolites while displaying a substantially decreased
number of interconnections and, hence, it becomes a useful tool to extract
primary metabolic routes. Here, we disclose the metabolic backbone of
Escherichia coli using the computationally predicted fluxes which maximize the
growth rate in glucose minimal medium, and we compare it with the backbone of
Mycoplasma pneumoniae, a much simpler organism. We find that the central core
in both backbones is mainly composed of reactions in ancient pathways, still
playing at present a key role in energy metabolism. In E. coli, the analysis of
the backbone reveals that the synthesis of nucleotides and the metabolism of
lipids form smaller cores which rely critically on energy metabolism; but not
conversely. At the same time, an analysis of the dependence of this backbone on
media composition leads to the identification of pathways sensitive to
environmental changes. The metabolic backbone of an organism is thus useful to
trace simultaneously both its evolution and adaptation fingerprints.

for estimating tail distributions in a fast and efficient way. In particular,
they can be used for computing the so-called reactive trajectories
corresponding to direct transitions from one metastable state to another. The
algorithm is based on successive selection-mutation steps performed on the
system in a controlled way. It has two intrinsic parameters, the number of
particles/trajectories and the reaction coordinate used for discriminating good
or bad trajectories. We investigate first the convergence in law of the
algorithm as a function of the timestep for several simple stochastic models.
Second, we consider the average duration of reactive trajectories for which no
theoretical predictions exist. The most important aspect of this work concerns
some systems with two degrees of freedom. They are studied in details as a
function of the reaction coordinate in the asymptotic regime where the number
of trajectories goes to infinity. We show that during phase transitions, the
statistics of the algorithm deviate significatively from known theoretical
results when using non-optimal reaction coordinates. In this case, the variance
of the algorithm is peaking at the transition and the convergence of the
algorithm can be much slower than the usual expected central limit behavior.
The duration of trajectories is affected as well. Moreover, reactive
trajectories do not correspond to the most probable ones. Such behavior
disappears when using the optimal reaction coordinate called committor as
predicted by the theory. We finally investigate a three-state Markov chain
which reproduces this phenomenon and show logarithmic convergence of the
trajectory durations.

primary fragments, its galaxy memberships (relative to the virial sphere of the

masses are much less biased and usually with less scatter, as are its group
luminosities and stellar masses (computed in MAGGIE using the membership

for the reliability of the galaxy population and the dispersion of its total

is some $\pi$-rotation in the spin internal space and $T$ is time-reversal. One
of these phases is equivalent to the usual spin-1 Haldane phase, while the
other three are different but also typical of spin-1 systems. The model also
exhibits an $SO(5)$-Haldane phase. Moreover, we also find that the transitions
between the different effective spin-1 SPT phases are continuous, and can be
described by a $c=2$ conformal field theory. At such transitions, indirect
evidence suggests a possible effective field theory of four massless Majorana

terms are assumed to satisfy the Beddington-DeAngelis functional responses. We
consider the situation that first species disperse by a combination of random
walk and directed movement along the population density of the second species
which disperse randomly within the habitat. For multi-dimensional bounded
domains, we prove the global existence and boundedness of time-dependent
solutions. For one-dimensional finite domains, we study the effect of diffusion
and advection on the existence and stability of nonconstant positive steady
states to the strongly coupled elliptic system. In particular, our stability
result of these nontrivial steady states provides a selection mechanism for
stable wavemodes of the time-dependent system. In the limit of diffusion rates,
we show that the steady states of this full elliptic system can be approximated
by nonconstant positive solutions of a shadow system and then we construct
boundary spike solutions to this shadow system. For the full elliptic system,
we also investigate solutions with a single boundary spike or an inverted
boundary spike, i.e., the first species concentrate on the boundary point while
the second species dominate the whole habitat except the boundary point. These
spatial structures can be used to model the spatial segregation phenomenon

computing devices with a uniformity condition on the entire family. Examples of
such models include Boolean circuits, membrane systems, DNA computers, chemical
reaction networks and tile assembly systems, and there are many others.
However, in such models there are actually two distinct kinds of uniformity
condition. The first is the most common and well-understood, where each input
length is mapped to a single computing device (e.g. a Boolean circuit) that
computes on the finite set of inputs of that length. The second, called
semi-uniformity, is where each input is mapped to a computing device for that
input (e.g. a circuit with the input encoded as constants). The former notion
is well-known and used in Boolean circuit complexity, while the latter notion
is frequently found in literature on nature-inspired computation from the past
20 years or so.
  Are these two notions distinct? For many models it has been found that these
notions are in fact the same, in the sense that the choice of uniformity or
semi-uniformity leads to characterisations of the same complexity classes. In
other related work, we showed that these notions are actually distinct for
certain classes of Boolean circuits. Here, we give analogous results for
membrane systems by showing that certain classes of uniform membrane systems
are strictly weaker than the analogous semi-uniform classes. This solves a
known open problem in the theory of membrane systems. We then go on to present
results towards characterising the power of these semi-uniform and uniform
membrane models in terms of NL and languages reducible to the unary languages

suppressed by correlations, in particular by the Hund coupling and by the onset
of magnetic order. They also confirm that the half-filled Mn $t_{2g}$ orbitals
give rise to the antiferromagnetic Mott phase. This magnetic ordering leads to
changes in the ionic polar displacement and in turn to the electronic
polarization. In addition, for a fixed ionic displacement, we find that there
is a reduction in the electronic contribution due to partial magnetic
polarization of the Mn e$_g$ orbitals. The reduction of the polarization due to

that can result in rapid atmospheric escape. The composition and structure of
the upper atmospheres of these planets are affected by the high-energy spectrum
of the host star. This emission depends on stellar type and age, which are thus
important factors in understanding the behaviour of exoplanetary atmospheres.
In this study, we focus on Extrasolar Giant Planets (EPGs) orbiting K and M
dwarf stars. XUV spectra for three different stars - epsilon Eridani, AD Leonis
and AU Microscopii - are constructed using a coronal model. Neutral density and
temperature profiles in the upper atmosphere of hypothetical EGPs orbiting
these stars are then obtained from a fluid model, incorporating atmospheric
chemistry and taking atmospheric escape into account. We find that a simple
scaling based solely on the host star's X-ray emission gives large errors in
mass loss rates from planetary atmospheres and so we have derived a new method
to scale the EUV regions of the solar spectrum based upon stellar X-ray
emission. This new method produces an outcome in terms of the planet's neutral
upper atmosphere very similar to that obtained using a detailed coronal model
of the host star. Our results indicate that in planets subjected to radiation
from active stars, the transition from Jeans escape to a regime of hydrodynamic
escape at the top of the atmosphere occurs at larger orbital distances than for
planets around low activity stars (such as the Sun).

induced by non-stoichiometric variations. As a practical example, we discuss
the scheme that establishes such variations in tetragonal Mn3Ga Heusler
material. We justify this approach using first-principles calculations of the
spin-projected conductivity components based on the Kubo-Greenwood formalism.
It follows that, in majority of the cases, even a small substitution of some
other transition element instead of Mn may lead to a substantial increase in
spin-polarization along the tetragonal axis.

variables is known while the directionality and dynamics of input excitation is
often uncertain. Thus, the goal of the mathematical problem that we formulate
is to identify the dynamics and directionality of input excitation in order to
explain and complete observed sample statistics. More specifically, we seek to
explain correlation data with the least number of possible input disturbance
channels. We formulate this inverse problem as rank minimization, and for its
solution, we employ a convex relaxation based on the nuclear norm. The
resulting optimization problem is cast as a semidefinite program and can be
solved using general-purpose solvers. For problem sizes that these solvers
cannot handle, we develop a customized alternating minimization algorithm
(AMA). We interpret AMA as a proximal gradient for the dual problem and prove
sub-linear convergence for the algorithm with fixed step-size. We conclude with
an example that illustrates the utility of our modeling and optimization

galaxy NGC 7507 do not necessarily require dark matter. This is troubling
because, in the context of LCDM cosmologies, all galaxies should have a large
dark matter component. We use penalised pixel fitting software to extract
velocities and velocity dispersions from GMOS slit mask spectra. Using Jeans
and MONDian modelling we produce best fit models to the velocity dispersion. We
find that NGC 7507 has a two component stellar halo, with the outer halo and
inner haloes counter rotating. The velocity dispersion profile exhibits an
increase at ~70"" (~7.9 kpc), reminiscent of several other elliptical galaxies.
Our best fit models are those under mild anisotropy which include ~100 times
less dark matter than predicted by LCDM, although mildly anisotropic models
that are completely dark matter free fit almost equally well. Our MONDian
models, both isotropic and anisotropic, systematically fail to reproduce the
measured velocity dispersions at almost all radii. The counter rotating outer
halo implies a merger remnant, as does the increase in velocity dispersion at
~70"". From simulations it seems plausible that the merger that caused the
increase in velocity dispersion was a spiral-spiral merger. Our Jeans models
are completely consistent with a no dark matter scenario, however, some dark
matter can be accommodated, although at much lower concentrations that
predicted by LCDM simulations. This indicates that NGC 7507 may be a dark
matter free elliptical galaxy. Whether NGC 7507 is completely dark matter free
or very dark matter poor, this is at odds with predictions from current LCDM
cosmological simulations. It may be possible that the observed velocity
dispersions could be reproduced if the galaxy is significantly flattened along
the line of sight (e.g. due to rotation), however, invoking this flattening is
problematic.

combining exponential growth and small-world properties with finite spectral

causes bumps to wander about the domain in a purely diffusive way. Utilizing a
small noise expansion along with a solvability condition, we can derive an
effective stochastic equation describing the bump dynamics as two-dimensional
Brownian motion. The diffusion coefficient can then be computed explicitly. We
also show that weak external inputs can pin the bump so it no longer wanders
diffusively. Inputs reshape the effective potential that guides the dynamics of
the bump position, so it tends to lie near attractors which can be single
points or contours in the plane. Perturbative analysis shows the bump position

regression. This is by contrast with earlier approaches, where selection
functions were manually-designed for each problem setting. We show that our

is that they are density waves launched by one or more embedded (proto-)planets
in the disc. In this paper we investigate whether planets can be held
responsible for the excitation mechanism of the observed spirals. We use
locally isothermal hydrodynamic simulations as well as analytic formulae to
model the spiral waves launched by planets. Then H-band scattered light images
are calculated using a 3D continuum radiative transfer code to study the effect
of surface density and pressure scale height perturbation on the detectability
of the spirals. We find that a relative change of about 3.5 in the surface
density is required for the spirals to be detected with current telescopes in
the near-infrared for sources at the distance of typical star-forming regions
(140pc). This value is a factor of eight higher than what is seen in
hydrodynamic simulations. We also find that a relative change of only 0.2 in
pressure scale height is sufficient to create detectable signatures under the
same conditions. Therefore, we suggest that the spiral arms observed to date in
protoplanetary discs are the results of changes in the vertical structure of
the disc (e.g. pressure scale height perturbation) instead of surface density
perturbations.

  Facility Location",,,,,"cs.GT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We consider a strategic variant of the facility location problem. We would
like to locate a facility on a closed interval. There are n agents located on
that interval, divided into two types: type 1 agents, who wish for the facility
to be as far from them as possible, and type 2 agents, who wish for the
facility to be as close to them as possible. Our goal is to maximize a form of
aggregated social benefit: maxisum- the sum of the agents' utilities, or the
egalitarian objective- the minimal agent utility. The strategic aspect of the
problem is that the agents' locations are not known to us, but rather reported
to us by the agents- an agent might misreport his location in an attempt to
move the facility away from or towards to his true location. We therefore
require the facility-locating mechanism to be strategyproof, namely that
reporting truthfully is a dominant strategy for each agent. As simply
maximizing the social benefit is generally not strategyproof, our goal is to
design strategyproof mechanisms with good approximation ratios.
  For the maxisum objective, in the deterministic setting, we provide a
best-possible 3- approximate strategyproof mechanism; in the randomized
setting, we provide a 23/13- approximate strategyproof mechanism and a lower
bound of \frac{2}{\sqrt{3}}. For the egalitarian objective, we provide a lower
bound of 3/2 in the randomized setting, and show that no bounded approximation
ratio is attainable in the deterministic setting. To obtain our deterministic
lower bounds, we characterize all deterministic strategyproof mechanisms when
all agents are of type 1. Finally, we consider a generalized model that allows
an agent to control more than one location, and provide best-possible 3- and
3/2- approximate strategyproof mechanisms for maxisum, in the deterministic and
randomized settings respectively, when only type 1 agents are present.

Accordingly, the spacetime variation of fundamental constants has been an
active subject of research for decades. Recently, using data obtained with
large telescopes a phenomenological model in which the fine structure constant
might vary spatially has been proposed. We test whether this hypothetical
spatial variation of {\alpha}, which follows a dipole law, is compatible with
the data of distant thermonuclear supernovae. Unlike previous works, in our
calculations we consider not only the variation of the luminosity distance when
a varying {\alpha} is adopted, but we also take into account the variation of
the peak luminosity of Type Ia supernovae resulting from a variation of
{\alpha}. This is done using an empirical relation for the peak bolometric
magnitude of thermonuclear supernovae that correctly reproduces the results of
detailed numerical simulations. We find that there is no significant difference
between the several phenomenological models studied here and the standard one,
in which {\alpha} does not vary spatially. We conclude that the present set of
data of Type Ia supernovae is not able to distinguish the standard model from
the dipole models, and thus cannot be used to discard nor to confirm the
proposed spatial variation of {\alpha}.

Ghosh, Tourville and Hirsch (2005), and Heckemann, Hajnal, Aljabar, Rueckert

image segmentation techniques in biomedical applications. By manipulating and
utilizing the entire dataset of ""atlases"" (training images that have been
previously labeled, e.g., manually by an expert), rather than some model-based
average representation, MAS has the flexibility to better capture anatomical
variation, thus offering superior segmentation accuracy. This benefit, however,
typically comes at a high computational cost. Recent advancements in computer
hardware and image processing software have been instrumental in addressing
this challenge and facilitated the wide adoption of MAS. Today, MAS has come a
long way and the approach includes a wide array of sophisticated algorithms
that employ ideas from machine learning, probabilistic modeling, optimization,
and computer vision, among other fields. This paper presents a survey of
published MAS algorithms and studies that have applied these methods to various
biomedical problems. In writing this survey, we have three distinct aims. Our
primary goal is to document how MAS was originally conceived, later evolved,
and now relates to alternative methods. Second, this paper is intended to be a
detailed reference of past research activity in MAS, which now spans over a
decade (2003 - 2014) and entails novel methodological developments and
application-specific solutions. Finally, our goal is to also present a
perspective on the future of MAS, which, we believe, will be one of the

condensates of axions forming compact objects. Without substantial
modifications, the method can only be applied to axions with decay constant,
$f_a$, satisfying $\delta=(f_a\,/\,M_P)^2\ll 1$, where $M_P$ is the Planck
mass. Similarly, the applicability of the Ruffini-Bonazzola method to axion
stars also requires that the relative binding energy of axions satisfies
$\Delta=\sqrt{1-(E_a\,/\,m_a)^2}\ll1$, where $E_a$ and $m_a$ are the energy and
mass of the axion. The simultaneous expansion of the equations of motion in
$\delta$ and $\Delta$ leads to a simplified set of equations, depending only on
the parameter, $\lambda=\sqrt{\delta}\,/\,\Delta$ in leading order of the
expansions. Keeping leading order in $\Delta$ is equivalent to the infrared
limit, in which only relevant and marginal terms contribute to the equations of
motion. The number of axions in the star is uniquely determined by $\lambda$.
Numerical solutions are found in a wide range of $\lambda$. At small $\lambda$
the mass and radius of the axion star rise linearly with $\lambda$. While at
larger $\lambda$ the radius of the star continues to rise, the mass of the
star, $M$, attains a maximum at $\lambda_{\rm max}\simeq 0.58$. All stars are
unstable for $\lambda>\lambda_{\rm max}$ . We discuss the relationship of our
results to current observational constraints on dark matter and the

Our contribution is a specific construction for this case by introducing a
class of frameworks generalizing that of Gr\""{u}nbaum polygons. The
construction applies also to nongeneric configurations, although in this case
the number of edges is not necessarily the minimum. One straightforward
application is the design of wireless sensor networks or multi-agent systems
with the minimum number of communication links.

rely on numerical solvers to handle the subproblems and some render good
performance only at high signal-to-noise ratios. Exploiting the convexity of
the trust-region subproblem for the convex case, our multi-block BCA
significantly reduces the complexity and enhances the previous results by
providing an analytical expression for the energy-preserving optimal solution.

free TDGs may constitute a significant component of the dwarf galaxy (DG)
population. But it remains to be demonstrated that TDGs can survive their
formation phase given stellar feedback processes, the time-variable tidal field
of the post-encounter host galaxy and its dark matter halo and ram-pressure
wind from the gaseous halo of the host. For robust results the maximally
damaging feedback by a fully populated invariant stellar IMF in each star
cluster is assumed, such that fractions of massive stars contribute during
phases of low star-formation rates. The model galaxies are studied in terms of
their star-formation history, chemical enrichment and rotational curves. All
models evolve into a self-regulated long-term equilibrium star-formation phase
lasting for the full simulation time, whereby the TDGs become significantly
more compact and sustain significantly higher SFRs through compressive tides

extreme feedback, and none of the rotation curves achieves the high values

which can be realized as nonlinear sigma models into Calabi-Yau d-folds, this
flat connection is equivalent to special geometry for threefolds and to its
analogs in other dimensions. We show that the non-holomorphic content of the
$tt^*$ equations in the cases $d=1,2,3$ is captured in terms of finitely many
generators of special functions, which close under derivatives. The generators
are understood as coordinates on a larger moduli space. This space
parameterizes a freedom in choosing representatives of the chiral ring while
preserving a constant topological metric. Geometrically, the freedom
corresponds to a choice of forms on the target space respecting the Hodge
filtration and having a constant pairing. Linear combinations of vector fields
on that space are identified with generators of a Lie algebra. This Lie algebra
replaces the non-holomorphic derivatives of $tt^*$ and provides these with a
finer and algebraic meaning. For sigma models into lattice polarized $K3$
manifolds, the differential ring of special functions on the moduli space is
constructed, extending known structures for $d=1$ and 3. The generators of the
differential rings of special functions are given by quasi-modular forms for
$d=1$ and their generalizations in $d=2,3$. Some explicit examples are worked
out including the case of the mirror of the quartic in $CP^3$, where due to
further algebraic constraints, the differential ring coincides with quasi

different family of galaxies, we also include 6 well sampled near IR-selected
BzK galaxies at z~1.5. From our analysis based on the radiative transfer
spectral synthesis code GRASIL, we find that, while the IR luminosity may be a
biased tracer of the star formation rate (SFR) depending on the age of stars
dominating the dust heating, the inclusion of the radio flux offers
significantly tighter constraints on SFR. Our predicted SFRs are in good
agreement with the estimates based on rest-frame radio luminosity and the Bell
(2003) calibration. The extensive spectro-photometric coverage of our sample
allows us to set important constraints on the SF history of individual objects.
For essentially all galaxies we find evidence for a rather continuous SFR and a
peak epoch of SF preceding that of the observation by a few Gyrs. This seems to
correspond to a formation redshift of z~5-6. We finally show that our physical
analysis may affect the interpretation of the SFR-M* diagram, by possibly
shifting, with respect to previous works, the position of the most dust
obscured objects to higher M* and lower SFRs.

of resolved logarithmical oscillations in the bispectrum is limited due to the
discrete resolution of the multipole bispectrum. We derive a simple relation
between the maximum number of resolved oscillations and the frequency. We
investigate several ways to factorize the primordial bispectrum, and conclude
that a one dimensional expansion in the sum of the momenta $\sum k_i = k_t$ is
the most efficient and flexible approach. We compare the expansion to the exact

$\mathcal{O}(10^3)$ modes are sufficient for an accurate reconstruction. We

fermion signs, the hopping hole picks up subtle phases pending the fluctuating

modulations in the density matrix renormalization group solutions which
disappear when the phase strings are switched off. This form of charge
modulation can be understood analytically in a path-integral language, showing
that the phase strings give rise to constructive interferences leading to
self-localization. When the latter occurs, left- and right-moving propagating

responsible for the real space charge modulation.

observations to infer cosmological parameters, but it is naturally also
possible to take the cosmological parameters as given and use time delays as
constraints on the mass distribution. This paper develops a method to isolate
what exactly those constraints are, using a principal-components analysis of
ensembles of free-form mass models. We find that time delays provide tighter
constraints on the distribution of matter in the very high dense regions of the
lensing clusters. We apply it to the cluster lens SDSS J1004+4112, whose rich
lensing data includes two time delays. We find, assuming a concordance
cosmology, that the time delays constrain the central region of the cluster to
be rounder and less lopsided than would be allowed by lensed images alone. This
detailed information about the distribution of the matter is very useful for
studying the dense regions of the galaxy clusters which are very difficult to
study with direct measurements. A further time-delay measurement, which is
expected, will make this system even more interesting.

reduction to construct Einstein-Maxwell with gauge group $U(1)^M$. The second
operation turns gravitons into gluons and we call it ""squeezing"". This gives
rise to a formula for all multi-trace mixed amplitudes in Einstein-Yang-Mills.
Dimensionally reducing Yang-Mills we find the S-matrix of a special
Yang-Mills-Scalar (YMS) theory, and by the squeezing operation we find that of
a YMS theory with an additional cubic scalar vertex. A corollary of the YMS
formula gives one for a single massless scalar with a $\phi^4$ interaction.
Starting again from Einstein's theory but in $d+d$ dimensions we introduce a
""generalized dimensional reduction"" that produces the Born-Infeld theory or a
special Galileon theory in $d$ dimensions depending on how it is applied. An
extension of Born-Infeld formula leads to one for the Dirac-Born-Infeld (DBI)
theory. By applying the same operation to Yang-Mills we obtain the $U(N)$
non-linear sigma model (NLSM). Finally, we show how the Kawai-Lewellen-Tye
relations naturally follow from our formulation and provide additional
connections among these theories. One such relation constructs DBI from YMS and

pure Prolog is a logical formula, yet shows creditable performance on long
linked lists. But such executable specifications are a compromise: the logic is
distorted by algorithmic considerations, yet only indirectly executable via an
abstract machine. This paper introduces relational programming, a method that
solves the difficulty with logic programming by a separation of concerns. It
requires three texts: (1) the axioms, a logical formula that specifies the
problem and is not compromised by algorithmic considerations, (2) the theorem,
a logical formula that expresses the idea of the algorithm and follows from the
axioms, and (3) the code, a transcription of the theorem to a procedural
language. Correctness of the code relies on the logical relationship of the
theorem with the axioms and relies on an accurate transcription of the theorem
to the procedural language. Sorting is an example where relational programming
has the advantage of a higher degree of abstractness: the data to be sorted can
be any data type in C++ (the procedural language we use in our examples) that
satisfies the axioms of linear order, while the pure-Prolog version is limited
to data structures in the form of linked cells. We show another advantage of
relational programs: they have a model-theoretic and fixpoint semantics
equivalent to each other and analogous to those of pure Prolog programs.

dumbbell structures. Furthermore, dumbbell structures occur not only on single

the possible role of quantum interference and sink effects in the
nonphotochemical quenching (NPQ) in light-harvesting complexes (LHCs). Our
model consists of a network of five interconnected sites (excitonic states)
responsible for the NPQ mechanism: (i) Two excited states of chlorophyll
molecules, $ChlA^*$ and $ChlB^*$, forming an LHC dimer, which is initially
populated; (ii) A ""damaging"" site which is responsible for production of
singlet oxygen and other destructive outcomes; (iii) The $(ChlA-Zea)^*$
heterodimer excited state (Zea indicates zeaxanthin); and (iv) The charge
transfer state of this heterodimer, $(ChlA^{-}-Zea^{+})^*$. In our model, both
damaging and charge transfer states are described by discrete electron energy
levels attached to their sinks, that mimic the continuum part of electron
energy spectrum, as at these sites the electron participates in
quasi-irreversible chemical reactions. All five excitonic sites interact with
the protein environment that is modeled using a stochastic approach. As an
example, we apply our model to demonstrate possible contributions of quantum
interference and sink effects in the NPQ mechanism in the CP29 minor LHC. Our
numerical results on the quantum dynamics of the reduced density matrix,
demonstrate a possible way to significantly suppress, under some conditions,
the damaging channel using quantum interference effects and sinks. The results
demonstrate the possible role of interference and sink effects for modeling,
engineering, and optimizing the performance of the NPQ processes in both
natural and artificial light-harvesting complexes.

dimensions, that is, when the hidden state lies in $\mathbb{R}^d$ with $d$
large. For low dimensional problems, one of the most popular numerical
procedures for consistent inference is the class of approximations termed
particle filters or sequential Monte Carlo methods. However, in high
dimensions, standard particle filters (e.g. the bootstrap particle filter) can
have a cost that is exponential in $d$ for the algorithm to be stable in an
appropriate sense. We develop a new particle filter, called the
\emph{space-time particle filter}, for a specific family of state-space models
in discrete time. This new class of particle filters provide consistent Monte
Carlo estimates for any fixed $d$, as do standard particle filters. Moreover,
we expect that the state-space particle filter will scale much better with $d$
than the standard filter. We illustrate this analytically for a model of a
simple i.i.d. structure and one of a Markovian structure in the $d$-dimensional
space-direction, when we show that the algorithm exhibits certain stability
properties as $d$ increases at a cost $\mathcal{O}(nNd^2)$, where $n$ is the
time parameter and $N$ is the number of Monte Carlo samples, that are fixed and
independent of $d$. Similar results are expected to hold, under a more general
structure than the i.i.d.~one. independently of the dimension. Our theoretical
results are also supported by numerical simulations on practical models of
complex structures. The results suggest that it is indeed possible to tackle
some high dimensional filtering problems using the space-time particle filter
that standard particle filters cannot handle.

is common to assume equal variances in the two arms of each study. This leads
to Cohen's $d$ estimates for which interpretation is simple. However, this
simplicity should not be used as a justification for the assumption of equal
variances in situations where evidence may suggest that it is incorrect. Until
now, researchers have either used an $F$-test for each individual study as a
justification for the equality of variances or perhaps even conveniently
ignored such tools altogether. In this paper we propose using a meta-analysis
of F-test statistics to estimate the ratio of variances prior to the
combination of SMD's. This procedure allows some studies to be included that
might otherwise be omitted by individual fixed level tests for unequal
variances, sometimes occur even when the assumption of equal variances holds.
The estimated ratio of variances, as well as associated confidence intervals,
can be used as guidance as to whether the assumption of equal variances is
violated. The estimators considered include variance stabilization
transformations (VST) of the $F$-test statistics as well as MLE estimators. The
VST approaches enable the use of QQ-plots to visually inspect for violations of
equal variances while the MLE estimator easily allows for the introduction of a
random effect. When there is evidence of unequal variances, this work provides
a means to formally justify the use of less common methods such as log ratio of
means when studies are measured on a different scale.

integrated framework to assess the impact of precipitation and groundwater on
vegetation growth in the Xiliao River Plain of northern China. The integrated
framework systematically combines remote sensing technology with water flow
modeling in the vadose zone and field data analysis. The vegetation growth is
quantitatively evaluated with the remote sensing data by the Normalized
Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and the simulated plant water uptake rates.
The correlations among precipitation, groundwater depth and NDVI are
investigated by using Pearson correlation equations. The results provide
insights for understanding interactions between precipitation and groundwater
and their contributions to vegetation growth. Strong correlations between
groundwater depth, plant water uptake and NDVI are found in parts of the study
area during a ten-year drought period. The numerical modeling results indicate
that there is an increased correlation between the groundwater depth and
vegetation growth and that groundwater significantly contributes to sustaining
effective soil moisture for vegetation growth during the long drought period.
Therefore, a decreasing groundwater table might pose a great threat to the
survival of vegetation during a long drought period.

  As a specific problem in this genre, we consider the unrelated machine
scheduling problem with startup costs and arbitrary $\ell_p$ norms on machine
loads (including the surprisingly non-trivial $\ell_1$ norm representing total
machine load). This problem was studied earlier for the makespan norm in both
the offline (Khuller~{\em et al.}, SODA 2010; Li and Khuller, SODA 2011) and
online settings (Azar {\em et al.}, SODA 2013). We adapt the two-phase approach
of obtaining a fractional solution and then rounding it online (used
successfully to many linear objectives) to the non-linear objective. The
fractional algorithm uses ideas from our general framework that we described
above (but does not fit the framework exactly because of non-positive entries
in the constraint matrix). The rounding algorithm uses ideas from offline
rounding of LPs with non-linear objectives (Azar and Epstein, STOC 2005; Kumar
{\em et al.}, FOCS 2005). Our competitive ratio is tight up to a logarithmic
factor. Finally, for the important special case of total load ($\ell_1$ norm),
we give a different rounding algorithm that obtains a better competitive ratio
than the generic rounding algorithm for $\ell_p$ norms. We show that this
competitive ratio is asymptotically tight.

virial equilibrium of haloes. The $J-M$ relation in the linear regime contains
the information of the power spectrum and cosmological model. The $J-M$

quite a powerful way of representing knowledge regarding causality. However, a
number of authors have given examples that seem to show that the Halpern-Pearl
(HP) definition of causality gives intuitively unreasonable answers. Here it is
shown that, for each of these examples, we can give two stories consistent with
the description in the example, such that intuitions regarding causality are
quite different for each story. By adding additional variables, we can
disambiguate the stories. Moreover, in the resulting causal models, the HP
definition of causality gives the intuitively correct answer. It is also shown
that, by adding extra variables, a modification to the original HP definition
made to deal with an example of Hopkins and Pearl may not be necessary. Given
how much can be done by adding extra variables, there might be a concern that
the notion of causality is somewhat unstable. Can adding extra variables in a
""conservative"" way (i.e., maintaining all the relations between the variables
in the original model) cause the answer to the question ""Is X=x a cause of Y=y""
to alternate between ""yes"" and ""no""? It is shown that we can have such
alternation infinitely often, but if we take normality into consideration, we
cannot. Indeed, under appropriate normality assumptions. adding an extra
variable can change the answer from ""yes"" to ""no"", but after that, it cannot
cannot change back to ""yes"".

theories using Monte Carlo methods. Some sign problems that had remained
unsolved earlier can be solved within this framework. In this work we argue
that the fermion bag also gives insight into a new mechanism of fermion mass
generation, especially at strong couplings where fermion masses are related to
the fermion bag size. On the other hand, chiral condensates arise due to zero
modes in the Dirac operator within a fermion bag. Although in traditional
four-fermion models the two quantities seem to be related, we show that they
can be decoupled. While fermion bags become small at strong couplings, the
ability of zero modes of the Dirac operator within fermion bags to produce a
chiral condensate, can be suppressed by the presence of additional zero modes
from other fermions. Thus, fermions can become massive even without a chiral
condensate. This new mechanism of mass generation was discovered long ago in
lattice field theory, but has remained unappreciated. Recent work suggests that
it may be of interest even in continuum quantum field theory.

inclusion of osmotic pressure difference and tensile stress or otherwise. Using

distributes data over several cloud ser-vice providers, thus enforcing data
privacy and availability. fVSS addresses four shortcomings in existing secret
sharing-based approaches. First, it allows refreshing the data ware-house when
some service providers fail. Second, it allows on-line analysis processing.
Third, it enforces data integrity with the help of both inner and outer
signatures. Fourth, it helps users control the cost of cloud warehousing by
balanc-ing the load among service providers with respect to their pricing
policies. To illustrate fVSS' efficiency, we thoroughly compare it with

construct an analytic scaling function using holography, appropriate for

work we study variability properties of the band-limited noise component during
the low-hard state for a sample of black hole X-ray binaries. We investigate
the characteristic frequency and amplitude of the band-limited noise component
and study covariance spectra. For observations that show a noise component with
a characteristic frequency above one Hz in the hard energy band (4 - 8 keV) we
found this very same component at a lower frequency in the soft band (1 - 2
keV). This difference in characteristic frequency is an indication that while
both the soft and the hard band photons contribute to the same band-limited
noise component, which likely represents the modulation of the mass accretion
rate, the soft photons origin actually further away from the black hole than
the hard photons. Thus the soft photons are characterized by larger radii,
lower frequencies and softer energies, and are probably associated with a
smaller optical depth for Comptonisation up-scattering from the outer layer of
the corona, or suggesting of a temperature gradient of the corona. We interpret
this energy dependence within the picture of energy-dependent power density
states as a hint that the contribution of the up-scattered photons originating
in the outskirts of the Comptonising corona to the overall emission in the soft
band is becoming significant.

Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) data analysis. Here, we present a
nonparametric estimate of the temperature angular power spectrum for the Planck
2013 CMB data. The method implemented in this work is model-independent, and
allows the data, rather than the model, to dictate the fit. Since one of the
main targets of our analysis is to test the consistency of the $\Lambda$CDM
model with Planck 2013 data, we use the nuisance parameters associated with the
best-fit $\Lambda$CDM angular power spectrum to remove foreground contributions
from the data at multipoles $\ell \geq50$. We thus obtain a combined angular
power spectrum data set together with the full covariance matrix, appropriately
weighted over frequency channels. Our subsequent nonparametric analysis
resolves six peaks (and five dips) up to $\ell \sim1850$ in the temperature
angular power spectrum. We present uncertainties in the peak/dip locations and
heights at the $95\%$ confidence level. We further show how these reflect the
harmonicity of acoustic peaks, and can be used for acoustic scale estimation.
Based on this nonparametric formalism, we found the best-fit $\Lambda$CDM model
to be at $36\%$ confidence distance from the center of the nonparametric
confidence set -- this is considerably larger than the confidence distance
($9\%$) derived earlier from a similar analysis of the WMAP 7-year data.
Another interesting result of our analysis is that at low multipoles, the
Planck data do not suggest any upturn, contrary to the expectation based on the
integrated Sachs-Wolfe contribution in the best-fit $\Lambda$CDM cosmology.

  Contributions","10 pages, 2 figures, published version","Physics Letters B746 (2015) 379",,,"hep-ph hep-th","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Based on two postulations that (i) the Higgs boson has a large bare mass $m_H
\gg m_h \simeq 125 $ GeV at the characteristic energy scale $M_c$ which defines
the standard model (SM) in the ultraviolet region, and (ii) quadratic
contributions of Feynman loop diagrams in quantum field theories are physically
meaningful, we show that the SM electroweak symmetry breaking is induced by the
quadratic contributions from loop effects. As the quadratic running of Higgs
mass parameter leads to an additive renormalization, which distinguishes from
the logarithmic running with a multiplicative renormalization, the symmetry
breaking occurs once the sliding energy scale $\mu$ moves from $M_c$ down to a
transition scale $\mu =\Lambda_{EW}$ at which the additive renormalized Higgs
mass parameter $m^2_H(M_c/\mu)$ gets to change the sign. With the input of
current experimental data, this symmetry breaking energy scale is found to be
$\Lambda_{EW}\simeq 760$ GeV, which provides another basic energy scale for the
SM besides $M_c$. Studying such a symmetry breaking mechanism could play an
important role in understanding both the hierarchy problem and naturalness
problem. It also provides a possible way to explore the experimental
implications of the quadratic contributions as $\Lambda_{EW}$ lies within the
probing reach of the LHC and the future Great Collider.

range of the infrared and terahertz spectrum. Lasing action is achieved by
using optical intersubband transitions between quantized states in specifically
designed multiple-quantum-well heterostructures. A systematic improvement of
quantum cascade lasers with respect to operating temperature, efficiency and
spectral range requires detailed modeling of the underlying physical processes
in these structures. Moreover, the quantum cascade laser constitutes a
versatile model device for the development and improvement of simulation
techniques in nano- and optoelectronics. This review provides a comprehensive
survey and discussion of the modeling techniques used for the simulation of
quantum cascade lasers. The main focus is on the modeling of carrier transport
in the nanostructured gain medium, while the simulation of the optical cavity
is covered at a more basic level. Specifically, the transfer matrix and finite
difference methods for solving the one-dimensional Schr\""odinger equation and
Schr\""odinger-Poisson system are discussed, providing the quantized states in
the multiple-quantum-well active region. The modeling of the optical cavity is
covered with a focus on basic waveguide resonator structures. Furthermore,
various carrier transport simulation methods are discussed, ranging from basic
empirical approaches to advanced self-consistent techniques. The methods
include empirical rate equation and related Maxwell-Bloch equation approaches,
self-consistent rate equation and ensemble Monte Carlo methods, as well as
quantum transport approaches, in particular the density matrix and
non-equilibrium Green's function (NEGF) formalism. The derived scattering rates
and self-energies are generally valid for n-type devices based on
one-dimensional quantum confinement, such as quantum well structures.

(AP) test to measure the expansion history of the Universe. It uses the
isotropy of the galaxy density gradient field to constrain cosmological
parameters. If the density parameter $\Omega_m$ or the dark energy equation of
state $w$ are incorrectly chosen, the gradient field appears to be anisotropic
with the degree of anisotropy varying with redshift. We use this effect to
constrain the cosmological parameters governing the expansion history of the
Universe. Although redshift-space distortions (RSD) induced by galaxy peculiar
velocities also produce anisotropies in the gradient field, these effects are
close to uniform in magnitude over a large range of redshift. This makes the
redshift variation of the gradient field anisotropy relatively insensitive to
the RSD. By testing the method on mock surveys drawn from the Horizon Run 3
cosmological N-body simulations, we demonstrate that the cosmological
parameters can be estimated without bias. Our method is complementary to the
baryon acoustic oscillation or topology methods as it depends on $D_AH$, the
product of the angular diameter distance and the Hubble parameter.

the ""tidy"", ""augment"" and ""glance"" generics, which arrange a model into three

isotropic ensembles of cluster orientations and perform orientation averaging

energies of the occupied single-particle states, while the weights of the peaks
in PES are given by the depletion of the corresponding level. The different
influences can be disentangled by looking at PES from slightly different photon
frequencies. PAD in the one-photon regime can be characterized by one
parameter, the anisotropy. This single parameter unfolds worthwhile information
when investigating the frequency and state dependences. We also discuss the
case of multi-photon ionization induced by strong infrared laser pulses in
C$_{60}$. In agreement with measurements, we find that the PES show a regular
comb of peaks separated by the photon energy. Our calculations reveal that this
happens because only very few occupied states of C$_{60}$ near the ionization
threshold contribute to emission and that these few states happen to cooperate
filling the same peaks. The PAD show a steady increase of anisotropy with

To avoid dominant frequencies in the excitation process, we consider a

valence electrons, a process which excites all frequencies with equal weight.
The electron dynamics is investigated from a theoretical perspective using
time-dependent density-functional theory augmented by an average-density
self-interaction correction. We observe patterns which are similar to PES
usually obtained after irradiation by a laser pulse, in particular the
appearance of clear peaks. We show that these patterns are driven by strong

for 13 consecutive days from radio to very high energy (VHE, E > 100 GeV)
gamma-rays with MAGIC, VERITAS, Whipple, FermiLAT, MAXI, RXTE, Swift,
GASP-WEBT, and several optical and radio telescopes. We model the day-scale
SEDs with one-zone and two-zone synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) models,
investigate the physical parameters, and evaluate whether the observed
broadband SED variability can be associated to variations in the relativistic
particle population.
  Flux variability was remarkable in the X-ray and VHE bands while it was minor
or not significant in the other bands. The one-zone SSC model can describe
reasonably well the SED of each day for the 13 consecutive days. This flaring
activity is also very well described by a two-zone SSC model, where one zone is
responsible for the quiescent emission while the other smaller zone, which is
spatially separated from the first one, contributes to the daily-variable
emission occurring in X-rays and VHE gamma-rays.
  Both the one-zone SSC and the two-zone SSC models can describe the daily SEDs
via the variation of only four or five model parameters, under the hypothesis
that the variability is associated mostly to the underlying particle
population. This shows that the particle acceleration and cooling mechanism
producing the radiating particles could be the main one responsible for the
broadband SED variations during the flaring episodes in blazars. The two-zone
SSC model provides a better agreement to the observed SED at the narrow peaks
of the low- and high-energy bumps during the highest activity, although the
reported one-zone SSC model could be further improved by the variation of the
parameters related to the emitting region itself ($\delta$, $B$ and $R$), in
addition to the parameters related to the particle population.

$0.91-1.32\mu$m with a newly-developed near-infrared (NIR) spectrograph,
WINERED, mounted on the Araki 1.3 m Telescope in Japan. We obtained
high-resolution ($R=28,300$) spectra of 25 early-type stars with color excesses
of $0.07<E(B-V)<3.4$. In addition to the five DIBs previously detected in this
wavelength range, we identified 15 new DIBs, 7 of which were reported as DIB
""candidates"" by Cox. We analyze the correlations among NIR DIBs, strong optical
DIBs, and the reddening of the stars. Consequently, we found that all NIR DIBs
show weaker correlations with the reddening rather than the optical DIBs,
suggesting that the equivalent widths of NIR DIBs depend on some physical
conditions of the interstellar clouds, such as UV flux. Three NIR DIBs,
$\lambda\lambda$10780, 10792, and 11797, are found to be classifiable as a
""family,"" in which the DIBs are well correlated with each other, suggesting
that the carriers of these DIBs are connected with some chemical reactions
and/or have similar physical properties such as ionization potential. We also
found that three strongest NIR DIBs $\lambda\lambda10780, 11797, 13175$ are
well correlated with the optical DIB $\lambda 5780.5$, whose carrier is
proposed to be a cation molecule with high ionization potential, indicating
that the carriers of the NIR DIBs could be cation molecules.

presence of a background magnetic field perpendicular to the plane, i.e. the
Landau system in a phase-space where the coordinates and momenta both follow
canonical noncommutative algebra. A set of generalized transformations is
derived in this paper which maps the NC problem to an equivalent commutative
problem. In this set up, we study the Aharonov-Bohm effect and the Landau
levels. For the Aharonov-Bohm effect, the phase-shift is found to contain
corrections due to phase-space noncommutativity and also depends on the scaling
parameter appearing in the generalized transformations. The result agrees with
those in the literature upto first order in the noncommutative parameters when
proper choice of the scaling parameter is taken. We then obtain the magnetic
length and degeneracy of the Landau levels, both are seen to admit NC
corrections. The Landau levels are seen to get altered due to phase-space
noncommutativity as well. This energy spectrum of the Landau system is computed
from two different perspectives, namely the explicit NC variable approach and
the commutative-equivalent approach. The results match exactly, solidifying the
evidence in favour of the equivalence of the two approaches.

say, in distinct traps or in remote sites of a lattice, can be used to
implement an entangling quantum gate between them. The scattering takes place
under 1D confinement for which we consider two different scenarios: a 1D
wave-guide and a tight-binding lattice. We consider models with contact-like
interaction between two fermionic or two bosonic particles. A qubit is encoded
in two distinct spins (or other internal) states of each particle. Our scheme
enables the implementation of a gate between two qubits which are initially too
far to interact directly, and provides an alternative to photonic mediators for
the scaling of quantum computers. Fundamentally, an interesting feature is that
""identical particles"" (e.g., two atoms of the same species) and the 1D
confinement, are both necessary for the action of the gate. Finally, we discuss
the feasibility of our scheme, the degree of control required to initialize the
wave-packets momenta, and show how the quality of the gate is affected by
momentum distributions and initial distance. In a lattice, the control of
quasi-momenta is naturally provided by few local edge impurities in the lattice
potential.

theoretically by means of a star-like network of overdamped bistable systems,

the amplification's strength, while the topology-induced amplification
mechanism is robust against this kind of quenched disorder in the sense that it
does not significantly change the values of the coupling strength where

These particular features occur, .e.g., in heterogeneously charged colloidal
systems. Here we consider overall neutral IPCs carrying two, relatively small,
polar patches. Previous studies of the same model under planar confinement have
evidenced the formation of branched, disordered aggregates composed of
ring-like structures. We investigate here the bulk behavior of the system via
molecular dynamics simulations, focusing on both the structure and the dynamics
of the fluid phase in a wide region of the phase diagram. Additionally, the
simulation results for the static observables are compared to the Associative
Percus Yevick solution of an integral equation approach based on the

execution monitor is to identify inconsistencies between runtime observations
of the target system and predictions of the System Architectural Model.
Therefore, to achieve this goal, we first define the formal (denotational)
semantics of the observations (runtime events) and predictions (executable

towards planet formation. The size and shape of the growing aggregates
determine the efficiency of this early growth. It has been proposed that fluffy
ice aggregates can grow very efficiently, suffering less from the bouncing and
radial drift barriers. While the collision velocity between icy aggregates of
similar size is thought to stay below the fragmentation threshold, they may
nonetheless lose mass from collisions with much smaller projectiles. We
investigate the effect of these erosive collisions on the ability of porous ice
aggregates to cross the radial drift barrier. We develop a Monte Carlo code
that calculates the evolution of the growing aggregates, while resolving the
entire mass distribution at all times. The aggregate's porosity is treated
independently of its mass, and is determined by collisions, gas compaction, and
eventually self-gravity compaction. For erosion threshold velocities of 20-40
m/s, high-velocity collisions with small projectiles prevent the largest
aggregates from growing when they start to drift. In these cases, our local
simulations result in a steady-state distribution, with the majority of the
dust mass in particles with Stokes numbers close to unity. Only for the highest
erosion threshold considered (60 m/s), do porous aggregates manage to cross the
radial drift barrier in the inner 10 AU of MMSN-like disks. Erosive collisions
are more effective in limiting the growth than fragmentary collisions between
similar-size particles. Conceivably, erosion limits the growth before the
radial drift barrier, although the robustness of this statement depends on
(uncertain) material properties of icy aggregates. If erosion inhibits
planetesimal formation through direct sticking, the sea of ${\sim}10^9$ g,
highly porous particles appears well-suited for triggering streaming
instability.

compute accurate general-relativistic solutions for the electromagnetic field

this problem by including the important effect of plasma screening. This is
achieved by solving the time-dependent Maxwell equations in a curved space-time

pseudo-spectral methods in order to allow for possible discontinuities in the
solution. Our algorithm based on a multi-domain decomposition of the simulation

several sets of simulations to look for the general-relativistic force-free

powerful in handling extended domains of hundredth of light-cylinder

proposed which involve optimising either a constrained or penalised cost
function over possible numbers and locations of changepoints using dynamic
programming. Such methods are typically computationally intensive. Recent work
in the penalised optimisation setting has focussed on developing a
pruning-based approach which gives an improved computational cost that, under
certain conditions, is linear in the number of data points. Such an approach
naturally requires the specification of a penalty to avoid under/over-fitting.
Work has been undertaken to identify the appropriate penalty choice for data
generating processes with known distributional form, but in many applications
the model assumed for the data is not correct and these penalty choices are not
always appropriate. Consequently it is desirable to have an approach that
enables us to compare segmentations for different choices of penalty. To this
end we present a method to obtain optimal changepoint segmentations of data
sequences for all penalty values across a continuous range. This permits an
evaluation of the various segmentations to identify a suitably parsimonious
penalty choice. The computational complexity of this approach can be linear in
the number of data points and linear in the difference between the number of
changepoints in the optimal segmentations for the smallest and largest penalty
values. This can be orders of magnitude faster than alternative approaches that
find optimal segmentations for a range of the number of changepoints.

more calls of higher priority traffic classes can be accommodated by blocking
some more calls of lower priority traffic classes. Diverse types of high data
rate traffic are supported by existing wireless communication systems while the
resource is limited. Hence, priority based resource allocation can ensure the
service quality for the calls of important traffic class. The fixed guard

reduction of the call blocking probability of higher priority calls along with

well-known variant of the coupon collector's problem, where the object of study
is the number $T_{m}(N)$ of coupons that a collector has to buy in order to
complete $m$ sets of all $N$ existing different coupons. More precisely, the
problem is to determine the asymptotics of the expectation (and the variance)
of $T_{m}(N)$, as well as its limit distribution, as the number $N$ of
different coupons becomes arbitrarily large. The classical case of the problem,
namely the case of equal coupon probabilities, is here extended to the general
case, where the probabilities of the selected coupons are unequal.
  In the beginning of the article we give a brief review of the formulas for
the moments and the moment generating function of the random variable
$T_{m}(N)$. Then, we develop techniques of computing the asymptotics of the
first and the second moment of $T_{m}(N)$ (our techniques apply to the higher
moments of $T_{m}(N)$ as well). From these asymptotic formulas we obtain the
leading behavior of the variance $V[\,T_{m}(N)\,]$ as $N \to \infty$. Finally,
based on the asymptotics of $E[\,T_{m}(N)\,]$ and $V[\,T_{m}(N)\,]$ we obtain
the limit distribution of the random variable $T_{m}(N)$ for large classes of
coupon probabilities. As it turns out, in many cases, albeit not always,
$T_{m}(N)$ (appropriately normalized) converges in distribution to a Gumbel
random variable. Our results on the limit distribution of $T_{m}(N)$ generalize
a well-known result of P. Erd\H{o}s and A. R\'{e}nyi (1961) regarding the limit
distribution of $T_{m}(N)$ for the case of equal coupon probabilities.

services over the wireless cellular networks, it is required to efficiently
manage the wireless resources in order to reduce the overall forced call

reduces the quality of the MBS videos and bandwidth utilization or increases
the overall forced call termination probability and of course the handover call

variable bit rate allocation for the video services. In this paper, we propose
a bandwidth allocation scheme that efficiently allocates bandwidth among the

for the MBS sessions during the congested traffic condition only to accommodate
more calls in the system. Instead of allocating fixed bandwidths for the BMS

them. However, the minimum quality of the videos is guaranteed by allocating
minimum bandwidth for them. Using the mathematical and numerical analyses, we

traffic types is more challenging due to the need to minimize two performance
metrics - the probability of dropping a handover call and the probability of
blocking a new call. Since QoS requirements are not as stringent for
non-real-time traffic types, as opposed to real-time traffic, more calls can be
accommodated by releasing some bandwidth from the already admitted
non-real-time traffic calls. If we require that such a released bandwidth to
accept a handover call ought to be larger than the bandwidth to accept a new
call, then the resulting probability of dropping a handover call will be
smaller than the probability of blocking a new call. In this paper we propose
an efficient Call Admission Control (CAC) that relies on adaptive multi-level
bandwidth-allocation scheme for non-real-time calls. The scheme allows
reduction of the call dropping probability along with increase of the bandwidth
utilization. The numerical results show that the proposed scheme is capable of
attaining negligible handover call dropping probability without sacrificing
bandwidth utilization.

inferring the latent variables of a system and their causal relations with the
observed behavior. Learning a Hidden Markov Model of given stochastic process
is a textbook example, known as the positive realization problem (PRP). The PRP
and its solutions have far-reaching consequences in many areas of systems and
control theory, and positive systems theory.
  We consider the scenario where the latent variables are quantum states, and
the system dynamics is constrained only by physical transformations on the
quantum system. The observable dynamics is then described by a quantum
instrument, and the task is to determine which quantum instrument --if any--
yields the process at hand by iterative application.
  We take as starting point the theory of quasi-realizations, whence a
description of the dynamics of the process is given in terms of linear maps on
state vectors and probabilities are given by linear functionals on the state
vectors. This description, despite its remarkable resemblance with the Hidden
Markov Model, or the iterated quantum instrument, is nevertheless devoid of any
stochastic or quantum mechanical interpretation, as said maps fail to satisfy
any positivity conditions. The Completely-Positive realization problem then
consists in determining whether an equivalent quantum mechanical description of
the same process exists.
  We generalize some key results of stochastic realization theory, and show
that the problem has deep connections with operator systems theory, yielding
possible insight to the lifting problem in quotient operator systems. Our
results have potential applications in quantum machine learning,
device-independent characterization and reverse-engineering of stochastic

from the basis $\Lambda^{\prime}$, discovered independently by Hoste--Kidwell
\cite{HK} and Turaev \cite{Tu} with the use of diagrammatic methods. For
finding the basis $\Lambda$ we use the generalized Hecke algebra of type B,
$\textrm{H}_{1,n}$, defined by the second author in \cite{La2}, which is
generated by looping elements and braiding elements and which is isomorphic to
the affine Hecke algebra of type A. Namely, we start with the well-known basis
of $\mathcal{S}({\rm ST})$, $\Lambda^{\prime}$, and an appropriate linear basis
$\Sigma_n$ of the algebra $\textrm{H}_{1,n}$. We then convert elements in
$\Lambda^{\prime}$ to linear combinations of elements in the new basic set
$\Lambda$. This is done in two steps: First we convert elements in
$\Lambda^{\prime}$ to elements in $\Sigma_n$. Then, using conjugation and the
stabilization moves, we convert these elements to linear combinations of
elements in $\Lambda$ by managing gaps in the indices of the looping elements
and by eliminating braiding tails in the words. Further, we define an ordering
relation in $\Lambda^{\prime}$ and $\Lambda$ and prove that the sets are
totally ordered. Finally, using this ordering, we relate the sets
$\Lambda^{\prime}$ and $\Lambda$ via a block diagonal matrix, where each block
is an infinite lower triangular matrix with invertible elements in the diagonal
and we prove linear independence of the set $\Lambda$. The infinite matrix is
then ""invertible"" and thus, the set $\Lambda$ is a basis for $\mathcal{S}({\rm

In this state, the system spontaneously differentiates into the up-spin kagome

determinations of the top quark mass parameter of Monte-Carlo (MC) event
generators reaching uncertainties of well below $1$ GeV. However, there is an
additional theoretical problem when using the MC top mass $m_t^{\rm MC}$ as an
input for theoretical predictions, because a rigorous relation of $m_t^{\rm
MC}$ to a renormalized field theory mass is, at the very strict level, absent.
In this talk I show how - nevertheless - some concrete statements on $m_t^{\rm
MC}$ can be deduced assuming that the MC generator behaves like a rigorous
first principles QCD calculator for the observables that are used for the
analyses. I give simple conceptual arguments showing that in this context
$m_t^{\rm MC}$ can be interpreted like the mass of a heavy-light top meson, and
that there is a conversion relation to field theory top quark masses that
requires a non-perturbative input. The situation is in analogy to B physics
where a similar relation exists between experimental B meson masses and field
theory bottom masses. The relation gives a prescription how to use $m_t^{\rm
MC}$ as an input for theoretical predictions in perturbative QCD. The outcome
is that at this time an additional uncertainty of about $1$ GeV has to be
accounted for. I discuss limitations of the arguments I give and possible ways
to test them, or even to improve the current situation.

neutron numbers 122 $\le$ N $\le$ 156 is studied, both at the mean field level
and beyond, using the Gogny energy density functional. Besides the robustness
of the N=126 neutron shell closure, it is shown that the onset of static
deformations in those isotopic chains with increasing neutron number leads to
an enhanced stability and further extends the corresponding two-neutron
driplines far beyond what could be expected from spherical calculations.
Independence of the mean field predictions with respect to the particular
version of the Gogny energy density functional employed is demonstrated by
comparing results based on the D1S and D1M parameter sets. Correlations beyond
mean field are taken into account in the framework of the angular momentum
projected generator coordinate method calculation. It is shown that N=126
remains a robust neutron magic number when dynamical effects are included. The
analysis of the collective wave functions, average deformations and excitation
energies indicate that, with increasing neutron number, the zero-point quantum
corrections lead to dominant prolate configurations in the 0$_{1}^{+}$,
0$_{2}^{+}$, 2$_{1}^{+}$ and 2$_{2}^{+}$ states of the studied nuclei.
Moreover, those dynamical deformation effects provide an enhanced stability
that further supports the mean field predictions, corroborating a shift of the
r-process path to higher neutron numbers. Beyond mean field calculations
provide a smaller shell gap at N=126 than the mean field one in good agreement
with previous theoretical studies. However, the shell gap still remains strong
enough in the two-neutron driplines.

consequences of MM and PFA, thus providing a useful insight on the
combinatorial structure of the theory of forcing axioms.
  In the first part of this notes we will give a brief account on forcing
axioms, introducing some equivalent definition by means of generalized
stationarity and presenting the consequences of them in terms of generic
absoluteness.
  In the second part we will state the strong reflection principle (SRP), prove
it under MM and examine its main consequences. This axiom is defined in terms
of reflection properties of generalized stationary set.
  In the third part we will state the open coloring axiom (OCA), and provide
consistency proofs for some versions of it. This axiom can be seen as a sort of
two-dimensional perfect set property, i.e. the basic descriptive set theory
result that every analytic set is either countable or it contains a perfect
subset.

concerning properties of the continuum, in particular the existence of certain

In many applications these models are incomplete, which both reduces the
prospects of detection and leads to a systematic error in the parameter
estimates. In the analysis of data from gravitational wave detectors, for
example, accurate waveform templates can be computed using numerical methods,
but the prohibitive cost of these simulations means this can only be done for a
small handful of parameters. In this work a novel method to fold model
uncertainties into data analysis is proposed; the waveform uncertainty is
analytically marginalised over using with a prior distribution constructed by
using Gaussian process regression to interpolate the waveform difference from a
small training set of accurate templates. The method is well motivated, easy to
implement, and no more computationally expensive than standard techniques. The
new method is shown to perform extremely well when applied to a toy problem.
While we use the application to gravitational wave data analysis to motivate

He-4 stage. A much reduced condensation time (factor of 2) of the He-3/He-4 gas
mixture at the beginning of an experiment is achieved. A compressor is no
longer needed with the DR as the condensation pressure remains below
atmospheric pressure at all times; thus the risk of losing expensive He-3 gas
is small. The performance of the DR has been improved compared to previous
work: The base temperature of the mixing chamber at a small He-3 flow rate is
now 4.1 mK; at the highest He-3 flow rate of 1.2 mmol/s this temperature
increases to 13 mK. Mixing chamber temperatures were measured with a cerium

Our study reveals that the inverse of the largest eigenvalue of the

that the number of acyclic orientations of complete bipartite graphs on $n$

is suggested, taking advantage of the relationship with graph colouring through
the result of Stanley, namely the value of the graph colouring polynomial at
the value -1.

prove that these perturbations trigger instabilities in the SM on the scale of
the supernova data. These instabilities create a large, central region of
uniform under-density which expands faster than the SM, and this central region
of accelerated uniform expansion introduces into the SM {\it precisely} the
same range of corrections to redshift vs luminosity as are produced by the
cosmological constant in the theory of Dark Energy. A universal behavior is
exhibited because all sufficiently small perturbations evolve to a single
stable rest point. Moreover, we prove that these perturbations are consistent
with, and the instability is triggered by, the one parameter family of
self-similar waves which the authors previously proposed as possible
time-asymptotic wave patterns for perturbations of the SM at the end of the
radiation epoch. Using numerical simulations, we calculate the unique wave in
the family that accounts for the same values of the Hubble constant and
quadratic correction to redshift vs luminosity as in a universe with seventy
percent Dark Energy, $\Omega_{\Lambda}\approx.7$. A numerical simulation of the
third order correction associated with that unique wave establishes a testable
prediction that distinguishes this theory from the theory of Dark Energy. This
explanation for the anomalous acceleration, based on instabilities in the SM

them, provides perhaps the simplest mathematical explanation for the anomalous

that the amount of dust on the western side is 2.2 times larger than that on

capture grains at the Lagrangian points to open the eccentric gap. This

a steady operation of a fusion power plant the target implosion should be
robust against the implosion non-uniformities. In this paper the requirement
for the implosion uniformity is first discussed. The implosion uniformity
should be less than a few percent. A study on the fuel hotspot dynamics is also
presented and shows that the stagnating plasma fluid provides a significant
enhancement of vorticity at the final stage of the fuel stagnation. Then
non-uniformity mitigation mechanisms of the heavy ion beam (HIB) illumination
are also briefly discussed in heavy ion inertial fusion (HIF). A density valley
appears in the energy absorber, and the large-scale density valley also works
as a radiation energy confinement layer, which contributes to a radiation
energy smoothing. In HIF a wobbling heavy ion beam illumination was also
introduced to realize a uniform implosion. In the wobbling HIBs illumination,
the illumination non-uniformity oscillates in time and space on a HIF target.
The oscillating-HIB energy deposition may contribute to the reduction of the
HIBs' illumination non-uniformity by its smoothing effect on the HIB
illumination non-uniformity and also by a growth mitigation effect on the

algebraic(differential) system (IAS(IDS)) for that generalized Lie
algebra/algebroid, then the involutivity of the IAS(IDS) in a result of
Frobenius type is characterized. Introducing the notion of exterior
algebraic(differential) system of a generalized Lie algebra(algebroid), the
involutivity of an IAS(IDS) is characterized in a result of Cartan type.
Finally, new directions by research in algebraic(differential) symplectic
spaces theory are presented.

length, this theory must be free from such infinitesimal quantities as
infinitely small variations in surface of the holographic screen, its volume,
and entropy. The corresponding infinitesimal quantities in this case must be
replaced by the ""minimal variations possible"" -- finite quantities dependent on
the existent energies. As a result, the initial low-energy theory (quantum
theory or general relativity) inevitably must be replaced by a minimal-length
theory that gives very close results but operates with absolutely other
mathematical apparatus.
