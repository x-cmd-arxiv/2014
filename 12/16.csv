This problem can be considered a homogeneous variant of the sparse recovery

many other problems in signal processing and machine learning. In this paper,
we focus on a **planted sparse model** for the subspace: the target sparse
vector is embedded in an otherwise random subspace. Simple convex heuristics
for this planted recovery problem provably break down when the fraction of
nonzero entries in the target sparse vector substantially exceeds
$O(1/\sqrt{n})$. In contrast, we exhibit a relatively simple nonconvex approach
based on alternating directions, which provably succeeds even when the fraction
of nonzero entries is $\Omega(1)$. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first practical algorithm to achieve linear scaling under the planted sparse
model. Empirically, our proposed algorithm also succeeds in more challenging
data models, e.g., sparse dictionary learning.

extend the analogy further by means of novel stress-controlled simulations and
show the existence of a non-monotonic steady-state flow curve analogous to a
non-monotonic equation of state. While we associate DST with an S-shaped flow
curve, at volume fractions above the shear jamming transition the frictional
state loses flowability and the flow curve reduces to an arch, permitting the
system to flow only at small stresses. Whereas a thermodynamic transition leads
to phase separation in the coexistence region, we observe a uniform shear flow
all along the thickening transition. A stability analysis suggests that uniform
shear may be mechanically stable for the small Reynolds numbers and system
sizes in a rheometer.

cohomology of a compact oriented manifold is a shifted commutative Frobenius
algebra --- a commutative Frobenius algebra in which the comultiplication has
cohomological degree equal to the dimension of the manifold. We study the
question of whether this structure lifts to a ""homotopy"" shifted commutative
Frobenius algebra structure at the cochain level. To make this question
nontrivial, we impose a mild locality-type condition that we call
""quasilocality"": strict locality at the cochain level is unreasonable, but it
is reasonable to ask for homotopically-constant families of operations that
become local ""in the limit."" To make the question concrete, we take the
manifold to be the one-dimensional circle.
  The answer to whether a quasilocal homotopy-Frobenius algebra structure
exists turns out to depend on the choice of context in which to do homotopy
algebra. There are two reasonable worlds in which to study structures (like
Frobenius algebras) that involve many-to-many operations: one can work at ""tree
level,"" corresponding roughly to the world of operadic homotopy algebras and
their homotopy modules; or one can work at ""graph level,"" corresponding to the
world of PROPs. For the tree-level version of our question, the answer is the
unsurprising ""Yes, such a structure exists"" --- indeed, it is unique up to a
contractible space of choices. But for the graph-level version, the answer is
the surprising ""No, such a structure does not exist."" Most of the paper
consists of computing explicitly this nonexistence, which is controlled by the
numerical value of a certain obstruction, and we compute this value explicitly
via a sequence of integrals.

second-generation interferometric gravitational-wave detectors such as advanced
LIGO and advanced Virgo. While most binaries are expected to possess circular
orbits, some may be eccentric, for example, if they are formed through
dynamical capture. Eccentric orbits can create difficulty for matched filtering
searches due to the challenges of creating effective template banks to detect
these signals. In previous work, we showed how seedless clustering can be used
to detect low-mass ($M_\text{total}\leq10M_\odot$) compact binary coalescences
for both spinning and eccentric systems, assuming a circular post-Newtonian
expansion. Here, we describe a parameterization that is designed to maximize
sensitivity to low-eccentricity ($0\leq\epsilon\leq0.6$) systems, derived from
the analytic equations. We show that this parameterization provides a robust
and computationally efficient method for detecting eccentric low-mass compact
binaries. Based on these results, we conclude that advanced detectors will have
a chance of detecting eccentric binaries if optimistic models prove true.
However, a null observation is unlikely to firmly rule out models of eccentric
binary populations.

show, are the signature of the strong interaction of charge carriers with a
bosonic mode whose characteristic energy coincides with the spin-resonance

a smaller and not easily discernible gap of amplitude $\Delta_H \simeq 1.75 k_B

period of inflation, where these fluctuations were generated. To date, the
cosmic microwave background has been the dominant source of information about
these perturbations. Large scale structure is however from where drastic
improvements should originate. In this paper, we explain the theoretical
motivations for pursuing such measurements and the challenges that lie ahead.
In particular, we discuss and identify theoretical targets regarding the
measurement of primordial non-Gaussianity. We argue that when quantified in
terms of the local (equilateral) template amplitude $f_{\rm NL}^{\rm loc}$
($f_{\rm NL}^{\rm eq}$), natural target levels of sensitivity are $\Delta
f_{\rm NL}^{\rm loc, eq.} \simeq 1$. We highlight that such levels are within
reach of future surveys by measuring 2-, 3- and 4-point statistics of the
galaxy spatial distribution. This paper summarizes a workshop held at CITA

the constraints on the corresponding coupling constants in regions where

paraphoton field is analyzed via a comparison with a model in which the
existence of minicharges is assumed only. For both scenarios is found that the
most stringent exclusion limit occurs at the lowest threshold mass; this one
being determined by a certain combination of the field frequencies and dictated

of its weather-layer jets, quite unlike terrestrial strong jets with their
characteristic unsteadiness and long-wavelength meandering. The problem is
addressed in two steps. The first is to take seriously the classic
Dowling-Ingersoll (DI) 1-1/2-layer scenario and its supporting observational
evidence, pointing toward deep, massive, zonally-symmetric zonal jets in the
underlying dry-convective layer. The second is to improve the realism of the
model stochastic forcing used to represent the effects of Jupiter's moist
convection as far as possible within the 1-1/2-layer dynamics. The real moist
convection should be strongest in the belts where the interface to the deep
flow is highest and coldest, and should generate cyclones as well as
anticyclones with the anticyclones systematically stronger. The new model
forcing reflects these insights. Also, it acts quasifrictionally on large
scales to produce statistically steady turbulent weather-layer regimes without
any need for explicit large-scale dissipation, and with weather-layer jets that
are approximately straight thanks to the influence of the deep jets, allowing
shear stability despite nonmonotonic potential-vorticity gradients when the
Rossby deformation lengthscale is not too large. Moderately strong forcing
produces chaotic vortex dynamics and realistic belt-zone contrasts in the
model's convective activity, through an eddy-induced sharpening and
strengthening of the weather-layer jets relative to the deep jets, tilting the
interface between them. Weak forcing, for which the only jet-sharpening
mechanism is the passive (Kelvin) shearing of vortices (as in the ""CE2"" or
""SSST"" theories), produces unrealistic belt-zone contrasts.

variety of physical systems. As in another recent algorithm, the cost of our
method depends only logarithmically on the inverse of the desired precision,
which is optimal. However, we simplify the algorithm and its analysis by using
a method for implementing linear combinations of unitary operations to directly
apply the truncated Taylor series.

battery cathodes because of their high theoretical capacities. The practical
application of these materials is, however, limited due to poor electrochemical
performance. We herein report a comprehensive first-principles study of defect
physics in LiMnO$_2$ and Li$_2$MnO$_3$ using hybrid-density functional
calculations. We find that manganese antisites have low formation energies in
LiMnO$_2$ and may act as nucleation sites for the formation of impurity phases.
The antisites can also occur with high concentrations in Li$_2$MnO$_3$;
however, unlike in LiMnO$_2$, they can be eliminated by tuning the experimental
conditions during preparation. Other intrinsic point defects may also occur and
have an impact on the materials' properties and functioning. An analysis of the
formation of lithium vacancies indicates that lithium extraction from LiMnO$_2$
is associated with oxidation at the manganese site, resulting in the formation
of manganese small hole polarons; whereas in Li$_2$MnO$_3$ the intrinsic
delithiation mechanism involves oxidation at the oxygen site, leading to the
formation of bound oxygen hole polarons $\eta_{\rm O}^{+}$. The layered oxides
are found to have no or negligible bandlike carriers and they cannot be doped
n- or p-type. The electronic conduction proceeds through hopping of hole and/or
electron polarons; the ionic conduction occurs through lithium monovacancy
and/or divacancy migration mechanisms. Since $\eta_{\rm O}^{+}$ is not stable
in the absence of negatively charged lithium vacancies in bulk Li$_2$MnO$_3$,
the electronic conduction near the start of delithiation is likely to be poor.
We suggest that the electronic conduction associated with $\eta_{\rm O}^{+}$
and, hence, the electrochemical performance of Li$_2$MnO$_3$ can be improved
through nanostructuring and/or ion substitution.

et al. (2010). This simulation hosts a massive bar, which drives strong
resonances and persistent angular momentum exchange. Resonant orbits are found
throughout the disc, both close to the bar itself and out to the very edges of
the disc. Using Fourier spectrograms, we demonstrate that the bar is driving
kinematic substructure even in the very outer parts of the disc. We identify
two major orbit families in the outskirts of the disc that make significant
contributions to the kinematic landscape, namely the m:l = 3:-2 and 1:-1
families resonating with the pattern speed of the bar. A mechanism is described
that produces bimodal distributions of Galactocentric radial velocities at
selected azimuths in the outer disc. It occurs as a result of the temporal
coherence of particles on the 3:-2 resonant orbits, which causes them to arrive
simultaneously at pericentre or apocentre. This resonant clumping, due to the
in-phase motion of the particles through their epicycle, leads to both inward
and outward moving groups which belong to the same orbital family and
consequently produce bimodal radial velocity distributions. This is a possible
explanation of the bimodal velocity distributions observed towards the Galactic
anti-Centre by Liu et al. (2012). Another consequence is that transient
overdensities appear and dissipate (in a symmetric fashion) on timescales equal
to the their epicyclic period resulting in a periodic pulsing of the disc's
surface density.

  Genetic Programming Applications (2015, in press)",,,,"cs.MS cs.NE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  GPTIPS is a free, open source MATLAB based software platform for symbolic
data mining (SDM). It uses a multigene variant of the biologically inspired
machine learning method of genetic programming (MGGP) as the engine that drives
the automatic model discovery process. Symbolic data mining is the process of
extracting hidden, meaningful relationships from data in the form of symbolic
equations. In contrast to other data-mining methods, the structural
transparency of the generated predictive equations can give new insights into
the physical systems or processes that generated the data. Furthermore, this
transparency makes the models very easy to deploy outside of MATLAB. The
rationale behind GPTIPS is to reduce the technical barriers to using,
understanding, visualising and deploying GP based symbolic models of data,
whilst at the same time remaining highly customisable and delivering robust
numerical performance for power users. In this chapter, notable new features of
the latest version of the software are discussed with these aims in mind.
Additionally, a simplified variant of the MGGP high level gene crossover
mechanism is proposed. It is demonstrated that the new functionality of GPTIPS
2 (a) facilitates the discovery of compact symbolic relationships from data
using multiple approaches, e.g. using novel gene-centric visualisation analysis
to mitigate horizontal bloat and reduce complexity in multigene symbolic
regression models (b) provides numerous methods for visualising the properties
of symbolic models (c) emphasises the generation of graphically navigable
libraries of models that are optimal in terms of the Pareto trade off surface
of model performance and complexity and (d) expedites real world applications
by the simple, rapid and robust deployment of symbolic models outside the
software environment they were developed in.

a noncommutative geometry. These processes are characterized by producing
complex values and so, the corresponding Fokker-Planck equation resembles the
Schroedinger equation. Indeed, by a direct numerical check, one can recover the

This class of stochastic processes needs a Clifford algebra to exist. In four

OH65 absorption shows a bimodal distribution with a discontinuity at
L_{FIR}/M_{H2}~100 Lsun/Msun. In the most buried sources, OH65 probes material
partially responsible for the silicate 9.7 um absorption. Combined with
observations of the OH 71 um Pi_{1/2} J=7/2-5/2 doublet (E_{low}~415 K),
radiative transfer models characterized by the equivalent dust temperature,
Tdust, and the continuum optical depth at 100 um, tau_{100}, indicate that
strong [C ii]158 um deficits are associated with far-IR thick (tau_{100}>~0.7,
N_{H}>~10^{24} cm^{-2}), warm (Tdust>~60 K) structures where the OH 65 um
absorption is produced, most likely in circumnuclear disks/tori/cocoons. With
their high L_{FIR}/M_{H2} ratios and columns, the presence of these structures

savanna, the Kruger National Park, were collected across unburnt and annual
burn plots. Indices of aggregation and spatial autocorrelation of the
distribution of trees between different fire regimes were explored. Results
show that the distribution of trees under fire were more clumped and exhibited
higher spatial autocorrelation than in unburnt plots: In burnt plots spatial
autocorrelation values were positive at finer scales and negative at coarser
scales potentially indicating co-existence of facilitation and competition
within the same ecosystem depending on the scale. The pattern derived here

into a strip of unit width and minimum height. These are the first
approximation and resource augmentation schemes for these problems.
  Our algorithm is based on novel ideas of iteratively separating small and
large items, and may be extended to a wide range of packing problems that
satisfy certain conditions. These extensions comprise problems with different

rays (UHECRs) produced by powerful sources is numerically evaluated. We show
that, taking account of the Galactic magnetic field, nondetection of
significant anisotropy at $\approx 10^{19}$ eV at present and in future
experiments imposes general upper limits on UHECR proton luminosity of steady
sources as a function of source redshifts. The upper limits constrain the
existence of typical steady sources in the local universe and limit the local
density of $10^{19}$ eV UHECR sources to be $\gtrsim 10^{-3}$ Mpc$^{-3},$
assuming average intergalactic magnetic fields less than $10^{-9}$ G. This
isotropy, which is stronger than measured at the highest energies, may indicate
the transient generation of UHECRs. Our anisotropy calculations are applied for
extreme high-frequency-peaked BL Lac objects 1ES 0229+200, 1ES 1101-232, and
1ES 0347-121, to test the UHECR-induced cascade model, in which beamed UHECR
protons generate TeV radiation in transit from sources. While the
magnetic-field structure surrounding the sources affects the required absolute
cosmic-ray luminosity of the blazars, the magnetic-field structure surrounding
the Milky Way directly affects the observed anisotropy. If both of the magnetic
fields are weak enough, significant UHECR anisotropy from these blazars should
be detectable by the Pierre Auger Observatory unless the maximum energy of
UHECR protons is well below $10^{19}$ eV. Furthermore, if these are the sources
of UHECRs above $10^{19}$ eV, a local magnetic structure surrounding the Milky
Way is needed to explain the observed isotropy at $\sim 10^{19}$ eV, which may
be incompatible with large magnetic structures around all galaxies for the
UHECR-induced cascade model to work with reasonable jet powers.

relation between the fraction of individuals holding a certain extreme view and
the fraction of individuals that includes also moderates, e.g., in politics,

associated to an abrupt bootstrap-percolation transition with cascades of
extreme views through society. Therefore, it represents an early-warning signal
to forecast the transition from moderate to extreme views. Moreover, by means

and rapidly generate strong MHD turbulence. The total energy is conserved and
the rate of turbulent energy decay is very similar in both codes, although the
fluid code has numerical dissipation whereas the kinetic code has kinetic
dissipation. The inertial range power spectrum index is similar in both the
codes. The fluid code shows a perpendicular wavenumber spectral slope of
$k_{\perp}^{-1.3}$. The kinetic code shows a spectral slope of
$k_{\perp}^{-1.5}$ for smaller simulation domain, and $k_{\perp}^{-1.3}$ for
larger domain. We estimate that collisionless damping mechanisms in the kinetic
code can account for the dissipation of the observed nonlinear energy cascade.
Current sheets are geometrically characterized. Their lengths and widths are in
good agreement between the two codes. The length scales linearly with the
driving scale of the turbulence. In the fluid code, their thickness is
determined by the grid resolution as there is no explicit diffusivity. In the
kinetic code, their thickness is very close to the skin-depth, irrespective of
the grid resolution. This work shows that kinetic codes can reproduce the MHD
inertial range dynamics at large scales, while at the same time capturing
important kinetic physics at small scales.

find a transformation that increases significantly the signal-to-noise ratio on

we achieve a 33% improvement in signal to noise for Gaussianized field in

where the X-ray and optical luminosity dropped and the spectral signatures of

pulsar (MSP), PSR J1227-4853, at a dispersion measure of 43.4 pc cm$^{-3}$

post-transition, the system hosts an active radio MSP. This is the third system
after PSR J1023+0038 and PSR J1824-2452I showing evidence of state switching
between radio MSP and low-mass X-ray binary (LMXB) states. We report timing
observations of PSR J1227-4853 with the GMRT and Parkes, which give a precise
determination of the rotational and orbital parameters of the system. The
companion mass measurement of 0.17 to 0.46 M$_{sun}$ suggests that this is a
redback system. PSR J1227-4853 is eclipsed for about 40% of its orbit at 607
MHz; with additional short-duration eclipses at all orbital phases. We also
find that the pulsar is very energetic, with a spin-down luminosity of ~
10$^{35}$ erg s$^{-1}$. We report simultaneous imaging and timing observations
with the GMRT, which suggests that eclipses are caused by absorption, rather
than dispersion smearing or scattering.

and other settings. A sound theoretical understanding of dropout is needed to
determine when dropout should be applied and how to use it most effectively. In
this paper we continue the exploration of dropout as a regularizer pioneered by
Wager, et.al. We focus on linear classification where a convex proxy to the
misclassification loss (i.e. the logistic loss used in logistic regression) is
minimized. We show: (a) when the dropout-regularized criterion has a unique
minimizer, (b) when the dropout-regularization penalty goes to infinity with
the weights, and when it remains bounded, (c) that the dropout regularization
can be non-monotonic as individual weights increase from 0, and (d) that the
dropout regularization penalty may not be convex. This last point is
particularly surprising because the combination of dropout regularization with
any convex loss proxy is always a convex function.
  In order to contrast dropout regularization with $L_2$ regularization, we
formalize the notion of when different sources are more compatible with
different regularizers. We then exhibit distributions that are provably more
compatible with dropout regularization than $L_2$ regularization, and vice
versa. These sources provide additional insight into how the inductive biases
of dropout and $L_2$ regularization differ. We provide some similar results for
$L_1$ regularization.

relatively rare in the local universe, and their evolutionary paths are
uncertain. We have obtained resolved H I observations of nine $\rm z \sim 0$
luminous compact blue galaxies (LCBGs) using the Giant Metrewave Radio
Telescope and Very Large Array in order to measure their kinematic and
dynamical properties and better constrain their evolutionary possibilities. We
find that the LCBGs in our sample are rotating galaxies that tend to have
nearby companions, relatively high central velocity dispersions, and can have
disturbed velocity fields. We calculate rotation velocities for each galaxy by
measuring half of the velocity gradient along their major axes and correcting
for inclination using axis ratios derived from SDSS images of each galaxy. We
compare our measurements to those previously made with single dishes and find
that single dish measurements tend to overestimate LCBGs' rotation velocities
and H I masses. We also compare the ratio of LCBGs' rotation velocities and
velocity dispersions to those of other types of galaxies and find that LCBGs
are strongly rotationally supported at large radii, similar to other disk
galaxies, though within their half-light radii the $\rm V_{rot}/ \sigma$ values
of their H I are comparable to stellar $\rm V_{rot}/ \sigma$ values of dwarf
elliptical galaxies. We find that LCBGs' disks on average are gravitationally
stable, though conditions may be conducive to local gravitational instabilities
at the largest radii. Such instabilities could lead to the formation of
star-forming gas clumps in the disk, resulting eventually in a small central
bulge or bar.

derive this result by constructing a sequence of canonical transformations to
remove the time-dependence from the original Hamiltonian. When the driving
evolves smoothly in time, the theory can be sharpened by estimating the
probability of adiabatic Landau-Zener transitions at many-body level crossings.
In all cases, we argue that there is delocalization at sufficiently low

the number of citations obtained by any given publication. The effectiveness of
such predictions, however, is fundamentally limited by the power-law
distribution of citations, whereby publications with few citations are
extremely common and publications with many citations are relatively rare.
Given this limitation, in this work we instead address a related question asked

this paper increase my h-index?"" Using a real academic dataset with over 1.7
million authors, 2 million papers, and 8 million citation relationships from
the premier online academic service ArnetMiner, we formalize a novel scientific
impact prediction problem to examine several factors that can drive a paper to
increase the primary author's h-index. We find that the researcher's authority
on the publication topic and the venue in which the paper is published are
crucial factors to the increase of the primary author's h-index, while the
topic popularity and the co-authors' h-indices are of surprisingly little
relevance. By leveraging relevant factors, we find a greater than 87.5%
potential predictability for whether a paper will contribute to an author's
h-index within five years. As a further experiment, we generate a
self-prediction for this paper, estimating that there is a 76% probability that
it will contribute to the h-index of the co-author with the highest current

potential maps to form a minimum-variance (MV) map. The lensing potential is
measured with a signal-to-noise ratio of greater than one for angular
multipoles between $100< L <250$. This is the highest signal-to-noise mass map
made from the CMB to date and will be powerful in cross-correlation with other
tracers of large-scale structure. We calculate the power spectrum of the
lensing potential for each estimator, and we report the value of the MV power
spectrum between $100< L <2000$ as our primary result. We constrain the ratio
of the spectrum to a fiducial $\Lambda$CDM model to be $A_{\rm MV}=0.92 \pm

the dressing method to obtain scattering solutions for dyonic giant magnons

and elementary magnons in terms of the fusion procedure we deduce the
elementary dressing phases. In both the semiclassical and 1-loop cases we find
agreement with recent proposals from finite-gap equations and unitarity cut

determining the resolvent for the dyonic giant magnon from the semiclassical

The Pipe nebula is a molecular cloud that lacks star formation
feedback and has a relatively simple morphology and velocity structure. This
makes it an ideal target to test cloud evolution through collisions. Aims. We
aim at drawing a comprehensive picture of this relatively simple cloud to
better understand the formation and evolution of molecular clouds on large
scales. Methods. We use archival data to compare the optical polarization
properties, the visual extinction, and the 13CO velocities and linewidths of
the entire cloud in order to identify trends among the observables. Results.
The Pipe nebula can be roughly divided in two filaments with different
orientations and gas velocity ranges: E-W at 2-4 km s-1 and N-S at 6-7 km s-1.
The two filaments overlap at the bowl, where the gas shows a velocity gradient
spanning from 2 to 7 km s-1. Compared to the rest of the Pipe nebula, the bowl
gas appears to be denser and exhibits larger linewidths. In addition, the
polarization data at the bowl shows lower angular dispersion and higher
polarization degree. Cores in the bowl tend to cluster in space and tend to
follow the 13CO velocity gradient. In the stem, cores tend to cluster in
regions with properties similar to those of the bowl. Conclusions. The velocity
pattern points to a collision between the filaments in the bowl region. The
magnetic field seems to be compressed and strengthened in the shocked region.
The proportional increase of density and magnetic field strength by a factor
similar to the Alfv\'enic Mach number suggests a continuous shock at low
Alfv\'enic Mach number under flux-freezing. Shocked regions seem to enhance the
formation and clustering of dense cores.

theories with light CP-even (X = s) and CP-odd (X = a) singlet scalars in the

scenarios, such as the Standard Model augmented with a singlet, the
two-Higgs-doublet model with a singlet (2HDM+S) -- which includes the
Next-to-Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (NMSSM) -- and in hidden valley
models. The 2b2mu channel may represent the best discovery avenue for many
models. It has competitive reach, and is less reliant on low-pT b- and
tau-reconstruction compared to other channels like 4b, 4tau, and 2tau2mu. We
analyze the sensitivity of a 2b2mu search for the 8 and 14 TeV LHC, including
the HL-LHC. We consider three types of analyses, employing conventional
resolved b-jets with a clustering radius of R ~ 0.4, thin b-jets with R=0.2,
and jet substructure techniques, respectively. The latter two analyses improve
the reach for m_X ~ 15 GeV, for which the two b-jets are boosted and often
merged. We find that Br(h -> 2X -> 2b2mu) can be constrained at the few x 10^-5
level across the entire considered mass range of X at the HL-LHC. This
corresponds to a 1 - 10% reach in Br(h->2X) in 2HDM+S models, including the
NMSSM, depending on the type of Higgs Yukawa couplings.

of high redshift galaxies. Early, stream-fed, highly perturbed, gas-rich discs
undergo phases of dissipative contraction into compact, star-forming systems
(blue nuggets) at z~4-2. The peak of gas compaction marks the onset of central
gas depletion and inside-out quenching into compact ellipticals (red nuggets)
by z~2. These are sometimes surrounded by gas rings or grow extended dry
stellar envelopes. The compaction occurs at a roughly constant specific
star-formation rate (SFR), and the quenching occurs at a constant stellar
surface density within the inner kpc ($\Sigma_1$). Massive galaxies quench
earlier, faster, and at a higher $\Sigma_1$ than lower-mass galaxies, which
compactify and attempt to quench more than once. This evolution pattern is
consistent with the way galaxies populate the SFR-radius-mass space, and with
gradients and scatter across the main sequence. The compaction is triggered by
an intense inflow episode, involving (mostly minor) mergers, counter-rotating
streams or recycled gas, and is commonly associated with violent disc
instability. The contraction is dissipative, with the inflow rate >SFR, and the
maximum $\Sigma_1$ anti-correlated with the initial spin parameter, as
predicted by Dekel & Burkert (2014). The central quenching is triggered by the
high SFR and stellar/supernova feedback (possibly also AGN feedback) due to the
high central gas density, while the central inflow weakens as the disc
vanishes. Suppression of fresh gas supply by a hot halo allows the long-term
maintenance of quenching once above a threshold halo mass, inducing the
quenching downsizing.

in picosecond polariton lifetime. We demonstrate, theoretically,
above-room-temperature (up to 590 K) BEC of long-lived polaritons in MoSe$_2$
monolayers sandwiched by simple TiO$_2$ based 3D photonic band gap (PBG)

62 meV) for as few as three dichalcogenide monolayers. Strong light-trapping in
the 3D PBG enables the long-lived polariton superfluid to be robust against
fabrication-induced disorder and exciton line-broadening.

interaction. The TNT dwarf pairs span mass ratios of M1/M2 <10, projected
separations <50 kpc, and pair member masses of 7< log(M_*/Msun) <9.7. The
dwarf-dwarf merger sequence, as defined by TNT, demonstrates conclusively and
for the first time that the star formation enhancement observed for massive
galaxy pairs also extends to dwarfs. Star formation is enhanced in paired
dwarfs in otherwise isolated environments by a factor of 2.3 (+/- 0.7) at pair
separations < 50 kpc relative to unpaired analogs. Starbursts, with Ha EQW >100
A, occur in 20% of TNT dwarf pairs, regardless of environment, compared to only
6-8% of matched unpaired dwarfs. Starbursts can be triggered throughout the
merger (out to large pair separations) and not just approaching coalescence.
Despite their enhanced star formation, most TNT dwarf pairs have similar gas
fractions relative to unpaired dwarfs. Thus, there may be significant
reservoirs of diffuse, non-starforming gas surrounding the dwarf pairs or the
gas consumption timescales may be long in the starburst phase. The only TNT
dwarf pairs with low gas fractions (fgas <0.4) and the only dwarfs with Ha EQW
<2 A are found near massive galaxy hosts. Thus, dwarf-dwarf interactions are
significant drivers of dwarf galaxy evolution, but ultimately environment is
responsible for the quenching of star formation. This work is a precursor to an
ongoing high resolution HI and optical imaging program to constrain the spatial
distribution of star formation and gas throughout the dwarf-dwarf merger

We specifically consider CDW order with transferred momenta $(\pm Q,0)$/$(0,\pm

emerge in the spin-fermion model near the onset of antiferromagnetism. We
further argue that the two orders are nearly degenerate due to an approximate
SU(2) particle-hole symmetry of the model. The ${\rm SU}(2)$ symmetry becomes
exact if one neglects the curvature of the Fermi surface in hot regions, in
which case ${\rm U}(1)$ CDW and PDW order parameters become components of an
SO(4)-symmetric PDW/CDW ""super-vector"". We develop a Ginzburg-Landau theory for
PDW/CDW order parameters and find two possible ground states: a ""stripe"" state,
and a ""checkerboard"" state. We show that the ${\rm SO}(4)$ symmetry between CDW
and PDW is broken by two effects. One is the inclusion of Fermi surface
curvature, which selects a PDW order immediately below the instability
temperature. Another is the overlap between different hot regions, which favors
CDW order at low temperatures. For the stripe state, we show that the
competition between the two effects gives rise to a first-order transition from
PDW to CDW inside the ordered state. We also argue that beyond mean-field
theory, the onset temperature for CDW order is additionally enhanced due to
feedback from a preemptive breaking of ${\mathbb Z}_2$ time-reversal symmetry.
We discuss the ground state properties of a pure PDW state and a pure CDW
state, and show that the PDW checkerboard state yields a vortex-anti-vortex
lattice. For the checkerboard state, we considered a situation when both CDW
and PDW orders are present at low $T$ and show that the presence of both

function is completely independent of all couplings. In this case, the

Friedmann universes and reconsider the belief that, after inflation, these
fields decay adiabatically on all scales. Without~abandoning classical
electromagnetism or standard cosmology, we demonstrate that this is not
necessarily the case for superhorizon-sized magnetic fields. The underlying
reason for this is causality, which confines the post-inflationary process of
electric-current formation, electric-field elimination and magnetic-flux
freezing within the horizon. As a result, the adiabatic magnetic decay is not
a~priori guaranteed on super-Hubble scales. Instead, after inflation,
large-scale magnetic fields obey a~power-law solution, where one of the modes
drops at a rate slower than the adiabatic. Whether this slowly decaying mode
can dominate and dictate the post-inflationary magnetic evolution depends on
the initial conditions. These are determined by the evolution of the field
during inflation and by the nature of the transition from the de Sitter phase
to the reheating era and then to the subsequent epochs of radiation and dust.
We discuss two alternative and complementary scenarios to illustrate the role
and the implications of the initial conditions for cosmic magnetogenesis. Our
main claim is that magnetic fields can be superadiabatically amplified after
inflation, as long as they remain outside the horizon. This means that
inflation-produced fields can reach astrophysically relevant residual strengths
without breaking away from standard physics. Moreover, using the same causality
arguments, one can constrain (or in some cases assist) the non-conventional
scenarios of primordial magnetogenesis that amplify their fields during
inflation. Finally, we show that our results extend naturally to the marginally
open and the marginally closed Friedmann universes.

medium towards the end of the hydrogen reionization epoch. This transition
provides a unique opportunity to study the enrichment history of intergalactic
gas and the growth of the ionizing background (UVB) at early times. We study
how carbon absorption evolves from z=10-5 using a cosmological hydrodynamic
simulation that includes a self-consistent multifrequency UVB as well as a
well-constrained model for galactic outflows to disperse metals. Our predicted
UVB is within 2-4 times that of Haardt & Madau (2012), which is fair agreement
given the uncertainties. Nonetheless, we use a calibration in post-processing
to account for Lyman-alpha forest measurements while preserving the predicted
spectral slope and inhomogeneity. The UVB fluctuates spatially in such a way
that it always exceeds the volume average in regions where metals are found.
This implies both that a spatially-uniform UVB is a poor approximation and that
metal absorption is not sensitive to the epoch when HII regions overlap
globally even at column densites of 10^{12} cm^{-2}. We find, consistent with
observations, that the CII mass fraction drops to low redshift while CIV rises
owing the combined effects of a growing UVB and continued addition of carbon in
low-density regions. This is mimicked in absorption statistics, which broadly
agree with observations at z=6-3 while predicting that the absorber column
density distributions rise steeply to the lowest observable columns. Our model
reproduces the large observed scatter in the number of low-ionization absorbers
per sightline, implying that the scatter does not indicate a partially-neutral
Universe at z=6.

spectrally resolved observations of rotational lines of H$_2$O and its
isotopologs with Herschel/HIFI to constrain the physical conditions of the
water emitting region toward the high-mass protostar AFGL2591. We use
analytical estimates and rotation diagrams to estimate T$_{ex}$ and column
densities of H$_2$O of the envelope, the outflow, and a foreground cloud.
Furthermore, we use the non-LTE radiative transfer code to estimate the
temperature and volume density of the H$_2$O emitting gas. Assuming LTE, we
estimate an T$_{ex}$ of 42 K and a column density of 2$\times$10$^{14}$

outflow, in beams of 4"" and 30"", respectively. Non-LTE models indicate a
kinetic temperature of 60-230 K and a volume density of 7$\times$10$^6$-10$^8$
cm$^{-3}$ for the envelope, and a kinetic temperature of 70-90 K and a gas
density of 10$^7$-10$^8$ cm$^{-3}$ for the outflow. The o/p ratio of the
foreground absorption is 1.9$\pm$0.4, suggesting a low temperature. In
contrast, the o/p ratio seen in absorption by the outflow is 3.5$\pm$1.0, as
expected for warm gas. The water abundance in the envelope is 10$^{-9}$,
similar to the low values found for other high- and low-mass protostars,
suggesting that this abundance is constant during the embedded phase of
high-mass star formation. The water abundance in the outflow is 10$^{-10}$,
which is 10$\times$ lower than in the envelope and in the outflows of high- and
low-mass protostars. Since beam size effects can only increase this estimate by
a factor of 2, we suggest that the water in the outflow is affected by
dissociating UV radiation due to the low extinction in the outflow lobe.

of the freeze-out mechanism and the additional production of dark matter states
from the decays of topological defects, in this case cosmic strings. These
decays increase the predicted relic abundance compared to the standard
freeze-out only case, and as a consequence the viable parameter space of the
Inert Doublet Model can be widened substantially. In particular, for a given
dark matter annihilation rate lower dark matter masses become viable. We
investigate the allowed mass range taking into account constraints on the
energy injection rate from the diffuse $\gamma$-ray background and Big Bang
Nucleosynthesis, together with constraints on the dark matter properties coming
from direct and indirect detection limits. For the Inert Doublet Model
high-mass region, an inert Higgs mass as low as $\sim 200$ GeV is permitted.
There is also an upper limit on string mass per unit length, and hence the
symmetry breaking scale, from the relic abundance in this scenario. Depending

renormalizable, non-perturbative approach to QCD. Explicit calculation of
several examples reveals that BRST symmetry breaking apparently afflicts the
unphysical sector of the theory, but may be unbroken where needed, in cases of
physical interest. Specifically, the BRST-exact part of the conserved
energy-momentum tensor and the BRST-exact term in the Kugo-Ojima confinement
condition both have vanishing expectation value. We analyze the origin of the
breaking of BRST symmetry in the GZ model, and obtain a useful sufficient
condition that determines which operators preserve BRST. Observables of the GZ
theory are required to be invariant under a certain group of symmetries that
includes not only BRST but also others. The definition of observables is
thereby sharpened, and excludes all operators known to us that break BRST
invariance. We take as a hypothesis that BRST symmetry is unbroken by this
class of observables. If the hypothesis holds, BRST breaking is relegated to
the unphysical sector of the GZ theory, and its physical states are obtained by
the usual cohomological BRST construction. The fact that the horizon condition
and the Kugo-Ojima confinement criterion coincide assures that color is
confined in the GZ theory.

kinetic effects of the electron and ion distribution functions into the theory.
The underlying assumptions and results of two different approaches are
compared: The conventional `kinetic Bohm criterion' and a fluid-moment
hierarchy approach. The former is based on the asymptotic limit of an
infinitely thin sheath ($\lambda_D/l =0$), whereas the latter is based on a
perturbative expansion of a sheath that is thin compared to the plasma
($\lambda_D/l \ll 1$). Here $\lambda_D$ is the Debye length, which
characterizes the sheath length scale, and $l$ is a measure of the plasma or
presheath length scale. The consequences of these assumptions are discussed in
terms of how they restrict the class of distribution functions to which the
resulting criteria can be applied. Two examples are considered to provide
concrete comparisons between the two approaches. The first is a Tonks-Langmuir
model including a warm ion source [Robertson 2009 \textit{Phys.\ Plasmas} {\bf
16} 103503]. This highlights a substantial difference between the conventional
kinetic theory, which predicts slow ions dominate at the sheath edge, and the
fluid moment approach, which predicts slow ions have little influence. The
second example considers planar electrostatic probes biased near the plasma
potential using model equations and particle-in-cell simulations. This
demonstrates a situation where electron kinetic effects alter the Bohm
criterion, leading to a subsonic ion flow at the sheath edge.

cosmological simulations. We calculate contributions to FRB dispersion measures
(DMs) from the Milky Way, from the local Universe, from cosmological
large-scale structure, and from potential FRB host galaxies, and then compare
these simulations to the DMs of observed FRBs. We find that the Milky Way
contribution has previously been underestimated by a factor of ~2, and that the
foreground-subtracted DMs are consistent with a cosmological origin,
corresponding to a source population observable to a maximum redshift
z~0.6-0.9. We consider models for the spatial distribution of FRBs in which
they are randomly distributed in the Universe, track the star-formation rate of
their host galaxies, track total stellar mass, or require a central
supermassive black hole. Current data do not discriminate between these
possibilities, but the predicted DM distributions for different models will
differ considerably once we begin detecting FRBs at higher DMs and higher
redshifts. We additionally consider the distribution of FRB fluences, and show
that the observations are consistent with FRBs being standard candles, each
burst producing the same radiated isotropic energy. The data imply a constant
isotropic burst energy of ~7e40 erg if FRBs are embedded in host galaxies, or
~9e40 erg if FRBs are randomly distributed. These energies are 10-100 times
larger than had previously been inferred. Within the constraints of the
available small sample of data, our analysis favours FRB mechanisms for which
the isotropic radiated energy has a narrow distribution in excess of 1e40 erg.

of ejecta launched at randomly distributed times and velocities and moving
under constant gravity above the surface of an airless planetary body. Within a
probabilistic framework, closed form solutions are derived for the probability
density functions of the altitude distribution of particles, the distribution
of their speeds in a rest frame both at the surface and at altitude and with
respect to a moving platform such as an orbiting spacecraft. These expressions
are validated against numerically-generated synthetic populations of ejecta
under lunar surface gravity. The model is applied to the cases where the
ejection speed distribution is (a) uniform (b) a power law. For the latter law,
it is found that the effective scale height of the ejecta envelope directly
depends on the exponent of the power law and increases with altitude. The same
holds for the speed distribution of particles near the surface. Ejection model
parameters can, therefore, be constrained through orbital and surface
measurements. The scope of the model is then extended to include
size-dependency of the ejection speed and an example worked through for a
deterministic power law relation. The result suggests that the height
distribution of ejecta is a sensitive proxy for this dependency.

and 2) analysing each light curve (with JKTEBOP) and RVs separately and
combining the partial results at the end. This system also shows a total
primary (deeper) eclipse, lasting for about 6 days. A spectrum obtained during
this eclipse was used to perform atmospheric analysis with the MOOG and SME

  We found that ASAS J195222-3233.7 is a double-lined spectroscopic binary
composed of two evolved, late-type giants, with masses of $M_1 = 1.504\pm0.004$

$P=88.39$ d orbit. Its properties are well reproduced by a 2.38 Gyr isochrone,

conservation of new accidental baryon and lepton numbers. We present an
explicit example by introducing a fourth generation charged under a new

implementations lead to models that contain stable quarks, leptons and

aggregating large datasets in a data analytic stack.While the standard group-by
operator, which is based on equality, is useful in several applications,
allowing similarity aware grouping provides a more realistic view on real-world
data that could lead to better insights. The Similarity SQL-based Group-By
operator (SGB, for short) extends the semantics of the standard SQL Group-by by
grouping data with similar but not necessarily equal values. While existing
similarity-based grouping operators efficiently materialize this approximate
semantics, they primarily focus on one-dimensional attributes and treat
multidimensional attributes independently. However, correlated attributes, such
as in spatial data, are processed independently, and hence, groups in the
multidimensional space are not detected properly. To address this problem, we
introduce two new SGB operators for multidimensional data. The first operator
is the clique (or distance-to-all) SGB, where all the tuples in a group are
within some distance from each other. The second operator is the
distance-to-any SGB, where a tuple belongs to a group if the tuple is within
some distance from any other tuple in the group. We implement and test the new
SGB operators and their algorithms inside PostgreSQL. The overhead introduced
by these operators proves to be minimal and the execution times are comparable
to those of the standard Group-by. The experimental study, based on TPC-H and a
social check-in data, demonstrates that the proposed algorithms can achieve up
to three orders of magnitude enhancement in performance over baseline methods
developed to solve the same problem.

logarithmic planetary radius per logarithmic orbital period at one Earth radius
and one year period, describes the occurrence of Earth-like extrasolar planets.
Here we present a measurement of $\eta_\oplus$ from a parameterised forward
model of the (correlated) period-radius distribution and the observational
selection function in the most recent (Q17) data release from the Kepler
satellite. We find $\eta_\oplus = 3.9_{-1.6}^{+2.2}\%$ (90% CL). We conclude
that each star hosts $3.83_{-0.62}^{+0.76}$ planets with $P \lesssim 3
\mathrm{yr}$ and $R \gtrsim 0.2 R_\oplus$. Our empirical model for
false-positive contamination is consistent with the dominant source being
background eclipsing binary stars. The distribution of planets we infer is
consistent with a highly-stochastic planet formation process producing many
correlated, fractional changes in planet sizes and orbits.

model with several new or up-dated ingredients (atomic and molecular gas
phases, star formation depending on molecular gas, recent sets of
metallicity-dependent stellar yields from H to Ni, observationally inferred
SNIa rates), which reproduces well most global and local observables of the
Milky Way. We obtain abundance profiles flattening both in the inner disk
(because of radial flows) and in the outer disk (because of the adopted star
formation law). The gas abundance profiles flatten with time, but the
corresponding stellar profiles appear to be steeper for younger stars, because
of radial migration. We find a correlation between the stellar abundance
profiles and O/Fe, which is a proxy for stellar age. Our final abundance
profiles are in overall agreement with observations, but slightly steeper (by
0.01-0.02 dex/kpc) for elements above S. We find an interesting ""odd-even
effect"" in the behaviour of the abundance profiles (steeper slopes for odd
elements) for all sets of stellar yields; however, this behaviour does not
appear in observations, suggesting that the effect is, perhaps, overestimated

found that the pressure raises the anisotropy and reduces the coherence length,
resulting in weak interaction of the vortex cores with the pinning centres.
Moreover, the hydrostatic pressure can reduce the density of states [Ns(E)],

  inference on partitioned data","Minor revision",,,,"stat.CO stat.ME stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A common divide-and-conquer approach for Bayesian computation with big data
is to partition the data, perform local inference for each piece separately,
and combine the results to obtain a global posterior approximation. While being
conceptually and computationally appealing, this method involves the
problematic need to also split the prior for the local inferences; these
weakened priors may not provide enough regularization for each separate
computation, thus eliminating one of the key advantages of Bayesian methods. To
resolve this dilemma while still retaining the generalizability of the
underlying local inference method, we apply the idea of expectation propagation
(EP) as a framework for distributed Bayesian inference. The central idea is to
iteratively update approximations to the local likelihoods given the state of
the other approximations and the prior. The present paper has two roles: we
review the steps that are needed to keep EP algorithms numerically stable, and
we suggest a general approach, inspired by EP, for approaching data
partitioning problems in a way that achieves the computational benefits of
parallelism while allowing each local update to make use of relevant
information from the other sites. In addition, we demonstrate how the method
can be applied in a hierarchical context to make use of partitioning of both
data and parameters. The paper describes a general algorithmic framework,

considered. When the target location is searched, the observation is
distributed according to the target distribution, otherwise it is distributed
according to the absence distribution. A universal sequential scheme for search
and stop is proposed using only the knowledge of the absence distribution, and
its asymptotic performance is analyzed. The universal test is shown to yield a
vanishing error probability, and to achieve the optimal reliability when the
target is present, universally for every target distribution. Consequently, it
is established that the knowledge of the target distribution is only useful for
improving the reliability for detecting a missing target. It is also shown that
a multiplicative gain for the search reliability equal to the number of
searched locations is achieved by allowing adaptivity in the search.

attracted considerable interest and been the subject of numerous experimental
searches. These measurements used a variety of reactions and place important
limits on the vector form factors observed in parity-violating (PV) elastic
scattering and the parton distributions determined by deep inelastic scattering
(DIS). In spite of this progress, attempts to relate information obtained from
elastic and DIS experiments have been sparse. To ameliorate this situation, we
develop an interpolating model using light-front wave functions capable of
computing both DIS and elastic observables. This framework is used to show that
existing knowledge of DIS places significant restrictions on our wave
functions. The result is that the predicted effects of nucleon strangeness on
elastic observables are much smaller than those tolerated by direct fits to PV
elastic scattering data alone. Using our model, we find $-0.024 \le \mu_s \le
0.035$, and $-0.137 \le \rho^D_s \le 0.081$ for the strange contributions to
the nucleon magnetic moment and charge radius. The model we develop also
independently predicts the nucleon's strange spin content $\Delta s$ and scalar
density $\langle N| \bar{s}s | N \rangle$, and for these we find agreement with
previous determinations.

ideally flat, the field limit is imposed by the superheating field. On the
surface of cavity, however, nano-defects almost continuously distribute and
suppress the superheating field everywhere. The field limit is imposed by an
effective superheating field given by the product of the superheating field for
ideal flat surface and a suppression factor that contains effects of
nano-defects. A nano-defect is modeled by a triangular groove with a depth
smaller than the penetration depth. An analytical formula for the suppression

the London theory. As an immediate application, the suppression factor of the

decrease in Fourier amplitude parameters and an increase in Fourier phase
parameters with increasing wavelengths at a given period. We also found a
decrease in the skewness and acuteness parameters as a function of wavelength
at a fixed period. We applied a binning method to analyze the progression of
the mean Fourier parameters with period and wavelength. We found that for
periods longer than about 20 days, the values of the Fourier amplitude
parameters increase sharply for shorter wavelengths as compared to wavelengths
longer than the $J$-band. We observed the variation of the Hertzsprung
progression with wavelength. The central period of the Hertzsprung progression
was found to increase with wavelength in the case of the Fourier amplitude
parameters and decrease with increasing wavelength in the case of phase
parameters. We also observed a small variation of the central period of the
progression between the Galaxy and LMC, presumably related to metallicity

spectrum of a distant blazar PKS 1424+240. In this scenario, ultra-high energy
(UHE) protons are assumed to exist in the blazar jet and produce gamma rays
through synchrotron emission emitted by relativistic protons and pair cascades
(resulted from $p\gamma$ interaction); meanwhile, some of these UHE protons may
escape from the jet and are injected into intergalactic space. Therefore, we
assume that UHE cosmic rays (CR) originate from relativistic protons in the jet
and use energy-independent escape timescale to obtain UHECR injection spectrum.
Both contributions of gamma rays injected by the source and secondary gamma
rays produced in interactions of UHECRs emitted by the blazar with photon
background during their propagation through intergalactic space are calculated.
Our results show that this scenario is able to reproduce the GeV-TeV spectrum
of PKS 1424+240 self-consistently in a broad range of redshifts $0.6<z<1.3$.
The required relativistic jet power $L_p\simeq3\times10^{46}\ \rm erg\ s^{-1}$
only moderately depends on the assumed source redshift, while the proton escape
timescale (and the injected UHECR luminosity) strongly depends on $z$. We
compare the integral TeV fluxes predicted in our scenario with the sensitivity
of the planned Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA), and discuss the implications to
future observations.

formulation is still relevant for a large portion of these applications,
because actual time span of these problems can be months or years, during which
discounting factors due to e.g. interest rates are of practical concern. In
this paper, we show that, for such MDPs with discount rate $\alpha$ close to
$1$, under a common ergodicity assumption, a weighted difference between two
successive value function estimates obtained from the classical value iteration

VI. Rigorous error bounds are established which in turn show that the
approximation converges to the actual value function in a rate $(\alpha

discount factor $\alpha \to 1$. Furthermore, we explicitly link the convergence

non-classical correlation than quantum entanglement, because there is a
non-zero quantum discord in several mixed states that could not be measured by
quantum entanglement. But because of optimization part in formulating quantum
discord, it is very difficult and nearly impossible to find quantum discord for
some quantum states. So people proposed geometric quantum discord, which in a
bipartite state could be describe as the distance of the states from the
closest zero-discord state. To understand better geometric quantum discord,
this paper is devoted to compare it with quantum discord and measurement
induced non-locality that is in some sense dual to the geometric quantum
discord. As studying the quantum correlation experimentally is one of the
important thing in quantum information processing, so as our example for
illustrating the difference of geometric quantum discord, quantum discord and

showing that the two approaches give the same transition line. Finally we
determine the geometrical properties of the potential energy landscape, notably
the $T-$and $c-$dependence of the saddle index and use these properties to

  Bi-Directional Pedestrian Movement",,,,,"cs.DC","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","  Pedestrian movement, although ubiquitous and well-studied, is still not that
well understood due to the complicating nature of the embedded social dynamics.
Interest among researchers in simulating pedestrian movement and interactions
has grown significantly in part due to increased computational and
visualization capabilities afforded by high power computing. Different
approaches have been adopted to simulate pedestrian movement under various
circumstances and interactions. In the present work, bi-directional crowd
movement is simulated where an equal numbers of individuals try to reach the
opposite sides of an environment. Two movement methods are considered. First a
Least Effort Model (LEM) is investigated where agents try to take an optimal
path with as minimal changes from their intended path as possible. Following
this, a modified form of Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) is proposed, where
individuals are guided by a goal of reaching the other side in a least effort
mode as well as a pheromone trail left by predecessors. The basic idea is to
increase agent interaction, thereby more closely reflecting a real world
scenario. The methodology utilizes Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) for general
purpose computing using the CUDA platform. Because of the inherent parallel
properties associated with pedestrian movement such as proximate interactions
of individuals on a 2D grid, GPUs are well suited. The main feature of the
implementation undertaken here is that the parallelism is data driven. The data
driven implementation leads to a speedup up to 18x compared to its sequential
counterpart running on a single threaded CPU. The numbers of pedestrians
considered in the model ranged from 2K to 100K representing numbers typical of
mass gathering events. A detailed discussion addresses implementation
challenges faced and averted.

combination of both technologies, with a wind/solar PV energy mix of about
80/20 in a fully renewable scenario. The least cost development is seen to
start with 100% of the technology with the lowest average generation costs
first, but with increasing renewable installations, economically unfavorable
excess generation pushes it toward the minimal backup pathway. Surplus
generation and the entailed costs can be reduced significantly by combining
wind and solar power, and/or absorbing excess generation, for example with
storage or transmission, or by coupling the electricity system to other energy
sectors.

formation using radio interferometry, but still suffer from insufficient
angular resolution. An alternative method to resolve small structures is to
measure the time variability of their emission. Here, we report on gamma-ray
observations of the radio galaxy IC 310 obtained with the MAGIC telescopes
revealing variability with doubling time scales faster than 4.8 min. Causality
constrains the size of the emission region to be smaller than 20\% of the
gravitational radius of its central black hole. We suggest that the emission is
associated with pulsar-like particle acceleration by the electric field across
a magnetospheric gap at the base of the radio jet.

analysis of cosmological N-body data, computer graphics, and continuum

  We focus on the particular case of remeshing tetrahedral cells onto a
Cartesian grid such that the volume integral of the polynomial density function
given on the input mesh is guaranteed to equal the corresponding integral over
the output mesh. We refer to this as ""physically conservative voxelization"".
  At the core of our method is an algorithm for intersecting two convex
polyhedra by successively clipping one against the faces of the other. This
algorithm is an implementation of the ideas presented abstractly by Sugihara
(1994), who suggests using the planar graph representations of convex polyhedra
to ensure topological consistency of the output. This makes our implementation
robust to geometric degeneracy in the input. We employ a simplicial
decomposition to calculate moment integrals up to quadratic order over the
resulting intersection domain.
  We also address practical issues arising in a software implementation,
including numerical stability in geometric calculations, management of
cancellation errors, and extension to two dimensions. In a comparison to recent
work, we show substantial performance gains. We provide a C implementation
intended to be a fast, accurate, and robust tool for geometric calculations on
polyhedral mesh elements.

After identifying the sequence of bifurcations that lead to a spatially and
temporally chaotic regime of the flow when $Re$ and $Rh$ are increased, we
study the transitions between the different turbulent regimes observed for
large $Re$ by varying $Rh$. A large scale circulation at the box size (the
condensate state) is the dominant mode in the limit of vanishing large scale
drag ($Rh$ large). When $Rh$ is decreased, the condensate becomes unstable and
a regime with random reversals between two large scale circulations of opposite
signs is generated. It involves a bimodal probability density function of the
large scale velocity that continuously bifurcates to a Gaussian distribution
when $Rh$ is decreased further.

distinguishing the effect of different spectral components for a set of
consecutive spectra from an X-ray binary. We use well-established linear
methods for the decomposition, namely principal component analysis, independent
component analysis and non-negative matrix factorisation (NMF). Applying these
methods to a simulated dataset consisting of a variable multicolour disc black
body and a cutoff power law, we find that NMF outperforms the other two methods
in distinguishing the spectral components. In addition, due the non-negative
nature of NMF, the resulting components may be fitted separately, revealing the
evolution of individual parameters. To test the NMF method on a real source, we
analyse data from the low-mass X-ray binary GX 339-4 and found the results to
match those of previous studies. In addition, we found the inner radius of the
accretion disc to be located at the innermost stable circular orbit in the
intermediate state right after the outburst peak. This study shows that using
unsupervised spectral decomposition methods results in detecting the separate
component fluxes down to low flux levels. Also, these methods provide an
alternative way of detecting the spectral components without performing actual
spectral fitting, which may prove to be practical when dealing with large

Discovering this ""community structure"" is an important step in studying the
large-scale structure of networks. Many algorithms have been proposed for
community detection and benchmarks have been created to evaluate their
performance. Typically algorithms for community detection either partition the
graph (non-overlapping communities) or find node covers (overlapping
communities).
  In this paper, we propose a particularly simple semi-supervised learning
algorithm for finding out communities. In essence, given the community
information of a small number of ""seed nodes"", the method uses random walks
from the seed nodes to uncover the community information of the whole network.
The algorithm runs in time $O(k \cdot m \cdot \log n)$, where $m$ is the number
of edges; $n$ the number of links; and $k$ the number of communities in the
network. In sparse networks with $m = O(n)$ and a constant number of
communities, this running time is almost linear in the size of the network.
Another important feature of our algorithm is that it can be used for either
non-overlapping or overlapping communities.
  We test our algorithm using the LFR benchmark created by Lancichinetti,
Fortunato, and Radicchi specifically for the purpose of evaluating such
algorithms. Our algorithm can compete with the best of algorithms for both
non-overlapping and overlapping communities as found in the comprehensive study
of Lancichinetti and Fortunato.

rotating very rapidly. Here I show that, if these objects are not the Kerr
black holes of general relativity, the accretion of a small amount of matter

papers in the literature. A graph $G=(V,E)$ is word-representable if there
exists a word $w$ over the alphabet $V$ such that letters $x$ and $y$ alternate
in $w$ if and only if $xy$ is an edge in $E$. If $V =\{1, \ldots, n\}$, this is
equivalent to saying that $G$ is word-representable if for all $x,y \in \{1,
\ldots, n\}$, $xy \in E$ if and only if the subword $w_{\{x,y\}}$ of $w$
consisting of all occurrences of $x$ or $y$ in $w$ has no consecutive
occurrence of the pattern 11.
  In this paper, we introduce the study of $u$-representable graphs for any
word $u \in \{1,2\}^*$. A graph $G$ is $u$-representable if and only if there
is a labeled version of $G$, $G=(\{1, \ldots, n\}, E)$, and a word $w \in \{1,
\ldots, n\}^*$ such that for all $x,y \in \{1, \ldots, n\}$, $xy \in E$ if and
only if $w_{\{x,y\}}$ has no consecutive occurrence of the pattern $u$. Thus,
word-representable graphs are just $11$-representable graphs. We show that for
any $k \geq 3$, every finite graph $G$ is $1^k$-representable. This contrasts
with the fact that not all graphs are 11-representable graphs.
  The main focus of the paper is the study of $12$-representable graphs. In
particular, we classify the $12$-representable trees. We show that any
$12$-representable graph is a comparability graph and the class of
$12$-representable graphs include the classes of co-interval graphs and
permutation graphs. We also state a number of facts on $12$-representation of
induced subgraphs of a grid graph.

codes. In this paper, we construct a Byzantine ro-bust PIR scheme using the
multiplicity codes introduced by Kopparty et al. Our main contributions are on
the one hand to avoid full replica-tion of the database on each server; this
significantly reduces the global redundancy. On the other hand, to have a much
lower locality in the PIR context than in the LDC context. This shows that
there exists two different notions: LDC-locality and PIR-locality. This is made
possible by exploiting geometric properties of multiplicity codes.

glass formation, is remarkably complex. A theoretical explanation of the
dynamics associated with this process has remained one of the major unsolved
problems in condensed matter physics. The Random First Order Transition (RFOT)
theory, which was proposed over twenty five years ago, provides a theoretical
basis for explaining much of the phenomena associated with glass forming
materials. It links or relates multiple metastable states, slow or glassy
dynamics, dynamic heterogeneity, and both a dynamical and an ideal glass
transition. Remarkably, the major concepts in the RFOT theory can also be
profitably used to understand many spectacular phenomena in biology and
condensed matter physics, as we illustrate here. The presence of a large number
of metastable states and the dynamics in such complex landscapes in biological
systems from molecular to cellular scale and beyond leads to behavior, which is
amenable to descriptions based on the RFOT theory. Somewhat surprisingly even
intratumor heterogeneity arising from variations in cancer metastasis in
different cells is hauntingly similar to glassy systems. There are also deep
connections between glass physics and electronically disordered systems
undergoing a metal-insulator transition, aging effects in which quantum effects
play a role, and the physics of super glasses (a phase that is simultaneously a
super fluid and a frozen amorphous structure). We argue that the common aspect
in all these diverse phenomena is that multiple symmetry unrelated states
governing both the equilibrium and dynamical behavior - a lynchpin in the RFOT
theory - controls the behavior observed in these unrelated systems.

had widely spread applications in science and engineering. Material interfaces
are ubiquity in nature and man-made devices, and often give rise to
discontinuous coefficients in the governing elasticity equations. In this work,
the matched interface and boundary (MIB) method is developed to address
elasticity interface problems. Linear elasticity theory for both isotropic
homogeneous and inhomogeneous media is employed. In our approach,
Lam$\acute{e}$'s parameters can have jumps across the interface and are allowed
to be position dependent in modeling isotropic inhomogeneous material. Both
strong discontinuity, i.e., discontinuous solution, and weak discontinuity,
namely, discontinuous derivatives of the solution, are considered in the
present study. In the proposed method, fictitious values are utilized so that
the standard central finite different schemes can be employed regardless of the
interface. Interface jump conditions are enforced on the interface, which in
turn, accurately determines fictitious values. We design new MIB schemes to
account for complex interface geometries. In particular, the cross derivatives
in the elasticity equations are difficult to handle for complex interface
geometries. We propose secondary fictitious values and construct geometry based
interpolation schemes to overcome this difficulty. Numerous analytical examples
are used to validate the accuracy, convergence and robustness of the present
MIB method for elasticity interface problems with both small and large
curvatures, strong and weak discontinuities, and constant and variable
coefficients. Numerical tests indicate second order accuracy in both $L_\infty$

Gemini/GMOS and measured redshifts for 23 and 14 galaxies in the two
structures. These redshifts were combined with those available in the
literature. A dynamical and a weak lensing analysis were also performed,
together with the study of X-ray Chandra archive data. Cluster D3-6 is found to
be a single structure of 8 spectroscopically confirmed members at an average
redshift z=0.607, with a velocity dispersion of 423 km/s. It appears to be a
relatively low mass cluster. D3-43-S3 has 46 spectroscopically confirmed
members at an average redshift z=0.739. It can be decomposed into two main
substructures, having a velocity dispersion of about 600 and 350 km/s. An
explanation to the fact that D3-43-S3 is detected through weak lensing (only
marginally, at the ~3sigma level) but not in X-rays could be that the two
substructures are just beginning to merge more or less along the line of sight.
We also show that D3-6 and D3-43-S3 have similar global galaxy luminosity
functions, stellar mass functions, and star formation rate (SFR) distributions.
The only differences are that D3-6 exhibits a lack of faint early type
galaxies, a deficit of extremely high stellar mass galaxies compared to
D3-43-S3, and an excess of very high SFR galaxies. This study shows the power
of techniques based on photometric redshifts to detect low to moderately
massive structures, even at z~0.75.

transition phenomena, the (discrete size) stochastic Becker-D\""oring, a

Lifshitz-Slyozov model, a nonlinear transport partial differential equation.
For general coefficients and initial data, we introduce a scaling parameter and
prove that the empirical measure associated to the stochastic Becker-D\""oring
system converges in law to the weak solution of the Lifshitz-Slyozov equation
when the parameter goes to 0. Contrary to previous studies, we use a weak
topology that includes the boundary of the state space (\ie\ the size $x=0$)
allowing us to rigorously derive a boundary value for the Lifshitz-Slyozov
model in the case of incoming characteristics. The condition reads $\lim_{x\to
0} (a(x)u(t)-b(x))f(t,x) = \alpha u(t)^2$ where $f$ is the volume distribution
function, solution of the Lifshitz-Slyozov equation, $a$ and $b$ the
aggregation and fragmentation rates, $u$ the concentration of free particles
and $\alpha$ a nucleation constant emerging from the microscopic model. It is
the main novelty of this work and it answers to a question that has been
conjectured or suggested by both mathematicians and physicists. We emphasize
that this boundary value depends on a particular scaling (as opposed to a
modeling choice) and is the result of a separation of time scale and an
averaging of fast (fluctuating) variables.

population dynamics predict a broad range of values of $b$. Here, we explain
this apparent contradiction by using large deviations theory to derive a
generalized TL in terms of sample and populations exponents $b_{jk}$ for the
scaling of the $k$-th vs the $j$-th cumulant (conventional TL is recovered for
$b=b_{12}$), with the sample exponent found to depend predictably on the number

population exponents. Empirical analyses on two datasets support our

high-speed machining. In the simplest case, our method takes a polygon as input
and a number $\delta>0$ and returns a spiral starting at a central point in the
polygon, going around towards the boundary while morphing to the shape of the
polygon. The spiral consists of linear segments and circular arcs, it is $G^1$
continuous, it has no self-intersections, and the distance from each point on
the spiral to each of the neighboring revolutions is at most $\delta$. Our
method has the advantage over previously described methods that it is easily
adjustable to the case where there is an island in the polygon to be avoided by
the spiral. In that case, the spiral starts at the island and morphs the island
to the outer boundary of the polygon. It is shown how to apply that method to
make significantly shorter spirals in polygons with no islands. Finally, we
show how to make a spiral in a polygon with multiple islands by connecting the
islands into one island.

experiments revealed that, in the presence of riboflavin and reduced pyridine

charge-transfer complex of NADP+ and reduced riboflavin. In addition, reduction
of riboflavin was found to be essentially irreversible. Rapid kinetics

minimal kinetic scheme for the reaction of flavin reductase with NADPH and
riboflavin can be proposed. After formation of the Michaelis complex of flavin
reductase with NADPH and riboflavin, a first intermediate, identified as a
charge-transfer complex of NADPH and riboflavin, is formed. It is followed by a
second charge-transfer intermediate of enzyme-bound NADP+ and reduced
riboflavin. The latter decays, yielding the Michaelis complex of flavin
reductase with NADP+ and reduced riboflavin, which then dissociates to complete
the reaction. These results support the initial hypothesis of a structural

source of cosmological information. It is therefore crucial to understand their
behavior. The Effective Field Theory of Large Scale Structures provides a
consistent way to perturbatively predict the clustering of dark matter at large
distances. The fact that baryons move distances comparable to dark matter
allows us to infer that baryons at large distances can be described in a
similar formalism: the backreaction of short-distance non-linearities and of
star-formation physics at long distances can be encapsulated in an effective
stress tensor, characterized by a few parameters. The functional form of
baryonic effects can therefore be predicted. In the power spectrum the leading
contribution goes as $\propto k^2 P(k)$, with $P(k)$ being the linear power
spectrum and with the numerical prefactor depending on the details of the
star-formation physics. We also perform the resummation of the contribution of
the long-wavelength displacements, allowing us to consistently predict the
effect of the relative motion of baryons and dark matter. We compare our
predictions with simulations that contain several implementations of baryonic
physics, finding percent agreement up to relatively high wavenumbers such as
$k\simeq 0.3\,h\, Mpc^{-1}$ or $k\simeq 0.6\, h\, Mpc^{-1}$, depending on the

Surprisingly, almost all discussions in the current literature assume that
hijacking incidents are enabled by the lack of security mechanisms in the
inter-domain routing protocol BGP. In this paper, we discuss an attacker model
that accounts for the hijacking of network ownership information stored in
Regional Internet Registry (RIR) databases. We show that such threats emerge
from abandoned Internet resources (e.g., IP address blocks, AS numbers). When
DNS names expire, attackers gain the opportunity to take resource ownership by
re-registering domain names that are referenced by corresponding RIR database
objects. We argue that this kind of attack is more attractive than conventional
hijacking, since the attacker can act in full anonymity on behalf of a victim.
Despite corresponding incidents have been observed in the past, current
detection techniques are not qualified to deal with these attacks. We show that
they are feasible with very little effort, and analyze the risk potential of
abandoned Internet resources for the European service region: our findings

Anomalous Microwave Emission (AME) with the SKA. AME is thought to be due to
electric dipole radiation from small spinning dust grains, although thermal
fluctuations of magnetic dust grains may also contribute. Studies of this
mysterious component would shed light on the emission mechanism, which then
opens up a new window onto the interstellar medium (ISM). AME is emitted mostly
in the frequency range $\sim 10$--100\,GHz, and thus the SKA has the potential
of measuring the low frequency side of the AME spectrum, particularly in band
5. Science targets include dense molecular clouds in the Milky Way, as well as
extragalactic sources. We also discuss the possibility of detecting rotational
line emission from Poly-cyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs), which could be the
main carriers of AME. Detecting PAH lines of a given spacing would allow for a
definitive identification of specific PAH species.

  Energy-Efficient Computing",,,,,"cs.PL","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Reducing energy consumption is one of the key challenges in computing
technology. One factor that contributes to high energy consumption is that all
parts of the program are considered equally significant for the accuracy of the
end-result. However, in many cases, parts of computations can be performed in
an approximate way, or even dropped, without affecting the quality of the final
output to a significant degree.
  In this paper, we introduce a task-based programming model and runtime system
that exploit this observation to trade off the quality of program outputs for
increased energy-efficiency. This is done in a structured and flexible way,
allowing for easy exploitation of different execution points in the
quality/energy space, without code modifications and without adversely
affecting application performance. The programmer specifies the significance of
tasks, and optionally provides approximations for them. Moreover, she provides
hints to the runtime on the percentage of tasks that should be executed
accurately in order to reach the target quality of results. The runtime system
can apply a number of different policies to decide whether it will execute each
individual less-significant task in its accurate form, or in its approximate
version. Policies differ in terms of their runtime overhead but also the degree
to which they manage to execute tasks according to the programmer's
specification.
  The results from experiments performed on top of an Intel-based
multicore/multiprocessor platform show that, depending on the runtime policy
used, our system can achieve an energy reduction of up to 83% compared with a
fully accurate execution and up to 35% compared with an approximate version
employing loop perforation. At the same time, our approach always results in
graceful quality degradation.

analyzed in detail in this work. Several common used force schemes are utilized
and results compared. Based on the numerical results, the relatively most

spurious velocities on (curved) interfaces. Simulation results show that, the
accuracy of Kupershtokh et al.'s model can be improved with Guo et al.'s force

density ratios are large. To improve the accuracy of the pseudo-potential model

discussed in the present work . Both, a rescaling of the equation of state and

evolution of modified holographic Ricci dark energy's state parameter and the
evolution of dark matter and dark energy's densities shows that the dark energy
holds the dominant position from the near past to the future. By studying the

that this model could explain the Universe's transition from the radiation to
accelerating expansion stage through the dust stage. According to the $Om$

constrained convex optimization problems on a (strongly-)connected multi-agent
network. We assume that each agent has a private objective function and a
constraint set. The proposed DMD algorithm employs a locally designed Bregman
distance function at each agent, and thus can be viewed as a generalization of
the well-known Distributed Projected Subgradient (DPS) methods, which use
identical Euclidean distances at the agents. At each iteration of the DMD, each
agent optimizes its own objective adjusted with the Bregman distance function
while exchanging state information with its neighbors. To further generalize
DMD, we consider the case where the agent communication follows a
\emph{directed} graph and it may not be possible to design doubly-stochastic
weight matrices. In other words, we restrict the corresponding weight matrices
to be row-stochastic instead of doubly-stochastic. We study the convergence of
DMD in two cases: (i) when the constraint sets at the agents are the same; and,
(ii) when the constraint sets at the agents are different. By partially
following the spirit of our proof, it can be shown that a class of
consensus-based distributed optimization algorithms, restricted to
doubly-stochastic matrices, remain convergent with stochastic matrices.

limited to any particular elasticity model or crack propagation regime. Its
basic assumptions are: i) proper choice of independent and dependent variables
(with the direct utilization of a new one - the reduced particle velocity), ii)
tracing the fracture front by use of the speed equation which can be integrated
in a closed form and sets an explicit relation between the crack propagation
speed and the coefficients in the asymptotic expansion of the crack opening,
iii) proper regularization techniques, iv) improved temporal approximation, v)
modular algorithm architecture. The application of the new dependent variable,
the reduced particle velocity, instead of the usual fluid flow rate,
facilitates the computation of the crack propagation speed from the local
relation based on the speed equation. As a result, the position of the crack
front is accurately determined from an explicit formula derived from the speed
equation. The underlying ideas employed in the algorithm are combined together
producing a robust and efficient numerical scheme. Its performance is
demonstrated using classical examples of 1D models for hydraulic fracturing:
PKN and KGD under various fracture propagation regimes. Solution accuracy is
verified against dedicated analytical benchmarks and other solutions available
in the literature. Most of the ideas developed here, can be directly extended
to more general 2D and 3D cases.

has been used by Eckmann, Koch and Wittwer in a computer-assisted proof of
existence of a conservative renormalization fixed point. Furthermore, it has
been shown by Gaidashev, Johnson and Martens that infinitely renormalizable

vanishing Lyapunov exponents on which dynamics for any two maps is smoothly

efficiently exploit spectrum opportunities. A key factor to design a DSA
network is the spectrum sensing algorithms for multiple channels with multiple
users. Multi-user cooperative channel sensing reduces the sensing time, and
thus it increases transmission throughput. However, in a multi-channel system,
the problem becomes more complex since the benefits of assigning users to sense
channels in parallel must also be considered. A sensing schedule, indicating to
each user the channel that it should sense at different sensing moments, must
be thus created to optimize system performance. In this paper, we formulate the
general sensing scheduling optimization problem and then propose several
sensing strategies to schedule the users according to network parameters with
homogeneous sensors. Later on we extend the results to heterogeneous sensors
and propose a robust scheduling design when we have traffic and channel
uncertainty. We propose three sensing strategies, and, within each one of them,
several solutions, striking a balance between throughput performance and
computational complexity, are proposed. In addition, we show that a sequential
channel sensing strategy is the one to be preferred when the sensing time is
small, the number of channels is large, and the number of users is small. For
all the other cases, a parallel channel sensing strategy is recommended in
terms of throughput performance. We also show that a proposed hybrid
sequential-parallel channel sensing strategy achieves the best performance in
all scenarios at the cost of extra memory and computation complexity.

calculation in more general settings. In contrast to the method based on the
Kalman-Yakubovich-Popov lemma, our approach does not require a controllability
assumption, and returns a sinusoidal input that achieves the H infinity norm of
the system including its frequency. In addition, using a semidefinite
programming duality, we present a new proof of the Kalman- Yakubovich-Popov
lemma, and make a connection between strong duality and controllability.
Finally, we generalize our approach towards the generalized
Kalman-Yakubovich-Popov lemma, which considers input signals within a finite
spectrum.

Boltzmann machine. According the results of this study, there emerges a
structure with two sublattices in the interactions, and the nearest-neighbor
and next-nearest-neighbor interactions correspondingly take two discriminative
values, which reflects the individual characteristics of the three sets of
pictures that we process. Meanwhile, in a longer spatial scale, a longer-range,
although still rapidly decaying, ferromagnetic interaction commonly appears in
all cases. The characteristic length scale of the interactions is universally
up to approximately four lattice spacings $\xi \approx 4$. These results are
derived by using the mean-field method, which effectively reduces the
computational time required in a Boltzmann machine. An improved mean-field
method called the Bethe approximation also gives the same results, as well as
the Monte Carlo method does for small size images. These reinforce the validity
of our analysis and findings. Relations to criticality, frustration, and
simple-cell receptive fields are also discussed.

techniques, which is increasingly used in biology and other scientific fields.
Its main benefit is to be applicable to models for which the computation of the
model likelihood is intractable. The basic idea of ABC is to empirically
approximate the model likelihood by using intensive realizations of model runs.
Due to computing time limitations, ABC has thus been mainly applied to models
that are relatively quick to simulate. We here aim at briefly introducing the
field of statistical emulation of computer code outputs and to demonstrate its
potential for ABC applications. Emulation consists in replacing the costly to
simulate model by another (quick to simulate) statistical model called emulator
or meta-model. This emulator is fitted to a small number of outputs of the
original model, and is subsequently used as a surrogate during the inference
procedure. In this contribution, we first detail the principles of model
emulation, with a special reference to the ABC context in which the description
of the stochasticity of model realizations is as important as the description
of the trends linking model parameters and outputs. We then compare several
emulation strategies in an ABC context, using as case study a stochastic
ecological model of community dynamics. We finally describe a novel
emulation-based sequential ABC algorithm which is shown to decrease computing
time by a factor of two on the studied example, compared to previous sequential
ABC algorithms. Routines to perform emulation-based ABC were made available
within the R package EasyABC.

electron acceleration in a plasma. Here, we demonstrate that a plasma wave
generated by a stimulated forward-scattering of an incident laser pulse can be
in the longest acceleration phase with injected relativistic beam electrons.
This is why the plasma wave has the maximum amplification coefficient which is
determined by the acceleration time and the breakdown (overturn) electric field
in which the acceleration of the injected beam electrons occurs. We must note
that for the longest acceleration phase the relativity of the injected beam
electrons plays a crucial role in our scheme. We estimate qualitatively the
acceleration parameters of relativistic electrons in the field of a plasma wave
generated at the stimulated forward-scattering of a high-intensity laser pulse
in a plasma.

designed to investigate the surface thermodynamics of Ising spin glass system
with the aim to study the metastability of supercooled liquids and the ideal
glass transition. The lattice is constructed as a hybrid of partial Husimi
lattice representing the bulk and 1D single bonds representing the surface. The
recursive properties of the lattices were adopted to achieve exact
calculations. The model has an anti-ferromagnetic interaction to give rise to
an ordered phase identified as crystal, and a metastable solution representing
the amorphous/metastable phase. Interactions between particles farther away
than the nearest neighbor distance are taken into consideration. Free energy
and entropy of the ideal crystal and supercooled liquid state of the model on
the surface are calculated by the partial partition function. By analyzing the
free energies and entropies of the crystal and supercooled liquid state, we are
able to identify the melting transition and the second order ideal glass
transition on the surface. The results show that due to the coordination number
change, the transition temperature on the surface decreases significantly
compared to the bulk system. Our calculation agrees with experimental and
simulation results on the thermodynamics of surfaces and thin films conducted
by others.
