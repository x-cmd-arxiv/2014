consisting of two families of conics. Patches of supercyclides can be adapted
to a Q-net (a discrete quadrilateral net with planar faces) such that
neighboring surface patches share tangent planes along common boundary curves.
We call the resulting patchworks 'supercyclidic nets' and show that every Q-net
in $\mathbb{R}P^3$ can be extended to a supercyclidic net. The construction is
governed by a multidimensionally consistent 3D system. One essential aspect of
the theory is the extension of a given Q-net in $\mathbb{R}P^N$ to a system of
circumscribed discrete torsal line systems. We present a description of the
latter in terms of projective reflections that generalizes the systems of
orthogonal reflections which govern the extension of circular nets to cyclidic

non-normal nonlinear system that not only highlights the phenomena of linear
transient growth, subcritical transition and global modes, but is also of
potential interest in its own right in the field of nonlinear optics. The
second is the fairly familiar inhomogeneous nonlinear complex Ginzburg--Landau
(CGL) equation. The two-level model is exactly solvable for the nonlinear
global mode and its stability, while for the spatially-extended CGL equation,
perturbative solutions for the global mode and its stability are presented,
valid for inhomogeneities with arbitrary scales of spatial variation and global
modes of small amplitude, corresponding to a scenario near criticality. For
other scenarios, a numerical iterative nonlinear eigenvalue technique is
preferred. Two global modes of different amplitudes are revealed in the
numerical approach. For both the two-level system and the nonlinear CGL
equation, the analytical calculations are supplemented with direct numerical
simulation, thus showing the fate of unstable global modes. For the two-level
model this results in unbounded growth of the full nonlinear equations. For the
spatially-extended CGL model in the subcritical regime, the global mode of
larger amplitude exhibits a `one-sided' instability leading to a chaotic
dynamics, while the global mode of smaller amplitude is always unstable (theory
confirms this). However, advection can stabilize the mode of larger amplitude.

extended source images which we term adaptive semi-linear inversion (SLI). At
the heart of the method is an h-means clustering algorithm which is used to
derive a source plane pixelization that adapts to the lens model magnification.
The distinguishing feature of adaptive SLI is that every pixelization is
derived from a random initialization, ensuring that data discretization is
performed in a completely different and unique way for every lens model
parameter set. We compare standard SLI on a fixed source pixel grid with the
new method and demonstrate the shortcomings of the former when modeling
singular power law ellipsoid (SPLE) lens profiles. In particular, we
demonstrate the superior reliability and efficiency of adaptive SLI which, by
design, fixes the number of degrees of freedom (NDOF) of the optimization and
thereby removes biases present with other methods that allow the NDOF to vary.
In addition, we highlight the importance of data discretization in pixel-based
inversion methods, showing that adaptive SLI averages over significant
systematics that are present when a fixed source pixel grid is used. In the
case of the SPLE lens profile, we show how the method successfully samples its
highly degenerate posterior probability distribution function with a single
non-linear search. The robustness of adaptive SLI provides a firm foundation
for the development of a strong lens modeling pipeline, which will become
necessary in the short-term future to cope with the increasing rate of
discovery of new strong lens systems.

approach partitions state space into pairs of coherent sets, which are sets of
initial conditions chosen to minimize the number of trajectories that ""leak""
from one set to the other under the influence of a stochastic flow field during
a pre-specified interval in time. In practice, this partition is computed by
posing an optimization problem, which once solved, yields a pair of functions
whose signs determine set membership. From prior experience with synthetic,
""data rich"" test problems and conceptually related methods based on
approximations of the Perron-Frobenius operator, we observe that the functions
of interest typically appear to be smooth. As a result, given a fixed amount of
data our approach, which can use sets of globally supported basis functions,
has the potential to more accurately approximate the desired functions than
other functions tailored to use compactly supported indicator functions. This
difference enables our approach to produce effective approximations of pairs of
coherent sets in problems with relatively limited quantities of Lagrangian
data, which is usually the case with real geophysical data. We apply this
method to three examples of increasing complexity: the first is the double

censored client and entry point to the uncensored network is a frequent target
of censorship due to the ease with which a nation-state censor can control it.
A number of censorship resistance systems have been developed thus far to help
circumvent blocking on this link, which we refer to as link circumvention
systems (LCs). The variety and profusion of attack vectors available to a
censor has led to an arms race, leading to a dramatic speed of evolution of
LCs. Despite their inherent complexity and the breadth of work in this area,
there is no systematic way to evaluate link circumvention systems and compare
them against each other. In this paper, we (i) sketch an attack model to
comprehensively explore a censor's capabilities, (ii) present an abstract model
of a LC, a system that helps a censored client communicate with a server over
the Internet while resisting censorship, (iii) describe an evaluation stack
that underscores a layered approach to evaluate LCs, and (iv) systemize and
evaluate existing censorship resistance systems that provide link
circumvention. We highlight open challenges in the evaluation and development

nonlinearity consisting of a two-level system (qubit) interacting with a single
mode cavity, which is coupled to two waveguides, each containing a single
incident photon wave packet initially. In this scattering setup, we study the
interplay between the Hong-Ou-Mandel effect arising due to quantum interference
and effective photon-photon interactions induced by the presence of the qubit.
We calculate the two-photon scattering matrix of this system analytically and
identify signatures of interference and interaction in the second order auto-
and cross-correlation functions of the scattered photons. In the dispersive
regime, when qubit and cavity are far detuned from each other, we find that the
JC nonlinearity can be used as an almost linear, in-situ tunable beam splitter
giving rise to ideal Hong-Ou-Mandel interference, generating a highly
path-entangled two-photon NOON state of the scattered photons. The latter
manifests itself in strongly suppressed waveguide cross-correlations and
Poissonian photon number statistics in each waveguide. If the two-level system
and the cavity are on resonance, the JC nonlinearity strongly modifies the
ideal HOM conditions leading to a smaller degree of path entanglement and
sub-poissonian photon number statistics. In the latter regime, we find that
photon blockade is associated with bunched auto-correlations in both
waveguides, while a two-polariton resonance can lead to bunched as well as
anti-bunched correlations.

Preconditioning by the single-inclusion scattering matrix, this is solved
iteratively in $O(M)$ time using a fast matrix-vector product. Numerical

important open problems in astrophysics. Despite a big experimental effort done
in the past years, the sources of these very energetic particles remain
unidentified. Therefore, their distribution on the Universe and even their
space density are still unknown. It has been shown that different spatial
configurations of the sources lead to different energy spectra and composition
profiles (in the case of sources injecting heavy nuclei) at Earth. These
ensemble fluctuations are more important at the highest energies because only
nearby sources, which are necessarily few, can contribute to the flux observed
at Earth. This is due to the interaction of the cosmic rays with the low energy
photons of the radiation field, present in the intergalactic medium, during
propagation. It is believed that the intergalactic medium is permeated by a
turbulent magnetic field. Although at present it is still unknown, there are
several constraints for its intensity and coherence length obtained from
different observational techniques. Charged cosmic rays are affected by the
intergalactic magnetic field because of the bending of their trajectories
during propagation through the intergalactic medium. In this work, the
influence of the intergalactic magnetic field on the ensemble fluctuations is
studied. Sources injecting only protons and only iron nuclei are considered.
The ensemble fluctuations are studied for different values of the density of
sources compatible with the constraints recently obtained from cosmic ray data.
Also, the possible detection of the ensemble fluctuations in the context of the

biology of living cells, whose interior is characterised by a high degree of
molecular crowding. We here investigate in detail the looping dynamics of
flexible polymer chains in the presence of different degrees of crowding. From
the analysis of the looping-unlooping rates and the looping probabilities of
the chain ends we show that the presence of small crowders typically slow down
the chain dynamics but larger crowders may in fact facilitate the looping. We
rationalise these non-trivial and often counterintuitive effects of the crowder
size onto the looping kinetics in terms of an effective solution viscosity and
standard excluded volume effects. Thus for small crowders the effect of an
increased viscosity dominates, while for big crowders we argue that confinement
effects (caging) prevail. The tradeoff between both trends can thus result in
the impediment or facilitation of polymer looping, depending on the crowder
size. We also examine how the crowding volume fraction, chain length, and the
attraction strength of the contact groups of the polymer chain affect the
looping kinetics and hairpin formation dynamics. Our results are relevant for
DNA looping in the absence and presence of protein mediation, DNA hairpin
formation, RNA folding, and the folding of polypeptide chains under

In contrast, in CNTs of the zigzag class it does not occur. These two

between a lattice of excluded volume, immobile non-inert obstacles. In
particular, we analyse how the strength of the tracer-obstacle interactions and
the volume occupancy of the crowders alter the diffusive motion of the tracer.
From the details of the partitioning of the tracer diffusion modes between
trapping states when bound to obstacles and bulk diffusion, we examine the
degree of localisation of the tracer in the lattice of crowders. We study the
properties of the tracer diffusion in terms of the ensemble and time averaged
mean squared displacements, the trapping time distributions, the amplitude
variation of the time averaged mean squared displacements, and the
non-Gaussianity parameter of the diffusing tracer. We conclude that
tracer-obstacle adsorption and binding triggers a transient anomalous
diffusion. From a very narrow spread of recorded individual time averaged
trajectories we exclude continuous type random walk processes as the underlying
physical model of the tracer diffusion in our system. For moderate
tracer-crowder attraction the motion is found to be fully ergodic, while at
stronger attraction strength a transient disparity between ensemble and time
averaged mean squared displacements occurs. We also put our results into
perspective with findings from experimental single-particle tracking and
simulations of the diffusion of tagged tracers in dense crowded suspensions.

abstract method for deriving decay estimates on the semigroup associated to

method so as to consider the shrinkage of the functional space. Roughly
speaking, we consider a class of operators writing as a dissipative part plus a
mild perturbation, and we prove that if the associated semigroup satisfies a
decay estimate in some reference space then it satisfies the same decay
estimate in another-smaller or larger-Banach space under the condition that a
certain iterate of the ""mild perturba- tion"" part of the operator combined with
the dissipative part of the semigroup maps the larger space to the smaller
space in a bounded way. The cornerstone of our approach is a factorization
argument, reminiscent of the Dyson series.(2) We apply this method to the
kinetic Fokker-Planck equation when the spatial domain is either the torus with
periodic boundary conditions, or the whole space with a confinement potential.

encompassing various classic and recent MTL/MDL algorithms by interpreting them
as different ways of constructing semantic descriptors. Our interpretation
provides an alternative pipeline for zero-shot learning (ZSL), where a model
for a novel class can be constructed without training data. Moreover, it leads
to a new and practically relevant problem setting of zero-shot domain

and gravitational losses, the contact discontinuity of each bubble is now
expanding only very slowly. We find observational signatures in both
hemispheres of giant, reverse shocks at heights of ~ 1 kpc above the nucleus;
their presence ultimately explains all three of the non-thermal phenomena
mentioned above. Synchrotron emission from shock-reaccelerated cosmic-ray
electrons explains the spectrum, morphology, and vertical extent of the
microwave Haze and the polarized radio Lobes. Collisions between
shock-reaccelerated hadrons and denser gas in cooling condensations that form
inside the contact discontinuity account for most of the Bubbles' \gamma-ray
emissivity.

the vacuum conformal block is computed by a bulk Wilson line probing an
asymptotically AdS$_3$ background with higher spin fields excited, the latter
emerging as the effective bulk description of the excited state produced by the
heavy operators. Among other things, this puts a previous proposal for
computing higher spin entanglement entropy via Wilson lines on firmer footing,

arcminute scales. Measurements of this effect can be used to constrain the
masses of galaxy clusters with CMB data alone. Here we present a measurement of
lensing of the CMB by galaxy clusters using data from the South Pole Telescope
(SPT). We develop a maximum likelihood approach to extract the CMB cluster
lensing signal and validate the method on mock data. We quantify the effects on
our analysis of several potential sources of systematic error and find that
they generally act to reduce the best-fit cluster mass. It is estimated that
this bias to lower cluster mass is roughly $0.85\sigma$ in units of the
statistical error bar, although this estimate should be viewed as an upper
limit. We apply our maximum likelihood technique to 513 clusters selected via
their SZ signatures in SPT data, and rule out the null hypothesis of no lensing
at $3.1\sigma$. The lensing-derived mass estimate for the full cluster sample
is consistent with that inferred from the SZ flux: $M_{200,\mathrm{lens}} =

less then ideal number of labelled samples for brain decoding tasks (predicting

neural network architecture with spatial pooling for brain decoding which aims
to reduce dimensionality of feature space along with improved classification
performance. Temporal representations (filters) for each layer of the
convolutional model are learned by leveraging unlabelled fMRI data in an
unsupervised fashion with regularized autoencoders. Learned temporal
representations in multiple levels capture the regularities in the temporal
domain and are observed to be a rich bank of activation patterns which also
exhibit similarities to the actual hemodynamic responses. Further, spatial
pooling layers in the convolutional architecture reduce the dimensionality
without losing excessive information. By employing the proposed temporal
convolutional architecture with spatial pooling, raw input fMRI data is mapped
to a non-linear, highly-expressive and low-dimensional feature space where the
final classification is conducted. In addition, we propose a simple heuristic
approach for hyper-parameter tuning when no validation data is available.
Proposed method is tested on a ten class recognition memory experiment with
nine subjects. The results support the efficiency and potential of the proposed
model, compared to the baseline multi-voxel pattern analysis techniques.

but it relies on infinitesimal effects (partial derivatives) in order to
perform credit assignment. This could become a serious issue as one considers
deeper and more non-linear functions, e.g., consider the extreme case of
nonlinearity where the relation between parameters and cost is actually
discrete. Inspired by the biological implausibility of back-propagation, a few
approaches have been proposed in the past that could play a similar credit
assignment role. In this spirit, we explore a novel approach to credit
assignment in deep networks that we call target propagation. The main idea is
to compute targets rather than gradients, at each layer. Like gradients, they
are propagated backwards. In a way that is related but different from
previously proposed proxies for back-propagation which rely on a backwards
network with symmetric weights, target propagation relies on auto-encoders at
each layer. Unlike back-propagation, it can be applied even when units exchange
stochastic bits rather than real numbers. We show that a linear correction for
the imperfectness of the auto-encoders, called difference target propagation,
is very effective to make target propagation actually work, leading to results
comparable to back-propagation for deep networks with discrete and continuous
units and denoising auto-encoders and achieving state of the art for stochastic
networks.

multi-intensional programming system that delivers as a framework for compiling
and executing programs written in Lucid Programming Languages. DMARF
(Distributed Modular Audio Recognition Framework) is a Java based research
platform that acts as a library in applications. As these systems are in their
evolving phase and a lot of research is being done upon these topics, it gives
us motivation to be a part of this research to get a deeper look into the

the two open source systems, we have used a tool namely Logiscope. It is a tool
to automate the code reviews by providing information based on software metrics

illustrate the conceptual architecture of these case studies, for this we have
referenced the original architecture to draw the important candidate concepts

introducing refactoring methods onto the smells which have been identified and
possibly refactor them accordingly by applying appropriate refactoring methods

searched for transients with dispersion measures from 0 to 3000 pc/cm3. No
transients were detected in observations of high Galactic latitude fields taken
from September 2013 though October 2014. Observations of a known pulsar show
that images typically had a thermal-noise limited sensitivity of 120 mJy/beam
(8 sigma; Stokes I) in 5 ms and could detect and localize transients over a
wide field of view. Our nondetection limits the FRB rate to less than
7e4/sky/day (95% confidence) above a fluence limit of 1.2 Jy-ms. Assuming a
Euclidean flux distribution, the VLA rate limit is inconsistent with the
published rate of Thornton et al. We recalculate previously published rates
with a homogeneous consideration of the effects of primary beam attenuation,
dispersion, pulse width, and sky brightness. This revises the FRB rate downward
and shows that the VLA observations had a roughly 60% chance of detecting a
typical FRB and that a 95% confidence constraint would require roughly 500
hours of similar VLA observing. Our survey also limits the repetition rate of
an FRB to 2 times less than any known repeating millisecond radio transient.

surrounding the AGB star U Hya in archival observations performed by the Galaxy
Evolution Explorer (GALEX). This is the third discovery of extended UV emission
from a carbon AGB star and the first from an AGB star with a detached shell.
From imaging and photometric analysis of the FUV and NUV images, we determined
that the ultraviolet ring has a radius of $\sim 110^{\prime\prime}$, thus
indicating that the emitting material is likely associated with the detached
shell seen in the infrared. We find that scattering of the central point source
of NUV and FUV emission by the dust shell is negligible. Moreover, we find that
scattering of the interstellar radiation field by the dust shell can contribute
at most $\sim10%$ of the FUV flux. Morphological and photometric evidence
suggests that shocks caused by the star's motion through space and, possibly,
shock-excited H$_2$ molecules are the most likely origins of the UV flux. In
contrast to previous examples of extended UV emission from AGB stars, the
extended UV emission from U Hya does not show a bow shock-like structure, which
is consistent with a lower space velocity and lower interstellar medium
density. This suggests the detached dust shell is the source of the UV emitting
material and can be used to better understand the formation of detached shells.

and abundance analyses from high-resolution spectroscopy allow us to identify
chemically peculiar stars, in which the absence of pulsations is not
surprising. The remaining stars are chemically normal, yet they are not
$\delta$ Sct stars. Their lack of observed p modes cannot be explained through
any known mechanism. However, they are mostly distributed around the edges of
the $\delta$ Sct instability strip, which allows for the possibility that they
actually lie outside the strip once the uncertainties are taken into account.
We investigated the possibility that the non-pulsators inside the instability
strip could be unresolved binary systems, having components that both lie
outside the instability strip. If misinterpreted as single stars, we found that
such binaries could generate temperature discrepancies of $\sim$300 K -- larger
than the spectroscopic uncertainties, and fully consistent with the
observations. After these considerations, there remains one chemically normal
non-pulsator that lies in the middle of the instability strip. This star is a
challenge to pulsation theory. However, its existence as the only known star of
its kind indicates that such stars are rare. We conclude that the $\delta$ Sct
instability strip is pure, unless pulsation is shut down by diffusion or
another mechanism, which could be interaction with a binary companion.

significant isotropic emission across multiple frequencies spanning from 22 MHz

exceeds the expected contribution from known astrophysical sources.
Interestingly, models have indicated that the annihilation of dark matter
particles may reproduce both the flux and spectrum of the excess. However, the
lack of a measurable anisotropy in the residual emission remains challenging
for both dark matter and standard astrophysical interpretations of the ARCADE-2
data. We calculate the expected synchrotron anisotropy from dark matter
annihilation and show that these models can produce very small anisotropies,
though this requires galaxy clusters to have large substructure contributions
and strong magnetic fields. We show that this constraint can be significantly
relaxed, however, in scenarios where electrons produced via dark matter
annihilation can be efficiently reaccelerated by Alfv\'en waves in the
intra-Cluster medium. Our analysis indicates that any source capable of
explaining the intensity and isotropy of the extragalactic radio excess must
have a spatial extension far larger than typical for baryons in galaxies,

SL(2,C) Chern-Simons theory on $S^3$. In particular we analyze its asymptotic
behaviour in the double-scaling limit in which both the representation labels
and the Chern-Simons coupling are taken to be large, but with fixed ratio. When
the Wilson graph operator has a specific form, motivated by loop quantum
gravity, the critical point equations obtained in this double-scaling limit
describe a very specific class of flat connection on the graph complement
manifold. We find that flat connections in this class are in correspondence
with the geometries of constant curvature 4-simplices. The result is fully
non-perturbative from the perspective of the reconstructed geometry. We also
show that the asymptotic behavior of the amplitude contains at the leading
order an oscillatory part proportional to the Regge action for the single
4-simplex in the presence of a cosmological constant. In particular, the
cosmological term contains the full-fledged curved volume of the 4-simplex.
Interestingly, the volume term stems from the asymptotics of the Chern-Simons
action. This can be understood as arising from the relation between
Chern-Simons theory on the boundary of a region, and a theory defined by an
$F^2$ action in the bulk. Another peculiarity of our approach is that the sign
of the curvature of the reconstructed geometry, and hence of the cosmological
constant in the Regge action, is not fixed a priori, but rather emerges
semiclassically and dynamically from the solution of the equations of motion.
In other words, this work suggests a relation between 4-dimensional loop
quantum gravity with a cosmological constant and SL(2,C) Chern-Simons theory in
3-dimensions with knotted graph defects.

  systems",,,"10.1016/j.jsc.2015.12.001",,"cs.SC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Solving polynomial systems arising from applications is frequently made
easier by the structure of the systems. Weighted homogeneity (or
quasi-homogeneity) is one example of such a structure: given a system of
weights $W=(w\_{1},\dots,w\_{n})$, $W$-homogeneous polynomials are polynomials
which are homogeneous w.r.t the weighted degree
$\deg\_{W}(X\_{1}^{\alpha\_{1}},\dots,X\_{n}^{\alpha\_{n}}) = \sum
w\_{i}\alpha\_{i}$. Gr\""obner bases for weighted homogeneous systems can be
computed by adapting existing algorithms for homogeneous systems to the
weighted homogeneous case. We show that in this case, the complexity estimate
for Algorithm~\F5 $\left(\binom{n+\dmax-1}{\dmax}^{\omega}\right)$ can be
divided by a factor $\left(\prod w\_{i} \right)^{\omega}$. For zero-dimensional
systems, the complexity of Algorithm~\FGLM $nD^{\omega}$ (where $D$ is the
number of solutions of the system) can be divided by the same factor
$\left(\prod w\_{i} \right)^{\omega}$. Under genericity assumptions, for
zero-dimensional weighted homogeneous systems of $W$-degree
$(d\_{1},\dots,d\_{n})$, these complexity estimates are polynomial in the
weighted B\'ezout bound $\prod\_{i=1}^{n}d\_{i} / \prod\_{i=1}^{n}w\_{i}$.
Furthermore, the maximum degree reached in a run of Algorithm \F5 is bounded by
the weighted Macaulay bound $\sum (d\_{i}-w\_{i}) + w\_{n}$, and this bound is
sharp if we can order the weights so that $w\_{n}=1$. For overdetermined
semi-regular systems, estimates from the homogeneous case can be adapted to the

Soudry in [GRS11], the structure of Fourier coefficients of the residual
representations of certain special Eisenstein series plays important roles.
Started from [JLZ13], the authors are looking for more general residual
representations, which may yield more general theory of automorphic descents.
In this paper, we investigate the structure of Fourier coefficients of certain
residual representations of symplectic groups, corresponding to certain
interesting families of global Arthur parameters. On one hand, the results
partially confirm a conjecture proposed by the first named author in [J14] on
relations between the global Arthur parameters and the structure of Fourier
coefficients of the automorphic representations in the corresponding global
Arthur packets. On the other hand, the results of this paper can be regarded as
a first step towards more general automorphic descents for symplectic groups,
which will be considered in our future work.

fact, at first, great scientists like Von Neumann, London, Bauer and Wigner

yet very controversial. In fact, there are many challenging discussions about
the survival of quantum effects in microscopic structures of the human brain,
which is mainly because of quick decoherence of quantum states due to hot, wet
and noisy environment of the brain that forbids long life coherence for brain
processing. Nevertheless, there are also several arguments and evidences that
emergence of large coherent states is feasible in the brain. In this paper, our
approach is based on the latter in which macroscopic quantum states are
probable in the human brain. Here, we simulate the delayed luminescence of
photons in neurons with a Brassard-like teleportation circuit, i.e. equivalent
to the transfer of quantum states of photons through the visual pathways from
retina to the visual cortex. Indeed, our simulation considers both classical
and quantum mechanical aspects of processing in neurons. As a result and based
on our simulation, it is possible for our brain to receive the exact quantum

the results to be statistically significant up to a commonly accepted level

loss law, and number of transmit (Tx) antennas. Important insights arising from
our analysis for typical HetNets are for instance: (i) IA-MRC becomes less
favorable than IB-MRC with Tx diversity due to the smaller interference
variance and increased interference correlation across Rx antennas; (ii)
ignoring spatial interference correlation significantly overestimates the
performance of IA-MRC; (iii) for small number of Rx antennas, selection
combining may offer a better complexity-performance trade-off than MRC.

focus on the non-equilibrium transfer of angular momentum to the magnetization
from a spin-polarised current of electrons, a technique which is widely used in
the context of spintronics to manipulate magnetic moments. We unveil two hidden
dynamical symmetries of the generating functionals of these Markovian
multiplicative white-noise processes. One symmetry only holds in equilibrium
and we use it to prove generic relations such as the fluctuation-dissipation
theorems. Out of equilibrium, we take profit of the symmetry-breaking terms to
prove fluctuation theorems. The other symmetry yields strong dynamical
relations between correlation and response functions which can notably simplify
the numerical analysis of these problems. Our construction allows us to clarify
some misconceptions on multiplicative white-noise stochastic processes that can
be found in the literature. In particular, we show that a first-order
differential equation with multiplicative white noise can be transformed into
an additive-noise equation, but that the latter keeps a non-trivial memory of

interval is within the light-cone emanating from the contact point. In this
steady state, the exact expressions for the entanglement entropy and the
logarithmic negativity are in agreement with the steady state density matrix
being a boosted thermal state, as expected. We derive various general
identities: relating the negativity after the quench with unequal left and
right initial temperatures, with that with equal left and right temperatures;
and relating these with the negativity in equilibrium thermal states. In
certain regimes the resulting expressions can be analytically evaluated.
Immediately after the interval interesects the lightcone, we find logarithmic
growth. For a very long interval, we find that the negativity approaches a
plateau after sufficiently long times, different from its NESS value. This
provides a theoretical framework explaining recently obtained numerical

use the SimpleX algorithm to post-process 3D smoothed particle hydrodynamics
simulation output of the interacting winds in Eta Car in order to obtain the
fractions of ionized helium assuming three different primary star mass-loss
rates. The resultant ionization maps constrain the regions where helium is
singly- and doubly-ionized. We find that reducing the primary's mass-loss rate
increases the volume of He+. Lowering the primary mass-loss rate produces large
variations in the volume of He+ in the pre-shock primary wind on the periastron
side of the system. Our results show that binary orientations in which apastron
is on our side of the system are more consistent with available observations.
We suggest that small variations in the primary's mass-loss rate might explain
the observed increase in HeI absorption in recent decades, although numerous
questions regarding this scenario remain open. We also propose that the absence
of broad HeI lines in the spectra of Eta Car between its 1890's eruption and
1944 might be explained by the companion star's He0+ ionizing photons not being
able to penetrate the wind-wind interaction region, due to a higher primary
mass-loss rate at that time (by a factor >2, compared to the present value).

provide a better prior for gradient distributions in real images. They are
based on using concave energies $\phi$ in the total variation type functional
${TV}^\phi(u) := \int \phi(|\nabla u(x)|) d x$. In this paper, it is
demonstrated that for typical choices of $\phi$, functionals of this type pose
several difficulties when extended to the entire space of functions of bounded
variation, ${BV}(\Omega)$. In particular, if $\phi(t)=t^q$ for $q \in (0, 1)$
and ${TV}^\phi$ is defined directly for piecewise constant functions and
extended via weak* lower semicontinuous envelopes to ${BV}(\Omega)$, then still
${TV}^\phi(u)=\infty$ for $u$ not piecewise constant. If, on the other hand,
${TV}^\phi$ is defined analogously via continuously differentiable functions,
then ${TV}^\phi \equiv 0$, (!). We study a way to remedy the models through
additional multiscale regularisation and area strict convergence, provided that
the energy $\phi(t)=t^q$ is linearised for high values. The fact, that this
kind of energies actually better matches reality and improves reconstructions,
is demonstrated by statistics and numerical experiments.

scattering surfaces. Such faster-than-light speeds are well-known phenomena
that do not violate special relativity. It is shown here that under certain
circumstances, superluminal spot pair creation and annihilation events can
occur that provide unique information to observers. These spot pair events are
{\it not} particle pair events -- they are the sudden creation or annihilation
of a pair of relatively illuminated spots on a scattering surface. Real spot
pair illumination events occur unambiguously on the scattering surface when
spot speeds diverge, while virtual spot pair events are observer dependent and
perceived only when real spot radial speeds cross the speed of light.
Specifically, a virtual spot pair creation event will be observed when a real
spot's speed toward the observer drops below $c$, while a virtual spot pair
annihilation event will be observed when a real spot's radial speed away from
the observer rises above $c$. Superluminal spot pair events might be found
angularly, photometrically, or polarimetrically, and might carry useful
geometry or distance information. Two example scenarios are briefly considered.
The first is a beam swept across a scattering spherical object, exemplified by
spots of light moving across Earth's Moon and pulsar companions. The second is
a beam swept across a scattering planar wall or linear filament, exemplified by
spots of light moving across variable nebulae including Hubble's Variable
Nebula. In local cases where the sweeping beam can be controlled and repeated,
a three-dimensional map of a target object can be constructed. Used
tomographically, this imaging technique is fundamentally different from lens
photography, radar, and conventional lidar.

environments conducive for the formation of water and/or ammonia clouds, like
Jupiter in the Solar System. We study the science return from direct-imaging
exoplanet missions, focusing on the exoplanet atmospheric compositions. First,
the study shows that a low-resolution (R=70) reflection spectrum of a giant
exoplanet at 600 - 1000 nm, for a moderate signal-to-noise ratio of 20, will
allow measurements of both the pressure of the uppermost cloud deck and the
mixing ratio of methane, if the uppermost cloud deck is located at the pressure
level of 0.6 - 1.5 bars. Further increasing the signal-to-noise ratio can
improve the measurement range of the cloud deck pressure to 0.2 - 4 bars. The
strong and the weak absorption bands of methane allow the simultaneous
measurements of cloud and gas; when the uppermost cloud deck is located
shallower than the pressure level of 0.2, the weak bands are muted, and the
cloud deck pressure and the mixing ratio of methane are not distinguishable
from a single reflection spectrum. Second, future direct-imaging exoplanet
missions may detect the broadband reflectivity of a few super-Earth exoplanets.
If having H2O-dominated atmospheres, directly imaged super Earths are likely to
have water clouds located shallower than 1E-3 bars. The very high clouds on

planets would occupy a confined phase space in the color-color diagrams.

We find that the bandstructure is dramatically deformed and the degeneracy of

double and the van Hove singularity points are separated in energy. The
dependence of these effects on the strength of strain, its applied direction
and the twist angle is carefully clarified. As an important result, we
demonstrate that the position of van Hove singularities can be modulated by
strain, suggesting the possibility of observing this phenomenon at low energy
in a large range of twist angle (i.e., larger than $10^\circ$). Unfortunately,
these interesting/important phenomena have not been clarified in the previous
works based on the continuum approximation. While they are in good agreement

SiO2/p+-Si substrates. The electrostatic performance and stability of our diode
were successfully improved toward ideal current-voltage (I-V) behavior by
adopting the fluoropolymer CYTOP encapsulation layer on top of our diode;
reduction of reverse-bias leakage current and enhancement of forward-bias on
current were achieved along with good aging stability in air ambient. Such
performance improvement is attributed to the intrinsic properties of CYTOP
materials with C-F bonds whose strong dipole moment causes hole accumulation,
while the strong hydrophobicity of CYTOP would prevent ambient molecule
adsorption on 2D semiconductor surface. Moreover, fabricated on glass, our p-n
diode displayed good dynamic rectification at over 100 Hz, without displacement
current-induced signal overshoot/undershoot which was shown in the other diode
on SiO2/p+-Si. Little I-V hysteresis in our diode is another benefit of glass
substrate. We conclude that our CYTOP-encapsulated WSe2/MoS2 p-n diode on glass
is a high performance and ambient stable 2D nanodevice toward future advanced
electronics.

role of chemical composition in the evolution of symbiotic binaries, to map
their parent population, and to trace their mass transfer history. However, the
number of symbiotic giants with fairly well determined photospheric composition
is still insufficient for statistical analyses. This is the third in a series
of papers on the chemical composition of symbiotic giants determined from high
resolution (R ~ 50000), near-IR spectra. Here we present results for 24 S-type
systems. Spectrum synthesis methods employing standard local thermal
equilibrium analysis and atmosphere models were used to obtain photospheric
abundances of CNO and elements around the iron peak (Fe, Ti, Ni, and Sc). Our
analysis reveals metallicities distributed in a wide range from slightly
supersolar ([Fe/H] ~ +0.35 dex) to significantly subsolar ([Fe/H] ~ -0.8 dex)
but principally with near-solar and slightly subsolar metallicity ([Fe/H] ~
-0.4 to -0.3 dex). The enrichment in 14N isotope, found in all these objects,
indicates that the giants have experienced the first dredge-up. This was
confirmed in a number of objects by the low 12C/13C ratio (5-23). We found that
the relative abundance of [Ti/Fe] is generally large in red symbiotic systems.

a critical behavior in finite time. We follow the approach of Bleher and
Kuijlaars to reformulate the model in terms of orthogonal polynomials with
respect to a Hermitian form. This reformulation was shown to capture the
essential features of the normal matrix model in the subcritical regime, namely
that the zeros of the polynomials tend to a number of segments (the motherbody)
inside a domain (the droplet) that attracts the eigenvalues in the normal
matrix model.
  In the present paper we analyze the supercritical regime and we find that the
large $n$ behavior is described by the evolution of a spectral curve satisfying
the Boutroux condition. The Boutroux condition determines a system of contours
$\Sigma_1$, consisting of the motherbody and whiskers sticking out of the
domain. We find a second critical behavior at which the original motherbody
shrinks to a point at the origin and only the whiskers remain.
  In the regime before the second criticality we also give strong asymptotics
of the orthogonal polynomials by means of a steepest descent analysis of a $3
\times 3$ matrix valued Riemann-Hilbert problem. It follows that the zeros of
the orthogonal polynomials tend to $\Sigma_1$, with the exception of at most
three spurious zeros.

and warm dust in thermal equilibrium, respectively, correlate tightly with
ongoing star formation. The contribution from cool dust excited by evolved
stars also increases as the wavelength increases in the far-infrared (FIR)
wavelength range. The spectral features of ionized polycyclic aromatic
hydrocarbons (PAHs) around rest-frame 8 micron are excited by the moderated
radiation field related to evolved stars as well, rather than by the intensive
radiation field related to young stars. Even though the carriers of PAHs could
be treated as types of VSG with a smaller scale, the radiation condition
between PAHs and classic VSGs seems to be significantly different. The formulae
to calculate the total infrared luminosity L[TIR] using L[8(dust)] and L[24]
are re-scaled and we find that the L[8(dust)] (L[24]) formula likely
underestimates (overestimates) L[TIR] for galaxies with unusual current star

purpose of identification of hazardous cosmic objects able to impact the Earth.
Development of the methods that allow to improve accuracy of determining the
asteroids size (i.e. whether it measures tens or hundreds meters in diameter)
is important for correctly estimating the degree of damage which they can cause
(either regional or global catastrophes, respectively). In this paper we
suggest a novel method of estimating the sizes of the passive cosmic objects
using the radiolocation probing by ultra-high-resolution nanosecond signals to
obtain radar signatures. The modulation envelope of the reflected signal, which
is a radar portrait of the cosmic object, is subjected to time scale
transformation to carrier Doppler frequency by means of radioimpulse strobing.
The shift of a strobe within the probing period will be performed by radial
motion of the object which will allow to forgo the special autoshift circuit
used in the oscillographic technical equipment. The measured values of duration
of radiolocation portrait can be used to estimate the mean radius of the object
by using the average spatial length of the portrait. The method makes it
possible to appraise the sizes of cosmic objects through their radiolocation
portrait duration, with accuracy that is independent of the objects range.

can advance the research of online handwriting recognition. Currently, there is
no online Arabic handwriting database with large lexicon, high coverage, large

different backgrounds, genders and ages. Annotation and verification tools are

>85% of the spin period and exhibits strong evolution with observing frequency.
For the first time we measure phase-resolved polarization properties and
spectral indices of radio emission throughout almost all of the on-pulse

M28A to other known gamma-ray millisecond pulsars and to speculate that M28A's
radio emission originates in multiple regions within its magnetosphere (i.e.
both in the slot or outer gaps near the light cylinder and at lower altitudes
above the polar cap). M28A is one of the handful of pulsars which are known to
emit Giant Pulses (GPs) -- short, bright radio pulses of unknown nature. We
report a drop in the linear polarization of the average profile in both windows
of GP generation and also a `W'-shaped absorption feature (resembling a double
notch), partly overlapping with one of the GP windows. The GPs themselves have
broadband spectra consisting of multiple patches with fractional spectral width
($\Delta\nu/\nu$) of about 0.07. Although our time resolution was not
sufficient to resolve the GP structure on the microsecond scale, we argue that

associated with a drop in plasma density and overall stored energy. In one

computing related to free identical particles.
  Free fermions correspond to a set of two-qubit gates known as matchgates.
Matchgates are classically simulable when acting on nearest neighbors on a
path, but universal for quantum computing when acting on distant qubits or when
SWAP gates are available. I generalize these results in two ways. First, I show
that SWAP is only one in a large family of gates that uplift matchgates to
quantum universality. In fact, I show that the set of all matchgates plus any
nonmatchgate parity-preserving two-qubit gate is universal, and interpret this
fact in terms of local invariants of two-qubit gates. Second, I investigate the
power of matchgates in arbitrary connectivity graphs, showing they are
universal on any connected graph other than a path or a cycle, and classically
simulable on a cycle. I also prove the same dichotomy for the XY interaction.
  Free bosons give rise to a model known as BosonSampling. BosonSampling
consists of (i) preparing a Fock state of n photons, (ii) interfering these
photons in an m-mode linear interferometer, and (iii) measuring the output in
the Fock basis. Sampling approximately from the resulting distribution should
be classically hard, under reasonable complexity assumptions. Here I show that
exact BosonSampling remains hard even if the linear-optical circuit has
constant depth. I also report several experiments where three-photon
interference was observed in integrated interferometers of various sizes,
providing some of the first implementations of BosonSampling in this regime.
The experiments also focus on the bosonic bunching behavior and on validation
of BosonSampling devices. This thesis contains descriptions of the numerical
analyses done on the experimental data, omitted from the corresponding

develop point-wise confidence intervals for individual elements of the

theory of quantum entanglement is currently leading to a paradigm shift in
understanding quantum correlations in many body systems and in this work we
show how symmetry breaking can be understood from this wavefunction centered
point of view. We demonstrate that the existence of symmetry breaking is a
consequence of the geometric structure of the convex set of reduced density
matrices of all possible many body wavefunctions. The surfaces of those convex
bodies exhibit non-analytic behavior in the form of ruled surfaces, which turn
out to be the defining signatures for the emergence of symmetry breaking and of
an associated order parameter.
  We illustrate this by plotting the convex sets arising in the context of
three paradigmatic examples of many body systems exhibiting symmetry breaking:
the quantum Ising model in transverse magnetic field, exhibiting a second order
quantum phase transition; the classical Ising model at finite temperature in
two dimensions, which orders below a critical temperature $T_c$; and a system
of free bosons at finite temperature in three dimensions, exhibiting the
phenomenon of Bose-Einstein condensation together with an associated order
parameter $\langle\psi\rangle$. Remarkably, these convex sets look all very
much alike. We believe that this wavefunction based way of looking at phase
transitions demystifies the emergence of order parameters and provides a unique
novel tool for studying exotic quantum phenomena.

is to reconstruct the a high-dimensional $K$-sparse signal
$\mathbf{x}\in\mathbb{R}^N$, from low-dimensional linear measurements with and
without noise. Our key contribution is a new compressed sensing framework
through a new family of carefully designed sparse measurement matrices
associated with minimal measurement costs and a low-complexity recovery
algorithm. The measurement matrix in our framework is designed based on the
well-crafted sparsification through capacity-approaching sparse-graph codes,
where the sparse coefficients can be recovered efficiently in a few iterations
by performing simple error decoding over the observations. We formally connect
this general recovery problem with sparse-graph decoding in packet
communication systems, and analyze our framework in terms of the measurement
cost, time complexity and recovery performance. In the noiseless setting, our
framework can recover any arbitrary $K$-sparse signal in $O(K)$ time using $2K$
measurements asymptotically with high probability. In the noisy setting, when
the sparse coefficients take values in a finite and quantized alphabet, our
framework can achieve the same goal in time $O(K\log(N/K))$ using
$O(K\log(N/K))$ measurements obtained from measurement matrix with elements
$\{-1,0,1\}$. When the sparsity $K$ is sub-linear in the signal dimension
$K=O(N^\delta)$ for some $0<\delta<1$, our results are order-optimal in terms
of measurement costs and run-time, both of which are sub-linear in the signal
dimension $N$. The sub-linear measurement cost and run-time can also be
achieved with continuous-valued sparse coefficients, with a slight increment in
the logarithmic factors. This offers the desired scalability of our framework
that can potentially enable real-time or near-real-time processing for massive

extended to isospin-asymmetric matter. Fluctuations beyond mean-field
approximation are treated in the framework of the functional renormalization
group. The nuclear liquid-gas phase transition is investigated in detail as a
function of the proton fraction in asymmetric matter. The equations of state at
zero temperature of both symmetric nuclear matter and pure neutron matter are
found to be in good agreement with realistic many-body computations. We also
study the density dependence of the pion mass in the medium. The question of
chiral symmetry restoration in neutron matter is addressed; we find a
stabilization of the phase with spontaneously broken chiral symmetry once
fluctuations are included. Finally, neutron star matter including beta
equilibrium is discussed. The model satisfies the constraints imposed by the
existence of two-solar-mass neutron stars.

  completed scattering","12 pages, no figures, thoroughly rewritten",,,,"quant-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  It is shown that in the state space of a quantum particle involved in a
one-dimensional completed scattering (OCS) there is a superselection rule (SSR)
induced by the dichotomous physical context that determines the properties of a
quantum ensemble of scattering particles in the disjoint spatial regions
located on the different sides of the potential barrier at asymptotically large
distances from it. At the initial stage of the OCS this context is associated,
in the general case, with two sources of particles located on the different
sides of the barrier; and at the final stage it is associated, in the general
case, with two particle detectors located on different sides of the barrier.
The role of a superselection operator is played by the Pauli matrix $\sigma_3$
that divides the space of in- and out-asymptotes into two coherent sectors. In
the course of the OCS, its unitary quantum dynamics crosses these sectors. In
particular, in the scattering problem with one source and two detectors, a pure
initial state of a particle is converted into a mixed final state. According to
this rule, the OCS is a complex quantum process consisting of two coherent
subprocesses -- transmission and reflection; the average value of any
observable as well as characteristic times can be defined for the subprocesses
only. It is shown that the quantum dynamics of both subprocesses at all stages
of scattering is uniquely determined by the initial state of the whole ensemble
of particles and by the final states of transmitted and reflected particles.

one that transforms linearly under scene motions, we show, using the theory of
group representations, that any such representation is equivalent to a
combination of the elementary irreducible representations. We derive a striking
relationship between irreducibility and the statistical dependency structure of
the representation, by showing that under restricted conditions, irreducible
representations are decorrelated. Under partial observability, as induced by
the perspective projection of a scene onto the image plane, the motion group
does not have a linear action on the space of images, so that it becomes
necessary to perform inference over a latent representation that does transform
linearly. This idea is demonstrated in a model of rotating NORB objects that
employs a latent representation of the non-commutative 3D rotation group SO(3).

investigated the statistical effects of assuming two different mechanisms for
triggering AGN activity on the properties of AGN host galaxies. We have
considered a first accretion mode where AGN activity is triggered by disk
instabilities (DI) in isolated galaxies, and a second feeding mode where such
an activity is triggered by galaxy mergers and fly-by events (interactions,
IT). We obtained the following results:i) for hosts with $M_* \lesssim 10^{11}
M_{\bigodot}$, both DI and IT modes are able to account for the observed AGN
hosts stellar mass function; for more massive hosts, the DI scenario predicts a
lower space density than the IT model, lying below the observational estimates
for z>0.8.ii) The analysis of the color-magnitude diagram (CMD) of AGN hosts
for redshift z < 1.5 can provide a good observational test to effectively
discriminate between the DI and IT mode, since DIs are expected to yield AGN
host galaxy colors skewed towards bluer colors, while in the IT scenario the
majority of hosts are expected to reside in the red sequence.iii) While both IT
and DI scenarios can account for AGN triggered in main sequence or starburst
galaxies, DIs fail in triggering AGN activity in passive galaxies.iv) The two
modes are characterized by a different duration of the AGN phase, with DIs
lasting even on time scales $\sim $ Gyr, much longer with respect to the IT
scenario.v) The scatter of the $SFR-L_{bol}$ relation could represent another
crucial diagnostics to discriminate between the two triggering modes, since the
DI scenario predicts an appreciably lower scatter of the relation than the IT
scenario. vi) Disk instabilities are not able to account for the observed
fraction of AGN in groups for z < 1 and clusters for z < 0.7, while the IT
scenario provides a good match to observational data.

black-hole X-ray transients (BHTs), based on the evolution traced in a
hardness-luminosity diagram (HLD), and we offer a physical interpretation.
  Methods: The basic ingredient in our interpretation is the Poynting-Robertson
Cosmic Battery (PRCB, Contopoulos & Kazanas 1998), which provides locally the
poloidal magnetic field needed for the ejection of the jet. In addition, we
make two assumptions, easily justifiable. The first is that the mass-accretion
rate to the black hole in a BHT outburst has a generic bell-shaped form. This
is guaranteed by the observational fact that all BHTs start their outburst and
end it at the quiescent state. The second assumption is that at low accretion
rates the accretion flow is geometrically thick, ADAF-like, while at high
accretion rates it is geometrically thin.
  Results: Both, at the beginning and the end of an outburst, the PRCB
establishes a strong poloidal magnetic field in the ADAF-like part of the
accretion flow, and this explains naturally why a jet is always present in the
right part of the HLD. In the left part of the HLD, the accretion flow is in
the form of a thin disk, and such a disk cannot sustain a strong poloidal
magnetic filed. Thus, no jet is expected in this part of the HLD. The
counterclockwise traversal of the HLD is explained as follows: the poloidal
magnetic field in the ADAF forces the flow to remain ADAF and the source to
move upwards in the HLD rather than to turn left. Thus, the history of the
system determines the counterclockwise traversal of the HLD. As a result, no
BHT is expected to ever traverse the entire HLD curve in the clockwise
direction.
  Conclusions: We offer a physical interpretation of accretion and ejection in
BHTs with only one parameter, the mass transfer rate.

component in designing embedded systems. One of the problems in designing an
instruction set for such processors is determining the number of registers is
needed in the processor that will optimize the computational time and the cost.
The performance of a processor may fall short due to register spilling, which
is caused by the lack of available registers in a processor. In the design
perspective, it will result in processors with great performance and low power
consumption if we can avoid register spilling by deciding a value for the
number of registers needed in an ASIP. However, as of now, it has not clearly
been recognized how the number of registers changes with different application
domains. In this paper, we evaluated whether different application domains have
any significant effect on register spilling and therefore the performance of a
processor so that we could use different number of registers when building
ASIPs for different application domains rather than using a constant set of
registers. Such utilization of registers will result in processors with high
performance, low cost and low power consumption.

With the advancing technology and expertise in areas such as AI, cryptography

We introduce two families of multidimensional persistence, namely
pseudo-multidimensional persistence and multiscale multidimensional
persistence. The former is generated via the repeated applications of
persistent homology filtration to high dimensional data, such as results from
molecular dynamics or partial differential equations. The latter is constructed
via isotropic and anisotropic scales that create new simiplicial complexes and
associated topological spaces. The utility, robustness and efficiency of the
proposed topological methods are demonstrated via protein folding, protein
flexibility analysis, the topological denoising of cryo-electron microscopy
data, and the scale dependence of nano particles. Topological transition
between partial folded and unfolded proteins has been observed in
multidimensional persistence. The separation between noise topological
signatures and molecular topological fingerprints is achieved by the
Laplace-Beltrami flow. The multiscale multidimensional persistent homology
reveals relative local features in Betti-0 invariants and the relatively global
characteristics of Betti-1 and Betti-2 invariants.

analysing a few thousand power traces that requires about an hour of
computational time on a general purpose CPU. Due to the severity of this
situation, a large number of researchers work on countermeasures to such
attacks. Verifying that a proposed countermeasure works well requires
performing the CPA attack on about 1.5 million power traces. Such processing,
even for a single attempt of verification on commodity hardware would run for
several days making the verification process infeasible. Modern Graphics
Processing Units (GPUs) have support for thousands of light weight threads,
making them ideal for parallelizable algorithms like CPA. While the cost of a
GPU being lesser than a high performance multicore server, still the GPU

grids, when compared to the conventional fixed grid networks and therefore
utilize the frequency spectrum efficiently. For providing survivability in
EONs, we consider a recently proposed survivability method for conventional
fixed grid networks, known as pre-configured backup protection with sharing
(PBPS), because of its benefits over the traditional survivability approaches
such as dedicated and shared protection. In PBPS, backup paths can be
pre-configured and at the same time they can share resources. Therefore, both
short recovery time and efficient resource usage can be achieved. We find that
the existing switch architectures do not support both PBPS and EONs.
Specifically, we identify and illustrate that, if a switch architecture is not
carefully designed, several key problems/issues might arise in certain
scenarios. Such problems include unnecessary resource consumption, inability of
using existing free resources, and incapability of sharing backup paths. These
problems appear when PBPS is adopted in EONs and they do not arise in fixed
grid networks. In this paper, we propose new switch architectures which support
both PBPS and EONs. Particularly, we illustrate that, our switch architectures
avoid the specific problems/issues mentioned above. Therefore, our switch
architectures support using resources more efficiently and reducing blocking of
requests.

the Bloch-Kato conjecture. Also we introduce the notion of cyclotomic

aligned in the direction of the Sun's travel through the interstellar medium
(ISM) extending for 1000's of AUs (AU: astronomical unit). Here we show, based
on magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations, that the tension (hoop) force of the
twisted magnetic field of the sun confines the solar wind plasma beyond the
termination shock and drives jets to the North and South very much like
astrophysical jets. These jets are deflected into the tail region by the motion
of the Sun through the ISM similar to bent galactic jets moving through the
intergalactic medium. The interstellar wind blows the two jets into the tail
but is not strong enough to force the lobes into a single comet-like tail, as
happens to some astrophysical jets (Morsony et al. 2013). Instead, the
interstellar wind flows around the heliosphere and into equatorial region
between the two jets. As in some astrophysical jets that are kink unstable
(Porth et al. 2014) we show here that the heliospheric jets are turbulent (due
to large-scale MHD instabilities and reconnection) and strongly mix the solar
wind with the ISM beyond 400 AU. The resulting turbulence has important
implications for particle acceleration in the heliosphere. The two-lobe
structure is consistent with the energetic neutral atoms (ENAs) images of the

resources, which can vary from ancient printed documents to present electronic
material. The rapid conversion of material available in traditional libraries
to digital form needs a significant amount of work if we are to maintain the
format and the look of the electronic documents as same as their printed
counterparts. Most of the printed documents contain not only characters and its
formatting but also some associated non text objects such as tables, charts and
graphical objects. It is challenging to detect them and to concentrate on the
format preservation of the contents while reproducing them. To address this
issue, we propose an algorithm using local thresholds for word space and line
height to locate and extract all categories of tables from scanned document
images. From the experiments performed on 298 documents, we conclude that our
algorithm has an overall accuracy of about 75% in detecting tables from the
scanned document images. Since the algorithm does not completely depend on rule
lines, it can detect all categories of tables in a range of scanned documents
with different font types, styles and sizes to extract their formatting
features. Moreover, the algorithm can be applied to locate tables in multi
column layouts with small modification in layout analysis. Treating tables with
their existing formatting features will tremendously help the reproducing of
printed documents for reprinting and updating purposes.

  (PSISPs)","The 7th International Conference on Information and Automation for
  Sustainability (ICIAfS) 2014",,,,"cs.AR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  ASIPs are designed in order to execute instructions of a particular domain of
applications. The designing of ASIPs addresses the major challenges faced by a
system on chip such as size, cost, performance and energy consumption. The
higher the number of similar instructions within the domain to be mapped the
lesser the energy consumption, the smaller the size and the higher the
performance of the ASIP. Thus, designing processors for domains with more
similar programs would overcome these issues. This paper describes the
investigation of whether the domains of programmer specific programs have any
significance like application specific program domains and thus, whether the
approach of designing processors known as Programmer Specific Instruction Set
Processors is worthwhile. We performed the evaluation at the instruction level
by using four different measures to obtain the similarity of programs: (1) by
the existence of each instruction, (2) by the frequency of each instruction,
(3) by two consecutive instruction patterns and (4) by three consecutive
instruction patterns of application specific and programmer specific programs.
We found that although programmer specific instructions show some impact on the
similarity measures, they are much smaller and therefore insignificant compared
to the impact from application specific programs.

and need to find the cheapest subgraph which connects each of the terminal
pairs together. In 1991, Agrawal, Klein, and Ravi, and Goemans and Williamson
gave primal-dual constant-factor approximation algorithms for this problem;
until now, the only constant-factor approximations we know are via linear
programming relaxations.
  We consider the following greedy algorithm: Given terminal pairs in a metric
space, call a terminal ""active"" if its distance to its partner is non-zero.
Pick the two closest active terminals (say $s_i, t_j$), set the distance
between them to zero, and buy a path connecting them. Recompute the metric, and
repeat. Our main result is that this algorithm is a constant-factor
approximation.
  We also use this algorithm to give new, simpler constructions of cost-sharing
schemes for Steiner forest. In particular, the first ""group-strict"" cost-shares
for this problem implies a very simple combinatorial sampling-based algorithm
for stochastic Steiner forest.

structural biochemistry. Previous findings, from computational biology (Ota and
Agard, 2005), have proposed that heat diffuses in a protein through cognate
protein allosteric pathways. This work studied heat diffusion in the well-known
PDZ-2 protein, and confirmed that this protein has two cognate allosteric
pathways and that heat flows preferentially through these. Also, a new property
was also observed for protein structures - heat diffuses asymmetrically through
the structures. The underling structure of this asymmetrical heat flow was a
normal length hydrogen bond (~2.85 {\AA}) that acted as a thermal rectifier. In
contrast, thermal rectification was compromised in short hydrogen bonds (~2.60
{\AA}), giving rise to symmetrical thermal diffusion. Asymmetrical heat
diffusion was due, on a higher scale, to the local, structural organization of
residues that, in turn, was also mediated by hydrogen bonds. This
asymmetrical/symmetrical energy flow may be relevant for allosteric signal
communication directionality in proteins and for the control of heat flow in
materials science.

studied by density functional theory calculations. The simulation results show
that the molecule needs to acquire parallel orientation with respect to the

more active in dissociating N2 than Fe(100) surface due to its morphology. The
interaction between antibonding molecular orbitals of N2 and partially filled
$3d$ orbitals of Fe atoms on the surface may be the key to the molecular
dissociation of N2. To break down the triple bond of N2, the electron density
on the surface needs to be partially transferred to the molecule to fill the
antibonding molecular orbitals of the nitrogen molecule. The present result may
provide some insights on the dissociation mechanism of molecules over

Networks (ANNs) for vision, classification, and inference problems. An
artificial neuron sums N weighted inputs and passes the result through a
non-linear transfer function. Large-scale ANNs impose very high computing
requirements for training and classification, leading to great interest in the
use of post-CMOS devices to realize them in an energy efficient manner. In this
paper, we propose a spin-transfer-torque (STT) device based on Domain Wall
Motion (DWM) magnetic strip that can efficiently implement a Soft-limiting
Non-linear Neuron (SNN) operating at ultra-low supply voltage and current. In
contrast to previous spin-based neurons that can only realize hard-limiting
transfer functions, the proposed STT-SNN displays a continuous resistance
change with varying input current, and can therefore be employed to implement a
soft-limiting neuron transfer function. Soft-limiting neurons are greatly
preferred to hard-limiting ones due to their much improved modeling capacity,
which leads to higher network accuracy and lower network complexity. We also
present an ANN hardware design employing the proposed STT-SNNs and Memristor
Crossbar Arrays (MCA) as synapses. The ultra-low voltage operation of the
magneto metallic STT-SNN enables the programmable MCA-synapses, computing
analog-domain weighted summation of input voltages, to also operate at
ultra-low voltage. We modeled the STT-SNN using micro-magnetic simulation and
evaluated them using an ANN for character recognition. Comparisons with analog
and digital CMOS neurons show that STT-SNNs can achieve more than two orders of
magnitude lower energy consumption.
