the accretion disk was channelled by the neutron star magnetosphere and
accreted onto its polar caps. According to standard disk accretion theory, for
pulsations to be observed the mass in-flow rate in the disk was likely larger
than the amount of plasma actually reaching the neutron star surface; an
outflow launched by the fast rotating magnetosphere then probably took place,
in agreement with the observed broad-band spectral energy distribution. We also
report about the non-detection of X-ray pulsations during a recent observation
performed while the source behaved as a rotationally-powered radio pulsar.

technique, polar coding, which is used to construct a class of error correction

that this class of codes, called polar codes, achieve the symmetric capacity
--- the mutual information evaluated at the uniform input distribution ---of
any stationary binary discrete memoryless channel with low complexity encoders
and decoders requiring in the order of $O(N\log N)$ operations in the
block-length $N$. This discovery settled the long standing open problem left by
Shannon of finding low complexity codes achieving the channel capacity.
  Polar coding settled an open problem in information theory, yet opened plenty
of challenging problems that need to be addressed. A significant part of this
thesis is dedicated to advancing the knowledge about this technique in two
directions. The first one provides a better understanding of polar coding by
generalizing some of the existing results and discussing their implications,
and the second one studies the robustness of the theory over communication
models introducing various forms of uncertainty or variations into the
probabilistic model of the channel.

how all variables interact, is indeed a demanding task. In reality, settings
often arise for which an individual merely possesses partial knowledge of the
domain, and yet, is expected to give adequate answers to a variety of posed
queries. That is, although precise answers to some queries, in principle,
cannot be achieved, a range of plausible answers is attainable for each query
given the available partial knowledge. In this paper, we propose the
Multi-Context Model (MCM), a new graphical model to represent the state of
partial knowledge as to a domain. MCM is a middle ground between Probabilistic
Logic, Bayesian Logic, and Probabilistic Graphical Models. For this model we
discuss: (i) the dynamics of constructing a contradiction-free MCM, i.e., to
form partial beliefs regarding a domain in a gradual and probabilistically
consistent way, and (ii) how to perform inference, i.e., to evaluate a
probability of interest involving some variables of the domain.

measured using particle image velocimetry (PIV), revealing the possibility of
two different flow patterns. A phase-dependent proper orthogonal decomposition
(POD) analysis showed that one or the other flow pattern would appear in the
average flow, sampled from test to test or sub-sampled within a single test;
each data set contained individual cycles showing one flow pattern or the
other. Three-dimensional velocity data from a large-eddy simulation (LES) of
the engine showed that the PIV plane was cutting through a region of high shear
between the intake jet and another large flow structure. Rotating the
measurement plane 10{\deg} revealed one or the other flow structure observed in
the PIV measurements. Thus, it was hypothesized that cycle-to-cycle variations
in the swirl ratio result in the two different flow patterns in the PIV plane.
Having an unambiguous metric to reveal large-scale flow CCV, causes for this
variability were examined within the possible sources present in the available
testing. In particular, variations in intake-port and cylinder pressure,
lateral valve oscillations, and engine RPM were examined as potential causes
for the cycle-to-cycle flow ariations using the phase-dependent POD
coefficients. No direct correlation was seen between the intake port pressure,
or the pressure drop across the intake valve, and the in-cylinder flow pattern.
A correlation was observed between dominant flow pattern and cycle-to-cycle
variations in intake valve horizontal position. RPM values and in-cylinder flow
patterns did not correlate directly. However, a shift in flow pattern was
observed between early and late cycles in a 2900-cycle test after an
approximately 5 rpm engine speed perturbation.

monodromy arises from torsional cycles in a type IIB compactification. A class
of monomial potentials is obtained with specific values for the power index.
Moreover, the inflaton mass changes profile due to the couplings between
various fields after compactification. Consequently, the potential obtains a
step-like profile at some critical scale. We study the cosmological
implications of one concrete realization of this model. At the background
level, it realizes a sufficiently long inflationary stage, which allows for the
violation of the slow-roll conditions for a short period of time when the
inflaton is close to the critical scale. Accordingly, the Hubble horizon is
perturbed and affects the dynamics of primordial cosmological perturbations. In
particular, we analyze the angular power spectrum of B-mode polarization and
find a boost on very large scales. We also find that the amplitude of scalar
perturbations is suppressed near the critical scale. Thus our model provides an
interpretation for the low-$\ell$ suppression of temperature anisotropies in
the CMB power spectrum. We examine these effects and confront the model to
observations.

""follower-followee"") -- arise naturally in many social networks and other
complex networks, giving rise to directed graphs (or digraphs) as basic
topological models for these networks. Reciprocity, defined for a digraph as
the percentage of edges with a reciprocal edge, is a key metric that has been
used in the literature to compare different directed networks and provide
""hints"" about their structural properties: for example, are reciprocal edges
generated randomly by chance or are there other processes driving their
generation? In this paper we study the problem of maximizing achievable
reciprocity for an ensemble of digraphs with the same prescribed in- and
out-degree sequences. We show that the maximum reciprocity hinges crucially on
the in- and out-degree sequences, which may be intuitively interpreted as
constraints on some ""social capacities"" of nodes and impose fundamental limits
on achievable reciprocity. We show that it is NP-complete to decide the
achievability of a simple upper bound on maximum reciprocity, and provide
conditions for achieving it. We demonstrate that many real networks exhibit
reciprocities surprisingly close to the upper bound, which implies that users
in these social networks are in a sense more ""social"" than suggested by the
empirical reciprocity alone in that they are more willing to reciprocate,
subject to their ""social capacity"" constraints. We find some surprising linear
relationships between empirical reciprocity and the bound. We also show that a
particular type of small network motifs that we call 3-paths are the major
source of loss in reciprocity for real networks.

  Database Operator","13 pages",,,,"cs.DB","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Similarity group-by (SGB, for short) has been proposed as a relational
database operator to match the needs of emerging database applications. Many
SGB operators that extend SQL have been proposed in the literature, e.g.,
similarity operators in the one-dimensional space. These operators have various
semantics. Depending on how these operators are implemented, some of the
implementations may lead to different groupings of the data. Hence, if SQL code
is ported from one database system to another, it is not guaranteed that the
code will produce the same results. In this paper, we investigate the various
semantics for the relational similarity group-by operators in the
multi-dimensional space. We define the class of order-independent SGB operators
that produce the same results regardless of the order in which the input data
is presented to them. Using the notion of interval graphs borrowed from graph
theory, we prove that, for certain SGB operators, there exist order-independent
implementations. For each of these operators, we provide a sample algorithm
that is order-independent. Also, we prove that for other SGB operators, there
does not exist an order-independent implementation for them, and hence these
SGB operators are ill-defined and should not be adopted in extensions to SQL to
realize similarity group-by. In this paper, we introduce an SGB operator,
namely SGB-All, for grouping multi-dimensional data using similarity. SGB-All
forms groups such that a data item, say O, belongs to a group, say G, if and
only if O is within a user-defined threshold from all other data items in G. In
other words, each group in SGB-All forms a clique of nearby data items in the
multi-dimensional space. We prove that SGB-All are order-independent, i.e.,
there is at least one algorithm for each option that is independent of the
presentation order of the input data.

exponentially at very large distances compared to $1/m$, leaving a pure
Chern-Simons theory with level number $k$. The focus of this research is the
$near$ Chern-Simons limit of the theory, where the distance is large enough to
give an almost topological theory, with a small contribution from the
Yang-Mills term. It is shown that this almost topological theory consists of
two copies of Chern-Simons with level number $k/2$, very similar to the
Chern-Simons splitting of topologically massive AdS gravity model. As $m$
approaches to infinity, the split parts add up to give the original
Chern-Simons term with level $k$. Also, gauge invariance of the split
Chern-Simons theories is discussed for odd values of $k$. Furthermore, a
relation between the observables of topologically massive Yang-Mills theory and
Chern-Simons theory is obtained. It is shown that one of the two split
Chern-Simons pieces is associated with Wilson loops while the other with 't
Hooft loops. This allows one to use skein relations to calculate topologically
massive Yang-Mills theory observables in the near Chern-Simons limit. Finally,
motivated with the topologically massive AdS gravity model, Chern-Simons
splitting concept is extended to pure Yang-Mills theory at large distances. It
is shown that pure Yang-Mills theory acts like two Chern-Simons theories with
level numbers $k/2$ and $-k/2$ at large scales. At very large scales, these two
terms cancel to make the theory trivial, as required by the existence of a mass
gap.

organisms, often attributed to ecological interactions among species. Here we
have synthesized a global timetree of life from 2,274 studies representing
50,632 species and examined the pattern and rate of diversification as well as
the timing of speciation. We found that species diversity has been mostly
expanding overall and in many smaller groups of species, and that the rate of
diversification in eukaryotes has been mostly constant. We also identified, and
avoided, potential biases that may have influenced previous analyses of
diversification including low levels of taxon sampling, small clade size, and
the inclusion of stem branches in clade analyses. We found consistency in
time-to-speciation among plants and animals, approximately two million years,
as measured by intervals of crown and stem species times. Together, this
clock-like change at different levels suggests that speciation and
diversification are processes dominated by random events and that adaptive
change is largely a separate process.

Augmented Lagrangian approach to constrained optimization. We first propose an
alternative augmentation of the Lagrangian to handle the inequality case (not
based on slack variables) and a corresponding ""central"" update of the dual
parameters. We proove certain properties of this update: roughly, in the case
of LPs and when the ""constraint activity"" does not change between iterations,
the KKT conditions hold after just one iteration. This gives essential insight
on when the method is efficient in practise. We then present our main
contribution, which are consistent any-time (non-central) updates of the dual
parameters (i.e., updating the dual parameters when we are not currently at an
extremum of the Lagrangian). Similar to the primal-dual Newton method, this
leads to an algorithm that parallely updates the primal and dual solutions, not
distinguishing between an outer loop to adapt the dual parameters and an inner
loop to minimize the Lagrangian. We again proof certain properties of this
anytime update: roughly, in the case of LPs and when constraint activities
would not change, the dual solution converges after one iteration. Again, this
gives essential insight in the caveats of the method: if constraint activities
change the method may destablize. We propose simple smoothing, step-size
adaptation and regularization mechanisms to counteract this effect and
guarantee monotone convergence. Finally, we evaluate the proposed method on
random LPs as well as on standard robot trajectory optimization problems,
confirming our motivation and intuition that our approach performs well if the
problem structure implies moderate stability of constraint activity.

accelerations -- for example, a0 cH0/2pi -- points to its possibly decreasing
with cosmic time. I begin to consider the secular changes induced in galactic
systems by such presumed variations, assumed adiabatic. It is important to
understand these effects, in isolation from other evolutionary influences, in
order to identify or constrain a0 variations by detection of induced effects,
or lack thereof. I find that as long as the system is fully in the deep-MOND
regime -- as applies to many galactic systems -- the adiabatic response of the
system obeys simple scaling laws. For example, in a system that would be
stationary for fixed a0, the system expands homologously as a0^{-1/4}, while
internal velocities decrease uniformly as a0^{1/4}. If a0 is proportional to cH
at all relevant times, this change amounts to a factor of ~ 2.5 since redshift
10. For a system stationary in a rotating frame, the angular frequency
decreases as a0^{1/2}. The accelerations increase relative to a0 as a0^{-1/4},
pushing the system towards the Newtonian regime. All this follows from the
appearance of a0 in MOND and the scale invariance of the deep-MOND limit -- two
basic tenets of MOND. More complicated evolution ensues when parts of the
system become Newtonian, or are so from inception. For example, these parts may
become unstable, not being protected by MOND's stabilizing effects. The
existence of such regions also modifies the MONDian regime, since they affect
the potential everywhere, and since constituents might migrate between the
Newtonian and MONDian regimes. Studying these last effects would require
detailed numerical calculations.

complicated by the fact that the Fisher information matrix, on which most
optimality criteria depend, is computationally expensive to evaluate. Our focus
is on the design of experiments for likelihood estimation of parameters in the
conditional model. We provide two novel approximations that substantially
reduce the computational cost of evaluating the information matrix by complete
enumeration of response outcomes, or Monte Carlo approximations thereof: (i) an
asymptotic approximation which is accurate when there is strong dependence
between observations in the same block; (ii) an approximation via Kriging
interpolators. For logistic random intercept models, we show how interpolation
can be especially effective for finding pseudo-Bayesian designs that
incorporate uncertainty in the values of the model parameters. The new results
are used to provide the first evaluation of the efficiency, for estimating
conditional models, of optimal designs from closed-form approximations to the
information matrix derived from marginal models. It is found that correcting
for the marginal attenuation of parameters in binary-response models yields
much improved designs, typically with very high efficiencies. However, in some
experiments exhibiting strong dependence, designs for marginal models may still
be inefficient for conditional modelling. Our asymptotic results provide some
theoretical insights into why such inefficiencies occur.

involves keeping detailed diaries or periodic surveys and is limited in scope
and reach. Alternatively, social media is infamous for allowing its users to
update the world on the minutiae of their daily lives, including their eating
habits. In this work we examine the potential of Twitter to provide insight
into US-wide dietary choices by linking the tweeted dining experiences of 210K
users to their interests, demographics, and social networks. We validate our
approach by relating the caloric values of the foods mentioned in the tweets to
the state-wide obesity rates, achieving a Pearson correlation of 0.77 across
the 50 US states and the District of Columbia. We then build a model to predict
county-wide obesity and diabetes statistics based on a combination of
demographic variables and food names mentioned on Twitter. Our results show
significant improvement over previous CHI research (Culotta'14). We further
link this data to societal and economic factors, such as education and income,
illustrating that, for example, areas with higher education levels tweet about
food that is significantly less caloric. Finally, we address the somewhat
controversial issue of the social nature of obesity (first raised by Christakis
& Fowler in 2007) by inducing two social networks using mentions and reciprocal
following relationships.

reach the steady-state solution may be very long. In this paper we present an
adaptive algorithm to address these two issues. We show that by evaluating the
dominant eigenvalue of a ""partially converged"" steady flow, we can select a

diversity in both continuum levels and line features among these objects. We
use radiative-transfer models that fit the optical part of the spectrum well,
and find that in three of these four events we see a UV continuum flux excess,
apparently unaffected by line absorption. We hypothesize that this emission
originates above the photosphere, and is related to interaction with
circumstel- lar material (CSM) located in close proximity to the SN progenitor.
In contrast, the spectra of SN 2001ig are well fit by single-temperature
models, display weak continuum and strong reverse-fluorescence features, and
are similar to spectra of radioactive 56Ni-dominated Type Ia supernovae. A
comparison of the early shock-cooling components in the observed light curves
with the UV continuum levels which we assume trace the strength of CSM
interaction suggests that events with slower cooling have stronger CSM
emission. The radio emission from events having a prominent UV excess is
perhaps consistent with slower blast-wave velocities, as expected if the
explosion shock was slowed down by the CSM that is also responsible for the
strong UV, but this connection is currently speculative as it is based on only
a few events.

was completely Machian and used both retarded and advanced waves to communicate
gravitational influence between particles. The advanced waves, which travel
backward in time, are difficult to visualize and although they are
mathematically allowed by relativistic wave equations, they never really caught
on. The HN theory reduced to Einstein's theory of gravity in the smooth fluid
approximation and a transformation into the rest frame of the fluid.
Unfortunately the theory has been ignored by much of the General Relativity
community since it was developed with the static universe in mind. However, it
is easy to drop the static universe condition (by dropping the ""C""-field matter
creation terms) and then you have a perfectly good theory of gravitation.
Hawking in 1965 pointed out a possible flaw in the theory. This involved
integrating out into the distant future to account for all the advanced waves
which might influence the mass of a particle here and now. Hawking used
infinity as his upper time limit and showed the integral was divergent. We
would like to point out that since the universe is known to be expanding, and
accelerating, the upper limit in the advanced wave time integral should not be
infinite but is bounded by the Cosmic Event Horizon. This event horizon $H_e$
represents a barrier between future events that can be observed and those which
cannot. We maintain that the advanced integral is in fact finite when the
cosmic event horizon is taken into account, since the upper limit of the
advanced wave integral becomes $H_e/c$. Hawking's objection is no longer valid
and the HN theory becomes a working theory once again.
