collimation of jets and disk winds. The evolution of the disk structure is
consistently taken into account. Extending our earlier studies, we now consider
the self-generation of the magnetic field by an $\alpha^2\Omega$ mean-field
dynamo. The disk magnetization remains on a rather low level, that helps to
evolve the simulations for $T > 10,000$ dynamical time steps on a domain
extending 1500 inner disk radii. We find a magnetic field of the inner disk
similar to the commonly found open field structure, favoring
magneto-centrifugal launching. The outer disk field is highly inclined and
predominantly radial. Here, differential rotation induces a strong toroidal
component that plays a key role in outflow launching. These outflows from the
outer disk are slower, denser, and less collimated. If the dynamo action is not
quenched, magnetic flux is continuously generated, diffuses outward the disk,
and fills the entire disk. We have invented a toy model triggering a
time-dependent mean-field dynamo. The duty cycles of this dynamo lead to
episodic ejections on similar timescales. When the dynamo is suppressed as the
magnetization falls below a critical value, the generation of the outflows and
also accretion is inhibited. The general result is that we can steer episodic
ejection and {\em large-scale jet knots} by a {\em disk-intrinsic dynamo} that
is time-dependent and regenerates the jet-launching magnetic field.

observed in the contact network structure. In particular, the contact network
is strongly shaped by the organization of the offices in departments, which has
consequences in the design of accurate agent-based models of epidemic spread.
We consider the contact network as a potential substrate for infectious disease
spread and show that its sparsity tends to prevent outbreaks of rapidly
spreading epidemics. Moreover, we define three typical behaviors according to
the fraction $f$ of links each individual shares outside its own department:
residents, wanderers and linkers. Linkers ($f\sim 50\%$) act as bridges in the
network and have large betweenness centralities. Thus, a vaccination strategy
targeting linkers efficiently prevents large outbreaks. As such a behavior may
be spotted a priori in the offices' organization or from surveys, without the
full knowledge of the time-resolved contact network, this result may help the
design of efficient, low-cost vaccination or social-distancing strategies.

atmospheres may be affected by ion drag and resistive heating arising from
wind-driven electrodynamics. Recent models of ion drag on these planets,
however, are based on thermal ionization only and do not include the upper
atmosphere above the 1 mbar level. These models are also based on simplified
equations of resistive MHD that are not always valid in extrasolar planet
atmospheres. We show that photoionization dominates over thermal ionization
over much of the dayside atmosphere above the 100 mbar level, creating an upper
ionosphere dominated by ionization of H and He and a lower ionosphere dominated
by ionization of metals such as Na, K, and Mg. The resulting dayside electron
densities on close-in exoplanets are higher than those encountered in any
planetary ionosphere of the solar system, and the conductivities are comparable
to the chromosphere of the Sun. Based on these results and assumed magnetic
fields, we constrain the conductivity regimes on close-in EGPs and use a
generalized Ohm's law to study the basic effects of electrodynamics in their
atmospheres. We find that ion drag is important above the 10 mbar level where
it can also significantly alter the energy balance through resistive heating.
Due to frequent collisions of the electrons and ions with the neutral
atmosphere, however, ion drag is largely negligible in the lower atmosphere
below the 10 mbar level for a reasonable range of planetary magnetic moments

In particular, it allows for in depth comparative analysis of (most of) the
existing types of time consistency -- a feat that has not be possible before
and which is done in the companion paper [BCP2016] to this one. In our approach
the time consistency is studied for a large class of maps that are postulated
to satisfy only two properties -- monotonicity and locality. The time
consistency is defined in terms of an update rule. The form of the update rule
introduced here is novel, and is perfectly suited for developing the unifying
framework that is worked out in this paper. As an illustration of the
applicability of our approach, we show how to recover almost all concepts of
weak time consistency by means of constructing appropriate update rules.

challenges for the electricity grid. For the core problem of power balance, the
legacy paradigm of tailoring supply to follow random demand may be
inappropriate under deep penetration of uncertain and intermittent renewable
generation. In this situation, there is an emerging consensus that the
alternative approach of controlling demand to follow random supply offers
compelling economic benefits in terms of reduced regulation costs. This
approach exploits the flexibility of demand side resources and requires
sensing, actuation, and communication infrastructure; distributed control
algorithms; and viable schemes to compensate participating loads. This paper
considers rate-constrained energy services which are a specific paradigm for
flexible demand. These services are characterized by a specified delivery
window, the total amount of energy that must be supplied over this window, and
the maximum rate at which this energy may be delivered. We consider a forward
market where rate-constrained energy services are traded. We explore allocation
policies and market decisions of a supplier in this market. The supplier owns a
generation mix that includes some uncertain renewable generation and may also
purchase energy in day-ahead and real-time markets to meet customer demand. The
supplier must optimally select the portfolio of rate-constrained services to
sell, the amount of day-ahead energy to buy, and the policies for making
real-time energy purchases and allocations to customers to maximize its
expected profit. We offer solutions to the supplier's decision and control
problems to economically provide rate constrained energy services.

that gating shifts the charge carriers near the NW surface, surface roughness
scattering is not strong enough to degrade the transport properties of the

nature of the dark energy component of the universe still lags well behind the
astounding experimental evidence achieved from the increasingly sophisticated
observational tools at our disposal. While the canonical possibility is a
strict cosmological constant, or rigid vacuum energy density
$\rho_{\Lambda}=$const., the exceeding simplicity of this possibility lies also
at the root of its unconvincing theoretical status, as there is no explanation
for the existence of such constant for the entire cosmic history. Herein we
explore general models of the vacuum energy density slowly evolving with the
Hubble function $H$ and/or its time derivative, $\rho_{\Lambda}(H,\dot{H})$.
Some of these models are actually well-motivated from the theoretical point of
view and may provide a rich phenomenology that could be explored in future
observations, whereas some others have more limitations. In this work, we put
them to the test and elucidate which ones are still compatible with the present
observations and which ones are already ruled out. We consider their
implications on structure formation, in combination with data on type Ia
supernovae, the Cosmic Microwave Background, the Baryonic Acoustic
Oscillations, and the predicted redshift distribution of cluster-size collapsed
structures. The relation of these vacuum models on possible evidence of
dynamical dark energy recently pointed out in the literature is also briefly
addressed.

culminating in nitric acid rainout. These effects are also expected after
nearby supernovae and extreme solar proton events. In this work we considered
specifically whether the increased nitric acid rainout from such events is a
threat to modern terrestrial ecosystems. We also considered its potential
benefit to early terrestrial Paleozoic ecosystems. We used established critical
loads for nitrogen deposition in ecoregions of Europe and the US and compared
them with previously predicted values of nitric acid rainout from a typical GRB
within our galaxy. The predicted rainout was found to be too low to harm modern
ecosystems, however, it is large compared with probable nitrate flux onto land
prior to the invasion of plants. We suggest that this flux may have contributed
nutrients to this invasion if, as hypothesized, the end-Ordovician extinction
event were initiated by a GRB or other ionizing radiation event.

evolution, we discuss the evolution and nucleosynthesis of very massive stars
(VMS: M>100 solar masses) in the context of recent stellar evolution model
calculations. This chapter covers the following aspects: general properties,
evolution of surface properties, late central evolution, and nucleosynthesis
including their dependence on metallicity, mass loss and rotation. Since very
massive stars have very large convective cores during the main-sequence phase,
their evolution is not so much affected by rotational mixing, but more by mass
loss through stellar winds. Their evolution is never far from a homogeneous
evolution even without rotational mixing. All VMS at metallicities close to
solar end their life as WC(-WO) type Wolf-Rayet stars. Due to very important
mass loss through stellar winds, these stars may have luminosities during the
advanced phases of their evolution similar to stars with initial masses between
60 and 120 solar masses. A distinctive feature which may be used to disentangle
Wolf-Rayet stars originating from VMS from those originating from lower initial
masses is the enhanced abundances of neon and magnesium at the surface of WC
stars. At solar metallicity, mass loss is so strong that even if a star is born
with several hundred solar masses, it will end its life with less than 50 solar
masses (using current mass loss prescriptions). At the metallicity of the LMC
and lower, on the other hand, mass loss is weaker and might enable star to
undergo pair-instability supernovae.

Here we show that the application of a magnetic field can induce SDW magnetic

magnetic neutron scattering to show that the application of a large (~8T)

buried under Standard Model backgrounds. Prospects for detecting higgsino pair
production via events with monojets or mono-photons from initial state
radiation are also bleak because of signal-to-background rates typically at the

emitted from a low-pressure/high-mass component traced by the low-J lines and a
high-pressure/low-mass component which dominates the luminosity. We found that,
on average, the ratios of the warm/cool pressure, mass, and 12CO luminosity are
60 +/- 30, 0.11 +/- 0.02, and 15.6 +/- 2.7. The gas-to-dust-mass ratios are <

formation. The conditions necessary to produce LGRBs can affect the relation
between the LGRB rate and star formation. By using the power of a complete LGRB
sample, our aim is to understand whether such a bias exists and, if it does,
what is its origin. In this first paper, we build the SED of the z<1 host
galaxies of the BAT6 LGRB sample, and determine their stellar masses from SED
fitting. We compare the resulting stellar mass distribution (i) with
star-forming galaxies observed in deep surveys (UltraVISTA); (ii) with
semi-analitical models of the z<1 star forming galaxy population and (iii) with
numerical simulations of LGRB hosts having different metallicity thresholds for
the progenitor star environment. We find that at z<1 LGRBs tend to avoid
massive galaxies and are powerful in selecting faint low-mass star-forming
galaxies. The stellar mass distribution of the hosts is not consistent with
that of the UltraVISTA star-forming galaxies weighted for their SFR. This
implies that, at least at z<1, LGRBs are not unbiased tracers of star
formation. To make the two distributions consistent, a much steeper faint-end
of the mass function would be required, or a very shallow SFR-Mass relation for
the low mass galaxy population. GRB host galaxy simulations indicates that, to
reproduce the stellar mass distribution, a metallicity threshold of the order
of Z_th=0.3-0.5Z_sun is necessary. Models without a metallicity threshold or
with an extreme threshold of Z_th = 0.1Z_sun are excluded at z<1. The use of
the BAT6 complete sample makes this result not affected by possible biases
which could have influenced past results based on incomplete samples. The
preference for low metallicities (Z<~0.5Z_sun) can be a consequence of the
particular conditions needed for the progenitor star to produce a GRB.

surface brightness of $\mu_g \sim 32$ mag arcsec$^{-2}$ and show they have much
larger extents ($\sim5$ kpc radii) than previously recognised. While NGC185
retains a regular shape in its peripheral regions, NGC147 exhibits pronounced
isophotal twisting due to the emergence of symmetric tidal tails. We fit single
Sersic models to composite surface brightness profiles constructed from diffuse
light and star counts and find that NGC147 has an effective radius almost 3
times that of NGC185. In both cases, the effective radii that we calculate are
larger by a factor of $\sim2$ compared to most literature values. We also

$M_g=-16.36\pm0.04$ for NGC147. Using photometric metallicities computed for

single cells remains a major challenge. Using a unique combination of
technologies that yields unprecedented statistical precision, we find that the
sizes of individual Caulobacter crescentus cells increase exponentially in
time. We also establish that they divide upon reaching a critical multiple
($\approx$1.8) of their initial sizes, rather than an absolute size. We show
that when the temperature is varied, the growth and division timescales scale
proportionally with each other over the physiological temperature range.
Strikingly, the cell-size and division-time distributions can both be rescaled
by their mean values such that the condition-specific distributions collapse to
universal curves. We account for these observations with a minimal stochastic
model that is based on an autocatalytic cycle. It predicts the scalings, as
well as specific functional forms for the universal curves. Our experimental
and theoretical analysis reveals a simple physical principle governing these
complex biological processes: a single temperature-dependent scale of cellular
time governs the stochastic dynamics of growth and division in balanced growth
conditions.

provides an unprecedented view of the rest-frame optical spectra of a
representative sample of distant star-forming galaxies. We investigate the
locations of z~2.3 MOSDEF galaxies in multiple emission-line diagnostic
diagrams. These include the [OIII]/Hb vs. [NII]/Ha and [OIII]/Hb vs. [SII]/Ha
""BPT"" diagrams, as well as the O_32 vs. R_23 excitation diagram. We recover the
well-known offset in the star-forming sequence of high-redshift galaxies in the
[OIII]/Hb vs. [NII]/Ha BPT diagram relative to SDSS star-forming galaxies.
However, the shift for our rest-frame optically selected sample is less
significant than for rest-frame-UV selected and emission-line selected galaxies
at z~2. Furthermore, we find that the offset is mass-dependent, only appearing
within the low-mass half of the z~2.3 MOSDEF sample, where galaxies are shifted
towards higher [NII]/Ha at fixed [OIII]/Hb. Within the [OIII]/Hb vs. [SII]/Ha

local ones, and therefore attribute the shift in the [OIII]/Hb vs. [NII]/Ha BPT
diagram to elevated N/O abundance ratios among lower-mass (M_*<10^10 M_sun)
high-redshift galaxies. The variation in N/O ratios calls into question the use
at high redshift of oxygen abundance indicators based on nitrogen lines, but
the apparent invariance with redshift of the excitation sequence in the O_32
vs. R_23 diagram paves the way for using the combination of O_32 and R_23 as an
unbiased metallicity indicator over a wide range in redshift. This indicator
will allow for an accurate characterization of the shape and normalization of

large aperture space and ground-based telescopes such as the James Webb Space
Telescope (JWST) and the European Extremely Large Telescope (E-ELT). These
facilities will be powerful tools for characterizing transiting exoplanets, but
only after a considerable amount of telescope time is devoted to a single
planet. A technique that could provide a relatively rapid means of identifying
haze-free targets (which may be more valuable targets for characterization)
could potentially increase the science return for these telescopes. Our
proposed method utilizes broadband observations of refracted light in the
out-of-transit spectrum. Light refracted through an exoplanet atmosphere can
lead to an increase of flux prior to ingress and subsequent to egress. Because
this light is transmitted at pressures greater than those for typical cloud and
haze layers, the detection of refracted light could indicate a cloud- or
haze-free atmosphere. A detection of refracted light could be accomplished in
<10 hours for Jovian exoplanets with JWST and <5 hours for
Super-Earths/Mini-Neptunes with E-ELT. We find that this technique is most
effective for planets with equilibrium temperatures between 200 and 500 K,
which may include potentially habitable planets. A detection of refracted light
for a potentially habitable planet would strongly suggest the planet was free
of a global cloud or haze layer, and therefore a promising candidate for
follow-up observations.

immediately before the turnaround the universe is dominated by the linear

Thus a single, technically natural choice for the slope ensures that the

resolved via the gauging of a Peccei-Quinn axion shift symmetry. The theory
describes an inflationary transition from de Sitter to flat Minkowski space,
very similar to the Starobinsky inflationary model. The extension to metastable
de Sitter superstring vacua is also investigated. The scalar manifold is
extended to a much richer manifold, but it contains always ${\cal M}_n$ as a
sub-manifold. In superstrings the metastability is induced by axions that cure

paper is to show that in many contexts, surgery on transverse knots is more
natural than surgery on Legendrian knots.
  Besides reinterpreting surgery on Legendrian knots in terms of transverse
knots, our main results on are in two complementary directions: conditions
under which inadmissible transverse surgery (\textit{cf.\@} positive contact
surgery on Legendrian knots) preserves tightness, and conditions under which it
creates overtwistedness. In the first direction, we give the first result on
the tightness of inadmissible transverse surgery for contact manifolds with
vanishing Heegaard Floer contact invariant. In particular, inadmissible
transverse surgery on the connected binding of a genus $g$ open book that
supports a tight contact structure preserves tightness if the surgery
coefficient is greater than $2g-1$. In the second direction, along with more
general statements, we deduce a partial generalisation to a result of Lisca and
Stipsicz: when $L$ is a Legendrian knot with $tb(L) \leq -2$, and $|rot(L)|
\geq 2g(L)+tb(L)$, then contact $(+1)$-surgery on $L$ is overtwisted.

transport to small scales. Low resolution results in higher radial convective
fluxes of energy and enthalpy, more fully buoyant mass, and stronger neutrino
heating. In the SASI-dominated case, lower resolution damps SASI oscillations.

the data quality. HUGS delivers the deepest and highest quality K-band images
ever collected over areas of cosmological interest, and ideally complements the
CANDELS data set in terms of image quality and depth. The seeing is exceptional
and homogeneous, confined to the range 0.38""-0.43"". In the deepest region of
the GOODS-S field, (which includes most of the HUDF) the K-band exposure time
exceeds 80 hours of integration, yielding a 1-sigma magnitude limit of ~28.0
mag/sqarcsec. In the UDS field the survey matches the shallower depth of the
CANDELS images reaching a 1-sigma limit per sq.arcsec of ~27.3mag in the K band
and ~28.3mag in the Y-band, We show that the HUGS observations are well matched
to the depth of the CANDELS WFC3/IR data, since the majority of even the
faintest galaxies detected in the CANDELS H-band images are also detected in
HUGS. We present the K-band galaxy number counts produced by combining the HUGS
data from the two fields. We show that the slope of the number counts depends

redshift is still the subject of considerable debate. One way to investigate
this puzzling issue is to study the number density of quiescent galaxies at
z~2, and its dependence on mass. Here we present the results of a new study
based on very deep Ks-band imaging (with the HAWK-I instrument on the VLT) of
two HST CANDELS fields (the UKIDSS Ultra-deep survey (UDS) field and
GOODS-South). The new HAWK-I data (taken as part of the HUGS VLT Large Program)
reach detection limits of Ks>26 (AB mag). We select a sample of
passively-evolving galaxies in the redshift range 1.4<z<2.5. Thanks to the
depth and large area coverage of our imaging, we have been able to extend the
selection of quiescent galaxies a magnitude fainter than previous analyses.
Through extensive simulations we demonstrate, for the first time, that the
observed turn-over in the number of quiescent galaxies at K>22 is real. This
has enabled us to establish unambiguously that the number counts of quiescent
galaxies at z~2 flatten and slightly decline at magnitudes fainter than
Ks~22(AB mag.). We show that this trend corresponds to a stellar mass threshold
$M_*10^{10.8}\,{\rm M_{\odot}}$ below which the mechanism that halts the star
formation in high-redshift galaxies seems to be inefficient. Finally we compare
the observed pBzK number counts with those of quiescent galaxies extracted from
four different semi-analytic models. We find that none of the models provides a
statistically acceptable description of the number density of quiescent
galaxies at these redshifts. We conclude that the mass function of quiescent
galaxies as a function of redshift continues to present a key and demanding
challenge for proposed models of galaxy formation and evolution.

quantifying the relationship between an outcome (e.g., disease status) and
connectivity patterns in the brain while reducing spurious correlations through
inclusion of confounding covariates. They also enable prediction about an
outcome based on connectivity structure and vice versa, simulating networks to
gain a better understanding of normal ranges of topological variability, and
thresholding networks leveraging group information. Thus, they provide a

galaxies were recently quenched and backtrack their individual evolving
trajectories on the UVJ color-color plane finding evidence for two distinct
quenching routes. By using sizes measured in the previous paper of this series,
we confirm that the largest galaxies are indeed among the youngest at a given
redshift. This is consistent with some contribution to the apparent growth from
recent arrivals, an effect often called progenitor bias. However, we calculate
that recently-quenched objects can only be responsible for about half the

through a cooperative choice of their own initial opinions. In this endeavor,
the coalition members are assumed to have access to full profile of the

EGC, we establish the existence of a minimum size EGC for an arbitrary
time-varying network; also, we develop a non-trivial set of upper and lower

global consensus without affecting any of the predefined graph interactions,

by measuring the parity-violating elastic scattering asymmetry of
longitudinally polarized electrons from an unpolarized liquid hydrogen target
at small momentum transfer. A custom apparatus was designed for this experiment
to meet the technical challenges presented by the smallest and most precise
${\vec{e}}$p asymmetry ever measured. Technical milestones were achieved at
Jefferson Lab in target power, beam current, beam helicity reversal rate,
polarimetry, detected rates, and control of helicity-correlated beam
properties. The experiment employed 180 microA of 89% longitudinally polarized
electrons whose helicity was reversed 960 times per second. The electrons were
accelerated to 1.16 GeV and directed to a beamline with extensive
instrumentation to measure helicity-correlated beam properties that can induce
false asymmetries. Moller and Compton polarimetry were used to measure the
electron beam polarization to better than 1%. The electron beam was incident on
a 34.4 cm liquid hydrogen target. After passing through a triple collimator
system, scattered electrons between 5.8 degrees and 11.6 degrees were bent in
the toroidal magnetic field of a resistive copper-coil magnet. The electrons
inside this acceptance were focused onto eight fused silica Cerenkov detectors
arrayed symmetrically around the beam axis. A total scattered electron rate of
about 7 GHz was incident on the detector array. The detectors were read out in
integrating mode by custom-built low-noise pre-amplifiers and 18-bit sampling
ADC modules. The momentum transfer Q^2 = 0.025 GeV^2 was determined using
dedicated low-current (~100 pA) measurements with a set of drift chambers
before (and a set of drift chambers and trigger scintillation counters after)
the toroidal magnet.

coupling, while without this coupling TN appeared to be much higher (26 K). For
small or high enough rotomagnetic coupling constant value the antiferromagnetic
phase transition order appeared to be the second or the first order

rotomagnetic coupling along with rotoelectric one opens the additional way to
control the form of the phase diagrams by application of external magnetic or

the main drivers of protoplanetary disk dispersal. The fully or partially
ionized disk surface is expected to produce free-free continuum emission at
centimeter (cm) wavelengths that can be routinely detected with interferometers
such as the upgraded Very Large Array (VLA). We use deep (rms noise down to 8
$\mu$Jy beam$^{-1}$ in the field of view center) 3.5 cm maps of the nearby (130
pc) Corona Australis (CrA) star formation (SF) region to constrain disk
photoevaporation models. We find that the radio emission from disk sources in
CrA is surprisingly faint. Only 3 out of 10 sources within the field of view
are detected, with flux densities of order $10^2$ $\mu$Jy. However, a
significant fraction of their emission is non-thermal. Typical upper limits for
non-detections are $3\sigma\sim 60~\mu$Jy beam$^{-1}$. Assuming analytic
expressions for the free-free emission from extreme-UV (EUV) irradiation, we
derive stringent upper limits to the ionizing photon luminosity impinging on
the disk surface $\Phi_\mathrm{EUV}<1-4\times10^{41}$ s$^{-1}$. These limits
constrain $\Phi_\mathrm{EUV}$ to the low end of the values needed by EUV-driven
photoevaporation models to clear protoplanetary disks in the observed few Myr
timescale. Therefore, at least in CrA, EUV-driven photoevaporation is not
likely to be the main agent of disk dispersal. We also compare the observed
X-ray luminosities $L_X$ of disk sources with models in which photoevaporation
is driven by such photons. Although predictions are less specific than for the
EUV case, most of the observed fluxes (upper limits) are roughly consistent
with the (scaled) predictions. Deeper observations, as well as predictions
spanning a wider parameter space, are needed to properly test X-ray driven
photoevaporation.

high count rates (>100 cts/s) of bright sources may affect the calibration of

corrections related to this effect are then strongly important in the study of
the spectral properties. Tests of these calibrations are more suitable in
sources which spectra are characterised by a large number of discrete features.
Therefore, in this work, we carried out a spectral analysis of the accreting
Neutron Star GX 13+1, which is a dipping source with several narrow absorption
lines and a broad emission line in its spectrum. We tested two different
correction approaches on an XMM-Newton EPIC-pn observation taken in Timing
mode: the standard Rate Dependent CTI (RDCTI or epfast) and the new, Rate
Dependent Pulse Height Amplitude (RDPHA) corrections. We found that, in
general, the two corrections marginally affect the properties of the overall
broadband continuum, while hints of differences in the broad emission line
spectral shape are seen. On the other hand, they are dramatically important for
the centroid energy of the absorption lines. In particular, the RDPHA
corrections provide a better estimate of the spectral properties of these
features than the RDCTI corrections. Indeed the discrete features observed in
the data, applying the former method, are physically more consistent with those
already found in other Chandra and XMM-Newton observations of GX 13+1.

Finite Element (GMsFEM) framework. The main idea of GMsFEM is to approximate
the solution space locally using a few multiscale basis functions. This is
typically achieved by selecting an appropriate snapshot space and a local
spectral decomposition, e.g., the use of oversampled regions in order to
achieve an efficient model reduction. However, the successful construction of
snapshot spaces may be costly if too many local problems need to be solved in
order to obtain these spaces. In this paper, we show that this efficiency can
be achieved using a moderate quantity of local solutions (or snapshot vectors)
with random boundary conditions on oversampled regions with zero forcing.
Motivated by the randomized algorithm presented in [19], we consider a snapshot
space which consists of harmonic extensions of random boundary conditions
defined in a domain larger than the target region. Furthermore, we perform an
eigenvalue decomposition in this small space. We study the application of
randomized sampling for GMsFEM in conjunction with adaptivity, where local
multiscale spaces are adaptively enriched. Convergence analysis is provided. We
present representative numerical results to validate the method proposed.

network where multiple sensors observe the same physical event and transmit
their contaminated observations to a fusion center, with all nodes equipped
with multiple antennae and linear filters. Under the mean square error (MSE)
criterion, the joint beamforming design problem can be formulated as a
nonconvex optimization problem. To attack this problem, various block
coordinate descent (BCD) algorithms are proposed with convergence being
carefully examined. First we propose a two block coordinate descent (2-BCD)
algorithm that iteratively designs all the beamformers and the linear receiver,
where both subproblems are convex and the convergence of limit points to
stationary points is guaranteed. Besides, the thorough solution to optimizing
one single beamformer is given, which, although discussed several times, is
usually incomplete in existing literature. Based on that, multiple block
coordinate descent algorithms are proposed. Solving the joint beamformers'
design by cyclically updating each separate beamformer under the 2-BCD
framework gives birth to a layered BCD algorithm, which guarantees convergence
to stationary points. Besides that, a wide class of multiple BCD algorithms
using the general essentially cyclic updating rule has been studied. As will be
seen, by appropriately adjusting the update of single beamformer, fast
converging, highly efficient and stationary point achieving algorithms can be
obtained. Extensive numerical results are presented to verify our findings.

interstellar gas, and has great potential as a star formation rate (SFR)
tracer. Using the Herschel KINGFISH sample of 46 nearby galaxies, we
investigate the relation of [CII] surface brightness and luminosity with SFR.
We conclude that [CII] can be used for measurements of SFR on both global and
kiloparsec scales in normal star-forming galaxies in the absence of strong
active galactic nuclei (AGN). The uncertainty of the $\Sigma_{\rm
[CII]}-\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$ calibration is $\pm$0.21 dex. The main source of
scatter in the correlation is associated with regions that exhibit warm IR
colors, and we provide an adjustment based on IR color that reduces the
scatter. We show that the color-adjusted $\Sigma_{\rm[CII]}-\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$
correlation is valid over almost 5 orders of magnitude in $\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$,
holding for both normal star-forming galaxies and non-AGN luminous infrared
galaxies. Using [CII] luminosity instead of surface brightness to estimate SFR
suffers from worse systematics, frequently underpredicting SFR in luminous
infrared galaxies even after IR color adjustment (although this depends on the
SFR measure employed). We suspect that surface brightness relations are better
behaved than the luminosity relations because the former are more closely
related to the local far-UV field strength, most likely the main parameter
controlling the efficiency of the conversion of far-UV radiation into gas
heating. A simple model based on Starburst99 population-synthesis code to
connect SFR to [CII] finds that heating efficiencies are $1\%-3\%$ in normal
galaxies.

larger than $\sim$0.2 pc, which are traced by the APEX data, becomes more
complex and diverse the more evolved the star forming region is. On smaller
scales traced by the SMA data, the chemical complexity and diversity increase
up to the hot core stage. In the H II region phase, the SMA spectra resemble
the spectra of the protostellar phase. Either these more complex molecules are
destroyed or their emission is not compact enough to be detected with the SMA.

are the only methods to measure the structure of the white matter in the living
human brain. The diffusion signal has been modelled as the combined
contribution from many individual fascicles of nerve fibers passing through
each location in the white matter. Typically, this is done via basis pursuit,
but estimation of the exact directions is limited due to discretization. The
difficulties inherent in modeling DWI data are shared by many other problems
involving fitting non-parametric mixture models. Ekanadaham et al. proposed an
approach, continuous basis pursuit, to overcome discretization error in the
1-dimensional case (e.g., spike-sorting). Here, we propose a more general
algorithm that fits mixture models of any dimensionality without
discretization. Our algorithm uses the principles of L2-boost, together with
refitting of the weights and pruning of the parameters. The addition of these
steps to L2-boost both accelerates the algorithm and assures its accuracy. We
refer to the resulting algorithm as elastic basis pursuit, or EBP, since it
expands and contracts the active set of kernels as needed. We show that in
contrast to existing approaches to fitting mixtures, our boosting framework (1)
enables the selection of the optimal bias-variance tradeoff along the solution
path, and (2) scales with high-dimensional problems. In simulations of DWI, we
find that EBP yields better parameter estimates than a non-negative least
squares (NNLS) approach, or the standard model used in DWI, the tensor model,
which serves as the basis for diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). We demonstrate
the utility of the method in DWI data acquired in parts of the brain containing
crossings of multiple fascicles of nerve fibers.

provides an important test case for spectral type determination thanks to the
stringent observational constraints on its component stellar masses (i.e., ~0.9
Msun each) as well as on its age (12-21 Myr) and distance (73 pc). Analysis of
the IRTF data indicates that the composite near-IR spectral type for V4046 Sgr

type previously determined from optical spectroscopy. However, the K5+K7

programs. The algorithm design builds on the characterization of the solutions
of the linear program as saddle points of a modified Lagrangian function. We
show that the resulting continuous-time saddle-point algorithm is provably
correct but, in general, not distributed because of a global parameter
associated with the nonsmooth exact penalty function employed to encode the
inequality constraints of the linear program. This motivates the design of a
discontinuous saddle-point dynamics that, while enjoying the same convergence
guarantees, is fully distributed and scalable with the dimension of the
solution vector. We also characterize the robustness against disturbances and
link failures of the proposed dynamics. Specifically, we show that it is
integral-input-to-state stable but not input-to-state stable. The latter fact
is a consequence of a more general result, that we also establish, which states
that no algorithmic solution for linear programming is input-to-state stable
when uncertainty in the problem data affects the dynamics as a disturbance. Our
results allow us to establish the resilience of the proposed distributed
dynamics to disturbances of finite variation and recurrently disconnected
communication among the agents. Simulations in an optimal control application
illustrate the results.

  Players",,,,,"math.PR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We propose a new approach to mean field games with major and minor players.
Our formulation involves a two player game where the optimization of the
representative minor player is standard while the major player faces an
optimization over conditional McKean-Vlasov stochastic differential equations.
The definition of this limiting game is justified by proving that its solution
provides approximate Nash equilibriums for large finite player games. This
proof depends upon the generalization of standard results on the propagation of
chaos to conditional dynamics. Because it is on independent interest, we prove
this generalization in full detail. Using a conditional form of the Pontryagin
stochastic maximum principle (proven in the appendix), we reduce the solution
of the mean field game to a forward-backward system of stochastic differential
equations of the conditional McKean-Vlasov type, which we solve in the Linear
Quadratic setting. We use this class of models to show that Nash equilibriums
in our formulation can be different from those of the formulations contemplated
so far in the literature.

bumps in neural fields with multiple layers. In the absence of noise, each
layer supports a stationary bump. Using linear stability analysis, we show that
delayed coupling between layers causes translating perturbations of the bumps
to decay in the noise-free system. Adding noise to the system causes bumps to
wander as a random walk. However, coupling between layers can reduce the
variability of this stochastic motion by canceling noise that perturbs bumps in
opposite directions. Delays in interlaminar coupling can further reduce
variability, since they couple bump positions to states from the past. We
demonstrate these relationships by deriving an asymptotic approximation for the
effective motion of bumps. This yields a stochastic delay-differential equation
where each delayed term arises from an interlaminar coupling. The impact of
delays is well approximated by using a small delay expansion, which allows us
to compute the effective diffusion in bumps' positions, accurately matching
results from numerical simulations.

three random matrices, L, Z and w to represent subclonal copy numbers (L),

with a realistic LS220 equation of state for a star with compactness 0.26 and
mass 1.98 $M_\odot$, which is representative of the highest reliably determined

with a comparable compactness of 0.25, while for a family of polytropic
equations of state, we obtain solutions with compactness up to 0.21, the
largest compactness that is stable in this family. These compactness values are
significantly higher than any previously published results. We find that
improvements in adapting the computational domain to the neutron star surface

software artifacts, such as a piece of source code, in a large code repository.
This problem has been traditionally addressed through the textual query. In
other words, information retrieval techniques will be exploited based on the
textual similarity between queries and textual representation of software
artifacts, which is generated by collecting words from comments, identifiers,
and descriptions of programs. However, in addition to these semantic
information, there are rich information embedded in source codes themselves.
These source codes, if analyzed properly, can be a rich source for enhancing
the efforts of software artifact retrieval. To this end, in this paper, we
develop a feature extraction method on source codes. Specifically, this method
can capture both the inherent information in the source codes and the semantic
information hidden in the comments, descriptions, and identifiers of the source
codes. Moreover, we design a heterogeneous metric learning approach, which
allows to integrate code features and text features into the same latent
semantic space. This, in turn, can help to measure the artifact similarity by
exploiting the joint power of both code and text features. Finally, extensive
experiments on real-world data show that the proposed method can help to
improve the performances of software artifact retrieval with a significant
margin.

physics is to require the existence of a hidden (dark) sector, which interacts
with the visible one predominantly via gravity. We consider a hidden sector
containing two stable particles charged under an unbroken $U(1)^{'}$ gauge
symmetry, hence featuring dissipative interactions. The massless gauge field
associated with this symmetry, the dark photon, can interact via kinetic mixing
with the ordinary photon. In fact, such an interaction of strength $\epsilon
\sim 10 ^{-9}$ appears to be necessary in order to explain galactic structure.
We calculate the effect of this new physics on Big Bang Nucleosynthesis and its
contribution to the relativistic energy density at Hydrogen recombination. We
then examine the process of dark recombination, during which neutral dark
states are formed, which is important for large-scale structure formation.
Galactic structure is considered next, focussing on spiral and irregular
galaxies. For these galaxies we modelled the dark matter halo (at the current
epoch) as a dissipative plasma of dark matter particles, where the energy lost
due to dissipation is compensated by the energy produced from ordinary
supernovae (the core-collapse energy is transferred to the hidden sector via
kinetic mixing induced processes in the supernova core). We find that such a
dynamical halo model can reproduce several observed features of disk galaxies,
including the cored density profile and the Tully-Fisher relation. We also
discuss how elliptical and dwarf spheroidal galaxies could fit into this
picture. Finally, these analyses are combined to set bounds on the parameter
space of our model, which can serve as a guideline for future experimental

distinct behaviors when the transverse field is either larger or smaller than a

with equal mass and intra-component interaction in optical lattices both in the
presence and absence of a barrier potential (BP). We show that the SF order
parameters obey the two-component nonlinear Schroedinger equation (NLSE) with
not only cubic but also quintic nonlinearity in the vicinity of the first-order
transitions to the Mott insulators with even fillings. In the case of no BP, we
analyze solitary-wave (SW) solutions of the cubic-quintic NLSE. When the SF
state changes from a ground state to a metastable one, a standard dark SW turns
into a bubble-like dark SW, which has a non-vanishing density dip and no pi
phase kink even in the case of a standing SW. It is shown that the former and
latter SW are dynamically unstable against an out-of-phase fluctuation and an
in-phase fluctuation, respectively, and the dynamical instabilities are
weakened when one approaches the transition point. We find that the size and
the inertial mass of the SW diverge at the first-order transition point. We
suggest that the divergence of the inertial mass may be detected through
measurement of the relation between the velocity and the phase jump of the SW.
In the presence of BP, we reveal that when the barrier strength exceeds a
certain critical value, the SF state that was metastable without the barrier is
destabilized towards complete disjunction of the SF. The presence of the
critical BP strength indicates that the strong BP qualitatively changes the
criticality near the metastability limit of the SF state. We derive critical
behaviors of the density, the compressibility, and the critical current near
the metastability limit induced by the BP. It is also found that the relation
between the supercurrent and the phase jump across the BP exhibits a peculiar
behavior, owing to the non-topological nature of the bubble-like SW.

Secondly, we design and apply an extensive and statistically-principled

a methodology for modeling the relationship between search method parameters

perpendicular to the phosphorene surface with direction from the phosphorene to
the TTF molecule, under which the TTF-introduced donor states move closer to

consistent with the inflationary universe scenario and respects the

from a uniform system of translates, generated by a prototype filter, a
non-uniform covering of the frequency axis is obtained by composition with a
warping function. The warping function is a $\mathcal C^1$-diffeomorphism that
determines the frequency progression and can be chosen freely, apart from minor
technical restrictions. The resulting functions are interpreted as filter
frequency responses. Combined with appropriately chosen decimation factors, a
non-uniform analysis filter bank is obtained. Classical Gabor and wavelet
filter banks are special cases of the proposed construction. Beyond the
state-of-the-art, we construct a filter bank adapted to a frequency scale
derived from human auditory perception and families of filter banks that can be
interpreted as an interpolation between linear (Gabor) and logarithmic
(wavelet) frequency scales. We derive straightforward conditions on the
prototype filter decay and the decimation factors, such that the resulting
warped filter bank forms a frame. In particular, a simple and constructive
method for obtaining tight frames with bandlimited filters is derived by
invoking previous results on generalized shift-invariant systems.

MDVs of weight 11 enter the renormalization of the standard model of particle
physics at 7 loops, via a counterterm for the self-coupling of the Higgs boson.
A recent evaluation by Erik Panzer exhibited the alarming primes 50909 and
121577 in the denominators of rational coefficients that reduce this
counterterm to a Lyndon basis suggested by ideas from Pierre Deligne. Oliver
Schnetz has studied this problem, using a method from Francis Brown. This gave
2111, 14929, 24137, 50909 and 121577 as factors of the denominator of the
coefficient of $\pi^{11}/\sqrt{3}$. Here I construct a basis such that no
denominator prime greater than 3 appears in the result. This is achieved by
building a datamine of 13,369,520 rational coefficients, with tame
denominators, for the the reductions of 118,097 MDVs with weights up to 11.
Then numerical data for merely 53 primitives enables very fast evaluation of
all of these MDVs to 20000 digits. In the course of this Aufbau, six
conjectures for MDVs are formulated and stringently tested.

interaction between them. Thus a measurement of the structure growth, e.g.,
redshift-space distortions (RSD), can provide a powerful tool to constrain the
interacting dark energy (IDE) models. For the widely studied $Q=3\beta
H\rho_{de}$ model, previous works showed that only a very small coupling
($\beta\sim\mathcal{O}(10^{-3})$) can survive in current RSD data. However, all
these analyses had to assume $w>-1$ and $\beta>0$ due to the existence of the
large-scale instability in the IDE scenario. In our recent work [Phys. Rev. D
90, 063005 (2014)], we successfully solved this large-scale instability problem
by establishing a parametrized post-Friedmann (PPF) framework for the IDE
scenario. So we, for the first time, have the ability to explore the full
parameter space of the IDE models. In this work, we reexamine the observational
constraints on the $Q=3\beta H\rho_{de}$ model within the PPF framework. By
using the Planck data, the baryon acoustic oscillation data, the JLA sample of
supernovae, and the Hubble constant measurement, we get
$\beta=-0.010^{+0.037}_{-0.033}$ ($1\sigma$). The fit result becomes
$\beta=-0.0148^{+0.0100}_{-0.0089}$ ($1\sigma$) once we further incorporate the
RSD data in the analysis. The error of $\beta$ is substantially reduced with
the help of the RSD data. Compared with the previous results, our results show
that a negative $\beta$ is favored by current observations, and a relatively
larger interaction rate is permitted by current RSD data.

given such as 18O + 184W and 16O + 148,152Sm where the expected rise above
Rutherford scattering due to Coulomb-nuclear interference is damped by coupling
to the target excited states, and the extreme case of 11Li scattering, where
coupling to the 9Li + n + n continuum leads to an elastic scattering shape that
cannot be reproduced by any standard optical model parameter set. The recent
availability of high quality 6He, 11Li and 11Be data provides further examples
of the influence that coupling effects can have on elastic scattering.
Conditions for strong projectile-target coupling effects are presented with
special emphasis on the importance of the beam-target charge combination being
large enough to bring about the strong coupling effects. Several measurements
are proposed that can lead to further understanding of strong coupling effects
by both inelastic excitation and nucleon transfer on near-barrier elastic
scattering. A final note on the anomalous nature of 8B elastic scattering is
presented as it possesses a more or less normal Fresnel scattering shape
whereas one would a priori not expect this due to the very low breakup
threshold of 8B. The special nature of 11Li is presented as it is predicted
that no matter how far above the Coulomb barrier the elastic scattering is
measured, its shape will not appear as Fresnel like whereas the elastic
scattering of all other loosely bound nuclei studied to date should eventually
do so as the incident energy is increased, making both 8B and 11Li truly

The assemblies greatly eliminate displacement of the outgoing microwave caused

refractive index under the microwave. CGC material shows a considerable
refractive ability. SGC material and PS show little refractive ability. The

states of cells related by descent. Therefore, a phenotypic snapshot of a
collection of cells with known genealogical structure, contains information on
phenotypic dynamics. Here we use a model of phenotypic dynamics on a
genealogical tree to define an inference method which allows to extract an
approximate probabilistic description of phenotypic dynamics based on measured
correlations as a function of the degree of kinship. The approach is tested and
validated on the example of Pyoverdine dynamics in P. aeruginosa colonies.
Interestingly, we find that correlations among pairs and triples of distant
relatives have a simple but non-trivial structure indicating that observed
phenotypic dynamics on the genealogical tree is approximately conformal - a
symmetry characteristic of critical behavior in physical systems. Proposed
inference method is sufficiently general to be applied in any system where

carbon-based material from natural bio-precursor which shows at least moderate
hydrogen storage at room temperature. For this purpose, hydrogenation
characteristics of carbon derived from solid endosperm of coconut is studied.
Solid endosperm and its carbonized version have a native grown distribution of
light elements like K (from KCl), Na, Mg, etc. The hydrogen storage
measurements reveal that the as synthesized materials have good hydrogen
adsorption and desorption capacity with fast kinetics. The synthesized material
adsorbs 2.30 wt. % at room temperature and 8.00 wt.% at liquid nitrogen

Then (the law of) $X$ is called a fixed point of the multivariate smoothing

$m$ is introduced, such that the existence of $\alpha \in (0,1]$ with
$m(\alpha)=1$ and $m'(\alpha) \le 0$ guarantees the existence of nontrivial
fixed points. We prove the uniqueness of fixed points in the critical case
$m'(\alpha)=0$ and describe their tail behavior. This complements recent

multivariate analogue of the derivative martingale and prove its convergence to

transition below 140 K with simultaneous development of long range
ferromagnetic ordering from the high temperature paramagnetic phase. The
undoped compound MnNiGe has an antiferromagnetic ground state and it shows
martensitic like structural instability well above room temperature. Fe doping
at the Mn site not only brings down the martensitic transition temperature, it
also induces ferromagnetism in the sample. Our study brings out two important
aspects regarding the sample, namley (i) the observation of exchange bias at
low temperature, and (ii) spin glass like ground state which prevails below the
martensitic and magnetic transition points. In addition to the observed usual
relaxation behavior the spin glass state is confirmed by zero field cooled
memory experiment, thereby indicating cooperative freezing of spin and/or spin
clusters rather than uncorrelated dynamics of superparamagnetic like spin
clusters. We believe that doping disorder can give rise to some islands of
antiferromagnetic clusters in the otherwise ferromagnetic background which can
produce interfacial frustration and exchange pinning responsible for spin glass

investigate multiple stellar populations in NGC6266 and infer their relative
helium abundance. This cluster is an ideal target to investigate the possible
connection between helium, cluster mass, and HB morphology, as it exhibits an
extended HB and is among the ten more luminous GCs in the Milky Way. The
analysis of color-magnitude diagrams from multi-wavelength photometry reveals
that also NGC6266, similarly to other massive GCs, hosts a double main sequence
(MS), with the red and the blue component made up of the 79+-1% and the 21+-1%
of stars, respectively. The red MS is consistent with a stellar population with
primordial helium while the blue MS is highly helium-enhanced by Delta
Y=0.08+-0.01. Furthermore, the red MS exhibits an intrinsic broadening that can
not be attributed to photometric errors only and is consistent with a spread in
helium of ~0.025 dex. The comparison between NGC6266 and other GCs hosting
helium-enriched stellar populations supports the presence of a correlation
among helium variations, cluster mass, and HB extension.

(SOM), one with respect to the planet's circumstellar orbit and one with
respect to the planetary rotation. Our simulations show that the required
measurements will be possible with the European Extremely Large Telescope
(E-ELT). The first method relies on mutual planet-moon events during stellar
transits. Eclipses with the moon passing behind (in front of) the planet will
be late (early) with regard to the moon's mean orbital period due to the finite
speed of light. This ""transit timing dichotomy"" (TTD) determines an exomoon's
SOM with respect to the circumstellar motion. For the ten largest moons in the
solar system, TTDs range between 2 and 12 s. The E-ELT will enable such
measurements for Earth-sized moons around nearby stars. The second method
measures distortions in the IR spectrum of the rotating giant planet when it is
transited by its moon. This Rossiter-McLaughlin effect (RME) in the planetary
spectrum reveals the angle between the planetary equator and the moon's
circumplanetary orbital plane, and therefore unveils the moon's SOM with
respect to the planet's rotation. A reasonably large moon transiting a directly
imaged planet like beta Pic b causes an RME amplitude of almost 100 m/s, about
twice the stellar RME amplitude of the transiting exoplanet HD209458b. Both new
methods can be used to probe the origin of exomoons, that is, whether they are
regular or irregular in nature.

store a large amount of data while ensuring that data is retrievable in case of
node failure. The study of such systems, particularly the design of storage
codes over finite fields, assumes that the physical channel through which the
nodes communicate is error-free. This is not always the case, for example, in a
wireless storage system.
  We study the probability that a subpacket is repaired incorrectly during node
repair in a distributed storage system, in which the nodes communicate over an
AWGN or Rayleigh fading channels. The asymptotic probability (as SNR increases)
that a node is repaired incorrectly is shown to be completely determined by the
repair locality of the DSS and the symbol error rate of the wireless channel.
Lastly, we propose some design criteria for physical layer coding in this
scenario, and use it to compute optimally rotated QAM constellations for use in
wireless distributed storage systems.

that supports their views and eschew information that conflicts with their
beliefs, and that has negative consequences on our society. Few researchers
have recently found counter evidence of selective exposure in social media:
users are exposed to politically diverse articles. No work has looked at what
happens after exposure, particularly how individuals react to such exposure,
though. Users might well be exposed to diverse articles but share only the
partisan ones. To test this, we study partisan sharing on Facebook: the
tendency for users to predominantly share like-minded news articles and avoid
conflicting ones. We verified four main hypotheses. That is, whether partisan
sharing: 1) exists at all; 2) changes across individuals (e.g., depending on
their interest in politics); 3) changes over time (e.g., around elections); and
4) changes depending on perceived importance of topics. We indeed find strong
evidence for partisan sharing. To test whether it has any consequence in the
real world, we built a web application for BBC viewers of a popular political
program, resulting in a controlled experiment involving more than 70
individuals. Based on what they share and on survey data, we find that partisan
sharing has negative consequences: distorted perception of reality. However, we
do also find positive aspects of partisan sharing: it is associated with people
who are more knowledgeable about politics and engage more with it as they are
more likely to vote in the general elections.

that arises whenever tasks need to be performed by authorized users, subject to

constraints are satisfied.
  The WSP is, in fact, the conservative Constraint Satisfaction Problem (i.e.,
for each variable, here called task, we have a unary authorization constraint)
and is, thus, NP-complete. It was observed by Wang and Li (2010) that the
number k of tasks is often quite small and so can be used as a parameter, and
several subsequent works have studied the parameterized complexity of WSP
regarding parameter k.
  We take a more detailed look at the kernelization complexity of WSP(\Gamma)
when \Gamma\ denotes a finite or infinite set of allowed constraints. Our main
result is a dichotomy for the case that all constraints in \Gamma\ are regular:
(1) We are able to reduce the number n of users to n' <= k. This entails a
kernelization to size poly(k) for finite \Gamma, and, under mild technical
conditions, to size poly(k+m) for infinite \Gamma, where m denotes the number
of constraints. (2) Already WSP(R) for some R \in \Gamma\ allows no polynomial
kernelization in k+m unless the polynomial hierarchy collapses.

in terms of invariants under U(2) rotations among the two SU(2) Higgs doublet
fields. In order to design a strategy for measuring the invariants we express
them in terms of observables, i.e., masses and couplings of scalar bosons. We
find amplitudes directly sensitive to the invariants. Observation of the
Standard-Model-like Higgs boson at the LHC severely constrains the models. In
particular, in the model with Z_2 symmetry imposed on dimension-4 terms (in
order to eliminate tree-level flavour-changing neutral currents), CP violation
is strongly suppressed. On the other hand, the most general Two-Higgs-Doublet
model (without Z_2 symmetry) would still allow for CP violation to be present
in the model, without being in conflict with the LHC data. Consequently, also
flavour-changing neutral currents would in general be expected. We briefly
sketch a strategy for measuring the remaining CP violation.

values of first five electron attached states of the DNA and RNA nucleobases
and only the first electron attached state is found to be energetically
accessible in gas phase. An analysis of the natural orbitals shows that the
first electron attached states of uracil and thymine are valence-bound type and
undergo significant structural changes on attachment of excess electron, which
is reflected in the deviation of the adiabatic electron affinity from the
vertical one. On the other hand, the first electron attached state of cytosine,
adenine and guanine are dipole-bound type and their structure remain unaffected
on attachment of an extra electron, which results in small deviation of
adiabatic electron affinity from that of the vertical one. Vertical and
adiabatic electron affinity values of all the DNA and RNA nucleobases are
negative implying that the first electron attached state are not stable, but
rather resonance states. Previously, reported theoretical studies had shown
scattered results for electron affinities of DNA and RNA bases, with large
deviations from experimental values. Our EOMCC computed values are in very good
agreement with experimental values and can be used as a reliable benchmark for
calibrating new theoretical methods.

data, we examined national socioeconomic, demographic, and agricultural
production data, and local demographic and geographic variables to assess
multilevel forces driving significant local forest cover loss and gain outside
protected areas during the first decade of this century. Because the processes
that drive forest cover loss and gain are expected to be different, we
constructed models of change in each direction. Although forest cover change
varied by country, national level population change was the strongest driver of
forest loss rate for all countries, with a population doubling predicted to
cause 2.06 percent annual cover loss, while doubling tea production was
predicted to cause 1.90 percent. The rate of forest cover gain was associated
positively with increased production of the local staple crop cassava, but
negatively with local population density and meat production, suggesting
production drivers at multiple levels mitigate reforestation. We found a small,
but significant, decrease of forest cover loss rate with increasing distance
from protected areas, supporting studies suggesting higher rates of landscape
change near protected areas. While local population density mitigated the rate
of forest cover gain, cover loss also correlated to lower local population
density, an apparent paradox, but consistent with findings that larger scale
forces outweigh local drivers of deforestation. This implicates demographic and
market forces at national and international scales as critical drivers of
change, calling into question the necessary scale of forest protection policy
in this biodiversity hotspot.

when a justification is stronger than another. Finally, for programs with

functional theory (DFT) calculations can provide valuable insight about these
interactions, traditional DFT approaches with local exchange-correlation
functionals suffer from a poor description of non-bonding van der Waals (vdW)
interactions. We examine here the contribution of vdW forces to the interaction
of small organic molecules (methane, methanol, formic acid and glycine) with
the TiO2 (110) surface, based on DFT calculations with the optB88-vdW
functional. The adsorption geometries and energies at different configurations
were also obtained in the standard generalized gradient approximation (GGA-PBE)
for comparison. We find that the optB88-vdW consistently gives shorter surface
adsorbate-to-surface distances and slightly stronger interactions than PBE for
the weak (physisorbed) modes of adsorption. In the case of strongly adsorbed
(chemisorbed) molecules both functionals give similar results for the
adsorption geometries, and also similar values of the relative energies between
different chemisorption modes for each molecule. In particular both functionals
predict that dissociative adsorption is more favourable than molecular
adsorption for methanol, formic acid and glycine, in general agreement with
experiment. The dissociation energies obtained from both functionals are also
very similar, indicating that vdW interactions do not affect the thermodynamics
of surface deprotonation. However, the optB88-vdW always predicts stronger
adsorption than PBE. The comparison of the methanol adsorption energies with
values obtained from a Redhead analysis of temperature programmed desorption
data suggests that optB88-vdW significantly overestimates the adsorption
strength, although we warn about the uncertainties involved in such
comparisons.

function for an erasure coded distributed data storage system under worst case
conditions. Data loss in an erasure coded system depends on probability
distributions for the disk repair duration and the disk failure duration. In
previous works, the data loss probability of such systems has been studied
under the assumption of exponentially distributed disk failure and disk repair
durations, using well-known analytic methods from the theory of Markov
processes. These methods lead to an estimate of the integral of the reliability
function.
  Here, we address the problem of directly calculating the data loss
probability for general repair and failure duration distributions. A closed
limiting form is developed for the probability of data loss and it is shown
that the probability of the event that a repair duration exceeds a failure
duration is sufficient for characterizing the data loss probability.
  For the case of constant repair duration, we develop an expression for the
conditional data loss probability given the number of failures experienced by a
each node in a given time window. We do so by developing a geometric approach
that relies on the computation of volumes of a family of polytopes that are
related to the code. An exact calculation is provided and an upper bound on the
data loss probability is obtained by posing the problem as a set avoidance

introduced in order to apply a discontinuous high-order method for large scale
engineering applications involving discontinuities in the flows with complex
geometries. In the proposed hybrid approach, the finite volume (FV) element,
consisting of structured FV subcells, is embedded in the base hexahedral
element containing discontinuity, and an FV based high-order shock-capturing
scheme is employed to overcome the Gibbs phenomena. Thus, a discontinuity is
captured at the resolution of FV subcells within an embedded FV element. In the
smooth flow region, the SD element is used in the base hexahedral element.
Then, the governing equations are solved by the SD method. The SD method is
chosen for its low numerical dissipation and computational efficiency
preserving high-order accurate solutions. The coupling between the SD element
and the FV element is achieved by the globally conserved mortar method. In this
paper, the 5th-order WENO scheme with the characteristic decomposition is
employed as the shock-capturing scheme in the embedded FV element, and the
5th-order SD method is used in the smooth flow field.
  The order of accuracy study and various 1D and 2D test cases are carried out,

the proposed hybrid method results in comparable or better simulation results

similar luminosity, while the giant galaxies clearly segregate into
star-forming spirals and passive lenticulars. We therefore suggest that the

reflect the observational differences based on luminosity and surface
brightness among the apparent distinct classes, rather than any physical

increase in amplitude with subhalo mass (in the range of $10^{10} - 6.0\times

reasonable agreement with SDSS LRG measurements and that decreases in amplitude

the intrinsic alignments of centrals and satellites, with clear detection of
satellite radial alignments within their host halos. Finally, we show that

the latter becomes non-decaying as the junction approaches perfect Andreev
reflection, thus resulting in a Majorana dark state (MDS) localised at the NS
junction. We show that MDSs exhibit the full range of properties associated to
conventional closed-system Majorana bound states (zero-energy,
self-conjugation, $4\pi$-Josephson effect and non-Abelian braiding statistics),
while not requiring topological superconductivity.

  with Mutual Information Measure","IEEETrans On Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence",,,,"cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Feature subset selection, as a special case of the general subset selection
problem, has been the topic of a considerable number of studies due to the
growing importance of data-mining applications. In the feature subset selection
problem there are two main issues that need to be addressed: (i) Finding an
appropriate measure function than can be fairly fast and robustly computed for
high-dimensional data. (ii) A search strategy to optimize the measure over the
subset space in a reasonable amount of time. In this article mutual information
between features and class labels is considered to be the measure function. Two
series expansions for mutual information are proposed, and it is shown that
most heuristic criteria suggested in the literature are truncated
approximations of these expansions. It is well-known that searching the whole
subset space is an NP-hard problem. Here, instead of the conventional
sequential search algorithms, we suggest a parallel search strategy based on
semidefinite programming (SDP) that can search through the subset space in
polynomial time. By exploiting the similarities between the proposed algorithm
and an instance of the maximum-cut problem in graph theory, the approximation
ratio of this algorithm is derived and is compared with the approximation ratio
of the backward elimination method. The experiments show that it can be
misleading to judge the quality of a measure solely based on the classification
accuracy, without taking the effect of the non-optimum search strategy into
account.

second generalization: a family of update rules which possess different
equilibrium properties. Subsequently, we investigate models in which a external

cases where this external force can introduce additional agents and cases where
they can modify the cost structures for other agents. We describe and analyze
some strategies through which such modulation may be possible in an

standard cost function. The HR calculus is a convenient way to calculate formal
derivatives of both analytic and non-analytic functions of quaternion
variables, however, both the HR and other functional calculus in quaternion
analysis have encountered an essential technical obstacle, that is, the
traditional product rule is invalid due to the non- commutativity of the
quaternion algebra. To address this issue, a generalized form of the HR
derivative is proposed based on a general orthogonal system. The so introduced
generalization, called the generalized HR (GHR) calculus, encompasses not just
the left- and right-hand versions of quaternion derivative, but also enables
solutions to some long standing problems, such as the novel product rule, the
chain rule, the mean-valued theorem and Taylor's theorem. At the core of the
proposed approach is the quaternion rotation, which can naturally be applied to
other functional calculi in non-commutative settings. Examples on using the GHR
