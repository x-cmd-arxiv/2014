pure-state limit. The definite process that takes place in the apparatus may
either be intrinsically random or be explainable from a deeper theory. While
the first scenario is the standard lore, the latter implies that quantum
mechanics is emergent. In that case, it is likely that one has to reconsider
radiation by accelerated charges as a physical effect, which thus must be
compensated by an energy input. Stochastic electrodynamics, for example,
asserts that the vacuum energy arises from classical fluctuations with energy
$\frac{1}{2}\hbar\omega$ per mode. In such theories the stability of the
hydrogen ground state will arise from energy input from fluctuations and output
by radiation, hence due to an energy throughput. That flux of energy
constitutes an arrow of time, which we call the ""subquantum arrow of time"". It
is related to the stability of matter and it is more fundamental than, e.g.,
the thermodynamic and cosmological arrows.

  April (2014)","10.1007/s40590-014-0008-8",,"nlin.PS cond-mat.stat-mech","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A numerical study of the role of anomalous diffusion in front propagation in
reaction-diffusion systems is presented. Three models of anomalous diffusion
are considered: fractional diffusion, tempered fractional diffusion, and a
model that combines fractional diffusion and regular diffusion. The reaction
kinetics corresponds to a Fisher-Kolmogorov nonlinearity. The numerical method
is based on a finite-difference operator splitting algorithm with an explicit
Euler step for the time advance of the reaction kinetics, and a Crank-Nicholson
semi-implicit time step for the transport operator. The anomalous diffusion
operators are discretized using an upwind, flux-conserving, Grunwald-Letnikov
finite-difference scheme applied to the regularized fractional derivatives.
With fractional diffusion of order $\alpha$, fronts exhibit exponential
acceleration, $a_L(t) \sim e^{\gamma t/\alpha}$, and develop algebraic decaying
tails, $\phi \sim 1/x^{\alpha}$. In the case of tempered fractional diffusion,
this phenomenology prevails in the intermediate asymptotic regime
  $\left(\chi t \right)^{1/\alpha} \ll x \ll 1/\lambda$, where $1/\lambda$ is
the scale of the tempering. Outside this regime, i.e. for $x > 1/\lambda$, the
tail exhibits the tempered decay $\phi \sim e^{-\lambda x}/x^{\alpha+1}$, and
the front velocity approaches the terminal speed $v_*=
\left(\gamma-\lambda^\alpha \chi\right)/ \lambda$. Of particular interest is
the study of the interplay of regular and fractional diffusion. It is shown
that the main role of regular diffusion is to delay the onset of front
acceleration. In particular, the crossover time, $t_c$, to transition to the
accelerated fractional regime exhibits a logarithmic scaling of the form $t_c
\sim \log \left(\chi_d/\chi_f\right)$ where $\chi_d$ and $\chi_f$ are the
regular and fractional diffusivities.

corresponding scattering lengths and compare them to the existing predictions
from a $\mathcal{O}(p^3)$ chiral perturbation theory study. In addition, we
estimate the effects of the next-to-leading-order potentials by adopting
heavy-meson Lagrangians and fixing the relevant low-energy constants using
either symmetry or naturalness arguments. It is shown that higher-order
potentials play a relatively important role in many channels, indicating that
further studies are needed once more experimental or lattice QCD data become
available.

The semiempirical approximation was constructed based on the results of the

the effective relaxation time $\tau\propto T_i^{-0.25}$. We have compared our
results with a number of other models. They are all reduced in the
low-temperature limit to the Drude model with different expressions for the
relaxation time $\tau$. Our results are not consistent with the models in which
$\tau\propto T_i^{-1}$ and support the models which use the expressions with
the slower decrease of the relaxation time.

atmospheres used in the abundance determinations may be responsible for this
disagreement. For this purpose, we used VLT CRIRES spectra of three EMP giants,
as well as 3D hydrodynamical CO$^5$BOLD and 1D hydrostatic LHD model
atmospheres, to investigate the role of convection in the formation of infrared
(IR) OH lines. Our results show that the presence of convection leads to
significantly stronger IR OH lines. As a result, the difference in the oxygen
abundance determined from IR OH lines with 3D hydrodynamical and classical 1D
hydrostatic model atmospheres may reach -0.2 ... -0.3 dex. In case of the three
EMP giants studied here, we obtain a good agrement between the 3D LTE oxygen
abundances determined by us using vibrational-rotational IR OH lines in the
spectral range of 1514-1626 nm, and oxygen abundances determined from forbidden
[O I] 630 nm line in previous studies.

Heijden, I described the static-dynamic analogy and its role in understanding
the localized post-buckling of shell-like structures, looking exclusively at
integrable systems. We showed the true significance of the Maxwell energy
criterion load in predicting the sudden onset of 'shock sensitivity' to lateral
disturbances. The present paper extends the survey to cover non-integrable
systems, such as thin compressed shells. These exhibit spatial chaos,
generating a multiplicity of localized paths (and escape routes) with complex
snaking and laddering phenomena. The final theoretical contribution shows how
these concepts relate to the response and energy barriers of an axially
compressed cylindrical shell.
  After surveying NASA's current shell-testing programme, a new non-destructive
technique is proposed to estimate the 'shock sensitivity' of a laboratory
specimen that is in a compressed meta-stable state before buckling. A probe is
used to measure the nonlinear load-deflection characteristic under a rigidly
applied lateral displacement. Sensing the passive resisting force, it can be
plotted in real time against the displacement, displaying an equilibrium path
along which the force rises to a maximum and then decreases to zero: having
reached the free state of the shell that forms a mountain-pass in the potential
energy. The area under this graph gives the energy barrier against lateral
shocks. The test is repeated at different levels of the overall compression. If
a symmetry-breaking bifurcation is encountered on the path, computer
simulations show how this can be supressed by a controlled secondary probe
tuned to deliver zero force on the shell.

the parallel heat transport equation using a Lagrangian-Green's function (LG)
method. The LG method provides an efficient and accurate technique that
circumvents limitations of finite elements and finite difference methods. The
main two problems addressed are: (i) The dependence of the radial transport on
the magnetic field stochasticity (controlled by the amplitude of the
perturbation, $\epsilon$); and (ii) The role of reversed shear configurations
on pulse propagation. In all the cases considered there are no magnetic flux
surfaces. However, radial transport is observed to depend strongly on
$\epsilon$ due to the presence of high-order magnetic islands and Cantori that
act as quasi-transport barriers that preclude the radial penetration of heat
pulses within physically relevant time scale. The dependence of the magnetic
field connection length, $\ell_B$, on $\epsilon$ is studied in detail. The
decay rate of the temperature maximum, $\langle T \rangle_{max}(t)$, the time
delay of the temperature response as function of the radius, $\tau$, and the
radial heat flux $\langle {{\bf q}\cdot {\hat e}_\psi} \rangle$, are also
studied as functions of the magnetic field stochasticity and $\ell_B$. In all
cases, the scaling of $\langle T \rangle_{max}$ with $t$ transitions from
sub-diffusive, $\langle T \rangle_{max} \sim t^{-1/4}$, at short times
($\chi_\parallel t< 10^5$) to a significantly slower scaling at longer times
($\chi_\parallel t > 10^5$). A strong dependence on $\epsilon$ is also observed
on $\tau$ and $\langle {{\bf q}\cdot {\hat e}_\psi} \rangle$. The radial
propagation of pulses in fully chaotic fields considerably slows down in the
shear reversal region and, as a result, $\tau$, in reversed shear
configurations is an order of magnitude longer than the one in monotonic
$q$-profiles.

good fit to the data and realistic predictions for the size of DM halos

larger galaxies correspond to the non-degenerate limit of the gas. We propose a

incorporates a hydrodynamically formed density spike, which nonlinearly
scatters the incident pump radiation, to produce a counter-propagating
electromagnetic wiggler. This self-generated wiggler field Compton scatters
from electrons accelerated in the laser wakefield of the pump radiation. The
nonlinear scattering mechanism in the density spike is examined theoretically
and numerically in order to optimize the Compton scattered radiation. It is
found that narrow-band x-rays are produced by moderate intensity pump radiation
incident on the quarter-critical surface of the density spike, while high
fluence, broadband x-rays are produced by high intensity pump radiation
reflected near the critical surface.

a decreasing behavior with an asymmetric mass gap with respect to the massless

values of the wave-function renormalisation. Nevertheless, there is an
alternative scenario that may provide Starobinsky-type inflation, occurring in
the broken-SUGRA phase around the non-trivial minima of the
gravitino-condensate effective potential. In this scenario higher curvature
corrections to the effective action, crucial for the onset of an inflationary
phase, arise as a result of integrating out massive quantum gravitino fields in
the path integral. The latter scenario is compatible with Planck satellite

approach to the limit is, however, very slow. We present a simple geometric
picture which explains these features in a natural way. A black disc of
logarithmically growing radius is supplemented by a soft `edge' whose
properties are invariant with energy. The constancy of the edge results in the
prediction that the quantity $(\sigma^{TOT}-2\sigma^{El})/\surd\sigma^{TOT}$

appears to be verified. The value of the limiting constant allows an estimate
of the thickness of the edge, which turns out to be on the order of $1\,{\rm

energies is dominated by what becomes the edge, while at higher energies it is
dominated by the disc. The crossover between the two regimes is only at $\surd

noninteracting-blip approximation (NIBA), applicable in the non-adiabatic
limit, and iterative, numerically-exact path integral tools. These
methodologies were originally developed for the description of the dissipative
dynamics of a quantum system, and here they are applied to explore the problem
of quantum energy transport in a non-equilibrium setting. Specifically, we
study the weak-to-intermediate system-bath coupling regime at high temperatures
$k_BT/\hbar>\epsilon$, with $\epsilon$ as the characteristic frequency of the
two-state system. The BR formalism and NIBA can lead to close results for the
dynamics of the reduced density matrix (RDM) in a certain range of parameters.
However, relatively small deviations in the RDM dynamics propagate into
significant qualitative discrepancies in the transport behavior. Similarly,
beyond the strict non-adiabatic limit NIBA's prediction for the heat current is
qualitatively incorrect: It fails to capture the turnover behavior of the
current with tunneling energy and temperature. Thus, techniques that proved
meaningful for describing the RDM dynamics, to some extent even beyond their
rigorous range of validity, should be used with great caution in heat transfer
calculations, since qualitative-serious failures develop once parameters are

the proliferation of applications that use phone sensors to monitor user

instance, the detection of valence in speech, or the identification of
speakers. Deploying multiple of these applications on a mobile device to
continuously monitor the audio environment allows for the acquisition of a
diverse range of sound-related contextual inferences. However, the cumulative
processing burden critically impacts the phone battery.
  To address this problem, we propose DSP.Ear - an integrated sensing system
that takes advantage of the latest low-power DSP co-processor technology in
commodity mobile devices to enable the continuous and simultaneous operation of
multiple established algorithms that perform complex audio inferences. The
system extracts emotions from voice, estimates the number of people in a room,
identifies the speakers, and detects commonly found ambient sounds, while
critically incurring little overhead to the device battery. This is achieved
through a series of pipeline optimizations that allow the computation to remain
largely on the DSP. Through detailed evaluation of our prototype implementation
we show that, by exploiting a smartphone's co-processor, DSP.Ear achieves a 3
to 7 times increase in the battery lifetime compared to a solution that uses
only the phone's main processor. In addition, DSP.Ear is 2 to 3 times more
power efficient than a naive DSP solution without optimizations. We further
analyze a large-scale dataset from 1320 Android users to show that in about
80-90% of the daily usage instances DSP.Ear is able to sustain a full day of
operation (even in the presence of other smartphone workloads) with a single

concentration inequalities, we show that when one performs community detection
via spectral clustering there exists an abrupt phase transition as a function
of the random external edge connection probability. Specifically, the community
detection performance transitions from almost perfect detectability to low
detectability near some critical value of the random external edge connection
probability. We derive upper and lower bounds on the critical value and show
that the bounds are equal to each other when two subnetwork sizes are
identical. Using simulated and experimental data we show how these bounds can
be empirically estimated to validate the detection reliability of any

Normalizer gates implement operations associated with the group $G$ and can be
of three types: quantum Fourier transforms, group automorphism gates and
quadratic phase gates. In this work, we extend the normalizer formalism [1,2]
to infinite dimensions, by allowing normalizer gates to act on systems of the
form $\mathcal{H}_\mathbb{Z}^{\otimes a}$: each factor $\mathcal{H}_\mathbb{Z}$
has a standard basis labeled by $\textit{integers}$ $\mathbb{Z}$, and a Fourier
basis labeled by $\textit{angles}$, elements of the circle group $\mathbb{T}$.
Normalizer circuits become hybrid quantum circuits acting both on continuous-
and discrete-variable systems. We show that infinite-dimensional normalizer
circuits can be efficiently simulated classically with a generalized
$\textit{stabilizer formalism}$ for Hilbert spaces associated with groups of
the form $\mathbb{Z}^a\times \mathbb{T}^b \times
\mathbb{Z}_{d_1}\times...\times \mathbb{Z}_{d_n}$. We develop new techniques to
track stabilizer-groups based on normal forms for group automorphisms and
quadratic functions. We use our normal forms to reduce the problem of
simulating normalizer circuits to that of finding general solutions of systems
of mixed real-integer linear equations [3] and exploit this fact to devise a
robust simulation algorithm: the latter remains efficient even in pathological
cases where stabilizer groups become infinite, uncountable and non-compact. The
techniques developed in this paper might find applications in the study of
fault-tolerant quantum computation with superconducting qubits [4,5].

uses a multilayered Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) to map the input sequence to
a vector of a fixed dimensionality, and then another deep LSTM to decode the
target sequence from the vector. Our main result is that on an English to
French translation task from the WMT'14 dataset, the translations produced by
the LSTM achieve a BLEU score of 34.8 on the entire test set, where the LSTM's
BLEU score was penalized on out-of-vocabulary words. Additionally, the LSTM did
not have difficulty on long sentences. For comparison, a phrase-based SMT
system achieves a BLEU score of 33.3 on the same dataset. When we used the LSTM
to rerank the 1000 hypotheses produced by the aforementioned SMT system, its
BLEU score increases to 36.5, which is close to the previous best result on

surface states (TSS), have emerged as a new class of electronic materials with
rich potentials for both novel physics and device applications. However, a
major challenge with realistic TI materials is to access, distinguish and
manipulate the electronic transport of TSS often obscured by other possible
parallel conduction channels that include the bulk as well as a two-dimensional
electron gas (2DEG) formed near the surface due to bending of the bulk bands.
Such a (Schrodinger-fermion) 2DEG represents topologically-trivial surface
states, whose coexistence with the TSS has been revealed by angle resolved
photoemission spectroscopy. Here we show that simple manipulations of surface
conditions can be used to access and control both types of surface states and
their coexistence in bulk-insulating Bi2Te2Se, whose surface conduction is
prominently manifested in temperature dependent resistance and nonlocal
transport. The trivial 2DEG and TSS can both exhibit clear Shubnikov-de Haas
oscillations in magnetoresistance, with different Berry phases ~0 and ~pi that
distinguish their different topological characters. We also report a deviation
from the typical weak antilocalization behavior, possibly due to high mobility
TSS. Our study enables distinguishing, controlling and harnessing electronic
transport of TI surface carriers with different topological natures.

perturbative slave boson method. Our starting point is the recently constructed
Anderson model that properly captures the band-structure topology of SmB$_6$.
Most self-consistent renormalization effects are captured by a few
phenomenological parameters whose values are fitted to match the calculated and
experimentally measured mode spectrum in the first Brillouin zone. A simple
band-structure of low-energy quasiparticles in SmB$_6$ is also modeled through
this fitting procedure, because the important renormalization effects due to
Coulomb interactions are hard to calculate by ab-initio methods. Despite
involving uncontrolled approximations, the slave boson calculation is capable
of producing a fairly good quantitative match of the energy spectrum, and a
qualitative match of the spectral weight throughout the first Brillouin zone.
We find that the ""fitted"" band-structure required for this match indeed puts
SmB$_6$ in the class of strong topological insulators. Our analysis thus
provides a detailed physical picture of how the SmB$_6$ band topology arises

Such models typically depend on various free parameters, which are not well

description of AGN feedback, where those parameters reflect the results of
recent observations. The model takes the dependency of these parameters on the
black hole properties into account and describes a continuous transition
between the feedback processes acting in the so-called radio-mode and
quasar-mode. In addition, we implement a more detailed description of the
accretion of gas onto black holes by distinguishing between hot and cold gas
accretion. Our new implementations prevent black holes from gaining too much
mass, particularly at low redshifts so that our simulations are now very
successful in reproducing the observed present-day black hole mass function.
Our new model also suppresses star formation in massive galaxies slightly more
efficiently than many state-of-the-art models. Therefore, the simulations that
include our new implementations produce a more realistic population of
quiescent and star-forming galaxies compared to recent observations, even if
some discrepancies remain. In addition, the baryon conversion efficiencies in
our simulation are - except for the high mass end - consistent with
observations presented in literature over the mass range resolved by our

Distances (W_VIc, [3.6]) for Cepheids in IC 1613 exhibit a galactocentric
dependence, whereby Cepheids near the core appear (spuriously) too bright (r_g
< 2'). That effect is attributed to photometric contamination from neighboring
(unresolved) stars, since the stellar density and surface brightness may
increase with decreasing galactocentric distance. The impact is relatively
indiscernible for a comparison sample of Cepheids occupying NGC 6822, a result
which is partly attributable to that sample being nearer than the metal-poor

acquire the universe by exchanging copies of segments among themselves, at low
cost, using inter-node links. While exchanges over inter-node links ensure
minimum or negligible cost, some nodes in the group try to exploit the system.
We term such nodes as `non-reciprocating nodes' and prohibit such behavior by
proposing the ""Give-and-Take"" criterion, where exchange is allowed iff each
participating node has segments unavailable with the other. Following this
criterion for inter-node links, each node wants to maximize its utility, which
depends on the node's segment set available with the node. Link activation
among nodes requires mutual consent of participating nodes. Each node tries to
find a pairing partner by preferentially exploring nodes for link formation and
unpaired nodes choose to download a segment using the expensive link with
segment aggressive probability. We present various linear complexity
decentralized algorithms based on \emph{Stable Roommates Problem} that can be
used by nodes (as per their behavioral nature) for choosing the best strategy
based on available information. Then, we present decentralized randomized
algorithm that performs close to optimal for large number of nodes. We define

(consisting of non-aggressive nodes only). We evaluate performances of various
algorithms and characterize the behavioral regime that will yield best results

kpc of the galaxy, in contrast to what was predicted from previous numerical
simulations. There is a trend of increasing star formation activity with
distance from the nucleus of the galaxy, and no evidence for a recent increase
in the current star formation rate (SFR) due to the interaction. The nucleus
itself shows no significant current star formation activity. The extent of the

of Red Giant Branch stars to determine the detailed star formation and chemical
evolution history. The star formation history confirms the episodic formation
history of Carina and quantifies the duration and strength of each episode in
great detail, as a function radius from the centre. Two main episodes of star
formation occurred at old (>8 Gyr) and intermediate (2-8 Gyr) ages, both
enriching stars starting from low metallicities ([Fe/H]<-2 dex). By dividing
the SFH into two components, we determine that 60pm9 percent of the total
number of stars formed within the intermediate age episode. Furthermore, within
the tidal radius (0.48 degrees or 888 pc) a total mass in stars of 1.07pm0.08
x10^6 M_sun was formed, giving Carina a stellar mass-to-light ratio of
1.8pm0.8. Combining the detailed star formation history with spectroscopic
observations of RGB stars, we are able to determine the detailed
age-metallicity relation of each episode and the timescale of alpha-element
evolution of Carina from individual stars. The oldest episode displays a tight
age-metallicity relation over 6 Gyr with steadily declining alpha-element
abundances and a possible alpha-element knee at [Fe/H]~ -2.5 dex. The
intermediate age sequence displays a more complex age-metallicity relation
starting from low metallicity and a sequence in alpha-element abundances with a
slope much steeper than observed in the old episode, starting from [Fe/H]=-1.8
dex and [Mg/Fe]~0.4 dex and declining to Mg-poor values ([Mg/Fe]<-0.5 dex).
This indicates clearly that both episodes of star formation formed from gas
with different abundance patterns, inconsistent with simple evolution in an
isolated system.

estimation. Assuming one-to-one ratio of proton and electron, we find that the
jet power for LSP blazars is systematically higher than that of FR II radio
galaxies at given 151 MHz radio luminosity, $L_{\rm 151MHz}$, even though FR
IIs are regarded as same as LSP blazars in unification scheme except the jet
viewing angle. The possible reason is that there are some $e^{\pm}$ pairs in
the jet of these blazars. If this is the case, we find the number density of
$e^{\pm}$ pairs should be several times higher than that of $e^{-}-p$ pairs by
assuming the jet power is the same for LSP blazars and FR IIs at given $L_{\rm

requires specialized analysis techniques. NuSTAR was primarily designed for
spectroscopic observations of sources with relatively low count-rates rather
than for timing analysis of bright objects. The instrumental dead time per
event is relatively long (~2.5 msec), and varies by a few percent
event-to-event. The most obvious effect is a distortion of the white noise
level in the power density spectrum (PDS) that cannot be modeled easily with
the standard techniques due to the variable nature of the dead time. In this
paper, we show that it is possible to exploit the presence of two completely
independent focal planes and use the cross power density spectrum to obtain a
good proxy of the white noise-subtracted PDS. Thereafter, one can use a Monte
Carlo approach to estimate the remaining effects of dead time, namely a
frequency-dependent modulation of the variance and a frequency-independent drop
of the sensitivity to variability. In this way, most of the standard timing
analysis can be performed, albeit with a sacrifice in signal to noise relative
to what would be achieved using more standard techniques. We apply this
technique to NuSTAR observations of the black hole binaries GX 339-4, Cyg X-1

feasibility of merging the NIS technique in a burst mode with high spectral

Nyquist pulse shaping with advanced modulation formats (e.g., QPSK, 16QAM, and

interaction among network components. The network components dynamics is
nonlinear and modeled in Lure form with linear stochastic interaction among
network components. To study this problem we first prove the stochastic version
of Positive Real Lemma (PRL). The stochastic PRL result is then used to provide
sufficient condition for synchronization of stochastic network system. The
sufficiency condition for synchronization, is a function of nominal (mean)
coupling Laplacian eigenvalues and the statistics of link uncertainty in the
form of coefficient of dispersion (CoD). Contrary to the existing literature on
network synchronization, our results indicate that both the largest and the
second smallest eigenvalue of the mean Laplacian play an important role in
synchronization of stochastic networks. Robust control-based small-gain
interpretation is provided for the derived sufficiency condition which allow us
to define the margin of synchronization. The margin of synchronization is used
to understand the important tradeoff between the component dynamics, network
topology, and uncertainty characteristics. For a special class of network
system connected over torus topology we provide an analytical expression for
the tradeoff between the number of neighbors and the dimension of the torus.
Similarly, by exploiting the identical nature of component dynamics
computationally efficient sufficient condition independent of network size is
provided for general class of network system. Simulation results for network of
coupled oscillators with stochastic link uncertainty are presented to verify
the developed theoretical framework.

with substantial uncertainty even over to what extent the recombination energy

We investigate the reaction of a red-giant envelope to heating which mimics
limiting cases of energy input provided by the orbital decay of a binary during
a CEE, specifically during the post-plunge-in phase during which the spiral-in
has been argued to occur on a time-scale longer than dynamical. We show that
the outcome of such a CEE depends less on the total amount of energy by which
the envelope is heated than on how rapidly the energy was transferred to the
envelope and on where the envelope was heated. The envelope always becomes
dynamically unstable before receiving net heat energy equal to the envelope's
initial binding energy. We find two types of outcome, both of which likely lead
to at least partial envelope ejection: ""runaway"" solutions in which the
expansion of the radius becomes undeniably dynamical, and superficially
""self-regulated"" solutions, in which the expansion of the stellar radius stops
but a significant fraction of the envelope becomes formally dynamically
unstable. Almost the entire reservoir of initial helium recombination energy is
used for envelope expansion. Hydrogen recombination is less energetically
useful, but is nonetheless important for the development of the dynamical
instabilities. However, this result requires the companion to have already
plunged deep into the envelope; therefore this release of recombination energy
does not help to explain wide post-common-envelope orbits.

rays with the Fermi Large Area Telescope and in thermal dust emission with
Planck and IRAS have been used with the HI and CO radio data to (i) map the gas
column densities in the different phases and at the dark neutral medium (DNM)
transition between the HI-bright and CO-bright media; (ii) constrain the
CO-to-$H_2$ conversion factor, $X_{CO}$; (iii) probe the dust properties per
gas nucleon in each gas phase and spatially across the clouds. We have
separated clouds in velocity in HI and CO emission and modelled the 0.4-100 GeV
intensity, the dust optical depth at 353 GHz, the thermal radiance of the large
grains, and an estimate of the dust extinction empirically corrected for the
starlight intensity, $A_{VQ}$. The gamma-ray emissivity spectra confirm that
the GeV-TeV cosmic rays uniformly permeate all gas phases up to the CO cores.
The dust and cosmic rays reveal large amounts of DNM gas, with comparable
spatial distributions and twice as much mass as in the CO-bright clouds. We
give constraints on the HI-DNM-CO transitions and CO-dark $H_2$ fractions for
separate clouds. The corrected extinction provides the best fit to the total
gas traced by the gamma rays, but we find evidence for a rise in $A_{VQ}/N_H$
and a steep rise in opacity, with increasing $N_H$ and $H_2$ fraction, and with
decreasing dust temperature. We observe less variations for the specific power
of the grains, except for a decline by half in the CO cores. This combined
information suggests grain evolution. The gamma rays and dust radiance yield
consistent $X_{CO}$ estimates near $0.7\times10^{20}$ cm$^{-2}$ (K
km/s)$^{-1}$. The other dust tracers yield biased values because of the grain
opacity rise in the CO clouds. These results also confirm a factor of 2
difference between $X_{CO}$ estimates at pc and kpc scales.

systems. Few studies, however, have investigated variance itself as a trait
under genetic control. By focusing primarily on trait means and ignoring the
effect of alternative alleles on trait variability, we may be missing an
important axis of genetic variation contributing to phenotypic differences
among individuals. To study genetic effects on individual-to-individual
phenotypic variability (or intragenotypic variability), we used a panel of
Drosophila inbred lines and focused on locomotor handedness, in an assay
optimized to measure variability. We discovered that some lines had
consistently high levels of intragenotypic variability among individuals while
others had low levels. We demonstrate that the degree of variability is itself
heritable. Using a genome-wide association study (GWAS) for the degree of
intragenotypic variability as the phenotype across lines, we identified several
genes expressed in the brain that affect variability in handedness without
affecting the mean. One of these genes, Ten-a, implicated a neuropil in the
central complex of the fly brain as influencing the magnitude of behavioral
variability, a brain region involved in sensory integration and locomotor
coordination. We have validated these results using genetic deficiencies, null
alleles, and inducible RNAi transgenes. This study reveals the constellation of
phenotypes that can arise from a single genotype and it shows that different
genetic backgrounds differ dramatically in their propensity for phenotypic
variability. Because traditional mean-focused GWASs ignore the contribution of
variability to overall phenotypic variation, current methods may miss important
links between genotype and phenotype.

standard statistical methods have provided an effective strategy for extracting

is subject to a common process. However, for other types of data (e.g.
morphological data), characters can be too ambiguous, homoplastic or saturated
to develop models that are effective at capturing the underlying process of

method for inferring splits in an underlying tree, namely, maximum
compatibility. By adopting a simple and extreme model in which each character
either fits perfectly on some tree, or is entirely random (but it is not known
which class any character belongs to) we are able to derive exact and explicit
formulae regarding the performance of maximum compatibility. We show that this
method is able to identify a set of non-trivial homoplasy-free characters, when
the number $n$ of taxa is large, even when the number of random characters is
large. By contrast, we show that a method that makes more uniform use of all
the data --- maximum parsimony --- can provably estimate trees in which {\em
none} of the original homoplasy-free characters support splits.

(MHD) turbulence by identifying dissipative structures and measuring their
characteristic scales. We find that the probability distribution of energy
dissipation rates exhibits a power law tail with index very close to the
critical value of -2.0, which indicates that structures of all intensities
contribute equally to energy dissipation. We find that energy dissipation is
uniformly spread among coherent structures with lengths and widths in the
inertial range. At the same time, these structures have thicknesses deep within
the dissipative regime. As the Reynolds number is increased, structures become
thinner and more numerous, while the energy dissipation continues to occur
mainly in large-scale coherent structures. This implies that in the limit of
high Reynolds number, energy dissipation occurs in thin, tightly packed current
sheets which nevertheless span a continuum of scales up to the system size,
exhibiting features of both coherent structures and nanoflares previously
conjectured as a coronal heating mechanism.

generalized the concept of cirquents to the version with what are termed

to estimating a large precision matrix $\Omega$. To estimate the $i$-th row of
$\Omega$, $1 \leq i \leq p$, PCS uses a Screen step and a Clean step. In the
Screen step, PCS recruits a (small) subset of indices using a stage-wise
algorithm, where in each stage, the algorithm updates the set of recruited
indices by adding the index $j$ that has the largest (in magnitude) empirical
partial correlation with $i$. In the Clean step, PCS re-investigates all
recruited indices and use them to reconstruct the $i$-th row of $\Omega$.
  PCS is computationally efficient and modest in memory use: to estimate a row
of $\Omega$, it only needs a few rows (determined sequentially) of the
empirical covariance matrix. This enables PCS to execute the estimation of a
large precision matrix (e.g., $p=10K$) in a few minutes, and open doors to
estimating much larger precision matrices.
  We use PCS for classification. Higher Criticism Thresholding (HCT) is a
recent classifier that enjoys optimality, but to exploit its full potential in
practice, one needs a good estimate of the precision matrix $\Omega$. Combining
HCT with any approach to estimating $\Omega$ gives a new classifier: examples
include HCT-PCS and HCT-glasso. We have applied HCT-PCS to two large microarray
data sets ($p = 8K$ and $10K$) for classification, where it not only
significantly outperforms HCT-glasso, but also is competitive to the Support
Vector Machine (SVM) and Random Forest (RF). The results suggest that PCS gives
more useful estimates of $\Omega$ than the glasso.
  We set up a general theoretical framework and show that in a broad context,
PCS fully recovers the support of $\Omega$ and HCT-PCS yields optimal
classification behavior. Our proofs shed interesting light on the behavior of
stage-wise procedures.

However, imperfect-recall abstractions are poorly understood, and only weak

show the first general, algorithm-agnostic, solution quality guarantees for
Nash equilibria and approximate self-trembling equilibria computed in
imperfect-recall abstractions, when implemented in the original
(perfect-recall) game. Our results are for a class of games that generalizes
the only previously known class of imperfect-recall abstractions where any
results had been obtained. Further, our analysis is tighter in two ways, each
of which can lead to an exponential reduction in the solution quality error
bound.
  We then show that for extensive-form games that satisfy certain properties,
the problem of computing a bound-minimizing abstraction for a single level of
the game reduces to a clustering problem, where the increase in our bound is
the distance function. This reduction leads to the first imperfect-recall
abstraction algorithm with solution quality bounds. We proceed to show a divide
in the class of abstraction problems. If payoffs are at the same scale at all
information sets considered for abstraction, the input forms a metric space.
Conversely, if this condition is not satisfied, we show that the input does not
form a metric space. Finally, we use these results to experimentally
investigate the quality of our bound for single-level abstraction.

(acquired immunodeficiency syndrome) in Central and South Americas, and it was
also the first developing country to implement a large-scale control and
intervention program against AIDS epidemic. In this scenario, we investigate
the temporal evolution and current status of the AIDS epidemic in Brazil.
Specifically, we analyze records of annual absolute frequency of cases for more
than 5000 cities for the first 33 years of the infection in Brazil. We found
that (i) the annual absolute frequencies exhibit a logistic-type growth with an
exponential regime in the first few years of the AIDS spreading; (ii) the
actual reproduction number decaying as a power law; (iii) the distribution of
the annual absolute frequencies among cities decays with a power law behavior;
(iv) the annual absolute frequencies and the number of inhabitants have an
allometric relationship; (v) the temporal evolution of the annual absolute
frequencies have different profile depending on the average annual absolute
frequencies in the cities. These findings yield a general quantitative
description of the AIDS infection dynamics in Brazil since the beginning. They
also provide clues about the effectiveness of treatment and control programs
against the infection, that has had a different impact depending on the number
of inhabitants of cities. In this framework, our results give insights into the
overall dynamics of AIDS epidemic, which may contribute to select empirically
accurate models.

  Optimization","submitted to IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing",,"10.1109/TSP.2016.2544743",,"cs.SY math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper studies efficient distributed optimization methods for multi-agent
networks. Specifically, we consider a convex optimization problem with a
globally coupled linear equality constraint and local polyhedra constraints,
and develop distributed optimization methods based on the alternating direction
method of multipliers (ADMM). The considered problem has many applications in
machine learning and smart grid control problems. Due to the presence of the
polyhedra constraints, agents in the existing methods have to deal with
polyhedra constrained subproblems at each iteration. One of the key issues is
that projection onto a polyhedra constraint is not trivial, which prohibits
from closed-form solutions or the use of simple algorithms for solving these
subproblems. In this paper, by judiciously integrating the proximal
minimization method with ADMM, we propose a new distributed optimization method
where the polyhedra constraints are handled softly as penalty terms in the
subproblems. This makes the subproblems efficiently solvable and consequently
reduces the overall computation time. Furthermore, we propose a randomized
counterpart that is robust against randomly ON/OFF agents and imperfect
communication links. We analytically show that both the proposed methods have a
worst-case $\mathcal{O}(1/k)$ convergence rate, where $k$ is the iteration
number. Numerical results show that the proposed methods offer considerably
lower computation time than the existing distributed ADMM method.

inviscid potential flow. The model arises in aeroelasticity and models the
interaction between a thin, nonlinear panel and a flow of gas in which it is
immersed [6, 21, 23]. Recent results in [16, 18] show that the plate component
of the dynamics (in the presence of a physical plate nonlinearity) converge to
a global compact attracting set of finite dimension; these results were
obtained in the absence of mechanical damping of any type. Here we show that,
by incorporating mechanical damping the full flow-plate system, full
trajectories---both plate and flow---converge strongly to (the set of)
stationary states. Weak convergence results require ""minimal"" interior damping,
and strong convergence of the dynamics are shown with sufficiently large
damping. We require the existence of a ""good"" energy balance equation, which is
only available when the flows are subsonic. Our proof is based on first showing
the convergence properties for regular solutions, which in turn requires
propagation of initial regularity on the infinite horizon. Then, we utilize the
exponential decay of the difference of two plate trajectories to show that full
flow-plate trajectories are uniform-in-time Hadamard continuous. This allows us
to pass convergence properties of smooth initial data to finite energy type
initial data. Physically, our results imply that flutter (a non-static end
behavior) does not occur in subsonic dynamics. While such results were known
for rotational (compact/regular) plate dynamics [14] (and references therein),
the result presented herein is the first such result obtained for
non-regularized---the most physically relevant---models.

gate-tuning of the Fermi level in the bulk band gap under magnetic fields, the
quantum Hall states with filling factor \nu = \pm 1 are resolved with quantized
Hall resistance of Ryx = h/e2 and zero longitudinal resistance, owing to chiral
edge modes at top/bottom surface Dirac states. Furthermore, the appearance of a
\nu = 0 state (\sigma xy = 0) reflects a pseudo-spin Hall insulator state when
the Fermi level is tuned in between the energy levels of the non-degenerate top

pave a way toward TI-based electronics.

quadrature, the obligatory, simultaneous vanishing of the imaginary part
alluded to still another pair of real integrals forming the first two entries

identical reasoning, utilizing the same contour but a slightly different
analytic function thereon, sufficed not only to evaluate that sequence anew, on

imaginary part, to recover the fundamental Bernoulli number recurrence. The
even order Bernoulli numbers $B_{2k}$ entering therein were revealed on the
basis of their celebrated connection to Riemann's zeta function $\zeta(2k).$
Conversely, by permitting the related Bernoulli polynomials to participate as
integrand factors, Euler's connection itself received an independent
demonstration, accompanied once more by an elegant log-sine evaluation,
alternative to that already given. And, while the Bernoulli recurrence is
intended to enjoy here the pride of place, this note ends on a gloss wherein
all the motivating real integrals are recovered yet again, and in quite

attractive interactions in a dense hadronic medium, hence reducing the masses
of the $D_S^+$ and $D_S^-$ mesons from the vacuum values. While this conclusion
holds in both nuclear and hyperonic media, the magnitude of the mass drop is
observed to intensify with the inclusion of strangeness in the medium.
Additionally, in hyperonic medium, the mass degeneracy of the $D_S$ mesons is

of a connection choice on the tangent bundle. It is well known that at
$\mathcal{O}(\alpha')$ the Hull connection gives a consistent supergravity
theory with supersymmetry transformations given in the usual way. We consider
deformations of this connection corresponding to field redefinitions, and the
necessary corrections to the supersymmetry transformations. We are interested
in the moduli space of such field redefinitions which allow for supersymmetric
solutions to the equations of motion. We show that for solutions on $M_4\times
X$, where $M_4$ is Minkowski and $X$ is compact, the moduli space of
infinitesimal field redefinitions is given by $H^{(0,1)}(X,\textrm{End}(TX))$.
This space corresponds to infinitesimally close connections for which the
equations of motion are satisfied. The setup suggests a symmetry between the
gauge connection and the tangent bundle connection, as also employed by
Bergshoeff and de Roo. We argue that this symmetry should be kept to higher
orders in $\alpha'$, and propose a natural choice for the corresponding tangent
bundle connection used in curvature computations. In particular, the Hull
connection should be corrected at second and higher orders in $\alpha'$ from
this point of view.

cosmological parameters through the gravitational lensing effect of the cosmic
microwave background (CMB) and make predictions for the next generation
surveys. By assuming the detection of a series of $\approx 5 - 10$ voids along
a line of sight within a square-degree patch of the sky, we found that they can
be used to break the degeneracy direction of some of the cosmological parameter
constraints (for example $\omega_b$ and $\Omega_\Lambda$) in comparison with
the constraints from random CMB skies with the same size area for a survey with
extensive integration time. This analysis is based on our current knowledge of
the average void profile and analytical estimates of the void number function.
We also provide combined cosmological parameter constraints between a sky patch
where series of voids are detected and a patch without voids (a randomly
selected patch). The full potential of this technique relies on an accurate
determination of the void profile to $\approx 10$% level. For a small-area CMB
observation with extensive integration time and a high signal-to-noise ratio,
CMB lensing with such series of voids will provide a complementary route to
cosmological parameter constraints to the CMB observations. Example of
parameter constraints with a series of five voids on a $1.0^{\circ} \times

The behaviors of these quantities typically depend on the spectral dimension

d_s $ and the so-called hub spectral dimension $d_s^{\textrm{(hub)}}$ due to
the heterogeneity of connectivities of each node. To understand the origin of

problem on hierarchical scale-free networks by using the renormalization group
(RG) approach. Under the RG transformation, not only the system size but also
the degree of each node changes due to the scale-free nature of the degree
distribution. We show that the anomalous behavior of random walks involving the

the power-law degree distribution under the RG transformation.

composite operators properly extended to non-zero temperature and density. This
makes it possible to introduce into this general formalism the mass gap, which
is responsible for the large-scale dynamical structure of the QCD ground state.
The mass gap dependent gluon plasma pressure adjusted by this approach to the
corresponding lattice data is shown to be a continuously growing function of
temperature being thus differentiable in every point of its domain. At the same
time, the entropy and energy densities have finite jump discontinuities at some
characteristic temperature $T_c = 266.5 \ \MeV$ with latent heat
$\epsilon_{LH}= 1.41$. This is a firm evidence of the first-order phase
transition in $SU(3)$ pure gluon plasma. The heat capacity has a $\delta$-type
singularity (an essential discontinuity) at $T_c$, so that the velocity of
sound squared becomes zero at this point. All the independent thermodynamic
quantities are exponentially suppressed below $T_c$ and rather slowly approach
their respective Stefan-Boltzmann limits at high temperatures. Those
thermodynamic quantities which are the ratios of their independent counterparts
such as conformity, conformality and the velocity of sound squared approach
their Stefan-Boltzmann limits rather rapidly and demonstrate a non-trivial
dependence on the temperature below $T_c$. We also calculate the trace anomaly
relation (the interaction measure) and closely related to it the gluon
condensate, which are especially sensitive to the non-perturbative effects. An
analytical description of the dynamical structure of $SU(3)$ gluon plasma is
given.

Unfortunately, a comprehensive comparison between the different M-E codes
available to the solar physics community is still missing, and so is a physical
interpretation of their inferences. In this contribution we offer a comparison
between three of those codes (VFISV, ASP/HAO, and HeLIx$^+$). These codes are
used to invert synthetic Stokes profiles that were previously obtained from
realistic non-grey three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamical (3D MHD)
simulations. The results of the inversion are compared with each other and with
those from the MHD simulations. In the first case, the M-E codes retrieve
values for the magnetic field strength, inclination and line-of-sight velocity
that agree with each other within $\sigma_B \leq 35$ (Gauss), $\sigma_\gamma
\leq 1.2\deg$, and $\sigma_{\rm v} \leq 10$ ms$^{-1}$, respectively.
Additionally, M-E inversion codes agree with the numerical simulations, when
compared at a fixed optical depth, within $\sigma_B \leq 130$ (Gauss),
$\sigma_\gamma \leq 5\deg$, and $\sigma_{\rm v} \leq 320$ ms$^{-1}$. Finally,
we show that employing generalized response functions to determine the height
at which M-E codes measure physical parameters is more meaningful than
comparing at a fixed geometrical height or optical depth. In this case the
differences between M-E inferences and the 3D MHD simulations decrease to
$\sigma_B \leq 90$ (Gauss), $\sigma_\gamma \leq 3\deg$, and $\sigma_{\rm v}
\leq 90$ ms$^{-1}$.

Rayleigh-Benard convection. These scales are directly connected to the highly
intermittent fluctuations of the fluxes of momentum and heat at the isothermal
top and bottom walls and are statistically distributed around the corresponding
mean thickness scales. The local boundary layer scales also reflect the strong
spatial inhomogeneities of both boundary layers due to the large-scale, but
complex and intermittent, circulation that builds up in closed convection
cells. Similar to turbulent boundary layers, we define inner scales based on
local shear stress which can be consistently extended to the classical viscous
scales in bulk turbulence, e.g. the Kolmogorov scale, and outer scales based on
slopes at the wall. We discuss the consequences of our generalization, in
particular the scaling of our inner and outer boundary layer thicknesses and
the resulting shear Reynolds number with respect to Rayleigh number. The mean
outer thickness scale for the temperature field is close to the standard
definition of a thermal boundary layer thickness. In the case of the velocity
field, under certain conditions the outer scale follows a similar scaling as
the Prandtl-Blasius type definition with respect to Rayleigh number, but
differs quantitatively. The friction coefficient c_epsilon scaling is found to
fall right between the laminar and turbulent limits which indicates that the
boundary layer exhibits transitional behavior. Additionally, we conduct an
analysis of the recently suggested dissipation layer thickness scales versus
Rayleigh number and find a transition in the scaling. We also performed one

into injectively immersed submanifolds, called leaves. In this thesis we study
foliations whose leaves carry some specific geometric structures. The thesis
consists of two parts. In the first part we classify foliations on open
manifolds whose leaves are either locally conformal symplectic or contact
manifolds. These foliations can be described by some higher geometric
structures - namely the Poisson and the Jacobi structures. In the second part
of the thesis, we consider foliations on open contact manifolds whose leaves
are contact submanifolds of the ambient space. Theory of h-principle plays the
central role in deriving the main results of the thesis. It is a theory rich in
topological techniques to solve partial differential relations which arise in
connection with topology and geometry. All the geometric structures mentioned
above satisfy some differential conditions and that brings us into the realm of
the h-principle theory.

has been associated with the unknown-redshift blazar MG4 J200112+4352. Based on
its gamma-ray spectral properties, it was identified as a potential very high
energy (VHE; E > 100 GeV) gamma-ray emitter. The source was observed with MAGIC
first in 2009 and later in 2010 within a multi-instrument observation campaign.
The MAGIC observations yielded 14.8 hours of good quality stereoscopic data.
The object was monitored at radio, optical and gamma-ray energies during the
years 2010 and 2011. The source, named MAGIC J2001+439, is detected for the
first time at VHE with MAGIC at a statistical significance of 6.3 {\sigma} (E >
70 GeV) during a 1.3-hour long observation on 2010 July 16. The
multi-instrument observations show variability in all energy bands with the
highest amplitude of variability in the X-ray and VHE bands. We also organized
deep imaging optical observations with the Nordic Optical Telescope in 2013 to
determine the source redshift. We determine for the first time the redshift of
this BL Lac object through the measurement of its host galaxy during low blazar
activity. Using the observational evidence that the luminosities of BL Lac host
galaxies are confined to a relatively narrow range, we obtain z = 0.18 +/-
0.04. Additionally, we use the Fermi-LAT and MAGIC gamma-ray spectra to provide
an independent redshift estimation, z = 0.17 +/- 0.10. Using the former (more
accurate) redshift value, we adequately describe the broadband emission with a
one-zone SSC model for different activity states and interpret the few-day
timescale variability as produced by changes in the high-energy component of
the electron energy distribution.

this observation the low energy photoelectric cut-off is at about $\sim 1$ keV

$N_{\mathrm{H}}$, which decreased from $N_{\mathrm{H}} \sim10^{23}$ cm $^{-2}$
to $10^{22}$ cm $^{-2}$ in a 100 ks time-scale. The spectral analysis of the
last segment of the observation revealed the presence of several absorption
features that can be associated with an ionized (log $\xi \sim 2$ erg cm
s$^{-1}$) outflowing wind ($v_{\mathrm{out}} \sim 2000$ km s$^{-1}$). We
detected for the first time a possible P-Cygni profile of the Mg\,\textsc{xii}
Ly$\alpha$ line associated with this mildly ionized absorber indicative of a
wide angle outflowing wind. We suggest that this wind is a low ionization zone
of the highly ionized wind present in NGC 1365, which is responsible for the
iron K absorption lines and is located within the variable X-ray absorber. At
the end of the observation, we detected a strong absorption line at $E\sim
0.76$ keV most likely associated with a lower ionization zone of the absorber
(log $\xi \sim 0.2$ erg cm s$^{-1}$, $N_{\mathrm{H}} \sim 10^{22}$ cm $^{-2}$),

azimuth. The data, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of approximately
35 inverse nanobarns, were collected at a nucleon-nucleon center-of-mass energy
(sqrt(s[NN])) of 5.02 TeV with the CMS detector at the LHC. The results are
compared to semi-peripheral PbPb collision data at sqrt(s[NN]) = 2.76 TeV,
covering similar charged-particle multiplicities in the events. The observed
azimuthal correlations at large relative pseudorapidity are used to extract the
second-order (v[2]) and third-order (v[3]) anisotropy harmonics of K0S and
Lambda/anti-Lambda particles. These quantities are studied as a function of the
charged-particle multiplicity in the event and the transverse momentum of the
particles. For high-multiplicity pPb events, a clear particle species
dependence of v[2] and v[3] is observed. For pt < 2 GeV, the v[2] and v[3]
values of K0S particles are larger than those of Lambda/anti-Lambda particles
at the same pt. This splitting effect between two particle species is found to
be stronger in pPb than in PbPb collisions in the same multiplicity range. When
divided by the number of constituent quarks and compared at the same transverse
kinetic energy per quark, both v[2] and v[3] for K0S particles are observed to
be consistent with those for Lambda/anti-Lambda particles at the 10% level in
pPb collisions. This consistency extends over a wide range of particle
transverse kinetic energy and event multiplicities.

Within an asymptotic framework, in which a scale parameter $n$ is taken large,
a uniform (in the scale parameter) Lyapunov condition imposed on the sequence
of diffusion models guarantees that the gap between the steady-state moments of
the diffusion and those of the properly centered and scaled CTMCs shrinks at a
rate of $\sqrt{n}$. Our proofs build on gradient estimates for solutions of the
Poisson equations associated with the (sequence of) diffusion models and on
elementary martingale arguments. As a by-product of our analysis, we explore
connections between Lyapunov functions for the fluid model, the diffusion model

  In this special setting new solution techniques are available, and we can
make considerable progress towards an analytical solution. This means we are

states and has been considered to boost the sensitivity of GW detectors, e.g.
via the optical spring effect. Here, we present the experimental
characterization of generalized, that is, dispersive and dissipative
optomechanical coupling, with a macroscopic (1.5mm)^2-sized silicon nitride
(SiN) membrane in a cavity-enhanced Michelson-type interferometer. We report
for the first time strong optomechanical cooling based on dissipative coupling,
even on cavity resonance, in excellent agreement with theory. Our result will
allow for new experimental regimes in macroscopic quantum physics and GW

(SN IIP) 2013am in the nearby spiral galaxy M65 are presented in this paper.
The early spectra are characterized by relatively narrow P-Cygni features, with
ejecta velocities much lower than observed in normal SNe IIP (i.e., $\sim$2000
km s$^{-1}$ vs. $\sim$5000 km $^{-1}$ in the middle of the plateau phase).
Moreover, prominent Ca II absorptions are also detected in SN 2013am at
relatively early phases. These spectral features are reminiscent of those seen
in the low-velocity and low-luminosity SN IIP 2005cs. However, SN 2013am
exhibits different photometric properties, having shorter plateau phases and
brighter light-curve tails if compared to SN 2005cs. Adopting $R_{V}$=3.1 and a
mean value of total reddening derived from the photometric and spectroscopic
methods(i.e., $E(B-V)=0.55\pm$0.19 mag), we find that SN 2013am may have
reached an absolute $V$-band peak magnitude of $-15.83\pm0.71$ mag, and
produced a $^{56}$Ni mass of $0.016^{+0.010}_{-0.006} solar masses in the
explosion. These parameters are close to those derived for SN 2008in and SN
2009N which have been regarded as ""gap-filler"" objects linking the faint SNe
IIP to the normal ones. This indicates that some low-velocity SNe IIP may not
necessarily result from the low-energetic explosions, and the low expansion
velocities could be due to a lower metallicity of the progenitor stars, a
larger envelope mass ejected in the explosion, or that is was observed at an
angle that is away from the polar direction.

mechanical buckling. Mechanical pressure control always leads to fully
collapsed states with opposite sides in contact, whereas uncollapsed states
with a single finite dimple are generic for osmotic pressure control. For
sufficiently large interior osmolyte concentrations, osmotic pressure control
is qualititatively similar to buckling under volume control with the volume
prescribed by the osmolyte concentrations inside and outside the shell. We
present a quantitative theory which also captures the influence of shell
elasticity on the relation between osmotic pressure and volume. These findings
are relevant for the control of buckled shapes in applications. We show how the
osmolyte concentration can be used to control the volume of buckled shells. An
accurate analytic formula is derived for the relation between the osmotic
pressure, the elastic moduli and the volume of buckled capsules. This also
allows to use elastic capsules as osmotic pressure sensors or to deduce elastic

1630-47 during its 2012-2013 outburst. The first five observations monitor the
source as its luminosity increases across the high-soft state of accretion. In
the sixth observation the source has made a transition to an ""anomalous"" state,
characterised by a significant contribution of electron scattering. A
thermally/radiatively driven disc wind is present in the first four
observations, which becomes more photoionised as the luminosity increases with
time. In the fifth observation, the wind is not observed any more as a
consequence of strong photoionisation and the low sensitivity of this
observation. This overall trend is then consistent with a fully ionised wind
causing the electron scattering characteristic of the anomalous state in the
sixth observation. A broad iron emission line co-exists with the absorption
features from the wind in the first four observations but is not visible in the
last two observations. We find that the changes in the state of the wind as
measured from modelling the absorption features with a self-consistent warm
absorber model are correlated to the changes in the broad iron line. When the
latter is modeled with a reflection component we find that the reflection
fraction decreases as the illumination increases. We propose that the changes
in both the absorption and broad emission lines are caused by the increasing
luminosity and temperature of the accretion disc along the soft state. Such
changes ultimately enable the transition to a state where the wind is fully
ionised and consequently Comptonisation plays a significant role.

temperature anisotropy (depending on the orientation of the ambient magnetic
field). For the chosen parameters the Coulomb collisions are important with
respect to the driver but are not strong enough to keep the system stable with
respect to instabilities driven by the proton temperature anisotropy. In the

transport coefficients dominate over the collisional ones and their properties
are similar to those in collisionless plasmas.

conductance features: the 0.7-anomaly in the former case, the Kondo effect in
the latter. For both the 0.7-anomaly and the Kondo effect, the conductance
shows a remarkably similar low-energy dependence on temperature $T$,
source-drain voltage $V_{\rm sd}$ and magnetic field $B$. In a recent
publication [F. Bauer et al., Nature, 501, 73 (2013)], we argued that the
reason for these similarities is that both a QPC and a KQD feature spin
fluctuations that are induced by the sample geometry, confined in a small
spatial regime, and enhanced by interactions. Here we further explore this
notion experimentally and theoretically by studying the geometric crossover
between a QD and a QPC, focussing on the $B$-field dependence of the
conductance. We introduce a one-dimensional model that reproduces the essential
features of the experiments, including a smooth transition between a Kondo QD
and a QPC with 0.7-anomaly. We find that in both cases the anomalously strong
negative magnetoconductance goes hand in hand with strongly enhanced local spin
fluctuations. Our experimental observations include, in addition to the Kondo
effect in a QD and the 0.7-anomaly in a QPC, Fano interference effects in a
regime of coexistence between QD and QPC physics, and Fabry-Perot-type
resonances on the conductance plateaus of a clean QPC. We argue that
Fabry-Perot-type resonances occur generically if the electrostatic potential of
the QPC generates a flatter-than-parabolic barrier top.

within a $2+1+1$-flavored effective Lagrangian incorporating heavy quark
symmetry. The charmed-meson mean fields act as an extra source which breaks the
chiral symmetry explicitly. This leads to effective interactions between the
light and heavy-light mesons, which intrinsically depend on temperature.
Effective masses of the scalar and pseudoscalar charmed-mesons tend to approach
each other as increasing temperature, so that the splitting between the chiral
partners is reduced. These chiral splittings are shown to be less sensitive to
the light-quark flavors, attributed to the underlying heavy quark symmetry.
Consequently, chiral symmetry restoration is more manifest for the strange
charmed-mesons than for the strange light mesons. The effective masses are also
compared with the results in the one-loop chiral perturbation theory. A
substantial difference is found at a relatively low temperature, $T \sim

polarization from thick hazy atmospheres. We present the first limb
polarization measurements of Titan, which are compared as a test to our limb
polarization models. Previously unpublished imaging polarimetry from the HST
archive is presented which resolves the disk of Titan. We determine
flux-weighted averages of the limb polarization and radial limb polarization
profiles, and investigate the degradation and cancelation effects in the
polarization signal due to the limited spatial resolution of our observations.
Taking this into account we derive corrected values for the limb polarization
in Titan. The results are compared with limb polarization models, using
atmosphere and haze scattering parameters from the literature.
  In the wavelength bands between 250 nm and 2000 nm a strong limb polarization
of about 2-7 % is detected with a position angle perpendicular to the limb. The
fractional polarization is highest around 1 micron. As a first approximation,
the polarization seems to be equally strong along the entire limb. The detected
polarization is compatible with expectations from previous polarimetric
observations taken with Voyager 2, Pioneer 11, and the Huygens probe.
  Our results indicate that ground-based monitoring measurements of the
limb-polarization of Titan could be useful for investigating local haze
properties and the impact of short-term and seasonal variations of the hazy
atmosphere of Titan. Planets with hazy atmospheres similar to Titan are
particularly good candidates for detection with the polarimetric mode of the
upcoming planet finder instrument at the VLT. Therefore, a good knowledge of
the polarization properties of Titan is also important for the search and
investigation of extra-solar planets.

that the asymptotic capacity is given by a much simpler SDP, which coincides
with a semidefinite generalization of the fractional packing number suggested

optimized so that, in the quasi-static regime, the combined system exhibits
prescribed effective acoustic properties. The mechanism consists of a central
mass supported by an axisymmetric distribution of elastic stiffeners. By
appropriate selection of the mass and stiffness of the internal mechanism, the
shell's effective acoustic properties (bulk modulus and density) can be tuned
as desired. Subsonic flexural waves excited in the shell by the attachment of
stiffeners are suppressed by including a sufficiently large number of such
stiffeners. Effectiveness of the proposed metamaterial is demonstrated by
matching the properties of a thin aluminum shell with a polymer insert to those
of water. The scattering cross section in water is nearly zero over a broad
range of frequencies at the lower end of the spectrum. By arranging the tuned
shells in an array the resulting acoustic metamaterial is capable of steering
waves. As an example, a cylindrical-to-plane wave lens is designed by varying
the bulk modulus in the array according to the conformal mapping of a unit
circle to a square.

Bogomol'nyi-Prasad-Sommerfield (BPS) fractional instantons with topological
charge greater than unity (of order $N_{\rm C}$) that cannot be reduced to a
composite of an instanton and fractional instantons. As a consequence, we find
that the Grassmann sigma model admits neutral bions made of BPS and anti-BPS
fractional instantons each of which has topological charge greater (less) than
one (minus one), that are not decomposable into instanton anti-instanton and

tool for discovering useful relational features for subsequent use in a
predictive model. Conceptually, the case for using ILP to construct relational
features rests on treating these features as functions, the automated discovery
of which necessarily requires some form of first-order learning. Practically,
there are now several reports in the literature that suggest that augmenting
any existing features with ILP-discovered relational features can substantially
improve the predictive power of a model. While the approach is straightforward
enough, much still needs to be done to scale it up to explore more fully the
space of possible features that can be constructed by an ILP system. This is in
principle, infinite and in practice, extremely large. Applications have been
confined to heuristic or random selections from this space. In this paper, we
address this computational difficulty by allowing features to be constructed in
a distributed manner. That is, there is a network of computational units, each
of which employs an ILP engine to construct some small number of features and
then builds a (local) model. We then employ a consensus-based algorithm, in
which neighboring nodes share information to update local models. For a
category of models (those with convex loss functions), it can be shown that the
algorithm will result in all nodes converging to a consensus model. In
practice, it may be slow to achieve this convergence. Nevertheless, our results
on synthetic and real datasets that suggests that in relatively short time the
""best"" node in the network reaches a model whose predictive accuracy is
comparable to that obtained using more computational effort in a
non-distributed setting (the best node is identified as the one whose weights
converge first).

Nozi\`eres that enter to first order in the excitation energy, and two
additional ones that enter to second order and are needed away from
particle-hole symmetry. We express all four parameters in terms of
zero-temperature physical observables, namely the local charge and spin
susceptibilities and their derivatives with respect to the local level
position. We determine these in terms of the bare parameters of the Anderson
model using Bethe Ansatz and Numerical Renormalization Group (NRG)
calculations. Our low-energy Fermi-liquid theory applies throughout the
crossover from the strong-coupling Kondo regime via the mixed-valence regime to
the empty-orbital regime. From the Fermi-liquid theory, we determine the
conductance through a quantum dot symmetrically coupled to two leads in the
regime of small magnetic field, low temperature and small bias voltage, and

crowding due to inert polymers caused enhanced run lengths of motors, but
displayed an increased tendency for non-specific motor association and

bound associated proteins slowed forward motion, but did not drastically affect
the association times, in opposition to previously reported obstacle properties

J1740+1000, with dispersion measure of 24 pc cm$^{-3}$, is the first GPS pulsar
with such a low DM value.We also selected several strong candidates for objects
with high frequency turnover in their spectra which require further
investigation.We also revisit our source selection criteria for future searches

collapses. This is commonly taken to be a black hole with a singularity
surrounded by a horizon and which evolves by emitting Hawking radiation. In a
quantum theory of gravity, singularities are expected to be resolved and the
evolutions are expected to be unitary. Assuming that such a theory with these
properties exists, and with a few more physically motivated assumptions, we
argue that a massive compact object has no singularity (by assumption) and must
also have no horizon; otherwise, there may be a loss of predictability in the
case of a black hole candidate observed today. With no singularity and also
with no horizon, the massive compact object will then evolve as a standard
quantum system with large number of interacting degrees of freedom.

case of different number of coupled chains and doping by different
transition-metal (TM) atoms within the time-dependent density-functional theory
(TDDFT) approach. We find that as the number of chains in the array increases
the plasmon peak shifts from the sub-eV towards the visible range. As doping
with TM atoms increases, the visible absorption band broadens, owing to
formation of additional plasmon peaks. The optical response is very sensitive
to the type of doped atoms, their number and position; in particular, the
additional peaks are most pronounced in the case of weak doping when they
correspond to local plasmon oscillations around the impurity atom. These
effects have a potential to be used in various modern technologies, from
sensors to solar cells. Most of the studies of nano-plasmon effects have been
focused on alkali- and noble-metal systems with extended s-electron states,
while it was believed that doping with TM atoms with their more localized
charge as a rule leads to an attenuation of the plasmon modes. We demonstrate
that TM atoms can play a constructive role in plasmon generation in small chain
systems, and that plasmonic modes can emerge even in some pure TM nanochains.

impacting the dynamics of the flow. In particular, using the Q-R diagram, we
focus on the interaction between the strain-rate and rotation tensors, the
symmetric and skew-symmetric parts of the velocity gradient tensor

  Two consistent monads have a coproduct iff either they have arbitrarily large

the empty set. Hence a consistent monad has a coproduct with every monad iff it

time, which states that the momentum of light in a medium is parallel to the
wave vector in all inertial frames of reference. By rigorous analysis, novel
basic properties of the plane wave are exposed: (a) Poynting vector does not
necessarily represent the electromagnetic (EM) power flow when a medium moves;
(b) Minkowski light momentum and energy constitute a Lorentz four-vector in a
form of single EM-field cell or single photon, and Planck constant is a Lorentz
invariant; (c) there is no momentum transfer taking place between the plane
wave and the uniform medium, and the EM momentum conservation equation cannot
be uniquely determined without resorting to the principle of relativity; and
(d) when the medium moves opposite to the wave vector at a
faster-than-dielectric light speed, negative frequency and negative EM energy
density occur, with the plane wave becoming left-handed. Finally, a new physics
of so-called ""intrinsic Lorentz violation"" is presented as well.

frequency (RF) chains and phase shifters (PSs) such that the proposed HB
achieves the same performance as that of the digital beamforming (DB) which
utilizes $N$ (number of transmitter antennas) RF chains. We show that the
performance of the DB can be achieved with our HB just by utilizing $r_t$ RF
chains and $2r_t(N-r_t + 1)$ PSs, where $r_t \leq N$ is the rank of the
combined digital precoder matrices of all sub-carriers. Second, we provide a
simple and novel approach to reduce the number of PSs with only a negligible
performance degradation. Numerical results reveal that only $20-40$ PSs per RF
chain are sufficient for practically relevant parameter settings. Finally, for
the scenario where the deployed number of RF chains $(N_a)$ is less than $r_t$,
we propose a simple user scheduling algorithm to select the best set of users
in each sub-carrier. Simulation results validate theoretical expressions, and
demonstrate the superiority of the proposed HB design over the existing HB
designs in both flat fading and frequency selective channels.

wireless transmission and provides good maximum system capacity by getting the
advantages of both MIMO and OFDM. The main problem in this system is that
increase in number of transmit and receive antennas lead to hardware
complexity. To tackle this issue, an effective optimal transmit antenna subset
selection method is proposed in paper with the aid of Adaptive Mutation Genetic
Algorithm (AGA). Here, the selection of transmit antenna subsets are done by
the adaptive mutation of Genetic Algorithm in MIMO-OFDM system. For all the
mutation points, the fitness function are evaluated and from that value, best
fitness based mutation points are chosen. After the selection of best mutation
points, the mutation process is carried out, accordingly. The implementation of
proposed work is done in the working platform MATLAB and the performance are
evaluated with various selection of transmit antenna subsets. Moreover, the
comparison results between the existing GA with mutation and the proposed GA
with adaptive mutation are discussed. Hence, using the proposed work, the
selection of transmit antenna with the maximum capacity is made and which leads
to the reduced hardware complexity and undisturbed data rate in the MIMO-OFDM
