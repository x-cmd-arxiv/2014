we prove quenched disorder chaos for the bond overlap in the Edwards-Anderson
type models with Gaussian disorder. The proof extends to systems at different
temperatures and covers a number of other models, such as the mixed $p$-spin
model, Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model with multi-dimensional spins and diluted
$p$-spin model. Next, we adapt the same idea to prove quenched self-averaging
of the bond magnetization for one system and use it to show quenched
self-averaging of the site overlap for random field models with positively
correlated spins. Finally, we show self-averaging for certain modifications of
the random field itself.

streaming model of computation. At one extreme, there is a trivial
$2$-approximation for this problem that uses only $O(\log n)$ space, namely,
count the number of edges and output half of this value as the estimate for max
cut value. On the other extreme, if one allows $\tilde{O}(n)$ space, then a
near-optimal solution to the max cut value can be obtained by storing an
$\tilde{O}(n)$-size sparsifier that essentially preserves the max cut. An
intriguing question is if poly-logarithmic space suffices to obtain a
non-trivial approximation to the max-cut value (that is, beating the factor
$2$). It was recently shown that the problem of estimating the size of a
maximum matching in a graph admits a non-trivial approximation in
poly-logarithmic space.
  Our main result is that any streaming algorithm that breaks the
$2$-approximation barrier requires $\tilde{\Omega}(\sqrt{n})$ space even if the
edges of the input graph are presented in random order. Our result is obtained
by exhibiting a distribution over graphs which are either bipartite or
$\frac{1}{2}$-far from being bipartite, and establishing that
$\tilde{\Omega}(\sqrt{n})$ space is necessary to differentiate between these
two cases. Thus as a direct corollary we obtain that $\tilde{\Omega}(\sqrt{n})$
space is also necessary to test if a graph is bipartite or $\frac{1}{2}$-far
from being bipartite.
  We also show that for any $\epsilon > 0$, any streaming algorithm that
obtains a $(1 + \epsilon)$-approximation to the max cut value when edges arrive
in adversarial order requires $n^{1 - O(\epsilon)}$ space, implying that
$\Omega(n)$ space is necessary to obtain an arbitrarily good approximation to
the max cut value.

weighted bipartite graph where $V_1$ is known beforehand and the vertices of
$V_2$ arrive online. The goal is to match vertices of $V_2$ as they arrive to
vertices in $V_1$, so as to maximize the sum of weights of edges in the
matching. If assignments to $V_1$ cannot be changed, no bounded competitive
ratio is achievable. We study the weighted online matching problem with {\em
free disposal}, where vertices in $V_1$ can be assigned multiple times, but
only get credit for the maximum weight edge assigned to them over the course of
the algorithm. For this problem, the greedy algorithm is $0.5$-competitive and
determining whether a better competitive ratio is achievable is a well known
open problem.
  We identify an interesting special case where the edge weights are
decomposable as the product of two factors, one corresponding to each end point
of the edge. This is analogous to the well studied related machines model in
the scheduling literature, although the objective functions are different. For
this case of decomposable edge weights, we design a 0.5664 competitive
randomized algorithm in complete bipartite graphs. We show that such instances
with decomposable weights are non-trivial by establishing upper bounds of 0.618
for deterministic and $0.8$ for randomized algorithms.
  A tight competitive ratio of $1-1/e \approx 0.632$ was known previously for
both the 0-1 case as well as the case where edge weights depend on the offline
vertices only, but for these cases, reassignments cannot change the quality of
the solution. Beating 0.5 for weighted matching where reassignments are
necessary has been a significant challenge. We thus give the first online
algorithm with competitive ratio strictly better than 0.5 for a non-trivial
case of weighted matching with free disposal.

of physical systems. Unlike the standard approaches (Schrodinger-Heisenberg,
Feynman, Wigner-Gronewald-Moyal), the process approach is not merely equivalent
to NRQM and is not merely a re-interpretation. The process approach provides a
dynamical completion of NRQM. Standard NRQM arises as a asymptotic quotient by
means of a set-valued process covering map, which links the process algebra to
the usual space of wave functions and operators on Hilbert space. The process
approach offers an emergentist, discrete, finite, quasi-non-local and
quasi-non-contextual realist interpretation which appears to resolve many of
the paradoxes and is free of divergences. Nevertheless, it retains the
computational power of NRQM and possesses an emergent probability structure
which agrees with NRQM in the asymptotic quotient. The paper describes the
process algebra, the process covering map for single systems and the
configuration process covering map for multiple systems. It demonstrates the
link to NRQM through a toy model. Applications of the process algebra to
various quantum mechanical situations - superpositions, two-slit experiments,
entanglement, Schrodinger's cat - are presented along with an approach to the
paradoxes and the issue of classicality.

scheme developed by Damanik and Goldstein for the special case $\mathfrak{T} =
\mathbb{Z}^\nu$. Our main motivation for working out this extension comes from
an application to matrix functions which are dual to certain Hill operators.
These operators take the form $H_{\tilde\omega}=-\frac{d^2}{dx^2} + \varepsilon
U(\tilde\omega x)$, where $U$ is a real smooth function on the torus
$\mathbb{T}^\nu$, $\tilde\omega\in \mathbb{R}^\nu$ is a vector with rational
components, and $\varepsilon$ is a small parameter. The group in this
particular case is the quotient $\mathfrak{T} =
\mathbb{Z}^\nu/\{m\in\mathbb{Z}^\nu:m\tilde\omega=0\}$. We show that the
general theory indeed applies to this special case, provided that the rational
frequency vector $\tilde\omega$ obeys a suitable Diophantine condition in a
large box of modes. Despite the fact that in this setting the orbits $k +
m\omega$, $k \in \mathbb{R}$, $m\in\mathbb{Z}^\nu$ are not dense, the dual
eigenfunctions are exponentially localized and the eigenvalues of the operators
can be described as $E(k+m\omega)$ with $E(k)$ being a ""nice"" monotonic
function of the impulse $k \ge 0$. This enables us to derive a description of
the Floquet solutions and the band-gap structure of the spectrum, which we will
use in a companion paper to develop a complete inverse spectral theory for the
Sturm-Liouville equation with small quasi-periodic potential via periodic
approximation of the frequency. The analysis of the gaps in the range of the
function $E(k)$ plays a crucial role in this approach.

natural framework for the parameterization of the corresponding ground state

tensors. Topological order is reflected in the symmetries of these tensors, and
we give a characterization of those symmetries in terms of matrix product
operators acting on the virtual level. This leads to a set of algebraic rules
characterizing states with topological quantum order. The corresponding matrix
product operators fully encode all topological features of the theory, and
provide a systematic way of constructing topological states. We generalize the
conditions of $\mathsf{G}$ and twisted injectivity to the matrix product
operator case, and provide a complete picture of the ground state manifold on
the torus. As an example, we show how all string-net models of Levin and Wen
fit within this formalism, and in doing so provide a particularly intuitive
interpretation of the pentagon equation for F-symbols as the pulling of certain
matrix product operators through the string-net tensor network. Our approach

acting isometrically on Gromov hyperbolic metric spaces. Our work unifies and
extends a long list of results by many authors. We make it a point to avoid any
assumption of properness/compactness, keeping in mind the motivating example of
$\mathbb H^\infty$, the infinite-dimensional rank-one symmetric space of
noncompact type over the reals. The monograph provides a number of examples of
groups acting on $\mathbb H^\infty$ which exhibit a wide range of phenomena not
to be found in the finite-dimensional theory. Such examples often demonstrate
the optimality of our theorems. We introduce a modification of the Poincar\'e
exponent, an invariant of a group which gives more information than the usual
Poincar\'e exponent, which we then use to vastly generalize the Bishop--Jones
theorem relating the Hausdorff dimension of the radial limit set to the
Poincar\'e exponent of the underlying semigroup. We give some examples based on
our results which illustrate the connection between Hausdorff dimension and
various notions of discreteness which show up in non-proper settings. We
construct Patterson--Sullivan measures for groups of divergence type without
any compactness assumption. This is carried out by first constructing such
measures on the Samuel--Smirnov compactification of the bordification of the
underlying hyperbolic space, and then showing that the measures are supported
on the bordification. We study quasiconformal measures of geometrically finite
groups in terms of (a) doubling and (b) exact dimensionality. Our analysis
characterizes exact dimensionality in terms of Diophantine approximation on the
boundary. We demonstrate that some Patterson--Sullivan measures are neither
doubling nor exact dimensional, and some are exact dimensional but not
doubling, but all doubling measures are exact dimensional.

a one-component satellite that is moving on a highly eccentric orbit in the
external field of a host galaxy potential like our own. The results show that
every time the satellite approaches apogalacticon, a fresh pair of tidal tails
becomes notably prominent, and that eventually, the satellite possesses
multiple tidal tails via repeating apocentre passages. Accordingly, the number
of observed tidal arms can be used as a tracer of the number of orbital periods
that such a system has completed around the centre of its host galaxy. By
identifying the arm particles included in each of the first three consecutively
formed pairs of tidal tails, we find that each pair of tidal tails is
practically identical to one another regarding the energy and angular-momentum
distributions. In addition, we demonstrate that the density profiles of these
three pairs of tidal tails at their first apogalacticons after formation agree
well with one another. It therefore follows that the multiplicity in tidal
features originates from the repeated episode of tidal-arm formation in the
course of the precessing motion of a satellite.

find that the [Fe II] line at 1.644 mu can be used to analyze the overall
chemical and density structure of the exploding WD up to day 200 without
considering B. Subsequently, positron transport and magnetic field effects
become important. By day 500, the profile becomes sensitive to the morphology
of B and directional dependent for dipole fields. Small or no directional
dependence of the spectra is found for small-scale B. After about 200 days,
persistent broad-line, flat-topped or stumpy profiles require high density
burning which is the signature of a WD close to M_Ch. Narrow peaked profiles
are a signature of chemical mixing or sub-MCh WDs. Good time coverage is
required to separate the effects of optical depth, the size and morphology of
B, and the aspect angle of the observer. The spectra require a resolution of
about 500 km/sec and a signal to noise ratio of about 20%. Line blending effect
are demonstrated at the example of equally prominent features at about 1.5 and
1.8 mu. For some SNeIa, spectra beyond day 300 have been observed which lend
support for M_Ch mass explosions in at least some cases, and require magnetic
fields equal to or in excess of 1E6G. We briefly discuss the effects of the

It is found that bifurcations in the dynamics of $\zeta_\lambda(x)$, $x\in

dynamics of the family becomes chaotic when the parameter $\lambda$ crosses

promising candidate for realizing exotic spin liquid phases. Recently, there
has been a lot of renewed interest in these systems with the discovery of
materials such as Volborthite and Herbertsmithite that have Kagome like
structures. In the presence of an external magnetic field, these frustrated
systems can give rise to magnetization plateaus of which the plateau at
$m=\frac{1}{3}$ is considered to be the most prominent. Here we study the
problem of the antiferromagnetic spin-1/2 quantum XXZ Heisenberg model on a
Kagome lattice by using a Jordan-Wigner transformation that maps the spins onto
a problem of fermions coupled to a Chern-Simons gauge field. This mapping
relies on being able to define a consistent Chern-Simons term on the lattice.
Using a recently developed method to rigorously extend the Chern-Simons term to
the frustrated Kagome lattice we can now formalize the Jordan-Wigner
transformation on the Kagome lattice. We then discuss the possible phases that
can arise at the mean-field level from this mapping and focus specifically on
the case of $\frac{1}{3}$-filling ($m=\frac{1}{3}$ plateau) and analyze the
effects of fluctuations in our theory. We show that in the regime of $XY$
anisotropy the ground state at the $1/3$ plateau is equivalent to a bosonic
fractional quantum Hall Laughlin state with filling fraction $1/2$ and that at
the $5/9$ plateau it is equivalent to the first bosonic Jain daughter state at

component in $V-S$, as an appropriate mathematical measure of resilience in the

motivation for VAT was the observation that, whereas conductance, $\Phi(G)$,
captures both edge based and node based resilience for regular graphs,
conductance fails to capture node based resilience for heterogeneous degree
distributions. We had previously demonstrated an upper bound on VAT via
conductance for the case of $d$-regular graphs $G$ as follows: $\tau(G) \le

the incompressibility constraint. In this paper, we develop a mathematical
correspondence between Newtonian fluids in the incompressible limit and
hypo-elastoplastic solids in the slow, quasi-static limit. Using this

two-dimensional plane strain simple shear simulation, the method is in
quantitative agreement with an explicit method. Like the fluid projection
method, it is efficient and numerically robust, making it practical for a wide

famous paper by Wolpert and Macready, and then subsequently refined and
extended by several authors, always in the context of a set of functions with
discrete domain and codomain. Recently, Auger and Teytaud have shown that for
continuum domains there is typically no No-Free-Lunch theorems. In this paper
we provide another approach, which is simpler, requires less assumptions,
relates the discrete and continuum cases, and that we believe that clarifies
the role of the cardinality and structure of the domain.

consistent with the PKE, spin-polarized neutron scattering, and optical
anisotropy measurements. Spontaneous currents in this model flow between the
in-plane and apical oxygens in such a manner that each oxygen belongs to one
current loop. This loop-current pattern is similar to the spin order in the
magnetoelectric antiferromagnet Cr2O3, where the PKE is observed
experimentally. By analogy, it should be possible to train the PKE sign in the

anomalous Hall effect, and the second-harmonic generation.

detectability occurs as the inter-community edge connection probability $p$
grows. This phase transition separates a sub-critical regime of small $p$,

communities, from a super-critical regime of large $p$ where successful
community detection is impossible. We show that, as the community sizes become
large, the asymptotic phase transition threshold $p^*$ is equal to
$\sqrt{p_1\cdot p_2}$, where $p_i~(i=1,2)$ is the within-community edge

Same content with different formatting",,,,"quant-ph cs.CR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Shor's quantum factoring algorithm and a few other efficient quantum
algorithms break many classical crypto-systems. In response, people proposed
post-quantum cryptography based on computational problems that are believed
hard even for quantum computers. However, security of these schemes against
\emph{quantum} attacks is elusive. This is because existing security analysis
(almost) only deals with classical attackers and arguing security in the
presence of quantum adversaries is challenging due to unique quantum features
such as no-cloning.
  This work proposes a general framework to study which classical security
proofs can be restored in the quantum setting. Basically, we split a security
proof into (a sequence of) classical security reductions, and investigate what
security reductions are ""quantum-friendly"". We characterize sufficient
conditions such that a classical reduction can be ""lifted"" to the quantum
setting. We then apply our lifting theorems to post-quantum signature schemes.
We are able to show that the classical generic construction of hash-tree based
signatures from one-way functions and and a more efficient variant proposed
in~\cite{BDH11} carry over to the quantum setting. Namely, assuming existence
of (classical) one-way functions that are resistant to efficient quantum
inversion algorithms, there exists a quantum-secure signature scheme. We note
that the scheme in~\cite{BDH11} is a promising (post-quantum) candidate to be
implemented in practice and our result further justifies it. Finally we
demonstrate the generality of our framework by showing that several existing
works (Full-Domain hash in the quantum random-oracle model~\cite{Zha12ibe} and
the simple hybrid arguments framework in~\cite{HSS11}) can be reformulated
under our unified framework.

film hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) solar photovoltaic cells using a
three-dimensional silver array of multi-resonant nano-disk structures embedded
in a silicon nitride anti-reflection coating (ARC) to enhance optical
absorption in the intrinsic layer (i-a-Si:H) for the visible spectrum for any
polarization angle. Predicted total optical enhancement (OE) in absorption in
the i-a-Si:H for AM-1.5 solar spectrum is 18.51% as compared to the reference,
and producing a 19.65% improvement in short-circuit current density (JSC) over
11.7 mA/cm2 for a reference cell. The JSC in the nano-disk patterned solar cell
(NDPSC) was found to be higher than the commercial reference structure for any
incident angle. The NDPSC has a multi-resonant optical response for the visible
spectrum and the associated mechanism for OE in i-a-Si:H layer is excitation of
Fabry-Perot resonance facilitated by surface plasmon resonances. The
detrimental Staebler-Wronski effect (SWE) in a-Si:H solar cell can be minimized
by the additional OE in the NDPSC and self-annealing of defect states by
additional heat generation, thus likely improving the overall stabilized
characteristics of a-Si:H solar cells.

to the famous no-cloning theorem. Approximate cloning schemes have been
proposed to achieve the optimal cloning characterized by the maximal fidelity
between the original and its copies. Here, from the perspective of quantum
Fisher information (QFI), we investigate the distribution of QFI in asymmetric
cloning machines which produce two nonidentical copies. As one might expect,
improving the QFI of one copy results in decreasing the QFI of the other copy,
roughly the same as that of fidelity. It is perhaps also unsurprising that
asymmetric phase-covariant cloning machine outperforms universal cloning
machine in distributing QFI since a priori information of the input state has
been utilized. However, interesting results appear when we compare the
distributabilities of fidelity (which quantifies the full information of
quantum states), and QFI (which only captures the information of relevant
parameters) in asymmetric cloning machines. In contrast to the results of
fidelity, where the distributability of symmetric cloning is always optimal for
any d-dimensional cloning, we find that asymmetric cloning performs always
better than symmetric cloning on the distribution of QFI for $d\leq18$, but
this conclusion becomes invalid when $d>18$.

In the context of quantum estimation theory, it is of great significance to

Here we investigate the multiple phase estimation problem for a natural

this process from a novel perspective, the timing. We calculated the time of

with the $a_{0}(980)$-$f_{0}(980)$ mixing intensity from the viewpoint of
compositeness, which corresponds to the amount of two-body states composing
resonances as well as bound states. For this purpose we first formulate the
$a_{0}(980)$-$f_{0}(980)$ mixing intensity as the ratio of two partial decay
widths of a parent particle, in the same manner as the recent analysis in BES
experiments. Calculating the $a_{0}(980)$-$f_{0}(980)$ mixing intensity with
the existing Flatte parameters from experiments, we find that many combinations
of the $a_{0}(980)$ and $f_{0}(980)$ Flatte parameters can reproduce the
experimental value of the $a_{0}(980)$-$f_{0}(980)$ mixing intensity by BES.
Next, from the same Flatte parameters we also calculate the $K \bar{K}$
compositeness for $a_{0}(980)$ and $f_{0}(980)$. Although the compositeness
with the correct normalization becomes complex in general for resonance states,
we find that the Flatte parameters for $f_{0}(980)$ imply large absolute value
of the $K \bar{K}$ compositeness and the parameters for $a_{0}(980)$ lead to
small but nonnegligible absolute value of the $K \bar{K}$ compositeness. Then,
connecting the mixing intensity and the $K \bar{K}$ compositeness via the
$a_{0}(980)$- and $f_{0}(980)$-$K \bar{K}$ coupling constants, we establish a
relation between them. As a result, a small mixing intensity indicates a small
value of the product of the $K \bar{K}$ compositeness for the $a_{0}(980)$ and
$f_{0}(980)$ resonances. Moreover, the experimental value of the
$a_{0}(980)$-$f_{0}(980)$ mixing intensity implies that the $a_{0}(980)$ and
$f_{0}(980)$ resonances cannot be simultaneously $K \bar{K}$ molecular states.

infers a spatially distributed physical attribute based on observations of

data-generating field processes, known as ''forward processes'', are usually
nonlinear with respect to the spatial attribute, and are often defined
non-analytically by a numerical model. The data often contain a large number of
elements with significant inter-correlation. We propose a general statistical
method to tackle this problem. The method is centered on a parameterization
device called ''anchors'' and an iterative algorithm for deriving the
distribution of anchors conditional on the observed data. The algorithm draws
upon techniques of importance sampling and multivariate kernel density
estimation with weighted samples. Anchors are selected automatically; the
selection evolves in iterations in a way that is tailored to important features
of the attribute field. The method and the algorithm are general with respect
to the scientific nature and technical details of the forward processes.
Conceptual and technical components render the method in contrast to standard
approaches that are based on regularization or optimization. Some important
features of the proposed method are demonstrated by examples from the earth
sciences, including groundwater flow, rainfall-runoff, and seismic tomography.

angular power spectrum and on the two-point correlation function in

the relativistic effects since it naturally makes use of the symmetries of the

in the RCW 82 H {\small II} region. In the framework of a classical trigger
model the estimated time of fragmentation is larger than the estimated age of
the H {\small II} region. Thus the young objects could not have formed during
the dynamical evolution of the H {\small II} region. We propose a new model
that helps resolve this problem. This model suggests that the H {\small II}
region RCW 82 is embedded in a cloud of limited size that is denser than the
surrounding interstellar medium. According to this model, when the
ionization--shock front leaves the cloud it causes the formation of an
accelerating dense gas shell. In the accelerated shell, the effects of the
Rayleigh--Taylor (R-T) instability dominate and the characteristic time of the
growth of perturbations with the observed magnitude of about 3 pc is 0.14 Myr,
which is less than the estimated age of the H {\small II} region. The total
time $t_{\sum}$, which is the sum of the expansion time of the H {\small II}
region to the edge of the cloud, the time of the R-T instability growth, and
the free fall time, is estimated as $0.44<t_{\sum} < 0.78$ Myr. We conclude
that the young objects in the H {\small II} region RCW 82 could be formed as a
result of the R-T instability with subsequent fragmentation into large-scale
condensations.

will soon be in operation on the European Very Large Telescope. Such an
instrument relies on an extreme adaptive optics system coupled with a
coronagraph that suppresses most of the diffracted stellar light. However, the
coronagraph performance is strongly limited by quasi-static aberrations that
create long-lived speckles in the scientific image plane, which can easily be
mistaken for planets. The ultimate performance is thus limited by the
unavoidable differential aberrations between the wave-front sensor and the
scientific camera, which have to be estimated andcompensated for. In this
paper, we use the COFFEE approach to measure and compensate for SPHERE's
quasi-static aberrations. COFFEE (for COronagraphic Focal-plane wave-Front
Estimation for Exoplanet detection), which consists in an extension of phase
diversity to coronagraphic imaging, estimates the quasi-static aberrations,
including the differential ones, using only two focal plane images recorded by
the scientific camera. In this paper, we use coronagraphic images recorded from
SPHERE's infrared detector IRDIS to estimate the aberrations upstream of the
coronagraph, which are then compensated for using SPHERE's extreme adaptive
optics loop SAXO. We first validate the ability of COFFEE to estimate
high-order aberrations by estimating a calibrated influence function pattern
introduced upstream of the coronagraph. We then use COFFEE in an original
iterative compensation process to compensate for the estimated aberrations,
leading to a contrast improvement by a factor that varies from 1.4 to 4.7
between 2l/D and 15l/D on IRDIS. The performance of the compensation process is
also evaluated through simulations. An excellent match between experimental
results and these simulations is found.

current research due to the exotic properties of their elementary excitations.
In this paper we suggest a realistic experimental setup for the realization of
a simple version of such a phase. We show how delta-interacting bosons hopping
on the links of a one-dimensional (1D) ladder can be used to simulate the
thin-torus-limit of the two-dimensional (2D) Hofstadter-Hubbard model at
one-quarter magnetic flux per plaquette. Bosons can be confined to ladders by
optical superlattices, and synthetic magnetic fields can be realized by far
off-resonant Raman beams. We show that twisted boundary conditions can be
implemented, enabling the realization of a fractionally quantized Thouless
pump. Using numerical density-matrix-renormalization-group (DMRG) calculations
we show that the groundstate of our model is an incompressible
symmetry-protected topological charge density wave (CDW) phase at average
filling $\rho = 1/8$ per lattice site, related to the 1/2 Laughlin-type state
of the corresponding 2D model.

proposed as a candidate magnetic cataclysmic variable of the polar type from
optical spectroscopy. Using XMM-Newton we perform detailed timing and spectral
analysis with simultaneous X-ray ($0.3-10$ keV) and optical B band data. We
complement the spectral study with archival hard X-ray (14-70 keV) spectra
collected by Swift BAT as well as with optical, near and mid-infrared
photometry from $SDSS$, $2MASS$ and $WISE$ archive, respectively. A strong
periodic X-ray signal at 2.16 h, consistent with the recently determined
spectroscopic orbital period, adds Swift J2218.4+1925 to the small group of
hard X-ray polars and locates it at the low edge of the orbital period gap. The
X-ray pulse profile shows the typical bright and faint phases seen in polars
($\sim 70%$ and $\sim 30%$ of the orbit, respectively). A pronounced dip
centred on the bright phase is also detected. It is stronger at lower energies
and is mainly produced by photoelectric absorption. A binary inclination $i
\sim 40^o - 50^o$ and a magnetic colatitude $\beta \sim 55^o - 64^o$ are
estimated. The source appears to accrete over a large area $\sim 24^o$ wide. A
multi-temperature optically thin emission with complex absorption well
describes the broad-band ($0.3-70$ keV) spectrum, with no signs of a soft X-ray
blackbody component. The spectral shape varies with the source rotation
reaching plasma temperatures up to 55 keV, hardening at the dip and being
softer during the faint phase ($\sim7$ keV). We find the first indication of an
absorption edge due to a warm absorber in a polar. Indication of overabundance
of neon is found in the RGS spectra. The UV to mid-IR spectral energy
distribution reveals an excess in the near and mid-IR, likely due to low
cyclotron harmonics. We estimate a WD mass of 0.97 M$_{\odot}$ and a distance
of 230-250 pc.

The analysis of the ESO:HARPS archived spectra is presented. The sample being
analysed (AMBRE:HARPS) covers the period from 2003 to 2010 and is comprised of
126688 scientific spectra corresponding to 17218 different stars. For the
analysis of the spectral sample, the automated pipeline developed for the

characteristics of the HARPS spectra. Within the pipeline, the stellar
parameters are determined by the MATISSE algorithm, developed at OCA for the
analysis of large samples of stellar spectra in the framework of galactic
archaeology. In the present application, MATISSE uses the AMBRE grid of
synthetic spectra, which covers FGKM-type stars for a range of gravities and
metallicities. We first determined the radial velocity and its associated error
for the ~15% of the AMBRE:HARPS spectra, for which this velocity had not been
derived by the ESO:HARPS reduction pipeline. The stellar atmospheric parameters
and the associated chemical index [alpha/Fe] with their associated errors have
then been estimated for all the spectra of the AMBRE:HARPS archived sample.
Based on quality criteria, we accepted and delivered the parameterisation of
~71% of the total sample to ESO. These spectra correspond to ~10706 stars; each
are observed between one and several hundred times. This automatic
parameterisation of the AMBRE:HARPS spectra shows that the large majority of
these stars are cool main-sequence dwarfs with metallicities greater than -0.5
dex.

This approach can differentiate and recognize various routes taken by the user
by time warping angular speeds experienced by the phone while in transit and is
independent of phone orientation and location within the vehicle, small detours

samples covering large portions of the Milky Way to infer the dominant
processes involved in its formation and evolution, is now a powerful method
thanks to the large recently completed and ongoing spectroscopic surveys. It is
now important to ask the right questions when analyzing and interpreting the
information contained in these rich datasets. To this aim, we have developed a
chemodynamical model for the Milky Way that provides quantitative predictions
to be compared with the chemo-kinematical properties extracted from the stellar
spectra. Three key parameters are needed to make the comparison between data
and model predictions useful in order to advance in the field, namely: precise
proper-motions, distances and ages. The uncertainties involved in the estimate
of ages and distances for field stars are currently the main obstacles in the
Galactic Archaeology method. Two important developments might change this
situation in the near future: asteroseismology and the now launched Gaia. When
combined with the large datasets from surveys like RAVE, SEGUE, LAMOST,
Gaia-ESO, APOGEE , HERMES and the future 4MOST we will have the basic
ingredients for the reconstruction of the MW history in hands. In the light of
these observational advances, the development of detailed chemo-dynamical
models tailored to the Milky Way is urgently needed in the field. Here we show
the steps we have taken, both in terms of data analysis and modelling. The
examples shown here illustrate how powerful can the Galactic Archaeology method
become once ages and distances are known with better precision than what is
currently feasible.

Kovacs (1996) has shown that RR Lyrae light curves and the phase difference of
their Fourier decomposition, {\phi}31, can be used to estimate photometric

We investigate how small a gradient would be detectable within the current S/N
levels of the present data set, given the random and systematic errors
associated with the derivation of a photometric metallicity versus spatial

approach for non-linear dimensionality reduction that has been widely applied.
However, the current approach for training GP-LVMs is based on maximum
likelihood, where the latent projection variables are maximized over rather
than integrated out. In this paper we present a Bayesian method for training
GP-LVMs by introducing a non-standard variational inference framework that
allows to approximately integrate out the latent variables and subsequently
train a GP-LVM by maximizing an analytic lower bound on the exact marginal
likelihood. We apply this method for learning a GP-LVM from iid observations
and for learning non-linear dynamical systems where the observations are
temporally correlated. We show that a benefit of the variational Bayesian
procedure is its robustness to overfitting and its ability to automatically
select the dimensionality of the nonlinear latent space. The resulting
framework is generic, flexible and easy to extend for other purposes, such as
Gaussian process regression with uncertain inputs and semi-supervised Gaussian
processes. We demonstrate our method on synthetic data and standard machine
learning benchmarks, as well as challenging real world datasets, including high
resolution video data.

\overline{\nu}$ decays is predicted to be extremely small. Therefore,
observation of any of these mesons ($M^0$) decaying into an invisible final
state would signal the presence of new physics. The Bell-Steinberger relation
connects CP and CPT violation in the mass matrix to CP and CPT violation in all
decay channels of neutral kaons. It is a powerful tool for testing CPT
invariance in the $K^0-\overline{K}^0$ system, assuming that there are no
significant undiscovered decay modes of either $K_S$ or $K_L$ which could
contribute to the precision of the results. The $K_S,K_L\to invisible$ decays
have never been tested and the question of how much these decays can influence
the Bell-Steinberger analysis of the kaon system still remains open. In the
present work we propose a new experiment to search for the $M^0\to invisible$
decays which aims at probing new physics and answering this question. The
experiment utilizes high energy hadronic beams from the CERN SPS and the charge
exchange reactions of pion or kaon on nucleons of an active target, e.g. $\pi^-
(K^-) + p\to M^0 + n $, as a source of the well-tagged $M^0$s emitted with the
beam energy. If the decay $M^0\to invisible$ exists, it could be observed by
looking for an excess of events with a specific signature: the complete
disappearance of the beam energy in the detector. This unique signal of $M^0\to
invisible$ decays allows for searches of the decays $K_S,K_L\to invisible$ with
a sensitivity in branching ratio Br$(K_S (K_L)\to invisible) \lesssim 10^{-8}
(10^{-6})$, and $\pi^0,\eta, \eta' \to invisible$ decays with a sensitivity a
few orders of magnitude beyond the present experimental limits. This experiment
is complementary to the one recently proposed for the search for invisible
decays of dark photons and fits well with the present kaon program at CERN.

individual sources using high cadence observations of PSR B1937+21. The data
were acquired from an intensive observation campaign with the Lovell telescope
at Jodrell Bank, between June 2011 and May 2013. The almost daily cadence
achieved, allowed us to be sensitive to GWs with frequencies up to
$4.98\times10^{-6}\,\rm {Hz}$, extending the upper bound of the typical
frequency range probed by Pulsar Timing Arrays. We used observations taken at
three different radio frequencies with the Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope
in order to correct for dispersion measure effects and scattering variances.
The corrected timing residuals exhibited an unmodeled periodic noise with an
amplitude $~150\,\rm {ns}$ and a frequency of $3.4\rm {yr}^{-1}$. As the signal
is not present in the entire data set, we attributed it to the rotational
behaviour of the pulsar, ruling out the possibilities of being either due to a
GW or an asteroid as the cause. After removing this noise component, we placed
limits on the GW strain of individual sources equaling to $h_{\rm
s}=1.53\times10^{-11}$ and $h_{\rm s}=4.99\times10^{-14}$ at $10^{-7}\,\rm

two-loop SUSY-QCD radiative corrections required in the decoupling process. The
method has the advantage that large logarithmic corrections are automatically
resummed through the Renormalization Group Equations. As phenomenological
application we study the effects of this approach on the prediction of the
lightest Higgs boson mass at three-loop accuracy. We observe a significant
reduction of the renormalization scale dependence as compared to the direct
method, that is based on the conversion relation between the running and pole
mass for the top quark. The effect of resummation of large logarithmic
contributions consists in an increased prediction for the Higgs boson mass, an
observation in agreement with the previous analyses.

  Rates",,,,,"q-bio.PE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The evolution of the allelic proportion $x$ of a biallelic locus subject to
the forces of mutation and drift is investigated in a diffusion model, assuming
small scaled mutation rates. The overall scaled mutation rate is parametrized
with $\theta=(\mu_1+\mu_0)N$ and the ratio of mutation rates with
$\alpha=\mu_1/(\mu_1+\mu_0)=1-\beta$. The equilibrium density of this process
is beta with parameters $\alpha\theta$ and $\beta\theta$. Away from
equilibrium, the transition density can be expanded into a series of modified
Jacobi polynomials. If the scaled mutation rates are small, i.e., $\theta \ll
1$, it may be assumed that polymorphism derives from mutations at the
boundaries. A model, where the interior dynamics conform to the pure drift
diffusion model and the mutations are entering from the boundaries is derived.
In equilibrium, the density of the proportion of polymorphic alleles, \ie\ $x$
within the polymorphic region $[1/N,1-1/N]$, is
$\alpha\beta\theta(\tfrac1x+\tfrac1{1-x})=\tfrac{\alpha\beta\theta}{x(1-x)}$,
while the mutation bias $\alpha$ influences the proportion of monomorphic
alleles at 0 and 1. Analogous to the expansion with modified Jacobi
polynomials, a series expansion of the transition density is derived, which is
connected to Kimura's well known solution of the pure drift model using
Gegenbauer polynomials. Two temporal and two spatial regions are separated. The
eigenvectors representing the spatial component within the polymorphic region
depend neither on the on the scaled mutation rate $\theta$ nor on the mutation
bias $\alpha$. Therefore parameter changes, e.g., growing or shrinking
populations or changes in the mutation bias, can be modeled relatively easily,
without the change of the eigenfunctions necessary for the series expansion
with Jacobi polynomials.

electron and hole pockets near the Fermi level. At the fundamental level,
though many theoretical models were constructed on the basis of the so-called
1-Fe Brillouin zone (BZ) with an emphasis of the basic square lattice of iron
atoms, most electronic structure measurements were interpreted in the 2-Fe BZ.
Whether the 1-Fe BZ is valid in a real system is still an open question. Using
angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), here we show in an extremely

electronic spectral weight follows the 1-Fe BZ, and that the emerging band

structures of the 1-Fe BZ. Our analysis suggests that the interlayer separation
is an important tuning factor for the physics of FeAs layers, the increase of
which can reduce the coupling between Fe and As and lead to the emergence of
the electronic structure in accord with the 1-Fe symmetry of the Fe square
lattice. Our finding puts strong constraints on the theoretical models

parameter does not show any appreciable variation with increase of pressure up
to 2.7 kbar. Above this pressure value, a decrease in a is observed. The c
lattice parameter decreases slowly up to 1 kbar, then decreases sharply up to
20 kbar. It does not show any significant variation with further pressure
increase up to 50 kbar. The response of the lattice parameters to the applied
pressure is strongly anisotropic as the interlayer spacing (along the c-axis)
shows a significantly larger contraction than the a-b plane. The experimental
pressure dependence of the volume data is fitted to a bulk modulus, B0, of 1050
(20) kbar over the pressure range 0-1 kbar, and to 154 (2) kbar in the range
1-50 kbar. The change in the slope of the lattice parameters at 1 kbar is also
supported by high-pressure Raman measurements, which indicate a phase
transition at 1 kbar. Probably arising from a change in the CN ordering within
the Ni(CN)2 layers. Raman measurements, performed up to 200 kbar, highlight the
possible existence of a second phase transition taking place at about 70 kbar.

definition and computation of semantic diff operators for model comparison,
operators whose input consists of two models and whose output is a set of diff
witnesses, instances of one model that are not instances of the other. However,
in many cases the complete set of diff witnesses is too large to be efficiently

propose to address this challenge using a summarization technique, based on a
notion of equivalence that partitions the set of diff witnesses. The result of
the computation is a summary set, consisting of a single representative witness

(CDs) to Alloy. Unlike existing translations, which are based on a shallow
embedding strategy, and are thus limited to checking consistency and generating
conforming object models of a single CD, and support a limited set of CD
language features, CD2Alloy uses a deeper embedding strategy. Rather than
mapping each CD construct to a semantically equivalent Alloy construct,
CD2Alloy defines (some) CD constructs as new concepts within Alloy. This
enables solving several analysis problems that involve more than one CD and
could not be solved by earlier works, and supporting an extended list of CD
language features. The ideas are implemented in a prototype Eclipse plug-in.
The work advances the state-of-the-art in CD analysis, and can also be viewed
as an interesting case study for the different possible translations of one
modeling language to another, their strengths and weaknesses.

glance to discuss the case of fluid mechanics. However, there are many deep
open questions that come with the theory of fluid mechanics. In this paper, we
discuss some of them that we classify in two categories, the long term behavior
of solutions of equations of hydrodynamics and the definition of initial
(boundary) conditions. The first set of questions come with the
non-relativistic theory based on the Navier-Stokes equations. Starting from
smooth initial conditions, the purpose is to understand if solutions of
Navier-Stokes equations remain smooth with the time evolution. Existence for
just a finite time would imply the evolution of finite time singularities,
which would have a major influence on the development of turbulent phenomena.
The second set of questions come with the relativistic theory of hydrodynamics.
There is an accumulating evidence that this theory may be relevant for the
description of the medium created in high energy heavy-ion collisions. However,
this is not clear that the fundamental hypotheses of hydrodynamics are valid in
this context. Also, the determination of initial conditions remains
questionable. The purpose of this paper is to explore some ideas related to
these questions, both in the non-relativistic and relativistic limits of fluid
mechanics. We believe that these ideas do not concern only the theory side but
can also be useful for interpreting results from experimental measurements.

$Chlamydomonas$ to multicellular $Volvox$, have emerged as model organisms for
a number of problems in biological fluid dynamics. These include flagellar
propulsion, nutrient uptake by swimming organisms, hydrodynamic interactions
mediated by walls, collective dynamics and transport within suspensions of
microswimmers, the mechanism of phototaxis, and the stochastic dynamics of
flagellar synchronization. Green algae are well suited to the study of such
problems because of their range of sizes (from 10 $\mu$m to several
millimetres), their geometric regularity, the ease with which they can be
cultured and the availability of many mutants that allow for connections
between molecular details and organism-level behavior. This review summarizes
these recent developments and highlights promising future directions in the
study of biological fluid dynamics, especially in the context of evolutionary
biology, that can take advantage of these remarkable organisms.

pulsating sdB stars detected in the Kepler field. It features a rich g-mode
frequency spectrum, with a few low-amplitude p-modes at short periods.
  We use new ground-based low-resolution spectroscopy, and the near-continuous
2.88 year Kepler lightcurve, to reveal that KIC7668647 consists of a subdwarf B
star with an unseen white-dwarf companion with an orbital period of 14.2d. An
orbit with a radial-velocity amplitude of 39km/s is consistently determined
from the spectra, from the orbital Doppler beaming seen by Kepler at 163ppm,
and from measuring the orbital light-travel delay of 27 by timing of the many
pulsations seen in the Kepler lightcurve. The white dwarf has a minimum mass of
0.40 M_sun.
  We use our high signal-to-noise average spectra to study the atmospheric
parameters of the sdB star, and find that nitrogen and iron have abundances
close to solar values, while helium, carbon, oxygen and silicon are
underabundant relative to the solar mixture.
  We use the full Kepler Q06--Q17 lightcurve to extract 132 significant
pulsation frequencies. Period-spacing relations and multiplet splittings allow
us to identify the modal degree L for the majority of the modes. Using the
g-mode multiplet splittings we constrain the internal rotation period at the
base of the envelope to 46-48d as a first seismic result for this star. The few
p-mode splittings may point at a slightly longer rotation period further out in
the envelope of the star.
  From mode-visibility considerations we derive that the inclination of the
rotation axis of the sdB in KIC7668647 must be around ~60 degrees.
  Furthermore, we find strong evidence for a few multiplets indicative of
degree 3 <= L <= 8, which is another novelty in sdB-star observations made
possible by Kepler.

corresponding to the lower branch of the nonlinear dispersion relation is
stable against small perturbations, the upper branch is always subject to the
modulational instability (MI). The stability and instability are verified by
direct simulations too. We analyze collective excitations on top of the stable
lower-branch state, which include a Bogoliubov-like gapless mode and a gapped
one. Analytical results are obtained for the corresponding sound velocity and
energy gap. The effect of a uniform phase gradient (superflow) on the stability
is considered too, with a conclusion that the lower-branch state becomes
unstable above a critical wavenumber of the flux. Finally, we demonstrate that
the stable 1D state may carry robust dark solitons.

i.e. the Mott exciton, and the decay of such an excitonic state via the
multimagnon emission. In spite of the large gap that requires many bosons to be
emitted, latter process is fast due to large exchange scale and strong
charge-spin coupling in planar systems. As the starting microscopic model we
consider the single-band Hubbard model, and then more realistic three-band
model for cuprates, both leading to the same minimal one. The decay rate of the
exciton is evaluated numerically via the Fermi golden rule, having consistency
also with the direct time-evolution calculation. The decay rate reveals
exponential dependence on the ratio of the Mott-Hubbard gap and the exchange
coupling - the result qualitatively reproduced also within a toy exciton-boson

Here we investigate the origin of the stars that belong to the Ursa Major
Moving Group. We present high-resolution spectroscopic observations obtained
from three different spectrographs of kinematically selected FGK stars of the
Ursa Major moving group. Stellar atmospheric parameters (Teff, log(g), xi, and
[Fe/H]) were determined using our own automatic code (StePar) which makes use
of the sensitivity of iron equivalent widths measured in the spectra. We
critically compare the StePar results with other methods (Teff values derived
using the infrared flux method and log(g) values based on Hipparcos
parallaxes). We derived the chemical abundances of 20 elements, and their
[X/Fe] ratios of all stars in the sample. We perform a differential abundance
analysis with respect to a reference star of the UMa MG (HD115043). We have
also carried out a systematic comparison of the abundance pattern of the Ursa
Major MG and the Hyades SC with the thin disc stellar abundances. Our chemical
tagging analysis indicates that the Ursa Major MG is less affected by field
star contamination than other moving groups (such as the Hyades SC). We find a
roughly solar iron composition for the finally selected stars, whereas the
[X/Fe] ratios are roughly sub-solar except for super-solar Barium abundance.We
conclude that 29 out of 44 (i.e. 66 %) candidate stars share a similar chemical
composition. In addition, we find that the abundance pattern of the Ursa Major
MG might be marginally different from that of the Hyades SC.

GW signals with all the relevant modes, for target signals with total masses
$20 M_\odot \leq M \leq 250 M_\odot$ and mass ratios $1 \leq q \leq 18$. Target
signals are constructed by matching numerical-relativity simulations describing
the late inspiral, merger and ringdown of the binary with

concentration of publications over the highly fragmented structure of partition
cells are examined for a sample of ERC grantees; (2) Proximity to customary
levels of accuracy: Differences in commonly used reference values (mean
expected number of citations per publication, and threshold number of citations
for highly cited publications) between adjacent partition cells are compared to
differences in two other dimensions: successive publication years and
successive citation window lengths. Findings from both perspectives are in
support of partition cells rather than the larger subject categories as a
journal based structure on which to construct and apply methodologies for the
assessment of highly specialized publication records such as those of
individual scientists.

compositional development of textual DSLs and their supporting tools. We use a
redundance-free definition of a readable concrete syntax and a comprehensible
abstract syntax as both representations significantly overlap in their
structure. For enhancing the usability of the abstract syntax, we added
concepts like associations and inheritance to a grammar- based definition in
order to build up arbitrary graphs (as known from metamodeling). Two modularity
concepts, grammar inheritance and embedding, are discussed. They permit
compositional language definition and thus simplify the extension of languages
based on already existing ones. We demonstrate that compositional engineering
of new languages is a useful concept when project-individual DSLs with
appropriate tool support are defined.

Hamiltonian approach, we obtain conserved charges of the solutions and find
black hole entropy still obeys the area formula and the gravitational field
equation at the black hole horizon can be cast into the first law form of black
hole thermodynamics. In grand canonical ensemble, we find that thermodynamics
and phase structure depends on the combination $k -\mu^2/4 +c_2 m^2$ in the
four dimensional case, where $\mu$ is the chemical potential and $c_2m^2$ is
the coefficient of the second term in the potential associated with graviton
mass. When it is positive, the Hawking-Page phase transition can happen, while
as it is negative, the black hole is always thermodynamically stable with a
positive capacity. In canonical ensemble, the combination turns out to be
$k+c_2m^2$ in the four dimensional case. When it is positive, a first order
phase transition can happen between small and large black holes if the charge
is less than its critical one. In higher dimensional ($n+2 \ge 5$) case, even
when the charge is absent, the small/large black hole phase transition can also
appear, the coefficients for the third ($c_3m^2$) and/or the fourth ($c_4m^2$)

channel where the communication of two interfering source-destination pairs is
aided by an additional node that has a priori knowledge of the messages to be
transmitted, which is referred to as the it cognitive relay. For this
Interference Channel with a Cognitive Relay (ICCR) In particular, for the class
of injective semi-deterministic ICCRs, a sum-rate upper bound is derived for
the general memoryless ICCR and further tightened for the Linear Deterministic
Approximation (LDA) of the Gaussian noise channel at high SNR, which disregards
the noise and focuses on the interaction among the users' signals. The capacity
region of the symmetric LDA is completely characterized except for the regime
of moderately weak interference and weak links from the CR to the destinations.
The insights gained from the analysis of the LDA are then translated back to
the symmetric Gaussian noise channel (GICCR). For the symmetric GICCR, an
approximate characterization (to within a constant gap) of the capacity region
is provided for a parameter regime where capacity was previously unknown. The
approximately optimal scheme suggests that message cognition at a relay is
beneficial for interference management as it enables simultaneous over the air
neutralization of the interference at both destinations.

leptoquarks do not induce the contact interaction studied by ATLAS, so the

the development process as well as to encounter unforeseen challenges, the
understanding and thus the explicit modeling of organizational workflows is
more important than ever. However, available tools to support this work, in
most cases force a new notation upon the company or cannot be adapted to a
given publication layout in a reasonable amount of time. Additionally,
collaboration among colleagues as well as different business units is
complicated and less supported. Since it is of vital importance for a company
to be able to change its processes fast and adapt itself to new market
situations, the need for tools supporting this evolution is equally crucial. In
this paper we present a domain specific language (DSL) developed for modeling a
company's workflows. Furthermore, the DSL is embedded in a web-based editor
providing transparent access using modern web 2.0 technologies. Results of the
DSL's as well as the editor's application to document, model, and improve
selected workflows of a German automotive manufacturer are presented.

running geometrical algorithms have been designed in order to build about 300
aggregates, containing $10^6$ spheres each one, which allowed a careful study
of the local fluctuations and an improved accuracy in the calculations of the
pair distribution $P(r)$ and structure factors $S(Q)$ of the aggregates.
  Among various parameters (Voronoi tessellation, contact coordination number
distribution,...), fluctuations were quantitatively evaluated by the direct
evaluation of the fluctuations of the local sphere number density, which
appears to follow a power law. The FWHM of the Voronoi cells volume shows a
regular variation over the whole packing fraction range.
  Dirac peaks appear on the pair correlation function as the packing fraction
of the aggregates decreases, indicating the growth of larger and larger
polytetrahedra, which manifest in two ways on the structure factor, at low and
large $Q$values. These low PF aggregates have a composite structure made of
regular polytetrahedra embedded in a more disordered matrix. Incidentally, the
irregularity index of the building tetrahedron appears as a better parameter
than the packing fraction to describe various features of the aggregates
structure.

sensor array processing to communications, speech and audio signal processing,

algorithms were originally developed for centralized, in-memory computation on
a single machine; and the few that break away from this mold do not easily
incorporate practically important constraints, such as nonnegativity. A new
constrained tensor factorization framework is proposed in this paper, building
upon the Alternating Direction method of Multipliers (ADMoM). It is shown that
this simplifies computations, bypassing the need to solve constrained
optimization problems in each iteration; and it naturally leads to distributed
algorithms suitable for parallel implementation on regular high-performance
computing (e.g., mesh) architectures. This opens the door for many emerging big
data-enabled applications. The methodology is exemplified using nonnegativity
as a baseline constraint, but the proposed framework can more-or-less readily
incorporate many other types of constraints. Numerical experiments are very
encouraging, indicating that the ADMoM-based nonnegative tensor factorization
(NTF) has high potential as an alternative to state-of-the-art approaches.

simple enough to lead to an actual understanding of the mechanisms proposed,

electron Zeeman sublevels in cuboidal GaAs quantum dots (QDs). The QDs are
subject to an in-plane magnetic field. As the field orientation varies, the
relaxation rate oscillates periodically, showing ``magic'' angles where the
relaxation rate is suppressed by several orders of magnitude. This behavior is
found in QDs with different shapes, heights, crystallographic orientations and
external fields. The origin of these angles can be traced back to the
symmetries of the spin admixing terms of the Hamiltonian. In [001] grown QDs,
the suppression angles are different for Rashba and Dresselhaus spin-orbit
terms. By contrast, in [111] grown QDs they are the same, which should
facilitate a thorough suppression of spin-orbit induced relaxation. Our results
evidence that cubic Dresselhaus terms play a critical role in determining the

in between the $\delta$ Scuti and slowly pulsating B (SPB) star instability

to host fast rotating stars. Rotation can significantly affect the pulsation
properties of stars and alter their apparent luminosity through gravity
darkening. Therefore we inspect if the new variable stars could correspond to
fast rotating SPB stars. We carry out instability and visibility analysis of
SPB pulsation modes within the frame of the traditional approximation. The
effects of gravity darkening on typical SPB models are next studied. We find
that at the red border of the SPB instability strip, prograde sectoral (PS)
modes are preferentially excited, with periods shifted in the 0.2--0.5~d range
due to the Coriolis effect. These modes are best seen when the star is seen
equator-on. For such inclinations, low-mass SPB models can appear fainter due
to gravity darkening and as if they were located between the $\delta$~Scuti and

simplicity, rapidity, low consumption of chemicals, and portability with high
analytical performance taking into account parameters such as precision,
linearity, robustness, and accuracy. This approach relies on the effect of the
analyte content over the Gibbs free energy of dispersions, affecting the
thermodynamic stabilization of emulsions or Winsor systems to form
microemulsions (MEs). Such phenomenon was expressed by the minimum volume
fraction of amphiphile required to form microemulsion, which was the analytical
signal of the method. The performed studies were: phase behavior, droplet
dimension by dynamic light scattering, analytical curve, and robustness tests.
The reliability of the method was evaluated by determining water in ethanol
fuels and monoethylene glycol in complex samples of liquefied natural gas. The
dispersions were composed of water-chlorobenzene (water analysis) and
water-oleic acid (monoethylene glycol analysis) with ethanol as the hydrotrope
phase. The experiments to determine water demonstrated that the analytical
performance depends on the composition of ME. The linear range was fairly broad
with limits of linearity up to 70.00% water in ethanol. For monoethylene glycol
in water the linear range was observed throughout the volume fraction of
analyte. The natural gas samples provided by the Petrobras exhibited color,
particulate material, high ionic strength, and diverse compounds as metals,
carboxylic acids, and anions. The method allowed accurate measures bypassing
steps such as extraction, preconcentration, and dilution of the sample. In
addition, the levels of robustness were promising. This parameter was evaluated
by investigating the effect of (i) deviations in volumetric preparation of the
dispersions and (ii) changes in temperature over the analyte contents recorded

presenting differences at a concrete or abstract syntactic level. While showing
some success, these approaches are inherently limited to comparing syntactic
structures. This paper is a manifesto for research on semantic model
differencing. We present our vision to develop semantic diff operators for
model comparisons: operators whose input consists of two models and whose
output is a set of diff witnesses, instances of one model that are not
instances of the other. In particular, if the models are syntactically
different but there are no diff witnesses, the models are semantically
equivalent. We demonstrate our vision using two concrete diff operators, for

eighteenth century, many hypercomplex number systems have been proposed but
none of them succeeded in extending the concept of complex numbers to higher
dimensions. This paper provides a definitive solution to this problem by
defining the truly hypercomplex numbers of dimension N greater than or equal to
3. The secret lies in the definition of the multiplicative law and its
properties. This law is based on spherical and hyperspherical coordinates.
These numbers which I call spherical and hyperspherical hypercomplex numbers
define Abelian groups over addition and multiplication. Nevertheless, the
multiplicative law generally does not distribute over addition, thus the set of
these numbers equipped with addition and multiplication does not form a
mathematical field. However, such numbers are expected to have a tremendous
utility in mathematics and in science in general.

can be analyzed in terms of mutual information among geographical, sectorial,

resulting synergy values of a TH system provide static snapshots. In this
study, we add the time dimension and analyze the synergy dynamics using the
Norwegian innovation system as an example. The synergy among the three
dimensions can be mapped as a set of partial time series and spectrally
analyzed. The results suggest that the synergy at the level of both the country
and its 19 counties shoe non-chaotic oscillatory behavior and resonates in a
set of natural frequencies. That is, synergy surges and drops are non-random
and can be analyzed and predicted. There is a proportional dependence between
the amplitudes of oscillations and synergy values and an inverse proportional
dependence between the oscillation frequencies' relative inputs and synergy
values. This analysis of the data informs us that one can expect
frequency-related synergy-volatility growth in relation to the synergy value
and a shift in the synergy volatility towards the long-term fluctuations with
the synergy growth.

  Social Media Data",,,,,"cs.SI physics.soc-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In the past several years, social media (e.g., Twitter and Facebook) has been
experiencing a spectacular rise and popularity, and becoming a ubiquitous
discourse for content sharing and social networking. With the widespread of
mobile devices and location-based services, social media typically allows users
to share whereabouts of daily activities (e.g., check-ins and taking photos),
and thus strengthens the roles of social media as a proxy to understand human
behaviors and complex social dynamics in geographic spaces. Unlike conventional
spatiotemporal data, this new modality of data is dynamic, massive, and
typically represented in stream of unstructured media (e.g., texts and photos),
which pose fundamental representation, modeling and computational challenges to
conventional spatiotemporal analysis and geographic information science. In
this paper, we describe a scalable computational framework to harness massive
location-based social media data for efficient and systematic spatiotemporal
data analysis. Within this framework, the concept of space-time trajectories
(or paths) is applied to represent activity profiles of social media users. A
hierarchical spatiotemporal data model, namely a spatiotemporal data cube
model, is developed based on collections of space-time trajectories to
represent the collective dynamics of social media users across aggregation
boundaries at multiple spatiotemporal scales. The framework is implemented
based upon a public data stream of Twitter feeds posted on the continent of
North America. To demonstrate the advantages and performance of this framework,
an interactive flow mapping interface (including both single-source and
multiple-source flow mapping) is developed to allow real-time, and interactive
visual exploration of movement dynamics in massive location-based social media
at multiple scales.

fuel in inertial confinement fusion pellets at the ion kinetic level. The
analysis is based on a two-velocity-scale Vlasov-Fokker-Planck kinetic model
that is specially tailored to treat fusion products (suprathermal
{\alpha}-particles) in a self-consistent manner with the thermal bulk. The
model assumes spherical symmetry in configuration space and axial symmetry in
velocity space around the mean flow velocity. Compared to fluid simulations
where a multi-group diffusion scheme is applied to model {\alpha} transport,
the full ion-kinetic approach reveals significant non-local effects on the
transport of energetic $\alpha$-particles. This has a direct impact on
hydrodynamic spatial profiles during combustion: the hot spot reactivity is
reduced, while the inner dense fuel layers are preheated by the escaping
{\alpha}-suprathermal particles, which are transported farther out of the hot
spot. We show how the kinetic transport enhancement of fusion products leads to
a significant reduction of the fusion yield.

user is expected to touch the machine interface to give input. Hand gesture is
such a way to interact with machines where natural bare hand is used to
communicate without touching machine interface. It gives a feeling to user that
he is interacting in natural way to some human, not with traditional machines.
This paper presents a technique where user needs not to touch the machine
interface to draw on screen. Here hand finger draws shapes on monitor like
stylus, without touching the monitor. This method can be used in many
applications including games. The finger was used as an input device that acts
like paint-brush or finger-stylus and is used to make shapes in front of the
camera. Fingertip extraction and motion tracking were done in Matlab with real
time constraints. This work is an early attempt to replace stylus with the
natural finger without touching screen.

values of $r_{\mathrm{\scriptsize{ex}}}$ and $L$ were found for a Halbach
cylinder with the least possible volume of magnets with a given mean flux
density in the cylinder bore. The volume of the cylinder bore could also be
significantly increase by only slightly increasing the volume of the magnets,
for a fixed mean flux density. Placing additional blocks of magnets on the end
faces of the Halbach cylinder also improved the mean flux density in the
cylinder bore, especially so for short Halbach cylinders with large
$r_{\mathrm{\scriptsize{ex}}}$. Moreover magnetic cooling as an application for
Halbach cylinders was considered. A magnetic cooling quality parameter,
$\Lambda_{\mathrm{cool}}$, was introduced and results showed that this
parameter was optimal for long Halbach cylinders with small
$r_{\mathrm{\scriptsize{ex}}}$. Using the previously mentioned additional
blocks of magnets can improve the parameter by as much as 15% as well as
improve the homogeneity of the field in the cylinder bore.

system (FDDS), implementd on an embedded DSP platform is presented here.
Textural features of fabric image are extracted based on gray level
co-occurrence matrix (GLCM). A sliding window technique is used for defect
detection where window moves over the whole image computing a textural energy
from the GLCM of the fabric image. The energy values are compared to a
reference and the deviations beyond a threshold are reported as defects and
also visually represented by a window. The implementation is carried out on a
TI TMS320DM642 platform and programmed using code composer studio software. The
real time output of this implementation was shown on a monitor.
