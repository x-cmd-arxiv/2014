UV-Vis absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy studies suggest both the dyes

Acf to RhB in solution and LbL films. The energy transfer efficiency increases
in presence of clay laponite and the maximum efficiency were 78.17% and 32.54%
in clay dispersion and in LbL films respectively. Presence of laponite
particles onto LbL film was confirmed by atomic force microscopy investigations
with a surface coverage of more than 75%. Energy transfer efficiency was pH
sensitive and the energy transfer efficiency varies from 4.5% to 44.45% in
mixed dye solution for a change in pH from 3.0 to 12.0. With proper calibration
it is possible to use the present system under investigation to sense pH over a
wide range of pH from 3.0 to 12.0.

biology as well as becoming increasingly important for microfluidic
applications or targeted drug delivery. Membrane channels in cells are useful
models for artificial designs because of their high efficiency, selectivity and
robustness to external fluctuations. Here we model the passive channels that
let cargo simply diffuse through them, affected by a potential profile along
the way. Passive transporters achieve high levels of efficiency and specificity
from binding interactions with the cargo inside the channel. This however leads
to a paradox: why should channels which are so narrow that they are blocked by
their cargo evolve to have binding regions for their cargo if that will
effectively block them? Using Brownian dynamics simulations, we show that
different potentials, notably symmetric, increase the flux through narrow
passive channels -- and investigate how shape and depth of potentials influence
the flux. We find that there exist optimal depths for certain potential shapes
and that it is most efficient to apply a small force over an extended region of
the channel. On the other hand, having several spatially discrete binding
pockets will not alter the flux significantly. We also explore the role of
many-particle effects arising from pairwise particle interactions with their
neighbours and demonstrate that the relative changes in flux can be accounted
for by the kinetics of the absorption reaction at the end of the channel.

Anisotropy (MCA) of L10 FePt clusters with alternating Fe and Pt planes along

of each cluster by using ab initio spin-polarized density functional theory
(DFT), and the MCA with both spin-polarized DFT (including spin-orbit coupling
self-consistently) and the torque method. We find that the MCA of any composite
structure of a given size is enhanced with respect to that of the same-sized
pure Pt or pure Fe cluster as well as to that of any pair of Fe and Pt atoms in
bulk L10 FePt. This enhancement results from the hybridization we observe
between the 3d orbital of the Fe atoms and the 5d orbital of their Pt
neighbors. This hybridization, however, affects the electronic properties of
the component atoms in significantly different ways. While it somewhat
increases the spin moment of the Fe atoms, it has little effect on their
orbital moment; at the same time, it greatly increases both the spin and
orbital moment of the Pt atoms. Given the fact that the spin-orbit coupling
(SOC) constant of Pt is about 7 times greater than that of Fe, this Fe-induced
jump in the orbital moment of the Pt atoms produces the increase in MCA of the
composite structures over that of their pure counterparts. That any composite
structure exhibits higher MCA than bulk L10 FePt results from the lower
coordination of Pt atoms in the cluster, whether Fe or Pt predominates within
it. We also find that bipyramidal clusters whose central layer is Pt have
higher MCA than their same-sized counterparts whose central layer is Fe. This
results from the fact that Pt atoms in such configurations are coordinated with
more Fe atoms than in the latter. By thus participating in more instances of
hybridization, they contribute higher orbital moments to the overall MCA of the
unit.

special in that it allows simultaneous identification of the endmember spectral

on convex relaxations. In this study, we explore the alternative of greedy
pursuit, which generally provides efficient and simple algorithms. In
particular, we design a greedy SD-MMV algorithm using simultaneous orthogonal
matching pursuit. Intriguingly, the proposed greedy algorithm is shown to be
closely related to some existing pure pixel search algorithms, especially, the
successive projection algorithm (SPA). Thus, a link between SD-MMV and pure
pixel search is revealed. We then perform exact recovery analyses, and prove
that the proposed greedy algorithm is robust to noise---including its
identification of the (unknown) number of endmembers---under a sufficiently low
noise level. The identification performance of the proposed greedy algorithm is
demonstrated through both synthetic and real-data experiments.

literature in mixture models and several empirical examples, there is no
previous work that gives general theoretical justification for including
auxiliary variables in mixture models, even for special cases. We provide a
theoretical basis for comparing inference for mixture multivariate models with
the corresponding inference for marginal univariate mixture models. Analytical
results for several special cases are established. We show that the probability
of correctly allocating mixture memberships and the information number for the
means of the primary outcome in a bivariate model with two Gaussian mixtures
are generally larger than those in each univariate model. Simulations under a

improvement. The method is illustrated by two real applications in ecology and

model simply by specifying the category's attributes. For example, with
classifiers for generic attributes like \emph{striped} and \emph{four-legged},
one can construct a classifier for the zebra category by enumerating which
properties it possesses---even without providing zebra training images. In
practice, however, the standard zero-shot paradigm suffers because attribute
predictions in novel images are hard to get right. We propose a novel random
forest approach to train zero-shot models that explicitly accounts for the
unreliability of attribute predictions. By leveraging statistics about each
attribute's error tendencies, our method obtains more robust discriminative
models for the unseen classes. We further devise extensions to handle the
few-shot scenario and unreliable attribute descriptions. On three datasets, we
demonstrate the benefit for visual category learning with zero or few training
examples, a critical domain for rare categories or categories defined on the

held by Alice, the $B$ system held by Bob, the $C$ system that is to be
transmitted from Alice to Bob, and the $R$ system that holds a purification of
the state in the $ABC$ registers. We give upper and lower bounds on the amount
of quantum communication and entanglement required to perform the task of
quantum state redistribution in a one-shot setting. Our bounds are in terms of
the smooth conditional min- and max-entropy, and the smooth max-information.
The protocol for the upper bound has a clear structure, building on the work
[Oppenheim (2008)]: it decomposes the quantum state redistribution task into
two simpler quantum state merging tasks by introducing a coherent relay. In the
independent and identical (iid) asymptotic limit our bounds for the quantum
communication cost converge to the quantum conditional mutual information
$I(C:R|B)$, and our bounds for the total cost converge to the conditional
entropy $H(C|B)$. This yields an alternative proof of optimality of these rates
for quantum state redistribution in the iid asymptotic limit. In particular, we
obtain a strong converse for quantum state redistribution, which even holds
when allowing for feedback.

use the MESA stellar evolution code to calculate $\dot m_{\rm crit}$ as a

  domain",,,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A proof of the optimality of the eigenfunctions of the Laplace-Beltrami
operator (LBO) in representing smooth functions on surfaces is provided and
adapted to the field of applied shape and data analysis. It is based on the
Courant-Fischer min-max principle adapted to our case. % The theorem we present
supports the new trend in geometry processing of treating geometric structures
by using their projection onto the leading eigenfunctions of the decomposition
of the LBO. Utilisation of this result can be used for constructing numerically
efficient algorithms to process shapes in their spectrum. We review a couple of
applications as possible practical usage cases of the proposed optimality
criteria. % We refer to a scale invariant metric, which is also invariant to
bending of the manifold. This novel pseudo-metric allows constructing an LBO by
which a scale invariant eigenspace on the surface is defined. We demonstrate
the efficiency of an intermediate metric, defined as an interpolation between
the scale invariant and the regular one, in representing geometric structures
while capturing both coarse and fine details. Next, we review a numerical
acceleration technique for classical scaling, a member of a family of
flattening methods known as multidimensional scaling (MDS). There, the
optimality is exploited to efficiently approximate all geodesic distances
between pairs of points on a given surface, and thereby match and compare
between almost isometric surfaces. Finally, we revisit the classical principal
component analysis (PCA) definition by coupling its variational form with a
Dirichlet energy on the data manifold. By pairing the PCA with the LBO we can
handle cases that go beyond the scope defined by the observation set that is
handled by regular PCA.

generalization of the connection coefficients of the classical commutative
subalgebras of the group algebra of the symmetric group closely related to the
theory of Jack symmetric functions. First introduced by Goulden and Jackson
(1996) these numbers indexed by three partitions of a given integer $n$ and the
Jack parameter $\alpha$ are defined as the coefficients in the power sum
expansion of the Cauchy sum for Jack symmetric functions. While very little is
known about them, examples of computations for small values of $n$ tend to show
that the nice properties of the special cases $\alpha =1$ (connection
coefficients of the class algebra) and $\alpha = 2$ (connection coefficients of
the double coset algebra) extend to general $\alpha$. Goulden and Jackson
conjectured that Jack connection coefficients are polynomials in $\beta =
\alpha-1$ with non negative integer coefficients given by some statistics on
matchings on a set of $2n$ elements, the so called Matchings-Jack conjecture.
In this paper we look at the case when two of the integer partitions are equal
to the single part $(n)$ and use a framework by Lasalle (2008) for Jack
symmetric functions to show that the coefficients satisfy a simple recurrence
formula that makes their computation very effective and allow a better
understanding of their properties. In particular we prove the Matchings-Jack
conjecture in this case. Furthermore, we provide a bijective proof of the
recurrence formula for $\alpha \in \{1,2\}$ using the combinatorial
interpretation of the coefficients for these specific values of the Jack
parameter. Finally we exhibit the polynomial properties of more general
coefficients where the two single part partitions are replaced by an arbitrary
number of integer partitions either equal to $(n)$ or $[1^{n-2}2]$.

objects. The formation of those objects is puzzling, because the progenitor
star has to lose almost its entire hydrogen envelope in the red-giant phase.
Binary interactions have been invoked, but single sdBs exist as well. We report
the discovery of two close hot subdwarf binaries with small radial velocity
amplitudes. Follow-up photometry revealed reflection effects originating from
cool irradiated companions, but no eclipses. The lower mass limits for the
companions of CPD-64$^{\circ}$481 ($0.048\,M_{\rm \odot}$) and PHL\,457
($0.027\,M_{\rm \odot}$) are significantly below the stellar mass limit. Hence
they could be brown dwarfs unless the inclination is unfavourable. Two very
similar systems have already been reported. The probability that none of them
is a brown dwarf is very small, 0.02%. Hence we provide further evidence that
substellar companions with masses that low are able to eject a common envelope
and form an sdB star. Furthermore, we find that the properties of the observed
sample of hot subdwarfs in reflection effect binaries is consistent with a
scenario where single sdBs can still be formed via common envelope events, but
their low-mass substellar companions do not survive.

simply transfer charge to the bands of a host semiconductor or semimetal, but
rearranges the core energy levels deep in the valence band of the host. This,
in turn, leads to a redistribution of all electrons in the host, and, if
designed properly, changes the location of the Fermi level EF and the density
of conducting charge carriers near EF. The principle is proven experimentally
in elemental Bi, whereby group III elements In and Ga dope Bi p-type, in spite
of the fact that all three atoms are trivalent in the solid state. Electronic
structure calculations show the formation of a hyperdeep defect state (HDS) and
its effect on the EF in Bi doped with In (Bi:In) and Ga (Bi:Ga). The HDS at -5
to -6 eV below the EF of elemental Bi hybridizes with the Bi 6p electrons, and
deprives the Bi valence band of two electrons per impurity atom. This then
perturbs the electron count in the solid and lowers the EF. The charge on the
impurity atoms is unchanged. In principle, this doping action does not result
in the appearance of ionized impurities that scatter conduction electrons and
holes in conventional doping. Experimentally, Shubnikov - de Haas and Hall
Effect measurements show that adding In to Bi results in an increase in the
density of holes. Thermoelectric, galvanomagnetic and thermomagnetic data are
given for single-crystal and polycrystalline samples. In-doping leads to an
enhancement of the thermoelectric figure of merit, which suggests that the new
doping mechanism also gives a route to develop better thermoelectric materials.
The same mechanism is at work for Sn-doped Bi (Bi:Sn), although here ionized
impurity scattering is not avoided.

process (MJP) representations of stochastic kinetic models. Since transition
probabilities are intractable for most processes of interest yet forward
simulation is straightforward, Bayesian inference typically proceeds through
computationally intensive methods such as (particle) MCMC. Such methods
ostensibly require the ability to simulate trajectories from the conditioned
jump process. When observations are highly informative, use of the forward
simulator is likely to be inefficient and may even preclude an exact
(simulation based) analysis. We therefore propose three methods for improving
the efficiency of simulating conditioned jump processes. A conditioned hazard
is derived based on an approximation to the jump process, and used to generate
end-point conditioned trajectories for use inside an importance sampling
algorithm. We also adapt a recently proposed sequential Monte Carlo scheme to
our problem. Essentially, trajectories are reweighted at a set of intermediate
time points, with more weight assigned to trajectories that are consistent with
the next observation. We consider two implementations of this approach, based
on two continuous approximations of the MJP. We compare these constructs for a
simple tractable jump process before using them to perform inference for a
Lotka-Volterra system. The best performing construct is used to infer the
parameters governing a simple model of motility regulation in Bacillus
subtilis.

study in oilfield development. Although the two problems differ in several
respects, both are important considerations in optimizing total oilfield
production, and so recent work in the field has considered the problem of
addressing both problems jointly. Two general approaches to addressing the
joint problem are a simultaneous approach, where all parameters are optimized
at the same time, or a sequential approach, where a distinction between
placement and control parameters is maintained by separating the optimization
problem into two (or more) stages, some of which consider only a subset of the
total number of variables. This latter approach divides the problem into
smaller ones which are easier to solve, but may not explore search space as
fully as a simultaneous approach.
  In this paper we combine a stochastic global algorithm (Particle Swarm
Optimization) and a local search (Mesh Adaptive Direct Search) to compare
several simultaneous and sequential approaches to the joint placement and
control problem. In particular, we study how increasing the complexity of well
models (requiring more variables to describe the well's location and path)
affects the respective performances of the two approaches. The results of
several experiments with synthetic reservoir models suggest that the sequential
approaches are better able to deal with increasingly complex well

stars in the cluster Trumpler 14 (Tr14) in the Carina Nebula. Using optical
multi-band photometry we were able to identify 356 PMS stars showing H-alpha
excess emission with equivalent width EW(H-alpha)>20\AA. We interpret this
observational feature as indication that these objects are still actively
accreting gas from their circumstellar medium. From a comparison of the HR
diagram with PMS evolutionary models we derive ages and masses of the PMS
stars. We find that most of the PMS objects are younger than 10 Myr with a
median age of ~3 Myr. Surprisingly, we also find that ~20% of the mass
accreting objects are older than 10 Myr. For each PMS star in Trumpler 14 we
determine the mass accretion rate ($\dot{M}_{acc}$) and discuss its dependence
on mass and age. We finally combine the optical photometry with near-IR
observations to build the spectral energy distribution (SED) for each PMS star
in Tr14. The analysis of the SEDs suggests the presence of transitional discs
in which a large amount of gas is still present and sustains accretion onto the
PMS object at ages older than 10 Myr. Our results, discussed in light of recent
recent discoveries with Herschel of transitional discs containing a massive gas
component around the relatively old PSM stars TW Hydrae, 49 Ceti, and HD 95086,

MILES, and the synthetic library by Coelho et al. (2005). Validation of the
method is achieved through recovery of the known atmospheric parameters for 49
well-studied stars that cover a wide range in the parameter space. We adopted

giant stars observed with resolution R ~ 2,000, yielding results compatible
with high-resolution spectroscopy. The derived alpha-element abundances show
[A/Fe] vs. [Fe/H] consistent with that of field stars at the same

families of polytopes with interesting symmetries are regular polygons in the
plane, which have played an important role in the study of linear programming
lifts (or extended formulations). In this paper we study equivariant psd lifts
of regular polygons. We first show that the standard Lasserre/sum-of-squares
hierarchy for the regular N-gon requires exactly ceil(N/4) iterations and thus
yields an equivariant psd lift of size linear in N. In contrast we show that
one can construct an equivariant psd lift of the regular 2^n-gon of size 2n-1,
which is exponentially smaller than the psd lift of the sum-of-squares
hierarchy. Our construction relies on finding a sparse sum-of-squares
certificate for the facet-defining inequalities of the regular 2^n-gon, i.e.,
one that only uses a small (logarithmic) number of monomials. Since any
equivariant LP lift of the regular 2^n-gon must have size 2^n, this gives the
first example of a polytope with an exponential gap between sizes of
equivariant LP lifts and equivariant psd lifts. Finally we prove that our
construction is essentially optimal by showing that any equivariant psd lift of
the regular N-gon must have size at least logarithmic in N.

Afterwards, we discuss urban traffic optimization, presenting the most recent
works on traffic signal control and vehicle routing control. Then, after
recalling the main concepts of Vehicular Ad-Hoc Networks (VANETs), we classify
the different VANET-based approaches to UTM, according to three categories

optical/ultraviolet photons inside the broad line region (BLR), necessarily
implying a huge optical depth for $\gamma$ rays above 20 GeV. As a consequence,
photons with energy above such a threshold should not be emitted. However,
photons in the energy range 70 - 400 GeV have been observed by MAGIC from the
FSRQ PKS 1222+216. Several astrophysical explanations exist in the literature,
but they are all ad hoc, namely devised only for that specific purpose. We show
that such a surprising discovery can be explained within standard blazar models
by adding the new possibility that photons oscillate into axion-like particles
(ALPs) and vice-versa inside the source. Through the photon-ALP oscillation
mechanism a sizable fraction of very-high energy (VHE) photons can escape
absorption from the BLR in a similar fashion as they largely avoid absorption
from the extragalactic background light (EBL) in the intergalactic space.
Actually, we show that not only are VHE photon indeed emitted, but also that
their spectral energy distribution (SED) is such that they lie on the same
Compton peak to which also lower energy photons simultaneously detected by
Fermi/LAT belong.

dust-scattered stellar light around these stars using the PolCor instrument
mounted on the ESO 3.6m telescope. Observations were done with a coronographic
mask to block out the direct stellar light. The polarised images clearly show
the detached shells. Using a dust radiative transfer code to model the
dust-scattered polarised light, we constrain the radii and widths of the shells
to 19.5 arcsec and 9.4 arcsec for the detached dust shells around R Scl and
V644 Sco, respectively. Both shells have an overall spherical symmetry and
widths of approx. 2 arcsec. For R Scl we can compare the observed dust emission
directly with high spatial-resolution maps of CO(3-2) emission from the shell
observed with ALMA. We find that the dust and gas coincide almost exactly,
indicating a common evolution. The data presented here for R Scl are the most
detailed observations of the entire dusty detached shell to date. For V644 Sco
these are the first direct measurements of the detached shell. Also here we
find that the dust most likely coincides with the gas shell. The observations
are consistent with a scenario where the detached shells are created during a

rotation in the UCD regime suggest that it cannot be responsible for the two
signals. The system's radio emission consists of at least three components:
rapid 100% polarized flares, bright emission modulating periodically in phase
with the optical emission, and an additional periodic component that appears
only in the 2013 observational campaign. We interpret the last of these as a
gyrosynchrotron feature associated with large-scale magnetic fields and a cool,
equatorial plasma torus. However, the persistent rapid flares at all rotational
phases imply that small-scale magnetic loops are also present and reconnect
nearly continuously. We present an SED of the blended system spanning more than

this debris. The YORP effect, which arises from radiation pressure, accelerates
the spin rate of asymmetric asteroids, which can eventually shear themselves
apart. This pressure is maintained and enhanced around dying stars because the
outward push of an asteroid due to stellar mass loss is insignificant compared
to the resulting stellar luminosity increase. Consequently, giant star
radiation will destroy nearly all bodies with radii in the range 100 m - 10 km
that survive their parent star's main sequence lifetime within a distance of
about 7 au; smaller bodies are spun apart to their strongest, competent
components. This estimate is conservative, and would increase for highly
asymmetric shapes or incorporation of the inward drag due to giant star stellar
wind. The resulting debris field, which could extend to thousands of au, may be
perturbed by remnant planetary systems to reproduce the observed dusty and

to low-J CO transitions and that XDRs are required. By adopting a composite
PDR+XDR model we derive molecular cloud and radiation field properties in the
nuclear region of J1148. Our results show that highly excited CO lines
represent a sensitive and possibly unique tool to infer the presence of X-ray
faint or obscured supermassive black hole progenitors in high-z galaxies.

core-collapse of Wolf-Rayet stars. Whereas their stellar masses $M_*$ have a
rather narrow distribution, the population of GRBs is very diverse, with
gamma-ray luminosities $L_\gamma$ spanning several orders of magnitude. This
suggests the existence of a ""hidden"" stellar variable whose burst-to-burst
variation leads to a spread in $L_\gamma$. Whatever this hidden variable is,
its variation should not noticeably affect the shape of GRB lightcurves, which
display a constant luminosity (in a time-average sense) followed by a sharp
drop at the end of the burst seen with Swift/XRT. We argue that such a hidden
variable is progenitor star's large-scale magnetic flux. Shortly after the core
collapse, most of stellar magnetic flux accumulates near the black hole (BH)
and remains there. The flux extracts BH rotational energy and powers jets of
roughly a constant luminosity, $L_j$. However, once BH mass accretion rate
$\dot M$ falls below $\sim L_j/c^2$, the flux becomes dynamically important and
diffuses outwards, with the jet luminosity set by the rapidly declining mass
accretion rate, $L_j\sim \dot M c^2$. This provides a potential explanation for
the sharp end of GRBs and the universal shape of their lightcurves. During the
GRB, gas infall translates spatial variation of stellar magnetic flux into
temporal variation of $L_j$. We make use of the deviations from constancy in
$L_j$ to perform stellar magnetic flux ""tomography"". Using this method, we
infer the presence of magnetised tori in the outer layers of progenitor stars
for GRB 920513 and GRB 940210.

The theory is interacting with a single coupling constant g and is based on a

(super)algebra representation as well as matrix indices for the adjoint
representation of U(N). We show that SMT describes N=4 super-Yang-Mills theory
(SYM) near zero-temperature critical points in the grand canonical phase
diagram. Equivalently, SMT arises from non-relativistic limits of N=4 SYM. Even
though SMT is a non-relativistic quantum mechanical theory it contains a
variety of phases mimicking the AdS/CFT correspondence. Moreover, the infinite
g limit of SMT can be mapped to the supersymmetric sector of string theory on
AdS_5 x S^5. We study SU(2) SMT in detail. At large N and low temperatures it
is a theory of spin chains that for small g resembles planar gauge theory and
for large g a non-relativistic string theory. When raising the temperature a
partial deconfinement transition occurs due to finite-N effects. For
sufficiently high temperatures the partially deconfined phase has a classical
regime. We find a matrix model description of this regime at any coupling g.
Setting g=0 it is a theory of N^2+1 harmonic oscillators while for large g it
becomes 2N harmonic oscillators.

the presence of a major quasar-driven outflow indicated by previous

projected radius of ~30 kpc. The extreme spatial extent of the outflow allows
us, for the first time in an external galaxy, to estimate mass-loss rate,
kinetic power and momentum rate of the outflow as a function of the projected
distance from the nucleus and the dynamical time-scale. These trends reveal
multiple outflow events during the past 100 Myr, although the bulk of the mass,
energy and momentum appear to have been released more recently, within the past
~20 Myr. Surprisingly, we discover that also the quiescent gas at systemic
velocity is extremely extended. More specifically, we find that, while 30% of
the [CII] within v\in(-200, 200) km/s traces a compact component that is not
resolved by our observations, 70% of the [CII] emission in this velocity range
is extended, with a projected FWHM size of 17.4+-1.4 kpc. We detect FIR
continuum emission associated with both the compact and the extended [CII]

smaller than the extended [CII] source. Overall, our results indicate that the

significant energy kick from the merger between their own host halo and a
target halo. This is highly relevant for understanding the growth of
cosmological halos, and could especially provide an explanation for some high
velocity objects. The model we present includes a \emph{double scattering
mechanism}, where a halo particle is given a significant energy kick by
undergoing two subsequent gravitational deflections during the merger. The
first deflection is by the potential of the target halo, whereas the second is
by the potential of the particle's original host halo. The resultant energy
kick arises because the two halos move relative to each other during the two
deflections. To our knowledge, this mechanism has never been characterized in
this context before. We derive analytically a halo particle's total kick
energy, which is composed of energy from the double scattering mechanism and
energy release from tidal fields, as a function of its position in its original
host halo. In the case of a $1:10$ merger between two Hernquist halos, we
estimate that the presented mechanisms can generate particles with a velocity
$\sim 2$ times the virial velocity of the target halo measured at its virial
sphere. This motivates us to suggest that the high velocity of the recently
discovered globular cluster HVCG-1 \citep{2014ApJ...787L..11C} can be explained
by a head-on halo merger. Finally, we illustrate the orbital evolution of
particles outside the virial sphere of the target halo, by solving the equation
of motion in an expanding universe. We find a 'sweet spot' around a scale
factor of $0.3-0.5$ for ejecting particles into large orbits, which easily can
reach beyond $\sim 5$ virial radii.

describe here a new method using time-delay lensed quasars where one or several
images are affected by microlensing due to stars in the lensing galaxy. Because
microlensing decreases (or increases) the flux of the continuum compared to the
broad line region, it changes the contrast between these two emission
components. We show that this effect can be used to effectively disentangle the
intrinsic variability of those two regions, offering the opportunity to perform
reverberation mapping based on single band photometric data. Based on simulated
light curves generated using a damped random walk model of quasar variability,
we show that measurement of the size of the broad line region can be achieved
using this method, provided one spectrum has been obtained independently during
the monitoring. This method is complementary to photometric reverberation
mapping and could also be extended to multi-band data. Because the effect
described above produces a variability pattern in difference light curves
between pairs of lensed images which is correlated with the time-lagged
continuum variability, it can potentially produce systematic errors in
measurement of time delays between pairs of lensed images. Simple simulations
indicate that time-delay measurement techniques which use a sufficiently
flexible model for the extrinsic variability are not affected by this effect
and produce accurate time delays.

of the black hole remnant influences mass ejection on the thermal and viscous
timescales. We carry out two-dimensional, time-dependent hydrodynamic
simulations of merger remnant accretion disks including viscous angular
momentum transport and approximate neutrino self-irradiation. The gravity of
the spinning black hole is included via a pseudo-Newtonian potential. We find
that a disk around a spinning black hole ejects more mass, up to a factor of
several, relative to the non-spinning case. The enhanced mass loss is due to
energy release by accretion occurring deeper in the gravitational potential,
raising the disk temperature and hence the rate of viscous heating in regions
where neutrino cooling is ineffective. The mean electron fraction of the
outflow increases moderately with BH spin due to a highly-irradiated (though
not neutrino-driven) wind component. While the bulk of the ejecta is still very
neutron-rich, thus generating heavy r-process elements, the leading edge of the
wind contains a small amount of Lanthanide-free material. This component can
give rise to a ~1 day blue optical `bump' in a kilonova light curve, even in
the case of prompt BH formation, which may facilitate its detection.

systems; e.g., superconductors and Kondo-correlated quantum dots. Here, we
report on an unexpected, but robust, electron ""pairing"" in the integer quantum
Hall effect (IQHE) regime. The pairing takes place within an interfering edge
channel circulating in an electronic Fabry-Perot interferometer at a wide range
of bulk filling factors, $2<{\nu} _B<5$. The main observations are: (a) High
visibility Aharonov-Bohm conductance oscillations with magnetic flux
periodicity ${\Delta}{\phi}={\varphi}_0/2=h/2e$ (instead of the ubiquitous
$h/e$), with $e$ the electron charge and $h$ the Planck constant; (b) An
interfering quasiparticle charge $e ^* {\sim} 2e$ - revealed by quantum shot
noise measurements; and (c) Full dephasing of the $h/2e$ periodicity by induced
dephasing of the adjacent edge channel (while keeping the interfering edge
channel intact) : a clear realization of inter-channel entanglement. While this
pairing phenomenon clearly results from inter-channel interaction, the exact
mechanism that leads to e-e attraction within a single edge channel is not
clear.

(0.02<z<0.09) Seyfert-1 galaxies, selected from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey
(SDSS). Analysis of SDSS images yields AGN luminosities free of host-galaxy
contamination and morphological classification. 51/66 galaxies have spiral
morphology. 28 bulges have Sersic index n<2 and are considered candidate pseudo
bulges, with eight being definite pseudo bulges based on multiple
classification criteria met. Only 4/66 galaxies show sign of
interaction/merging. High signal-to-noise ratio Keck spectra provide the width
of the broad Hbeta emission line free of FeII emission and stellar absorption.
AGN luminosity and Hbeta line widths are used to estimate MBH. The Keck-based
spatially-resolved kinematics is used to determine stellar-velocity dispersion
within the spheroid effective radius. We find that sigma can vary on average by
up to 40% across definitions commonly used in the literature, emphasizing the
importance of using self-consistent definitions in comparisons and evolutionary
studies. The MBH-sigma relation for our Seyfert-1 galaxies has the same
intercept and scatter as that of reverberation-mapped AGNs as well as quiescent
galaxies, consistent with the hypothesis that our single epoch MBH estimator
and sample selection do not introduce significant biases. Barred galaxies,
merging galaxies, and those hosting pseudo bulges do not represent outliers in
the MBH-sigma relation. This is in contrast with previous work, although no
firm conclusion can be drawn due to the small sample size and limited
resolution of the SDSS images.

from redshifts 0.1 to 1.2 and calculate accurate K-corrections to determine
uniform magnitudes in two synthetic rest-frame filters with central wavelengths

investigate the correlation between their decline rates and peak magnitude and
find that the brighter events appear to decline more slowly. We define a
$\Delta M(30)$ decay relation. This correlates peak magnitude and decline over
30 days and can reduce the scatter to 0.25. We further show that M(400) appears
to have a strong colour dependence. Using this colour rate decay relation, a
low scatter of between 0.19 and 0.26 can be found depending on sample
selection. However we caution that only eight to ten objects currently have
enough data to test this colour rate decline relation. We conclude that SLSN Ic
are promising distance indicators at high redshift in regimes beyond those
possible with SNe Ia. Although the empirical relationships are encouraging, the
unknown progenitor systems and how they may evolve with redshift are of some
concern. The two major measurement uncertainties are the limited numbers of low
redshift objects to test these relationships and internal dust extinction in
the host galaxies.

recent years, aerodynamic-aided accretion of ""pebbles,"" objects ranging from
centimeters to meters in size, has been suggested as a potential solution to
this long-standing problem. While pebble accretion has been demonstrated to be
extremely effective in local simulations that look at the detailed behavior of
these pebbles in the vicinity of a single planetary embryo, to date there have
been no global simulations demonstrating the effectiveness of pebble accretion
in a more complicated, multi-planet environment. Therefore, we have
incorporated the aerodynamic-aided accretion physics into LIPAD, a Lagrangian
code that can follow the collisional / accretional / dynamical evolution of a
protoplanetary system, to investigate how pebble accretion manifests itself in
the larger planet formation picture. We find that under generic circumstances,
pebble accretion naturally leads to an ""oligarchic"" type of growth in which a
large number of planetesimals grow to similar-sized planets. In particular, our
simulations tend to form hundreds of Mars- and Earth-mass objects between 4 and
10 AU. While the merging of some oligarchs may allow them to grow massive
enough to form giant planet cores, leftover oligarchs lead to planetary systems
that cannot be consistent with our own solar system. We investigate various
ideas presented in the literature (including evaporation fronts and planet
traps) and find that none easily overcome this tendency toward oligarchic
growth.

are absent in nonprecessing systems. The most prominent of these is a
parity-violating asymmetry that beams energy and linear momentum preferentially
along or opposite to the orbital angular momentum, leading to recoil of the
binary. The asymmetry will appear as amplitude and phase modulations at the
orbital frequency. For strongly precessing systems, it accounts for at least 3%
amplitude modulation for binaries in the sensitivity band of ground-based
gravitational-wave detectors, and can exceed 50% for massive systems. Such
asymmetric features are also clearly visible when the waves are decomposed into
modes of spin-weighted spherical harmonics, and are inherent in the waves
themselves---rather than resulting from residual eccentricity in numerical
simulations, or from mode-mixing due to precession. In particular, there is
generically no instantaneous frame for which the mode decomposition will have
any symmetry. We introduce a method to simplify the expressions for waveforms
given in analytical relativity, which can be used to combine existing
high-order waveforms for nonprecessing systems with expressions for the
precessing contributions, leading to improved accuracy and a unified treatment
of precessing and nonprecessing binaries. Using this method, it is possible to
clarify the nature and the origins of the asymmetries and show the effects of
asymmetry on recoils more clearly. We present post-Newtonian (PN) expressions
for the waveform modes that include these terms, complete to the relative 2PN
level in spin (proportional to $v^4/c^4$ times a certain combination of the
spins). Comparing the results of those expressions to numerical results, we
find good qualitative agreement. We also demonstrate how these expressions can
be used to efficiently calculate waveforms for gravitational-wave astronomy.

confirm that the galaxy's recent star formation rate is $<10^{-3}

estimates of the acceptable model parameters for its youngest stellar

$t_sb$ = 0.7-3.4 Gyr ago with a stellar metallicity of -1.7 < [Fe/H] < +0.2; we
also estimate the stellar mass of J1229+02 to be 7.3 < log($M_*/M_{\odot}$) <
7.8. Our previous study of J1229+02 found that a supernova-driven wind was
capable of expelling all of the gas from the galaxy (none is observed today)
and could by itself plausibly create the nearby absorber. But, using new data,
we find a significantly higher galaxy/absorber velocity difference, a younger
starburst age, and a smaller starburst mass than previously reported. Simple
energy-conserving wind models for J1229+02 using fiducial values of $f_m$ ~
0.1, $t_sb$ ~ 2 Gyr, and log(M$_*/M_{\odot}$) ~ 7.5 allow us to conclude that
the galaxy alone cannot produce the observed QSO absorber; i.e., any putative
ejecta must interact with ambient gas from outside J1229+02. Because J1229+02
is located in the southern extension of the Virgo cluster ample potential
sources of this ambient gas exist. Based on the two nearest examples of strong
metal-line absorbers discovered serendipitously (the current one and the 1700
km/s metal-line absorber in the nearby Q1230+0115 sight line), we conclude that
absorbers with $10^{14} < N_{HI} < 10^{16}$ cm$^{-2}$ at impact parameters
>1$R_{vir}$ are likely intergalactic systems and cannot be identified
unambiguously as the circumgalactic material of any one individual galaxy.

parameter for monitoring common home appliances. However, key questions

  In this paper we introduce a notion of regular point for a polynomial

Can we measure the relationship between demand and supply for new information

bursts statistics across topics that have an heterogeneous distribution of
attention. Through analysis of a massive dataset on traffic to Wikipedia, we
find that the production of new knowledge is associated to significant shifts

observe is consistent with a scenario in which the allocation of attention
toward a topic stimulates the demand for information about it, and in turn the
supply of further novel information. Our attempt to quantify demand and supply

development of the fundamental laws of the attention economy, and a better

establish the energy loss picture, is high pT direct photon production for
which no suppression is expected. For low pT photon production, it is expected

observe potentially H2O-rich super-Earths that provide the best prospects for
characterizing their atmospheres using existing instruments. Firstly, we
provide analytic prescriptions and discuss factors that need to be taken into
account while planning and interpreting observations of super-Earth radii and
spectra. We discuss how observations in different spectral bandpasses constrain
different atmospheric properties of a super-Earth, including radius and
temperature of the planetary surface as well as the mean molecular mass, the
chemical composition and thermal profile of the atmosphere. In particular, we
caution that radii measured in certain bandpasses can induce biases in the
interpretation of the interior compositions. Secondly, we investigate the
detectability of H2O-rich super-Earth atmospheres using the HST WFC3
spectrograph as a function of the planetary properties and stellar brightness.
We find that highly irradiated super-Earths orbiting bright stars, such as 55
Cancri e, present better candidates for atmospheric characterization compared
to cooler planets such as GJ 1214b even if the latter orbit lower-mass stars.
Besides being better candidates for both transmission and emission
spectroscopy, hotter planets offer higher likelihood of cloud-free atmospheres
which aid tremendously in the observation and interpretation of spectra.
Finally, we present case studies of two super-Earths, GJ 1214b and 55 Cancri e,
using available data and models of their interiors and atmospheres.

$\mathcal{O}$ defined by the author and collaborators to explicit finitely
presented algebras, and apply this to quiver varieties. This allows us to
describe combinatorially not just the structure of these category
$\mathcal{O}$'s but also how certain interesting families of derived
equivalences, the shuffling and twisting functors, act on them.
  In the case of Nakajima quiver varieties, the algebras that appear are
weighted KLR algebras and their steadied quotients, defined by the author in
earlier work. In particular, these give a geometric construction of canonical
bases for simple representations, tensor products and Fock spaces. If the
$\mathbb{C}^*$-action used to define the category $\mathcal{O}$ is a ""tensor
product action"" in the sense of Nakajima, then we arrive at the unique
categorifications of tensor products; in particular, we obtain a geometric
description of the braid group actions used by the author in defining
categorifications of Reshetikhin-Turaev invariants. Similarly, in affine type
A, an arbitrary action results in the diagrammatic algebra equivalent to blocks
of category $\mathcal{O}$ for cyclotomic Cherednik algebras.
  This approach also allows us to show that these categories are Koszul and
understand their Koszul duals; in particular, we can show that
categorifications of minuscule tensor products in types ADE are Koszul.
  In the affine case, this shows that our category $\mathcal{O}$'s are Koszul
and their Koszul duals are given by category $\mathcal{O}$'s with rank-level
dual dimension data, and that this duality switches shuffling and twisting
functors.

$\mathfrak{sl}_2[t]$ are the exterior powers of the fundamental global Weyl
module and give the filtration multiplicities in the standard and costandard
filtration. An interesting consequence of our result (which is far from obvious
from the abstract definition) is that an indecomposable tilting module admits a
free right action of the ring of symmetric polynomials in finitely many
variables. Moreover, if we go modulo the augmentation ideal in this ring, the
resulting $\mathfrak{sl}_2[t]$-module is isomorphic to the dual of a local Weyl
module.

apply a simple model of these distortions to simulated spectra that
characterize the large UVES and HIRES quasar samples which previously indicated
possible evidence for cosmological variations in the fine-structure constant,
$\alpha$. The spurious deviations in $\alpha$ produced by the model closely
match important aspects of the VLT--UVES quasar results at all redshifts and
partially explain the HIRES results, though not self-consistently at all

the distortions are capable of significantly weakening the evidence for
variations in $\alpha$ from quasar absorption lines.

and dust. In these regions, gas outflows driven by starburst and AGN activity
are believed to play a crucial role in the evolution of these galaxies.
However, to fully understand this process it is essential to resolve the
morphology and kinematics of such outflows. Using near-IR integral-field
spectroscopy obtained with VLT/SINFONI, we detect a kpc-scale structure of
high-velocity molecular hydrogen (H2) gas associated with the deeply buried
secondary nucleus of the IR-luminous merger NGC3256. We show that this
structure is likely the hot component of a molecular outflow, which is detected
also in the cold molecular gas by Sakamoto et al. This outflow, with a
molecular gas mass of M(H2)~2x10^7 Msun, is among the first to be spatially
resolved in both the hot H2 gas with VLT/SINFONI and the cold CO-emitting gas
with ALMA. The hot and cold components share a similar morphology and
kinematics, with a hot-to-cold molecular gas mass ratio of ~6x10^-5. The high
(~100 pc) resolution at which we map the geometry and velocity structure of the
hot outflow reveals a biconical morphology with opening angle ~40 deg and gas
spread across a FWZI~1200 km/s. Because this collimated outflow is oriented
close to the plane of the sky, the molecular gas may reach maximum intrinsic
outflow velocities of ~1800 km/s, with an average mass outflow rate of at least
~20 Msun/yr. By modeling the line-ratios of various near-IR H2 transitions, we
show that the H2 gas in the outflow is heated through shocks or X-rays to a
temperature of ~1900K. The energy needed to drive the outflow is likely
provided by a hidden Compton-thick AGN or by the nuclear starburst. We show
that the global kinematics of the molecular outflow in NGC3256 mimic those of
CO-outflows that have been observed at low spatial resolution in starburst- and
active galaxies.

numerous pairs of matrices over $F_p$, for a sufficiently large prime $p$, that
are candidates for collision-resistant hashing. However, this trick can
""backfire"", and lifting matrix entries to $Z$ may facilitate finding a

galaxies with an intrinsic red peak located far from line centre that reside in

non-equilibrium statistical mechanics. Among these developments, the Jarzynski
equality, being a milestone following the landmark work of Clausius and Kelvin,
stands out. The Jarzynski equality relates the free energy difference between
two equilibrium states and the work done on the system through far from
equilibrium processes. While experimental tests of the equality have been
performed in classical regime, the verification of the quantum Jarzynski
equality has not yet been fully demonstrated due to experimental challenges.
Here, we report an experimental test of the quantum Jarzynski equality with a
single \Yb ion trapped in a harmonic potential. We perform projective
measurements to obtain phonon distributions of the initial thermal state.
Following that we apply the laser induced force on the projected energy
eigenstate, and find transition probabilities to final energy eigenstates after
the work is done. By varying the speed of applying the force from equilibrium
to far-from equilibrium regime, we verified the quantum Jarzynski equality in
an isolated system.

are the source of shock waves that form chondrules. It is considered that this
shock-induced chondrule formation requires the velocity of the planetesimal
relative to the gas disk to be on the order of > 7 km/s at 1 AU. In previous
studies on planetesimal excitation, the effects of Jovian mean-motion resonance
together with the gas drag were investigated, but the velocities obtained were
at most 8 km/s in the asteroid belt, which is insufficient to account for the
ubiquitous existence of chondrules. In this paper, we reexamine the effect of
Jovian resonances and take into account the secular resonance in the asteroid
belt caused by the gravity of the gas disk. We find that the velocities
relative to the gas disk of planetesimals a few hundred kilometers in size
exceed 12 km/s, and that this is achieved around the 3:1 mean-motion resonance.
The heating region is restricted to a relatively narrow band between 1.5 AU and
3.5 AU. Our results suggest that chondrules were produced effectively in the
asteroid region after Jovian formation. We also find that many planetesimals
are scattered far beyond Neptune. Our findings can explain the presence of
crystalline silicate in comets if the scattered planetesimals include silicate
dust processed by shock heating.

in terms of a magnetospheric model containing both a helically twisted flux
rope and a current sheet (CS). With the appearance of CS, we solve a mixed
boundary value problem to get the magnetospheric field based on a domain
decomposition method. We investigate properties of the equilibrium curve of the
flux rope when the CS is present in background multipolar fields. In response
to the variations at the magnetar surface, it quasi-statically evolves in
stable equilibrium states. The loss of equilibrium occurs at a critical point
and, beyond that point, it erupts catastrophically. New features show up when
the CS is considered. Especially, we find two kinds of physical behaviors,
i.e., catastrophic state transition and catastrophic escape. Magnetic energy
would be released during state transitions. The released magnetic energy is
sufficient to drive giant flares. The flux rope would go away from the magnetar
quasi-statically, which is inconsistent with the radio afterglow. Fortunately,
in the latter case, i.e., the catastrophic escape, the flux rope could escape
the magnetar and go to infinity in a dynamical way. This is more consistent
with radio afterglow observations of giant flares. We find that the minor
radius of flux rope has important implications for its eruption. Flux ropes
with larger minor radius are more prone to erupt. We stress that the CS
provides an ideal place for magnetic reconnection, which would further enhance
the energy release during eruptions.

  Channels","26 pages, 11 pictures, presented in parts at ISIT2013 and ITW 2014",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Traditionally, the capacity region of a coherent fading multiple access
channel (MAC) is analyzed in two popular contexts. In the first, a centralized
system with full channel state information at the transmitters (CSIT) is
assumed, and the communication parameters like transmit power and data-rate are
jointly chosen for every fading vector realization. On the other hand, in
fast-fading links with distributed CSIT, the lack of full CSI is compensated by
performing ergodic averaging over sufficiently many channel realizations.
Notice that the distributed CSI may necessitate decentralized power-control for
optimal data-transfer. Apart from these two models, the case of slow-fading
links and distributed CSIT, though relevant to many systems, has received much
less attention.
  In this paper, a block-fading AWGN MAC with full CSI at the receiver and
distributed CSI at the transmitters is considered. The links undergo
independent fading, but otherwise have arbitrary fading distributions. The
channel statistics and respective long-term average transmit powers are known
to all parties. We first consider the case where each encoder has knowledge
only of its own link quality, and not of others. For this model, we compute the
adaptive capacity region, i.e. the collection of average rate-tuples under
block-wise coding/decoding such that the rate-tuple for every fading
realization is inside the instantaneous MAC capacity region. The key step in
our solution is an optimal rate allocation function for any given set of
distributed power control laws at the transmitters. This also allows us to
characterize the optimal power control for a wide class of fading models.
Further extensions are also proposed to account for more general CSI
availability at the transmitters.

BICEP2 B-modes can be produced by gravity waves in the early universe, but some
question has arisen as to whether these B-modes (for 50 < l < 120) may instead
be produced by foreground polarized dust emission. The dust emission at 150 GHz
observed by BICEP2 should be less in magnitude but have similar structure to
that at 353 GHz. We have therefore calculated and mapped the B-modes in the
BICEP2 region from the publicly available Q and U 353 GHz preliminary Planck
polarization maps. These have a genus curve that is different from that seen in
the BICEP2 observations, with features at different locations from those in the
BICEP2 map. The two maps show a positive correlation coefficient of 15.2% +/-
3.9% (1-sigma). This requires the amplitude of the Planck (50 < l <120) dust
modes to be low in the BICEP2 region, and the majority of the Planck 353 GHz
signal in the BICEP2 region in these modes to be noise. We can explain the
observed correlation coefficient of 15.2% with a BICEP2 gravity wave signal
with an rms amplitude equal to 54% of the total BICEP2 rms amplitude. The
gravity wave signal corresponds to a tensor-to-scalar ratio r = 0.11 +/- 0.04
(1-sigma). This is consistent with a gravity wave signal having been detected,
at a 2.5-sigma level. The Planck and BICEP2 teams have recently engaged in
joint analysis of their combined data|it will be interesting to see if that

through cation-{\pi} interactions on one side while at the same time bonding to
water molecules through hydration interaction on the other side at a molecular

chemical non-equilibrium that continues to the present day. The work naturally
separates into two parts. The first focuses on aspects of the relic neutrinos

  Part one begins with an overview of the history of the Universe, from just
prior to neutrino freeze-out up through the present day, placing the history of
cosmic neutrino evolution in its proper context. Motivated by the Planck CMB
measurements of the effective number of neutrinos, we derive those properties
of neutrino freeze-out that depend only on conservation laws and are
independent of the details of the scattering processes. Part one ends with a
characterization of the present day neutrino spectrum as seen from Earth.
  The second part of this dissertation focuses on the properties of cosmic
neutrinos that depend on the details of the neutrino reactions, as is necessary
for modeling the non-thermal distortions from equilibrium and computing
freeze-out temperatures. We detail a new spectral method for solving the

well as an improved procedure for analytically simplifying the corresponding
scattering integrals for subsequent numerical computation. We apply these novel

efficiency, we propose to target each crossed trap site with a narrow auxiliary
laser beam, creating an escape channel for energetic atoms. We experimentally
demonstrate runaway evaporation using this scheme, which is characterized by
very modest weakening in atomic confinement such that high densities and
elastic collision rates can be maintained. Based on discretely time-shared
optical tweezers, our approach is particularly suited for addressing the
problem of simultaneously cooling atoms in multiple traps clouds, providing the
freedom to act locally and in a tailored fashion at individual trap sites.

rely heavily on audit to detect and punish insiders who inappropriately access

strategic interaction between an auditor with a single audit resource and
auditees as a Stackelberg game, augmenting associated well-studied security
games with a configurable punishment parameter. We significantly generalize
this audit game model to account for multiple audit resources where each
resource is restricted to audit a subset of all potential violations, thus
enabling application to practical auditing scenarios. We provide an FPTAS that
computes an approximately optimal solution to the resulting non-convex
optimization problem. The main technical novelty is in the design and
correctness proof of an optimization transformation that enables the
construction of this FPTAS. In addition, we experimentally demonstrate that
this transformation significantly speeds up computation of solutions for a
class of audit games and security games.

temperature and the pump fluence dependence of the observed carrier dynamics
are consistent with defect-assisted recombination as being the dominant
mechanism for electron-hole recombination in which the electrons and holes are
captured by defects via Auger processes. Strong Coulomb interactions in two

correlations in two dimensional metal dichalcogenides, make Auger processes
particularly effective for carrier capture by defects. We present a model for
carrier recombination dynamics that quantitatively explains all features of our

approaches have become the de facto standard for the calculation of optical
properties of small and medium-sized molecules. At the heart of these methods
is the solution of an eigenvalue equation in the space of single-orbital
transitions, whose quickly increasing number makes such calculations costly if
not infeasible for larger molecules. This is especially true for time-dependent
density functional tight binding (TD-DFTB), where the evaluation of the matrix
elements is inexpensive. For the relatively large systems that can be studied
the solution of the eigenvalue equation therefore determines the cost of the
calculation. We propose to do an oscillator strength based truncation of the
single-orbital transition space to reduce the computational effort of TD-DFTB
based absorption spectra calculations. We show that even a sizeable truncation
does not destroy the principal features of the absorption spectrum, while
naturally avoiding the unnecessary calculation of excitations with small
oscillator strengths. We argue that the reduced computational cost of
intensity-selected TD-DFTB together with its ease of use compared to other
methods lowers the barrier of performing optical properties calculations of
large molecules, and can serve to make such calculations possible in a wider
array of applications.

be independent of the amount of dephasing introduced, even in the limit of no
dephasing where the transient population dynamics exhibit strong coherent
oscillations. This can be seen to arise from the existence of a rate-limiting

compact convex sets of matrices. When the system is irreducible and the largest
Lyapunov exponent is equal to zero, there always exists a Barabanov norm (i.e.
a norm which is non increasing along trajectories of the linear switched system
together with extremal trajectories starting at every point, that is
trajectories of the linear switched system with constant norm). This paper
deals with two sets of issues: (a) properties of Barabanov norms such as
uniqueness up to homogeneity and strict convexity; (b) asymptotic behaviour of
the extremal solutions of the linear switched system. Regarding Issue (a), we
provide partial answers and propose four open problems motivated by appropriate
examples. As for Issue (b), we establish, when n = 3, a Poincar\'e-Bendixson
theorem under a regularity assumption on the set of matrices defining the
system. Moreover, we revisit the noteworthy result of N.E. Barabanov [5]
dealing with the linear switched system on R^3 associated with a pair of
Hurwitz matrices {A, A + bcT }. We first point out a fatal gap in Barabanov's
argument in connection with geometric features associated with a Barabanov
norm. We then provide partial answers relative to the asymptotic behavior of
this linear switched system.

Furthermore, we demonstrate the importance of dispersion interactions and test
two different ways of incorporating them into the DFT framework. As a result,
we propose two computational schemes which describe accurately the narrow- and

Oscillations in the 3 min band dominate in the umbra. The integrated spectrum
of umbral oscillations contains distinct narrowband peaks at 1.9 min, 2.3 min,
and 2.8 min. The power significantly varies in time, forming distinct
oscillation trains. The oscillation power distribution over the sunspot in the
horizontal plane reveals that the enhancements of the oscillation amplitude, or
wave fronts, have a distinct structure consisting of an evolving two-armed
spiral and a stationary circular patch at the spiral origin, situated near the
umbra centre. This structure is seen from the temperature minimum to the
corona. In time, the spiral rotates anti-clockwise. The wave front spirality is
most pronounced during the maximum amplitude phases of the oscillations. In the
low-amplitude phases the spiral breaks into arc-shaped patches. The 2D
cross-correlation function shows that the oscillations at higher atmospheric
levels occur later than at lower layers. The phase speed is estimated to be
about 100 km/s. The fine spectral analysis shows that the central patch
corresponds to the high-frequency oscillations, while the spiral arms highlight
the lower-frequency oscillations in the 3-min band. The vertical and horizontal
radial structure of the oscillations is consistent with the model that
interprets umbral oscillations as slow magnetoacoustic waves filtered by the
atmospheric temperature non-uniformity in the presence of the magnetic field
inclination from the vertical. The mechanism for the polar-angle structure of
the oscillations, in particular the spirality of the wave fronts, needs to be
revealed.

distribution function of the Kondo temperature ($T_{K}$) shows a power-law tail
in the limit of $T_{K} \rightarrow 0$ regardless of the Kondo coupling
constant. We also find that the distribution function of the ferromagnetic
transition temperature ($T_{c}$) gives a power-law behavior in the limit of
$T_{c} \rightarrow 0$ when an interaction parameter for ferromagnetic
instability lies below a critical value. However, the $T_{c}$ distribution
function stops the power-law increasing behavior in the $T_{c} \rightarrow 0$
limit and vanishes beyond the critical interaction parameter inside the
ferromagnetic phase. These results imply that the typical Kondo temperature
given by a geometric average always vanishes due to finite density of the
distribution function in the $T_{K} \rightarrow 0$ limit while the typical
ferromagnetic transition temperature shows a phase transition at the critical
interaction parameter. We propose that the typical transition temperature
serves a criterion for quantum Griffiths phenomena vs. smeared transitions:
Quantum Griffiths phenomena occur above the typical value of the critical
temperature while smeared phase transitions result at low temperatures below
the typical transition temperature. We speculate that the ferromagnetic
transition at Anderson localization shows the evolution from quantum Griffiths
phenomena to smeared transitions around the critical interaction parameter at
low temperatures.

developed using IceCube data from the 59-string configuration of the detector.
27,771 neutrino candidates were detected in 346 days of livetime. A rejection

The unfolded spectrum of atmospheric muon neutrinos covers an energy range from
100 GeV to 1 PeV. Compared to the previous measurement using the detector in
the 40-string configuration, the analysis presented here, extends the upper end
of the atmospheric neutrino spectrum by more than a factor of two, reaching an
energy region that has not been previously accessed by spectral measurements.

axially-symmetric string loop initially oscillating in the vicinity of a
Schwarzschild black hole embedded in an external asymptotically uniform
magnetic field. The plane of the string loop is orthogonal to the magnetic
field lines and the acceleration of the string loop occurs due to the
transmutation effect turning in the deep gravitational field the internal
energy of the oscillating strings to the energy of their translational motion
along the axis given by the symmetry of the black hole spacetime and the
magnetic field. We restrict our attention to the motion of string loop with
energy high enough, when it can overcome the gravitational attraction and
escape to infinity. We demonstrate that for the current-carrying string loop
the transmutation effect is enhanced by the contribution of the interaction
between the electric current of the string loop and the external magnetic field
and we give conditions that have to be fulfilled for an efficient acceleration.
The Schwarzschild black hole combined with the strong external magnetic field
can accelerate the current-carrying string loop up to the velocities close to
the speed of light $v \sim c$. Therefore, the string loop transmutation effect
can potentially well serve as an explanation for acceleration of highly
relativistic jets observed in microquasars and active galactic nuclei.

emission in the initial pulses as well as in the early afterglow phase. As high
resolution spectral data of \emph{Swift}/XRT is available for the early
afterglow, we investigate the shape and evolution of the thermal component in
this phase using data from the \emph{Swift}/BAT, the \emph{Swift}/XRT, and the
\emph{Fermi}/GBM detectors. An independent fit to the BAT and XRT data reveals
two correlated blackbodies with monotonically decreasing temperatures. Hence we
investigated the combined data with a model consisting of two blackbodies and a
power-law (2BBPL), a model suggested for several bright GRBs. We elicit the
following interesting features of the 2BBPL model: a) the same model is
applicable from the peak of the last pulse in the prompt emission to the
afterglow emission, b) the ratio of temperatures and the fluxes of the two
black bodies remains constant throughout the observations, c) the black body
temperatures and fluxes show a monotonic decrease with time, with the BB fluxes
dropping about a factor of two faster than that of the power-law emission, d)
attributing the blackbody emission to photospheric emissions, we find that the
photospheric radii increase very slowly with time, and the lower temperature
blackbody shows a larger emitting radius than that of the higher temperature
black body. We find some evidence that the underlying shape of the non-thermal
emission is a cut-off power-law rather than a power-law. We sketch a
spine-sheath jet model to explain our observations.

parameterisation of DE/MG perturbations and compared it to data from the Planck
satellite and six galaxy catalogues, including temperature-galaxy (Tg), CMB
lensing-galaxy and galaxy-galaxy (gg) correlations. Combining these observables
of structure formation with tests of the background expansion allows us to
investigate the properties of DE/MG both at the background and the perturbative
level. Our constraints on DE/MG are mostly in agreement with the cosmological
constant paradigm, while we also find that the constraint on the equation of
state w (assumed to be constant) depends on the model assumed for the
perturbation evolution. We obtain $w=-0.92^{+0.20}_{-0.16}$ (95% CL; CMB+gg+Tg)
in the entropy perturbation scenario; in the anisotropic stress case the result
is $w=-0.86^{+0.17}_{-0.16}$. Including the lensing correlations shifts the
results towards higher values of w. If we include a prior on the expansion
history from recent Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) measurements, we find
that the constraints tighten closely around $w=-1$, making it impossible to
measure any DE/MG perturbation evolution parameters. If, however, upcoming
observations from surveys like DES, Euclid or LSST show indications for a
deviation from a cosmological constant, our formalism will be a useful tool

initial equilibrium configuration contains adjacent, oppositely directed,
parallel current channels. Since oppositely directed current channels repel,
the equilibrium is liable to an ideal magnetohydrodynamic tilt instability.
This tilt evolution, previously studied in planar settings, involves two
magnetic islands or fluxropes, which on Alfvenic timescales undergo a combined
rotation and separation. This in turn leads to the creation of (near) singular
current layers, posing severe challenges to numerical approaches. Using our
open-source grid-adaptive MPI-AMRVAC software, we revisit the planar evolution
case in compressible MHD, as well as its extension to 2.5D and full 3D
scenarios. As long as the third dimension remains ignorable, pure tilt
evolutions result which are hardly affected by out of plane magnetic field
components. In all 2.5D runs, our simulations do show secondary tearing type
disruptions throughout the near singular current sheets in the far nonlinear
saturation regime. In full 3D, both current channels can be liable to
additional ideal kink deformations. We discuss the effects of having both tilt
and kink instabilities acting simultaneously in the violent, reconnection
dominated evolution. In 3D, both the tilt and the kink instabilities can be
stabilized by tension forces. As a concrete space plasma application, we argue
that interacting tilt-kink instabilities in repelling current channels provide
a novel route to initiate solar coronal mass ejections, distinctly different
from currently favored pure kink or torus instability routes.

covariants is introduced in a context of quantum Clifford algebras on Minkowski
spacetime. Once the bilinear covariants are expressed in terms of algebraic
spinor fields, the duality between spinor and quantum spinor fields is thus
discussed. Hence, by endowing the underlying spacetime with an arbitrary
bilinear form with a antisymmetric part in addition to a symmetric spacetime
metric, quantum algebraic spinor fields and deformed bilinear covariants can be
constructed. They are therefore compared to the classical (non quantum) ones.
Classes of quantum spinor fields are introduced and compared with Lounesto's
spinor field classification. A physical interpretation of the deformed parts
and the underlying Z-grading is proposed. The existence of an arbitrary
bilinear form endowing the spacetime already has been explored in the
literature in the context of quantum gravity. Here, it is shown further to play
a prominent role in the structure of Dirac, Weyl, and Majorana spinor fields,
besides the most general flagpoles, dipoles and flag-dipoles ones as well. We
introduce a new duality between the standard and the quantum spinor fields, by
showing that when Clifford algebras over vector spaces endowed with an
arbitrary bilinear form are taken into account, a mixture among the classes
does occur. Consequently, novel features regarding the spinor fields can be
derived.

trajectories) ranging from $O(\theta)$ to $O(1/\omega b)$, and exactly
reproduces, at its lower end, a well-known zero-frequency limit.

measures simultaneously. For example, error is the sum of false positives and
false negatives and a univariate test on error cannot make a distinction
between these two sources, but a 2-variate test can. Similarly, instead of
combining precision and recall in $F$ measure, we can have a 2-variate test on

two algorithms, and when we have three or more algorithms we use the
multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) followed by pairwise post hoc tests.
In our experiments, we see that multivariate tests have higher power than

systems that are currently at the forefront of materials science research is
the ability to easily introduce a combination of planar deformations and
bending in the system. Since the electronic properties are ultimately
determined by the details of atomic orbital overlap, such mechanical
manipulations translate into modified electronic properties. Here, we present a
general-purpose optimization framework for tailoring physical properties of
two-dimensional electronic systems by manipulating the state of local strain,
allowing a one-step route from their design to experimental implementation. A
definite example, chosen for its relevance in light of current experiments in
graphene nanostructures, is the optimization of the experimental parameters
that generate a prescribed spatial profile of pseudomagnetic fields in
graphene. But the method is general enough to accommodate a multitude of
possible experimental parameters and conditions whereby deformations can be
imparted to the graphene lattice, and complies, by design, with graphene's
elastic equilibrium and elastic compatibility constraints. As a result, it
efficiently answers the inverse problem of determining the optimal values of a
set of external or control parameters that result in a graphene deformation
whose associated pseudomagnetic field profile best matches a prescribed target.
The ability to address this inverse problem in an expedited way is one key step
for practical implementations of the concept of two-dimensional systems with
electronic properties strain-engineered to order. The general-purpose nature of
this calculation strategy means that it can be easily applied to the
optimization of other relevant physical quantities which directly depend on the
local strain field, not just in graphene but in other two-dimensional
electronic membranes.

$\approx A_1/k$ when $k \gg 1$, where $A_1$ is independent of $m$. We estimate
$A_1=4.80\pm 0.05$. Within a Bethe approximation, we obtain $A_1=2$ and the
virial expansion truncated at second virial coefficient gives $A_1=1$. The
critical density for the nematic-columnar transition when $m=2$ is numerically
shown to tend to a value less than the full packing density as $k^{-1}$ when
$k\to \infty$. We find that the critical Binder cumulant for this transition is
non-universal and decreases as $k^{-1}$ for $k \gg 1$. However, the transition

data from the literature with measurements available of argon and alpha-capture
elements (S or Si), making up a total of 37 systems, i.e. the largest DLA argon
sample investigated so far. We confirm that argon is generally deficient in
DLAs, with a mean value [Ar/alpha]= -0.4+/-0.06dex (standard error of the
mean). The [Ar/alpha] ratios show a weak, positive trend with increasing NHI
and increasing absorption redshift, and a weak, negative trend with dust-free
metallicity, [S/H]. Detailed analysis of the abundance ratios indicates that
ArI ionisation, rather than dust depletion or nucleosynthetic evolution, is
responsible for the argon deficiency. Altogether, the observational evidence is
consistent with a scenario of argon ionisation dominated by quasar metagalactic
radiation modulated by local HI self-shielding inside the DLA host galaxies.
Our measurements and limits of argon abundances suggest that the cosmic
reionisation of HeII is completed above z=3, but more measurements at
z(abs)>3.5 are required to probe the final stages of this process of cosmic
reionisation.

Under thermal detailed balance conditions, the average occupation time is given
by the Boltzmann-Gibbs canonical law. But close to the non-ergodic phase, the
finite-time fluctuations around this mean are large and nontrivial. They
exhibit dual time scaling and distribution laws: the infinite density of large
fluctuations complements the L\'evy-stable density of bulk fluctuations.
Neither of the two should be interpreted as a stand-alone limiting law, as each
has its own deficiency: the infinite density has an infinite norm (despite
particle conservation), while the stable distribution has an infinite variance
(although occupation times are bounded). These unphysical divergences are
remedied by consistent use and interpretation of both formulas. Interestingly,
while the system's canonical equilibrium laws naturally determine the mean
occupation time of the ergodic motion, they also control the infinite and
L\'evy-stable densities of fluctuations. The duality of stable and infinite
densities is in fact ubiquitous for these dynamics, as it concerns the time
averages of general physical observables.

Earth-sized planet, Kepler-101c. These two planets orbit the slightly evolved
and metal-rich G-type star in 3.49 and 6.03 days, respectively. With mass
$M_{\rm p}=51.1_{-4.7}^{+5.1}~M_{\oplus}$, radius $R_{\rm

p}=1.45_{-0.48}^{+0.83} \rm g\;cm^{-3}$, Kepler-101b is the first
fully-characterized super-Neptune, and its density suggests that heavy elements
make up a significant fraction of its interior; more than $60\%$ of its total
mass. Kepler-101c has a radius of $1.25_{-0.17}^{+0.19}~R_{\oplus}$, which
implies the absence of any H/He envelope, but its mass could not be determined
due to the relative faintness of the parent star for highly precise
radial-velocity measurements ($K_{\rm p}=13.8$) and the limited number of
radial velocities. The $1~\sigma$ upper limit, $M_{\rm p} < 3.8~M_{\oplus}$,
excludes a pure iron composition with a $68.3\%$ probability. The architecture
of the Kepler-101 planetary system - containing a close-in giant planet and an
outer Earth-sized planet with a period ratio slightly larger than the 3:2
resonance - is certainly of interest for planet formation and evolution
scenarios. This system does not follow the trend, seen by Ciardi et al. (2013),
that in the majority of Kepler systems of planet pairs with at least one
Neptune-size or larger planet, the larger planet has the longer period.

growth solutions to the whole set of feasible flux phenotypes (FFP), which
provides a benchmark to assess the likelihood of optimal and high-growth states
and their agreement with experimental results. In addition, FFP maps are able
to uncover metabolic behaviors, such as aerobic fermentation accompanying
exponential growth on sugars at nutrient excess conditions, that are
unreachable using standard models based on optimality principles. The
information content of the full FFP space provides us with a map to explore and
evaluate metabolic behavior and capabilities, and so it opens new avenues for
biotechnological and biomedical applications.

irregularly shaped micrometer grains. Centimeter projectiles with different
diameters, masses and heights are used, their typical volume filling factor is

1.5kg, a diameter and height of 12cm and a mean filling factor of
$\Phi_{t,m}$=0.44+-0.004. At lower collision energies only the projectile gets
destroyed and mass is transferred to the target. The accretion efficiency
decreases with increasing obliquity and increasing difference in filling

distribution with average exponent of -3.8+-0.3. The mass distributions suggest
that the fraction of smallest fragments increases for higher collision

This

used in various contexts. In particular, the matrix version makes a bridge
between torus-invariant primes in generic quantum matrices, torus-orbits of
symplectic leaves in matrix Poisson varieties and totally nonnegative cells in
totally nonnegative matrix varieties [12]. This led to recent progress in the
study of totally nonnegative matrices such as new recognition tests, see for
instance [18]. The aim of this article is to develop a Poisson version of the
deleting derivations algorithm to study the members of a class P of polynomial
Poisson algebras. It has recently been shown that the Poisson Dixmier-Moeglin
equivalence does not hold for all polynomial Poisson algebras [2]. Our
algorithm allows us to prove this equivalence for a significant class of
Poisson algebras, when the base field is of characteristic zero. Finally, using
our deleting derivations algorithm, we compare topologically spectra of quantum

these interventions may inform public health efforts. We use existing data from
Liberia and Sierra Leone to parameterize a mathematical model of Ebola and use
this model to forecast the progression of the epidemic, as well as the efficacy
of several interventions, including increased contact tracing, improved
infection control practices, the use of a hypothetical pharmaceutical
intervention to improve survival in hospitalized patients. Model forecasts
until Dec. 31, 2014 show an increasingly severe epidemic with no sign of having
reached a peak. Modeling results suggest that increased contact tracing,
improved infection control, or a combination of the two can have a substantial
impact on the number of Ebola cases, but these interventions are not sufficient
to halt the progress of the epidemic. The hypothetical pharmaceutical
intervention, while impacting mortality, had a smaller effect on the forecasted
trajectory of the epidemic. Near-term, practical interventions to address the
ongoing Ebola epidemic may have a beneficial impact on public health, but they
will not result in the immediate halting, or even obvious slowing of the
epidemic. A long-term commitment of resources and support will be necessary to
address the outbreak.

a character of an irreducible representation of the Langlands dual group
$G^\vee( \mathbb{C} )$ ( a Schur function if $G = GL_n( \mathbb{Q}_p )$). We
propose a probabilistic approach to this claim, known as the
Shintani-Casselman-Shalika formula, when the group $G$ has at least one
minuscule cocharacter in the coweight lattice.
  Our presentation goes along the following lines. Thanks to a minuscule random
walk $W^{(z)}$ on the coweight lattice and a related random walk on the Borel
subgroup, we establish a Poisson kernel formula for the non-Archimedean
Whittaker function. The expression and its ingredients are similar to the one
previously obtained by the author in the Archimedean case. A simple
manipulation reduces the problem to evaluating the probability of $W^{(z)}$
never exiting the Weyl chamber. Then, an implementation of the reflection
principle forces the appearance of the Weyl character formula and therefore
retrieves characters of $G^\vee\left( \mathbb{C} \right)$.
  The construction of the random walk on the Borel subgroup requires some care.
It is extracted from a spherical random walk whose increments have a
distribution that can be understood as elements from the spherical Hecke
algebra.

the intersection numbers of the Gromov--Witten classes and their descendents
along with the characteristic classes of Hodge bundles on the moduli spaces of
stable maps. For the one-dimensional Frobenius manifold the Hodge hierarchy is
a deformation of the Korteweg--de Vries hierarchy depending on an infinite
number of parameters. Conjecturally this hierarchy is a universal object in the
class of scalar Hamiltonian integrable hierarchies possessing tau-functions.

Emotions in texts help
propagating messages in conventional advertising. In word of mouth scenarios,
emotions help to engage consumers and incite to propagate the message further.
While the function of emotions in offline marketing in general and word of
mouth marketing in particular is rather well understood, online marketing can
only offer a limited view on the function of emotions. In this contribution we
seek to close this gap. We therefore investigate how emotions function in
social media. To do so, we collected more than 30,000 brand marketing messages
from the Google+ social networking site. Using state of the art computational
linguistics classifiers, we compute the sentiment of these messages. Starting
out with Poisson regression-based baseline models, we seek to replicate earlier
findings using this large data set. We extend upon earlier research by
computing multi-level mixed effects models that compare the function of
emotions across different industries. We find that while the well known notion
of activating emotions propagating messages holds in general for our data as
well. But there are significant differences between the observed industries.

asteroids in addition to traditional reflectance measurements. In particular we
are interested in possible relationships between the wavelength-dependent
variation of linear polarization and the properties of the surfaces, including
albedo and composition.
  We have obtained optical spectro-polarimetric measurements of a dozen
asteroids of different albedo and taxonomic classes and of two small regions at
the limb of the Moon.
  We found that objects with marginally different relative reflectance spectra
(in the optical) may have totally different polarization spectra. This suggests
that spectro-polarimetry may be used to refine the classification of asteroids.
We also found that in some cases the Umov law may be violated, that is, in
contrast to what is expected from basic physical considerations, the fraction
of linear polarization and the reflectance may be positively correlated. In
agreement with a few previous studies based on multi-colour broadband
polarimetry, we found that the variation of linear polarization with wavelength
and with phase-angle is correlated with the albedo and taxonomic class of the
objects. Finally, we have serendipitously discovered that spinel-rich asteroid
(599) Luisa, located very close to the Watsonia family, is a member of the rare
class of Barbarian asteroids.
  We suggest that future modelling attempts of the surface structure of
asteroids should be aimed at explaining both reflectance and polarization
spectra.

sufficient to ensure that an art gallery, represented by a polygon $P$, is
fully guarded. In 1998, the problems of finding the minimum number of point
guards, vertex guards, and edge guards required to guard $P$ were shown to be
APX-hard by Eidenbenz, Widmayer and Stamm. In 1987, Ghosh presented
approximation algorithms for vertex guards and edge guards that achieved a
ratio of $\mathcal{O}(\log n)$, which was improved upto $\mathcal{O}(\log\log
OPT)$ by King and Kirkpatrick in 2011. It has been conjectured that
constant-factor approximation algorithms exist for these problems. We settle
the conjecture for the special class of polygons that are weakly visible from
an edge and contain no holes by presenting a 6-approximation algorithm for
finding the minimum number of vertex guards that runs in $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$
time. On the other hand, for weak visibility polygons with holes, we present a
reduction from the Set Cover problem to show that there cannot exist a
polynomial time algorithm for the vertex guard problem with an approximation
ratio better than $((1 - \epsilon)/12)\ln n$ for any $\epsilon>0$, unless NP=P.
We also show that, for the special class of polygons without holes that are
orthogonal as well as weakly visible from an edge, the approximation ratio can
be improved to 3. Finally, we consider the Point Guard problem and show that it
is NP-hard in the case of polygons weakly visible from an edge.

the problem of finding a tomographic protocol which is the most robust against
errors in terms of the lowest value (i.e., equal to 1) of a condition number,
as required by the Gastinel-Kahan theorem. In contrast, standard tomographic
protocols, including those based on mutually unbiased bases, are nonoptimal for
determining all 16 elements of an unknown two-qubit density matrix. Our method
is based on the measurements of the 16 generalized Pauli operators, where
twelve of them can be locally measured, and the other four require nonlocal
Bell measurements. Our method corresponds to selectively measuring, one by one,
all of the real and imaginary elements of an unknown two-qubit density matrix.
We describe two experimentally feasible setups of this protocol for the optimal
reconstruction of two photons in an unknown polarization state using
conventional detectors and linear-optical elements. Moreover, we define the
operators for the optimal reconstruction of the states of multiqubit or
multilevel (qudit) systems.

kinds of evidence to justify its top level claim. While assurance cases deliver
some level of guarantee of a system's correctness, they lack the rigor that
proofs from formal methods typically provide. Furthermore, changes in the
structure of a model during development may result in inconsistencies between a
design and its assurance case. Our solution is a framework for automatically
generating assurance cases based on 1) a system model specified in an
architectural design language, 2) a set of logical rules expressed in a domain
specific language that we have developed, and 3) the results of other formal
analyses that have been run on the model. We argue that the rigor of these
automatically generated assurance cases exceeds those of traditional assurance
case arguments because of their more formal logical foundation and direct
connection to the architectural model.

exhibit spontaneous polarization for sufficiently strong repulsive
interactions, a phenomenon which is called itinerant ferromagnetism. Recent
experiments with ultracold atomic gases have reached the interaction strength
for which theoretical models have predicted the occurrence of the
normal-to-itinerant-ferromagnetic phase transition, but so far this transition
has not been observed. The instability of the repulsive branch of the Feshbach
resonance prevents the formation of the itinerant ferromagnetic state, but it
is not clear whether this is the only instability impeding its experimental
realization. In this article, we use the path-integral formalism with density
fields in the Hubbard-Stratonovich transformation to study the stability of a
homogeneous two-component Fermi gas with contact interactions. Within the
saddle-point approximation we show that none of the extrema of the action are
minima, meaning all extrema are unstable to small density fluctuations. This
implies a more general mechanical instability of the polarized (itinerant
ferromagnetic) and normal states of the system in the path-integral formalism.
We find that it is important to consider the stability of the system when
studying itinerant ferromagnetism. Since (mechanical) stability may be
influenced by the details of the interaction potential, we suggest the use of a
more realistic potential than the contact potential in future theoretical
descriptions.

  The theory of F-crystals suggests that another invariant might be useful in
trying to improve the understanding of F-zips. Given an F-zip, we calculate for
every $1$-dimensional F-zip (of which there is essentially one for every

given by its wavelength which defines the domain of validity for these
coordinates known as the long-wavelength regime. The symmetry of this
spacetime, however, allows us to extend Fermi normal coordinates far beyond the
long-wavelength regime. Here we present an explicit construction for this
long-range Fermi normal coordinate system based on the unique solution of the
boundary-value problem for spacelike geodesics. The resulting formulae amount
to summation of the infinite series for Fermi normal coordinates previously
obtained with perturbation expansions. We also consider two closely related
normal coordinate systems: optical coordinates which are built from null
geodesics and wave-synchronous coordinates which are built from spacelike
geodesics locked in phase with the propagating gravitational wave. The
wave-synchronous coordinates yield the exact solution of Peres and Ehlers-Kundt
which is globally defined. In this case, the limitation of the long-wavelength

the mass of the BTZ BH is related with square root of the energy density of

assumed modified Chaplygin gas (MCG) as a candidate of dark energy which
accretes onto BH and we have found the expression of BTZ BH mass. Since in our
solution of MCG, this model generates only quintessence dark energy (not
phantom) and so BTZ BH mass increases during the whole evolution of the
accelerating universe. Next we have assumed 5 kinds of parametrizations of well
known dark energy models. These models generate both quintessence and phantom
scenarios i.e., phantom crossing models. So if these dark energies accrete onto
the BTZ BH, then in quintessence stage, BH mass increases upto a certain value
(finite value) and then decreases to a certain finite value for phantom stage
during whole evolution of the universe. We have shown these results

on the envelope and creating shocks, but the nature of these shocks is still
poorly understood. Our aim is to survey far-infrared molecular line emission
from a uniform and significant sample of deeply-embedded low-mass young stellar
objects in order to characterize shocks and the possible role of ultraviolet
radiation in the immediate protostellar environment. Herschel/PACS spectral
maps of 22 objects in the Perseus molecular cloud were obtained as part of the
`William Herschel Line Legacy' survey. Line emission from H$_\mathrm{2}$O, CO,
and OH is tested against shock models from the literature.
  Observed line ratios are remarkably similar and do not show variations with
source physical parameters. Observations show good agreement with the shock
models when line ratios of the same species are compared. Ratios of various
H$_\mathrm{2}$O lines provide a particularly good diagnostic of pre-shock gas
densities, $n_\mathrm{H}\sim10^{5}$ cm$^{-3}$, in agreement with typical
densities obtained from observations of the post-shock gas. The corresponding
shock velocities, obtained from comparison with CO line ratios, are above 20
km\,s$^{-1}$. However, the observations consistently show one-to-two orders of
magnitude lower H$_\mathrm{2}$O-to-CO and H$_\mathrm{2}$O-to-OH line ratios
than predicted by the existing shock models.
  The overestimated model H$_\mathrm{2}$O fluxes are most likely caused by an
overabundance of H$_\mathrm{2}$O in the models since the excitation is
well-reproduced. Illumination of the shocked material by ultraviolet photons
produced either in the star-disk system or, more locally, in the shock, would
decrease the H$_\mathrm{2}$O abundances and reconcile the models with
observations. Detections of hot H$_\mathrm{2}$O and strong OH lines support
this scenario.

that at each fixed length-scale any two neighbourhoods of the set have covers
of approximately equal cardinality.
  Self-similar sets are notable in that they are Ahlfors-David regular, which
implies that their Assouad and box-counting dimensions coincide. More
generally, attractors of non-autonomous iterated functions systems (where maps
are allowed to vary between iterations) can have distinct Assouad and
box-counting dimensions. Consequently the familiar notion of Ahlfors-David
regularity is too strong to be useful in the analysis of this important class
of sets, which include generalised Cantor sets and possess different
dimensional behaviour at different length-scales.
  We further develop the theory of equi-homogeneity showing that it is a weaker
property than Ahlfors-David regularity and distinct from any previously defined
notion of dimensional equivalence. However, we show that if the upper and lower
box-counting dimensions of an equi-homogeneous set are equal and `attained' in
a sense we make precise then the lower Assouad, Hausdorff, packing, lower

compute the Assouad dimension of a certain class of these highly non-trivial

crystalline VO2 micro/nanobeams by direct exposure to atomic hydrogen, without
catalyst. The atomic hydrogen is generated by a hot filament, and the doping
process takes place at moderate temperature (373 K). Undoped VO2 has a
metal-to-insulator phase transition at ~340 K between a high-temperature,
rutile, metallic phase and a low-temperature, monoclinic, insulating phase with
a resistance exhibiting a semiconductor-like temperature dependence. Atomic
hydrogenation results in stabilization of the metallic phase of VO2
micro/nanobeams down to 2 K, the lowest point we could reach in our measurement
setup. Based on observing the movement of the hydrogen diffusion front in
single crystalline VO2 beams, we estimate the diffusion constant for hydrogen
along the c-axis of the rutile phase to be 6.7 x 10^{-10} cm^2/s at
approximately 373 K, exceeding the value in isostructural TiO2 by ~ 38x.
Moreover, we find that the diffusion constant along the c-axis of the rutile
phase exceeds that along the equivalent a-axis of the monoclinic phase by at
least three orders of magnitude. This remarkable change in kinetics must
originate from the distortion of the ""channels"" when the unit cell doubles
along this direction upon cooling into the monoclinic structure. Ab initio
calculation results are in good agreement with the experimental trends in the
relative kinetics of the two phases. This raises the possibility of a
switchable membrane for hydrogen transport.

well and reliably for the wavelength calibration and the associated
rectification procedure, yet we find several weaknesses in the reduction
cascade that are addressed with additional calibration steps, such as bad pixel
interpolation, flat fielding, and slit illumination corrections. Furthermore,
the instrumental PSF is analytically modeled and used to reconstruct flux
losses at slit transit and for optimally extracting point sources. Regular
observations of spectrophotometric standard stars allow us to detect
instrumental variability, which needs to be understood if a reliable absolute
flux calibration is desired. A cascade of additional custom calibration steps
is presented that allows for an absolute flux calibration uncertainty of less
than ten percent under virtually every observational setup provided that the
signal-to-noise ratio is sufficiently high. The optimal extraction increases
the signal-to-noise ratio typically by a factor of 1.5, while simultaneously
correcting for resulting flux losses. The wavelength calibration is found to be
accurate to an uncertainty level of approximately 0.02 Angstrom. We find that
most of the X-shooter systematics can be reliably modeled and corrected for.
This offers the possibility of comparing observations on different nights and
with different telescope pointings and instrumental setups, thereby
facilitating a robust statistical analysis of large datasets.

on identification of the H-band lines and analysis of the emission peak
velocity separations (v_p) and emission peak intensity ratios (V/R) of the
usually double-peaked H I and non-hydrogen emission lines. H I Br11 emission is
found to preferentially form in the circumstellar disks at an average distance
of ~2.2 stellar radii. Increasing v_p toward the weaker Br12--Br20 lines
suggests these lines are formed interior to Br11. By contrast, the observed IR
Fe II emission lines present evidence of having significantly larger formation
radii; distinctive phase lags between IR Fe II and H I Brackett emission lines
further supports that these species arise from different radii in Be disks.
Several emission lines have been identified for the first time including
~16895, a prominent feature in the spectra for almost a fifth of the sample
and, as inferred from relatively large v_p compared to the Br11-Br20, a tracer
of the inner regions of Be disks. Unlike the typical metallic lines observed
for Be stars in the optical, the H-band metallic lines, such as Fe II 16878,
never exhibit any evidence of shell absorption, even when the H I lines are
clearly shell-dominated. The first known example of a quasi-triple-peaked Br11

triggered a spectacular outpouring of creative and innovative scientific
inquiry. Much has been learned over the ensuing 28 years about the novel forms
of quantum matter that are exhibited in this strongly correlated electron
system. This progress has been made possible by improvements in sample quality,
coupled with the development and refinement of advanced experimental
techniques. In part, avenues of inquiry have been motivated by theoretical
developments, and in part new theoretical frameworks have been conceived to
account for unanticipated experimental observations. An overall qualitative
understanding of the nature of the superconducting state itself has been
achieved, while profound unresolved issues have come into increasingly sharp
focus concerning the astonishing complexity of the phase diagram, the
unprecedented prominence of various forms of collective fluctuations, and the
simplicity and insensitivity to material details of the ""normal"" state at
elevated temperatures. New conceptual approaches, drawing from string theory,
quantum information theory, and various numerically implemented approximate
approaches to problems of strong correlations are being explored as ways to
come to grips with this rich tableaux of interrelated phenomena.

radio bursts are often associated with coronal mass ejections (CMEs). Both
phenomena may signify shock waves driven by CMEs. Taking EUV full-disk images
at an unprecedented cadence, the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) onboard the
Solar Dynamics Observatory has observed the so-called EIT waves or large-scale
coronal propagating fronts (LCPFs) from their early evolution, which coincides
with the period when most metric type II bursts occur. This article discusses
the relation of LCPFs as captured by AIA with metric type II bursts. We show
examples of type II bursts without a clear LCPF and fast LCPFs without a type
II burst. Part of the disconnect between the two phenomena may be due to the
difficulty in identifying them objectively. Furthermore, it is possible that
the individual LCPFs and type II bursts may reflect different physical
processes and external factors. In particular, the type II bursts that start at
low frequencies and high altitudes tend to accompany an extended arc- shaped
feature, which probably represents the 3D structure of the CME and the shock
wave around it, rather than its near-surface track, which has usually been
identified with EIT waves. This feature expands and propagates toward and
beyond the limb. These events may be characterized by stretching of field lines
in the radial direction, and be distinct from other LCPFs, which may be
explained in terms of sudden lateral expansion of the coronal volume. Neither
LCPFs nor type II bursts by themselves serve as necessary conditions for
coronal shock waves, but these phenomena may provide useful information on the
early evolution of the shock waves in 3D when both are clearly identified in
eruptive events.

How they were formed and evolved has not been well understood, although there

the mysteries is the existence of binary planetesimals with near-equal mass
components and highly eccentric orbits. These binary planetesimals are quite
different from the satellites observed in the asteroid belt region. The ratio
of the Hill radius to the physical radius of the planetesimals is much larger
for the outer region of the disk, compared to the inner region of the disk. The
Hill radius increases with the semi major axis. Therefore, planetesimals in the
outer region can form close and eccentric binaries, while those in the inner
region would simply collide. In this paper, we carried out $N$-body simulations
in different regions of the disk and studied if binaries form in the outer
region of the disk. We found that large planetesimals tend to form binaries. A
significant fraction of large planetesimals are components of the binaries.
Planetesimals that become the components of binaries eventually collide with a
third body, through three-body encounters. Thus, the existence of binaries can
enhance the growth rate of planetesimals in the Trans-Neptunian Object (TNO)

unsolved puzzle. Here we discuss the possibility that a significant part of the
observed low-frequency flux noise measured in these devices is ultimately
seeded by cosmological fluctuations. We consider a theory where a primordial
flux noise field left over in unchanged form from an early inflationary or
quantum gravity epoch of the universe intrinsically influences the phase
difference in SQUIDs and qubits. The perturbation seeds generated by this field
can explain in a quantitatively correct way the form and amplitude of measured
low-frequency flux noise spectra in SQUID devices if one takes as a source of
fluctuations the primordial power spectrum of curvature fluctuations as
measured by the Planck collaboration. Our model predicts flux noise with a
spectrum given by an $1/f^{2-n_s}$ spectrum, where $n_s=0.96$ is the spectral
index of the near-scale invariant primordial density fluctuations. For the
typical amplitude of this cosmologically generated universal flux noise we
theoretically calculate the average value $\delta \Phi /\Phi_0 =3.41 \cdot
10^{-6}$ at 1Hz. These theoretical predictions are in excellent agreement with
recent low-frequency flux noise measurements of various experimental groups.
Magnetic flux noise, so far mainly considered as a nuisance for electronic

gaugino mass in the superspace formalism of supergravity. In this paper, we
reexamine the gaugino mass term in this formalism by paying particular
attention to symmetry which controls gaugino masses in supergravity. We first
discuss super-Diffeomorphism invariance of path-integral measures of charged
superfields. As we will show, the super-Diffeomorphism invariant measure is not
invariant under a super-Weyl transformation, which is the origin of the anomaly
mediated gaugino mass. We show how the anomaly mediated gaugino mass is
expressed as a local operator in a Wilsonian effective action in a
super-Diffeomorphism covariant way. We also obtain a gaugino mass term
independent of the gauge choice of the fictitious super-Weyl symmetry in the
super-Weyl compensator formalism, which reproduces the widely accepted result.
Besides, we discuss how to reconcile the gaugino mass term in the local
Wilsonian effective action and the gaugino mass term appearing in a non-local
1PI quantum effective action.

measuring Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) performance of real time network.
The proposed model Biological Kurd Messenger (BIOKM) has two main goals: First
is to run the model efficiently, second is to obtain high TCP performance via
real time network using bio-computing technique, especially molecular
calculation because it provides wisdom results and it can exploit all
facilities of phylogentic analysis. To measure TCP performance two protocols
were selected Internet Relay Chat Daemon (IRCD) and File Transfer Protocol
(FTP), the BIOKM model consists of two applications Kurd Messenger Server Side
(KMSS) and Kurd Messenger Client Side (KMCS) written in Java programming
language by implementing algorithms of BIOKM Server and Client application. The
paper also includes the implementation of hybridized model algorithm based on
Neighbor-Joining (NJ) method to measure TCP performance, then implementing
algorithm of Little law (steady state) for single server queue as a comparison
with bio-computing algorithm. The results obtained by using bio-computing and
little law techniques show very good performance and the two techniques result
are very close to each other this is because of local implementation. The main
tools which have been used in this work can be divided into software and
hardware tools.

medium, it is not uncommon to find large amounts of data collected on almost
all measurable attributes, both in nature and man-made habitats. Weather in
particular has been an area of keen interest for researchers to develop more
accurate and reliable prediction models. This paper presents a set of
experiments which involve the use of prevalent machine learning techniques to
build models to predict the day of the week given the weather data for that
particular day i.e. temperature, wind, rain etc., and test their reliability
across four cities in Australia {Brisbane, Adelaide, Perth, Hobart}. The
results provide a comparison of accuracy of these machine learning techniques
and their reliability to predict the day of the week by analysing the weather
data. We then apply the models to predict weather conditions based on the
available data.

the qualitative study variable in simple random sampling using information on
an auxiliary variable. Asymptotic expressions of bias and mean square error of
the proposed class of estimators have been obtained. Asymptotic optimum
estimator has been investigated along with its approximate mean square error.
It has been shown that proposed generalized class of estimators are more
efficient than all the estimators considered by Singh et al. (2010) in case of
qualitative study variable. In addition theoretical findings are supported by
an empirical study based on real population to show the superiority of the
constructed estimators over others.

of Oxa18 molecules in the aggregates, fluorescence occurred from Oxa18 H
aggregates. This H aggregated band has substantial effect on the enhancement of
energy transfer from Oxa18 to sRhb both in solution and in ultrathin film.

resonance energy transfer (FRET) efficiency between two laser dyes in layer by
layer (LbL) self assembled film. The dyes Acraflavine and Rhodamine B were
attached onto the negative phosphate backbones of DNA in LbL film through
electrostatic attraction. Then FRET between these dyes was investigated.
Increase in pH or temperature causes the denaturation of DNA followed by coil
formation of single stranded DNA. As a result the FRET efficiency also changed
along with it. These observations demonstrated that by observing the change in
FRET efficiency between two laser dyes in presence of DNA it is possible to
detect the altered DNA conformation in the changed environment.

often depicted as separate realms of physics, each with its own formalism and
notion. This remains unsatisfactory with respect to the unity of nature and to
the necessary number of postulates. We uncover the intrinsic connection of
these areas of physics and describe them using a common symplectic Hamiltonian
formalism. Our approach is based on a proper distinction between variables and
constants, i.e. on a basic but rigorous ontology of time. We link these concept
with the obvious conditions for the possibility of measurements. The derived
consequences put the measurement problem of quantum mechanics and the
Copenhagen interpretation of the quantum mechanical wavefunction into
perspective. According to our (onto-) logic we find that spacetime can not be
fundamental. We argue that a geometric interpretation of symplectic dynamics
emerges from the isomorphism between the corresponding Lie algebra and the
representation of a Clifford algebra. Within this conceptional framework we
derive the dimensionality of spacetime, the form of Lorentz transformations and
of the Lorentz force and fundamental laws of physics as the Planck-Einstein
relation, the Maxwell equations and finally the Dirac equation.
