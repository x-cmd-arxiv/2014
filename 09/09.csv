triggered by the impact of the massive stars in the Orion OB association. From
the measurements of the lithium abundance and radial velocity, we confirm the
membership of our sample to the cloud. We use the equivalent widths of the

and the mass accretion rates, $\dot M_{\rm acc}$. We find in L1615/L1616 a
fraction of accreting objects ($\sim 30\%$), which is consistent with the
typical fraction of accretors in T associations of similar age ($\sim 3$ Myr).
The mass accretion rate for these stars shows a trend with the mass of the
central object similar to that found for other star-forming regions, with a
spread at a given mass which depends on the evolutionary model used to derive
the stellar mass. Moreover, the behavior of the $2MASS/WISE$ colors with $\dot
M_{\rm acc}$ indicates that strong accretors with $\log \dot M_{\rm acc} \gt
-8.5$ dex show large excesses in the $JHK{\rm s}$ bands, as in previous
studies. We also conclude that the accretion properties of the L1615/L1616

Lupus.

the physical properties of cell membranes. They make it possible for mechanical
pulses (solitons) to travel along nerve axons. In these pulses, a region of
solid phase travels in the liquid nerve membrane. These pulses display many
properties associated with the action potential in nerves. Both general and
local anesthetics lower melting temperatures of membranes. Thus, they make it
more difficult to excite the nerve membrane. Since hydrostatic pressure
increases melting temperatures, it counteracts anesthesia. This theory has the
virtue of providing a simple explanation of the famous Meyer-Overton
correlation, which states that the effectiveness of an anesthetic is
proportional to its solubility in the lipid membranes of cells. We offer
evidence that this concept if also applicable to local anesthesia. Finally, we

individuals have no choice but to blindly trust that these entities will

the Trustworthy that is responsible for the storage of this data but which can
also compute on it (provided first that all the institutions agree on this).

weighted sentence alignment problem of DeNero and Klein (2008). In particular,
we consider the complexity of finding an alignment that has a significant
overlap with an optimal alignment. We discuss ways of representing the solution
for the general weighted sentence alignment as well as phrases-to-words
alignment problem, and show that computing a string which agrees with the
optimal sentence partition on more than half (plus an arbitrarily small
polynomial fraction) positions for the phrases-to-words alignment is NP-hard.
For the general weighted sentence alignment we obtain such bound from the
agreement on a little over 2/3 of the bits. Additionally, we generalize the
Hamming distance approximation of a solution structure to approximating it with
respect to the edit distance metric, obtaining similar lower bounds.

with $|d(m)| \le \sqrt{2 \varepsilon} \exp(-\frac{\kappa_0}{2} |m|)$.
  Our derivation relies on the study of the approximation via Hill operators
with potentials $\tilde V (x) = \sum_{m \in \mathbb{Z}^\nu} c(m) \exp (2 \pi i
m \tilde \omega x)$, where $\tilde \omega$ is a rational approximation of
$\omega$. It turns out that the multi-scale analysis method of \cite{DG}
applies to these Hill operators. Namely, in \cite{DGL} we developed the
multi-scale analysis for the operators dual to the Hill operators in question.
The main estimates obtained in \cite{DGL} allow us here to establish the
estimates for the gap lengths and the Fourier coefficients in a form which is
considerably stronger than the estimates known in the theory of Hill operators
with analytic potentials in the general setting. Due to these estimates, the
approximation procedure for the quasi-periodic potentials is effective, despite
the fact that the rate of approximation $|\omega - \tilde \omega| \thicksim
\tilde T^{-\delta}$, $0 < \delta < 1/2$ is slow, on the scale of the period
$\tilde T$ of the Hill operator.

Markov chain Monte Carlo parameter estimation algorithm developed to recover
generic transient signals with latency of a few hours. Furthermore, we focus on
the first few years of the advanced detector era, when we expect to only have
two (2015) and later three (2016) operational detectors, all below design
sensitivity. These detector configurations can produce significantly different
sky localizations, which we quantify in detail. We observe a clear improvement
in localization of the average detected signal when progressing from
two-detector to three-detector networks, as expected. Although localization
depends on the waveform morphology, approximately 50% of detected signals would
be imaged after observing 100-200 deg$^2$ in 2015 and 60-110 deg$^2$ in 2016,
although knowledge of the waveform can reduce this to as little as 22 deg$^2$.
This is the first comprehensive study on sky localization capabilities for

  Regression and Generalized Ridge Regression for Big Data",,,,,"stat.ME","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Unlike the ordinary least-squares (OLS) estimator for the linear model, a
ridge regression linear model provides coefficient estimates via shrinkage,
usually with improved mean-square and prediction error. This is true especially
when the observed design matrix is ill-conditioned or singular, either as a
result of highly-correlated covariates or the number of covariates exceeding
the sample size. This paper introduces novel and fast marginal maximum
likelihood (MML) algorithms for estimating the shrinkage parameter(s) for the
Bayesian ridge and power ridge regression models, and an automatic plug-in MML
estimator for the Bayesian generalized ridge regression model. With the aid of
the singular value decomposition of the observed covariate design matrix, these
MML estimation methods are quite fast even for data sets where either the
sample size (n) or the number of covariates (p) is very large, and even when
p>n. On several real data sets varying widely in terms of n and p, the
computation times of the MML estimation methods for the three ridge models,
respectively, are compared with the times of other methods for estimating the
shrinkage parameter in ridge, LASSO and Elastic Net (EN) models, with the other
methods based on minimizing prediction error according to cross-validation or
information criteria. Also, the ridge, LASSO, and EN models, and their
associated estimation methods, are compared in terms of prediction accuracy.
Furthermore, a simulation study compares the ridge models under MML estimation,
against the LASSO and EN models, in terms of their ability to differentiate
between truly-significant covariates (i.e., with non-zero slope coefficients)
and truly-insignificant covariates (with zero coefficients).

sensitivity to the shear parameter $q = - d\ln\Omega/d\ln r $ is of interest to
investigate. Motivated by astrophysical disks, most (but not all) previous MRI
studies have focused on the Keplerian value of $ q=1.5$. Using simulation with
8 vertical density scale heights, we contribute to the subset of studies
addressing the the effect of varying $q$ in stratified numerical simulations.
We discuss why shearing boxes cannot easily be used to study $q>2$ and thus
focus on $q<2$. As per previous simulations, which were either unstratified or
stratified with a smaller vertical domain, we find that the $q$ dependence of
stress for the stratified case is not linear, contrary to the Shakura-Sunyaev
model. We find that the scaling agrees with \cite{1996MNRAS.281L..21A} who
found it to be proportional to the shear to vorticity ratio $q/(2-q)$. We also
find however, that the shape of the magnetic and kinetic energy spectra are
relatively insensitive to $q$ and that the ratio of Maxwell stress to magnetic
energy ratio also remains nearly independent of $q$. This is consistent with a
theoretical argument in which the rate of amplification of the azimuthal field
depends linearly on $q$ and the turbulent correlation time $\tau$ depends
inversely on $q$. As such, we measure the correlation time of the turbulence
and find that indeed it is inversely proportional to $q$.

resemblance between a pair of protein backbones in 3D has led Bereg et al. to
pose the Chain Pair Simplification problem (CPS). In this problem, given two
polygonal chains $A$ and $B$ of lengths $m$ and $n$, respectively, one needs to
simplify them simultaneously, such that each of the resulting simplified
chains, $A'$ and $B'$, is of length at most $k$ and the discrete \frechet\
distance between $A'$ and $B'$ is at most $\delta$, where $k$ and $\delta$ are
given parameters.
  In this paper we study the complexity of CPS under the discrete \frechet\
distance (CPS-3F), i.e., where the quality of the simplifications is also
measured by the discrete \frechet\ distance. Since CPS-3F was posed in 2008,
its complexity has remained open. However, it was believed to be \npc, since
CPS under the Hausdorff distance (CPS-2H) was shown to be \npc. We first prove
that the weighted version of CPS-3F is indeed weakly \npc\, even on the line,
based on a reduction from the set partition problem. Then, we prove that CPS-3F
is actually polynomially solvable, by presenting an $O(m^2n^2\min\{m,n\})$ time
algorithm for the corresponding minimization problem. In fact, we prove a
stronger statement, implying, for example, that if weights are assigned to the
vertices of only one of the chains, then the problem remains polynomially
solvable. We also study a few less rigid variants of CPS and present efficient
solutions for them.
  Finally, we present some experimental results that suggest that (the
minimization version of) CPS-3F is significantly better than previous
algorithms for the motivating biological application.

in the scaling analysis, we obtained scaling exponents in excellent agreement
with the KPZ class. We also propose a method to suppress these corrections,
which consists in divide the surface in bins of size $\varepsilon$ and use only
the maximal height inside each bin to do the statistics. Again, scaling

progress in establishing the star formation rate (SFR) at high redshift.
Concurrently observed gamma-ray burst rates have also been used to extract the
SFR at high redshift. The SFR in turn can be used to make a host of predictions
concerning the ionization history of the Universe, the chemical abundances, and
supernova rates. We compare the predictions made using a hierarchical model of
cosmic chemical evolution based on three recently proposed SFRs: two based on
extracting the SFR from the observed gamma-ray burst rate at high redshift, and
one based on the observed galaxy luminosity function at high redshift. Using
the WMAP/Planck data on the optical depth and epoch of reionization, we find
that only the SFR inferred from gamma-ray burst data at high redshift suffices
to allow a single mode (in the initial mass function) of star formation which
extends from z = 0 to redshifts > 10. For the case of the more conservative SFR
based on the observed galaxy luminosity function, the reionization history of
the Universe requires a bimodal IMF which includes at least a coeval high (or
intermediate) mass mode of star formation at high redshift (z> 10). Therefore,
we also consider here a more general bimodal case which includes an
early-forming high mass mode as a fourth model to test the chemical history of
the Universe. We compute the abundances of several trace elements, as well as
the expected supernova rates, the stellar mass density and the specific SFR,
sSFR, as a function of redshift
  for each of the four models considered. We conclude that observational
constraints on the global metallicity and optical depth at high redshift favor
unseen faint but active star forming galaxies as pointed out in many recent
studies.

the gravitational and intrinsic effects are manifest. This approach can be
considered as a generalization of the remapping approach of CMB lensing, where
all the gravitational effects can be treated on the same footing.

correspondences between different images. These algorithms detect and compare
stable local invariant descriptors centered at scale-invariant keypoints.
Because of the importance of the problem, new keypoint detectors and
descriptors are constantly being proposed, each one claiming to perform better
(or to be complementary) to the preceding ones. This raises the question of a
fair comparison between very diverse methods. This evaluation has been mainly
based on a repeatability criterion of the keypoints under a series of image
perturbations (blur, illumination, noise, rotations, homotheties, homographies,
etc). In this paper, we argue that the classic repeatability criterion is
biased towards algorithms producing redundant overlapped detections. To
compensate this bias, we propose a variant of the repeatability rate taking
into account the descriptors overlap. We apply this variant to revisit the
popular benchmark by Mikolajczyk et al., on classic and new feature detectors.
Experimental evidence shows that the hierarchy of these feature detectors is
severely disrupted by the amended comparator.

dominant disc growth mechanism is viscous spreading, and another in which
continuous infall of matter prevails. The results show that the infall path
influences the abundance of methanol entering each type of disc, ranging from
complete loss of methanol to an enhancement by a factor of > 1 relative to the

submillimeter telescope in Chile and the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer
(WISE). WISE observes in four mid-infrared bands centered at 3.4, 4.6, 12 and
22 micron with angular resolutions ranging from 6 to 12 arcseconds. The WISE
and LABOCA maps reveal emission from dust in the central 2 arcminutes of NGC
1316. The disturbed optical morphology with many shells and loops, the complex
distribution of molecular gas and our dust maps are evidences of past merger
activity or gas accretion in the galaxy. Combining the LABOCA flux measurement
with existing mid- and far-infrared measurements, we estimate the temperature
of the cold (~20 K) and warm (~55 K) dust components in the galaxy. This study
will be extended to other southern radio galaxies and merger remnants. Those
galaxies are good targets for future observations at higher angular resolution
and sensitivity with ALMA to probe the interaction of the radio jets with the
dusty molecular gas near active galactic nuclei.

management is one of the fundamental research challenges for such multi-tier

present three novel approaches for distributed resource allocation in such
networks utilizing the concepts of stable matching, factor-graph based message

with respect to a practical radio resource allocation problem. In particular,
we consider a multi-tier network consisting a macro base station (MBS), a set
of small cell base stations (SBSs) and corresponding small cell user equipments
(SUEs), as well as D2D user equipments (DUEs). There is a common set of radio
resources (e.g., resource blocks [RBs]) available to the network tiers (e.g.,
MBS, SBSs and DUEs). The SUEs and DUEs use the available resources (e.g., RB

the macro tier (e.g., macro user equipments [MUEs]) remains below a given
threshold. Followed by a brief theoretical overview of the modeling tools
(e.g., stable matching, message passing and auction algorithm), we present the
distributed solution approaches for the resource allocation problem in the

configuration that minimizes a given discrete objective function. An
interpretation of such a function as the energy of a classical system allows us
to reduce the optimization problem into the preparation of a low-temperature
thermal state of the system. Motivated by the quantum annealing method, we
present three strategies to prepare the low-temperature state that exploit
quantum mechanics in remarkable ways. We focus on implementations without
uncontrolled errors induced by the environment. This allows us to rigorously
prove a quantum advantage. The first strategy uses a classical-to-quantum
mapping, where the equilibrium properties of a classical system in $d$ spatial
dimensions can be determined from the ground state properties of a quantum
system also in $d$ spatial dimensions. We show how such a ground state can be
prepared by means of quantum annealing, including quantum adiabatic evolutions.
This mapping also allows us to unveil some fundamental relations between
simulated and quantum annealing. The second strategy builds upon the first one
and introduces a technique called spectral gap amplification to reduce the time
required to prepare the same quantum state adiabatically. If implemented on a
quantum device that exploits quantum coherence, this strategy leads to a
quadratic improvement in complexity over the well-known bound of the classical
simulated annealing method. The third strategy is not purely adiabatic;
instead, it exploits diabatic processes between the low-energy states of the
corresponding quantum system. For some problems it results in an exponential
speedup (in the oracle model) over the best classical algorithms.

function of overall heavy element abundance as actually observed in MW bulge

bulge mimic elliptical galaxies better than solar neighborhood stars do, but
the MW bulge does not match elliptical galaxies, either. Comparing bulge versus
elliptical galaxies, Fe, Ti, and Mg trend about the same for both but C, Na,

  Exploring the behavior of abundance compositeness leads to the concepts of
""red lean"" where a narrower ADF appears more metal rich than a wide one, and
""red spread"" where the spectral difference between wide and narrow ADFs
increases as the ADF peak is moved to more metal-rich values. Tests on the
systematics of recovering abundance, abundance pattern, and age from composite
stellar populations using single stellar population models were performed. The
chemical abundance pattern was recovered adequately, though a few minor
systematic effects were uncovered. The prospects of measuring the width of the
ADF of an old stellar population were investigated and seem bright using UV to

radius, velocity dispersion, and surface brightness, has long been recognized
as a unique tool for analyzing galaxy structure and evolution. With the
discovery of distant quiescent galaxies and the introduction of high
sensitivity near-infrared spectrographs, it is now possible to explore the FP
out to z~2. In this Letter we study the evolution of the FP out to z~2 using
kinematic measurements of massive quiescent galaxies ($M_{*}>10^{11}
M_{\odot}$). We find preliminary evidence for the existence of an FP out to
z~2. The scatter of the FP, however, increases from z~0 to z~2, even when
taking into account the larger measurement uncertainties at higher redshifts.
We find a strong evolution of the zero point from z~2 to z~0:
$\Delta\log_{10}M/L_g\propto(-0.49\pm0.03)~z$. In order to assess whether our
spectroscopic sample is representative of the early-type galaxy population at
all redshifts, we compare their rest-frame g-z colors with those from a larger
mass complete sample of quiescent galaxies. At z>1 we find that the
spectroscopic sample is bluer. We use the color offsets to estimate a
mass-to-light ratio (M/L) correction. The implied FP zero point evolution after
correction is significantly smaller: $\Delta\log_{10}M/L_g\propto(-0.39\pm
0.02)~z$. This is consistent with an apparent formation redshift of
$z_{\rm{form}}=6.62^{+3.19}_{-1.44}$ for the underlying population, ignoring
the effects of progenitor bias. A more complete spectroscopic sample is
required at z~2 to properly measure the M/L evolution from the FP evolution.

perturbed onto WD-grazing orbits following stellar mass loss. In this work we
investigate the tidal disruption of these highly-eccentric (e > 0.98) asteroids

disruption timescale and compare the result with fully self-consistent

that this timescale is highly dependent on the orbit's pericentre and largely
independent of its semimajor axis. We establish that spherical asteroids

infrared (IR) observations using the physical dust model presented by Draine
and Li in 2007 (DL). We study the performance and results of this model, and
discuss implications for future dust modelling. The present work extends the DL
dust modelling carried out on nearby galaxies using Herschel and Spitzer data
to Galactic dust emission. We employ the DL dust model to generate maps of the
dust mass surface density, the optical extinction Av, and the starlight
intensity parametrized by Umin. The DL model reproduces the observed spectral
energy distribution (SED) satisfactorily over most of the sky, with small
deviations in the inner Galactic disk and in low ecliptic latitude areas. We
compare the DL optical extinction Av for the diffuse interstellar medium with
optical estimates for 2 10^5 quasi-stellar objects (QSOs) observed in the Sloan
digital sky survey. The DL Av estimates are larger than those determined
towards QSOs by a factor of about 2, which depends on Umin. The DL fitting
parameter Umin, effectively determined by the wavelength where the SED peaks,
appears to trace variations in the far-IR opacity of the dust grains per unit
Av, and not only in the starlight intensity. To circumvent the model
deficiency, we propose an empirical renormalization of the DL Av estimate,
dependent of Umin, which compensates for the systematic differences found with
QSO observations. This renormalization also brings into agreement the DL Av
estimates with those derived for molecular clouds from the near-IR colours of
stars in the 2 micron all sky survey. The DL model and the QSOs data are used
to compress the spectral information in the Planck and IRAS observations for
the diffuse ISM to a family of 20 SEDs normalized per Av, parameterized by
Umin, which may be used to test and empirically calibrate dust models.

coupled systems is developed. In such systems, the excitations of the bound
state are often delocalized and characterized by a large entropy, so that the
bound state is strongly entangled with the rest of the statistical system. If
this entropy $S$ increases with the separation $r$ between the constituents of
the bound state, $S = S(r)$, then the resulting entropic force $F = T\
{\partial S}/{\partial r}$ ($T$ is temperature) can drive the dissociation
process. As a specific example, we consider the case of heavy quarkonium in
strongly coupled quark-gluon plasma, where lattice QCD indicates a large amount
of entropy associated with the heavy quark pair at temperatures $0.9\ T_c \leq
T \leq 1.5\ T_c$ ($T_c$ is the deconfinement temperature); this entropy $S(r)$
grows with the inter-quark distance $r$. We argue that the entropic mechanism
results in an anomalously strong quarkonium suppression in the temperature
range near $T_c$. This ""entropic self-destruction"" may thus explain why the
experimentally measured quarkonium nuclear modification factor at RHIC (lower
energy density) is smaller than at LHC (higher energy density), possibly
resolving the ""quarkonium suppression puzzle"" - all of the previously known
mechanisms of quarkonium dissociation operate more effectively at higher energy
densities, and this contradicts the data. Moreover, we find that near $T_c$ the
entropic force leads to delocalization of the bound hadron states; we argue
that this delocalization may be the mechanism underlying deconfinement.

temperature. All of the sources in our 250 {\mu}m-selected sample have
spectroscopic redshifts, as well as 1.4 GHz flux density estimates measured
from the Faint Images of the Radio Sky at Twenty centimetres (FIRST) survey.
This enables us to study not only individual sources, but also the average
properties of the 250 {\mu}m selected population using median stacking
techniques. We find that individual sources detected at $\geq 5\sigma$ in both
the H-ATLAS and FIRST data have logarithmic flux ratios (i.e. FIRC $q_\lambda$
parameters) consistent with previous studies of the FIRC. In contrast, the
stacked values show larger $q_\lambda$, suggesting excess far-IR flux
density/luminosity in 250{\mu}m selected sources above what has been seen in
previous analyses. In addition, we find evidence that 250 {\mu}m sources with
warm dust SEDs have a larger 1.4 GHz luminosity than the cooler sources in our

FIRC, our analysis reveals significant temperature dependence. Whilst the FIRC
is reasonably constant with temperature at 100 {\mu}m, we find increasing
inverse correlation with temperature as we probe longer PACS and SPIRE

measurements distributed over 21 photometric passbands spanning wavelengths
from 0.19 to 2.2 microns. The light curve differences among the Type II-Plateau

expansion, which we explain as different density profiles of the ejecta and we
argue that steeper density profiles result in flatter plateaus, if everything
else remains unchanged. The steep luminosity decline of Type II-Linear
supernovae is due to fast evolution of the photospheric temperature, which we
verify with a successful fit of SN1980K. Eliminating the need for theoretical
supernova atmosphere models, we obtain self-consistent relative distances,
reddenings, and nickel masses fully accounting for all internal model

construct spectral energy distributions and bolometric light curves. We produce
bolometric corrections for all filter combinations in our sample. We compare
our model to the theoretical dilution factors and find good agreement for the B

four particles from getting close together to explore nonuniversal features of
the interactions at short distances. This result is an extension of the
universality in Efimov trimers that the appearance of the repulsive barrier at

lengths independent of the short-range details of the interactions as reported

estimates over a large wavelength range. We determine the center of mass of the
ONC, and study the radial dependence of angular substructure. The core appears
rounder and smoother than the outskirts, consistent with a higher degree of
dynamical processing. At larger distances the departure from circular symmetry
is mostly driven by the elongation of the system, with very little additional
substructure, indicating a somewhat evolved spatial morphology or an expanding
halo. We determine the mass density profile of the cluster, which is well
fitted by a power law that is slightly steeper than a singular isothermal
sphere. Together with the ISM density, estimated from average stellar
extinction, the mass content of the ONC is insufficient by a factor $\sim 1.8$
to reproduce the observed velocity dispersion from virialized motions, in
agreement with previous assessments that the ONC is moderately supervirial.
This may indicate recent gas dispersal. Based on the latest estimates for the
age spread in the system and our density profiles, we find that, at the
half-mass radius, 90% of the stellar population formed within $\sim 5$-$8$

from the $90^\circ$ scattering angle and low optical depth experienced by

can be a threat to life. Using recent determinations of the rate of GRBs, their
luminosity function and properties of their host galaxies, we estimate the
probability that a life-threatening (lethal) GRB would take place. Amongst the
different kinds of GRBs, long ones are most dangerous. There is a very good
chance (but no certainty) that at least one lethal GRB took place during the
past 5 Gyr close enough to Earth as to significantly damage life. There is a
50% chance that such a lethal GRB took place during the last 500 Myr causing
one of the major mass extinction events. Assuming that a similar level of
radiation would be lethal to life on other exoplanets hosting life, we explore
the potential effects of GRBs to life elsewhere in the Galaxy and the Universe.
We find that the probability of a lethal GRB is much larger in the inner Milky
Way (95% within a radius of 4 kpc from the galactic center), making it
inhospitable to life. Only at the outskirts of the Milky Way, at more than 10
kpc from the galactic center, this probability drops below 50%. When
considering the Universe as a whole, the safest environments for life (similar
to the one on Earth) are the lowest density regions in the outskirts of large
galaxies and life can exist in only ~ 10% of galaxies. Remarkably, a
cosmological constant is essential for such systems to exist. Furthermore,
because of both the higher GRB rate and galaxies being smaller, life as it

interpolation series for central values of self-dual Rankin-Selberg
$L$-functions for $\operatorname{GL}_2$ in dihedral towers of CM fields, using
expressions of these central values as automorphic periods. The main novelty of
this construction, apart from the level of generality in which it works, is
that it is completely local. We give the construction here for a cuspidal
automorphic representation of $\operatorname{GL}_2$ over a totally real field
corresponding to a $\mathfrak{p}$-ordinary Hilbert modular forms of parallel
weight two and trivial character, although a similar approach can be taken in
any setting where the underlying $\operatorname{GL}_2$-representation can be
chosen to take values in a discrete valuation ring. A certain choice of vectors
allows us to establish a precise interpolation formula thanks to theorems of
Martin-Whitehouse and File-Martin-Pitale. Such interpolation formulae had been
conjectured by Bertolini-Darmon in antecedent works. Our construction also
gives a conceptual framework for the nonvanishing theorems of Cornut-Vatsal in
that it describes the underlying theta elements. To highlight this latter
point, we describe how the construction extends in the parallel weight two
setting to give a $p$-adic interpolation series for central derivative values
when the root number is generically equal to $-1$, in which case the formula of
Yuan-Zhang-Zhang can be used to give an interpolation formula in terms of
heights of CM points on quaternionic Shimura curves.

protoplanetary disks threaded by net vertical magnetic field Bz. All three
non-ideal MHD effects, Ohmic resistivity, the Hall effect and ambipolar
diffusion are included in a self-consistent manner based on equilibrium
chemistry. We focus on regions toward outer disk radii, from 5-60AU, where
Ohmic resistivity tends to become negligible, ambipolar diffusion dominates
over an extended region across disk height, and the Hall effect largely
controls the dynamics near the disk midplane. We find that around R=5AU, the
system launches a laminar/weakly turbulent magnetocentrifugal wind when the net
vertical field Bz is not too weak, as expected. Moreover, the wind is able to
achieve and maintain a configuration with reflection symmetry at disk midplane.
The case with anti-aligned field polarity (Omega. Bz<0) is more susceptible to
the MRI when Bz drops, leading to an outflow oscillating in radial directions
and very inefficient angular momentum transport. At the outer disk around and
beyond R=30AU, the system shows vigorous MRI turbulence in the surface layer
due to far-UV ionization, which efficiently drives disk accretion. The Hall
effect affects the stability of the midplane region to the MRI, leading to
strong/weak Maxwell stress for aligned/anti-aligned field polarities.
Nevertheless, the midplane region is only very weakly turbulent. Overall, the
basic picture is analogous to the conventional layered accretion scenario
applied to the outer disk. In addition, we find that the vertical magnetic flux
is strongly concentrated into thin, azimuthally extended shells in most of our
simulations beyond 15AU. This is a generic phenomenon unrelated to the Hall
effect, and leads to enhanced zonal flow. Observational and theoretical
implications, as well as future prospects are briefly discussed.

enhances the level of turbulence via the magnetorotational instability (MRI).
Using shearing-box simulations, we find that such external magnetic flux also
strongly enhances the amplitude of banded radial density variations known as
zonal flows. Moreover, we report that vertical magnetic flux is strongly
concentrated toward low-density regions of the zonal flow. Mean vertical
magnetic field can be more than doubled in low-density regions, and reduced to
nearly zero in high density regions in some cases. In ideal MHD, the scale on
which magnetic flux concentrates can reach a few disk scale heights. In the
non-ideal MHD regime with strong ambipolar diffusion, magnetic flux is
concentrated into thin axisymmetric shells at some enhanced level, whose size
is typically less than half a scale height. We show that magnetic flux
concentration is closely related to the fact that the magnetic diffusivity of
the MRI turbulence is anisotropic. In addition to a conventional Ohmic-like
turbulent resistivity, we find that there is a correlation between the vertical
velocity and horizontal magnetic field fluctuations that produces a mean
electric field that acts to anti-diffuse the vertical magnetic flux. The
anisotropic turbulent diffusivity has analogies to the Hall effect, and may
have important implications for magnetic flux transport in accretion disks. The
physical origin of magnetic flux concentration may be related to the
development of channel flows followed by magnetic reconnection, which acts to
decrease the mass-to-flux ratio in localized regions. The association of
enhanced zonal flows with magnetic flux concentration may lead to global
pressure bumps in protoplanetary disks that helps trap dust particles and
facilitates planet formation.

an unanswered question. One of the most essential observables needed in its
modelling are the metallicity distribution and the trends of the alpha elements
as measured in stars. While Bulge regions beyond R > 50 pc of the centre has
been targeted in several surveys, the central part has escaped detailed study
due to the extreme extinction and crowding. The abundance gradients from the
center are, however, of large diagnostic value. Aims. We aim at investigating
the Galactic Centre environment by probing M giants in the field, avoiding
supergiants and cluster members. Methods. For 9 field M-giants in the Galactic
Centre region, we have obtained high- and low-resolution spectra observed
simultaneously with CRIRES and ISAAC on UT1 and UT3 of the VLT. The
low-resolution spectra provide a means of determining the effective
temperatures, and the high-resolution spectra provide detailed abundances of
Fe, Mg, Si, and Ca. Results. We find a metal-rich population at
[Fe/H]=+0.11+-0.15 and a lack of the metal-poor population, found further out
in the Bulge, corroborating earlier studies. Our [alpha/Fe] element trends,
however, show low values, following the outer Bulge trends. A possible
exception of the [Ca/Fe] trend is found and needs further investigation.
Conclusions. The results of the analysed field M-giants in the Galactic Centre
region, excludes a scenario with rapid formation, in which SNIIe played a
dominated role in the chemical enrichment of the gas. The metal-rich
metallicities together with low alpha-enhancement seems to indicate a bar-like
population perhaps related to the nuclear bar.

consideration of inequalities with abstract weights, by means of leveraging the
Hermiticity of quantum states. Recognizing that classical correlations
correspond to measurements made on separable states, we also introduce a
practical method for obtaining sufficient separability criteria. We
specifically vet the candidacy of driven and undriven superradiance as schema
for entanglement generation. We conclude by reviewing current approaches to
quantum contextuality, emphasizing the operational distinction between nonlocal
and contextual quantum statistics. We utilize our abstractly-weighted linear
quantum bounds to explicitly demonstrate a set of conditional probability
distributions which are simultaneously compatible with quantum contextuality
while being incompatible with quantum nonlocality. It is noted that this novel
statistical regime implies an experimentally-testable target for the Consistent

nearby ULIRG Arp 220. We find that the spectral sequence extending from normal
starburst-type emission line spectra to ULIRG-type absorption-dominated spectra
with significant absorption from excited levels, can be best explained by
simultaneously increasing the hydrogen column density, from as low as 10$^{21}$
cm$^{-2}$ to as high as 10$^{24.8}$ cm$^{-2}$ or greater, and the ionization
parameter, from as low as 10$^{-4}$ to as high as 1. The starburst models best

algebra of general linear superalgebras. For classical Lie superalgebras, any
primitive ideal is the annihilator of a simple highest weight module. It
therefore suffices to study the quasi-order on highest weights determined by
the relation of inclusion between primitive ideals. For the specific case of
reductive Lie algebras, this quasi-order is essentially the left
Kazhdan-Lusztig quasi-order. For Lie superalgebras, the classification is
unknown in general, safe from some low dimensional specific cases. We derive an
alternative definition of the left Kazhdan-Lusztig quasi-order which extends to
classical Lie superalgebras. We show that a relation in this preorder implies
an inclusion between primitive ideals.
  For gl(m|n) the new quasi-order is defined explicitly in terms of Brundan's
Kazhdan-Lusztig theory. We prove that the quasi-order induces an actual partial
order on the set of primitive ideals. We conjecture that this is the inclusion

prove several consistency results concerning the conjecture and prove it for
singly atypical and typical blocks of gl(m|n) and in general for gl(2|2). An

the ocean of an accreting neutron star, and the subsequent enrichment of the
ocean in light elements and inward transport of heat through convective mixing.
We extend the steady-state results of Medin & Cumming 2011 to transiently
accreting neutron stars, by considering the time-dependent cases of heating
during accretion outbursts and cooling during quiescence. Convective mixing is
extremely efficient, flattening the composition profile in about one convective
turnover time (weeks to months at the base of the ocean). During accretion
outbursts, inward heat transport has only a small effect on the temperature
profile in the outer layers until the ocean is strongly enriched in light
elements, a process that takes hundreds of years to complete. During
quiescence, however, inward heat transport rapidly cools the outer layers of
the ocean while keeping the inner layers hot. We find that this leads to a
sharp drop in surface emission at around a week followed by a gradual recovery
as cooling becomes dominated by the crust. Such a dip should be observable in
the light curves of these neutron star transients, if enough data is taken at a
few days to a month after the end of accretion. If such a dip is definitively
observed, it will provide strong constraints on the chemical composition of the
ocean and outer crust.

various cloud properties as measured from a sample of synthetic column density
maps of molecular clouds. We find that, as a cloud evolves, the peak of its

threshold for detection, resulting in an underlying lognormal distribution
which has been effectively lost at late times. Our results explain why certain
observations of actively star-forming, dynamically older clouds, such as the
Orion molecular cloud, do not appear to have any evidence of a lognormal
distribution in their column density PDFs. We also study the evolution of the
slope and deviation point of the power-law tails for our sample of simulated

the solar nebula. The present work is concerned with the gravitational collapse
of such clumps, idealized as being spherically symmetric. Calculations using
the two-fluid model are performed (almost) up to the time when a central
density singularity forms. The end result of the study is a parametrization for
this time, in order that it may be compared with timescales for various
disruptive effects to which clumps may be subject. An important effect is that
as the clump compresses, it also compresses the gas due to drag. This increases
gas pressure which retards particle collapse and leads to oscillation in the
size and density of the clump. The ratio of gravitational force to gas pressure
gives a two-phase Jeans parameter, $J_t$, which is the classical Jeans
parameter with the sound speed replaced by an the wave speed in a coupled
two-fluid medium. Its use makes the results insensitive to the initial density
ratio of particles to gas as a separate parameter. An ordinary differential
equation model is developed which takes the form of two coupled non-linear
oscillators and reproduces key features of the simulations. Finally, a
parametric study of the time to collapse is performed and a formula (fit to the
simulations) is developed. In the incompressible limit $J_t \to 0$, collapse
time equals sedimentation time. As $J_t$ increases, the collapse time decreases
roughly linearly with $J_t$ until $J_t \gtrsim 0.4$ when it becomes
approximately equal to the dynamical time.

often arise from stimulus-response maps, associating to each neuron a convex
receptive field. An important problem confronted by the brain is to infer
properties of a represented stimulus space without knowledge of the receptive
fields, using only the intrinsic structure of the neural code. How does the
brain do this? To address this question, it is important to determine what
stimulus space features can - in principle - be extracted from neural codes.
This motivates us to define the neural ring and a related neural ideal,
algebraic objects that encode the full combinatorial data of a neural code. We
find that these objects can be expressed in a ""canonical form"" that directly
translates to a minimal description of the receptive field structure intrinsic
to the neural code. We consider the algebraic properties of homomorphisms
between neural rings, which naturally relate to maps between neural codes. We
show that maps between two neural codes are in bijection with ring
homomorphisms between the respective neural rings, and define the notion of
neural ring homomorphism, a special restricted class of ring homomorphisms

large data sets that are too big to be analyzed in their entirety, due to
restrictions on computer memory or storage size. New Bayesian methods have been
developed for large data sets that are only large due to large sample sizes;
these methods partition big data sets into subsets, and perform independent
Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo analyses on the subsets. The methods then
combine the independent subset posterior samples to estimate a posterior
density given the full data set. These approaches were shown to be effective
for Bayesian models including logistic regression models, Gaussian mixture
models and hierarchical models. Here, we introduce the R package
parallelMCMCcombine which carries out four of these techniques for combining
independent subset posterior samples. We illustrate each of the methods using a
Bayesian logistic regression model for simulation data and a Bayesian Gamma
model for real data; we also demonstrate features and capabilities of the R
package. The package assumes the user has carried out the Bayesian analysis and
has produced the independent subposterior samples outside of the package. The
methods are primarily suited to models with unknown parameters of fixed
dimension that exist in continuous parameter spaces. We envision this tool will
allow researchers to explore the various methods for their specific
applications, and will assist future progress in this rapidly developing field.

the structural properties observed over particular representations do not

current database analytics algorithms will still provide the correct insights,

algorithms tend to be highly effective over some choices of structure, such as

\rho=\rho_n-\rho_p$ and $\rho=\rho_n+\rho_p$. We find that the larger the
isospin asymmetry $\delta \rho$ and smaller the total density $\rho$, the more
enhanced the mixing angle. We show that the decay width in the nuclear medium
has an additional density dependence which cannot be renormalized into that of
the mixing angle: The additional term originates from the vertex proportional
to a low energy constant $c_1$, which only comes into play in the nuclear
medium but not in the free space. It turns out that the resultant density
effect on the decay widths overwhelms that coming from the isospin asymmetry,
and the higher the $\rho$, the more enhanced the decay widths; the width for
the $\pi^{+}\pi^{-}\pi^0$ decay is enhanced with a factor two to three at the
normal density $\rho_0$ with a minor increase due to $\delta \rho$, while that

described by Dirac cones on the corners of Brillouin zone, but the physical
properties are richer than those of graphene since the spin degeneracy is
lifted and the optical selection rules are valley dependent. This has been
exploited for the optical injection of spin and valley polarized currents by
the application of static electric fields. In this paper we consider an
all-optical method for the injection of charge, spin and valley polarized
currents. The presence of both a fundamental optical field and its second
harmonic can lead to the injection of currents due to a nonlinear effect
involving the quantum interference between one- and two-photon absorption
processes. We analyze how the injected quantities can be controlled through the
parameters of the incident light fields, allowing capabilities of control
beyond those achieved with static fields, and discuss the conditions for
experimental verification of our results.

evidence of cosmic fields by investigating the parity-violating effects,
including parity nonconservation amplitudes and electric dipole moments, that
they induce in atoms. The results are used to constrain important fundamental
parameters describing the strength of the interaction of various cosmic fields
with electrons, protons, and neutrons. Candidates for such fields are dark
matter (including axions) and dark energy, as well as several more exotic
sources described by standard-model extensions. Existing parity nonconservation
experiments in Cs, Dy, Yb, and Tl are combined with our calculations to
directly place limits on the interaction strength between the temporal
component, b_0, of a static pseudovector cosmic field and the atomic electrons,
with the most stringent limit of |b_0^e| < 7*10^(-15) GeV, in the laboratory
frame of reference, coming from Dy. From a measurement of the nuclear anapole
moment of Cs, and a limit on its value for Tl, we also extract limits on the
interaction strength between the temporal component of this cosmic field, as
well as a related tensor cosmic-field component d_00, with protons and
neutrons. The most stringent limits of |b_0^p| < 4*10^(-8) GeV and |d_00^p| <
5*10^(-8) for protons, and |b_0^n| < 2*10^(-7) GeV and |d_00^n| < 2*10^(-7) for
neutrons (in the laboratory frame) come from the results using Cs. Axions may
induce oscillating P- and T-violating effects in atoms and molecules through
the generation of oscillating nuclear magnetic quadrupole and Schiff moments,
which arise from P- and T-odd intranuclear forces and from the electric dipole
moments of constituent nucleons. Nuclear-spin-independent parity
nonconservation effects may be enhanced in diatomic molecules possessing close
pairs of opposite-parity levels in the presence of time-dependent interactions.

this Letter, we address this problem by studying two widely used estimation
strategies: averaging measurement results, and maximum likelihood estimation,
respectively. For the first strategy, we find a surprising result that squeezed
coherent states of the pointer can give postselected weak measurements a higher
signal-to-noise ratio than standard ones while all standard coherent states
cannot, which suggests that raising the precision of weak measurements by
postselection calls for the presence of ""nonclassicality"" in the pointer
states. For the second strategy, we show that the quantum Fisher information of
postselected weak measurements is generally larger than that of standard weak
measurements, even without using the failed postselection events, but the gap
can be closed with a proper choice of system state.

successful paradigms in machine learning. In model-based methods, problem
domain knowledge can be built into the constraints of the model, typically at
the expense of difficulties during inference. In contrast, deterministic deep
neural networks are constructed in such a way that inference is
straightforward, but their architectures are generic and it is unclear how to
incorporate knowledge. This work aims to obtain the advantages of both
approaches. To do so, we start with a model-based approach and an associated
inference algorithm, and \emph{unfold} the inference iterations as layers in a
deep network. Rather than optimizing the original model, we \emph{untie} the

the inference algorithm. We then show its application to a non-negative matrix
factorization model that incorporates the problem-domain knowledge that sound
sources are additive. Deep unfolding of this model yields a new kind of
non-negative deep neural network, that can be trained using a multiplicative
backpropagation-style update algorithm. We present speech enhancement

Advanced
NMR experiments indicate that these conformational changes can occur in the
absence of ligand molecules (or with bound ligands), and that the ligands may
'select' protein conformations for binding (or unbinding). In this review, we
argue that this conformational selection requires transition times for ligand
binding and unbinding that are small compared to the dwell times of proteins in
different conformations, which is plausible for small ligand molecules. Such a
separation of timescales leads to a decoupling and temporal ordering of
binding/unbinding events and conformational changes. We propose that
conformational-selection and induced-change processes (such as induced fit) are
two sides of the same coin, because the temporal ordering is reversed in
binding and unbinding direction. Conformational-selection processes can be
characterized by a conformational excitation that occurs prior to a binding or
unbinding event, while induced-change processes exhibit a characteristic
conformational relaxation that occurs after a binding or unbinding event. We
discuss how the ordering of events can be determined from relaxation rates and
effective on- and off-rates determined in mixing experiments, and from the
conformational exchange rates measured in advanced NMR or single-molecule FRET
experiments. For larger ligand molecules such as peptides, conformational
changes and binding events can be intricately coupled and exhibit aspects of
conformational-selection and induced-change processes in both binding and
unbinding direction.

  Scheduling","28 pages,7 figures, submitted for possible journal publication",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper studies spatial capacity in a stochastic wireless ad hoc network,
where multi-stage probing and data transmission are sequentially performed. We
propose a novel signal-to-interference-ratio (SIR) threshold based scheduling
scheme, where by starting with the first probing, each transmitter iteratively
decides to further probe or stay idle, depending on whether the estimated SIR
in the proceeding probing is larger or smaller than a predefined threshold.
Although one can assume that the transmitters are initially deployed according
to a homogeneous Poisson point process (PPP), the SIR based scheduling makes
the PPP no longer applicable to model the locations of retained transmitters in
the subsequent probing and data transmission phases, due to the interference
induced coupling in their decisions. We first focus on single-stage probing and
find that when the SIR threshold is set sufficiently small to assure an
acceptable interference level in the network, the proposed scheme can greatly
outperform the non-scheduling reference scheme in terms of spatial capacity. We
clearly characterize the spatial capacity and obtain exact/approximate
closed-form expressions, by proposing a new approximate approach to deal with
the correlated SIR distributions over non-Poisson point processes. Then we
successfully extend to multi-stage probing by properly designing the multiple
SIR thresholds to assure gradual improvement of the spatial capacity.
Furthermore, we analyze the impact of multi-stage probing overhead and present
a probing-capacity tradeoff in scheduling design. Finally, extensive numerical
results are presented to demonstrate the performance of the proposed scheduling
as compared to existing schemes.

sellers connected by a platform (such as Amazon or eBay) that acts as an

optimal mechanism that maximizes the intermediary's profit in such a setting
may be quite complicated, the mechanisms observed in reality are generally much
simpler, e.g., applying an affine function to the price of the transaction as
the intermediary's fee. Loertscher and Niedermayer [2007] initiated the study
of such fee-setting mechanisms in two-sided markets, and we continue this
investigation by addressing the question of when an affine fee schedule is
approximately optimal for worst-case seller distribution. On one hand our work
supplies non-trivial sufficient conditions on the buyer side (i.e. linearity of
marginal revenue function, or MHR property of value and value minus cost
distributions) under which an affine fee schedule can obtain a constant
fraction of the intermediary's optimal profit for all seller distributions. On
the other hand we complement our result by showing that proper affine
fee-setting mechanisms (e.g. those used in eBay and Amazon selling plans) are
unable to extract a constant fraction of optimal profit in the worst-case
seller distribution. As subsidiary results we also show there exists a constant
gap between maximum surplus and maximum revenue under the aforementioned
conditions. Most of the mechanisms that we propose are also prior-independent
with respect to the seller, which signifies the practical implications of our
result.

afterglow and gravitational wave coincidence rate of 1 yr$^{-1}$ (0.1
yr$^{-1}$) for NS-NS (NS-BH), and how this rate is scaled down in detection
efficiency by the time it takes to image the gravitational wave sky
localization and the limiting magnitude of the telescopes. For NS-NS (NS-BH) we
find maximum detection efficiencies of $>80%$ when the total imaging time is
less than 200 min (80 min) and the limiting magnitude fainter than 20 (21). We
show that relatively small telescopes $(m<18)$ can achieve similar detection
efficiencies to meter class facilities $(m<20)$ with similar fields of view,
only if the less sensitive instruments can respond to the trigger and image the
field within 10-15 min. The inclusion of LIGO India into the gravitational wave
observatory network will significantly reduce imaging time for telescopes with
limiting magnitudes $\sim20$ but with modest fields of view. An optimal
coincidence search requires a global network of sensitive and fast response
wide field instruments that could effectively image relatively large

organizing principles for how these neurons work together remain unclear.
Information theory has offered explanations for how different types of neurons
can optimize the encoding of different stimulus features. However, recent
experiments indicate that separate neuronal types exist that encode the same
stimulus features, but do so with different thresholds. Here we show that the
emergence of these types of neurons can be quantitatively described by the
theory of transitions between different phases of matter. The two key
parameters that control the separation of neurons into subclasses are the mean
and standard deviation of noise levels among neurons in the population. The
mean noise level plays the role of temperature in the classic theory of phase
transitions, whereas the standard deviation is equivalent to pressure, in the
case of liquid-gas transitions, or to magnetic field for magnetic transitions.
Our results account for properties of two recently discovered types of
salamander OFF retinal ganglion cells, as well as the absence of multiple types
of ON cells. We further show that, across visual stimulus contrasts, retinal
circuits continued to operate near the critical point whose quantitative
characteristics matched those expected near a liquid-gas critical point and
described by the nearest-neighbor Ising model in three dimensions. By operating
near a critical point, neural circuits can optimize the trade-off between
maximizing information transmission in a given environment and quickly adapting

slab, bearing a quenched, random distribution of charges on one of its solution
interfaces, with a given mean and variance, both in the absence and in the
presence of a bathing monovalent salt solution. We use the previously derived
approach based on the dressed multivalent-ion theory that combines aspects of
the strong and weak coupling of multivalent and monovalent ions in a single
framework. The presence of quenched charge disorder on the charged surface of
the dielectric slab is shown to substantially increase the density of
multivalent counterions in its vicinity. In the counterion-only model (with no
monovalent salt ions), the surface disorder generates an additional logarithmic
attraction potential and thus an algebraically singular counterion density
profile at the surface. This behavior persists also in the presence of a
monovalent salt bath and results in significant violation of the contact-value
theorem, reflecting the anti-fragility effects of the disorder that drive the
system towards a more ordered state. In the presence of an interfacial
dielectric discontinuity, depleting the counterion layer at the surface, the
charge disorder still generates a much enhanced counterion density further away
from the surface. Likewise, the charge inversion and/or overcharging of the
surface occur more strongly and at smaller bulk concentrations of multivalent

that clusters with more high-mass stars lose relatively more mass through
stellar evolution, but the response to this mass loss is to expand and hence
significantly slow their dynamical evolution. We also argue that it is very
difficult, if not impossible, to have clusters with different IMFs that are
initially ""the same"", since the mass, radius and relaxation times depend on
each other and on the IMF in a complex way. We conclude that changing the IMF
to be biased towards more massive stars does speed up mass loss and
dissolution, but that it is not as dramatic as might be thought.

transport route for light species. The diffusion of chemical radicals from the
mantle to the outer surface are most effective. These species accumulate in the
mantle because of photodissociation by the cosmic-ray induced photons. The
faster diffusion of hydrogen within the warm ice enhances the hydrogenation of
radicals on pore surfaces. The overall result of the whole grain

vertical magnetic field for $\eta =1$. The Nusselt number $\mathrm{Nu}$ scales
with Rayleigh number $\mathrm{Ra}$ close to the primary instability as
$[\mathrm{\{Ra - Ra_c (Q)\}/Ra_c (Q)} ]^{0.91}$, where $\mathrm{Ra_c (Q)}$ is
the threshold for onset of stationary convection at a given value of the
Chandrasekhar number $\mathrm{Q}$. $\mathrm{Nu}$ also scales with
$\mathrm{Ra/Q}$ as $(\mathrm{Ra/Q})^{\mu}$. The exponent $\mu$ varies in the
range $0.39 \le \mu \le 0.57$ for $\mathrm{Ra/Q} \ge 25$. The primary
instability is stationary as predicted by Chandrasekhar. The secondary
instability is temporally periodic for $\mathrm{Pr}=0.1$ but quasiperiodic for
$\mathrm{Pr} = 0.025$ for moderate values of $\mathrm{Q}$. Convective patterns
for higher values of $\mathrm{Ra}$ consist of periodic, quasiperiodic and
chaotic wavy rolls above onset of the secondary instability for $\eta=1$. In
addition, stationary as well as time dependent cross-rolls are observed, as
$\mathrm{Ra}$ is further raised. The ratio $r_{\circ}/\mathrm{Pr}$ is
independent of $\mathrm{Q}$ for smaller values of $\mathrm{Q}$. The delay in
onset of the oscillatory instability is significantly reduced in a simulation

VDI discs that are continuously fed from the cosmic web. The density profile of
the spheroid is typically ""classical"", with a Sersic index $n = 4.5\pm 1$,
independent of whether it grew by mergers or VDI and independent of the
feedback strength. The disc is characterized by $n=1.5\pm 0.5$, and the whole

dissipative inflow of gas and the high universal density. The stellar surface
density within the effective radius of each galaxy as it evolves remains
roughly constant in time after its first growth. For galaxies of a fixed

the current and field distributions and the AC losses in a cable made of curved

considering spatial variation of the critical current density, which may be the
result of the manufacturing process. For example, rare-earth based coated
conductors are known to have a decrease of the transport properties in near the
edges of the tape: this influences the way current and field penetrate in the
sample and, consequently, the AC losses. We demonstrate that curved tapes
arranged on a cylindrical former behave as an infinite horizontal stack of
straight tapes, and we compare the AC losses in a variety of working
conditions, both without and with the lateral dependence of the critical
current density. This model and subsequent similar approaches can be of
interest for various applications of coated conductors, including power cables
and conductor-on-round-core (CORC) cables.

dynamo during structure formation might be able to explain the observed
magnetic fields in galaxy clusters. The magnetisation of more tenuous
large-scale structures such as cosmic filaments is more uncertain, as it is
challenging for numerical simulations to achieve the required dynamical range.
In this work, we present magneto-hydrodynamical cosmological simulations on
large uniform grids to study the amplification of primordial seed fields in the
intracluster medium (ICM) and in the warm-hot-intergalactic medium (WHIM). In
the ICM, we confirm that turbulence caused by structure formation can produce a
significant dynamo amplification, even if the amplification is smaller than
what is reported in other papers. In the WHIM inside filaments, we do not
observe significant dynamo amplification, even though we achieve Reynolds
numbers of $R_{\rm e} \sim 200-300$. The maximal amplification for large
filaments is of the order of $\sim 100$ for the magnetic energy, corresponding
to a typical field of a few $\sim \rm nG$ starting from a primordial weak field
of $10^{-10}$ G (comoving). In order to start a small-scale dynamo, we found
that a minimum of $\sim 10^2$ resolution elements across the virial radius of
galaxy clusters was necessary. In filaments we could not find a minimum
resolution to set off a dynamo. This stems from the inefficiency of supersonic
motions in the WHIM in triggering solenoidal modes and small-scale twisting of
magnetic field structures. Magnetic fields this small will make it hard to
detect filaments in radio observations.

understand the formation process of the emitted light. If the disk is optically
thick, scattering dominated and permeated by a Keplerian velocity field,
Non-Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium radiative transfer modeling must be done to
compute the emergent spectrum from a given disk model. We investigate Non-local
thermodynamic equilibrium polarized line formation in different simple disk
models and aim to demonstrate the importance of both radiative transfer effects
and scattering as well as the effects of velocity fields. We self-consistently
solve the coupled equations of radiative transfer and statistical equilibrium
for a two level atom model by means of Jacobi iteration. We compute scattering
polarization, that is Q/I and U/I line profiles. The degree of scattering
polarization is significantly influenced by the inclination of the disk with
respect to observer, but also by the optical thickness of the disk and the
presence of rotation. Stokes U shows double-lobed profiles with amplitude which
increases with the disk rotation. Our results suggest that the line profiles,
especially the polarized ones, emerging from gaseous disks differ significantly
from the profiles predicted by simple approximations. The profiles are diverse
in shape, but typically symmetric in Stokes Q and antisymmetric in Stokes U. A
clear indicator of disk rotation is the presence of Stokes U, which might prove
to be a useful diagnostic tool. We also demonstrate that, for moderate
rotational velocities, an approximate treatment can be used, where non-local
thermodynamic equilibrium radiative transfer is done in the velocity field-free
approximation and Doppler shift is applied in the process of spatial
integration over the whole emitting surface.

separation. In comparison, the phase behavior of colloids, nanoparticles or
proteins confined to interfaces, surfaces or membranes is significantly more
complex. Inclusions distort the local interface structure leading to
interactions that are fundamentally different from the well-studied
interactions mediated by isotropic solvents. Here, we investigate liquid-liquid
phase separation in monolayer membranes composed of dissimilar chiral colloidal
rods. We demonstrate that colloidal rafts are a ubiquitous feature of binary
colloidal membranes. We measure the raft free energy landscape by visualizing
its assembly kinetics. Subsequently, we quantify repulsive raft-raft
interactions and relate them to directly imaged raft-induced membrane
distortions, demonstrating that particle chirality plays a key role in this
microphase separation. At high densities, rafts assemble into cluster crystals
which constantly exchange monomeric rods with the background reservoir to
maintain a self-limited size. Lastly, we demonstrate that rafts can form bonds
to assemble into higher-order supra-structures. Our work demonstrates that
membrane-mediated liquid-liquid phase separation can be fundamentally different
from the well-characterized behavior of bulk liquids. It outlines a robust
membrane-based pathway for assembly of monodisperse liquid clusters which is
complementary to existing methods which take place in bulk suspensions.
Finally, it reveals that chiral inclusions in membranes acquire long-ranged
repulsive interactions, which might play a role in stabilizing assemblages of

presentation of Jerzy Neyman's Statistical Problems in Agricultural
Experimentation to the Royal Statistical Society. Neyman asserted that the
standard ANOVA F-test for randomized complete block designs is valid, whereas
the analogous test for Latin squares is invalid in the sense of detecting
differentiation among the treatments, when none existed on average, more often
than desired (i.e., having a higher Type I error than advertised). However,
Neyman's expressions for the expected mean residual sum of squares, for both
designs, are generally incorrect. Furthermore, Neyman's belief that the Type I
error (when testing the null hypothesis of zero average treatment effects) is
higher than desired, whenever the expected mean treatment sum of squares is
greater than the expected mean residual sum of squares, is generally incorrect.
Simple examples show that, without further assumptions on the potential
outcomes, one cannot determine the Type I error of the F-test from expected
sums of squares. Ultimately, we believe that the Neyman-Fisher controversy had
a deleterious impact on the development of statistics, with a major consequence
being that potential outcomes were ignored in favor of linear models and
classical statistical procedures that are imprecise without applied contexts.

uses conditional Bayes factors to compare models in a Metropolis-Hastings

observations $X_k\sim\mathcal{N}(\Theta_k,1)$ for $k=1,2,\ldots,N$, to estimate
the conditional distributions $\Theta_k|X_k$. There are two main estimation
strategies: modeling on the $\theta$ space, called ""$g$-modeling"" here, and
modeling on the $x$ space, called ""$f$-modeling."" The two approaches are
described and compared. A series of computational formulas are developed to
assess their frequentist accuracy. Several examples, both contrived and
genuine, show the strengths and limitations of the two strategies.

  quantitative estimates. This part gives a digested version of the regularity
  theory",,,,"math.AP math.PR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Since the seminal results by Avellaneda \& Lin it is known that elliptic
operators with periodic coefficients enjoy the same regularity theory as the
Laplacian on large scales. In a recent inspiring work, Armstrong \& Smart
proved large-scale Lipschitz estimates for such operators with random
coefficients satisfying a finite-range of dependence assumption. In the present
contribution, we extend the \emph{intrinsic large-scale} regularity of
Avellaneda \& Lin (namely, intrinsic large-scale Schauder and
Calder\'eron-Zygmund estimates) to elliptic systems with random coefficients.
The scale at which this improved regularity kicks in is characterized by a
stationary field $r_*$ which we call the minimal radius. This regularity theory
is \textit{qualitative} in the sense that $r_*$ is almost surely finite (which
yields a new Liouville theorem) under mere ergodicity, and it is
\textit{quantifiable} in the sense that $r_*$ has high stochastic integrability
provided the coefficients satisfy quantitative mixing assumptions. We
illustrate this by establishing \emph{optimal} moment bounds on $r_*$ for a
class of coefficient fields satisfying a multiscale functional inequality, and
in particular for Gaussian-type coefficient fields with arbitrary slow-decaying
correlations.

  Programming and Extensions","39 pages, 1 figure, 4 tables",,,,"math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper is devoted to the design of an efficient and convergent
{semi-proximal} alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) for finding
a solution of low to medium accuracy to convex quadratic conic programming and
related problems. For this class of problems, the convergent two block
semi-proximal ADMM can be employed to solve their primal form in a
straightforward way. However, it is known that it is more efficient to apply
the directly extended multi-block semi-proximal ADMM, though its convergence is
not guaranteed, to the dual form of these problems. Naturally, one may ask the
following question: can one construct a convergent multi-block semi-proximal
ADMM that is more efficient than the directly extended semi-proximal ADMM?
Indeed, for linear conic programming with 4-block constraints this has been
shown to be achievable in a recent paper by Sun, Toh and Yang [arXiv preprint
arXiv:1404.5378, (2014)]. Inspired by the aforementioned work and with the
convex quadratic conic programming in mind, we propose a Schur complement based
convergent semi-proximal ADMM for solving convex programming problems, with a
coupling linear equality constraint, whose objective function is the sum of two
proper closed convex functions plus an arbitrary number of convex quadratic or
linear functions. Our convergent semi-proximal ADMM is particularly suitable
for solving convex quadratic semidefinite programming (QSDP) with constraints
consisting of linear equalities, a positive semidefinite cone and a simple
convex polyhedral set. The efficiency of our proposed algorithm is demonstrated
by numerical experiments on various examples including QSDP.

well represented by a sum of two spectra: of a WR star of the WC8 type and of a

in the optical spectra of WR 48a and the near-by stars D2-3 and D2-7 (both
members of the open cluster Danks 2) indicates that WR 48a is located at a
distance of ~4 kpc from us. WR 48a is very likely a thermal radio source and
for such a case and smooth (no clumps) wind its radio emission suggests a
relatively high mass-loss rate of this dusty WR star (dM/dt = a few x 10^(-4)
solar masses per year). Long timescale (years) variability of WR 48a is
established in the optical, radio and X-rays. Colliding stellar winds likely
play a very important role in the physics of this object. However, some

a recent paper [Keitel et al 2014, PRD 89 064023], a Bayesian model selection

investigate the boundaries within which they are still safe to use, in
comparison with the F-statistic. Tests using synthetic draws show that the
optimally-tuned version of the original line-robust statistic remains safe in
most cases of practical interest. We also explore a simple idea on further
improving the detection power and safety of these statistics, which we however
find to be of limited practical use.

epistemic logic. The other one, the so called hyper logic, is more recent and
subsumes many proposals from the literature; it is based on explicit and
simultaneous quantification over multiple paths. In an attempt to better
understand how these logics compare with each other, we consider the logic
KCTL* (the extension of CTL* with knowledge modalities and synchronous perfect
recall semantics) and HyperCTL*. We first establish that KCTL* and HyperCTL*
are expressively incomparable. Second, we introduce and study a natural linear
past extension of HyperCTL* to unify KCTL* and HyperCTL*; indeed, we show that
KCTL* can be easily translated in linear time into the proposed logic.
Moreover, we show that the model-checking problem for this novel logic is
decidable, and we provide its exact computational complexity in terms of a new
measure of path quantifiers' alternation. For this, we settle open complexity
issues for unrestricted quantified propositional temporal logic.

A log-linear parameterization of an interaction model can be more expressive
than a direct parameterization based on probabilities, leading to a powerful
way of defining restrictions derived from marginal, conditional and
context-specific independence. However, parameter estimation is often simpler
under a direct parameterization, provided that the model enjoys certain
decomposability properties. Here we introduce a cyclical projection algorithm
for obtaining maximum likelihood estimates of log-linear parameters under an
arbitrary context-specific graphical log-linear model, which needs not satisfy
criteria of decomposability. We illustrate that lifting the restriction of
decomposability makes the models more expressive, such that additional
context-specific independencies embedded in real data can be identified. It is
also shown how a context-specific graphical model can correspond to a
non-hierarchical log-linear parameterization with a concise interpretation.
This observation can pave way to further development of non-hierarchical
log-linear models, which have been largely neglected due to their believed lack
of interpretability.

Differently from the traditional predictor feedback which is from the model
reduction appoint of view, the proposed PPF utilizes the idea of prediction by
generalizing the corresponding results for linear systems with a single input
delay to the case of multiple input delays. Since the PPF will generally lead
to distributed controllers, a truncated pseudopredictor feedback (TPPF)
approach is established instead which gives finite dimensional controllers. It
is shown that the TPPF can compensate arbitrarily large yet bounded delays as
long as the open-loop system is only polynomially unstable. The proposed TPPF
approach is then used to solve the consensus problems for multi-agent systems
characterized by linear systems with multiple input delays. Numerical examples
show the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

behavior in the intermediate regime. A new quantifier, the ratio of the amount
of solute in dominantly advective versus dominantly diffusive pore channels,
plays the role of `order parameter' of this phase transition. Taylor
dispersion, often invoked to explain the supra-linear behavior of longitudinal

with hydrodynamic turbulence, where the universal structure of the inertial and

arguments due to the presence of an intrinsic velocity scale -- the Alfven
velocity. In this Letter, we demonstrate that the Kolmogorov first
self-similarity hypothesis cannot be formulated for MHD turbulence in the same
way it is formulated for the hydrodynamic case. Besides profound consequences
for the analytical consideration, this also imposes stringent conditions on
numerical studies of MHD turbulence. In contrast with the hydrodynamic case,
the discretization scale in numerical simulations of MHD turbulence should
decrease faster than the dissipation scale, in order for the simulations to
remain resolved as the Reynolds number increases.

the chemical potential at fixed temperature, we use density functional theory
(DFT) to calculate chi(z) for a model fluid, close to bulk liquid-gas
coexistence, at various planar substrates. These range from a `neutral'
substrate with a contact angle of approximately 90 degrees, which favours
neither the liquid nor the gas phase, to a very solvophobic, purely repulsive
substrate which exhibits complete drying (i.e. contact angle 180 degrees). We
find that the maximum in the local compressibility, which occurs within one-two
molecular diameters of the substrate, and the integrated quantity chi_ex (the
surface excess compressibility, defined below) both increase rapidly as the
contact angle increases and the substrate becomes more solvophobic. The local
compressibility provides a more pronounced indicator of solvophobicity than the
density depletion in the vicinity of the surface which increases only weakly
with increasing contact angle. When the fluid is confined in a parallel slit
with two identical solvophobic walls, or with competing solvophobic and
solvophilic walls, chi(z) close to the solvophobic wall is altered little from
that at the single substrate. We connect our results with simulation studies of
water near to hydrophobic surfaces exploring the relationship between chi(z)

the loci of the CMD positions for the late-F- and G-type pre-main-sequence BPMG

extended to form a $\beta$-expansion of $x$. In this paper we study how good an
approximation is provided by the set of $n$-prefixes.
  Given $\Psi:\mathbb{N}\to\mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}$, we introduce the following
subset of $\mathbb{R}$,
$$W_{\beta}(\Psi):=\bigcap_{m=1}^{\infty}\bigcup_{n=m}^\infty\bigcup_{(\epsilon_{i})_{i=1}^{n}\in\{0,1\}^{n}}\Big[\sum_{i=1}^{n}\frac{\epsilon_i}{\beta^{i}},

$\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}2^{n}\Psi(n)<\infty$ the Borel-Cantelli lemma tells us that
the Lebesgue measure of $W_{\beta}(\Psi)$ is zero. When
$\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}2^{n}\Psi(n)=\infty,$ determining the Lebesgue measure of
$W_{\beta}(\Psi)$ is less straightforward. Our main result is that whenever
$\beta$ is a Garsia number and $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}2^{n}\Psi(n)=\infty$ then
$W_{\beta}(\Psi)$ is a set of full measure within $[0,\frac{1}{\beta-1}]$. Our
approach makes no assumptions on the monotonicity of $\Psi,$ unlike in
classical Diophantine approximation where it is often necessary to assume
$\Psi$ is decreasing.

Most of the previously observed molecular lines cover the frequency range

in order to have a more complete understanding of the chemistry and excitation
conditions of the region. We mapped a region of 2.5' x 2.5' centered at N113

with an angular and spectral resolution of 22"" and 0.11 km/s, respectively. In

we estimate LTE and virial masses of about 1x10^4 and 4.5x10^4 M_sun,
respectively. Additionally, from the dust continuum emission at 500 micron we
obtain a mass of gas of 7x10^3 M_sun. Towards the cloud center we detected
emission from: 12CO, 13CO, C18O (3-2), HCN, HNC, HCO+, C2H (4-3), and CS (7-6);
being the first reported detection of HCN, HNC, and C2H (4-3) lines from this
region. The CS (7-6) which was previously tentatively detected is confirmed in
this study. By analyzing the HCN, HNC, and C2H, we suggest that their emission
may arise from a photodissociation region (PDR). Moreover, we suggest that the
chemistry involving the C2H in N113 can be similar to that in Galactic PDRs.
Using the HCN J=4-3, J=3-2, and J=1-0 lines in a RADEX analysis we conclude
that we are observing very high density gas, between some 10^5 and 10^7 cm-3.

supplemented with a method to compute the maximum circular velocity, Vmax, of

tightly correlated, and that growth of the central potential precedes the
assembly of mass; the maximum circular velocity is already half the present day
value by the time the halo has accreted only 2 percent of its final mass.
Finally, we demonstrate that MAHs have a universal form, which we use to

a diffusion process pertaining to a chain of distributed control systems, with
random perturbations, exits from a given bounded open domain. In particular, we
consider a chain of distributed control systems that are formed by $n$
subsystems (with $n \ge 2$), where the random perturbation enters only in the
first subsystem and is then subsequently transmitted to the other subsystems.
Furthermore, we assume that, for any $\ell \in \{2, \ldots, n\}$, the
distributed control systems, which is formed by the first $\ell$ subsystems,
satisfies an appropriate H\""ormander condition. As a result of this, the
diffusion process is degenerate, in the sense that the infinitesimal generator
associated with it is a degenerate parabolic equation. Our interest is to
establish a connection between the minimum exit rate with which the diffusion
process exits from the given domain and the principal eigenvalue for the
infinitesimal generator with zero boundary conditions. Such a connection allows
us to derive a family of Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equations for which we provide
a verification theorem that shows the validity of the corresponding optimal
control problems. Finally, we provide an estimate on the attainable exit
probability of the diffusion process with respect to a set of admissible

is dictated by that of RBCs. We employ vesicles, which consist of closed
bilayer membranes enclosing a fluid, as a model system to study the behavior of
RBCs under a confined Poiseuille flow. We extensively explore two main
parameters: i) the degree of confinement of vesicles within the channel, and
ii) the flow strength. Rich and complex dynamics for vesicles are revealed
ranging from steady-state shapes (in the form of parachute and slipper) to
chaotic dynamics of shape. Chaos occurs through a cascade of multiple periodic
oscillations of the vesicle shape. We summarize our results in a phase diagram
in the parameter plane (degree of confinement, flow strength). This finding
highlights the level of complexity of a flowing vesicle in the small Reynolds
number where the flow is laminar in the absence of vesicles and can be rendered
turbulent due to elasticity of vesicles.

macroscopic variables by means of the Chapman-Enskog expansion, and we prove
that it yields the Navier-Stokes equation and is first order accurate in terms

(ii) is essentially local, in the sense that a radius- and

We reconsider the results of Pinsonneault & Stanek (2006), who argue that a
large proportion of binary stars have nearly equal-mass components; we find
that their data imply a relatively small number of such 'twins.' We argue that
samples of double-lined spectroscopic binaries are biased towards systems with

binaries of Pinsonneault & Stanek (2006), and the lack of twins in their
evolved systems. After accounting for the bias, we find that their observed
mass ratios may be consistent with a variety of intrinsic distributions,
including either a flat distribution or a Salpeter distribution. We conclude
that the observed overabundance of twins in Pinsonneault & Stanek (2006) does
not reflect the true population of binaries, and we briefly discuss the

projecting into two dimensions the motion of vibrofluidized granular matter in

coefficient that accounts for the energy dissipation, there is a separation
velocity that is added in each collision in the normal direction. The two
mechanisms balance on average, producing stationary homogeneous states.
Molecular dynamics simulations show that in the steady state the distribution
function departs from a Maxwellian, with cumulants that remain small in the
whole range of inelasticities. The shear viscosity normalized with stationary
temperature presents a clear dependence with the inelasticity, taking smaller
values compared to the elastic case. A Boltzmann-like equation is built and
analyzed using linear response theory. It is found that the predictions show an
excellent agreement with the simulations when the correct stationary

outflows from low-mass stars resembles the H$_2$ emission. It is still unclear
which of the different excitation components that characterise the mid- and
near-IR H$_2$ distribution is associated with H$_2$O. Aim: The aim is to
spectrally resolve the different excitation components observed in the H$_2$
emission. This will allow us to identify the H$_2$ counterpart associated with
H$_2$O and finally derive directly an H$_2$O abundance estimate with respect to
H$_2$. Methods: We present new high spectral resolution observations of H$_2$
0-0 S(4), 0-0 S(9), and 1-0 S(1) towards HH 54, a bright nearby shock region in
the southern sky. In addition, new Herschel-HIFI H$_2$O (2$_{12}$$-$1$_{01}$)
observations at 1670~GHz are presented. Results: Our observations show for the
first time a clear separation in velocity of the different H$_2$ lines: the 0-0
S(4) line at the lowest excitation peaks at $-$7~km~s$^{-1}$, while the more
excited 0-0 S(9) and 1-0 S(1) lines peak at $-$15~km~s$^{-1}$. H$_2$O and
high-$J$ CO appear to be associated with the H$_2$ 0-0 S(4) emission, which
traces a gas component with a temperature of 700$-$1000 K. The H$_2$O abundance
with respect to H$_2$ 0-0 S(4) is estimated to be
$X$(H$_2$O)$<$1.4$\times$10$^{-5}$ in the shocked gas over an area of
13$^{\prime\prime}$. Conclusions: We resolve two distinct gas components
associated with the HH 54 shock region at different velocities and excitations.
This allows us to constrain the temperature of the H$_2$O emitting gas
($\leq$1000 K) and to derive correct estimates of H$_2$O abundance in the
shocked gas, which is lower than what is expected from shock model predictions.

computation. We show that critical points of the energy are centroidal power
diagrams, which are generalizations of centroidal Voronoi tessellations, and
that they can be approximated by a generalization of Lloyd's algorithm (Lloyd's
algorithm is a common method for finding centroidal Voronoi tessellations). We
prove that the algorithm is energy decreasing and prove a convergence theorem.
Numerical experiments suggest that the algorithm converges linearly. We
illustrate the algorithm in two and three dimensions using simple models of
optimal location and crystallization. In particular, we test a conjecture about
the optimality of the BCC lattice for a simplified model of block copolymers.

research on research itself, an important role in the measurement of the impact
of research on other parts of society is ascribed to altmetrics. The present
case study investigates the usefulness of altmetrics for measuring the broader
impact of research. Methods: This case study is essentially based on a dataset
with papers obtained from F1000. The dataset was augmented with altmetrics
(such as Twitter counts) which were provided by PLOS (the Public Library of
Science). In total, the case study covers a total of 1,082 papers. Findings:
The F1000 dataset contains tags on papers which were assigned intellectually by
experts and which can characterise a paper. The most interesting tag for
altmetric research is ""good for teaching"". This tag is assigned to papers which
could be of interest to a wider circle of readers than the peers in a
specialist area. Particularly on Facebook and Twitter, one could expect papers
with this tag to be mentioned more often than those without this tag. With
respect to the ""good for teaching"" tag, the results from regression models were
able to confirm these expectations: Papers with this tag show significantly
higher Facebook and Twitter counts than papers without this tag. This
association could not be seen with Mendeley or Figshare counts (that is with
counts from platforms which are chiefly of interest in a scientific context).
Conclusions: The results of the current study indicate that Facebook and
Twitter, but not Figshare or Mendeley, can provide indications of papers which
are of interest to a broader circle of readers (and not only for the peers in a
specialist area), and seem therefore be useful for societal impact measurement.

future. By studying the equation of state parameter, we see that the phantom
divide may be crossed. Using the latest observational data, we calculate the
best values of the parameters for interacting HDE in BD framework. Computing
the deceleration parameter implies that the transition from deceleration to the
acceleration phase occurred for redshift $z\geq 0.5$. Finally, we investigate
the sound stability of the model, and find that HDE with GO cutoff in the
framework of BD cosmology can lead to a stable DE-dominated universe favored by
observations, provided we take $\beta=0.44$ and $b^2<0.35$. This is in contrast

idea, we investigate inflation in the framework of $q$-de Sitter. We consider
three types of scenarios for inflation. In a single inflation scenario, we

$\phi_{end}$, the spectral index and the associated running of the spectral
index are %$ n_\mathrm{s} - 1 \sim -2\epsilon, \quad \alpha_\mathrm{s} \equiv 0

inflation ends when the evolution of the scale factor is $a (t) =e_ {3/4} (t)

alternative to have inflation with ending point, We will study q-inflation

tries to clarify the origins and ideas behind the various versions, each of
which is valuable in the appropriate context. R has also been strongly
influenced by the ideas of functional programming and, in particular, by the
desire to combine functional with object oriented programming. To clarify how
this particular mix of ideas has turned out in the current R language and
supporting software, the paper will first review the basic ideas behind
object-oriented and functional programming, and then examine the evolution of R
with these ideas providing context. Functional programming supports
well-defined, defensible software giving reproducible results. Object-oriented
programming is the mechanism par excellence for managing complexity while
keeping things simple for the user. The two paradigms have been valuable in
supporting major software for fitting models to data and numerous other
statistical applications. The paradigms have been adopted, and adapted,
distinctively in R. Functional programming motivates much of R but R does not
enforce the paradigm. Object-oriented programming from a functional perspective
differs from that used in non-functional languages, a distinction that needs to
be emphasized to avoid confusion. R initially replicated the S language from
Bell Labs, which in turn was strongly influenced by earlier program libraries.
At each stage, new ideas have been added, but the previous software continues
to show its influence in the design as well. Outlining the evolution will
further clarify why we currently have this somewhat unusual combination of
ideas.

chain tethered to a planar substrate and thus affects the adsorption transition
as well as the coil-globule and crystallization transitions. Conversely,
solvent quality and surface attraction are reflected in equilibrium
force-extension curves that can be measured in experiments. To investigate
these effects theoretically, we study tethered chains under tension with
Wang-Landau simulations of a bond-fluctuation lattice model. Applying our model
to pulling experiments on biological molecules we obtain a good description of
experimental data in the intermediate force range, where universal features
dominate and finite size effects are small. For tethered chains in poor
solvent, we observe the predicted two-phase coexistence at transitions from the
globule to stretched conformations and also discover direct transitions from
crystalline to stretched conformations. A phase portrait for finite chains
constructed by evaluating the density of states for a broad range of solvent
conditions and tensions shows how increasing tension leads to a disappearance
of the globular phase. For chains in good solvents tethered to hard and
attractive surfaces we find the predicted scaling with the chain length in the
low-force regime and show that our results are well described by an analytical,
independent-bond approximation for the bond-fluctuation model for the highest
tensions. Finally, for a hard or slightly attractive surface the stretching of
a tethered chain is a conformational change that does not correspond to a phase
transition. However, when the surface attraction is sufficient to adsorb a
chain it will undergo a desorption transition at a critical value of the
applied force. Our results for force-induced desorption show the transition to
be discontinuous with partially desorbed conformations in the coexistence
region.

one-dimensional double-periodic lattices. In the limit of weak static field the
spectrum is shown to be a superposition of two Wannier-Stark ladders originated
from two Bloch subbands. As the strength of the field is increased, the
spectrum rearranges itself into a single Wannier-Stark ladder. We derive
analytical expressions which describe the rearrangement employing the analogy
between the Wannier-Stark problem and the driven two-level system in the
strong-coupling regime.

CPT-even Lorentz-violating term. In principle, the model could be a low-energy
limit of a Lorentz-invariant theory presenting the violation of Lorentz
symmetry as a consequence of a spontaneous symmetry-breaking mechanism if a
decoupling between the metric and the Nambu-Goldstone modes is assumed. We have
set up a convenient operator basis for the expansion of wave operators for
symmetric second-rank tensors in the presence of a background vector. By using
this set of operators, the particle content is obtained, and its consistency,
regarding the conditions for stability and unitarity, is discussed. We conclude
that this extra Lorentz noninvariant contribution is unable to address the
problems of stability and unitarity of higher-derivative gravity models.

is the management of the data pipeline, which controls transformations from
data to plot. The user's interactions needs to be propagated through these
modules and reflected in the output representation at a fast pace. Each
individual module may be easy to develop and manage, but the dependency
structure can be quite challenging. The MVC (Model/View/Controller) pattern is
an attempt to solve the problem by separating the user's interaction from the
representation of the data. In this paper we discuss the paradigm of reactive
programming in the framework of the MVC architecture and show its applicability
to interactive graphics. Under this paradigm, developers benefit from the
separation of user interaction from the graphical representation, which makes
it easier for users and developers to extend interactive applications. We show
the central role of reactive data objects in an interactive graphics system,
implemented as the R package cranvas, which is freely available on GitHub and
the main developers include the authors of this paper.
