simulations of known hadronic sources and semi-leptonic charmed decays. The
enhancement (excess yield) prominent in the Low-Mass Region (LMR) over the

find that the model consistently describes this enhancement from SPS up to top

promises to improve our understanding of the LMR enhancement's trend with total

secondary user (SU) in underlay cognitive radio networks. We consider a basic
yet illustrative scenario in which the primary user (PU) always transmit proper
Gaussian signals and has a minimum rate constraint. After parameterizing the SU
transmit signal in terms of its power and circularity coefficient (which
measures the degree of impropriety), we prove that the SU improves its rate by
transmitting improper signals only when the ratio of the squared modulus
between the SU-PU interference link and the SU direct link exceeds a given

coefficient that must be used by the SU depending on its power budget. Some
simulation results show that the SU benefits from the transmission of improper

optimization problems are crucial for the effectiveness of local search

Such local search algorithms typically return a set of mutually nondominated
Pareto local optimal (PLO) solutions, that is, a PLO-set. This paper
investigates two aspects of PLO-sets by means of experiments with Pareto local
search (PLS). First, we examine the impact of several problem characteristics
on the properties of PLO-sets for multi-objective NK-landscapes with correlated
objectives. In particular, we report that either increasing the number of
objectives or decreasing the correlation between objectives leads to an
exponential increment on the size of PLO-sets, whereas the variable correlation
has only a minor effect. Second, we study the running time and the quality
reached when using bounding archiving methods to limit the size of the archive
handled by PLS, and thus, the maximum size of the PLO-set found. We argue that
there is a clear relationship between the running time of PLS and the
difficulty of a problem instance.

sequences, can produce incorrect results when used on more divergent but
functionally related sequences that have undergone the sequence rearrangements
observed in many bacterial and viral genomes. Here, we propose a classification
model that exploits the complementary nature of alignment-based and
alignment-free similarity measures with the aim to improve the accuracy with
which DNA and protein sequences are characterized. Our model classifies
sequences using a combined sequence similarity score calculated by adaptively
weighting the contribution of different sequence similarity measures. Weights
are determined independently for each sequence in the test set and reflect the
discriminatory ability of individual similarity measures in the training set.
Since the similarity between some sequences is determined more accurately with
one type of measure rather than another, our classifier allows different sets
of weights to be associated with different sequences. Using five different
similarity measures we show that our model significantly improves the
classification accuracy over the current composition and alignment based
models, when predicting the taxonomic lineage for both short viral sequence
fragments and complete viral sequences. We also show that our model can be used
effectively for the classification of reads from a real metagenome dataset as
well as protein sequences.

Wick renormalised equation is well-posed. In the regime $\beta^2 \in (0,4\pi)$,
the Da Prato-Debussche method applies, while for $\beta^2 \in

naturally from a class of $2+1$-dimensional equilibrium interface fluctuation
models with periodic nonlinearities.
  The main mathematical difficulty arises in the construction of the model for
the associated regularity structure where the role of the noise is played by a
non-Gaussian random distribution similar to the complex multiplicative Gaussian
chaos recently analysed by Lacoin, Rhodes and Vargas (2013).

development of high-performance photodetectors. Graphene-based photodetectors
have been demonstrated to date using monolayer graphene operating in
conjunction with either metals or semiconductors. Most graphene devices are
fabricated on doped Si substrates with SiO2 dielectric used for back gating.
Here, we demonstrate photodetection in graphene field effect phototransistors
fabricated on undoped semiconductor (SiC) substrates. The photodetection
mechanism relies on the high sensitivity of the graphene conductivity to the
local change of the electric field that can result from the photo-excited
charge carriers produced in the back-gated semiconductor substrate. We also
modeled the device and simulated its operation using the finite element method
to validate the existence of the field induced photoresponse mechanism and
study its properties. Our graphene phototransistor possesses a room-temperature
photoresponsivity as high as ~ 7.4 A/W, higher than the required
photoresponsivity (1 A/W) in most practical applications. The light
power-dependent photocurrent and photoresponsivity can be tuned by the
source-drain bias voltage and back-gate voltage. Graphene phototransistors
based on this simple and generic architecture can be fabricated by depositing
graphene on a variety of undoped substrates, and are attractive for many
applications in which photodetection or radiation detection is sought.

electroweak precision data and in particular constraints on the $\rho$
parameter. Either a global $SU(2)_L \otimes SU(2)_R$ symmetry has to be imposed
on the scalar potential at the electroweak scale, as done in the well-known
Georgi-Machacek (GM) model, or the triplet vacuum expectation values must be
very small. We construct a supersymmetric model that can satisfy constraints on
the $\rho$ parameter, even if these two conditions are not fulfilled. We
supersymmetrize the GM model by imposing the $SU(2)_L \otimes SU(2)_R$ symmetry
at a scale $\mathcal M$, which we argue should be at or above the messenger
scale, where supersymmetry breaking is transmitted to the observable sector. We
show that scales $\mathcal M$ well above 100 TeV and sizable contributions from
the triplets to electroweak symmetry breaking can be comfortably accommodated.
We discuss the main phenomenological properties of the model and demonstrate
that the departure from custodial symmetry at the electroweak scale, due to

relation for the Higgs couplings to $WW$ and $ZZ$. As a by-product of
supersymmetry, we also show that one can easily obtain both large tree-level
\emph{and} one loop corrections to the Higgs mass. This allows for stops that
can be significantly lighter and with smaller mixing than those needed in the

present in measurements of the polarization of the cosmic microwave background
(CMB) at frequencies above 100GHz. We exploit the Planck HFI polarization data
from 100 to 353GHz to measure the dust angular power spectra $C_\ell^{EE,BB}$
over the range $40<\ell<600$ well away from the Galactic plane. These will
bring new insights into interstellar dust physics and a precise determination
of the level of contamination for CMB polarization experiments. We show that
statistical properties of the emission can be characterized over large
fractions of the sky using $C_\ell$. For the dust, they are well described by
power laws in $\ell$ with exponents $\alpha^{EE,BB}=-2.42\pm0.02$. The
amplitudes of the polarization $C_\ell$ vary with the average brightness in a
way similar to the intensity ones. The dust polarization frequency dependence
is consistent with modified blackbody emission with $\beta_d=1.59$ and
$T_d=19.6$K. We find a systematic ratio between the amplitudes of the Galactic
$B$- and $E$-modes of 0.5. We show that even in the faintest dust-emitting
regions there are no ""clean"" windows where primordial CMB $B$-mode polarization
could be measured without subtraction of dust emission. Finally, we investigate
the level of dust polarization in the BICEP2 experiment field. Extrapolation of
the Planck 353GHz data to 150GHz gives a dust power
$\ell(\ell+1)C_\ell^{BB}/(2\pi)$ of $1.32\times10^{-2}\mu$K$_{CMB}^2$ over the
$40<\ell<120$ range; the statistical uncertainty is $\pm0.29$ and there is an
additional uncertainty (+0.28,-0.24) from the extrapolation, both in the same
units. This is the same magnitude as reported by BICEP2 over this $\ell$ range,
which highlights the need for assessment of the polarized dust signal even in
the cleanest windows of the sky.

  and discussions about systematics",,,,"astro-ph.EP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Future radial velocity, astrometric, and direct-imaging surveys will find
nearby Earth-sized planets within the habitable zone in the near future. How
can we search for water and oxygen in those nontransiting planets? We show that
a combination of high-dispersion spectroscopic and coronagraphic techniques is
a promising technique to detect molecular lines imprinted in the scattered
light of Earth-like planets (ELPs). In this method, the planetary signals are
spectroscopically separated from telluric absorption by using the Doppler
shift. Assuming a long observing campaign (a 10-day exposure) using a
high-dispersion spectrometer (R=50,000) with speckle suppression on a 30-m
telescope, we simulate the spectra from ELPs around M dwarfs (whose stellar
effective temperature is 2750-3750 K) at 5 pc. Performing a cross-correlation
analysis with the spectral template of the molecular lines, we find that raw
contrasts of $10^{-4}$ and $10^{-5}$ (using Y, J, and H bands) are required to
detect water vapor at the 3 $\sigma$ and 16 $\sigma$ levels, respectively, for
$T_\star$=3000 K. The raw contrast of $10^{-5}$ is required for a 6 $\sigma$
detection of the oxygen 1.27 $\mu$m band. We also examine possible systematics,
incomplete speckle subtraction, and the correction for telluric lines. When
those are not perfect, a telluric water signal appears in the cross-correlation
function. However, we find the planetary signal is separated from that
resulting from the velocity difference. We also find that the intrinsic water
lines in the Phoenix spectra are too weak to affect the results for water
detection. We conclude that a combination of high-dispersion spectroscopy and
high-contrast instruments can be a powerful means to characterize ELPs in the
extremely large telescope era.

case study of pulmonary embolism diagnosis. The objective of the application of
neural hyper-network to pulmonary embolism (PE) is to improve diagnose for
reducing the number of CT-angiography needed. Hypernetworks, based on
topological simplicial complex, generalize the concept of two-relation to
many-body relation. Furthermore, Hypernetworks provide a significant
generalization of network theory, enabling the integration of relational
structure, logic and analytic dynamics. Another important results is that
Q-analysis stays close to the data, while other approaches manipulate data,
projecting them into metric spaces or applying some filtering functions to
highlight the intrinsic relations. A pulmonary embolism (PE) is a blockage of
the main artery of the lung or one of its branches, frequently fatal. Our study
uses data on 28 diagnostic features of 1,427 people considered to be at risk of
PE. The resulting neural hypernetwork correctly recognized 94% of those

and efficient, received signal's angle of arrival (AoA) estimation scheme. Our
intuitive, two-phases cross-correlation based scheme relies on a switched beam
antenna array, which is used to collect an omni-directional signal using few
elements of the antenna array in the first phase. In the second phase, the
scheme switches the main beam of the antenna array to scan the angular region
of interest. The collected signal from each beam (direction or angle) is cross
correlated with the omni-directional signal. The cross-correlation coefficient
will be the highest at the correct AoA and relatively negligible elsewhere. The
proposed scheme simplicity stems from its low computational complexity (only
cross-correlation and comparison operations are required) and its independence
of the transmitted signal structure (does not require information about the
transmitted signal). The proposed scheme requires a receiver with switched beam
antenna array, which can be attached to a single radio frequency chain through
phase shifters, hence, its hardware friendliness. The high efficiency of our
system can be observed by comparing its performance with the literature's best
performing MUSIC algorithm. The comparison demonstrates that our scheme
outperforms the MUSIC algorithm, specially at low SNR levels. Moreover, the
number of sources that can be detected using our scheme is bound by the number
of switched beams, rather than the number of antenna elements in the case of
the MUSIC algorithm.

understood. In this paper, we investigate the behavior of different scalarizing
functions and their parameters. We thereby abstract firstly from any specific

terms of the search ability of a (1+lambda)-EA on biobjective NK-landscapes.
Secondly, combining the outcomes of independent single-objective runs allows
for more general statements on set-based performance measures. Finally, we
investigate the correlation between the opening angle of the scalarizing
function's underlying contour lines and the position of the final solution in
the objective space. Our analysis is of fundamental nature and sheds more light
on the key characteristics of multiobjective scalarizing functions.

Bursts (FRB) impose coupled constraints that all models must satisfy. We show
that if the dispersion measures resulted from propagation through the
intergalactic medium at cosmological distances and the pulse widths were a
consequence of scattering by single thin screens, then the screens' electron
densities were $\gtrsim 20$/cm$^3$, $10^8$ times the mean intergalactic
density. This problem is resolved if the radiation scattered close to its
source, where high densities are possible. Observation of dispersion indices
close to their low density limit of $-2$ sets a model-independent upper bound
on the electron density and a lower bound on the size of the dispersive plasma
cloud, excluding terrestrial or Solar System origin. The scattering and much of
the dispersion measures may be attributed to scattering regions about 1 AU from
the sources, with electron densities $\sim 3 \times 10^8$/cm$^3$. The inferred
parameters are only marginally consistent; re-examination of the assumed
relation between dispersion measure and distance is warranted. Origin in an
ionized starburst or protogalaxy is suggested, but statistical arguments
exclude compact young SNR in the Galactic neighborhood. An appendix applies
these arguments to PSR J1745-2900 at the Galactic Center. We suggest that its
pulse width and angular broadening may be reconciled if we are near a caustic

at least, if the dark matter mass is about 800GeV or heavier, contributions of
events violating the unitarity are not negligible. The unitarity conditions in

explosions and have been evolved for at least 1.2 seconds after core bounce and
1 second after material first becomes unbound. Simulations were computed with
our Chimera code employing spectral neutrino transport, special and general
relativistic transport effects, and state-of-the-art neutrino interactions.
Continuing the evolution beyond 1 second allows explosions to develop more
fully and the processes powering the explosions to become more clearly evident.
We compute explosion energy estimates, including the binding energy of the
stellar envelope outside the shock, of 0.34, 0.88, 0.38, and 0.70 B ($10^{51}$

prolate shock morphologies, while the 20 $M_\odot$ model, though exhibiting
lobes and accretion streams like the other models, develops an approximately
spherical, off-center shock as the explosion begins and then becomes moderately
prolate $\sim$600 ms after bounce. This reduces the explosion energy relative
to the other models by reducing mass accretion during the critical explosion
power-up phase. We examine the growth of the explosion energy in our models

is detected in the radio with a flux density of S(4.8GHz) =0.22 +/- 0.04mJy -
one of relatively few known GRB hosts with a securely measured radio flux. Both
optical emission lines and a strong detection at 22 um suggest that the host
galaxy is forming stars rapidly, with an inferred star formation rate ~16
Msun/yr and a high dust obscuration (E(B-V )>1, based on sight-lines to the
nebular emission regions). The presence of a companion galaxy within a
projected distance of 25 kpc, and almost identical in redshift, suggests that
star formation may have been triggered by galaxy-galaxy interaction. However,
fitting of the remarkably flat spectral energy distribution from the
ultraviolet through to the infrared suggests that an older, 500Myr
post-starburst stellar population is present along with the ongoing star
formation. We suggest that that the host galaxy of GRB 080517 is a valuable

models of galaxy formation and evolution. Yet, determining the SFR (star
formation rate) of galaxies remains a challenge. Aims. In this paper we
investigate in isolation the impact of a variable star formation history on the
measurement of the SFR. Methods. We combine 23 state-of-the-art hydrodynamical
simulations of 1<z<2 galaxies on the main sequence with the cigale spectral
energy distribution modelling code. This allows us to generate synthetic
spectra every 1 Myr for each simulation, taking the stellar populations and the
nebular emission into account. Using these spectra, we estimate the SFR from
classical estimators which we compare with the true SFR we know from the
simulations. Results. We find that except for the Lyman continuum, classical
SFR estimators calibrated over 100 Myr overestimate the SFR from ~25% in the
FUV band to ~65% in the U band. Such biases are due 1) to the contribution of
stars living longer than 100 Myr, and 2) to variations of the SFR on timescales
longer than a few tens of Myr. Rapid variations of the SFR increase the
uncertainty on the determination of the instantaneous SFR but have no long term
effect. Conclusions. The discrepancies between the true and estimated SFR may
explain at least part of the tension between the integral of the star formation
rate density and the stellar mass density at a given redshift. To reduce
possible biases, we suggest to use SFR estimators calibrated over 1 Gyr rather
than the usually adopted 100 Myr timescales.

Calabi-Yaus with non-simplicial K\""ahler cones, but additional contributions

higher with respect to the low redshift (0.15<z<0.5) sample at any mass by
0.8+/-0.12 dex. A milder difference (0.35+/-0.1 dex) is observed between the

is declining more rapidly in the more massive halos than in the more common
lower mass halos. We do not observe any evolution in the halo occupation

star-forming galaxies ($\rm > 3 \times 10^{10}\,M_\odot$) up to z=4 in the
COSMOS field to determine if the intense star formation observed at high
redshift is induced by major mergers or caused by large gas reservoirs.
Firstly, we measured the evolution of the average spectral energy distributions
as a function of redshift using a stacking analysis of Spitzer, Herschel,
LABOCA, and AzTEC data for two samples of galaxies: normal star-forming objects
and strong starbursts, as defined by their distance to the main sequence. We
found that the mean intensity of the radiation field $< U >$ heating the dust
(strongly correlated with dust temperature) increases with increasing redshift
up to z$\sim$4 in main-sequence galaxies. We can reproduce this evolution with
simple models that account for the decrease of the gas metallicity with
redshift. No evolution of $< U >$ with redshift is found in strong starbursts.
We then deduced the evolution of the molecular gas fraction (defined here as
$\rm M_{\rm mol}/(M_{\rm mol}+M_\star)$) with redshift and found a similar,
steeply increasing trend for both samples. At z$\sim$4, this fraction reaches
$\sim$60%. The average position of the main-sequence galaxies is on the locus
of the local, normal star-forming disks in the integrated Schmidt-Kennicutt
diagram (star formation rate versus mass of molecular gas), suggesting that the
bulk of the star formation up to z=4 is dominated by secular processes.

aim, we use an improved version of the semi-analytical code GAlaxy MErger Tree
and Evolution (GAMETE), that reconstructs the hierarchical merger tree of the
MW, following the star formation history and the metal and dust evolution in
individual progenitors. The predicted scaling relations between the dust, metal

of local galaxies and of Gamma Ray Burst (GRB) host galaxies at 0.1 < z < 6.3.
We find that in order to reproduce the observed tail of the MDF at [Fe/H] < -4,
faint SN explosions have to dominate the metal yields produced by Pop III
stars, disfavoring a Pop III IMF that extends to stellar masses > 140 M_{sun},
into the Pair-Instability SN progenitor mass range. The relative contribution
of C-normal and C-enhanced stars to the MDF and its dependence on [Fe/H] points
to a scenario where the Pop III/II transition is driven by dust-cooling and the
first low-mass stars form when the dust-to-gas ratio in their parent clouds
exceeds a critical value of D_crit = 4.4 x 10^{-9}.

$CP$ violating axial coupling of the form $ (\alpha \, \sigma/f) F \tilde{F}$,
where $F_{\mu\nu}$ is the gauge field strength of a generic abelian $U(1)$
gauge group, not necessarily associated with the standard electromagnetism, and
$f$ is the decay constant of the axion. It has previously been demonstrated
that if the axion is identified with the inflaton, such an interaction can lead
to measurable cosmological signatures (non-Gaussian modifications of the
curvature perturbation spectrum) depending on the parameter $\xi= \alpha
\dot{\sigma}/ (f H)$. In the present paper we will show that the generation of
curvature perturbation at horizon crossing due to the axial coupling has a
universal form and remains unmodified in terms of the $\xi$ parameter even if
the axion, $\sigma$, is not identified with the inflaton. As a consequence, it
does not appear to be possible to generate CMB tensor perturbations through
this mechanism, larger than the vacuum ones, without violating the
observational constraints unless we combine this mechanism with a curvaton or
if the $\sigma$ field becomes heavy and decays during inflation. Even in this
last case there are non-trivial constraints coming from the slow-roll evolution
of the curvature perturbation on super horizon scales which should be taken
into account. We also comment on implications for inflationary models where
axions play an important role as, for example, models of natural inflation
where more than one axion are included and models where the curvaton is an
axion.

configuration-dependent bounds. This work explores theoretically some of the
revealing landmarks of such phenomenology, termed ""soft bound"". At long times,
the system reaches a steady state irreversibly (i.e., violating detailed

by a net local probability flux, which has entropic origin. The largest point
in the support of the distribution follows a saturating dynamics, expressed by
the Gompertz law, in line with empirical observations. Finally, we propose a
generic allometric scaling for the origin of soft bounds. These findings shed
light on the impact on a system of such ""scaling"" constraint and on its

the following conclusions. (1) High levels of r-process enhancement are found
in a broad range of stellar evolutionary states, reaffirming that this
phenomenon is not associated with a chemical peculiarity of red giant

velocity variations, reaffirming that stars with high levels of r-process

between high levels of r-process enhancement and high levels of C and N. (4)
The dispersions in [Sr/Ba] and [Sr/Eu] are larger than the dispersions in

corresponding two-body interaction decays with $r_{ij}$ as a power-law,

limits $\alpha=0$ and $\alpha\to\infty$, respectively. The dynamics of the
model is investigated for energies $U$ below its critical value ($U<U_{c}$),
with initial conditions corresponding to zero magnetization. The presence of
quasi-stationary states (QSSs), whose durations $t_{\rm QSS}$ increase for
increasing values of $N$, is verified for values of $\alpha$ in the range $0
\leq \alpha <1$, like the ones found for the similar model of XY rotators.
Moreover, for a given energy $U$, our numerical analysis indicates that $t_{\rm

that $\gamma \to 0$ as $\alpha \to 1$. The growth of $t_{\rm QSS}$ with $N$

occur for any value of $\alpha$ in this interval.

straightforward, by making use of various works of Nesterov.

mainly accelerated. The structure of the molecular emission has been modelled
with a 3D radiation transfer code. The emission of line SiS(v=0,J=14-13) is
best reproduced with a set of maser emitting arcs arranged between 5 and 20 R*.
The abundance of H13CN with respect to H2 decreases from 8e-7 at 1-5 R* to 3e-7

factor of 2 due North-East between 20 and 50 R*. SiC2 is formed at the stellar

prediction of multiple labels. This is typically done by maximizing a score
function on the space of labels, which decomposes as a sum of pairwise
elements, each depending on two specific labels. Intuitively, the more pairwise
terms are used, the better the expected accuracy. However, there is currently
no theoretical account of this intuition. This paper takes a significant step
in this direction.
  We formulate the problem as classifying the vertices of a known graph
$G=(V,E)$, where the vertices and edges of the graph are labelled and correlate
semi-randomly with the ground truth. We show that the prospects for achieving
low expected Hamming error depend on the structure of the graph $G$ in
interesting ways. For example, if $G$ is a very poor expander, like a path,
then large expected Hamming error is inevitable. Our main positive result shows
that, for a wide class of graphs including 2D grid graphs common in machine
vision applications, there is a polynomial-time algorithm with small and
information-theoretically near-optimal expected error. Our results provide a
first step toward a theoretical justification for the empirical success of the
efficient approximate inference algorithms that are used for structured

between vertices $u$ and $v$ at time $\tau$ if the $(u,v)$-entry of $U(\tau)$
has unit magnitude. This paper studies quantum walks relative to graph
Laplacians. Some main observations include the following closure properties for
perfect state transfer:
  (1) If a $n$-vertex graph has perfect state transfer at time $\tau$ relative
to the Laplacian, then so does its complement if $n\tau$ is an integer multiple
of $2\pi$. As a corollary, the double cone over any $m$-vertex graph has
perfect state transfer relative to the Laplacian if and only if $m \equiv 2
\pmod{4}$. This was previously known for a double cone over a clique (S. Bose,
A. Casaccino, S. Mancini, S. Severini, Int. J. Quant. Inf., 7:11, 2009).
  (2) If a graph $G$ has perfect state transfer at time $\tau$ relative to the
normalized Laplacian, then so does the weak product $G \times H$ if for any
normalized Laplacian eigenvalues $\lambda$ of $G$ and $\mu$ of $H$, we have
$\mu(\lambda-1)\tau$ is an integer multiple of $2\pi$. As a corollary, a weak
product of $P_{3}$ with an even clique or an odd cube has perfect state
transfer relative to the normalized Laplacian. It was known earlier that a weak
product of a circulant with odd integer eigenvalues and an even cube or a
Cartesian power of $P_{3}$ has perfect state transfer relative to the adjacency
matrix.
  As for negative results, no path with four vertices or more has antipodal
perfect state transfer relative to the normalized Laplacian. This almost
matches the state of affairs under the adjacency matrix (C. Godsil, Discrete
Math., 312:1, 2011).

shocks that propagate through a prespecified, kinematically defined turbulent
magnetic field. The turbulence consists of broadband magnetic fluctuations that
are embedded in the plasma and cover a range of wavelengths, the smallest of
which is larger than the gyroadii of electrons that are initially injected into
the system. We find that when the variance of the turbulent component of the
upstream magnetic field is sufficiently large -- $\sigma^2 \sim$ 10 $B_0^2$,
where $B_0$ is the strength of the background magnetic field -- electrons can
be efficiently accelerated at a collisionless shock regardless of the
orientation of the mean upstream magnetic field relative to the shock-normal
direction. Since the local angle between the incident magnetic-field vector and
the shock-normal vector can be quite large, electrons can be accelerated
through shock-drift acceleration at the shock front. In the upstream region,
electrons are mirrored back to the shock front leading to multiple shock
encounters. Eventually the accelerated electrons are energetic enough that
their gyroradii are of the same order as the wavelength of waves that are
included in our description of the turbulent magnetic field. Our results are
consistent with recent \textit{in situ} observations at Saturn's bow shock. The
study may help understand the acceleration of electrons at shocks in space and

concurrent development of high-efficiency and high-precision-timing light
sensors, has opened up the possibility for a new kind of large-scale detector
capable of a very broad program of physics. The program would include
determination of the neutrino mass hierarchy and observation of CP violation
with long-baseline neutrinos, searches for proton decay, ultra-precise solar
neutrino measurements, geo- and supernova neutrinos including diffuse supernova
antineutrinos, and neutrinoless double beta decay. We outline here the basic
requirements of the Advanced Scintillation Detector Concept (ASDC), which
combines the use of WbLS, doping with a number of potential isotopes for a
range of physics goals, high efficiency and ultra-fast timing photosensors, and
a deep underground location. We are considering such a detector at the Long
Baseline Neutrino Facility (LBNF) far site, where the ASDC could operate in
conjunction with the liquid argon tracking detector proposed by the LBNE
collaboration. The goal is the deployment of a 30-100 kiloton-scale detector,

wealth of new phases and broken symmetries, it is important to understand the
general constraints on the possibility of observing a finite Kerr effect. In
this paper we reviewed the consequences of reciprocity on the scattering of
electromagnetic waves. In particular we concentrate on the possible detection
of Kerr effect from chiral media with and without time-reversal symmetry
breaking. We show that a finite Kerr effect is possible only if reciprocity is
broken. Introducing the utilization of the Sagnac interferometer as a detector
for breakdown of reciprocity via the detection of a finite Kerr effect, we
argue that in the linear regime, a finite detection is possible only if
reciprocity is broken. We then discuss possible Kerr effect detection for
materials with natural optical activity, magnetism, and chiral
superconductivity.

using the density-matrix renormalization group method. To identify the ground
state, we take four kinds of clusters into account; periodic, cylindrical, and
two open ones. The hexagonal singlet solid (HSS) and triangular valence bond
solid (TVBS) states are artificially generated by modulating edge shapes of the
open clusters. We find that the energy par sites of the HSS state is $e_0=E_0/N
=-1.41095$, which is readily lower than that of the TVBS state ($e_0=-1.3912

and periodic ($e_0=-1.409 \pm 0.005$) clusters, where no assumption as to the
ordering is posed. Thus, we conclude that the HSS picture is consistent to
describe the ground state of the $S=1$ Kagome Heisenberg model. This is further
confirmed by finding non-symmetry-breaking state in the calculations of the
dimer-dimer correlation functions as well as the entanglement entropy of
cylindrical clusters. Finally, we estimate the single-triplet energy gap: The
HSS ground state has $\Delta=0.1919$, while the TVBS excited state has a larger
one $\Delta=0.2797$.

cells like the trafficking of ions between cells. Standard procedures to

either supported membranes or vesicles. Both techniques have several
shortcoming in terms of bio relevance or accessibility for measurements. In
this article the formation of individual free standing hemifused states between
model cell membranes is studied using an optimized microfluidic scheme which
allows for simultaneous optical and electrophysiological measurements. In a
first step, two model membranes are formed at a desired location within a
microfluidic device using a variation of the droplet interface bilayer (DiB)
technique. In a second step, the two model membranes are brought into contact
forming a single hemifused state. For all tested lipids, the hemifused state
between free standing membranes form within hundreds of milliseconds, i.e.
several orders of magnitude faster than reported in literature. The formation
of a hemifused state is observed as a two stage process, whereas the second
stage can be explained as a dewetting process in no-slip boundary condition.
The formed hemifusion states are long living and a single fusion event can be
observed when triggered by an applied electric field as demonstrated for
monoolein.

often requires a fictitious outer boundary. An important practical issue is the
specification of appropriate boundary conditions on this boundary, often
conditions of complete transparency. Attention to this issue has been paid
elsewhere, and here we consider a different, although related, issue: far-field
signal recovery. Namely, from smooth data recorded on the outer boundary we
wish to recover the far-field signal which would reach arbitrarily large
distances. These signals encode information about interior scatterers and often
correspond to actual measurements. This article expresses far-field signal
recovery in terms of time-domain convolutions, each between a solution
multipole moment recorded at the boundary and a sum-of-exponentials kernel.
Each exponential corresponds to a pole term in the Laplace transform of the
kernel, a finite sum of simple poles. Greengard, Hagstrom, and Jiang have
derived the large-$\ell$ (spherical-harmonic index) asymptotic expansion for
the pole residues, and their analysis shows that, when expressed in terms of
the exact sum-of-exponentials, large-$\ell$ signal recovery is plagued by
cancellation errors. Nevertheless, through an alternative integral
representation of the kernel and its subsequent approximation by a {\em
smaller} number of exponential terms (kernel compression), we are able to
alleviate these errors and achieve accurate signal recovery. We empirically
examine scaling relations between the parameters which determine a compressed
kernel, and perform numerical tests of signal ""teleportation"" from one radial
value $r_1$ to another $r_2$, including the case $r_2=\infty$. We conclude with
a brief discussion on application to other hyperbolic equations posed on
non-flat geometries where waves undergo backscatter.

splitting of existing blood vessels. During sprouting, a highly motile type of
endothelial cell, called the tip cell, migrates from the blood vessels followed
by stalk cells, an endothelial cell type that forms the body of the sprout. To
get more insight into how tip cells contribute to angiogenesis, we extended an
existing computational model of vascular network formation based on the
cellular Potts model with tip and stalk differentiation, without making a
priori assumptions about the differences between tip cells and stalk cells. To
predict potential differences, we looked for parameter values that make tip
cells (a) move to the sprout tip, and (b) change the morphology of the
angiogenic networks. The screening predicted that if tip cells respond less
effectively to an endothelial chemoattractant than stalk cells, they move to
the tips of the sprouts, which impacts the morphology of the networks. A
comparison of this model prediction with genes expressed differentially in tip
and stalk cells revealed that the endothelial chemoattractant Apelin and its
receptor APJ may match the model prediction. To test the model prediction we
inhibited Apelin signaling in our model and in an \emph{in vitro} model of
angiogenic sprouting, and found that in both cases inhibition of Apelin or of
its receptor APJ reduces sprouting. Based on the prediction of the
computational model, we propose that the differential expression of Apelin and
APJ yields a ""self-generated"" gradient mechanisms that accelerates the
extension of the sprout.

functions capturing many interesting cases including cut functions of graphs
and hypergraphs. Maximization of such functions subject to various constraints
receives little attention by current research, unlike similar minimization
problems which have been widely studied. In this work, we identify a few
submodular maximization problems for which one can get a better approximation
for symmetric objectives than the state of the art approximation for general
submodular functions.
  We first consider the problem of maximizing a non-negative symmetric
submodular function $f\colon 2^\mathcal{N} \to \mathbb{R}^+$ subject to a
down-monotone solvable polytope $\mathcal{P} \subseteq [0, 1]^\mathcal{N}$. For
this problem we describe an algorithm producing a fractional solution of value
at least $0.432 \cdot f(OPT)$, where $OPT$ is the optimal integral solution.
Our second result considers the problem $\max \{f(S) : |S| = k\}$ for a
non-negative symmetric submodular function $f\colon 2^\mathcal{N} \to
\mathbb{R}^+$. For this problem, we give an approximation ratio that depends on
the value $k / |\mathcal{N}|$ and is always at least $0.432$. Our method can
also be applied to non-negative non-symmetric submodular functions, in which
case it produces $1/e - o(1)$ approximation, improving over the best known
result for this problem. For unconstrained maximization of a non-negative
symmetric submodular function we describe a deterministic linear-time
$1/2$-approximation algorithm. Finally, we give a $[1 - (1 - 1/k)^{k -
1}]$-approximation algorithm for Submodular Welfare with $k$ players having
identical non-negative submodular utility functions, and show that this is the
best possible approximation ratio for the problem.

avoid straining grid resources by offering price incentives so that customers
accept being routed to less busy stations, (ii) maximize total revenue by
serving more customers with the same amount of grid resources, and (iii)
provide charging service to customers with a certain level of

and n-legs. The model considers all thermoelectric effects, temperature
dependent material parameters and simultaneous convective, conductive and
radiative heat losses, including surface to surface radiation. For radiative
heat losses it is shown that for the temperatures considered here, surface to
ambient radiation is a good approximation of the heat loss. For conductive heat
transfer the module efficiency is shown to be comparable to the case of
radiative losses. Finally, heat losses due to internal natural convection in
the module is shown to be negligible for the millimetre sized modules
considered here. The combined case of radiative and conductive heat transfer
resulted in the lowest efficiency. The optimized load resistance is found to
decrease for increased heat loss. The leg dimensions are varied for all heat
losses cases and it is shown that the ideal way to construct a TEG module with
minimal heat losses and maximum efficiency is to either use a good insulating
material between the legs or evacuate the module completely, and use small and
wide legs closely spaced.

with the dark matter and the Generalized Cosmic Chaplygin gas (GCCG) type dark
energy where dark matter follows the linear equation of state. We present the
Hubble parameter in terms of the observable parameters $\Omega_{m0}$ and
$H_{0}$ with the redshift $z$ and the other parameters like $A$, $B$, $w_{m}$,
$ \omega$ and $\alpha$ which coming from our model. From Stern data set (12
points)\& SNe Type Ia 292 data (from \cite{Riess1,Riess2,Astier}) we have
obtained the bounds of the arbitrary parameters by minimizing the $\chi^{2}$
test. The best-fit values of the parameters are obtained by 66\%, 90\% and 99\%
confidence levels. Next due to joint analysis with Stern+BAO and Stern+BAO+CMB
observations, we have also obtained the bounds of the parameters ($A,B$) by
fixing some other parameters $\alpha$, $w_{m}$ and $\omega$. From the best fit
values of the parameters, we have obtained the distance modulus $\mu(z)$ for
our theoretical GCCG model in LQC and from Supernovae Type Ia (union2 sample
552 data from [\cite{Amanullah}] \& Riess 292 data from
[\cite{Riess1,Riess2,Astier}]), we have concluded that our model is in
agreement with the Supernovae Type Ia sample data. In addition, we have
investigated in details about the various types of Future Singularities that
may be formed in this model and it is notable that our model is completely free
from any types of future singularities.

  Firstly we study the linear and non-linear BRST transformations for the ABJM
theory. Then we derive the finite field dependent version of these BRST
(FFBRST) transformations. Further we show that such FFBRST transformations
relate the generating functional in linear gauge to the generating functional
in the non-linear gauge of ABJM theory.
