success in image classification. The main difference among them is their
encoding schemes. For example, ScSPM incorporates Sparse Code (SC) instead of
Vector Quantization (VQ) into the framework of SPM. Although the methods
achieve a higher recognition rate than the traditional SPM, they consume more
time to encode the local descriptors extracted from the image. In this paper,
we propose using Low Rank Representation (LRR) to encode the descriptors under
the framework of SPM. Different from SC, LRR considers the group effect among
data points instead of sparsity. Benefiting from this property, the proposed
method (i.e., LrrSPM) can offer a better performance. To further improve the
generalizability and robustness, we reformulate the rank-minimization problem
as a truncated projection problem. Extensive experimental studies show that
LrrSPM is more efficient than its counterparts (e.g., ScSPM) while achieving
competitive recognition rates on nine image data sets.

presented. The predicted statistical equilibrium state is the most probable
outcome of turbulent stirring. The slow temporal evolution of the vertical
density profile is related to the presence of irreversible mixing, which alters
the global distribution of density levels. We propose a model in which the
vertical density profile evolves through a sequence of statistical equilibrium
states. The theory is then tested with laboratory experiments in a two-layer
stably stratified fluid forced from below by an oscillating grid. Quantitative
measurements of density fluctuations across the interface are made by planar
laser induced fluorescence. These fluctuations are splitted in a ""wave"" part
and a ""turbulent"" part. The wave part of the density field is well described by
a previous theory due to Phillips. We argue that statistical mechanics
predictions apply for the turbulent part of the density field sufficiently
close to the interface. However inside the mixed layer density fluctuations are
instead controlled by a balance between eddy flux downward and dissipation by
cascade to small scales. We report exponential tails for the density pdf in
this region.

instabilities. On the other hand, pure mean-field implementations do not apply
to situations where instabilities, bifurcations and chaos are present. The

with random covariates that allows for flexible clustering of a random vector
composed of response variables and covariates. In each mixture component, it
adopts a Gaussian distribution for both the covariates and the responses given
the covariates. To robustify the approach with respect to possible elliptical
heavy tailed departures from normality, due to the presence of atypical
observations, the contaminated Gaussian CWM is here introduced. In addition to
the parameters of the Gaussian CWM, each mixture component of our contaminated
CWM has a parameter controlling the proportion of outliers, one controlling the
proportion of leverage points, one specifying the degree of contamination with
respect to the response variables, and one specifying the degree of
contamination with respect to the covariates. Crucially, these parameters do
not have to be specified a priori, adding flexibility to our approach.
Furthermore, once the model is estimated and the observations are assigned to
the groups, a finer intra-group classification in typical points, outliers,
good leverage points, and bad leverage points - concepts of primary importance
in robust regression analysis - can be directly obtained. Relations with other
mixture-based contaminated models are analyzed, identifiability conditions are
provided, an expectation-conditional maximization algorithm is outlined for
parameter estimation, and various implementation and operational issues are
discussed. Properties of the estimators of the regression coefficients are
evaluated through Monte Carlo experiments and compared to the estimators from
the Gaussian CWM. A sensitivity study is also conducted based on a real data

range of application areas. Broadly speaking, a random $s$-intersection graph
is constructed by first assigning each vertex a set of items in some random
manner, and then putting an undirected edge between all pairs of vertices that
share at least $s$ items (the graph is called a random intersection graph when
$s=1$). A special case of particular interest is a uniform random
$s$-intersection graph, where each vertex independently selects the same number
of items uniformly at random from a common item pool. Another important case is
a binomial random $s$-intersection graph, where each item from a pool is
independently assigned to each vertex with the same probability. Both models
have found numerous applications thus far including cryptanalysis, and the
modeling of recommender systems, secure sensor networks, online social
networks, trust networks and small-world networks (uniform random
$s$-intersection graphs), as well as clustering analysis, classification, and
the design of integrated circuits (binomial random $s$-intersection graphs).

rigorously derive the asymptotically exact probability of $k$-connectivity in

strengthen their own predictions. A C++ source code listing of the model

permutation $\pi\in {\rm{Sym}_n}$ is a word (product of elements) of $S$. A
positive integer $d(\pi)$ is associated with each $\pi\in{\rm{Sym}_n}$ taking
the length of the shortest such word, and the $S$-diameter $d(S)$ is the
maximum value of $d(\pi)$ with $\pi$ ranging over ${\rm{Sym_n}}$. The distance
$d(\pi,\nu)$ of two permutations $\pi,\nu$ defined by $d(\nu^{-1}\circ\pi)$
satisfies the axioms of a metric space. In this paper we consider the case
where $S$ consists of all block transpositions of ${\rm{Sym_n}}$ and call
$d(\pi)$ the block transposition distance of $\pi$. A strong motivation for the
study of this special case comes from investigations of large-scale mutations
of genome, where determining $d(\pi)$ is known as sorting the permutation $\pi$
by block transpositions. In the papers on this subject, toric equivalence
classes often play a crucial role since $d(\pi)=d(\nu)$ when $\pi$ and $\nu$
are torically equivalent. A proof of this result can be found in the
(unpublished) Hausen's Ph.D Dissertation thesis; see \cite{Ha}. Our main
contribution is to obtain a bijective map on ${\rm{Sym}_n}$ from the toric
equivalence that leaves the distances invariant. Using the properties of this
map, we give an alternative proof of Hausen's result which actually fills a gap
in the proof of the upper bound on $d(S)$ due to Eriksson and his coworkers;
see \cite{EE}. We also revisit the proof of the key lemma \cite[Lemma 5,1]{EE},
giving more details and filling some gaps.

properties of nodes have been proposed to rank the importance of nodes. In
order to understand the correlations between centrality metrics and to
approximate a high-complexity centrality metric by a strongly correlated
low-complexity metric, we first study the correlation between centrality
metrics in terms of their Pearson correlation coefficient and their similarity
in ranking of nodes. In addition to considering the widely used centrality
metrics, we introduce a new centrality measure, the degree mass. The m order
degree mass of a node is the sum of the weighted degree of the node and its
neighbors no further than m hops away. We find that the B_{n}, the closeness,
and the components of x_{1} are strongly correlated with the degree, the
1st-order degree mass and the 2nd-order degree mass, respectively, in both
network models and real-world networks. We then theoretically prove that the
Pearson correlation coefficient between x_{1} and the 2nd-order degree mass is
larger than that between x_{1} and a lower order degree mass. Finally, we
investigate the effect of the inflexible antagonists selected based on
different centrality metrics in helping one opinion to compete with another in
the inflexible antagonists opinion model. Interestingly, we find that selecting
the inflexible antagonists based on the leverage, the B_{n}, or the degree is
more effective in opinion-competition than using other centrality metrics in
all types of networks. This observation is supported by our previous
observations, i.e., that there is a strong linear correlation between the
degree and the B_{n}, as well as a high centrality similarity between the
leverage and the degree.

is applied to traffic flow data from interstate highway I-55 in Chicago. We
provide a real-time data analysis of how to learn the drop in capacity as a

assess the uncertainty of the current traffic state at shock waves, where the
uncertainty is a mixture distribution. We show that Bayesian learning can
correct the estimation bias that is present in the model with fixed parameters.

electronic and transport properties of wurtzite aluminum nitride. Our
calculations utilized a local density approximation (LDA) potential and the
linear combination of Gaussian orbitals (LCGO). Unlike some other density
functional theory (DFT) calculations, we employed the Bagayoko, Zhao, and
Williams' method, enhanced by Ekuma and Franklin (BZW-EF). The BZW-EF method
verifiably leads to the minima of the occupied energies; these minima, the low
laying unoccupied energies, and related wave functions provide the most
variationally and physically valid density functional theory (DFT) description
of the ground states of materials under study. With multiple oxidation states
of Al (Al$^{3+}$ to Al) and the availability of N$^{3-}$ to N, the BZW-EF
method required several sets of self-consistent calculations with different
ionic species as input. The binding energy for (Al$^{+3}$ & N$^{3-}$) as input
was 1.5 eV larger in magnitude than those for other input choices; the results
discussed here are those from the calculation that led to the absolute minima
of the occupied energies with this input. Our calculated, direct band gap for
w-AlN, at the $\Gamma$ point, is 6.28 eV, in excellent agreement with the 6.28
eV experimental value at 5 K. We discuss the bands, total and partial densities
of states, and calculated, effective masses.

proposed to restrict the model definition on a subset of samples. The most
known criterion is the (linear) approximation criterion, which discards any
sample that can be well represented by the already contributing samples, an
operation with excessive computational complexity. Several computationally
efficient sparsification criteria have been introduced in the literature, such
as the distance, the coherence and the Babel criteria. In this paper, we
provide a framework that connects these sparsification criteria to the issue of
approximating samples, by deriving theoretical bounds on the approximation
errors. Moreover, we investigate the error of approximating any feature, by
proposing upper-bounds on the approximation error for each of the
aforementioned sparsification criteria. Two classes of features are described

  McKeon","A foundation for analytical developments in the logarithmic region of
  turbulent channels","Submitted to J. Fluid Mech",,,,"physics.flu-dyn","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  An analytical framework for studying the logarithmic region of turbulent
channels is formulated. We build on recent findings (Moarref et al., J. Fluid
Mech., 734, 2013) that the velocity fluctuations in the logarithmic region can
be decomposed into a weighted sum of geometrically self-similar resolvent
modes. The resolvent modes and the weights represent the linear amplification
mechanisms and the scaling influence of the nonlinear interactions in the
Navier-Stokes equations (NSE), respectively (McKeon & Sharma, J. Fluid Mech.,
658, 2010). Originating from the NSE, this framework provides an analytical
support for Townsend's attached-eddy model. Our main result is that
self-similarity enables order reduction in modeling the logarithmic region by
establishing a quantitative link between the self-similar structures and the
velocity spectra. Specifically, the energy intensities, the Reynolds stresses,
and the energy budget are expressed in terms of the resolvent modes with speeds
corresponding to the top of the logarithmic region. The weights of the triad
modes -the modes that directly interact via the quadratic nonlinearity in the
NSE- are coupled via the interaction coefficients that depend solely on the
resolvent modes (McKeon et al., Phys. Fluids, 25, 2013). We use the hierarchies
of self-similar modes in the logarithmic region to extend the notion of triad
modes to triad hierarchies. It is shown that the interaction coefficients for
the triad modes that belong to a triad hierarchy follow an exponential
function. The combination of these findings can be used to better understand
the dynamics and interaction of flow structures in the logarithmic region. The
compatibility of the proposed model with theoretical and experimental results
is further discussed.

transform a Boolean formula whose probability is difficult to compute, into one
whose probability is easy to compute, and which is guaranteed to provide an
upper or lower bound on the probability of the original formula by choosing
appropriate probabilities for the dissociated variables. Our new bounds shed
light on the connection between previous relaxation-based and model-based

performed on different glass-forming materials. The simulation results for the
mean-$n$th displacement $M_n(t)$ are then analyzed from the unified point of
view, where $n$ is an even number. Thus, it is first shown that in each type of
liquids there exists a master curve $H_n^{(i)}$ as
$M_n(t)=R^nH_n^{(i)}(v_{th}t/R;D/Rv_{th})$ onto which any simulation results
collapse at the same value of $D/Rv_{th}$, where $R$ is a characteristic length
such as an interatomic distance, $D$ a long-time self-diffusion coefficient,
$v_{th}$ a thermal velocity, and $i=$F and S. The master curves $H_n^{(F)}$ and
$H_n^{(S)}$ are then shown not to coincide with each other in the so-called
cage region even at the same value of $D/Rv_{th}$. Thus, it is emphasized that
the dynamics of strong liquids is quite different from that of fragile liquids.
A new type of strong liquids recently proposed is also tested systematically
from this unified point of view. The dynamics of a new type is then shown to be
different from that of well-known network glass formers in the cage region,
although both liquids are classified as a strong liquid. Thus, it is suggested
that a smaller grouping is further needed in strong liquids, depending on
whether they have a network or not.

that these turbulent systems also can show suppression of SF. Here we present
preliminary results from observations of HCGs with Herschel and CARMA, and
their [CII] and CO(1-0) properties to discuss how shocks influence galaxy
transitions and star formation.

synthesize very neutron-rich nuclides near, on or/and beyond the neutron drip

  Motivated by the problem of online handwriting recognition, we developed a
CNN for processing spatially-sparse inputs; a character drawn with a one-pixel
wide pen on a high resolution grid looks like a sparse matrix. Taking advantage
of the sparsity allowed us more efficiently to train and test large, deep CNNs.
On the CASIA-OLHWDB1.1 dataset containing 3755 character classes we get a test

provide a direct means to study fluctuation scaling in a trapped two-component
condensate. This quantum system supports a second-order phase transition
between miscible (co-spatial) and immiscible (symmetry-broken) states that is
driven by a diverging susceptibility to magnetic fluctuations. As the
transition is approached from the miscible side the magnetic susceptibility is
found to depend strongly on the geometry and orientation of the observation
cell. However, a scaling exponent consistent with that for the homogenous gas
($\gamma = 1$) can be recovered, for all cells considered, as long as the fit
excludes the region in the immediate vicinity of the critical point. As the
transition is approached from the immiscible side, the magnetic fluctuations
exhibit a non-trivial scaling exponent $\gamma \simeq 1.30$. Experimentally,
the observation cells may be formed either by considering individual imaging
pixels or by combining pixels to form larger cells, and fluctuation statistics
can be obtained by repeated \emph{in situ} images. Interestingly, on both sides
of the transition, we find it best to extract the exponents using an
observation cell that covers half of the trapped system. This implies that
relatively low-resolution \emph{in situ} imaging will be adequate for the
investigation of these exponents. We also investigate the gap energy and find
exponents $\nu z$ = 0.505 on the miscible side and, unexpectedly, $\nu z$ =
0.60(3) for the immiscible phase.

specifies the probability of an agent getting an object. We examine the
structural and computational aspects of ex post efficiency of random
assignments. We first show that whereas an ex post efficient assignment can be
computed easily, checking whether a given random assignment is ex post
efficient is NP-complete. Hence implementing a given random assignment via
deterministic Pareto optimal assignments is NP-hard. We then formalize another
concept of efficiency called robust ex post efficiency that is weaker than
stochastic dominance efficiency but stronger than ex post efficiency. We
present a characterization of robust ex post efficiency and show that it can be
tested in polynomial time if there are a constant number of agent types. It is
shown that the well-known random serial dictatorship rule is not robust ex post
efficient. Finally, we show that whereas robust ex post efficiency depends
solely on which entries of the assignment matrix are zero/non-zero, ex post

universe. This new model differs from the previous one in that the IR length
cutoff $L$ is taken to be exactly the event horizon size in a non-flat
universe, which is more natural and theoretically/conceptually concordant with
the model of holographic dark energy in a flat universe. We constrain the model
using the recent observational data including the type Ia supernova data from
SNLS3, the baryon acoustic oscillation data from 6dF, SDSS-DR7, BOSS-DR11, and
WiggleZ, the cosmic microwave background data from Planck, and the Hubble
constant measurement from HST. In particular, since some previous studies have
shown that the color-luminosity parameter $\beta$ of supernovae is likely to
vary during the cosmic evolution, we also consider such a case that $\beta$ in
SNLS3 is time-varying in our data fitting. Compared to the constant $\beta$
case, the time-varying $\beta$ case reduces the value of $\chi^2$ by about 35
and results in that $\beta$ deviates from a constant at about 5$\sigma$ level,
well consistent with the previous studies. For the parameter $c$ of the
holographic dark energy, the constant $\beta$ fit gives $c=0.65\pm 0.05$ and

Several needle like single crystals were obtained and the length of the needle
corresponds to the [001] crystallographic direction. Powder x-ray diffraction
revealed that CeAl crystallizes in orthorhombic CrB-type structure with space
group ${Cmcm}$ (no. 63). The magnetic properties have been investigated by
means of magnetic susceptibility, isothermal magnetization, electrical
transport, and heat capacity measurements. CeAl is found to order
antiferromagnetically with a N$\grave{\rm e}$el temperature $T_{\rm N}$ = 10K.
The magnetization data below the ordering temperature reveals two metamagentic
transitions for fields less than 20kOe. From the inverse magnetic
susceptibility an effective moment of $2.66\mu_{\rm B}$/Ce has been estimated,
which indicates that Ce is in its trivalent state. Electrical resistivity data
clearly shows a sharp drop at 10K due to the reduction of spin disorder
scattering of conduction electrons thus confirming the magnetic ordering. The
estimated residual resistivity ratio (RRR) is 33, thus indicating a good
quality of the single crystal. The bulk nature of the magnetic ordering is also
confirmed by heat capacity data. From the Schottky anomaly of the heat capacity
we have estimated the crystal field level splitting energies of the $(2J+1)$
degenerate ground state as 25K and 175K respectively for the fist and second
excited states.

frames, and associated with one entity (eg. a person). The task of \emph{Entity
Discovery} in videos can be naturally posed as tracklet clustering. We approach
this task by leveraging \emph{Temporal Coherence}(TC): the fundamental property
of videos that each tracklet is likely to be associated with the same entity as
its temporal neighbors. Our major contributions are the first Bayesian
nonparametric models for TC at tracklet-level. We extend Chinese Restaurant
Process (CRP) to propose TC-CRP, and further to Temporally Coherent Chinese
Restaurant Franchise (TC-CRF) to jointly model short temporal segments. On the
task of discovering persons in TV serial videos without meta-data like scripts,
these methods show considerable improvement in cluster purity and person
coverage compared to state-of-the-art approaches to tracklet clustering. We
represent entities with mixture components, and tracklets with vectors of very
generic features, which can work for any type of entity (not necessarily
person). The proposed methods can perform online tracklet clustering on
streaming videos with little performance deterioration unlike existing
approaches, and can automatically reject tracklets resulting from false
detections. Finally we discuss entity-driven video summarization- where some
temporal segments of the video are selected automatically based on the
discovered entities.

certain recurrence equations. These equations define a dynamical system. We
study two regimes with respect to parameters. In the first regime we establish
that the dynamical system has one attractive and two repelling fixed points,

including symmetry consideration, the Jackiw-Rebbi's index theorem, and the
quasiclassical theory. Special focus is placed on the symmetry protected
topological superfuidity of the $^3$He-B confined in a slab geometry. The
$^3$He-B under a magnetic field is separated to two different sub-phases: The
symmetry protected topological phase and non-topological phase. The former
phase is characterized by the existence of symmetry protected Majorana
fermions. The topological phase transition between them is triggered off by the
spontaneous breaking of a hidden discrete symmetry. The critical field is
quantitatively determined from the microscopic calculation that takes account
of magnetic dipole interaction of $^3$He nucleus. It is also demonstrated that
odd-frequency even-parity Cooper pair amplitudes are emergent in low-lying
quasiparticles. The key ingredients, symmetry protected Majorana fermions and
odd-frequency pairing, bring an important consequence that the coupling of the
surface states to an applied field is prohibited by the hidden discrete
symmetry, while the topological phase transition with the spontaneous symmetry
breaking is accompanied by anomalous enhancement and anisotropic quantum
criticality of surface spin susceptibility. We also illustrate common

modality for visualizing the electrical tissue properties of the human body
using radio-frequency magnetic fields. It uses the fact that in magnetic
resonance imaging systems the eddy currents induced by the radio-frequency
magnetic fields reflect the conductivity ($\sigma$) and permittivity
($\epsilon$) distributions inside the tissues through Maxwell's equations. The
corresponding inverse problem consists of reconstructing the admittivity
distribution ($\gamma=\sigma+i\omega\epsilon$) at the Larmor frequency
($\omega/2\pi=$128 MHz for a 3 tesla MRI machine) from the positive circularly
polarized component of the magnetic field ${\bf H}=(H_x,H_y,H_z)$. Previous
methods are usually based on an assumption of local homogeneity
($\nabla\gamma\approx 0$) which simplifies the governing equation. However,
previous methods that include the assumption of homogeneity are prone to
artifacts in the region where $\gamma$ varies. Hence, recent work has sought a
reconstruction method that does not assume local-homogeneity. This paper
presents a new magnetic resonance electrical property tomography reconstruction
method which does not require any local homogeneity assumption on $\gamma$. We
find that $\gamma$ is a solution of a semi-elliptic partial differential
equation with its coefficients depending only on the measured data $H^+$, which
enable us to compute a blurred version of $\gamma$. To improve the resolution
of the reconstructed image, we developed a new optimization algorithm that
minimizes the mismatch between the data and the model data as a highly
nonlinear function of $\gamma$. Numerical simulations are presented to
illustrate the potential of the proposed reconstruction method.

the closure phases and squared visibilities collected by PIONIER to search for

companion is assessed by computing the goodness of fit to the data for a series
of binary models with various separations and contrasts. Five stellar
companions are resolved for the first time around five A-type stars: HD 4150,
HD 16555, HD 29388, HD 202730, and HD 224392 (although the companion to HD
16555 was independently resolved by speckle interferometry while we were
carrying out the survey). In the most likely case of main sequence companions,
their spectral types range from A5V to K4V. Three of these stars were already
suspected to be binaries from Hipparcos astrometric measurements, although no
information was available on the companions themselves so far. In addition to
debiasing the statistics of the Exozodi survey, these results can also be used
to revise the fraction of visual binaries among A-type stars, suggesting that
an extra ~13% A-type stars are visual binaries in addition to the ones detected
in previous direct imaging surveys. We estimate that about half the population
of nearby A-type stars could be resolved as visual binaries using a combination
of state-of-the-art interferometry and single-aperture imaging, and we suggest
that a significant fraction of these binaries remains undetected to date.

protein, which is involved in both gene regulation and DNA compaction. Although
it is a key player in genome organization by forming bridges between DNA
duplexes, the precise structure of complexes of DNA and H-NS proteins is still
not well understood. In particular, it is not clear whether the structure of
DNA/H-NS complexes in the living cell is similar to that of complexes deposited
on mica surfaces, which may be observed by AFM microscopy. A coarse-grained
model, which helps getting more insight into this question, is described and
analyzed in the present paper. This model is able of describing both the
bridging of bacterial DNA by H-NS in the bulk and the deposition and
equilibration of the complex on a charged surface. Simulations performed with
the model reveal that a slight attraction between DNA and the charged surface
is sufficient to let DNA/H-NS complexes reorganize from 3D coils to planar
plasmids bridged by H-NS proteins similar to those observed by AFM microscopy.
They furthermore highlight the antagonistic effects of the interactions between
DNA and the surface. Indeed, increasing these interactions slows down the
equilibration of naked plasmids on the surface but, on the other hand, enables
a faster equilibration of DNA/H-NS complexes. Based on the distribution of the
lifetimes of H-NS bridges and the time evolution of the number of trans-binding
protein dimers during equilibration of the complexes on the surface, it is
argued that the decrease of the equilibration time of the complex upon increase
of the interaction strength between DNA and the surface is ascribable to the
associated decrease of the probability to form new bridges between DNA and the
proteins.

publications. In this article our framework is a single particle picture, where
we perform density functional theory calculations for the conductance
corresponding to both transport mechanisms for junctions with the central
molecule containing one, two or three Ruthenium centers, respectively, where we
extrapolate our results in order to define the critical length for the
transition point of the two regimes which we identify at 5.76 nm for this type
of molecular wire. We also discuss trends in dependence on an electrochemically

of non-radial solar-like oscillations. Of particular interest was the detection
of mixed modes that exhibit significant amplitude, both in the core and at the
surface of the stars. It opens the possibility of probing the internal
structure from their inner-most layers up to their surface along their
evolution on the red giant branch as well as on the red-clump. Our objective is
primarily to provide physical insight into the physical mechanism responsible
for mixed-modes amplitudes and lifetimes. Subsequently, we aim at understanding
the evolution and structure of red giants spectra along with their evolution.
The study of energetic aspects of these oscillations is also of great
importance to predict the mode parameters in the power spectrum. Non-adiabatic
computations, including a time-dependent treatment of convection, are performed
and provide the lifetimes of radial and non-radial mixed modes. We then combine
these mode lifetimes and inertias with a stochastic excitation model that gives
us their heights in the power spectra. For stars representative of CoRoT and
Kepler observations, we show under which circumstances mixed modes have heights
comparable to radial ones. We stress the importance of the radiative damping in
the determination of the height of mixed modes. Finally, we derive an estimate
for the height ratio between a g-type and a p-type mode. This can thus be used
as a first estimate of the detectability of mixed-modes.

dynamics of a small founding population consisting of k different genotypes or
strategies. As population sizes get large, these population processes are
well-approximated by a mean limit ordinary differential equation whose state
space is the k simplex. We prove that if this mean limit ODE has an attractor
at which the temporal averages of the population growth rate is positive, then
there is a positive probability of the population not going extinct (i.e.
growing without bound) and its distribution converging to the attractor.
Conversely, when the temporal averages of the population growth rate is
negative along this attractor, the population distribution does not converge to
the attractor. For the stochastic analog of the replicator equations which can
exhibit non-equilibrium dynamics, we show that verifying the conditions for
convergence and non-convergence reduces to a simple algebraic problem. We also
apply these results to selection-mutation dynamics to illustrate convergence to
periodic solutions of these population genetics models with positive

importance of both the Stewartson layer attached to the core and the boundary
conditions met by the fluid at the surface of the object. In the case of a
pre-main sequence star of intermediate mass where the envelope is stably
stratified, shortly after the birth line, the spin-up flow driven by
contraction overwhelms the baroclinic flow that would take place otherwise.This
model also shows that for a contracting envelope, a self-similar flow of
growing amplitude controls the dynamics. It suggests that initial conditions on
the birth line are most probably forgotten. Finally, the model shows that the
near (Stewartson) layer that lies on the tangent cylinder of the core is likely
a key feature of the dynamics that is missing in 1D models.This layer can
explain the core and envelope rotational coupling that is required to explain
the slow rotation of cores in giant and subgiants stars.

from the ABLA code. We have studied the sensitivity of the r-process abundances
to nuclear masses by using different models. Most of the trajectories,
corresponding to 90% of the ejected mass, follow a relatively slow expansion
allowing for all neutrons to be captured. The resulting abundances are very
similar to each other and reproduce the general features of the observed
r-process abundance (the second and third peaks, the rare-earth peak and the
lead peak) for all mass models as they are mainly determined by the fission
yields. We find distinct differences in the abundance yields at and just above
the third peak, which can be traced back to different predictions of neutron
separation energies for r-process nuclei around neutron number $N=130$. The
remaining trajectories, which contribute 10% by mass to the total integrated
abundances, follow such a fast expansion that the r process does not use all
the neutrons. This also leads to a larger variation of abundances among
trajectories as fission does not dominate the r-process dynamics. The total
integrated abundances are dominated by contributions from the slow abundances
and hence reproduce the general features of the observed r-process abundances.
We find that at timescales of weeks relevant for kilonova light curve
calculations, the abundance of actinides is larger than the one of lanthanides.
Hence actinides can be even more important than lanthanides to determine the
photon opacities under kilonova conditions. (Abridged)

evolving under a slowly varying protocol can be accurately obtained from
limited data and the closest known detailed state of the system. In this
manner, one needs to perform only a few detailed experiments to obtain the
nonequilibrium distribution function for the entire gamut of nonlinearity. We
achieve this by maximizing the relative entropy functional (MaxRent), which is
proportional to the Kullback-Leibler distance from a known density function,
subject to constraints supplied by the problem definition and new measurements.
MaxRent is thus superior to the principle of maximum entropy (MaxEnt), which
maximizes Shannon's informational entropy for estimating distributions but
lacks the ability of incorporating additional prior information. The MaxRent
principle is illustrated using a toy model of $\phi^4$ thermal conduction
consisting of a single lattice point. An external protocol controlled
position-dependent temperature field drives the system out of equilibrium. Two
different thermostatting schemes are employed: the Hoover-Holian deterministic
thermostat (which produces multifractal dynamics under strong nonlinearity) and
the Langevin stochastic thermostat (which produces phase space-filling
dynamics). Out of the 80 possible states produced by the protocol, we assume
that 4 states are known to us in detail, one of which is used as input into
MaxRent at a time. We find that MaxRent accurately approximates the phase space
density functions at all values of the protocol even when the known

Detecting and characterizing circumstellar dust is a way to study
the architecture and evolution of planetary systems. Cold dust in debris disks
only traces the outer regions. Warm and hot exozodiacal dust needs to be
studied in order to trace regions close to the habitable zone.
  Aims. We aim to determine the prevalence and to constrain the properties of
hot exozodiacal dust around nearby main-sequence stars.
  Methods. We search a magnitude limited (H < 5) sample of 92 stars for bright
exozodiacal dust using our VLTI visitor instrument PIONIER in the H-band. We
derive statistics of the detection rate with respect to parameters such as the
stellar spectral type and age or the presence of a debris disk in the outer
regions of the systems. We derive more robust statistics by combining our
sample with the results from our CHARA/FLUOR survey in the K-band. In addition,
our spectrally dispersed data allows us to put constraints on the emission
mechanism and the dust properties in the detected systems.
  Results. We find an over-all detection rate of bright exozodiacal dust in the
H-band of 11% (9 out of 85 targets) and three tentative detections. The
detection rate decreases from early type to late type stars and increases with
the age of the host star. We do not confirm the tentative correlation between
the presence of cold and hot dust found in our earlier analysis of the FLUOR
sample alone. Our spectrally dispersed data suggest that either the dust is
extremely hot or the emission is dominated by the scattered light in most
cases. The implications of our results for the target selection of future
terrestrial planet finding missions using direct imaging are discussed.

phenomenological model that distinguishes spin and spatial decoherence. We
identify the dominating mechanisms that affect quantum walk experiments
realized with neutral atoms walking in an optical lattice.
  From the measured spatial distributions, we determine with good precision the
amount of decoherence per step, which provides a quantitative indication of the
quality of our quantum walks. In particular, we find that spin decoherence is
the main mechanism responsible for the loss of coherence in our experiment. We
also find that the sole observation of ballistic instead of diffusive expansion
in position space is not a good indicator for the range of coherent
delocalization.
  We provide further physical insight by distinguishing the effects of short
and long time spin dephasing mechanisms. We introduce the concept of coherence
length in the discrete-time quantum walk, which quantifies the range of spatial
coherences. Unexpectedly, we find that quasi-stationary dephasing does not
modify the local properties of the quantum walk, but instead affects spatial
coherences.
  For a visual representation of decoherence phenomena in phase space, we have
developed a formalism based on a discrete analogue of the Wigner function. We
show that the effects of spin and spatial decoherence differ dramatically in
momentum space.

to redshift independent distance errors, observed galaxy velocities and those
predicted by the linear approximation from the density field agree. However, we
find peculiar velocities that are systematically more positive than model
predictions in the direction of the Shapley and Vela superclusters, and
systematically more negative than model predictions in the direction of the
Pisces-Cetus Supercluster, suggesting contributions from volumes not covered by

the very rare K ---> pi nu nu bar decays may be dented, but remains well alive
thanks to their intrinsic qualities. First, these decays are among the cleanest
observables in the quark flavor sector. When combined with their terrible
suppression in the Standard Model, they thus offer uniquely sensitive probes.
Second, the LHC capabilities are not ideal for all kinds of new physics, even
below the TeV scale. For example, rather elusive scenarios like
natural-SUSY-like hierarchical spectrum, baryon number violation, or new very
light but very weakly interacting particles may well induce deviations in rare
K decays. Even though experimentalists should brace themselves for tiny
deviations, these modes thus have a clear role to play in the LHC era.

systemic war. During their life span, these cycles show remarkable regularities
in their dynamics. The accelerated growth of the connectivity of the regulatory
network of the International System, in combination with its anarchistic
structure, produce and shape the war dynamics of the system. The accelerated
growth of the connectivity of the International System is fed by population
growth and the need for social systems to fulfill basic requirements. The
finite-time singularity and accompanying log-periodic oscillations were
instrumental in the periodic reorganization of the regulatory network of the
International System and contributed to a long-term process of social expansion
and integration in Europe. The singularity dynamic produced a series of
organizational innovations. At the critical time of the singularity (1939), the
connectivity of the system reached a critical threshold and resulted in a
critical transition that led to a fundamental reorganization of the
International System. Europe transformed from an anarchistic system to a
cooperative security community. During the life span of the cycles, the war
dynamics showed chaotic characteristics. These findings have implications for
the social sciences and historical research.

here reconsidered. It is pointed out that such an approach, unlike Majorana's
(non-chiral) old one, does not strictly lead, in general, to a true
self-conjugate particle. This can be seen on directly using the basic
definition (or fundamental representation) of charge conjugation $C$ in Quantum
Field Theory, as an operation just acting on annihilation and creation
operators and just expressing particle--antiparticle interchange. It is found,
indeed, that the `active' and `sterile' whole fields which can be obtained from
mixing the chiral components of two mutually charge-conjugate Dirac fields are
themselves `charge conjugate' to each other (rather than individually
self-conjugate). These fields, taken as mass eigenfields (as in the `Majorana
mass' case), are shown to describe particles carrying pseudoscalar-type charges
and being neutral relative to scalar-type charges only. For them, `$CP$
symmetry' would be nothing but pure mirror symmetry, and $C$ violation (already
implied in their respective `active' and `sterile' behaviors) should then
involve time-reversal violation as well. The new (no longer strictly
chargeless) `Majorana mass' neutrino model still proves, however, neither to
affect the usual expectation for a neutrinoless double $\beta$-decay, nor to
prevent `active' and `sterile' neutrino varieties from generally taking
different mass values. One has, on the other hand, that any fermion being just
a genuine (i.e. really self-conjugate) Majorana particle cannot truly exist in
two distinct $-$ `active' and `sterile' $-$ versions, and it can further bear
only a unified mass kind which may at once be said to be either a
`Majorana-like' or a `Dirac-like' mass kind.

  In the Nash paradigm, rational players consider that the opponent's strategy

behavior of agents with an alternate form of rationality that involves a
Stackelberg competition with the past.
  Agents with this form of rationality integrate in their reasoning that they
have such accurate logical and predictive skills, that the world is fully
transparent: all players share the same knowledge and know as much as an
omniscient external observer. In particular, there is common knowledge of the
solution of the game including the reached outcome and the thought process
leading to it. The PPE is stable given each player's knowledge of its actual
outcome and uses no assumptions at unreached nodes.
  This paper gives the general definition and construction of the PPE as a
fixpoint problem, proves its existence, uniqueness and Pareto optimality, and
presents two algorithms to compute it. Finally, the PPE is put in perspective

the masses of the final Schwarzschild black holes are computed as a function of

critical phenomena in gravitational collapse at the threshold between different

  If both sets have dimension 0, then the problem is related to the analytic

set is a single point, and the other is a convex body, then it is equivalent by
polar duality to the existence and uniqueness of the Santal\'o point. For a

edge-circumscribed convex polytopes and is related to the conformal barycenter
of Douady-Earle. If both sets are $d$-dimensional, then we are led to define
the Santal\'o point of a pair of convex bodies. We prove that the Santal\'o
point of a pair exists and is unique, if one of the bodies is contained within

However, their objective is different. While template detection identifies the
template of a webpage (usually comparing with other webpages of the same
website), content extraction identifies the main content of the webpage
discarding the other part. Therefore, they are somehow complementary, because
the main content is not part of the template. It has been measured that
templates represent between 40% and 50% of data on the Web. Therefore,
identifying templates is essential for indexing tasks because templates usually
contain irrelevant information such as advertisements, menus and banners.
Processing and storing this information is likely to lead to a waste of
resources (storage space, bandwidth, etc.). Similarly, identifying the main
content is essential for many information retrieval tasks. In this paper, we
present a benchmark suite to test different approaches for template detection

solids immersed in a fluid, which permits mechanical interactions between all
phases. The reference map variable is exploited to simulate finite-deformation
constitutive relations in the solid(s) on the same fixed grid as the fluid
phase, which greatly simplifies the coupling between phases. Our coupling
procedure, a key contribution in the current work, is shown to be
computationally faster and more stable than an earlier approach, and admits the
ability to simulate both fluid--solid and solid--solid interaction between
submerged bodies. The interface treatment is demonstrated with multiple
examples involving a weakly compressible Navier--Stokes fluid interacting with
a neo-Hookean solid, and we verify the method's convergence. The solid contact
method, which exploits distance-measures already existing on the grid, is
demonstrated with two examples. A new, general routine for cross-interface
extrapolation is introduced and used as part of the new interfacial treatment.

systems considered here, no charge transfer should be expected at large
intermolecular separation according to photoemission experiment and accurate
quantum-chemistry calculations. The capability of hybrid exchange-correlation
functionals of reproducing this feature depends critically on the fraction of
exact exchange $\alpha$, as for small values of $\alpha$ spurious fractional
charge transfer is observed between the donor and the acceptor. G0W0 based on
hybrid DFT yields the correct alignment of the frontier orbitals for all values
of $\alpha$. However, G0W0 has no capacity to alter the ground-state properties
of the system, because of its perturbative nature. The electron density in
donor-acceptor compounds thus remains incorrect for small $\alpha$ values. In
sc-GW, where the Green's function is obtained from the iterative solution of
the Dyson equation, the electron density is updated and reflects the correct
description of the level alignment at the GW level, demonstrating the
importance of self-consistent many-body approaches for the description of

hide or reveal personal information in online social networks (OSNs). However,
with the increasing use of OSNs, it becomes more important to understand the
role of the social network in disclosing personal information that a user has
not revealed voluntarily: How much of our private information do our friends
disclose about us, and how much of our privacy is lost simply because of online
social interaction? Without strong technical effort, an OSN may be able to
exploit the assortativity of human private features, this way constructing
shadow profiles with information that users chose not to share. Furthermore,
because many users share their phone and email contact lists, this allows an
OSN to create full shadow profiles for people who do not even have an account
for this OSN.
  We empirically test the feasibility of constructing shadow profiles of sexual
orientation for users and non-users, using data from more than 3 Million
accounts of a single OSN. We quantify a lower bound for the predictive power
derived from the social network of a user, to demonstrate how the
predictability of sexual orientation increases with the size of this network
and the tendency to share personal information. This allows us to define a
privacy leak factor that links individual privacy loss with the decision of
other individuals to disclose information. Our statistical analysis reveals
that some individuals are at a higher risk of privacy loss, as prediction
accuracy increases for users with a larger and more homogeneous first- and
second-order neighborhood of their social network. While we do not provide
evidence that shadow profiles exist at all, our results show that disclosing of
private information is not restricted to an individual choice, but becomes a
collective decision that has implications for policy and privacy regulation.

order to construct identifiable statistical models. Often, the essential
topological feature is a hierarchical structure of boundaries (faces, edges,
corners, etc.) which we represent as a hierarchical graph known as a Hasse
diagram. Low-dimensional elements of this diagram are simple models that
describe the dominant behavioral modes, what we call emergent model classes.
Observations that preserve the Hasse diagram are diffeomorphically related and
form a group, the collection of which form a partially ordered set. All
possible observations have a semi-group structure. For hierarchical models, we
consider how the topology of simple models is embedded in that of larger
models. When emergent model classes are unstable to the introduction of new
parameters, we classify the new parameters as relevant. Conversely, the
emergent model classes are stable to the introduction of irrelevant parameters.
In this way, information topology provides a general language for exploring
representations of physical systems and their relationships to observations.

of the inner accretion flow of astrophysical black holes and the nature of

discuss the possibility to use Stokes parameters - a commonly used tool in
radio, infrared, and optical polarimetry - to analyze the data from X-ray
polarimeters such as scattering polarimeters and photoelectric effect
polarimeters, which measure the linear polarization of the detected X-rays.
Based on the azimuthal scattering angle (in the case of a scattering
polarimeter) or the azimuthal component of the angle of the electron ejection
(in the case of a photoelectric effect polarimeter), the Stokes parameters can
be calculated for each event recorded in the detector. Owing to the additive
nature of Stokes parameters, the analysis reduces to adding the Stokes
parameters of the individual events and subtracting the Stokes parameters
characterizing the background (if present). The main strength of this kind of
analysis is that the errors on the Stokes parameters can be computed easily and
are well behaved - in stark contrast of the errors on the polarization fraction
and polarization direction. We demonstrate the power of the Stokes analysis by
deriving several useful formulae, e.g. the expected error on the polarization
fraction and polarization direction for a detection of $N_S$ signal and
$N_{BG}$ background events, the optimal observation times of the signal and
background regions in the presence of non-negligible background contamination
of the signal, and the minimum detectable polarization (MDP) that can be
achieved when following this prescription.

to the alignment and stretching of constituent fibers within the vicinity of
cells. As a consequence, the matrix reorganizes to form thick bundles of
aligned fibers that enable force transmission over distances larger than the
size of the cells. Contractile force-mediated remodeling of ECM fibers has
bearing on a number of physiologic and pathophysiologic phenomena. In this
work, we present a computational model to capture cell-mediated remodeling
within fibrous matrices using finite element based discrete fiber network
simulations. The model is shown to accurately capture collagen alignment,
heterogeneous deformations, and long-range force transmission observed
experimentally. The zone of mechanical influence surrounding a single
contractile cell and the interaction between two cells are predicted from the
strain-induced alignment of fibers. Through parametric studies, the effect of
cell contractility and cell shape anisotropy on matrix remodeling and force
transmission are quantified and summarized in a phase diagram. For highly

approach and results using catalogues from various surveys. i.e., X-Rays

that the results from the statistical classifications of the three methods are

separation into populations of reliable and unreliable sources in catalogues.

from their host stars, and this flow is often controlled by magnetic fields.
More specifically, near the planetry surface, the magnetic pressure dominates
the ram pressure of the outflow by several orders of magnitude. After leaving
the vicinity of the planet, the flow must connect onto the background
environment provided by the stellar wind and the stellar magnetic field. This
contribution considers magnetically controlled planetary outflows and extends
previous work by comparing two different geometries for the background magnetic
field provided by the star. In the first case, stellar field is assumed to
retain the form of a dipole, which is anti-aligned with the dipole field of the
planet. In the second case, the stellar outflow opens up the stellar magnetic
field structure so that the background field at the location of the planet is
perpendicular to the planetary dipole. Using numerical simulations, we consider
the launch of the planetary wind with these field configurations.

MDE may provide the right level of abstraction to move the study of complex

paper we apply modularity concepts for domain specific languages (DSLs) and
discuss how they help to design new languages by extending existing ones and
composing fragments to new DSLs. We use an extended grammar format with
appropriate tool support that avoids redefinition of existing functionalities
by introducing language inheritance and embedding as first class artifacts in a
DSL definition. Language embedding and inheritance is not only assisted by the
parser, but also by the editor, and algorithms based on tree traversal like
context checkers, pretty printers, and code generators. We demonstrate that
compositional engineering of new languages becomes a useful concept when
starting to define project-individual DSLs using appropriate tool support.

electron transitions with a macroscopic spatial discontinuity. The effect is
related to the fundamental indivisibility of macroscopic orbit-like quantum
states reminiscent of so-called extended states in the integer quantum Hall
system. The test has become realizable due to the discovering of a quantum
phase with spontaneous pervasive quantum ordering reminiscent of that of a
single atom. The observed transitions may be regarded as a peculiar quantum
dynamics beyond relativity, which implies that the current relativistic model
of universe should be replaced by a deeper quantum model. It is the Bohm's
model of undivided universe, which now should involve a deeper-than-classical
concept of absolute simultaneity and a deeper-than-relativistic concept of
space and time. Ultimately, our test thus establishes a new hierarchy of
fundamental physical theories where the de Broglie-Bohm realistic quantum
theory is the deepest theory which does not contradict either classical physics
or relativity but rather is beyond both. This is because the fact that quantum
theory is dealing with a deeper reality where physical objects are not
self-sufficient entities and therefore their discontinuous transitions are
possible within an overall quantum system which may well be macroscopic.

thought to be due to rapid, but local, transfer of information between group
members. These groups turn together in unison and produce escape waves.
However, it is not clear how escape waves are created from local interactions,
nor is it understood how these patterns are shaped by natural selection. By
startling schools of fish with a simulated attack in an experimental arena, we
demonstrate that changes in the direction and speed by a small percentage of
individuals that detect the danger initiate an escape wave. This escape wave
consists of a densely packed band of individuals that causes other school
members to change direction. In the majority of cases this wave passes through
the entire group. We use a simulation model to demonstrate that this mechanism
can, through local interactions alone, produce arbitrarily large escape waves.
In the model, when we set the group density to that seen in real fish schools,
we find that the risk to the members at the edge of the group is roughly equal
to the risk of those within the group. Our experiments and modelling results
provide a plausible explanation for how escape waves propagate in Nature
without centralised control.

with phase transitions. We introduce a stylized model for the build-up and
collapse of trust in networks, which generically displays a first order
transition. The basic assumption of our model is that whereas trust begets
trust, panic also begets panic, in the sense that a small decrease in trust may
be amplified and ultimately lead to a sudden and catastrophic drop of trust. We
show, using both numerical simulations and mean-field analytic arguments, that
there are extended regions of the parameter space where two equilibrium states
coexist: a well-connected network where confidence is high, and a poorly
connected network where confidence is low. In these coexistence regions,
spontaneous jumps from the well-connected state to the poorly connected state
can occur, corresponding to a sudden collapse of trust that is not caused by
any major external catastrophe. In large systems, spontaneous crises are
replaced by history dependence: whether the system is found in one state or in
the other essentially depends on initial conditions. Finally, we document a new
phase, in which agents are connected yet distrustful.

contacts among individuals and analyzed the influence of the network properties
on the characterization of the quasi-stationary state. We computed probability
density functions (PDF) for infected fraction of individuals and found that
they are well fitted by gamma functions, excepted the tails of the
distributions that are q-exponentials. We also computed the fluctuation power
spectra of infective time series for different networks. We found that network
effects can be partially absorbed by rescaling the rate of infective contacts
of the model. An explicit relation between the effective transmission rate of
the disease and the correlation of susceptible individuals with their infective
nearest neighbours was obtained. This relation quantifies the known screening
of infective individuals observed in these networks. We finally discuss the
goodness and limitations of the SIR model with homogeneous mixing and
parameters taken from epidemiological data to describe the dynamic behaviour
observed in the networks studied.
