  Trans. Information Theory",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, we propose an input-output space clustering criterion (IOCC)
to optimize the locations of the remote antenna units (RAUs) of generalized
Distributed Antenna Systems (DASs) under sum power constraint. In IOCC, the
input space refers to RAU location space and output space refers to location
specific ergodic capacity space for noise-limited environments. Given a
location-specific arbitrary desired ergodic capacity function over a
geographical area, we define the error as the difference between actual and
desired ergodic capacity. Our investigations show that i) the IOCC provides an
upper bound to the cell averaged ergodic capacity error; and ii) the derived
upper bound is equal to a weighted quantization error function in
location-capacity space (input-output space) and iii) the upper bound can be
made arbitrarily small by a clustering process increasing the number of RAUs
for a feasible DAS. IOCC converts the RAU location problem into a codebook
design problem in vector quantization in input-output space, and thus includes
the Squared Distance Criterion (SDC) for DAS in [15] (and other related papers)
as a special case, which takes only the input space into account. Computer
simulations confirm the theoretical findings and show that the IOCC outperforms
the SDC for DAS in terms of the defined cell averaged ""effective"" ergodic
capacity.

the crystallographic c-axis, the application of H leads to the suppression of
the SDW-state through a 2^nd-order phase-transition at a theta-dependent
critical-field H_p(theta) leading to the observation of small Fermi surfaces
(FSs) in the paramagnetic (PM) state. For H || c-axis, these FSs are
characterized by light mu's pointing also to the suppression of the

quantum-criticality (QC). But as $H$ is rotated towards the a-axis, these mu's
increase considerably becoming undetectable for \theta > 56^0 between H and the

coupled to the divergence of mu, indicates the existence of a field-induced

continuous suppression of all relevant energy scales at H_p(theta,T) should

equilibrium. This is also the case if dark matter can be treated as a
self-gravitating collisionless gas experiencing Lynden-Bell's type of violent
relaxation. In order to avoid the infinite mass problem and carry out a
rigorous stability analysis, we consider the fermionic King model. In this
paper, we study the non-degenerate limit leading to the classical King model.
This model was initially introduced to describe globular clusters. We propose
to apply it also to large dark matter halos where quantum effects are
negligible. We determine the caloric curve and study the thermodynamical
stability of the different configurations. Equilibrium states exist only above
a critical energy $E_c$ in the microcanonical ensemble and only above a
critical temperature $T_c$ in the canonical ensemble. For $E<E_c$, the system
undergoes a gravothermal catastrophe and, for $T<T_c$, it undergoes an
isothermal collapse. We compute the profiles of density, circular velocity, and
velocity dispersion. We compare the prediction of the classical King model to
the observations of large dark matter halos. Because of collisions and
evaporation, the central density increases while the slope of the halo density
profile decreases until an instability takes place. We show that large dark
matter halos are relatively well-described by the King model at, or close to,
the point of marginal microcanonical stability. At that point, the King model
generates a density profile that can be approximated by the modified Hubble
profile. This profile has a flat core and decreases as $r^{-3}$ at large
distances, like the observational Burkert profile. Less steep halos are
unstable.

other conditions. To characterize how these consequences of adaptation depend
on the physical similarity between environments, we evolved 180 populations of
Saccharomyces cerevisiae at different degrees of stress induced by either salt,
temperature, pH, or glucose depletion. We measure how the fitness of clones
adapted to each environment depends on the intensity of the corresponding type
of stress. We find that clones evolved in a given type and intensity of stress
tend to gain fitness in other similar intensities of that stress, and lose
progressively more fitness in more physically dissimilar environments. These
fitness trade-offs are asymmetric: adaptation to permissive conditions incurred
a smaller trade-off in stressful conditions than vice versa. We also find that
fitnesses of clones are highly correlated across similar intensities of stress,
but these correlations decay towards zero in more dissimilar environments. To
interpret these results, we introduce the concept of a joint distribution of
fitness effects of new mutations in multiple environments (the JDFE), which
describes the probability that a given mutation has particular fitness effects
in some set of conditions. We find that our observations are consistent with
JDFEs that are highly correlated between physically similar environments, and
that become less correlated and asymmetric as the environments become more

""condensed"" phase dominated by quantum mechanics. The phase diagram exhibits
two critical points, one in each ensemble, beyond which the phase transitions
disappear. There also exist a region of negative specific heats and a situation
of ensemble inequivalence for sufficiently large systems. We apply the
fermionic King model to the case of dark matter halos made of massive
neutrinos. The gaseous phase describes large halos and the condensed phase
describes dwarf halos. Partially degenerate configurations describe
intermediate size halos. We argue that large dark matter halos cannot harbor a
fermion ball because these nucleus-halo configurations are thermodynamically
unstable (saddle points of entropy). Large dark matter halos may rather contain
a central black hole resulting from a dynamical instability of relativistic
origin occurring during the gravothermal catastrophe.

wind turbine and a doubly-fed induction generator (DFIG). The models of these
three components are coupled via nonlinear power flow equations. In contrast to
the traditional approach for solving the power flows via iterative methods that
often lead to only local solutions, we apply a recently developed
parameter-homotopy based numerical continuation algorithm to compute all
possible solutions. The method solves the power flow equations over multiple
values of the wind penetration level with far less computational effort instead
of solving them at each value individually. We observe that depending on the
penetration limit and the setpoint value for the magnitude of the wind bus
voltage, the system may exhibit several undesired or even unstable equilibria.
We illustrate these results through a detailed simulation of a 5-machine power

helpful for small-signal stability assessment.

facilitate distributed multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communication in
future systems. We study a distributed reception scenario in which a
transmitter equipped with multiple antennas sends multiple streams via spatial
multiplexing to a large number of geographically separated single antenna
receive nodes. The receive nodes then quantize their received signals and
forward the quantized received signals to a receive fusion center. With global
channel knowledge and forwarded quantized information from the receive nodes,
the fusion center attempts to decode the transmitted symbols. We assume the
transmit vector consists of phase shift keying (PSK) constellation points, and
each receive node quantizes its received signal with one bit for each of the
real and imaginary parts of the signal to minimize the transmission overhead
between the receive nodes and the fusion center. Fusing this data is a
non-trivial problem because the receive nodes cannot decode the transmitted
symbols before quantization. Instead, each receive node processes a single
quantity, i.e., the received signal, regardless of the number of transmitted
symbols. We develop an optimal maximum likelihood (ML) receiver and a
low-complexity zero-forcing (ZF)-type receiver at the fusion center. Despite
its suboptimality, the ZF-type receiver is simple to implement and shows
comparable performance with the ML receiver in the low signal-to-noise ratio
(SNR) regime but experiences an error rate floor at high SNR. It is shown that
this error floor can be overcome by increasing the number of receive nodes.
Hence, the ZF-type receiver would be a practical solution for distributed
reception with spatial multiplexing in the era of the IoT where we can easily
have a large number of receive nodes.

solutions of the compressible Euler equations may blow up near the origin at
certain time under some circumstance. The central feature is the strengthening
of waves as they move radially inward. A longstanding open, fundamental
question is whether concentration could form at the origin. In this paper, we
develop a method of vanishing viscosity and related estimate techniques for
viscosity approximate solutions, and establish the convergence of the
approximate solutions to a global finite-energy entropy solution of the
compressible Euler equations with spherical symmetry and large initial data.
This indicates that concentration does not form in the vanishing viscosity
limit, even though the density may blow up at certain time. To achieve this, we
first construct global smooth solutions of appropriate initial-boundary value
problems for the Euler equations with designed viscosity terms, an approximate
pressure function, and boundary conditions, and then we establish the strong
convergence of the viscosity approximate solutions to a finite-energy entropy

atomic level, determining the ground state multiplet of the electrons. It
consists of three laws: (i) maximum $S$ (total spin), (ii) maximum $L$ (total
orbital angular momentum) under the constraint of (i), and (iii) the total
angular momentum $J$ is $|L-S|$ for electron number less than half, while
$J=L+S$ for more than half due to the relativistic spin-orbit interaction
(SOI). In real systems, the electrons hop between the atoms and gain the
itinerancy, which is usually described by the band theory. The whole content of
theories on correlation is to provide a reliable way to describe the
intermediate situation between the two limits. Here we propose an approach
toward this goal, i.e., we study the two-atom systems of three $t_{2g}$
orbitals and see how the Hund's rule is modified by the transfer integral $t$
between them. It is found that the competition between $t$ and the Hund's
coupling $J$ at each atom determines the crossover from the molecular orbital
limit to the strong correlation limit. Especially, the focus is on the
generalization of the third rule, i.e., the inter-and intra-atomic SOI's in the
presence of the correlation. We have found that there are cases where the
effective SOI's are appreciably enhanced by the Hund's coupling. The conditions
for the enhancement are the intermediate Hund's coupling and the filling of
four or five electrons.

employs a linear approximation of the objective function such that the

propose two different variation methods: one uses continuous relaxation of the
discrete space and the other uses convex combinations of the vector field and
running payoff. The approximate problem is a 0-1 linear program, which can be
solved by existing polynomial-time exact or approximation algorithms, and does
not require the solution of the dynamical system. Furthermore, we characterize

long-baseline accelerator neutrino experiment. The flux is used to measure
neutrino cross sections at the near detector, while at the far detector it
provides an estimate of the expected signal for the study of neutrino
oscillations. In the talk several approaches to constrain the neutrino flux are
presented. The first is the traditional one when an interaction chain for the
neutrino parent hadrons is stored to be weighted later with real measurements.
In this approach differential hadron cross sections are used which, in turn,
are measured in ancillary hadron production experiments. The approach is
certainly model dependent because it requires an extrapolation to different
incident nucleon momenta assuming x_F scaling as well as extrapolation between
materials having different atomic numbers. In the second approach one uses a
hadron production yields off a real target exploited in the neutrino beamline.
Yields of neutrino parent hadrons are parametrized at the surface of the
target, thus one avoids to trace the particle interaction history inside the
target. As in the case of the first approach, a dedicated ancillary experiment
is mandatory. Recent results from the hadron production experiments -
NA61/SHINE at CERN (measurements for T2K) and MIPP at Fermilab (measurements
for NuMI) - are reviewed.

the creation of an ensemble of identical quantum states, together with position
measurements on those states, are described by Bohm's quantum dynamics. The

of helical Majorana modes. In this paper, using extensive numerical

states under strong surface disorder, which influences both bulk and surface
states. To characterize the effects of strong disorder, we compute the level
spacing statistics and the local density of states of both two- and
three-dimensional topological superconductors. The Majorana surface states,
which are located in the outermost layers of the superconductor, are protected
against weak disorder, due to their topological characteristic. Sufficiently
strong disorder, on the other hand, partially localizes the surface layers,
with a more pronounced effect on states with energies close to the gap than on
those with energies close to zero. In particular, we observe that for all
disorder strengths and configurations there always exist two extended states at
zero-energy that can carry thermal current. At the crossover from weak to
strong disorder the surface state wave functions and the local density of
states show signs of critical delocalization. We find that at this crossover
the edge density of states of two-dimensional topological superconductors
exhibits a zero-energy divergence, reminiscent of the Dyson singularity of
quasi-one-dimensional dirty superconductors.

states, namely the chimera and oscillation death. In this paper we show that
the chimera death can be induced in a network of generic identical oscillators
with mean-field diffusive coupling and thus we establish that a non local
coupling is not essential to obtain chimera death. We identify a new transition
route to the chimera death state, namely the transition from in-phase
synchronized oscillation to chimera death via global amplitude death state. We
ascribe the occurrence of chimera death to the bifurcation structure of the
network in the limiting condition and show that multi-cluster chimera death
states can be achieved by a proper choice of initial conditions.

representation of possibly high-dimensional functions exhibiting strong
anisotropic features and low regularity in isotropic Sobolev or Besov scales.
Specifically, we focus on the solution of transport equations which exhibit
propagation of singularities where, additionally, high-dimensionality enters
when the convection field, and hence the solutions, depend on parameters
varying over some compact set. Important constituents of our approach are
directionally adaptive discretization concepts motivated by compactly supported
shearlet systems, and well-conditioned stable variational formulations that
support trial spaces with anisotropic refinements with arbitrary
directionalities. We prove that they provide tight error-residual relations
which are used to contrive rigorously founded adaptive refinement schemes which
converge in $L_2$. Moreover, in the context of parameter dependent problems we
discuss two approaches serving different purposes and working under different
regularity assumptions. For frequent query problems, making essential use of
the novel well-conditioned variational formulations, a new Reduced Basis Method
is outlined which exhibits a certain rate-optimal performance for indefinite,
unsymmetric or singularly perturbed problems. For the radiative transfer
problem with scattering a sparse tensor method is presented which mitigates or
even overcomes the curse of dimensionality under suitable (so far still
isotropic) regularity assumptions. Numerical examples for both methods
illustrate the theoretical findings.

existence of elliptic curves of various conductors, and then by using more
sophisticated search techniques (for instance, torsion subgroups, twisting, and
the Cremona-Lingham algorithm) to find them. We then compute further invariants
of these curves, such as their rank and representatives of all isogeny classes.

number of millisecond pulsars (MSPs). Due to the number of stars, the stellar
and MSP winds mix efficiently within the GC. Such mixture of winds leaves GC
and interacts with the galactic medium creating a bow shock nebula around GC.
The bow shock nebula is filled with relativistic leptons accelerated in the
pulsar magnetospheres and/or wind regions. We argue that nebulae around
globular clusters, immersed in relatively dense medium close to the galactic
plane, should have complicated morphology due to interaction with the
surrounding gas. Therefore, TeV $\gamma$-ray sources, related to these nebulae,
are expected to be misaligned in respect to GC cores, as observed in the case
of GC Ter 5. On the other hand, GCs in low density medium, i.e. far away from
the galactic disk, should produce bow shocks at large distances from the GC
cores. The TeV $\gamma$-ray sources around such nebulae are expected to be
almost spherical and centred on the GC cores. We perform numerical calculations
of the TeV $\gamma$-ray emission produced by leptons escaping from the GC Ter
5. It is shown that TeV $\gamma$-ray source related to Ter 5 should be
misaligned in respect to the core of GC as observed by the HESS Collaboration.

downward closure of any language is regular. Although the downward closure
seems to be a promising abstraction, there are only few language classes for
which an automaton for the downward closure is known to be computable.
  It is shown here that for stacked counter automata, the downward closure is
computable. Stacked counter automata are finite automata with a storage
mechanism obtained by \emph{adding blind counters} and \emph{building stacks}.
Hence, they generalize pushdown and blind counter automata.
  The class of languages accepted by these automata are precisely those in the
hierarchy obtained from the context-free languages by alternating two closure
operators: imposing semilinear constraints and taking the algebraic extension.
The main tool for computing downward closures is the new concept of Parikh

thermodynamics has enabled hyper-potent physical technologies from the internal
combustion engine to the hydrogen bomb, so information theory has enabled
hyper-persuasive technologies, from color television to addictive video games.
Only a theory of what a brain is and does based on those same principles makes
legible and transparent the mechanisms by which such hyper-persuasion works. In
information-theoretic terms, a brain is a specialized real-valued real-time 3D
processor detecting discontinuities in spacetime outside itself and
reconstituting in itself a continuous reality based on them. This continuous
approach is difficult to reconcile with any computational architecture based on
separate neurons, and in fact the vast discrepancy in efficiency (of order at
least a hundred million) between those architectures constitutes the
calculations of this paper. This remarkable signal-processing requires strong
prior hypotheses embedded in 3D edge-detecting algorithms, priors which
unfortunately also open an unpatchable security hole to automated persuasion.
So a 3D model of the brain is essential for understanding how and why
persuasive technologies alter our perception of reality, and for protecting us

various Lorenz-like systems and the possibility of universal consideration of
their behavior, in view of the possibility of reduction of such systems to the
same form with the help of various transformations. In the present paper the
differences and similarities in the analysis of the Lorenz, the Chen and the Lu
systems are discussed and it is shown that the Chen and the Lu systems are
valuable for the development of new methods for the analysis of chaotic
systems.

  Function-Based Music","12 pages, 2 figures",,,,"math.GM","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper attempts to look for a mathematical method of composing music by
incorporating Schonbergs idea of tone rows and matrix theory from linear
algebra. The elements of a note set S are considered as the integer values for
the natural notes based on the C Major Scale and rational numbers for
semitones. The elements of S are effectively mapped by a polynomial function to
another note set T. To accomplish this, S is treated as a column vector,
applied to the matrix equation Ax equals b, where x denotes the vector S, b
denotes the resulting set T, and A represents a square matrix. This method
yields functions capable of mapping input note sets to others, thereby creating
collections of sets that can be permuted in any order to form musical
harmonies.

events were simulated according to the extension of Standard Model (SM) and the
Left-Right symmetry Model (LRSM) based on the gauge symmetry group SU(3)C
SU(2)L SU(2)R U(1)B-L. The LRSM model exhibits signatures of new physics Beyond
the Standard Model (BSM) at the hadrons colliders.

studies have systematically explored human mobility patterns over large
populations and large time scales. Relatively little attention, however, has
been paid to mobility and activity over smaller time-scales, such as a day.
Here, we use Twitter to identify people's frequently visited locations along
with their likely activities as a function of time of day and day of week,
capitalizing on both the content and geolocation of messages. We subsequently
characterize people's transition pattern motifs and demonstrate that spatial
information is encoded in word choice.

conformally-invariant Sobolev-type inequalities on the Heisenberg group, in
analogy with the Euclidean case. By considering the variation of associated
functionals, we give a stability of two dual forms: the fractional Sobolev
(Folland-Stein) and Hardy-Littlewood-Sobolev inequality, in terms of distance
to the submanifold of extremizers. Then we compare their remainder terms to
improve the inequalities in another way. We also compare, in the limit case s =
Q (or $\lambda$ = 0), the remainder terms of Beckner-Onofri inequality and its
dual Logarithmic Hardy-Littlewood-Sobolev inequality. Besides, we also list
without proof some results for the other two cases of groups of Iwasawa-type.
Our results generalize earlier works on Euclidean spaces by Chen, Frank, Weth
[CFW13] and Dolbeault, Jankowiakin [DJ14] onto some groups of Heisenberg-type.
