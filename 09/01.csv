using lessons from massive gravity. The theory contains all of the elementary
symmetric polynomials and is treated in the Palatini formalism. We show how the
connection can be solved algebraically to be the Levi-Civita connection of an
effective metric. The non-linearity of the algebraic equations yields several
branches, one of which always reduces to General Relativity at low curvatures.
We explore in detail a {\it minimal} version of the theory, for which we study
solutions in the presence of a perfect fluid with special attention to the
cosmological evolution. In vacuum we recover Ricci-flat solutions, but also an
additional physical solution corresponding to an Einstein space. The existence
of two physical branches remains for non-vacuum solutions and, in addition, the
branch that connects to the Einstein space in vacuum is not very sensitive to
the specific value of the energy density. For the branch that connects to the
General Relativity limit we generically find three behaviours for the Hubble
function depending on the equation of state of the fluid, namely: either there
is a maximum value for the energy density that connects continuously with
vacuum, or the energy density can be arbitrarily large but the Hubble function
saturates and remains constant at high energy densities, or the energy density
is unbounded and the Hubble function grows faster than in General Relativity.
The second case is particularly interesting because it could offer an
interesting inflationary epoch even in the presence of a dust component.
Finally, we discuss the possibility of avoiding certain types of singularities
within the minimal model.

to very small mass ratios of these objects. The decline rates during the
plateau phase in the superoutburst of these objects were lower than those of SU
UMa-type DNe with a similar superhump period. These properties were similar to
those of SSS J122221.7-311523, the best candidate for the period bouncer.

because we cannot transfer it (with unchanged parameters) from one condition to
another. I argue that exact equations require calibrated multiscale analysis to
deal with ions. Exact theories in biochemistry must use mathematics of
interactions because biological ionic solutions, derived from seawater, are
complex (not simple) fluids. The activity of one ion depends on every other
ion. Mathematics of conservative interactions is well understood but friction
is another matter. Mathematicians now have now an energetic variational
calculus dealing with friction. Complex fluids need variational methods because
everything interacts with everything else. Mathematics designed to handle
interactions is needed to produce exact equations. If interactions are not
addressed with variational mathematics, they are bewildering. The mathematics
must include the global properties of the electric field. Flow of charge in one
place changes the flow everywhere by Kirchoff and Maxwell laws. Charge changes
physical nature as it flows through a circuit. It is ions in salt water; it is
electrons in a vacuum tube; it is quasi-particles in a semiconductor; and it is
nothing much in a vacuum capacitor (i.e., displacement current). Charge is
abstract. The physical nature of charge and current is strikingly diverse; yet,
the flow of current is exactly the same in every element in a series circuit.
The global nature of electric flow prevents the law of mass action from being
exact. The law of mass action (with rate constants that are constant) does not
know about charge. The law of mass action is about mass conservation. I believe
the law of mass action must be modified to be consistent with the Kirchoff
current law if biochemistry is to be an exact science.

multiple transitions driven by several laser frequencies. We analyze how
magneto-optical trapping forces depend on the angular momenta, $F_l$ and $F_u$,
and the g-factors, $g_l$ and $g_u$, of the lower and upper states. When $F_l >
F_u$ the polarizations must be reversed relative to cases where $F_u \ge F_l$.
The correct choice of circular polarization depends on the sign of $g_{u}$ but
not on the sign of $g_{l}$. If $g_{u}$ is zero there is no trapping force, and
the trapping force is very weak whenever $g_u$ is small compared to $g_l$,
which it usually is when the cooling transition is the $^{2}\Sigma$ to
$^{2}\Pi_{1/2}$ transition of a molecule. For some molecules, mixing of the
excited $^{2}\Pi_{1/2}$ state with a nearby $^{2}\Sigma$ excited state can
greatly increase $g_u$, leading to stronger trapping forces. A strong trapping
force can also be produced by rapidly and synchronously reversing both the
magnetic field and the laser polarizations. We simulate a recent experiment on
magneto-optical trapping of SrF molecules, and suggest that an alternative
choice of laser beam polarizations will strengthen the trapping force.

makes developers more productive are discussed with fervor, and their answers
are too often based on anecdotes and unsubstantiated beliefs. In this study, we
use the largely untapped research potential of Rosetta Code, a code repository
of solutions to common programming tasks in various languages, to draw a fair
and well-founded comparison. Rosetta Code offers a large data set for analysis.
Our study is based on 7087 solution programs corresponding to 745 tasks in 8
widely used languages representing the major programming paradigms (procedural:
C and Go; object-oriented: C# and Java; functional: F# and Haskell; scripting:
Python and Ruby). Our statistical analysis reveals, most notably, that:
functional and scripting languages are more concise than procedural and
object-oriented languages; C is hard to beat when it comes to raw speed on
large inputs, but performance differences over inputs of moderate size are less
pronounced and allow even interpreted languages to be competitive; compiled
strongly-typed languages, where more defects can be caught at compile time, are
less prone to runtime failures than interpreted or weakly-typed languages. We
discuss implications of these results for developers, language designers, and
educators.

transitioning from its flaring to quiescent optical states,and was
characterized by only moderate flux changes at different wavelengths on the

increasing optical flux can be noted in the collected dataset, but only
occasionally and only at higher flux levels. We did not find any universal
relation between the very high-energy $\gamma$-ray and optical flux changes on
the timescales from days and weeks up to several years. On the other hand, we
noted that at higher flux levels the source can follow two distinct tracks in
the optical flux-colour diagrams, which seem to be related to distinct
$\gamma$-ray states of the blazar. The obtained results therefore indicate a
complex scaling between the optical and $\gamma$-ray emission of PKS

and a $\gamma$-ray flux depending on the combination of an optical flux and
colour rather than a flux alone.

after a phase in which a core and companion spiral to smaller separation inside
a common envelope (CE).Such a phase can end with the merging of the two stars
or with the ejection of the envelope to leave a surviving binary system.The
outcome is usually predicted by calculating the separation to which the stars
must spiral to eject the envelope, assuming that the ratio of the
core--envelope binding energy to the change in orbital energy is equal to a
constant efficiency factor $\alpha$. If either object would overfill its Roche
lobe at this end-of-CE separation, then the stars are assumed to merge. It is
unclear what critical radius should be compared to the end-of-CE Roche lobe for
stars which have developed cores before the start of a CE phase. After
improving the core radius formulae in the widely used BSE rapid evolution code,
we compare the properties of populations in which the critical radius is chosen
to be the pre-CE core radius or the post-CE stripped remnant radius. Our
improvements to the core radius formulae and the uncertainty in the critical
radius significantly affect the rates of merging in CE phases of most types. We
find the types of systems for which these changes are most important.

multiple empirical findings that have been hard to account for by the
traditional feedforward model of sensory processing, including the
task-dependence of neural response correlations, and the diverging time courses
of choice probabilities and psychophysical kernels. Our model makes a number of
new predictions and, importantly, characterizes a component of correlated

performance-degrading noise. It also demonstrates a normative way to integrate
sensory and cognitive components into physiologically testable mathematical
models of perceptual decision-making.

We first demonstrate, analytically and numerically, that the five-moment model
reduces to the widely used Hall Magnetohydrodynamics (Hall MHD) model under the

quasi-neutrality. Then, we compare ten-moment and fully kinetic
Particle-In-Cell (PIC) simulations of a large scale Harris sheet reconnection
problem, where the ten-moment equations are closed with a local linear
collisionless approximation for the heat flux. The ten-moment simulation gives
reasonable agreement with the PIC results regarding the structures and

'jet-mode' (radiatively-inefficient) radio-AGN out to z=1, in order to
investigate the cosmic evolution of radio-AGN feedback. Eight radio source
samples are combined to produce a catalogue of 211 radio-loud AGN with
0.5<z<1.0, which are spectroscopically classified into jet-mode and
radiative-mode (radiatively-efficient) AGN classes. Comparing with large
samples of local radio-AGN from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, the cosmic
evolution of the radio luminosity function of each radio-AGN class is
independently derived. Radiative-mode radio-AGN show an order of magnitude
increase in space density out to z~1 at all luminosities, consistent with these
AGN being fuelled by cold gas. In contrast, the space density of jet-mode
radio-AGN decreases with increasing redshift at low radio luminosities (L_1.4 <
1e24 W/Hz) but increases at higher radio luminosities. Simple models are
developed to explain the observed evolution. In the best-fitting models, the
characteristic space density of jet-mode AGN declines with redshift in
accordance with the declining space density of massive quiescent galaxies,
which fuel them via cooling of gas in their hot haloes. A time delay of 1.5-2
Gyr may be present between the quenching of star formation and the onset of
jet-mode radio-AGN activity. The behaviour at higher radio luminosities can be
explained either by an increasing characteristic luminosity of jet-mode
radio-AGN activity with redshift (roughly as (1+z) cubed) or if the jet-mode
radio-AGN population also includes some contribution of cold-gas-fuelled
sources seen at a time when their accretion rate was low. Higher redshifts
measurements would distinguish between these possibilities.

first, a decline in measures of social participation has occurred in many OECD
countries. Second, and more recently, the success of social networking sites
(SNSs) has resulted in a steep rise in online social participation. Our study
adds to this body of research by conducting the first empirical assessment of
how online networking affects two economically relevant aspects of social
capital, i.e. trust and sociability. We address endogeneity in online
networking by exploiting technological characteristics of the pre-existing
voice telecommunication infrastructures that exogenously determined the
availability of broadband for high-speed Internet. We find that participation
in SNSs such as Facebook and Twitter has a positive effect on face-to-face
interactions. However, social trust decreases with online interactions. We
argue that the rising practice of hate speech may play a crucial role in the
destruction of trust.

Additional circumstances favoring the superstorm were (i) the exact impact of
the spheromak on the Earth's magnetosphere and (ii) the almost exact southward
orientation of the magnetic field, corresponding to the original orientation in

scattering length becomes negative. On the atomic side of the resonance, the
transition from condensate to Feshbach insulator has a characteristic
first-order nature, due to the simultaneous loss of coherence in the atomic and

outage behavior of cooperative networks aided by energy harvesting relay node

inferring connectivity in neural circuits with up to thousands of neurons.
However, a key challenge in using calcium imaging for connectivity detection is
that current systems often have a temporal response and frame rate that can be
orders of magnitude slower than the underlying neural spiking process. Bayesian
inference methods based on expectation-maximization (EM) have been proposed to
overcome these limitations, but are often computationally demanding since the
E-step in the EM procedure typically involves state estimation for a
high-dimensional nonlinear dynamical system. In this work, we propose a
computationally fast method for the state estimation based on a hybrid of loopy
belief propagation and approximate message passing (AMP). The key insight is
that a neural system as viewed through calcium imaging can be factorized into
simple scalar dynamical systems for each neuron with linear interconnections
between the neurons. Using the structure, the updates in the proposed hybrid
AMP methodology can be computed by a set of one-dimensional state estimation
procedures and linear transforms with the connectivity matrix. This yields a
computationally scalable method for inferring connectivity of large neural
circuits. Simulations of the method on realistic neural networks demonstrate
good accuracy with computation times that are potentially significantly faster
than current approaches based on Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods.

that $N_\mathrm{eff}$ probably plays the most important role in reducing the
tension. We also find that the results obtained from fitting without adopting
the consistency relation do not deviate much from the consistency relation.
With available Planck, WMAP, BICEP2 and BAO datasets all together, we obtain
$r_{0.002} = 0.14_{-0.11}^{+0.05}$, $n_\mathrm{t} = 0.35_{-0.47}^{+0.28}$,

Remarkably, there exists no method to measure these forces directly during free
flight. Such in vivo recordings in freely behaving animals are essential to
better understand the precise aerodynamic function of their flapping wings, in
particular during the downstroke versus upstroke. Here we demonstrate a new
aerodynamic force platform (AFP) for nonintrusive aerodynamic force measurement
in freely flying animals and robots. The platform encloses the animal or object
that generates fluid force with a physical control surface, which mechanically
integrates the net aerodynamic force that is transferred to the earth. Using a
straightforward analytical solution of the Navier-Stokes equation, we verified
that the method is accurate. We subsequently validated the method with a
quadcopter that is suspended in the AFP and generates unsteady thrust profiles.
These independent measurements confirm that the AFP is indeed accurate. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of the AFP by studying aerodynamic weight support

consistent with the recent experimental observation of two-magnon dynamics
[Nature 502, 76 (2013)]. The two interacting particles can undergo independent-
and/or co-walking depending on both quantum statistics and interaction
strength. Two strongly interacting particles may form a bound state and then
co-walk like a single composite particle with statistics-dependent walk speed.
Analytical solutions for the scattering and bound states, which appear in the
two-particle quantum walks, are obtained by solving the eigenvalue problem in
the two-particle Hilbert space. In the context of degenerate perturbation
theory, an effective single-particle model for the quantum co-walking is
analytically derived and the walk seep of bosons is found to be exactly three
times of the ones of fermions/HCBs. Our result paves the way for experimentally
exploring quantum statistics via two-particle quantum walks.

content is revisited making use of a cluster sample for which all four basic
parameters are homogeneously measured within consistent radii, namely
core-excised mass-weighted metallicity plus total, stellar and ICM masses. For
clusters of total mass $M_{500} >$ $\sim 10^{14}$ $M_{\odot}$ nice agreement is
found between their iron content and what expected from empirical supernova
yields. For the same clusters, there also appears to be at least as much iron
in the intracluster medium (ICM) as there is still locked into stars (i.e., the
ICM/stars metal share is about unity). However, for more massive clusters the
stellar mass fraction appears to drop substantially without being accompanied
by a drop in the ICM metallicity, thus generating a major tension with the
nucleosynthesis expectation and inflating the metal share to extremely high
values (up to $\sim 6$). Various possible solutions of this conundrum are
discussed, but are all considered either astrophysically implausible, or
lacking an independent observational support. For this reason we still
entertain the possibility that even some of the best cluster data may be
faulty, though we are not able to identify any obvious bias. Finally, based on
the stellar mass-metallicity relation for local galaxies we estimate the
contribution of galaxies to the ICM enrichment as a function of their mass,
concluding that even the most massive galaxies must have lost a major fraction
of the metals they have produced.

state $|G(\lambda_i)\rangle$ of the ITF Hamiltonian $H_E(\lambda_i)$ with an

Hamiltonian $H_{Tot}=H_E(\lambda_f) + H_I$ where $H_I$ describes a local
interaction between the qubits and the spin chain. The resulting dynamics leads
to a disentanglement of the qubits, which is described through the Wooter's
Concurrence, due to there interaction with the non-equilibrium environment. The
concurrence is related to the Loschmidt echo which in turn is expressed in
terms of the time-dependent covariance matrix associated to the ITF. This
permits a precise numerical and analytical analysis of the disentanglement

calculations of the thermonuclear 33S(p,gamma)34Cl rate in classical nova

impact on nova nucleosynthesis of remaining nuclear physics uncertainties in
the reaction rate. We find that these uncertainties lead to a factor of less
than 5 variation in the 33S(p,gamma)34Cl rate over typical nova peak
temperatures, and variation in the ejected nova yields of S--Ca isotopes by

As recent type II supernova models predict ratios of 130 - 200, the 32S/33S
ratio may be used to distinguish between grains of nova and supernova origin.

contribution of the pion zero-mode. Inserting non-zero momentum to relevant

cancel the zero-mode's contribution, which becomes non-perturbatively large
$\sim \mathcal{O}(100 \%)$ in the $\epsilon$ regime. The remaining finite
volume dependence, which comes from the non-zero momentum modes, is shown to be
perturbatively small even in such an extremal case. Since the zero-mode's
dominance is universal in any finite volume scaling, and we do not rely on any
particular feature of the $\epsilon$ expansion, our method has a wide

complete set of spin 0 interactions at leading and subleading orders (LO and
NLO) in $\frac{1}{N_c}$counting, including the recently derived NLO explicit
chiral symmetry breaking interactions which are of the same order as the 't
Hooft flavour determinant. The parameters of the model are tightly constrained
by the low energy characteristics in both the pseudoscalar and scalar meson

the inclusion of the explicit chiral symmetry breaking interactions, which
therefore can be seen to act as a catalyst in the production of strange quark

into account the 't Hooft interaction in the NLO. It can be traced back to the

solving exponential integrators. The important ingredient to the implementation
of exponential integrators is the efficient and accurate evaluation of the so
called $\varphi$-functions on a given vector. The Krylov subspace method is an
important technique for this problem. For this type of method, however,
restarts become essential for the sake of storage requirements or due to the
growing computational complexity of evaluating the matrix function on a
Hessenberg matrix of growing size. Another problem in computing
$\varphi$-functions is the lack of a clear residual notion. The contribution of
this work is threefold. First, we introduce a framework of the harmonic Arnoldi
method for $\varphi$-functions, which is based on the residual and the oblique
projection technique. Second, we establish the relationship between the
harmonic Arnoldi approximation and the classical Arnoldi approximation, and
compare the harmonic Arnoldi method with the Arnoldi method from a theoretical
point of view. Third, we apply the thick-restarting strategy to the harmonic
Arnoldi method, and propose a thick-restated harmonic Arnoldi algorithm for
evaluating $\varphi$-functions. An advantage of the new algorithm is that we
can compute several $\varphi$-functions simultaneously in the same search
subspace. We show the merit of augmenting approximate eigenvectors in the
search subspace, and give insight into the relationship between the error and
the residual of $\varphi$-functions. Numerical experiments show the superiority
of our new algorithm over many state-of-the-art algorithms for the computation
of $\varphi$-functions.

allows one to track several groups of drivers, each of them being characterized
only by their destination in the network. The path actually followed to reach
the destination is not assigned a priori, and can be chosen by the drivers
during the journey, taking decisions at junctions.
  The model is then used to describe three possible behaviors of drivers,
associated to three different ways to solve the route choice problem: 1.
Drivers ignore the presence of the other vehicles; 2. Drivers react to the
current distribution of traffic, but they do not forecast what will happen at
later times; 3. Drivers take into account the current and future distribution
of vehicles. Notice that, in the latter case, we enter the field of
differential games, and, if a solution exists, it likely represents a global
equilibrium among drivers.
  Numerical simulations highlight the differences between the three behaviors
and suggest the existence of multiple Wardrop equilibria.

Previous work on low-mass planets generally kept the planet on a fixed orbit,
after which the torque on the planet was measured. In addition to these static
torques, when the planet is allowed to migrate it experiences dynamical
torques, which are proportional to the migration rate and whose sign depends on
the background vortensity gradient. We show that in discs a few times more
massive than the Minimum Mass Solar Nebula, these dynamical torques can have a
profound impact on planet migration. Inward migration can be slowed down
significantly, and if static torques lead to outward migration, dynamical
torques can take over, taking the planet beyond zero-torque lines set by
saturation of the corotation torque in a runaway fashion. This means the region
in non-isothermal discs where outward migration is possible can be larger than
what would be concluded from static torques alone.

problems facing the cold dark matter (CDM), and has become an emerging
contender to challenge the CDM. It however requires a particle mass $\sim 1 - 2
\times10^{-22}$eV. We find such an extremely small particle mass can naturally
arise from a non-QCD axion mechanism, under fairly general assumptions that a
few species of self-interacting light particles of comparable masses and a
massless gauge boson decouple from the bright sector since the photon
temperature exceeds 200 GeV, and the axion is the dominant dark matter. These
assumptions also set the axion decay constant scale to several $\times 10^{16}$
GeV. Given the above axion mass range, we further pin down the dark-sector
particles to consist of only one species of fermion and anti-fermion, likely
right-handed neutrinos. With a mass around $92-128$ eV, the dark-sector
particles may constitute a minority population of dark matter. If the gauge
boson lives on SU(2), a dilute instanton gas can contribute about $2.5\%$ of

eigenmode, consisting of propagating surface waves which reflect at the
northern/southern ionospheres forming a standing wave. While the
eigenfrequencies of these so-called Kruskal-Schwartzschild (KS) modes have been
estimated under typical conditions, the potential distribution of frequencies
over the full range of solar wind conditions is not know. Using models of the
magnetosphere and magnetosheath applied to an entire solar cycle's worth of
solar wind data, we perform time-of-flight calculations yielding a database of
KS mode frequencies. Under non-storm times or northward interplanetary magnetic
field (IMF), the most likely fundamental frequency is calculated to be
$0.64_{-0.12}^{+0.03}$mHz, consistent with previous estimates and indirect
observational evidence for such standing surface waves of the subsolar
magnetopause. However, the distributions exhibit significant spread (of order
$\pm$0.3mHz) demonstrating that KS mode frequencies, especially higher
harmonics, should vary considerably depending on the solar wind conditions. The
implications of such large spread on observational statistics are discussed.
The subsolar magnetopause eigenfrequencies are found to be most dependent on
the solar wind speed, southward component of the IMF and the Dst index, with
the latter two being due to the erosion of the magnetosphere by reconnection
and the former an effect of the expression for the surface wave phase speed.
Finally, the possible occurrence of MPSEs is shown to be controlled by the
dipole tilt angle.

board Fermi, becoming the gamma-ray flaring blazar at the highest redshift
detected so far. At the peak of the flare the source reached an apparent
isotropic gamma-ray luminosity of 6.6 x 10^49 erg/s which is comparable to the

variability with a time lag of about 4-6 months. The luminosity increase is

that both sophisticated strategies for generating well-distributed random

critically important for efficient testing. We propose several approaches and
evaluate their effectiveness on a collection of injected bugs of varying

branch (AGB) is mainly controlled by the rate at which these stars lose mass in
a stellar wind. Understanding the driving mechanism and strength of the stellar
winds of AGB stars and the processes enriching their surfaces with products of
nucleosynthesis are paramount to constraining AGB evolution and predicting the
chemical evolution of galaxies. In a previous paper we have constrained the
structure of the outflowing envelope of W Hya using spectral lines of the
$^{12}$CO molecule. Here we broaden this study by modelling an extensive set of
H$_{2}$O and $^{28}$SiO lines observed by the three instruments on board
Herschel using a state-of-the-art molecular excitation and radiative transfer
code. The oxygen isotopic ratios and the $^{28}$SiO abundance profile can be
connected to the initial stellar mass and to crucial aspects of dust formation
at the base of the stellar wind, respectively. The modelling of H$_{2}$O and
$^{28}$SiO confirms the properties of the envelope model of W Hya derived from
$^{12}$CO lines. We find an H$_2$O ortho-to-para ratio of
2.5\,$^{+2.5}_{-1.0}$, consistent with what is expected for an AGB wind. The
O$^{16}$/O$^{17}$ ratio indicates that W Hya has an initial mass of about 1.5
M$_\odot$. Although the ortho- and para-H$_{2}$O lines observed by HIFI appear
to trace gas of slightly different physical properties, a turbulence velocity
of $0.7\pm0.1$ km s$^{-1}$ fits the HIFI lines of both spin isomers and those
of $^{28}$SiO well. The ortho- and para-H$_2^{16}$O and $^{28}$SiO abundances
relative to H$_{2}$ are $(6^{+3}_{-2}) \times 10^{-4}$, $(3^{+2}_{-1}) \times
10^{-4}$, and $(3.3\pm 0.8)\times 10^{-5}$, respectively. Assuming a solar
silicon-to-carbon ratio, the $^{28}$SiO line emission model is consistent with
about one-third of the silicon atoms being locked up in dust particles.

on the case when these models are endowed with particular kinetic terms
involving a linear power in momenta. New dimensional regularization and
renormalization schemes are introduced for particular models in this class: a
rank 3 tensor model, an infinite tower of matrix models $\phi^{2n}$ over
$U(1)$, and a matrix model over $U(1)^2$. For all divergent amplitudes, we
identify a domain of meromorphicity in a strip determined by the real part of
the group dimension $D$. From this point, the ordinary subtraction program is
applied and leads to convergent and analytic renormalized integrals.
Furthermore, we identify and study in depth the Symanzik polynomials provided
by the parametric amplitudes of generic rank $d$ Abelian models. We find that
these polynomials do not satisfy the ordinary Tutte's rules

emerges at the $\Gamma$ point, in addition to the existing hole pocket with
large $k_F$. The data show that near $x =x_c$, the temperature dependence of
$C(T)/T$ at low $T$ gets stronger as $x$ approaches $x_c$ from below and then
reverses the trend and changes sign at $x \geq x_c$. We argue that this

show that magnetic fluctuations are enhanced near $x_c$ at momenta around $k_F$

critical regime where $C(T)/T$ roughly scales as $\log T$. This behavior
extends to progressively lower $T$ as $x$ increases towards a magnetic

final states containing a boosted massive jet and a hard lepton, in addition to
a top quark and possibly a forward jet, offer a new window to both detecting
and measuring top partners of mass $\sim 2$ TeV. Our resulting signal
significance is comparable or superior to the same sign di-lepton channels for
top partner masses heavier than roughly 1 TeV. Unlike the di-lepton channel,
the selection criteria we propose are sensitive both to $5/3$ and $1/3$ charge
top partners and allow for full reconstruction of the resonance mass peak.
  Our search strategy utilizes a simplified $b$-tagging procedure and the
Template Overlap Method to tag the massive boosted objects and reject the
corresponding backgrounds. In addition, we propose a new, pileup insensitive
method, to tag forward jets which characterize our signal events.
  We consider full effects of pileup contamination at 50 interactions per bunch

the significance we obtain is sufficient to claim a discovery over a wide range

Fermi-liquid theory, we construct a topological Fermi-liquid theory, applicable
to interacting Weyl metals in the absence of time reversal symmetry. Following
the Landau's Fermi-liquid theory, we obtain an effective free-energy functional
in terms of the density field of chiral fermions. The density field of chiral
fermions is determined by a self-consistent equation, minimizing the effective
free-energy functional with respect to the order-parameter field. Beyond these
thermodynamic properties, we construct Boltzmann transport theory to encode
both the Berry curvature and the chiral anomaly in the presence of forward
scattering of a Fermi-liquid state, essential for understanding dynamic
correlations in interacting Weyl metals. This generalizes the Boltzmann
transport theory for the Landau's Fermi-liquid state in the respect of
incorporating the topological structure and extends that for noninteracting
Weyl metals in the sense of introducing the forward scattering. Finally, we
justify this topological Fermi-liquid theory, generalizing the
first-quantization description for noninteracting Weyl metals into the
second-quantization representation for interacting Weyl metals. First, we
derive a topological Fermi-gas theory, integrating over high-energy electronic
degrees of freedom deep inside a pair of chiral Fermi surfaces. As a result, we
reproduce a topological Drude model with both the Berry curvature and the
chiral anomaly. Second, we take into account interactions between such
low-energy chiral fermions on the pair of chiral Fermi surfaces. We perform the
renormalization group analysis, and find that only forward scattering turns out
to be marginal above possible superconducting transition temperatures,
justifying the topological Fermi-liquid theory of interacting Weyl metals with
time reversal symmetry breaking.

IDEs play an important role in software development projects today, and will
not be replaced entirely by web-based environments in the near future.
Therefore, supporting a mixture of hosted tools and tools integrated into
desktop IDEs is a sensible approach. In this paper, we present the SSELab, a
framework for web- based project portals that attempts to migrate more software
development tools from desktop to server environments, but still allows their
integration into modern desktop IDEs. It supports the deployment of tools as
hosted services using plug-in systems on the server-side. Additionally, it
provides access to these tools by a set of clients that can be used in
different contexts, either from the command line, from within IDEs such as
Eclipse, or from web pages. In the paper, we discuss the architecture and the

are increasingly being used in comprehensive weather and climate prediction
models as well as reduced order climate models. Stochastic methods are used as
subgrid-scale parameterizations as well as for model error representation,
uncertainty quantification, data assimilation and ensemble prediction. The need
to use stochastic approaches in weather and climate models arises because we
still cannot resolve all necessary processes and scales in comprehensive
numerical weather and climate prediction models. In many practical applications
one is mainly interested in the largest and potentially predictable scales and
not necessarily in the small and fast scales. For instance, reduced order
models can simulate and predict large scale modes. Statistical mechanics and
dynamical systems theory suggest that in reduced order models the impact of
unresolved degrees of freedom can be represented by suitable combinations of
deterministic and stochastic components and non-Markovian (memory) terms.
Stochastic approaches in numerical weather and climate prediction models also
lead to the reduction of model biases. Hence, there is a clear need for
systematic stochastic approaches in weather and climate modelling. In this
review we present evidence for stochastic effects in laboratory experiments.
Then we provide an overview of stochastic climate theory from an applied
mathematics perspectives. We also survey the current use of stochastic methods
in comprehensive weather and climate prediction models and show that stochastic
parameterizations have the potential to remedy many of the current biases in
these comprehensive models.

absorbed power law, which is softer than the previous quiescent epoch (up to
2013 June). The strong correlation between the X-ray and the UV emissions
indicates that the same mechanism should be responsible for part of the
emission in these bands. Optical and infrared photometric observations show
that the companion star is strongly irradiated. Double-peaked emission lines in
the optical spectra provide compelling evidence for the presence of an outer
accretion disc too. The spectral energy distribution from IR to X-rays is well
modelled if the contributions from the companion, the disc and the intra-binary

terms of an engulfed radio pulsar: the radio pulsar is still active, but
undetectable in the radio band due to a large amount of ionized material
surrounding the compact object. X-rays and gamma-rays are produced in an
intra-binary shock front between the relativistic pulsar wind and matter from

similar features to many related systems, revealing a zero magnetic field AF1

were not reported yet for any of the related compounds. In addition, only the
Ho$_2$RhIn$_8$ phase diagram contains a small region of the incommensurate
zero-field AF3 phase. We have performed a number of neutron diffraction
experiments on single crystals of Ho$_2$RhIn$_8$ using several diffractometers
including experiments in both horizontal and vertical magnetic fields up to 4
T. We present details of the magnetic structures in all magnetic phases of the
rich phase diagram of Ho$_2$RhIn$_8$. The Ho magnetic moments point along the
tetragonal $c$ axis in every phase. The ground-state AF1 phase is characterized
by propagation vector $\textbf{k}$ = (1/2, 0, 0). The more complex
ferrimagnetic AF2 phase is described by four propagation vectors
$\textbf{k}_{0}$ = (0, 0, 0), $\textbf{k}_{1}$ = (1/2, 0, 0), $\textbf{k}_{2}$
= (0, 1/2, 1/2), $\textbf{k}_{3}$ = (1/2, 1/2, 1/2). The magnetic structure in
the AF3 phase is incommensurate with $\textbf{k}_{AF3}$ = (0.5, $\delta$, 0).
Our results are consistent with theoretical calculations based on crystal field

impossible to use a two-mode Gaussian state possessing a positive-definite
Wigner function to demonstrate nonlocality as the Wigner function itself
provides a local hidden-variable model. In particular, when one performs
continuous-variable (CV) quadrature measurements upon a routinely generated CV
entanglement, namely, the two-mode squeezed vacuum (TMSV) state, the resulting
Wigner function is positive-definite and as such, the TMSV state cannot violate
any Bell inequality using CV quadrature measurements. We show here, however,
that a Bell inequality for CV states in terms of entropies can be quantum
mechanically violated by the TMSV state with two coarse-grained quadrature
measurements per site within experimentally accessible parameter regime. The
proposed CV entropic Bell inequality is advantageous for an experimental test,
especially for a possible loophole-free test of nonlocality, as the quadrature

from star-forming galaxies with 1.4 < z < 1.7 and M_stellar>~10^10 Msolar. With
the high multiplex capability of FMOS, it is now feasible to construct samples
of over one thousand galaxies having spectroscopic redshifts at epochs that
were previously challenging. The high-resolution mode (R~2600) effectively
separates Halpha and [NII]6585 thus enabling studies of the gas-phase
metallicity and photoionization state of the interstellar medium. The primary
aim of our program is to establish how star formation depends on stellar mass
and environment, both recognized as drivers of galaxy evolution at lower
redshifts. In addition to the main galaxy sample, our target selection places
priority on those detected in the far-infrared by Herschel/PACS to assess the
level of obscured star formation and investigate, in detail, outliers from the
star formation rate - stellar mass relation. Galaxies with Halpha detections
are followed up with FMOS observations at shorter wavelengths using the J-long

random, and that all the impacts must be interpreted as uncorrelated events
distributed according to Poisson statistics. If this is correct, their impact
dates must be uniformly spread throughout the year and their impact coordinates
must be evenly scattered on the surface of our planet. Here, we use a time- and
yield-limited sample of Earth-impacting superbolides detected since 2000 to
explore statistically this critical though frequently overlooked topic. We show
that the cadence of these multi-kiloton impact events is incompatible with a
random fall pattern at the 0.05 significance level or better. This result is
statistically robust and consistent with the observed distribution of the
longitudes of the ascending nodes of near-Earth objects (NEOs). This lack of
randomness is induced by planetary perturbations, in particular Jupiter's, and
suggests that some of the recent, most powerful Earth impacts may be associated
with resonant groups of NEOs and/or very young meteoroid streams. An intriguing
consequence of this scenario is that the impact hazard of Chelyabinsk-like
objects should peak at certain times in the year.

transmission is controlled by a random state. Both encoders transmit a common
message and, one of the encoders also transmits an individual message. We study
the capacity region of this communication model for different degrees of
availability of the states at the encoders, causally or strictly causally. In
the case in which the states are revealed causally to both encoders but not to
the decoder we find an explicit characterization of the capacity region in the
discrete memoryless case. In the case in which the states are revealed only
strictly causally to both encoders, we establish inner and outer bounds on the
capacity region. The outer bound is non-trivial, and has a relatively simple
form. It has the advantage of incorporating only one auxiliary random variable.
We then introduce a class of cooperative multiaccess channels with states known
strictly causally at both encoders for which the inner and outer bounds agree;
and so we characterize the capacity region for this class. In this class of
channels, the state can be obtained as a deterministic function of the channel

strictly causally, in an asymmetric manner, to only one encoder. Throughout the

of these examples. The results shed more light on the utility of delayed
channel state information for increasing the capacity region of state-dependent
cooperative multiaccess channels; and tie with recent progress in this

symplectic manifold. Second, we perform an (almost) symplectic reduction,
relying on the existence of a momentum map. In this case, we verify that the
resulting (almost) symplectic reduced spaces are the leaves of the
characteristic foliation of the reduced nonholonomic bracket. On each leaf we
study the (Lagrangian) equations of motion, obtaining a nonholonomic version of
the Lagrange-Routh equations, and we analyze the existence of a conformal
factor for the reduced bracket in terms of the existence of conformal factors
for the almost symplectic leaves. We also relate the conditions for the
existence of a momentum map for the compressed system with gauge
transformations by 2-forms. The results are illustrated in three different

objectives are achieved by utilising two spacecraft with identical

exfoliated from its bulk counterpart. Phosphorene oxide, by analogy to graphene
oxide, is expected to have novel chemical and electronic properties, and may
provide an alternative route to synthesis of phosphorene. In this letter, we
investigate physical and chemical properties of the phosphorene oxide including
its formation by the oxygen adsorption on the bare phosphorene. Analysis of the
phonon dispersion curves finds stoichiometric and non-stoichiometric oxide
configurations to be stable at ambient conditions, thus suggesting that the
oxygen absorption may not degrade the phosphorene. The nature of the band gap
of the oxides depends on the degree of the functionalization of phosphorene;
indirect gap is predicted for the non-stoichiometric configurations whereas a
direct gap is predicted for the stoichiometric oxide. Application of the
mechanical strain and external electric field leads to tunability of the band
gap of the phosphorene oxide. In contrast to the case of the bare phosphorene,
dependence of the diode-like asymmetric current-voltage response on the degree
of stoichiometry is predicted for the phosphorene oxide.

system study, we have found three distinct types of temporal behaviour of p53,
namely, oscillation death, damped oscillation and sustain oscillation,
depending on the amount of stress induced by the NO concentration, indicating
how p53 responds to the incoming stress. The correlation among the coupled
systems increases as the value of coupling constant (\epsilon) is increased
(\gamma increases) and becomes constant after certain value of \epsilon. The
permutation entropy spectra H(\epsilon) for p53 and MDM2 as a function of
\epsilon are found to be different due to direct and indirect interaction of NO
with the respective proteins. \gamma versus \epsilon for p53 and MDM2 are found
to be similar in deterministic approach, but different in stochastic approach
and the separation between \gamma of the respective proteins as a function of
\epsilon decreases as system size increases. The role of NO is found to be
twofold: stress induced by it is prominent at small and large values of
\epsilon but synchrony inducing by it dominates in moderate range of \epsilon.
Excess stress induce apoptosis to the system.

neutral antimatter atoms such as positronium, muonium and antihydrogen. Among
those, the project GBAR in CERN aims to measure precisely the gravitational
fall of ultracold antihydrogen atoms. In the ultracold regime, the interaction
of antihydrogen atoms with a surface is governed by the phenomenon of quantum
reflection which results in bouncing of antihydrogen atoms on matter surfaces.
This allows the application of a filtering scheme to increase the precision of
the free fall measurement. In the ultimate limit of smallest vertical
velocities, antihydrogen atoms are settled in gravitational quantum states in
close analogy to ultracold neutrons (UCNs). Positronium is another neutral
system involving antimatter for which free fall under gravity is currently
being investigated at UCL. Building on the experimental techniques under

also be observed in positronium. In this contribution, we review the status of

universe possesses a composite symmetry from global Galileo invariance and
local Lorentz invariance. The observed evolution of the universe expansion rate
at redshift z>1 is in tension with the standard LCDM model, but can be well
predicted by the DEMC model from measurements of only nearby epochs. The so far
most precise measured expansion rate at high z is quite a bit slower than the
expectations from LCDM, but remarkably consistent with that from DEMC. It is
hoped that the DEMC scenario can also help to solve other existing challenges
to cosmology: large scale anomalies in CMB maps and large structures up to
about 10^3 Mpc of a quasar group. The DEMC universe is a well defined
mechanical system. From measurements we can quantitatively evaluate its total
rest energy, present absolute radius and expanding speed.
