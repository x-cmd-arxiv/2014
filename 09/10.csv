surface undergoes a reconstruction that produces a small electron pocket, but
whether there is another, as yet undetected portion to the Fermi surface is
unknown. Establishing the complete topology of the Fermi surface is key to
identifying the mechanism responsible for its reconstruction. Here we report
the discovery of a second Fermi pocket in underdoped YBa2Cu3Oy, detected as a
small quantum oscillation frequency in the thermoelectric response and in the
c-axis resistance. The field-angle dependence of the frequency demonstrates
that it is a distinct Fermi surface and the normal-state thermopower requires
it to be a hole pocket. A Fermi surface consisting of one electron pocket and
two hole pockets with the measured areas and masses is consistent with a
Fermi-surface reconstruction caused by the charge-density-wave order observed
in YBa2Cu3Oy, provided other parts of the reconstructed Fermi surface are
removed by a separate mechanism, possibly the pseudogap.

with variable coefficients and general boundary conditions defined on
rectangular domains is described, based on separable representations of partial
differential operators and the one-dimensional ultraspherical spectral method.
If a partial differential operator is of splitting rank $2$, such as the
operator associated with Poisson or Helmholtz, the corresponding PDE is solved
via a generalized Sylvester matrix equation, and a bivariate polynomial
approximation of the solution of degree $(n_x,n_y)$ is computed in
$\mathcal{O}((n_x n_y)^{3/2})$ operations. Partial differential operators of
splitting rank $\geq 3$ are solved via a linear system involving a block-banded
matrix in $\mathcal{O}(\min(n_x^{3} n_y,n_x n_y^{3}))$ operations. Numerical
examples demonstrate the applicability of our 2D spectral method to a broad
class of PDEs, which includes elliptic and dispersive time-evolution equations.
The resulting PDE solver is written in MATLAB and is publicly available as part
of CHEBFUN. It can resolve solutions requiring over a million degrees of
freedom in under $60$ seconds. An experimental implementation in the Julia
language can currently perform the same solve in $10$ seconds.

is reused by the D2D transmissions, causing mutual interference with the
ongoing cellular transmissions. Massive MIMO is appealing in such a context as
the base station's (BS's) large antenna array can nearly null the D2D-to-BS
interference. The multi-user transmission in massive MIMO, however, may lead to
increased cellular-to-D2D interference. This paper studies the interplay
between massive MIMO and underlaid D2D networking in a multi-cell setting. We
investigate cellular and D2D spectral efficiency under both perfect and
imperfect channel state information (CSI) at the receivers that employ partial
zero-forcing. Compared to the case without D2D, there is a loss in cellular
spectral efficiency due to D2D underlay. With perfect CSI, the loss can be
completely overcome if the number of canceled D2D interfering signals is scaled
with the number of BS antennas at an arbitrarily slow rate. With imperfect CSI,
in addition to pilot contamination, a new asymptotic effect termed underlay
contamination arises. In the non-asymptotic regime, simple analytical lower
bounds are derived for both the cellular and D2D spectral efficiency.

mathematical expediency but poor overall conceptualization of such systems.
This contention is further supported by the poor agreement of experiment in
many such approaches. The notion of momentum as being an intrinsic property of
sound waves is similarly found to be paradoxical. Through an analysis that
includes viscosity and attenuation, we conclude that all acoustic streaming
must arise from vorticity introduced by viscous forces at the driver or other
solid boundaries and that calculations with acoustic stress should be replaced
with ones using a nonlinear correction to the overall pressure field.

problem of each pixel. Each pixel is associated with a label which indicates
whether it is a target or background pixel. The optimal label set for all the
pixels of an image maximizes aposteriori distribution of label configuration
given the pixel intensities. The posterior probability is factored into (or
proportional to) a conditional likelihood of the intensity values and a prior
probability of label configuration. Each of these two probabilities are
computed assuming a Markov Random Field (MRF) on both pixel intensities and
their labels. In particular, this study enforces neighborhood dependency on
both intensity values, by a Simultaneous Auto Regressive (SAR) model, and on
labels, by an Auto-Logistic model. The parameters of these MRF models are
learned from labeled examples. During testing, an MRF inference technique,
namely Iterated Conditional Mode (ICM), produces the optimal label for each
pixel. The detection performance is further improved by incorporating temporal
information through background subtraction. High performances on benchmark
datasets demonstrate effectiveness of this method for IR target detection.

points in $d$ dimensions (with $d \gg 3$) and a pair-potential function (the
{\em kernel} function), we compute a weighted sum of all pairwise kernel
interactions for each point in the set. Direct summation is equivalent to a
(dense) matrix-vector multiplication and scales quadratically with the number
of points. Fast kernel summation algorithms reduce this cost to log-linear or
linear complexity.
  Treecodes and Fast Multipole Methods (FMMs) deliver tremendous speedups by
constructing approximate representations of interactions of points that are far
from each other. In algebraic terms, these representations correspond to
low-rank approximations of blocks of the overall interaction matrix. Existing
approaches require an excessive number of kernel evaluations with increasing
$d$ and number of points in the dataset.
  To address this issue, we use a randomized algebraic approach in which we
first sample the rows of a block and then construct its approximate, low-rank
interpolative decomposition. We examine the feasibility of this approach
theoretically and experimentally. We provide a new theoretical result showing a
tighter bound on the reconstruction error from uniformly sampling rows than the
existing state-of-the-art. We demonstrate that our sampling approach is
competitive with existing (but prohibitively expensive) methods from the
literature. We also construct kernel matrices for the Laplacian, Gaussian, and
polynomial kernels -- all commonly used in physics and data analysis. We
explore the numerical properties of blocks of these matrices, and show that
they are amenable to our approach. Depending on the data set, our randomized
algorithm can successfully compute low rank approximations in high dimensions.

multiples, but their large distances require very high angular resolution to
directly detect the companions at milliarcsecond scales. Aims: Herschel36 is a
young massive system located at 1.3 kpc. It has a combined smallest predicted
mass of 45 M_sun. Multi-epoch spectroscopic data suggest the existence of at
least three gravitationally bound components. Two of them, system Ab, are
tightly bound in a spectroscopic binary, and the third one, component Aa,
orbits in a wider orbit. Our aim was to image and obtain astrometric and
photometric measurements of components Aa and Ab using, for the first time,
long-baseline optical interferometry to further constrain its nature. Methods:
We observed Herschel 36 with the near-infrared instrument AMBER attached to the
ESO VLT Interferometer, which provides an angular resolution of approx. 2 mas.
We used the code BSMEM to perform the interferometric image reconstruction. We
fitted the interferometric observables using proprietary IDL routines and the
code LitPro. Results: We imaged the Aa+Ab components of Herschel 36 in H and K
filters. Component Ab is located at a projected distance of 1.81 mas, at a
position angle of approx. 222 deg. east of north, the flux ratio between
components Aa and Ab is close to one. The small measured angular separation
indicates that system Ab and Ab may be approaching the periastron of their
orbits. These results, only achievable with long-baseline near-infrared
interferometry, constitute the first step toward a thorough understanding of
this massive triple system.

lumped-parameter approach, which is here performed paying particular attention
to the stochastic modeling of the irregular heartbeats and the reduced
contractility of the heart. AF can be here analyzed by means of a wide number
of hemodynamic parameters and avoiding the presence of other pathologies, which
usually accompany AF. Reduced cardiac output with correlated drop of ejection
fraction and decreased amount of energy converted to work by the heart during
blood pumping, as well as higher left atrial volumes and pressures are some of
the most representative results aligned with the existing clinical literature
and here emerging during acute AF. The present modeling, providing new insights
on cardiovascular variables which are difficult to measure and rarely reported

particular attention to the role of bottom friction. In the limit of low bottom
friction, classical theory of geostrophic turbulence predicts an inverse
cascade of kinetic energy in the horizontal with condensation at the domain
scale and barotropization on the vertical. By contrast, in the limit of large
bottom friction, the flow is dominated by ribbons of high kinetic energy in the
upper layer. These ribbons correspond to meandering jets separating regions of
homogenized potential vorticity. We interpret these result by taking advantage
of the peculiar conservation laws satisfied by this system: the dynamics can be
recast in such a way that the imposed mean flow appears as an initial source of
potential vorticity levels in the upper layer. The initial baroclinic
instability leads to a turbulent flow that stirs this potential vorticity field
while conserving the global distribution of potential vorticity levels.
Statistical mechanical theory of the 1-1/2 layer quasi-geostrophic model
predict the formation of two regions of homogenized potential vorticity
separated by a minimal interface. We show that the dynamics of the ribbons
results from a competition between a tendency to reach this equilibrium state,
and baroclinic instability that induces meanders of the interface. These
meanders intermittently break and induce potential vorticity mixing, but the
interface remains sharp throughout the flow evolution. We show that for some
parameter regimes, the ribbons act as a mixing barrier which prevent relaxation
toward equilibrium, favouring the emergence of multiple zonal jets.

using location data. Decision makers in many countries are exploiting spatial
databases for collecting information, analyzing them and planning for the
future. In fact, not every spatial database is suitable for this type of
application. Inaccuracy, imprecision and other deficiencies are present in
location data just as any other type of data and may have a negative impact on
credibility of any action taken based on unrefined information. So we need a
method for evaluating the quality of spatial data and separating usable data
from misleading data which leads to weak decisions. On the other hand, spatial
databases are usually huge in size and therefore working with this type of data
has a negative impact on efficiency. To improve the efficiency of working with
spatial big data, we need a method for shrinking the volume of data. Sampling
is one of these methods, but its negative effects on the quality of data are
inevitable. In this paper we are trying to show and assess this change in
quality of spatial data that is a consequence of sampling. We used this
approach for evaluating the quality of sampled spatial data related to mobile
user trajectories in China which are available in a well-known spatial
database. The results show that sample-based control of data quality will
increase the query performance significantly, without losing too much accuracy.
Based on this results some future improvements are pointed out which will help

the vacuum expectation value of the scalar. If V is expanded in powers of the

sample to belong to more than one cluster, providing more flexibility than
non-fuzzy clustering methods. However, the accuracy of FCM is subject to false
detections caused by noisy records, weak feature selection and low certainty of
the algorithm in some cases. The false detections are very important in some
decision-making application domains like network security and medical
diagnosis, where weak decisions based on such false detections may lead to
catastrophic outcomes. They are mainly emerged from making decisions about a
subset of records that do not provide enough evidence to make a good decision.
In this paper, we propose a method for detecting such ambiguous records in FCM
by introducing a certainty factor to decrease invalid detections. This approach
enables us to send the detected ambiguous records to another discrimination
method for a deeper investigation, thus increasing the accuracy by lowering the
error rate. Most of the records are still processed quickly and with low error
rate which prevents performance loss compared to similar hybrid methods.
Experimental results of applying the proposed method on several datasets from
different domains show a significant decrease in error rate as well as improved
sensitivity of the algorithm.

first-passage probability of the uninformed particle to the target, and we
interpret the speed of the informed particle as a strategic parameter that the
particle tunes to maximize its success. We find that the success probability is
non-monotonic, reaching its maximum at an intermediate speed whose value
increases with the diffusing rate of the uninformed particle. When two
different groups of informed leaders traveling in opposite directions compete,
usually the largest group is the most successful. However, the minority can
reverse this situation and become the most probable winner by following two
different strategies: increasing its attraction strength or adjusting its speed

localized coherent enhancements of optical transition radiation (COTR) that
mask the actual beam profile. Several efforts on mitigation of the effects in
the diagnostics task have been identified. At ASTA we have designed the beam
profiling stations to have mitigation features based on spectral filtering,
scintillator choice, and the timing of the trigger to the digital camera's CCD

bandpass filters centered at 420 nm which also overlap the spectral emissions
of the LYSO:Ce scintillators. By delaying the CCD trigger timing of the

phases via accreting disk-like structures. However, conclusive evidence for
disks has remained elusive for the most massive young objects. This is mainly
due to significant observational challenges. Incisive studies, even targeting
individual objects, are therefore relevant to the progression of the field. NGC
3603 IRS 9A* is a young massive stellar object still surrounded by an envelope
of molecular gas. Previous mid-infrared observations with long-baseline
interferometry provided evidence for a disk of 50 mas diameter at its core.
This work aims at a comprehensive study of the physics and morphology of IRS 9A
at near-infrared wavelengths. New sparse aperture masking interferometry data
taken with NACO/VLT at Ks and Lp filters were obtained and analysed together
with archival CRIRES spectra of the H2 and BrG lines. The calibrated
visibilities recorded at Ks and Lp bands suggest the presence of a partially
resolved compact object of 30 mas at the core of IRS 9A, together with the
presence of over-resolved flux. The spectroastrometric signal of the H2 line
shows that this spectral feature proceeds from the large scale extended
emission (300 mas) of IRS 9A, while the BrG line appears to be formed at the
core of the object (20 mas). This scenario is consistent with the brightness
distribution of the source for near- and mid-infrared wavelengths at various
spatial scales. However, our model suffers from remaining inconsistencies
between SED modelling and the interferometric data. Moreover, the BrG
spectroastrometric signal indicates that the core of IRS 9A exhibits some form
of complexity such as asymmetries in the disk. Future high-resolution
observations are required to confirm the disk/envelope model and to flesh out
the details of the physical form of the inner regions of IRS 9A.

quasars, galaxies, and dark matter halos for redshifts 1 < z < 6. A key
component of these models is that we enforce a self-consistent black hole (BH)
history by tracking both BH mass and BH growth rate at all redshifts. We
connect objects across redshift with a simple constant-number-density
procedure, and choose a fiducial model with a relationship between BH and
galaxy growth rates that is linear and evolves in a simple way with redshift.
Within this fiducial model, we find the quasar luminosity function (QLF) by
calculating an ""intrinsic"" luminosity based on either the BH mass or BH growth
rate, and then choosing a model of quasar variability with either a lognormal
or truncated power-law distribution of instantaneous luminosities. This gives
four model variations, which we fit to the observed QLF at each redshift. With
the best-fit models in hand, we undertake a detailed comparison of the four
fiducial models, and explore changes to our fiducial model of the BH-galaxy
relationship. Each model variation can successfully fit the observed QLF, the
shape of which is generally set by the ""intrinsic"" luminosity at the faint end
and by the scatter due to variability at the bright end. We focus on accounting
for the reasons that physically different models can make such similar
predictions, and on identifying what observational data or physical arguments
are most essential in breaking the degeneracies among models.

also devise novel iterative algorithms for power computation that have many

future generation of weak gravitational lensing surveys like Euclid or LSST.
Direct measurements of the alignment of the projected light distribution of
galaxies in wide field imaging data seem to agree on a contamination at a level
of a few per cent of the shear correlation functions, although the amplitude of
the effect depends on the population of galaxies considered. Given this
dependency, it is difficult to use dark matter-only simulations as the sole
resource to predict and control intrinsic alignments. We report here estimates
on the level of intrinsic alignment in the cosmological hydrodynamical
simulation Horizon-AGN that could be a major source of systematic errors in
weak gravitational lensing measurements. In particular, assuming that the spin
of galaxies is a good proxy for their ellipticity, we show how those spins are
spatially correlated and how they couple to the tidal field in which they are
embedded. We also present theoretical calculations that illustrate and
qualitatively explain the observed signals.

acquire data using multishell (e.g., WU-Minn consortium) and diffusion spectrum
imaging (DSI) schemes (e.g., USC-Harvard consortium). However, these data sets
are not readily accessible to high angular resolution diffusion imaging (HARDI)
analysis methods that are popular in connectomics analysis. Here we introduce a
scheme conversion approach that transforms multishell and DSI data into their
corresponding HARDI representations, thereby empowering HARDI-based analytical
methods to make use of data acquired using non-HARDI approaches. This method
was evaluated on both phantom and in-vivo human data sets by acquiring
multishell, DSI, and HARDI data simultaneously, and comparing the converted
HARDI, from non-HARDI methods, with the original HARDI data. Analysis on the
phantom shows that the converted HARDI from DSI and multishell data strongly
predicts the original HARDI (correlation coefficient > 0.9). Our in-vivo study
shows that the converted HARDI can be reconstructed by constrained spherical
deconvolution, and the fiber orientation distributions are consistent with
those from the original HARDI. We further illustrate that our scheme conversion
method can be applied to HCP data, and the converted HARDI do not appear to
sacrifice angular resolution. Thus this novel approach can benefit all
HARDI-based analysis approaches, allowing greater analytical accessibility to
non-HARDI data, including data from the HCP.

the neutron star 4U 1636-536 during the February 22, 2001 thermonuclear
superburst seen with NASA's Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer (RXTE) that is very
likely produced by a global oscillation mode. The observed frequency is
835.6440 +- 0.0002 Hz (1.43546 times the stellar spin frequency of 582.14323
Hz) and the modulation is well described by a sinusoid ( A + Bsin(p - p0) )
with fractional half-amplitude of B/A = 0.19 +- 0.04% (4-15 keV). The observed
frequency is consistent with the expected inertial frame frequency of a
rotationally-modified surface g-mode, an interfacial mode in the ocean-crust
interface or perhaps an r-mode. Observing an inertial frame frequency--as
opposed to a co-rotating frame frequency--appears consistent with the
superburst's thermal emission arising from the entire surface of the neutron
star, and the mode may become visible by perturbing the local surface
temperature. We briefly discuss the implications of the mode detection for the
neutron star's projected velocity and mass. Our results provide further strong

residue function is obtained as (up to a normalizing factor) the probability
density of some sequences of random variables converging in law after a change
of probability measure. In particular we recover some celebrated results due to
Ellis and Newman on the convergence in law of dependent random variables

localization in either of the two bonds is determined by the energy gap between
the symmetric and asymmetric fundamental transition frequencies. The phase of
the oscillation between the two local bond excitations can be tuned by the
relative phase of the two pulses. The extend of control of bond localization is
limited by the anharmonicity of the potential energy surfaces leading to wave
packet dispersion. This prevents such a simple pulse scheme from being used for
laser-driven bond breaking in the considered example.

the first time, the electricity consumption at individual sites is available on
a near real-time basis. Efficient management of energy resources, electric
utilities, and transmission grids, can be greatly facilitated by harnessing the
potential of this data. The aim of this study is to generate probability
density estimates for consumption recorded by individual smart meters. Such
estimates can assist decision making by helping consumers identify and minimize
their excess electricity usage, especially during peak times. For suppliers,
these estimates can be used to devise innovative time-of-use pricing strategies
aimed at their target consumers. We consider methods based on conditional
kernel density (CKD) estimation with the incorporation of a decay parameter.
The methods capture the seasonality in consumption, and enable a nonparametric
estimation of its conditional density. Using eight months of half-hourly data
for one thousand meters, we evaluate point and density forecasts, for lead
times ranging from one half-hour up to a week ahead. We find that the
kernel-based methods outperform a simple benchmark method that does not account
for seasonality, and compare well with an exponential smoothing method that we
use as a sophisticated benchmark. To gauge the financial impact, we use density
estimates of consumption to derive prediction intervals of electricity cost for
different time-of-use tariffs. We show that a simple strategy of switching
between different tariffs, based on a comparison of cost densities, delivers
significant cost savings for the great majority of consumers.

has a homogeneous chemical composition. In this work, we explore the impact of
different initial carbon profiles of the progenitor WD on the explosion phase
and on synthetic observables in the Chandrasekhar-mass delayed detonation
model. Spectra and light curves are compared to observations to judge the
validity of the model. The explosion phase is simulated using the finite volume
supernova code LEAFS, which is extended to treat different compositions of the
progenitor WD. The synthetic observables are computed with the Monte Carlo
radiative transfer code ARTIS. Differences in binding energies of carbon and
oxygen lead to a lower nuclear energy release for carbon depleted material;
thus, the burning fronts that develop are weaker and the total nuclear energy
release is smaller. For otherwise identical conditions, carbon depleted models
produce less Ni-56. Comparing different models with similar Ni-56 yields shows
lower kinetic energies in the ejecta for carbon depleted models, but only small
differences in velocity distributions and line velocities in spectra. The light
curve width-luminosity relation (WLR) obtained for models with differing carbon
depletion is roughly perpendicular to the observed WLR, hence the carbon mass
fraction is probably only a secondary parameter in the family of SNe Ia.

for example, a nearly-degenerate state in the spectrum that could decay, or be

use this difficulty to motivate the construction of ""deconstructed"" transverse

expanded to neutralino masses that are larger than the difference between the
stop and top masses. In addition, we also discuss how these variables allow for
novel searches of single stop production, in order to directly probe
unconstrained stealth stops in the small stop- and neutralino-mass regime. We
also demonstrate the utility of these variables for generic gluino and stop
searches in all-hadronic final states. Overall, we demonstrate that
deconstructed transverse variables are essential to any search wanting to

Hubble Space Telescope imaging to identify bars, we find that the fraction of
barred active galaxies displays a similar behavior as that of inactive spirals,
declining with redshift from 71% at z~0.3, to 35% at z~0.8. With active
galaxies being typically massive, we compare them against a mass-matched sample
of inactive spirals and show that, while at face value the AGN bar fraction is
slightly higher at all redshifts, we cannot rule out that the bar fractions of
active and inactive galaxies are the same. The presence of a bar has no
influence on the AGN strength, with barred and unbarred active galaxies showing
equivalent X-ray luminosity distributions. From our results, we conclude that
the occurrence and the efficiency of the fueling process is independent of the
large scale structure of a galaxy. The role of bars, if any, may be restricted
to providing the suitable conditions for BH fueling to occur, i.e., bring a
fresh supply of gas to the central 100 pc. At the high-redshift end, we find
that roughly 60% of active disk galaxies are unbarred. We speculate this to be
related with the known dynamical state of disks at higher redshifts---more
gas-rich and prone to instabilities than local spirals---which could also lead
to gas inflows without the need of bars.

gas accretion and BH-BH mergers. Eventually, a strong AGN driven wind starts to
clear up the ISM of dust and gas, damping the star formation and un-obscuring
the line of sight toward the QSO. In this scenario, all the QSOs hosts have
final stellar masses in the range $(4-6)\times 10^{11} M_{sun}$, a factor 3-30

distances, thought to originate from relativistic jets launched at the deaths
of massive stars. They are among the prime candidates to produce the observed
cosmic rays at the highest energies. Recent neutrino data have, however,
started to constrain this possibility in the simplest models with only one
emission zone. In the classical theory of gamma-ray bursts, it is expected that
particles are accelerated at mildly relativistic shocks generated by the
collisions of material ejected from a central engine. We consider neutrino and
cosmic-ray emission from multiple emission regions since these internal
collisions must occur at very different radii, from below the photosphere all
the way out to the circumburst medium, as a consequence of the efficient
dissipation of kinetic energy. We demonstrate that the different messengers
originate from different collision radii, which means that multi-messenger
observations open windows for revealing the evolving GRB outflows.

that allows the locations of all detectors to be simultaneously chosen. We
follow the definition of Raffai et al. on the metric that defines the
suitability of a certain detector network. Given the locations of the component
detectors in the network, we compute a measure of the network's ability to
distinguish the polarization, constrain the sky localization and reconstruct
the parameters of a gravitational wave source. We further define the
`flexibility index' for a possible site location, by counting the number of
multi-detector networks with a sufficiently high Figure of Merit that include
that site location. We confirm the conclusion of Raffai et al., that in terms
of flexibility index as defined in this work, Australia hosts the best
candidate site to build a future generation gravitational wave detector. This
conclusion is valid for either a 3-detector network or a 5-detector network.
For a 3-detector network site locations in Northern Europe display a comparable
flexibility index to sites in Australia. However for a 5-detector network,
Australia is found to be a clearly better candidate than any other location.

in a sample of 10 face-on barred galaxies to constrain the formation and
evolutionary processes of the central regions of disk galaxies. We analyze the
morphological, photometric, and kinematic properties of each bulge. Then, by
using a case-by-case analysis we identify composite bulges and classify every
component into a classical or pseudobulge. In addition, bar-related boxy/peanut
(B/P) structures were also identified and characterised. We find only three
galaxies hosting a single-component bulge (two pseudobulges and one classical
bulge). We find evidence of composite bulges coming in two main types based on
their formation: secular-built and merger- and secular-built. We call
secular-built to composite bulges made of entirely by structures associated
with secular processes such as pseudo bulges, central disks, or B/P bulges. We
find four composite bulges of this kind in our sample. On the other hand,
merger- and secular-built bulges are those where structures with different
formation paths coexist within the same galaxy, i.e., a classical bulge
coexisting with a secular-built structure (pseudobulge, central disk, or B/P).
Three bulges of this kind were found in the sample. We remark on the importance
of detecting kinematic structures such as sigma-drops to identify composite
bulges. A large fraction (80%) of galaxies were found to host sigma-drops or
sigma-plateaus in our sample revealing their high incidence in barred galaxies.
The high frequency of composite bulges in barred galaxies points towards a
complex formation and evolutionary scenario. Moreover, the evidence for
coexisting merger- and secular-built bulges reinforce this idea. We discuss how
the presence of different bulge types, with different formation histories and
timescales, can constrain current models of bulge formation.

rotation with the black hole horizon, along 1-dimensional subspaces - existence
lines - of the Kerr 2-dimensional parameter space. They are zero modes of the
superradiant instability. Non-linear Q-clouds, on the other hand, are also in
synchronous rotation with the black hole horizon; but they exist on a
2-dimensional subspace, delimited by a minimal horizon angular velocity and by
an appropriate existence line, wherein the non-linear terms become irrelevant

scalar bound states around Kerr black holes which, generically, are not zero
modes of the superradiant instability. We describe some physical properties of
Q-clouds, whose backreaction leads to a new family of hairy black holes,
continuously connected to the Kerr family.

Field strengths have been inferred on T Tauri stars themselves and possibly in
the innermost part of the accretion disk, but the strength and morphology of
the field in the bulk of the disk have not been observed. Unresolved
measurements of polarized emission (arising from elongated dust grains aligned
perpendicular to the field) imply average fields aligned with the disks.
Theoretically, the fields are expected to be largely toroidal, poloidal, or a
mixture of the two, which imply different mechanisms for transporting angular
momentum in the disks of actively accreting young stars such as HL Tau. Here we
report resolved measurements of the polarized 1.25 mm continuum emission from
HL Tau's disk. The magnetic field on a scale of 80 AU is coincident with the
major axis (~210 AU diameter) of the disk. From this we conclude that the
magnetic field inside the disk at this scale cannot be dominated by a vertical
component, though a purely toroidal field does not fit the data well either.
The unexpected morphology suggests that the magnetic field's role for the
accretion of a T Tauri star is more complex than the current theoretical
understanding.

driving force of the escape flow (X-ray or EUV), the heating efficiency in
energy-limited evaporation regimes, or both. Although the mass distribution of
the planet populations is barely affected by evaporation, the radius
distribution clearly shows a break at approximately 2 $R_{\oplus}$. We find
that evaporation can lead to a bimodal distribution of planetary sizes (Owen &
Wu 2013) and to an ""evaporation valley"" running diagonally downwards in the
orbital distance - planetary radius plane, separating bare cores from low-mass
planet that have kept some primordial H/He. Furthermore, this bimodal
distribution is related to the initial characteristics of the planetary
populations because low-mass planetary cores can only accrete small primordial
H/He envelopes and their envelope masses are proportional to their core masses.
We also find that the population-wide effect of evaporation is not sensitive to
the heating efficiency of energy-limited description. However, in two extreme
cases, namely without evaporation or with a 100\% heating efficiency in an
evaporation model, the final size distributions show significant differences;
these two scenarios can be ruled out from the size distribution of $Kepler$

<10^(-2.6)-10^(-1.5) M/yr/kpc^2. The implications of these limits for the star
formation law, metal enrichment, and cooling rates of DLAs are examined. By
studying the distribution of impact parameters as a function of SFRs for all

also disfavor a scenario in which the majority of DLAs arise from bright LBGs

synchronization timescale using 9 different star-forming galaxy observations

Surprisingly, this synchronization timescale is a constant, approximately 1.5
Gyr for all combinations of mass and time. We also find that the ratio between
the stellar mass of galaxies turning off star formation and black hole mass of
turnoff quasars is approximately 30:1, much lower than the 500:1 for quiescent
galaxies at low redshift. As a result, we propose a model in which the
star-forming ""main sequence"", analogous quasar behavior, and other observations
form a galactic evolution ""main sequence"", in which star formation occurs
earliest, followed by supermassive black hole accretion, and feedback between

many properties correlate with the strength of optical iron and [OIII]

be the quasar luminosity normalized by the mass of the hole (the Eddington

physics which led to the discovery of \textit{weak values.} We propose that a
quantum phase space structure underlies these profound physical insights in a
unifying manner. For this, we briefly review the Weyl-Wigner and the coherent
state formalisms as well as the inherent symplectic structures of quantum
projective spaces in order to gain a deeper understanding of the weak value
concept.
  We also review Schwinger's finite quantum kinematics so that we may apply
this discrete formalism to understand Aharonov's modular variable concept in a
different manner that has been proposed before in the literature. We discuss
why we believe that this\ is indeed the correct kinematic framework for the
modular variable concept and how this may shine some light on the physical
distinction between quantum dynamical non-locality and the kinematic
non-locality, generally associated with entangled quantum systems.

devoted to several different simplified models and their signatures, including
s-channel and t-channel processes. A common feature of simplified models for DM
is the presence of additional particles that mediate the interactions between
the Standard Model and the particle that makes up DM. We consider these in
detail and emphasize the importance of their inclusion as final states in any

the field, new signatures, and other aspects of the searches themselves. We

white dwarfs (WDs) has been increasingly recognized in the context of type Ia
supernova (SN Ia) single-degenerate model. The expectation that the spin of the
WD can delay the explosion should help the single-degenerate model to be
consistent with the observed properties of most SNe Ia, in particular by
avoiding hydrogen contamination. In this article, we attempt to study the most
prominent single-degenerate supersoft (WD + MS) channel when the rotation of
accreting WDs is considered. We present a detailed binary population synthesis
study to examine the predicted population of SNe Ia for this channel. For our
standard model, we find that 77% of these SNe Ia explode with WD masses which
are low enough to be supported by solid-body rotation (1.378-1.5Msun); this is
a substantially higher proportion than found by previous work. Only 2% have WD
explosion masses >2.0Msun; these require the initial WD mass to be larger than
1.0 Msun. We further discuss the possible origin of the diversity of SNe Ia
from the pre- and post- accretion properties of the WDs in this population. We
also suggest that some SN Ia progenitors with substantial circumstellar
hydrogen, including some apparent type IIn SNe, might be related to WDs which
required support from differential rotation to avoid explosion, since these can
still be accreting from hydrogen-rich donors with a relatively high
mass-transfer rate at the time of the SN explosion.

especially on small mobile devices such as smart phones. However, as
handwriting varies significantly from person to person, it is difficult to
design handwriting recognizers that perform well for all users. A natural
solution is to use machine learning to adapt the recognizer to the user. One
complicating factor is that, as the computer adapts to the user, the user also
adapts to the computer and probably changes their handwriting. This paper
investigates the dynamics of co-adaptation, a process in which both the
computer and the user are adapting their behaviors in order to improve the
speed and accuracy of the communication through handwriting. We devised an
information-theoretic framework for quantifying the efficiency of a handwriting
system where the system includes both the user and the computer. Using this
framework, we analyzed data collected from an adaptive handwriting recognition
system and characterized the impact of machine adaptation and of human
adaptation. We found that both machine adaptation and human adaptation have
significant impact on the input rate and must be considered together in order
to improve the efficiency of the system as a whole.

combined with a velocity dispersion-concentration relation derived from
numerical simulations designed to mimic our group sample, 3.- strong lensing
modeling ($\theta_{E,III}$) of eleven groups (with four new models presented in

of redshift $z$ to investigate possible correlations with L, N, and the
richness-to-luminosity ratio (N/L). We found a correlation between $\theta_{E}$
and $R_A$, but with large scatter. We estimate $\theta_{E,I}$ = (2.2 $\pm$ 0.9)

$R_A$ and $z$, with Log$R_A$ = (0.58$\pm$0.06) - (0.04$\pm$0.1)$z$, suggesting
a possible evolution of the Einstein radius with $z$, as reported previously by

(more luminous and richer groups have greater $R_A$), and a possible

has an important feature, which the author calls -1-phenomenon and tells us
that the coefficients of the Taylor expansion of the $\chi_y$-genus at $y=-1$
have explicit expressions. Hirzebruch's original $\chi_y$-genus can be extended
towards two directions: the pluri-case and the case of elliptic genus. This
paper contains two parts in which we investigate the -1-phenomena in these two
generalized cases respectively and show that in each case there exists a
-1-phenomenon in a suitable sense. Our main results in the first part have an
application, which states that all characteristic numbers (Chern numbers and
Pontrjagin numbers) on manifolds can be expressed, in a very explicit way, in
terms of some rationally linear combination of indices of some elliptic
operators. This gives an analytic interpretation of characteristic numbers and
affirmatively answers a question posed by the author several years ago. The
second part contains our attempt to generalize this -1-phenomenon to elliptic
genus, a modern version of the $\chi_y$-genus. We first extend the elliptic
genus of an almost-complex manifold to a twisted version where an extra complex
vector bundle is involved, and show that it is a weak Jacobi form under some
assumptions. A suitable manipulation on the theory of Jacobi form will produce
new modular forms from this weak Jacobi form and thus much arithmetic
information related to the underlying manifold can be obtained, in which the
-1-phenomenon of the original $\chi_y$-genus is hidden.

of size $n$ has a coloring of the ground set with $\{-1,+1\}$ of discrepancy
$O(\sqrt{n})$. A geometric generalization of this result was given by Gluskin
(see also Giannopoulos) who showed that every symmetric convex body $K\subseteq
R^n$ with Gaussian measure at least $e^{-\epsilon n}$, for a small
$\epsilon>0$, contains a point $y\in K$ where a constant fraction of
coordinates of $y$ are in $\{-1,1\}$. This is often called a partial coloring
result. While both these results were inherently non-algorithmic, recently
Bansal (see also Lovett-Meka) gave a polynomial time algorithm for Spencer's
setting and Rothvo\ss gave a randomized polynomial time algorithm obtaining the
same guarantee as the result of Gluskin and Giannopoulos.
  This paper has several related results. First we prove another constructive
version of the result of Gluskin and Giannopoulos via an optimization of a
linear function. This implies a linear programming based algorithm for
combinatorial discrepancy obtaining the same result as Spencer. Our second
result gives a new approach to obtains partial colorings and shows that every

least $e^{-\epsilon n}$, for a small $\epsilon>0$, contains a point $y\in K$
where a constant fraction of coordinates of $y$ are in $\{-1,1\}$. Finally, we
give a simple proof that shows that for any $\delta >0$ there exists a constant
$c>0$ such that given a body $K$ with $\gamma_n(K)\geq \delta$, a uniformly
random $x$ from $\{-1,1\}^n$ is in $cK$ with constant probability. This gives
an algorithmic version of a special case of the result of Banaszczyk.

strong resonance associated with $4d \rightarrow 5f$ excitation and subsequent
autoionization. This prominent feature in the measured spectrum is the
$4d^95s5f ~^2{\rm P}^{\circ}$ resonance located at (122.139 $\pm$ 0.01)~eV. An

that symmetric models reach synchronization in a stochastic sense: differences
between components $d_{kj}^{(N)}(t)=x_{k}(t)-x_{j}(t)$ have limits in
distribution as $t\rightarrow\infty$. We give conditions of existence of
natural (intrinsic) space scales for large synchronized systems, i.e., we are
looking for such sequences $\{b_{N}\}$ that distribution of
$d_{kj}^{(N)}(\infty)/b_{N}$ converges to some limit as $N\rightarrow\infty$.
It appears that such sequence exists if the Levy process enters a domain of
attraction of some stable law. For Markovian synchronization models based on
$\alpha$-stable Levy processes this results holds for any finite $N$ in the
precise form with $b_{N}=(N-1)^{1/\alpha}$. For non-Markovian models similar
results hold only in the asymptotic sense. The class of limiting laws includes
the Linnik distributions. We also discuss generalizations of these theorems to
the case of non-uniform matrix-based intrinsic scales. The central point of our
proofs is a representation of characteristic functions of $d_{kj}^{(N)}(t)$ via
probability distribution of a superposition of $N$ independent renewal
processes.

parametrizing the impurity Hamiltonian that avoids the mathematically
uncontrolled step of constructing the low energy model system. Instead, the
impurity Hamiltonian is immediately parametrized to recover the self-energy of
the realistic system in the limit of high frequencies or short time. The
effective interactions parametrizing the fictitious impurity Hamiltonian are
local to the embedded regions, and include all the non-local interactions
present in the original realistic Hamiltonian in an implicit way. We show that
this impurity Hamiltonian can lead to excellent total energies and
self-energies that approximate the quantities of the initial realistic system
very well. Moreover, we show that as long as the effective impurity Hamiltonian
parametrization is designed to recover the self-energy of the initial realistic
system for high frequencies, we can expect a good total energy and self-energy.

statistically representative sample is investigated. All nuclear and
morphological subsets found within the original sample of 486 galaxies are
encompassed, but early-type galaxies and galaxies with optical features
characteristic for active galactic nuclei (AGN) are favoured. The results from
the investigation of the properties of our cross-matched sample are overall
consistent with the presence of a large fraction of X-ray - detected
low-luminosity AGN (LLAGN). The X-ray - detected galaxies within our HII and
transition-LINER subsets are of particular interest, as they could harbour
LLAGN missed by optical spectroscopic selection. The properties of these nuclei
are explored by X-ray spectral fitting of available XMM-Newton observations.
The majority of the examined spectra are found to be consistent with a thermal
plasma model and an underlying power-law continuum, and the relative
contributions of a potential LLAGN and of thermal emission to the source
luminosity are presented. In the case that these spectra are not highly
contaminated, as confirmed for some of the nuclei by examining available

Kummer surface of their product and a double cover of it, called the Inose

algebraic geometry and number theory. There are several more associated
elliptic K3 surfaces, obtained through base change of the Inose surface; these
have been previously studied by Kuwata. We give an explicit description of the
geometric Mordell-Weil groups of each of these elliptic surfaces in the generic

describe a method to calculate explicitly a finite index subgroup of the
Mordell-Weil group, which may be saturated to give the full group. Our methods
rely on several interesting group actions, the use of rational elliptic
surfaces, as well as connections to the geometry of low degree curves on cubic
and quartic surfaces. We apply our techniques to compute the full Mordell-Weil
group in several examples of arithmetic interest, arising from isogenous
elliptic curves with complex multiplication, for which these K3 surfaces are
singular.

contributions are studied systematically employing the gauge/string duality.
""Confinement"" in ${\mathcal N}=4$ SU($N$) Super Yang-Mills (SYM) theory could
be achieved kinematically when the theory is defined on a compact space

$\mathbb{S}^3$ at strong coupling is dual to the Hawking-Page phase transition
in the global Anti-de Sitter spacetime. Meantime, all the thermal quantities
and the Polyakov loop achieve significant quadratic contributions. Similar
results can also be obtained at weak coupling. However, when confinement is
induced dynamically through the local dilaton field in the gravity-dilaton
system, these contributions can not be generated consistently. This is in
accordance with the fact that there is no dimension-2 gauge-invariant operator
in the boundary gauge theory. Based on these results, we suspect that quadratic
corrections, and also confinement, should be due to global or non-local effects

selective despite showing only 9-25% of the object. However, these visually
selective signals emerged ~100 ms later for partial versus whole objects. The
processing delays were particularly pronounced in higher visual areas within
the ventral stream, suggesting the involvement of additional recurrent

partial, but not whole, objects. Additionally, computational modeling shows
that the performance of a purely bottom-up architecture is impaired by heavy

of top-down connections. These results provide spatiotemporal constraints on
theories of object recognition that involve recurrent processing to recognize

the proportions of the candidate systems are ~7.0% and 18.0%, respectively. In
this work, we study the formation of mean motion resonance (MMR) systems,
particularly for the planetary configurations near 3:2 and 2:1 MMRs, and we
concentrate on the interplay between the resonant configuration and the
combination of stellar accretion rate, stellar magnetic field, speed of
migration and additional planets. We perform more than 1000 runs by assuming a
system with a solar-like star and three surrounding planets. From the
statistical results, we find that under the formation scenario, the proportions
near 1.5 and 2.0 can reach 14.5% and 26.0%, respectively. In addition, $\dot
M=0.1\times 10^{-8} ~M_\odot ~{\rm yr^{-1}}$ is propitious toward the formation
of 3:2 resonance, whereas $\dot M=2\times 10^{-8} ~M_\odot ~{\rm yr^{-1}}$
contributes to the formation of 2:1 resonance. The speed-reduction factor of
type I migration $f_1\geq 0.3$ facilitates 3:2 MMRs, whereas $f_1\geq 0.1$
facilitates 2:1 MMRs. If additional planets are present in orbits within the
innermost or beyond the outermost planet in a three-planet system, 3:2:1 MMRs
can be formed, but the original systems trapped in 4:2:1 MMRs are not affected
by the supposed planets. In summary, we conclude that this formation scenario

peak and formation of a flat stage on the X-ray profile. We applied the
time-distance plots and pixel wavelet filtration (PWF) methods to obtain
spatio-temporal distribution of wave power variations in SDO/AIA data. To find
magnetic waveguides, we used magnetic field extrapolation of SDO/HMI
magnetograms. The propagation velocity of wave fronts was measured from their
spatial locations at specific times. In correlation curves of the 17 GHz (NoRH)
radio emission we found a monotonous energy amplification of 3-min waves in the
sunspot umbra before the 2012 June 7 flare. This dynamics agrees with an
increase in the wave-train length in coronal loops (SDO/AIA, 171 {\AA})
reaching the maximum 30 minutes prior to the flare onset. A peculiarity of this
flare time profile in soft X-rays (RHESSI, 3-25 keV) is maintaining the
constant level of the flare emission for 10 minutes after the short impulse
phase, which indicates at the energy release continuation. Throughout this
time, we found 30-sec period transverse oscillations of the flare loop in the

the transformation of propagating longitudinal 3-min waves from the sunspot
into the loop transverse oscillations. The magnetic field extrapolation showed
the existence of the magnetic waveguide (loop) connecting the sunspot with the

from $10^{6}$ GeV to $10^{10}$ GeV for the origin of extragalactic ultrahigh
energy cosmic rays assuming that high energy neutrinos are generated by the
photomeson production of protons in the extragalactic universe. The PeV-energy
neutrino flux observed by IceCube gives strong bounds on the
photomeson-production optical depth of protons in their sources and the
intensity of the proton component of extragalactic cosmic rays. The neutrino
flux implies that extragalactic cosmic-ray sources should have the optical
depth greater than $\sim 0.01$ and contribute to more than a few percent of the
observed bulk of cosmic rays at 10 PeV. If the spectrum of cosmic rays from
these extragalactic sources extends well beyond 1 EeV, the neutrino flux
indicates that extragalactic cosmic rays are dominant in the observed total
cosmic-ray flux at 1 EeV and above, favoring the dip transition model of cosmic
rays. The cosmic-ray sources are also required to be efficient neutrino
emitters with the optical depth close to unity in this case. The highest energy
cosmic-ray ($\sim 10^{11}$ GeV) sources should not be strongly evolved with
redshift to account for the IceCube observations, suggesting that any
cosmic-ray radiation scenarios involving distant powerful astronomical objects
with strong cosmological evolution are strongly disfavored. These
considerations conclude that none of the known extragalactic astronomical
objects can be simultaneously a source of both PeV and trans-EeV energy cosmic
rays. We also discuss a possible effect of cosmic-ray propagation in magnetized
intergalactic space to the connection between the observed total cosmic-ray
flux and neutrino flux.

these with theoretical delay time distribution (DTD) models for Type Ia
supernovae (SNe Ia) to derive the distribution of progenitor ages for all SNe
Ia occurring at a given epoch of cosmic time. In actively star-forming
galaxies, the progression of the star formation rate is shallower than a
$t^{-1}$ SN Ia DTD, so mean SN Ia ages peak at the DTD peak in all star-forming
galaxies at all epochs of cosmic history. In passive galaxies which have ceased
star formation through some quenching process, the SN Ia age distribution peaks
at the quenching epoch, which in passive galaxies evolves in redshift to track
the past epoch of major star formation. Our models reproduce the SN Ia rate
evolution in redshift, the relationship between SN Ia stretch and host mass,
and the distribution of SN Ia host masses in a manner qualitatively consistent
with observations. Our model naturally predicts that low-mass galaxies tend to
be actively star-forming while massive galaxies are generally passive,
consistent with observations of galaxy ""downsizing"". Consequently, the mean
ages of SNe Ia undergo a sharp transition from young ages at low host mass to
old ages at high host mass, qualitatively similar to the transition of mean SN
Ia Hubble residuals with host mass. The age discrepancy evolves with redshift
in a manner currently not accounted for in SN Ia cosmology analyses. We thus
suggest that SNe Ia selected only from actively star-forming galaxies will
yield the most cosmologically uniform sample, due to the homogeneity of young
SN Ia progenitor ages at all cosmological epochs.

combined power-law and log-parabolic fits that are improvements. These models
indicate that the optical/UV and X-ray flux variations are mainly driven by
model normalization variations, but the X-ray band flux is also affected by
spectral variations, as parametrized with the model 'curvature' parameter, b.
Overall, the energy at which the emitted power is maximum correlates positively
with the total flux. As the spectrum shifts to higher frequencies, the spectral
'curvature' increase, in contrast to what is expected if a single log-parabolic

$T_c$ of the superconducting NbN films by about 1 K. At low temperatures, a
cross-over of the resistance versus temperature curves of the bilayer and

that photons convert into axion-like particles (ALPs) $\gamma \to a$ inside or
close to a blazar and reconvert into photons $a \to \gamma$ in the Milky Way
magnetic field. This idea has been put forward in 2008 and has attracted a
considerable interest. However, while the probability for the back-conversion
$a \to \gamma$ has been computed in detail (using the maps of the Galatic
magnetic field), regretfully no realistic estimate of the probability for the
conversion $\gamma \to a$ inside a blazar has been performed, in spite of the
fact that the present-day knowledge allows this task to be accomplished in a
reliable fashion. We present a detailed calculation that fills this gap,
considering both types of blazars, namely BL Lac objects (BL Lacs) and flat
spectrum radio quasars (FSRQ) with their specific structural and environmental
properties. We also include the host elliptical galaxy into account. Our
somewhat surprising results show that the conversion probability in BL Lacs is
strongly dependent on the source parameters -- like the position of the
emission region along the jet and the strength of the magnetic field therein --
making it effectivelly unpredictable. On the other hand, the lobes at the
termination of FSRQ jets lead to an effective ""equipartition"" between photons
and ALPs due to its chaotic nature, thereby allowing us to make a clear-cut
prediction. These results are quite important in view of the planned VHE

to the usual 'double-adiabatic' (CGL) model and has the advantage of naturally
reproducing exactly the MHD spectrum in the isotropic limit. As with MHD and
CGL, the SA model neglects the anisotropic perturbed pressure and thus loses
non-local fast-particle stabilisation present in the kinetic approach. Another
interesting aspect of this new approach is that the stabilising terms appear
naturally as separate viscous corrections leaving the isotropic SA closure
unchanged. After verifying the self-consistency of the SA model, we re-derive
the projected linear MHD set of equations required for stability analysis of
tokamaks in the MISHKA code. The cylindrical wave equation is derived
analytically as done previously in the spectral theory of MHD and clear

between 1 and 4 R$_\oplus$. These planets have no analogues in our own Solar
System, providing an unprecedented opportunity to understand the range and
distribution of planetary compositions allowed by planet formation and
evolution. A precise mass measurement is usually required to constrain the
possible composition of an individual super-Earth-sized planet, but these
measurements are difficult and expensive to make for the majority of Kepler
planet candidates. Fortunately, adopting a statistical approach helps us to
address this question without them. In particular, we apply hierarchical
Bayesian modeling to a subsample of Kepler planet candidates that is complete
for $P< 25$ days and $R_{pl}>1.2$ R$_\oplus$ and draw upon interior structure
models which yield radii largely independent of mass by accounting for the
thermal evolution of a gaseous envelope around a rocky core. Assuming the
envelope is dominated by hydrogen and helium, we present the current-day
composition distribution of the sub-Neptune-sized planet population and find
that H+He envelopes are most likely to be $\sim 1\%$ of these planets' total
mass with an intrinsic scatter of $\pm 0.5$ dex. We address the gaseous/rocky
transition and illustrate how our results do not result in a one-to-one
relationship between mass and radius for this sub-Neptune population;
accordingly, dynamical studies which wish to use Kepler data must adopt a
probabilistic approach to accurately represent the range of possible masses at
a given radius.

Multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) can perform such association

is generally very powerful for detecting association but there are situations,
such as when a genetic variant is associated with all the traits, where MANOVA
may not have any detection power. We investigate the behavior of MANOVA, both
theoretically and using simulations, and derive the conditions where MANOVA
loses power. Based on our findings, we propose a unified score-based test
statistic USAT that can perform better than MANOVA in such situations and
nearly as well as MANOVA elsewhere. Our proposed test reports an approximate
asymptotic p-value for association and is computationally very efficient to
implement at a GWAS level. We have studied through extensive simulation the

was shown by Chambolle & Pock in \cite{CP11} and also by Shefi & Teboulle in
\cite{ST14} that CPA and variants are closely related to preconditioned
versions of the popular alternating direction method of multipliers
(abbreviated as ADM). In this paper, we further clarify this connection and
show that CPAs generate exactly the same sequence of points with the so-called
linearized ADM (abbreviated as LADM) applied to either the primal problem or
its Lagrangian dual, depending on different updating orders of the primal and
the dual variables in CPAs, as long as the initial points for the LADM are
properly chosen. The dependence on initial points for LADM can be relaxed by
focusing on cyclically equivalent forms of the algorithms. Furthermore, by
utilizing the fact that CPAs are applications of a general weighted proximal
point method to the mixed variational inequality formulation of the KKT system,
where the weighting matrix is positive definite under a parameter condition, we
are able to propose and analyze inertial variants of CPAs. Under certain
conditions, global point-convergence, nonasymptotic $O(1/k)$ and asymptotic
$o(1/k)$ convergence rate of the proposed inertial CPAs can be guaranteed,

gained by introducing the inertial extrapolation step via experimental results

predetermine the right number of topics, which is a key parameter of most topic
models. Conventionally, automatic selection of this parameter is done through
either statistical model selection (e.g., cross-validation, AIC, or BIC) or
Bayesian nonparametric models (e.g., hierarchical Dirichlet process). These
methods either rely on repeated runs of the inference algorithm to search
through a large range of parameter values which does not suit the mining of big
data, or replace this parameter with alternative parameters that are less
intuitive and still hard to be determined. In this paper, we explore to
""eliminate"" this parameter from a new perspective. We first present a
nonparametric treatment of the PLSA model named nonparametric probabilistic
latent semantic analysis (nPLSA). The inference procedure of nPLSA allows for
the exploration and comparison of different numbers of topics within a single
execution, yet remains as simple as that of PLSA. This is achieved by
substituting the parameter of the number of topics with an alternative
parameter that is the minimal goodness of fit of a document. We show that the
new parameter can be further eliminated by two parameter-free treatments:
either by monitoring the diversity among the discovered topics or by a weak
supervision from users in the form of an exemplar topic. The parameter-free
topic model finds the appropriate number of topics when the diversity among the
discovered topics is maximized, or when the granularity of the discovered
topics matches the exemplar topic. Experiments on both synthetic and real data
prove that the parameter-free topic model extracts topics with a comparable
quality comparing to classical topic models with ""manual transmission"". The
quality of the topics outperforms those extracted through classical Bayesian
nonparametric models.

evolution and dynamics on the structural properties of young massive (3x10^4

solar metallicity). Metallicity drives the mass loss by stellar winds and
supernovae (SNe), with SCs losing more mass at high metallicity. We have
simulated three sets of initial conditions, with different initial relaxation
timescale. We find that the evolution of the half-mass radius of SCs depends on
how fast two-body relaxation is with respect to the lifetime of massive stars.
If core collapse is slow in comparison with stellar evolution, then mass loss
by stellar winds and SNe is the dominant mechanism driving SC evolution, and
metal-rich SCs expand more than metal-poor ones. In contrast, if core collapse
occurs on a comparable timescale with respect to the lifetime of massive stars,
then SC evolution depends on the interplay between mass loss and three-body
encounters: dynamical heating by three-body encounters (mass loss by stellar
winds and SNe) is the dominant process driving the expansion of the core in
metal-poor (metal-rich) SCs. As a consequence, the half-mass radius of
metal-poor SCs expands more than that of metal-rich ones. We also find core

is constructed from the three-point correlation function of the phase of the

information in the non-linear and non-Gaussian regime. We show that, in
perturbation theory, the line correlation is sensitive to the coupling kernel
F_2, which governs the non-linear gravitational evolution of the density field.
We compare our analytical expression with results from numerical simulations
and find a 1-sigma agreement for separations r<30 Mpc/h. Fitting formulae for
the power spectrum and the non-linear coupling kernel at small scales allow us
to extend our prediction into the strongly non-linear regime where we find a
1-sigma agreement with the simulations for r<2 Mpc/h. We discuss the advantages
of the line correlation relative to standard statistical measures like the
bispectrum. Unlike the latter, the line correlation is independent of the bias,
in the regime where the bias is local and linear. Furthermore, the variance of
the line correlation is independent of the Gaussian variance on the modulus of
the density field. This suggests that the line correlation can probe more
precisely the non-linear regime of gravity, with less contamination from the
power spectrum variance.

The importance of radiation to the physical structure of protoplanetary
disks cannot be understated. However, protoplanetary disks evolve with time,
and so to understand disk evolution and by association, disk structure, one
should solve the combined and time-dependent equations of radiation
hydrodynamics.
  Methods. We implement a new implicit radiation solver in the AZEuS adaptive
mesh refinement magnetohydrodynamics fluid code. Based on a hybrid approach
that combines frequency-dependent ray-tracing for stellar irradiation with
non-equilibrium flux limited diffusion, we solve the equations of radiation
hydrodynamics while preserving the directionality of the stellar irradiation.
The implementation permits simulations in Cartesian, cylindrical, and spherical
coordinates, on both uniform and adaptive grids.
  Results. We present several hydrostatic and hydrodynamic radiation tests
which validate our implementation on uniform and adaptive grids as appropriate,
including benchmarks specifically designed for protoplanetary disks. Our
results demonstrate that the combination of a hybrid radiation algorithm with
AZEuS is an effective tool for radiation hydrodynamics studies, and produces
results which are competitive with other astrophysical radiation hydrodynamics
codes.

been performed for a wide range of temperatures and pressures at a wavelength
of 403 nm and at a 90 degrees scattering angle. Measurements of the
Rayleigh-Brillouin spectral scattering profile were conducted at high
signal-to-noise ratio for all three species, yielding high-quality spectra
unambiguously showing the small differences between scattering in air, and its
constituents N2 and O2. Comparison of the experimental spectra with
calculations using the Tenti S6 model, developed in 1970s based on linearized
kinetic equations for molecular gases, demonstrates that this model is valid to
high accuracy. After previous measurements performed at 366 nm, the Tenti S6
model is here verified for a second wavelength of 403 nm. Values for the bulk
viscosity for the gases are derived by optimizing the model to the
measurements. It is verified that the bulk viscosity parameters obtained from
previous experiments at 366 nm, are valid for wavelengths of 403 nm. Also for
air, which is treated as a single-component gas with effective gas transport
coefficients, the Tenti S6 treatment is validated for 403 nm as for the
previously used wavelength of 366 nm, yielding an accurate model description of
the scattering profiles for a range of temperatures and pressures, including
those of relevance for atmospheric studies. It is concluded that the Tenti S6
model, further verified in the present study, is applicable to LIDAR
applications for exploring the wind velocity and the temperature profile
distributions of the Earth's atmosphere. Based on the present findings,
predictions can be made on the spectral profiles for a typical LIDAR

contribution from low-mass asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars. As a case
study, we analyze the SED of R71. We compiled all the available photometric and
spectroscopic observational fluxes from various telescopes for a wide
wavelength range (0.36 -- 250\,$\mu$m). We determined the dust composition from
the spectroscopic data, and derived the ejected dust mass, dust mass-loss rate,
and other dust shell properties by modeling the SED of R71. We noted nine
spectral features in the dust shell of R71 by analyzing Spitzer spectroscopic
data. Among these, we identified three new crystalline silicate features. We
computed our model spectrum by using 3D radiative transfer code MCMax. Our
model calculation shows that dust is dominated by amorphous silicates, with
some crystalline silicates, metallic iron, and a very tiny amount of polycyclic
aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) molecules. The presence of both silicates and PAHs
indicates that the dust has a mixed chemistry. We derived a dust mass of 0.01
M$_\odot$, from which we arrive at a total ejected mass of $\approx$ 5
M$_\odot$. This implies a time-averaged dust mass-loss rate of
2.5$\times$10$^{-6}$ M$_\odot$\,yr$^{-1}$ with an explosion about 4000 years
ago. We assume that the other five confirmed dusty LBVs in the LMC loose mass
at a similar rate, and estimate the total contribution to the mass budget of
the LMC to be $\approx$ 10$^{-5}$ M$_\odot$\,yr$^{-1}$, which is comparable to
the contribution by all the AGB stars in the LMC. Based on our analysis on R71,
we speculate that LBVs as a class may be an important dust source in the ISM of
the LMC.

that it would be possible to throw a charged test particle into the near
extremal rotating black hole and make it go past the extremality i.e. turn Kerr
black hole into the Kerr-Newmann naked singularity. Typically in an
astrophysical scenario black holes are believed to be surrounded by a magnetic
field. Magnetic field although small, affects motion of charged particles
drastically due to the large Lorentz force, as the electromagnetic force is
much stronger that the gravity. Thus a test magnetic field can affect the
process of destroying black holes and restore the cosmic censorship in the
astrophysical context. We show that a test magnetic field would act as a cosmic
censor beyond a certain threshold value. We try to gauge the magnitude of the
magnetic field by comparing its energy density with that of the change in the
curvature induced by the test particle. We find that the magnetic field
required in only as strong as or slightly stronger as compared to the value for
which its effect of the background geometry is comparable to the tiny
backreaction as that of the test particle. In such a case however one has to
take take into account effect of the magnetic field on the background geometry,
which is difficult to implement in the absence of any exact near-extremal
rotating magnetized black hole solutions. We argue that magnetic field would

X-ray spectral variations. Its X-ray energy spectrum is characterized by a
strong soft excess emission, an extremely deep iron K-edge structure at ~7 keV,
and a putative iron L-line/edge feature at ~1 keV. We have found that the
energy spectrum of 1H0707-495 in 0.5-10 keV is successfully explained by a
""variable double partial covering model"" where the original continuum spectrum,
which is composed of the soft multi-color disk blackbody component and the hard
power-law component, is partially covered by two ionized absorption layers with
different ionization states and the same partial covering fraction. The
lower-ionized and thicker absorption layer primarily explains the iron K-edge
feature, and the higher-ionized and thinner absorption layer explains the
L-edge feature. We have discovered that the observed significant
intensity/spectral variation within a ~ day is mostly explained by only
variation of the partial covering fraction. In our model, the intrinsic
luminosity and spectral shape are hardly variable within a ~ day, while some
intrinsic variability above 3 keV is recognized. This is consistent with the
picture that the multi-color disk blackbody spectrum is almost invariable in
this timescale, and the hard power-law component is more variable. We propose
that the observed spectral variation of 1H0707-495 is caused by three
physically independent variations with different timescales; (1) intrinsic
luminosity variation over days, (2) variation of partial covering fraction at a
timescale of hours, and (3) small intrinsic hard component variation above 3
keV in a timescale of hours or less.

Understanding the spectral evolution of blazars in selected frequency ranges,
as well as multi-frequency correlations in various types of blazar sources, is
of a primary importance for constraining the blazar physics. Here we present
the results of a long-term optical monitoring of a sample of 30 blazars of the
BL Lac type. We study the optical color-magnitude correlation patterns emerging
in the analyzed sample, and compare the optical properties of the targets with
the high-energy gamma-ray and high-frequency radio data. The optical
observations were carried out in R and B filters using ATOM telescope. Each
object was observed during at least 20 nights in the period 2007-2012. We find
significant global color-magnitude correlations in 40 % of the sample. The
sources which do not display any clear chromatism often do exhibit
bluer-when-brighter (bwb) behavior but only in isolated shorter time intervals.
We also discovered spectral state transitions at optical wavelengths in several
sources. Finally, we find that the radio, optical, and gamma-ray luminosities
of the sources obey almost linear correlations, which seem however induced, at
least partly, by the redshift dependance, and may be also affected by
non-simultaneousness of the analyzed dataset. We argue that the observed bwb
behavior is intrinsic to the jet emission regions, at least for some of the
analyzed blazars, rather than resulting from the contamination of the measured
flux by the starlight of host galaxies. We also conclude that the significance
of color-magnitude scalings does not correlate with the optical color, but
instead seems to depend on the source luminosity, in a sense that these are the
lowest-luminosity BL Lac objects which display the strongest correlations.

the core of quantum information and communications technology (Q-ICT). These
photons are conventionally generated by spontaneous parametric down conversion
(SPDC), which is a probabilistic process, and hence occurs at a limited rate,
which restricts wider applications of Q-ICT. To increase the rate, one had to
excite SPDC by higher pump power, while it inevitably produced more unwanted
multi-photon components, harmfully degrading quantum interference
visibility.Here we solve this problem by using recently developed 10 GHz
repetition-rate-tunable comb laser, combined with a group-velocity-matched
nonlinear crystal, and superconducting nanowire single photon detectors. They
operate at telecom wavelengths more efficiently with less noises than
conventional schemes, those typically operate at visible and near infrared

detectors. We could show high interference visibilities, which are free from
the pump-power induced degradation. Our laser, nonlinear crystal, and detectors
constitute a powerful tool box, which will pave a way to implementing quantum

presence of inconsistencies, either internal within an experiment or external

fit, different definitions of a conservative PDF set, that is, a PDF set based
on a maximally consistent dataset, have been introduced. However, these
approaches are typically affected by theory biases in the selection of the
dataset. In this contribution, after a brief overview of recent NNPDF
developments, we propose a new, fully objective, definition of a conservative
PDF set, based on the Bayesian reweighting approach. Using the new NNPDF3.0
framework, we produce various conservative sets, which turn out to be mutually
in agreement within the respective PDF uncertainties, as well as with the
global fit. We explore some of their implications for LHC phenomenology,
finding also good consistency with the global fit result. These results provide
a non-trivial validation test of the new NNPDF3.0 fitting methodology, and
indicate that possible inconsistencies in the fitted dataset do not affect
substantially the global fit PDFs.

degenerate equilibrium in a Hamiltonian system with two degrees of freedom. We
assume that the unperturbed fixed point has two purely imaginary eigenvalues
and a double zero one. It is well known that an one-parametric unfolding of the
corresponding Hamiltonian can be described by an integrable normal form. The
normal form has a normally elliptic invariant manifold of dimension two. On
this manifold, the truncated normal form has a separatrix loop. This loop
shrinks to a point when the unfolding parameter vanishes. Unlike the normal
form, in the original system the stable and unstable trajectories of the
equilibrium do not coincide in general. The splitting of this loop is
exponentially small compared to the small parameter. This phenomenon implies
non-existence of single-round homoclinic orbits and divergence of series in the
normal form theory. We derive an asymptotic expression for the separatrix
splitting. We also discuss relations with behaviour of analytic continuation of
the system in a complex neighbourhood of the equilibrium.

star formation activity in bulges towards stronger bars, although not

different stages of the secular process and many other factors may contribute
to the complexity of the secular evolution. In addition, barred galaxies with
intense star formation in bars tend to have active star formation in their

receivers to have prior side information about the source. We establish the
model's information-theoretic limits in two operational modes: In Mode 1, the
helper BSs are given information about the channel codeword transmitted by the
main BS, and in Mode 2 they are provided correlated side information about the
source. Optimal codes for Mode 1 use \emph{hash-and-forward coding} at the
helper BSs; while, in Mode 2, optimal codes use source codes from Wyner's
\emph{helper source-coding problem} at the helper BSs. We prove the optimality
of both approaches by way of a new list-decoding generalisation of [8, Thm. 6],
and, in doing so, show an operational duality between Modes 1 and 2.

that the lattice dynamics of Bi(111) is quite robust and appears converged
already for slabs as thin as 6 bilayers. Changes of interatomic couplings are
confined mostly to the first two bilayers, resulting in super-bulk modes with
frequencies higher than the optic bulk spectrum, and in an enhanced density of
states at lower frequencies for atoms in the first bilayer. Electronic states
of the surface band related to the outer part of the hole Fermi surfaces
exhibit a moderate electron-phonon coupling of about 0.45, which is larger than
the coupling constant of bulk Bi. States at the inner part of the hole surface
as well as those forming the electron pocket close to the zone center show much
increased couplings due to transitions into bulk projected states near
Gamma_bar. For these cases, the state dependent Eliashberg functions exhibit
pronounced peaks at low energy and strongly deviate in shape from a Debye-like
spectrum, indicating that an extraction of the coupling strength from measured
electronic self-energies based on this simple model is likely to fail.

the surfaces of icy dust grains in dark molecular clouds at low temperatures
(10-20 K), involving hydrogenation reactions of oxygen allotropes. As a result
of the large abundances of molecular hydrogen and atomic oxygen in these
regions, the reaction H2 + O has been proposed to contribute significantly to
the formation of water as well. However, gas phase experiments and
calculations, as well as solid-phase experimental work contradict this
hypothesis. Here, we use precisely executed temperature programmed desorption
(TPD) experiments in an ultra-high vacuum setup combined with kinetic Monte
Carlo simulations to establish an upper limit of the water production starting
from H2 and O. These reactants are brought together in a matrix of CO2 in a
series of (control) experiments at different temperatures and with different
isotopological compositions. The amount of water detected with the quadrupole
mass spectrometer upon TPD is found to originate mainly from contamination in
the chamber itself. However, if water is produced in small quantities on the
surface through H2 + O, this can only be explained by a combined classical and
tunneled reaction mechanism. An absolutely conservative upper limit for the
reaction rate is derived with a microscopic kinetic Monte Carlo model that
converts the upper limit into a maximal possible reaction rate. Incorporating
this rate into simulations run for astrochemically relevant parameters, shows
that the upper limit to the contribution of the reaction H2 + O in OH, and
hence water formation, is 11% in dense interstellar clouds. Our combined
experimental and theoretical results indicate however, that this contribution
is likely to be much lower.

a diversity of methods designed to extract their large-scale structure from
data. Unfortunately, many of these methods yield diverging descriptions of the
same network, making both the comparison and understanding of their results a
difficult challenge. A possible solution to this outstanding issue is to shift
the focus away from ad hoc methods and move towards more principled approaches
based on statistical inference of generative models. As a result, we face
instead the more well-defined task of selecting between competing generative
processes, which can be done under a unified probabilistic framework. Here, we
consider the comparison between a variety of generative models including
features such as degree correction, where nodes with arbitrary degrees can
belong to the same group, and community overlap, where nodes are allowed to
belong to more than one group. Because such model variants possess an
increasing number of parameters, they become prone to overfitting. In this
work, we present a method of model selection based on the minimum description
length criterion and posterior odds ratios that is capable of fully accounting
for the increased degrees of freedom of the larger models, and selects the best
one according to the statistical evidence available in the data. In applying
this method to many empirical unweighted networks from different fields, we
observe that community overlap is very often not supported by statistical
evidence and is selected as a better model only for a minority of them. On the
other hand, we find that degree correction tends to be almost universally
favored by the available data, implying that intrinsic node proprieties (as
opposed to group properties) are often an essential ingredient of network
formation.

rate of the stored electrons due to the elastic coulomb scattering of electrons

due to this elastic scattering depends upon the shape factor which is governed
by the shape of the vacuum chamber. In this paper, analytical expressions for
the shape factor for a rectangular and an elliptical vacuum chamber as a
function of longitudinal position along the circumference in a storage ring are
derived using an approach in which the position of electrons at the focusing
quadrupole is transformed to the location of defocusing quadrupole and vice
versa to define the parts of the vacuum chamber, where the loss of electrons
takes place at the location of quadrupoles. The expressions available in the
literature are for the average shape factors. The expression of shape factor
for a rectangular chamber derived in this paper are similar to the expression
for average shape factor quoted in the literature, whereas a new expression for
elliptical shape of vacuum chamber having no resemblance with the available
expression for average shape factor is obtained. A comparative study of shape
factors at each scattering location in the ring obtained from derived
expressions and with the existing expressions are reported using Indus-2
lattice parameters for rectangular and elliptical shapes of the chamber. A
comparison of average shape factors for these two shapes using derived as well

to migrate between the habitats. With random migration, we are able to

diversity decreases with increasing migration rates, whereas local diversity
can increase in case of a low level of dispersal. Moreover, we find that the
total biomasses in the different patches become similar even when species
composition remains different. With adaptive migration, we observe species
compositions that differ considerably between patches and contain species that

are used in the general relativity literature. Two of them are the most common,
the static form and the cosmological (exponentially expanding) form. The
staticity and non-stationarity of these two different forms are traced back to
the noncomoving and comoving nature of the corresponding coordinate systems. In
this paper using the quasi-Maxwell form of the Einstein field equations and a
definition of static spacetimes based upon them, we look at these two different
forms of the same solution from a new perspective which classifies them as a
special case in a general one-parameter family of solutions. Specifically it is
proved that, {\it irrespective of the spacetime symmetry, a one-element perfect
fluid in any frame noncomoving with the fluid could be the source of a static
spacetime, only if its equation of state is that of a dark fluid namely $p =
-\rho = const.$}. These static solutions, which include the well-known de
Sitter spacetime, are called de Sitter-type spacetimes. To exemplify we
consider static axially and cylindrically symmetric de Sitter-type spacetimes
and their dynamic (cosmological) versions. It is shown how despite the
seemingly natural expectation based on the presence of $\Lambda$ as their only
parameter, the nonspherical expansions of these genuinely different solutions
should be expected indeed. To the best of our knowledge the dynamic version of
the cylindrically symmetric de Sitter-type spacetime is introduced here for the
first time. Finally it is noted that the identification of the geometric term
$\Lambda g_{ij}$ with a perfect fluid with equation of state $p = -\rho =
const.$, although mathematically consistent, obscures the crucial role of the
(dark) fluid's velocity in defining a preferred (comoving) coordinate system in
de Sitter-type spacetimes.

dominated by late-type galaxies, but also contains a significant number of
early- type galaxies, particularly in the dwarf regime. We present further
evidence for the existence of several subgroups in the cluster, consistent with
previous findings. The early-type fraction is found to correlate with the mass
of the subgroup. We also investigate environmental effects by comparing the
properties of the Ursa Major early-type dwarf galaxies to those of the Virgo
cluster. In contrast to the Virgo, the red sequence of the Ursa Major cluster
is only sparsely populated in the optical and ultraviolet colour-magnitude
relations. It also shows a statistically significant gap between -18 < Mr < -17
mag, i.e. the Ursa Major cluster lacks early-type dwarf galaxies at the bright
end of their luminosity function. We discover that the majority of early-type
dwarf galaxies in the Ursa Major cluster have blue cores with hints of recent
or ongoing star formation. We suggest that gravitational tidal interactions can
trigger central blue star forming regions in early-type dwarfs. After that,
star formation would only fade completely when the galaxies experience ram
pressure stripping or harassment, both of which are nearly absent in the Ursa
Major cluster.

distribution enables the independent measurement of several observables as a
function of the dilepton invariant mass. The plethora of observables so
obtained enable unique tests of the standard model contributions. We start by
writing the most general parametric form of the standard model amplitude for
$B\to K^*\ell^+\ell^-$ taking into account comprehensively all contributions

approximations, however, innocuous. The violation of this relation will provide
a smoking gun signal of new physics. We use the $1 \text{fb}^{-1}$ LHC$b$ data

non-linear Stark shifts and the electron localization within the conductive
region and contacts. Deep I(V)-curve well is formed when the aromatic molecule,
containing intramolecular hydrogen bond, is connected to each lead by the
double-branch contacts. This effect occurs at the same voltage where a
single-junction case exhibits only a flat step in the current characteristics.
The multipeak oscillations arise from the mutual effect of the Stark shifts
located at the electron-rich contacts and parts of the molecule - this opens
the route for further tailoring the desired properties.

development of community system becomes a trend. Meanwhile, smart mobile
devices and cloud computing technology are increasingly used in intelligent
information systems; however, smart mobile devices such as smartphone and smart
pad, also known as thin clients, limited by either their capacities (CPU,
memory or battery) or their network resources, do not always meet users'
satisfaction in using mobile services. Mobile cloud computing, in which
resource-rich virtual machines of smart mobile device are provided to a
customer as a service, can be terrific solution for expanding the limitation of
real smart mobile device, but the resources utilization rate is low and the
information cannot be shared easily. To address the problems above, this paper
proposes an information system for intelligent community, which is composed of
thin clients, wide band network and cloud computing servers. On one hand, the
thin clients with the characteristics of energy efficiency, high robustness and
high computing capacity can efficiently avoid the problems encountered in the
PC architecture and mobile devices. On the other hand, the cloud computing
servers in the proposed information system solve the problems of resource
sharing barriers. Finally, the system is built in real environments to evaluate
the performance. We deploy the proposed system in a community with more than
2000 residents, and it is demonstrated that the proposed system is robust and
efficient.

unprecedented energy, in order to extend the frontiers of high-energy particle
physics. During the first very successful running period in 2010--2013, the LHC
was routinely storing protons at 3.5--4 TeV with a total beam energy of up to
146 MJ, and even higher stored energies are foreseen in the future. This puts
extraordinary demands on the control of beam losses. An un-controlled loss of
even a tiny fraction of the beam could cause a superconducting magnet to
undergo a transition into a normal-conducting state, or in the worst case cause
material damage. Hence a multi-stage collimation system has been installed in
order to safely intercept high-amplitude beam protons before they are lost
elsewhere. To guarantee adequate protection from the collimators, a detailed
theoretical understanding is needed. This article presents results of numerical
simulations of the distribution of beam losses around the LHC that have leaked
out of the collimation system. The studies include tracking of protons through
the fields of more than 5000 magnets in the 27 km LHC ring over hundreds of
revolutions, and Monte-Carlo simulations of particle-matter interactions both
in collimators and machine elements being hit by escaping particles. The
simulation results agree typically within a factor 2 with measurements of beam
loss distributions from the previous LHC run. Considering the complex
simulation, which must account for a very large number of unknown
imperfections, and in view of the total losses around the ring spanning over 7
orders of magnitude, we consider this an excellent agreement. Our results give
confidence in the simulation tools, which are used also for the design of
future accelerators.

confirm the substellar nature of the companion, making SDSS J141126.20+200911.1
the first eclipsing white dwarf/brown dwarf binary known. We measure a (white
dwarf model dependent) mass and radius for the brown dwarf companion of $M_{2}
= 0.050 \pm 0.002$ $M_{\odot}$ and $R_{2} = 0.072 \pm 0.004$ $M_{\odot}$,
respectively. The lack of a robust detection of the companion light in the
$z'$-band eclipse constrains the spectral type of the companion to be later
than L5. Comparing the NIR photometry to the expected white dwarf flux reveals
a clear $K_s$-band excess, suggesting a spectral type in the range L7-T1.
  The radius measurement is consistent with the predictions of evolutionary
models, and suggests a system age in excess of three Gyr. The low companion
mass is inconsistent with the inferred spectral type of L7-T1, instead
predicting a spectral type nearer T5. This indicates that irradiation of the
companion in SDSS J1411 could be causing a significant temperature increase, at
least on one hemisphere.

  Sensing and Estimation",,,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In cognitive radio systems, employing sensing-based spectrum access
strategies, secondary users are required to perform channel sensing in order to
detect the activities of primary users. In realistic scenarios, channel sensing
occurs with possible errors due to miss-detections and false alarms. As another
challenge, time-varying fading conditions in the channel between the secondary
transmitter and the secondary receiver have to be learned via channel
estimation. In this paper, performance of causal channel estimation methods in
correlated cognitive radio channels under imperfect channel sensing results is
analyzed, and achievable rates under both channel and sensing uncertainty are
investigated. Initially, cognitive radio channel model with channel sensing
error and channel estimation is described. Then, using pilot symbols, minimum
mean square error (MMSE) and linear-MMSE (L-MMSE) estimation methods are
employed at the secondary receiver to learn the channel fading coefficients.
Expressions for the channel estimates and mean-squared errors (MSE) are
determined, and their dependencies on channel sensing results, and pilot symbol
period and energy are investigated. Since sensing uncertainty leads to
uncertainty in the variance of the additive disturbance, channel estimation
strategies and performance are interestingly shown to depend on the sensing
reliability. It is further shown that the L-MMSE estimation method, which is in
general suboptimal, performs very close to MMSE estimation. Furthermore,
assuming the channel estimation errors and the interference introduced by the
primary users as zero-mean and Gaussian distributed, achievable rate
expressions of linear modulation schemes and Gaussian signaling are determined.
Subsequently, the training period, and data and pilot symbol energy allocations
are jointly optimized to maximize the achievable rates for both signaling
schemes.

achieved by combining data from observatories located in both the northern and
southern hemispheres. To this end, a joint analysis using data recorded at the
Telescope Array and the Pierre Auger Observatory above $10^{19}$ eV is
presented in this work. The resulting multipolar expansion of the flux of
cosmic rays allows us to perform a series of anisotropy searches, and in
particular to report on the angular power spectrum of cosmic rays above
$10^{19}$ eV. No significant deviation from isotropic expectations is found
throughout the analyses performed. Upper limits on the amplitudes of the dipole
and quadrupole moments are derived as a function of the direction in the sky,
varying between 7% and 13% for the dipole and between 7% and 10% for a
symmetric quadrupole.

for this theory are derived using a method which avoids varying the square-root

metrics are proportional to each other and find that it can solve the equations
provided that one parameter in the action is fixed. In this case, the
proportional metrics as well as the effective metric that couples to matter
solve Einstein's equations of general relativity including a matter source.
Around these backgrounds we derive the quadratic action for perturbations,
diagonalized into a massive and a massless spin-2 fluctuation. We find that
only the massless spin-2 mode interacts with matter; a result which is
independent of the remaining parameters of the theory.

MWe tokamak reactor with a major radius of 3.3 m, a minor radius of 1.1 m, and
an on-axis magnetic field of 9.2 T. ARC has rare earth barium copper oxide
(REBCO) superconducting toroidal field coils, which have joints to enable
disassembly. This allows the vacuum vessel to be replaced quickly, mitigating
first wall survivability concerns, and permits a single device to test many
vacuum vessel designs and divertor materials. The design point has a plasma
fusion gain of Q_p~13.6, yet is fully non-inductive, with a modest bootstrap
fraction of only ~63%. Thus ARC offers a high power gain with relatively large
external control of the current profile. This highly attractive combination is
enabled by the ~23 T peak field on coil with newly available REBCO
superconductor technology. External current drive is provided by two innovative
inboard RF launchers using 25 MW of lower hybrid and 13.6 MW of ion cyclotron
fast wave power. The resulting efficient current drive provides a robust,
steady state core plasma far from disruptive limits. ARC uses an all-liquid
blanket, consisting of low pressure, slowly flowing fluorine lithium beryllium
(FLiBe) molten salt. The liquid blanket is low-risk technology and provides
effective neutron moderation and shielding, excellent heat removal, and a
tritium breeding ratio >= 1.1. The large temperature range over which FLiBe is
liquid permits blanket operation at 900 K with single phase fluid cooling and a
high-efficiency Brayton cycle, allowing for net electricity generation when
operating ARC as a Pilot power plant.

magnetically confined fusion (MCF) experiments. The development of such
techniques is essential to ensure tolerable heat loads on components in large
MCF fusion devices, and is necessary for their development into economically
successful power plants. Bayesian probability theory is used to rigorously
formulate the problem and to provide a formal solution. Accurate but pragmatic
methods are developed to estimate triggering probabilities, and are illustrated
with experimental data. These allow results from experiments to be
quantitatively assessed, and rigorously quantified conclusions to be formed.
Example applications include assessing whether triggering of ELMs is a
statistical or deterministic process, and the establishment of thresholds to
ensure that ELMs are reliably triggered.

a clear picture of how to implement some EHRs that will be trusted by health
consumers. The participants (n=240) were surveyed on computer usage, EHRs

make EHRs more secure. A number of chi-square tests (p<0.05) showed there was a
strong relationship among the variable of age, computer use, EHRs knowledge and
concerns for privacy and security. The study showed that there was a small
difference of 8.5% between those who think EHRs are safer than paper records
and those who think otherwise. The general observation of the study was that in
order to make EHRs successful, then the issue of security, and health consumer

Consequently, we have obtained the various field equations for unified

shown that the difference between the octonion cold dark matter (OCDM) and the
