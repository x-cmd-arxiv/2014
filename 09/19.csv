Monge-Ampere equation, which combines equidistribution of a given scalar
density function with optimal transport. It does not involve explicit use of a
metric tensor M, although such a tensor must exist for the method, and an
interesting question to ask is whether or not the alignment produced by the
metric gives an anisotropic mesh. For model problems with a linear feature and
with a radially symmetric feature, we derive the exact form of the metric M,
which involves expressions for its eigenvalues and eigenvectors. The
eigenvectors are shown to be orthogonal and tangential to the feature, and the
ratio of the eigenvalues (corresponding to the level of anisotropy) is shown to
depend, both locally and globally, on the value of the density function and the
amount of curvature. We thereby demonstrate how the optimal transport method
produces an anisotropic mesh along a given feature while equidistributing a
suitably chosen scalar density function. Numerical results are given to verify
these results and to demonstrate how the analysis is useful for problems
involving more complex features, including for a non-trivial time dependant

Fabrikant et al., PODC 2003) or maximum (MAX-game, Demaine et al., PODC 2007)
of distances from $v$ to all other nodes plus the prices of the bought edges.
The above papers show the existence of Nash equilibria as well as upper and
lower bounds for the prices of anarchy and stability. In several subsequent
papers, these bounds were improved for a wide range of prices \alpha. In this
paper, we extend these models by incorporating quality-of-service aspects: Each
edge cannot only be bought at a fixed quality (edge length one) for a fixed
price \alpha. Instead, we assume that quality levels (i.e., edge lengths) are
varying in a fixed interval [\beta,B], 0 < \beta <= B. A node now cannot only
choose which edge to buy, but can also choose its quality x, for the price
p(x), for a given price function p. For both games and all price functions, we
show that Nash equilibria exist and that the price of stability is either
constant or depends only on the interval size of available edge lengths. Our
main results are bounds for the price of anarchy. In case of the SUM-game, we
show that they are tight if price functions decrease sufficiently fast.

hydrogel are capable of preventing adhesive forces from pulling a hydrogel into
close contact with a surface against which it is pressed. The proposed
mechanism for lubrication or surface protection suggests a possible mechanism
for protecting the cornea from a contact lens, which is held against the eye by
Laplace pressure. This mechanism, however, is only able to keep a gel coated
surface from sticking to a surface against which it is pressed, if the gel and

shown here that, in a general L--T model, the $t_B(r)$ can be chosen so that
the blueshift-generating region is hidden before the recombination time, where
the L--T model does not apply. The rest of the paper is devoted to
investigating blueshifts in one specific L--T model, called L--T$(t_B)$ -- the
one that duplicates the luminosity distance vs. redshift relation of the

blueshift-generating region in the L--T$(t_B)$ spacetime is determined.
Profiles of redshift/blueshift along several rays intersecting the past light

matched to Friedmann is considered, and profiles of redshift/blueshift in such
a composite model are calculated. The requirement of invisibility of blueshifts
makes the L--T$(t_B)$ model astrophysically unacceptable if it should apply
back to the recombination time, but does not ""rule out"" a general L--T model --
it only puts limits on $\dril {t_B} r$.

gateway to the high-speed network. The goal of a node $v$ is to minimize its

distances from $v$ to all other nodes plus a fixed price $\alpha > 0$ if it
decides to be a gateway. Between gateways the communication distance is $0$,
and gateways also improve other nodes' distances by behaving as shortcuts. For
the SUM-game, we show that for $\alpha \leq n-1$, the price of anarchy is
$\Theta(n/\sqrt{\alpha})$ and in this range equilibria always exist. In range
$\alpha \in (n-1,n(n-1))$ the price of anarchy is $\Theta(\sqrt{\alpha})$, and
for $\alpha \geq n(n-1)$ it is constant. For the MAX-game, we show that the

or else $1$. Given a graph with girth of at least $4\alpha$, equilibria always
exist. Concerning the dynamics, both the SUM-game and the MAX-game are not

the erased Fourier coefficients of a function with respect to a frame by
appropriate linear combinations of the non-erased coefficients. We prove that
if a minimal redundancy condition is satisfied bridging can always be done to
make the reduced error operator nilpotent of index 2 using a bridge set of
indices no larger than the cardinality of the erasure set. This results in
perfect reconstruction of the erased coefficients in one final matricial step.
We also obtain a new formula for the inverse of an invertible partial
reconstruction operator. This leads to a second method of perfect
reconstruction from frame and sampling erasures in finitely many steps. This
gives an alternative to the bridging method for many (but not all) cases. The
methods we use employ matrix techniques only of the order of the cardinality of
the erasure set, and are applicable to rather large finite erasure sets for
infinite frames and sampling schemes as well as for finite frame theory. Some
new classification theorems for frames are obtained and some new methods of
measuring redundancy are introduced based on our bridging theory.

  $\lambda$ giving the collapse rate of an isolated nucleon in a superposition
of two spatially separated states and, more generally, characterizing the
collapse time for any physical situation. CSL is experimentally testable, since
it predicts some behavior different from that predicted by standard quantum

imparted to particles. Here we consider energy given to trapped ultra-cold
atoms. Since these are the coldest samples under experimental investigation, it
is worth inquiring how they are affected by the CSL heating mechanism. We
examine the CSL heating of a BEC in contact with its thermal cloud. Of course,
other mechanisms also provide heat and also particle loss. From varied data on

into account proximity effects and spin-flip correlations within the quantum
dot. It is shown that the zero-bias transmittance for the co-tunneling between
the ferromagnetic leads presents a dip whose height depends on the relative
orientation of the magnetizations. When the superconductor is coupled to the
system, electron-hole correlations between different spin states leads to a
resonance in the place of the dip appearing in the transmittance. Such an
effect is accompanied by two anti-resonances explained by a leakage of
conduction channels from the co-tunneling to the Andreev transport. In the
non-equilibrium regime, correlations within the quantum dot introduce a
dependence of the resonance condition on the finite bias applied to the
ferromagnetic leads. However, it is still possible to observe signatures of the

$\mathbf{a}_{ij}$ is bounded, has zero mean, and its variance is given by
$\sigma_{i}\sigma_{j}$, for a given sequence of positive real numbers
$\Psi=\{\sigma_{i} , i\in\mathbb{N}\}$. Hence, the matrix of variances
$V_n=\left( \mbox{Var}( \mathbf{a}_{ij}) \right)_{i,j=1}^n$ has rank one for
all $n$. We show that the empirical spectral distribution of the symmetric
random matrix $\mathbf{A}_n(\Psi)$ $ =$ $ \left(
\mathbf{a}_{ij}/\sqrt{n}\right)_{i,j=1}^n$ converges weakly (and with
probability one) to a deterministic limiting spectral distribution which we
fully characterize by providing closed-form expressions for its limiting
spectral moments in terms of the sequence $\Psi$. Furthermore, we propose a
hierarchy of semidefinite programs to compute upper and lower bound on the
expected spectral norm of $\mathbf{A}_n$, for both finite $n$ and the limit
$n\to\infty$.

buildings or objects in query photos and to provide the user with relevant
information on them. With their increasing coverage of the world's landmark
buildings and objects, Internet photo collections are now being used as a
source for building such systems in a fully automatic fashion. This process
typically consists of three steps: clustering large amounts of images by the
objects they depict; determining object names from user-provided tags; and
building a robust, compact, and efficient recognition index. To this date,
however, there is little empirical information on how well current approaches
for those steps perform in a large-scale open-set mining and recognition task.
Furthermore, there is little empirical information on how recognition
performance varies for different types of landmark objects and where there is
still potential for improvement. With this paper, we intend to fill these gaps.
Using a dataset of 500k images from Paris, we analyze each component of the
landmark recognition pipeline in order to answer the following questions: How
many and what kinds of objects can be discovered automatically? How can we best
use the resulting image clusters to recognize the object in a query? How can
the object be efficiently represented in memory for recognition? How reliably
can semantic information be extracted? And finally: What are the limiting
factors in the resulting pipeline from query to semantics? We evaluate how
different choices of methods and parameters for the individual pipeline steps
affect overall system performance and examine their effects for different query
categories such as buildings, paintings or sculptures.

limitations when used for parameter estimation, and is often much slower than
non-sampling inference methods. SAME (State Augmentation for Marginal
Estimation) \cite{Doucet99,Doucet02} is an approach to MAP parameter estimation
which gives improved parameter estimates over direct Gibbs sampling. SAME can
be viewed as cooling the posterior parameter distribution and allows annealed
search for the MAP parameters, often yielding very high quality (lower loss)
estimates. But it does so at the expense of additional samples per iteration
and generally slower performance. On the other hand, SAME dramatically
increases the parallelism in the sampling schedule, and is an excellent match
for modern (SIMD) hardware. In this paper we explore the application of SAME to
graphical model inference on modern hardware. We show that combining SAME with
factored sample representation (or approximation) gives throughput competitive
with the fastest symbolic methods, but with potentially better quality. We
describe experiments on Latent Dirichlet Allocation, achieving speeds similar
to the fastest reported methods (online Variational Bayes) and lower
cross-validated loss than other LDA implementations. The method is simple to

$\Omega_{\Lambda_0}=0.7$ and $H_0=70 \; \mbox{km} \; {\mbox{s}}^{-1} \;

densities $\gamma$ and $\gamma^\ast$ obtained from the red and blue FDF

luminosity distance $d_{\scriptscriptstyle L}$, galaxy area distance
$d_{\scriptscriptstyle G}$ and redshift distance $d_z$ were plotted against
their respective number densities to calculate $D$ by linear fitting. It was
found that the FDF galaxy distribution is characterized by two single fractal
dimensions at successive distance ranges. Two straight lines were fitted to the
data, whose slopes change at $z \approx 1.3$ or $z \approx 1.9$ depending on
the chosen cosmological distance. The average fractal dimension calculated

continuous vector fields. One such phenomenon - Zeno executions - is
characterized by an infinite number of discrete events or transitions occurring
over a finite interval of time. This phenomenon is not necessarily undesirable
and may indeed be used to capture physical phenomena. In this paper, we examine
the problem of proving the existence and stability of zero executions. Our
approach is to develop a polynomial-time algorithm - based on the
sum-of-squares methodology - for verifying the stability of a Zeno execution.
We begin by stating Lyapunov-like theorems for local Zeno stability based on
existing results. Then, for hybrid systems with polynomial vector fields, we
use polynomial Lyapunov functions and semialgebraic geometry
(Positivstellensatz results) to reduce the local Lyapunov-like conditions to a
convex feasibility problem in polynomial variables. The feasibility problem is
then tested using an algorithm for sum-of-squares programming - SOSTOOLS. We
also extend these results to hybrid system with parametric uncertainty, where
the uncertain parameters lie in a semialgebriac set. We also provide several
examples illustrating the use of our technique.

establish that hypoellipticity of its generator and confinement of the system
is equivalent to the existence of a unique normalised steady state. These two
conditions also imply hypocoercivity, i.e. exponential convergence of the
solution to equilibrium.
  Since the standard entropy method does not apply to degenerate parabolic
equations, we develop a new modified entropy method (based on a modified,
non-degenerate entropy dissipation-like functional) to prove this exponential
decay in relative entropy (logarithmic till quadratic) - with a sharp rate.
Furthermore, we compute the spectrum and eigenspaces of the generator as well
as flow-invariant manifolds of Gaussian functions.
  Next, we extend our method to kinetic Fokker-Planck equations with a class of
non-quadratic potentials. And, finally, we apply this new method to
non-symmetric, uniformly parabolic Fokker-Planck equations with linear drift.
At least in 2D this always yields the sharp exponential envelopes for the
entropy function. In this case, we obtain even a sharp multiplicative constant
in the decay estimate for the non-symmetric semigroup.

neutrino-heated matter, because these plumes most effectively seed the growth
of Rayleigh-Taylor (RT) instabilities at the C+O/He and He/H composition-shell
interfaces after the passage of the SN shock. The extent of radial mixing,
global asymmetry of the metal-rich ejecta, RT-induced fragmentation of initial
plumes to smaller-scale fingers, and maximal Ni and minimal H velocities do not
only depend on the initial asphericity and explosion energy (which determine
the shock and initial Ni velocities) but also on the density profiles and
widths of C+O core and He shell and on the density gradient at the He/H
transition, which lead to unsteady shock propagation and the formation of
reverse shocks. Both RSG explosions retain a great global metal asymmetry with
pronounced clumpiness and substructure, deep penetration of Ni fingers into the
H-envelope (with maximum velocities of 4000-5000 km/s for an explosion energy

these properties (maximum Ni speeds up to ~3500 km/s), the 20 Msun BSG develops
a much more roundish geometry without pronounced metal fingers (maximum Ni

of dark matter particles around Supermassive Black Hole (BH) binaries. We show
that in the hierarchical (in separation) three-body problem, one of the BHs and
a dark matter particle form an inner binary. Gravitational perturbations from
the BH companion, on a much wider orbit, can cause the dark matter particle to
reach extremely high eccentricities and even get accreted onto the BH, by what
is known as the Eccentric Kozai-Lidov (EKL) mechanism. We show that this may
produce a torus-like configuration for the dark matter distribution around the
less massive member of the BH binary. We first consider an Intermediate BH
(IMBH) in the vicinity of our Galactic Center, which may be a relic of a past
minor merger. We show that if the IMBH is close enough (i.e., near the stellar
disk) the EKL mechanism is very efficient in exciting the eccentricity of dark
matter particles in near-polar configurations to extremely high values where
they are accreted by the IMBH. We show that this mechanism is even more
effective if the central BH grows in mass, where we have assumed adiabatic
growth. Since near-polar configurations are disrupted, a torus-like shape is
formed. We also show that this behavior is also likely to be relevant for
Supermassive BH binaries. We suggest that if the BHs are spinning, the accreted
dark matter particles may linger in the ergosphere and thereby may generate
self-annihilations and produce an indirect signature of potential interest.

band-selected catalogs in the GOODS-North and the COSMOS-wide fields, in order
to obtain one of the most accurate and unbiased understanding to date of the
stellar mass growth over the cosmic history. We show, for the first time, that
stacking also provides a powerful tool to determine the dispersion of a
physical correlation and describe our method called ""scatter stacking"" that may
be easily generalized to other experiments. We demonstrate that galaxies of all
masses from z=4 to 0 follow a universal scaling law, the so-called main
sequence of star-forming galaxies. We find a universal close-to-linear slope of
the logSFR-logM* relation with evidence for a flattening of the main sequence
at high masses (log(M*/Msun) > 10.5) that becomes less prominent with
increasing redshift and almost vanishes by z~2. This flattening may be due to
the parallel stellar growth of quiescent bulges in star-forming galaxies.
Within the main sequence, we measure a non varying SFR dispersion of 0.3 dex.
The specific SFR (sSFR=SFR/M*) of star-forming galaxies is found to
continuously increase from z=0 to 4. Finally we discuss the implications of our
findings on the cosmic SFR history and show that more than 2/3 of present-day
stars must have formed in a regime dominated by the main sequence mode. As a
consequence we conclude that, although omnipresent in the distant Universe,
galaxy mergers had little impact in shaping the global star formation history

non-barred galaxies. Thus we find no compelling evidence that large-scale bars
directly fuel AGN at 0.2<z<1.0. This result, coupled with previous results at
z=0, implies that moderate-luminosity AGN have not been preferentially fed by
large-scale bars since z=1. Furthermore, given the low bar fractions at z>1,
our findings suggest that large-scale bars have likely never directly been a
dominant fueling mechanism for supermassive black hole growth.

straightforward calculation of the element of $H^{d+1}(G, U(1))$ corresponding
to physically meaningful models such as non-linear sigma models with a theta

those in which the symmetry cannot be represented locally on the edge. With

covering an area of 17 to 52 deg$^{2}$. From the observations we derive
Euclidean-normalized differential source counts. The 62 MHz source counts agree
with previous GMRT 153 MHz and VLA 74 MHz differential source counts, scaling
with a spectral index of $-0.7$. We find that a spectral index scaling of
$-0.5$ is required to match up the LOFAR 34 MHz source counts. This result is
also in agreement with source counts from the 38 MHz 8C survey, indicating that
the average spectral index of radio sources flattens towards lower frequencies.
We also find evidence for spectral flattening using the individual flux
measurements of sources between 34 and 1400 MHz and by calculating the spectral
index averaged over the source population. To select ultra-steep spectrum
($\alpha < -1.1$) radio sources, that could be associated with massive high
redshift radio galaxies, we compute spectral indices between 62 MHz, 153 MHz
and 1.4 GHz for sources in the Bo\""otes field. We cross-correlate these radio
sources with optical and infrared catalogues and fit the spectral energy
distribution to obtain photometric redshifts. We find that most of these
ultra-steep spectrum sources are located in the $ 0.7 \lesssim z \lesssim 2.5$

models feature an approximate $Z_2^e \times Z_2^\mu \times Z_2^\tau$ flavor
symmetry, which forbids 2-body nucleon decay and ensures that flavor
antisymmetric $L L E^c$ couplings are the only non-negligible L-violating
operators. Nucleons are predicted to decay through $N \rightarrow K e \mu \nu$
and $n \rightarrow e \mu \nu$; the resulting bounds on RPV couplings are rather
mild. Novel collider phenomenology arises because the superpartners can decay
through both L-violating and B-violating couplings. This can lead to, for
example, final states with high jet multiplicity and multiple leptons of
different flavor, or a spectrum in which depending on the superpartner, either
B or L violating decays dominate. BLRPV can also provide a natural setting for
displaced $\tilde{\nu} \rightarrow \mu e$ decays, which evade many existing
collider searches for RPV supersymmetry.

variety of inflationary scenarios. Through exploring in detail the weighting of
shape properties in the calculation of the halo bias and halo mass function we
show how they probe a broad range of configurations, beyond those in the
squeezed limit, that can help distinguish between shapes with similar large
scale bias behaviors.
  We assess the impact, on constraints for a diverse set of non-Gaussian
shapes, of galaxy clustering information in the mildly non-linear regime, and
surveys that span multiple redshifts and employ different galactic tracers of
the dark matter distribution. Fisher forecasts are presented for a Euclid-like
spectroscopic survey of H$\alpha$-selected emission line galaxies (ELGs) using
recent revisions of the expected H$\alpha$ luminosity function, and a DESI-like
survey, of luminous red galaxies (LRGs) and [O-II] doublet-selected ELGs, in
combination with Planck-like CMB temperature and polarization data.
  While ELG samples provide better probes of shapes that are divergent in the
squeezed limit, LRG constraints, centered below $z<1$, yield stronger
constraints on shapes with scale-independent large-scale halo biases, such as
the equilateral template. The ELG and LRG samples provide complementary
degeneracy directions for distinguishing between different shapes. If the
Gaussian galaxy bias is constrained to better than a percent level, such as can
be determined from the galaxy bispectrum or weak lensing, then the LSS and CMB
data could provide complementary constraints that will enable differentiation
of bispectra with distinct theoretical origins but with similar large scale,
squeezed-limit properties.

lattice in the presence of a composite charge order proposed for the pseudogap
state in underdoped cuprates. This composite charge order preserves discrete
translational symmetries, and is ""chiral-nematic"" in the sense that it breaks
time-reversal symmetry, mirror symmetries in $x$ and $y$ directions, and $C_4$
lattice rotation symmetry. The Kerr angle $\theta_K$ in $C_4$-symmetric system
is proportional to the antisymmetric component of the anomalous Hall
conductivity $\sigma_{xy}-\sigma_{yx}$. We show that this result holds when
$C_4$ symmetry is broken. We show that in order for $\sigma_{xy}$ and
$\sigma_{yx}$ to be non-zero the mirror symmetries in $x$ and $y$ directions
have to be broken, and that for $\sigma_{xy}-\sigma_{yx}$ to be non-zero
time-reversal symmetry has to be broken. The chiral-nematic charge order
satisfies all these conditions, such that a non-zero signal in a polar Kerr
effect experiment is symmetry allowed. We further show that to get a non-zero
$\theta_K$ in a one-band spin-fluctuation scenario, in the absence of disorder,
one has to extend the spin-mediated interaction to momenta away from
$(\pi,\pi)$ and has to include particle-hole asymmetry. Alternatively, in the
presence of disorder one can get a non-zero $\theta_K$ from impurity
scattering: either due to skew scattering (with non-Gaussian disorder) or due
to particle-hole asymmetry in case of Gaussian disorder. The impurity analysis
in our case is similar to that in earlier works on Kerr effect in $p_x+ip_y$
superconductor, however in our case the magnitude of $\theta_K$ is enhanced by
the flattening of the Fermi surface in the ""hot"" regions which mostly
contribute to charge order.

angular momentum of the flow, and perhaps of the black hole, nearly aligned

which is also used to calibrate the scaling relation which allows single-epoch
(SE) mass determination based on AGN luminosity and the width of different
emission lines. The SE mass obtained from CIV$(1549 {\rm\AA})$ line shows a
large spread around mean values, due to complex structure and gas dynamics of
the relevant emission region. Direct RM measures of CIV exist for only 6 AGNs
of low luminosity and redshift, and only one luminous quasar (Kaspi et al
2007). We have collected since 2003 photometric and spectroscopic observations
of PG1247+267, the most luminous quasar ever analyzed for RM. We provide light
curves for the continuum and for CIV$(1549 {\rm\AA})$ and
CIII]$(1909{\rm\AA})$, and measures of the reverberation time lags based on the
SPEAR method (Zu et al. 2011). The sizes of the line emission regions are in a
ratio $R_{CIII]}/R_{CIV}\sim 2$, similar to the case of Seyfert galaxies,
indicating for the first time a similar ionization stratification in a luminous
quasar and low luminosity nuclei. Due to relatively small broad line region
size and relatively narrow line widths, we estimate a small mass and an
anomalously high Eddington ratio. We discuss the possibility that either the

gravitational lensing may be in part responsible of the result.

  with Shrinkage Estimators","body 21 pages, 11 figures",,,,"stat.ME","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A recent interest in resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging
(rsfMRI) lies in subdividing the human brain into anatomically and functionally
distinct regions of interest. For example, brain parcellation is often used for
defining the network nodes in connectivity studies. While inference has
traditionally been performed on group-level data, there is a growing interest
in parcellating single subject data. However, this is difficult due to the low
signal-to-noise ratio of rsfMRI data, combined with typically short scan
lengths. A large number of brain parcellation approaches employ clustering,
which begins with a measure of similarity or distance between voxels. The goal
of this work is to improve the reproducibility of single-subject parcellation
using shrinkage estimators of such measures, allowing the noisy
subject-specific estimator to ""borrow strength"" in a principled manner from a
larger population of subjects. We present several empirical Bayes shrinkage
estimators and outline methods for shrinkage when multiple scans are not
available for each subject. We perform shrinkage on raw intervoxel correlation
estimates and use both raw and shrinkage estimates to produce parcellations by
performing clustering on the voxels. Our proposed method is agnostic to the
choice of clustering method and can be used as a pre-processing step for any
clustering algorithm. Using two datasets---a simulated dataset where the true
parcellation is known and is subject-specific and a test-retest dataset
consisting of two 7-minute rsfMRI scans from 20 subjects---we show that
parcellations produced from shrinkage correlation estimates have higher
reliability and validity than those produced from raw estimates. Application to
test-retest data shows that using shrinkage estimators increases the
reproducibility of subject-specific parcellations of the motor cortex by up to
30%.

The quenched disorder causes the Hall angle to become drive-dependent in the

consequence of random drift. A famous result in population genetics asserts
that the rate, $K$, at which these substitutions accumulate in the population
coincides with the mutation rate, $u$, at which they arise in individuals:
$K=u$. This identity enables genetic sequence data to be used as a ""molecular
clock"" to estimate the timing of evolutionary events. While the molecular clock
is known to be perturbed by selection, it is thought that $K=u$ holds very
generally for neutral evolution. Here we show that asymmetric spatial
population structure can alter the molecular clock rate for neutral mutations,
leading to either $K<u$ or $K>u$. Deviations from $K=u$ occur because mutations
arise unequally at different sites and have different probabilities of fixation
depending on where they arise. If birth rates are uniform across sites, then $K
\leq u$. In general, $K$ can take any value between 0 and $Nu$. Our model can
be applied to a variety of population structures. In one example, we
investigate the accumulation of genetic mutations in the small intestine. In
another application, we analyze over 900 Twitter networks to study the effect
of network topology on the fixation of neutral innovations in social evolution.

matter. Despite their importance, their similarities and differences remain
elusive, especially at high density. We identify dynamical and structural
signatures which distinguish the gel and glass transitions in a colloidal model
system of hard and ""sticky"" spheres. Gelation is induced by crossing the
gas-liquid phase-separation line and the resulting rapid densification of the
colloid-rich phase leads to a sharp change in dynamics and local structure.
Thus, we find that gelation is first-order-like and can occur at much higher
densities than previously thought: far from being low-density networks, gels
have a clear ""thermodynamic"" definition which nevertheless leads to a
non-equilibrium state with a distinct local structure characteristic of a
rapidly quenched glass. In contrast, approaching the glass transition, the
dynamics slow continuously accompanied by the emergence of local five-fold
symmetric structure. Our findings provide a general thermodynamic, kinetic, and
structural basis upon which to distinguish gelation from vitrification.

unique information about the explosion in supernovae. The 56Ni freshly-produced
in the supernova powers the optical light curve, as it emits gamma-rays upon
its radioactive decay to 56Co and then 56Fe. Gamma-ray lines from 56Co decay
are expected to become directly visible through the overlying white dwarf
material several weeks after the explosion, as they progressively penetrate the
overlying material of the supernova envelope, diluted as it expands. The lines
are expected to be Doppler-shifted or broadened from the kinematics of the 56Ni
ejecta. With the SPI spectrometer on INTEGRAL and using an improved
instrumental background method, we detect the two main lines from 56Co decay at
847 and 1238 keV from SN2014J at 3.3 Mpc, significantly Doppler-broadened, and
at intensities (3.65+/-1.21) 10^-4 and (2.27+/-0.69) 10^-4 ph cm^-2s^-1,
respectively, at brightness maximum. We measure their rise towards a maximum
after about 60-100 days and decline thereafter. The intensity ratio of the two
lines is found consistent with expectations from 56Co decay (0.62+/-0.28 at
brightness maximum, expected is 0.68). We find that the broad lines seen in the
late, gamma-ray transparent phase are not representative for the early
gamma-ray emission, and rather notice the emission spectrum to be complex and
irregular until the supernova is fully transparent to gamma-rays, with
progressive uncovering of the bulk of 56Ni. We infer that the explosion
morphology is not spherically symmetric, both in the distribution of 56Ni and
of the unburnt material which occults the 56Co emission. Comparing light curves

In characteristic zero, we also provide formulas for the generators of iterated

previous work of Herzog, who gave formulas for the socle generators of any

57a has been previously shown to contain enhanced quantities of warm molecular
hydrogen consistent with shock and/or turbulent heating. Our observations show
that HCG 57d has strong [C II] emission compared to L$_{\rm FIR}$ and weak
CO(1-0), while in HCG 57a, both the [C II] and CO(1-0) are strong. HCG 57a lies
at the upper end of the normal distribution of [C II]/CO and [C II]/FIR ratios,
and its far-IR cooling supports a low density warm diffuse gas that falls close
to the boundary of acceptable PDR models. However, the power radiated in the [C
II] and warm H$_2$ emission have similar magnitudes, as seen in other
shock-dominated systems and predicted by recent models. We suggest that
shock-heating of the [C II] is a viable alternative to photoelectric heating in
violently disturbed diffuse gas. The existence of shocks is also consistent
with peculiar CO kinematics in the galaxy, indicating highly non-circular
motions are present. These kinematically disturbed CO regions also show
evidence of suppressed star formation, falling a factor of 10-30 below normal
galaxies on the Kennicutt-Schmidt relation. We suggest that the peculiar
properties of both galaxies are consistent with a highly dissipative off-center
collisional encounter between HCG 57d and 57a, creating ring-like morphologies
in both systems. Highly dissipative gas-on-gas collisions may be more common in
dense groups because of the likelihood of repeated multiple encounters. The
possibility of shock-induced SF suppression may explain why a subset of these
HCG galaxies have been found previously to fall in the mid-infrared green
valley.

a low-mass binary model where the mass of the central star of the disk is 5.4

the adaptation of dynamic mode decomposition (DMD), an algorithm originally

DMD is a modal decomposition algorithm that describes high-dimensional dynamic
data using coupled spatial-temporal modes; the resulting analysis combines key
features of performing principal components analysis (PCA) in space and power
spectral analysis in time. The algorithm scales easily to very large numbers of
simultaneously acquired measurements. We validated the DMD approach on
sub-dural electrode array recordings from human subjects performing a known

datasets of complex objects. Data analysis of tree data objects is an exciting
research area with interesting questions and challenging problems. This thesis
focuses on tree oriented statistical methodologies, and algorithms for solving
related mathematical optimization problems.
  This research is motivated by the goal of analyzing a data set of images of
human brain arteries. The approach we take here is to use a novel
representation of brain artery systems as points in phylogenetic treespace. The
treespace property of unique global geodesics leads to a notion of geometric
center called a Fr\'echet mean. For a sample of data points, the Fr\'echet
function is the sum of squared distances from a point to the data points, and
the Fr\'echet mean is the minimizer of the Fr\'echet function.
  In this thesis we use properties of the Fr\'echet function to develop an
algorithmic system for computing Fr\'echet means. Properties of the Fr\'echet
function are also used to show a sticky law of large numbers which describes a
surprising stability of the topological tree structure of sample Fr\'echet
means at that of the population Fr\'echet mean. We also introduce
non-parametric regression of brain artery tree structure as a response variable
to age based on weighted Fr\'echet means.

consequence of the singular vectors round-off errors introduced by the economy

factorization of the nonzero elements of the snapshots matrix is a valid
economy SVD for the full snapshots matrix. Numerical experiments are performed

quadratic reduced nonlinearities are computed via tensorial calculus. The
sparse matrix approximation strategy is compared against five existing methods

method, b) discrete empirical interpolation method, c) tensorial calculus, d)
full Jacobian projection onto the reduced basis subspace, and e) directional
derivatives of the model along the reduced basis functions. The sparse matrix

demonstrate that if network inter-connections are provided by hubs of the

this theoretical prediction in two independent experiments of functional brain

of people embedded in a social network working on the same task, find a good

conjecture that a good team member replacement should have good skill matching
as well as good structure matching. We formulate this problem using the concept
of graph kernel. To tackle the computational challenges, we propose a family of
fast algorithms by (a) designing effective pruning strategies, and (b)
exploring the smoothness between the existing and the new team structures. We
conduct extensive experimental evaluations on real world datasets to
demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency. Our algorithms (a) perform
significantly better than the alternative choices in terms of both precision
and recall; and (b) scale sub-linearly.

coefficient of the logarithm is fully determined by the mean-field interaction

exhibit a different universal behavior. We verify our results using numerical

studies on this topic employed social networks to boost search performance by
incorporating either local network features (e.g. the common connections

features (e.g. the PageRank), or both. However, the available social network
information can be restricted because of the privacy settings of involved
users, which in turn would affect the performance of people search. Therefore,
in this paper, we focus on the privacy issues in people search. We propose
simulating different privacy settings with a public social network due to the
unavailability of privacy-concerned networks. Our study examines the influences
of privacy concerns on the local and global network features, and their impacts
on the performance of people search. Our results show that: 1) the privacy
concerns of different people in the networks have different influences. People
with higher association (i.e. higher degree in a network) have much greater
impacts on the performance of people search; 2) local network features are more
sensitive to the privacy concerns, especially when such concerns come from high
association peoples in the network who are also related to the querying user.

differential equation. To investigate the possibilities of this method we
create a high quality universal equation of state, transforming the traditional
polytrope method to a tool with the potential for excellent predictive power.
The theoretical foundation of our equation of state is the same elastic
observable which we found equivalent to the polytrope index, the derivative of
the bulk modulus with respect to pressure. We calculate the density-pressure of
six common materials up to 10$^{18}$ Pa, mass-radius relationships for the same
materials, and produce plausible density-radius models for the rocky planets of
our solar system. We argue that the bulk modulus and its derivatives have been
under utilized in previous planet formation methods. We constrain the material
surface observables for the inner core, outer core, and mantle of planet Earth
in a systematic way including pressure, bulk modulus, and the polytrope index
in the analysis. We believe this variable polytrope method has the necessary
apparatus to be extended further to gas giants and stars. As supplemental

formation of this muonium state is temperature dependent and appears below
$\sim 70$ K. From the temperature dependence we estimate an activation energy
of $\sim 50$ meV in the bulk and $\sim 23$ meV near the free surface. The field
and directional dependence of the muonium precession frequencies further
supports the shallow impurity state with a rare example of a fully anisotropic
hyperfine tensor. From these measurements we determine the strength of the
hyperfine interaction and propose that the muon occupies an interstitial site
near the face of the oxygen octahedron in SrTiO$_3$. The observed shallow donor

implemented by monitoring colloidal particles immersed in a binary liquid
mixture near demixing and exposed to a chemically structured substrate. In
particular, critical Casimir forces have been measured for surfaces consisting
of stripes with periodically alternating adsorption preferences, forming
chemical steps between them. Motivated by these experiments, we analyze the
contribution of such chemical steps to the critical Casimir force for the film
geometry and within the Ising universality class. By means of Monte Carlo
simulations, mean-field theory, and finite-size scaling analysis we determine
the universal scaling function associated with the contribution to the critical
Casimir force due to individual, isolated chemical steps facing a surface with
homogeneous adsorption preference or with Dirichlet boundary condition. In line
with previous findings, these results allow one to compute the critical Casimir
force for the film geometry and in the presence of arbitrarily shaped, but wide
stripes. In this latter limit the force decomposes into a sum of the
contributions due to the two homogeneous parts of the surface and due to the
chemical steps between the stripes. We assess this decomposition by comparing
the resulting sum with actual simulation data for the critical Casimir force in
the presence of a chemically striped substrate.

parameters (e.g., astrophysical S-factors, resonance energies and strengths,
particle and gamma-ray partial widths). We discuss the application of the Monte
Carlo method to two distinct, but related, questions. First, given a set of
measured nuclear parameters, how can one best estimate the resulting
thermonuclear reaction rates and associated uncertainties? Second, given a set
of appropriate reaction rates, how can one best estimate the abundances from
nucleosynthesis (i.e., reaction network) calculations? The techniques described
here provide probability density functions that can be used to derive
statistically meaningful reaction rates and final abundances for any desired
coverage probability. Examples are given for applications to s-process neutron

Gaussian random variable with zero mean and unit variance. For $t~>~0$, Costa
proved that $e^{2h(X+\sqrt{t}Z)}$ is concave in $t$, where the proof hinged on
the first and second order derivatives of $h(X+\sqrt{t}Z)$. Specifically, these
two derivatives are signed, i.e., $\frac{\partial}{\partial t}h(X+\sqrt{t}Z)
\geq 0$ and $\frac{\partial^2}{\partial t^2}h(X+\sqrt{t}Z) \leq 0$. In this
paper, we show that the third order derivative of $h(X+\sqrt{t}Z)$ is
nonnegative, which implies that the Fisher information $J(X+\sqrt{t}Z)$ is
convex in $t$. We further show that the fourth order derivative of
$h(X+\sqrt{t}Z)$ is nonpositive. Following the first four derivatives, we make
two conjectures on $h(X+\sqrt{t}Z)$: the first is that
$\frac{\partial^n}{\partial t^n} h(X+\sqrt{t}Z)$ is nonnegative in $t$ if $n$
is odd, and nonpositive otherwise; the second is that $\log J(X+\sqrt{t}Z)$ is
convex in $t$. The first conjecture can be rephrased in the context of
completely monotone functions: $J(X+\sqrt{t}Z)$ is completely monotone in $t$.
The history of the first conjecture may date back to a problem in mathematical
physics studied by McKean in 1966. Apart from these results, we provide a
geometrical interpretation to the covariance-preserving transformation and
study the concavity of $h(\sqrt{t}X+\sqrt{1-t}Z)$, revealing its connection
with Costa's EPI.

flat internal profile of rotation imposed at the Zero-Age MS (ZAMS) is modified
by the action of meridional currents immediately after the ZAMS, causing the
surface rotational velocity to decrease abruptly until it reaches a
quasi-stationary state. We compute stellar models with non-solid rotation at
the ZAMS to obtain stellar evolutionary tracks with a larger content of angular
momentum, that attain rotational equatorial velocities close to the critical
limit throughout their MS phase. These models have a longer MS lifetime and a
higher surface chemical enrichment already at the end of the MS, particularly
at Z=0.002. Stellar models with solid rotation at the ZAMS adequately represent
the overall characteristics and evolution of differentially rotating models of
identical angular momentum content, but with a lower initial surface rotational
velocity. For these models we recommend to use as the initial rotational rate
the values derived once the quasi-stationary state is reached, after the abrupt
decrease in surface velocity. Interestingly, the initial equatorial rotational
velocities are virtually metallicity independent for the stellar models we
computed with the same mass and angular momentum content at the ZAMS. If, as
some observational evidence indicates, B-type stars at Z=0.002 rotate with a
higher equatorial velocity at the ZAMS than stars with Z=0.014, our finding
would indicate that the angular momentum content of B-type stars in the SMC is
higher than their Galactic counterparts.

anti-particles. Recently, the search for the MFs occurring as quasi-particle
excitations in solid-state systems has attracted widespread interest, because
of their fundamental importance in fundamental physics and potential
applications in topological quantum computation based on solid-state devices.
Here we study the quantum correlations between two spatially separate quantum
dots induced by a pair of MFs emerging at the two ends of a semiconductor
nanowire, in order to develop a new method for probing the MFs. We find that
without the tunnel coupling between these paired MFs, quantum entanglement
cannot be induced from an unentangled (i.e., product) state, but quantum
discord is observed due to the intrinsic nonlocal correlations of the paired
MFs. This finding reveals that quantum discord can indeed demonstrate the
intrinsic non-locality of the MFs formed in the nanowire. Also, quantum discord
can be employed to discriminate the MFs from the regular fermions. Furthermore,
we propose an experimental setup to measure the onset of quantum discord due to
the nonlocal correlations. Our approach provides a new, and experimentally
accessible, method to study the Majorana bound states by probing their
intrinsic non-locality signature.

known as (twistless) torsional Newton-Cartan geometry (TTNC). This is a version
of torsional Newton-Cartan geometry (TNC) in which the timelike vielbein
$\tau_\mu$ must be hypersurface orthogonal. For $z=2$ this version of TTNC
geometry is very closely related to the one appearing in holographic duals of
$z=2$ Lifshitz space-times based on Einstein gravity coupled to massive vector
fields in the bulk. For $z\neq 2$ there is however an extra degree of freedom
$b_0$ that does not appear in the holographic setup. We show that the result of
the gauging procedure can be extended to include a St\""uckelberg scalar $\chi$
that shifts under the particle number generator of the Schr\""odinger algebra,
as well as an extra special conformal symmetry that allows one to gauge away
$b_0$. The resulting version of TTNC geometry is the one that appears in the
holographic setup. This shows that Schr\""odinger symmetries play a crucial role
in holography for Lifshitz space-times and that in fact the entire boundary
geometry is dictated by local Schr\""odinger invariance. Finally we show how to
extend the formalism to generic torsional Newton-Cartan geometries by relaxing
the hypersurface orthogonality condition for the timelike vielbein $\tau_\mu$.

advantage of demotions on low-power states for energy saving. However, most of
the demotion schemes are statically performed on a limited number of
pre-selected low-power states, and are suboptimal for different workloads and
memory architectures. Even worse, the idle periods are often too short for
effective power state transitions, especially for memory intensive
applications. Wrong decisions on power state transition incur significant
energy and delay penalties. In this paper, we propose a novel memory system
design named RAMZzz with rank-aware energy saving optimizations including
dynamic page migrations and adaptive demotions. Specifically, we group the
pages with similar access locality into the same rank with dynamic page
migrations. Ranks have their hotness: hot ranks are kept busy for high
utilization and cold ranks can have more lengthy idle periods for power state
transitions. We further develop adaptive state demotions by considering all
low-power states for each rank and a prediction model to estimate the
power-down timeout among states. We experimentally compare our algorithm with
other energy saving policies with cycle-accurate simulation. Experiments with
benchmark workloads show that RAMZzz achieves significant improvement on
energy-delay2 and energy consumption over other energy saving techniques.

gamma-electron) colliders is discussed. The luminosity spectrum at photon
colliders is broad and has a rather sharp high-energy edge, which can be used,
for example, to measure the mass of the Higgs boson in the process gamma-gamma
to H or masses of charged scalars by observing the cross-section threshold. In
addition to the precise knowledge of the edge energy of the luminosity
spectrum, it is even more important to have a way to calibrate the absolute
energy scale of the detector. At first sight, Compton scattering itself
provides a unique way to determine the beam energies and produce particles of
known energies that could be used for detector calibration. The energy scale is
given by the electron mass m_e and laser photon energy \omega_0. However, this
does not work at realistic photon colliders due to large nonlinear effects in
Compton scattering at the conversion region (\xi^2 \sim 0.3). It is argued that
the process gamma-electron to eZ_0 provides the best way to calibrate the
energy scale of the detector, where the energy scale is given by m_Z.

different methods, the one is universal enveloping algebra of Lie superalgebra
and the other is N-fold supersymmetry. For the former we examine the q(2) and
osp(2/2) Lie-superalgebraic quasi-solvable matrix operators in the literature,
and then compare them with the corresponding N-fold supersymmetric matrix
systems. In the q(2) case, Lie-superalgebraic construction and the intertwining
relation lead to the identical result. In the osp(2/2) case, however, some
novel features emerge due to the difference in dimension of linear spaces which
consist of the two-component invariant subspace. In both cases, the closure of
N-fold superalgebra imposes stronger constraint on the admissible form of the
systems and the concept of conjugation plays a key role in the formulation.

the Canary island of La Palma, Spain. During summer 2011 and 2012 it underwent
a series of upgrades, involving the exchange of the MAGIC-I camera and its
trigger system, as well as the upgrade of the readout system of both
telescopes. We use observations of the Crab Nebula taken at low and medium
zenith angles to assess the key performance parameters of the MAGIC stereo
system. For low zenith angle observations, the standard trigger threshold of
the MAGIC telescopes is ~50GeV. The integral sensitivity for point-like sources
with Crab Nebula-like spectrum above 220GeV is (0.66+/-0.03)% of Crab Nebula
flux in 50 h of observations. The angular resolution, defined as the sigma of a
2-dimensional Gaussian distribution, at those energies is < 0.07 degree, while
the energy resolution is 16%. We also re-evaluate the effect of the systematic
uncertainty on the data taken with the MAGIC telescopes after the upgrade. We
estimate that the systematic uncertainties can be divided in the following
components: < 15% in energy scale, 11-18% in flux normalization and +/-0.15 for
the energy spectrum power-law slope.

to investigate both the properties of dark matter haloes and constrain the

scaling with redshift depend upon the cluster dark matter halo profiles and use
peak statistics to constrain the parameters of the mass - concentration (MC)
relation. We investigate which constraints the Euclid mission can set on the MC
coefficients also taking into account degeneracies with the cosmological
parameters. To this end, we first estimate the number of peaks and its redshift
distribution for different MC relations. We find that the steeper the mass
dependence and the larger the normalisation, the higher is the number of
detectable clusters, with the total number of peaks changing up to $40\%$
depending on the MC relation. We then perform a Fisher matrix forecast of the
errors on the MC relation parameters as well as cosmological parameters. We
find that peak number counts detected by Euclid can determine the normalization
$A_v$, the mass $B_v$ and redshift $C_v$ slopes and intrinsic scatter
$\sigma_v$ of the MC relation to an unprecedented accuracy being
$\sigma(A_v)/A_v = 1\%$, $\sigma(B_v)/B_v = 4\%$, $\sigma(C_v)/C_v = 9\%$,
$\sigma(\sigma_v)/\sigma_v = 1\%$ if all cosmological parameters are assumed to
be known. Should we relax this severe assumption, constraints are degraded, but
remarkably good results can be restored setting only some of the parameters or
combining peak counts with Planck data. This precision can give insight on
competing scenarios of structure formation and evolution and on the role of
baryons in cluster assembling. Alternatively, for a fixed MC relation, future
peaks counts can perform as well as current BAO and SNeIa when combined with
Planck.

observed abundances of metal-poor stars, we derived the Ge abundances of the

means that the contributed percentage of the Ge residual abundance in the Solar

local ULIRGs and high-z AGN dominated sources are clear outliers. We also
confirm that the strong anti-correlation between the L_CII/L_FIR ratio and the
far-IR color L_60/L_100 observed in the local Universe holds over a broad range

Well-known drawback of the greedy approach is that the chosen candidate is
often not the optimal solution due to the myopic decision in each iteration. In
this paper, we propose a greedy sparse recovery algorithm investigating
multiple promising candidates via the tree search. Two key ingredients of the
proposed algorithm, referred to as the matching pursuit with a tree pruning

put a restriction on columns of the sensing matrix to be investigated and the
{\it tree pruning} to eliminate unpromising paths from the search tree. In our
performance guarantee analysis and empirical simulations, we show that TMP is
effective in recovering sparse signals in both noiseless and noisy scenarios.

clear hourglass-shaped magnetic field aligned within 20 degree of the outflow
axis. Maps of high-density tracing spectral lines, e.g., H13CO+ (4-3), show
that the core is rotating about its minor axis, which is also aligned with the
magnetic field axis. Therefore, both the magnetic field and kinematic
properties observed in this region are surprisingly consistent with the
theoretical predictions of the classic paradigm of isolated low-mass star
formation. The strength of the magnetic field in the plane of sky is estimated
to be about 1.1 mG, resulting in a mass-to-magnetic flux ratio of 1.4 times the
critical value and a turbulent to ordered magnetic energy ratio of 0.4. We also
find that the specific angular momentum almost linearly decreases from r~0.6 pc

\times {\bf B} = \eta( {\bf J} - {\bf J}_{\rm EC} )$. This paper presents a new
closure relation for the EC driven current density appearing in this modified
Ohm's law. The new relation faithfully represents the nonlocal character of the
EC driven current and its main origin in the Fisch-Boozer effect. The closure
relation is validated on both an analytical solution of an approximated
Fokker-Planck equation as well as on full bounce-averaged, quasi-linear
Fokker-Planck code simulations of ECCD inside rotating magnetic islands. The
new model contains the model put forward by Giruzzi et al., Nucl. Fusion 39

Rydberg gases is studied numerically, in the framework of random matrix theory,
and via self-consistent diagrammatic techniques. Rydberg gases are made up of
randomly distributed, highly polarizable atoms that interact via strong dipolar
forces. Dynamics in such a system is fundamentally different from cases in
which the interactions are of short range, and is ultimately determined by the
spectral and eigenvector structure. In the energy levels' spacing statistics,
we find evidence for a critical energy that separates delocalized eigenstates
from states that are localized at pairs or clusters of atoms separated by less
than the typical nearest-neighbor distance. We argue that the dipole blockade
effect in Rydberg gases can be leveraged to manipulate this transition across a
wide range: As the blockade radius increases, the relative weight of localized
states is reduced. At the same time, the spectral statistics -- in particular,
the density of states and the nearest neighbor level spacing statistics --
exhibits a transition from approximately a 1-stable L\'evy to a Gaussian
orthogonal ensemble. Deviations from random matrix statistics are shown to stem
from correlations between interatomic interaction strengths that lead to an
asymmetry of the spectral density and profoundly affect localization
properties. We discuss approximations to the self-consistent Matsubara-Toyozawa
locator expansion that incorporate these effects.

by the study of the quantum complexity classes BQP and IQP. Recent results show
how to encode quantum computations as evaluations of classical partition
functions. These results rely on interesting and deep results about quantum
computation in order to obtain hardness results about the difficulty of
(classically) evaluating the partition functions for certain fixed parameters.
  The motivation for this paper is to study more comprehensively the complexity
of (classically) approximating the Ising and Tutte partition functions with
complex parameters. Partition functions are combinatorial in nature and
quantifying their approximation complexity does not require a detailed
understanding of quantum computation. Using combinatorial arguments, we give
the first full classification of the complexity of multiplicatively
approximating the norm and additively approximating the argument of the Ising
partition function for complex edge interactions (as well as of approximating
the partition function according to a natural complex metric). We also study
the norm approximation problem in the presence of external fields, for which we
give a complete dichotomy when the parameters are roots of unity. Previous
results were known just for a few such points, and we strengthen these results
from BQP-hardness to #P-hardness. Moreover, we show that computing the sign of
the Tutte polynomial is #P-hard at certain points related to the simulation of
BQP. Using our classifications, we then revisit the connections to quantum
computation, drawing conclusions that are a little different from (and
incomparable to) ones in the quantum literature, but along similar lines.

is shown that the Chaplygin equations support a nonlinear superposition
principle. A known spacetime mixing symmetry is shown to decompose into
label-time and superposition symmetries. It is shown that a quantum mechanical
system in a stationary state behaves as a Chaplygin gas. The extension to d > 1

Cameron--Liebler line classes of ${\rm PG}(3,q)$ having parameter
$\frac{q^{2}-1}{2}$. This is the second known infinite family of nontrivial

  The study of Cameron--Liebler line classes is closely related to the study of
symmetric tactical decompositions of ${\rm PG}(3,q)$ (those having the same
number of point classes as line classes). We show that our new examples occur
as line classes in such a tactical decomposition when $q \equiv 9 \bmod 12$ (so
$q = 3^{2e}$ for some positive integer $e$), providing an infinite family of
counterexamples to a conjecture made by Cameron and Liebler in 1982; the nature
of these decompositions allows us to also prove the existence of a set of type
$\left(\frac{1}{2}(3^{2e}-3^{e}), \frac{1}{2}(3^{2e}+3^{e}) \right)$ in the
affine plane ${\rm AG}(2,3^{2e})$ for all positive integers $e$. This proves a

elementary and broadly relevant to network analysis in practice -- that the
uncertainty in approximating some true network graph $G=(V,E)$ by some
estimated graph $\hat{G}=(V,\hat{E})$ manifests as errors in the status of
(non)edges that must necessarily propagate to any estimates of network
summaries $\eta(G)$ we seek. Motivated by the common practice of using plug-in
estimates $\eta(\hat{G})$ as proxies for $\eta(G)$, our focus is on the problem
of characterizing the distribution of the discrepancy $D=\eta(\hat{G}) -
\eta(G)$, in the case where $\eta(\cdot)$ is a subgraph count. Specifically, we
study the fundamental case where the statistic of interest is $|E|$, the number
of edges in $G$. Our primary contribution in this paper is to show that in the
empirically relevant setting of large graphs with low-rate measurement errors,
the distribution of $D_E=|\hat{E}| - |E|$ is well-characterized by a Skellam
distribution, when the errors are independent or weakly dependent. Under an
assumption of independent errors, we are able to further show conditions under
which this characterization is strictly better than that of an appropriate
normal distribution. These results derive from our formulation of a general
result, quantifying the accuracy with which the difference of two sums of
dependent Bernoulli random variables may be approximated by the difference of
two independent Poisson random variables, i.e., by a Skellam distribution. This
general result is developed through the use of Stein's method, and may be of
some general interest. We finish with a discussion of possible extension of our
work to subgraph counts $\eta(G)$ of higher order.

systematic study that enables the mapping of the different behaviors observed
to the parameter space ($\mathrm{Re}_{_{F}},\mathrm{Ro}_{_{F}}$), and the
examination of different limiting procedures for approaching the large
$\mathrm{Re}_{_{F}}$ small $\mathrm{Ro}_{_F}$ limit. Four distinctly different
states were identified: {\it laminar, intermittent bursts, quasi-2D
condensates, and weakly rotating turbulence}. These four different states are
separated by power-law boundaries $\mathrm{Ro}_{_F} \propto
\mathrm{Re}_{_{F}}^{-\gamma}$ in the small $\mathrm{Ro}_{_F}$ limit. In this

results of the direct numerical simulations. While the first order expansion is
in good agreement with the results of the linear stability theory, it fails to
reproduce the dynamical behavior of the quasi-2D part of the flow in the
nonlinear regime, indicating that higher order terms in the expansion need to
be taken in to account. The large number of simulations allows also to
investigate the scaling that relates the amplitude of the fluctuations with the
energy dissipation rate and the control parameters of the system for the
different states of the flow. Different scaling was observed for different

second-order perturbation corrections in a correlated basis. Going to higher

the normal state of the system which is characterized by a divergence of the

phonon-exchange driven dimerization of the system, similar to what one has at
zero density when the vacuum scattering length $\a0$ diverges. We then study,
in the stable regime, the superfluid gap and its dependence on the density and
the interaction strength. We identify two different corrections to low-density

inspection of the temperature dependence, which had not been done in such
detail before. We measured the transmission of three ice layers with different
thicknesses at temperatures $\vartheta = 10...250$K and present data at
wavelengths $\lambda=80...625$ microns. We found a change in the spectral
dependence of $\kappa$ at a wavelength of $175 \pm 6$ microns. At shorter
wavelengths, $\kappa$ exhibits a constant flat slope and no significant
temperature dependence. Long-ward of that wavelength, the slope gets steeper
and has a clear, approximately linear temperature dependence. This change in
the behaviour is probably caused by a characteristic absorption band of water
ice. The measured data were fitted by a power-law model that analytically
describes the absorption behaviour at an arbitrary temperature. This model can
readily be applied to any object of interest, for instance a protoplanetary or
a debris disk. To illustrate how the model works, we simulated the spectral
energy distribution (SED) of the resolved, large debris disk around the nearby
solar-type star HD 207129. Replacing our ice model by another, commonly used
data set for water ice results in a different SED slope at longer wavelengths.
This leads to changes in the characteristic model parameters of the disk, such
as the inferred particle size distribution, and affects the interpretation of
the underlying collisional physics of the disk.

the charge diffusion constant, $D \gtrsim \hbar v_{F}^{2}/(k_{B}T)$, in the
incoherent regime of transport, where $v_F$ is the Fermi velocity and $T$ the

diffusion constant in a single band Hubbard model at half filling. We show that
in the strongly correlated regime the Hartnoll's bound is violated in the
crossover region between the coherent Fermi liquid region and the incoherent

velocity $v_F$ is replaced by its low temperature renormalised value,
$v_F^*$.The bound is satisfied at all temperatures in the weakly and moderately
correlated systems as well as in strongly correlated systems in the high

study their atmospheres. Unfortunately, the required precision to extract
atmospheric information surpasses the design specifications of most general
purpose instrumentation, resulting in instrumental systematics in the light
curves that are typically larger than the target precision. Systematics must
therefore be modelled, leaving the inference of light curve parameters
conditioned on the subjective choice of models and model selection criteria.
This paper aims to test the reliability of the most commonly used systematics
models and model selection criteria. As we are primarily interested in
recovering light curve parameters rather than the favoured systematics model,
marginalisation over systematics models is introduced as a more robust
alternative than simple model selection. This can incorporate uncertainties in
the choice of systematics model into the error budget as well as the model
parameters. Its use is demonstrated using a series of simulated transit light
curves. Stochastic models, specifically Gaussian processes, are also discussed
in the context of marginalisation over systematics models, and are found to
reliably recover the transit parameters for a wide range of systematics
functions. None of the tested model selection criteria - including the BIC -
routinely recovered the correct model. This means that commonly used methods
that are based on simple model selection may underestimate the uncertainties
when extracting transmission and eclipse spectra from real data, and
low-significance claims using such techniques should be treated with caution.
In general, no systematics modelling techniques are perfect; however,
marginalisation over many systematics models helps to mitigate poor model
selection, and stochastic processes provide an even more flexible approach to
modelling instrumental systematics.

proposed theory of Maximally Natural Supersymmetry (MNSUSY). MNSUSY is an
unusual supersymmetric (SUSY) extension of the Standard Model (SM) which,
remarkably, is un-tuned at present LHC limits. It employs Scherk-Schwarz
breaking of SUSY by boundary conditions upon compactifying an underlying
5-dimensional (5D) theory down to 4D, and is not well-described by
softly-broken $\mathcal{N}=1$ SUSY, with much different phenomenology than the
Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) and its variants. The usual
CP-conserving SUSY-flavor problem is automatically solved in MNSUSY due to a
residual almost exact $U(1)_R$ symmetry, naturally heavy and highly degenerate
1st- and 2nd-generation sfermions, and heavy gauginos and Higgsinos. Depending
on the exact implementation of MNSUSY there exist important new sources of
flavor violation involving gauge boson Kaluza-Klein (KK) excitations. The
spatial localization properties of the matter multiplets, in particular the
brane localization of the 3rd generation states, imply KK-parity is broken and
{\it tree-level} contributions to flavor changing neutral currents are present
in general. Nevertheless, we show that simple variants of the basic MNSUSY
model are safe from present flavor constraints arising from kaon and $B$-meson
oscillations, the rare decays $B_{s,d} \to \mu^+ \mu^-$, $\mu \to {\bar e}ee$

features of the radiative decays $\mu \to e \gamma$ and ${\bar B}\to X_s

the statistical significance of the time series against random phase
permutations, our data show a pronounced peak of significance for time window
widths around 20-30 TR (40-60 sec). Using the appropriate window width, we show
that FC patterns oscillate between phases of high modularity, primarily shaped
by anatomy, and phases of low modularity, primarily shaped by inter-network
connectivity. Building upon recent results in dynamic FC, this emphasizes the
potential role of SC as a transitory architecture between different highly
connected resting state FC patterns. Finally, we show that networks implied in
consciousness-related processes, such as the default mode network (DMN),
contribute more to these brain-level fluctuations compared to other networks,
such as the motor or somatosensory networks. This suggests that the

star is the small frequency separation which is sensitive to the gradient of
the mean molecular weight in the stellar interior. It is thus interesting to
discuss the classical age-activity relations in terms of this quantity.
Moreover, as the photospheric magnetic field tends to suppress the amplitudes
of acoustic oscillations, it is important to quantify the importance of this
effect by considering various activity indicators. We propose a new class of
age-activity relations that connects the Mt. Wilson $S$ index and the average
scatter in the light curve with the small frequency separation and the
amplitude of the p-mode oscillations. We used a Bayesian inference to compute
the posterior probability of various empirical laws for a sample of 19
solar-like active stars observed by the Kepler telescope. We demonstrate the
presence of a clear correlation between the Mt. Wilson $S$ index and the
relative age of the stars as indicated by the small frequency separation, as
well as an anti-correlation between the $S$ index and the oscillation
amplitudes. We argue that the average activity level of the stars shows a
stronger correlation with the small frequency separation than with the absolute
age that is often considered in the literature. The phenomenological laws
discovered in this paper have the potential to become new important diagnostics
to link stellar evolution theory with the dynamics of global magnetic fields.
In particular we argue that the relation between the Mt. Wilson $S$ index and
the oscillation amplitudes is in good agreement with the findings of direct

equations of motion for electrically charged particles in an electric and
magnetic field. Boris-SDC relies on a combination of the Boris-integrator with
spectral deferred corrections (SDC). SDC can be considered as preconditioned
Picard iteration to compute the stages of a collocation method. In this
interpretation, inverting the preconditioner corresponds to a sweep with a
low-order method. In Boris-SDC, the Boris method, a second-order Lorentz force
integrator based on velocity-Verlet, is used as a sweeper/preconditioner. The
presented method provides a generic way to extend the classical Boris
integrator, which is widely used in essentially all particle-based plasma
physics simulations involving magnetic fields, to a high-order method.
Stability, convergence order and conservation properties of the method are
demonstrated for different simulation setups. Boris-SDC reproduces the expected
high order of convergence for a single particle and for the center-of-mass of a
particle cloud in a Penning trap and shows good long-term energy stability.

inherent in mathematics and the implications for physics of this ambiguity. To
display the mathematical form of equations of quantum theory used to describe
experiments, we make explicit the knobs by which the devices of an experiment
are arranged and adjusted. A quantum description comes in two parts: (1) a
statement of results of an experiment, expressed by probabilities of detections
as functions of knob settings, and (2) an explanation of how we think these
results come about, expressed by linear operators, also as functions of knob
settings. Because quantum mechanics separates the two parts of any description,
it is known that between the statements of results and the explanations lurks a
logical gap: given any statement of results one has a choice of explanations.
  Here we work out some consequences of this openness to choice. We show how
quantum theory as mathematical language in which to describe experiments
necessarily involves multiple descriptions: multiple explanations of a given
result, as well as multiple statements of results and multiple arrangement of
knobs. Appreciating these multiplicities resolves what otherwise is a confusion
in the concept of invariance. Implications of multiplicity of description for
the security of quantum key distribution are noted.

(IRIS) in its NUV channel show that at the peak of the continuum enhancement,
the contrast at the quasi-continuum window above 2813 \AA\ reached 100 - 200 %
and can be even larger closer to the Mg II lines. This is fully consistent with
the hydrogen recombination Balmer continuum emission, which follows an
impulsive thermal and non-thermal ionization caused by the precipitation of
electron beams through the chromosphere. However, a less probable photospheric
continuum enhancement cannot be excluded. The light curves of the Balmer
continuum have an impulsive character with a gradual fading, similar to those
detected recently in the optical region on Hinode/SOT. This observation
represents a first Balmer-continuum detection from space far beyond the Balmer
limit (3646 \AA), eliminating seeing effects known to complicate the WLF
detection. Moreover, we use a spectral window so far unexplored for flare
studies, which provides the potential to study the Balmer continuum, as well as
many metallic lines appearing in emission during flares. Combined with future
ground-based observations of the continuum near the Balmer limit, we will be
able to disentangle between various scenarios of the WLF origin. IRIS
observations also provide a critical quantitative measure of the energy
radiated in the Balmer continuum, which constrains various models of the energy
transport and deposition during flares.

consider the model-checking problem of the logics QATL and QATLs on one-counter
game models with VASS semantics for which we develop algorithms and provide
matching lower bounds. Our algorithms are based on reductions of the
model-checking problems to model-checking games. This approach makes it quite
simple for us to deal with extensions of the logical languages as well as the
infinite state spaces. The framework generalizes on one hand qualitative
problems such as ATL/ATLs model-checking of finite-state systems,
model-checking of the branching-time temporal logics CTL and CTLs on
one-counter processes and the realizability problem of LTL specifications. On
the other hand the model-checking problem for QATL/QATLs generalizes
quantitative problems such as the fixed-initial credit problem for energy games

results are positive as we show that the generalizations are not too costly

existing prototype based clustering algorithms will no longer be effective.
While the data for the current clustering task may be scarce, there is usually
some useful knowledge available in the related scenes/domains. In this study,
the concept of transfer learning is applied to prototype based fuzzy clustering
(PFC). Specifically, the idea of leveraging knowledge from the source domain is
exploited to develop a set of transfer prototype based fuzzy clustering (TPFC)
algorithms. Three prototype based fuzzy clustering algorithms, namely, FCM,
fuzzy k-plane clustering (FKPC) and fuzzy subspace clustering (FSC), have been
chosen to incorporate with knowledge leveraging mechanism to develop the
corresponding transfer clustering algorithms. Novel objective functions are
proposed to integrate the knowledge of source domain with the data of target
domain for clustering in the target domain. The proposed algorithms have been
validated on different synthetic and real-world datasets and the results
demonstrate their effectiveness when compared with both the original prototype
based fuzzy clustering algorithms and the related clustering algorithms like
multi-task clustering and co-clustering.

the result of ongoing active accretion and one of the main sources of
mechanical feedback on small scales. Water is the ideal tracer of these effects
because it is present in high abundance in various parts of the protostar.
Method: We present \textit{Herschel} HIFI spectra of multiple water-transitions
towards 29 nearby Class 0/I protostars as part of the WISH Survey. These are
decomposed into different Gaussian components, with each related to one of
three parts of the protostellar system; quiescent envelope, cavity shock and
spot shocks in the jet and at the base of the outflow. We then constrain the
excitation conditions present in the two outflow-related components. Results:
Water emission is optically thick but effectively thin, with line ratios that
do not vary with velocity, in contrast to CO. The physical conditions of the
cavity and spot shocks are similar, with post-shock H$_{2}$ densities of order
10$^{5}-$10$^{8}$\,cm$^{-3}$ and H$_{2}$O column densities of order
10$^{16}-$10$^{18}$\,cm$^{-2}$. H$_{2}$O emission originates in compact
emitting regions: for the spot shocks these correspond to point sources with
radii of order 10-200\,AU, while for the cavity shocks these come from a thin
layer along the outflow cavity wall with thickness of order 1-30\,AU.
Conclusions: Water emission at the source position traces two distinct
kinematic components in the outflow; J shocks at the base of the outflow or in
the jet, and C shocks in a thin layer in the cavity wall. Class I sources have
similar excitation conditions to Class 0 sources, but generally smaller
line-widths and emitting region sizes. We suggest that it is the velocity of
the wind driving the outflow, rather than the decrease in envelope density or
mass, that is the cause of the decrease in H$_{2}$O intensity between Class 0
and I.

improves communication efficiency --- communication costs are linear in the

computational correctness. We present a theoretical convergence analysis of
SFB, and empirically corroborate its efficiency on four different

paper, the PDF of condensed structures has been analyzed and an analytical
formula presented based on a truncated radial density profile, $\rho(r) =

temperature-driven air redistribution to quantify the ratio between changes of
sea level pressure $p_s$ and mean tropospheric temperature $T_a$ in the
tropics. This model assumes that the height of the tropical troposphere is
isobaric. Here problems with this model are identified. A revised relationship
between $p_s$ and $T_a$ is derived governed by two parameters -- the isobaric
and isothermal heights -- rather than just one. Further insight is provided by
the model of R S Lindzen and S Nigam [J. Atmos. Sci. 44 (1987) 2418], which was
the first to use the concept of isobaric height to relate tropical $p_s$ to air
temperature, and did this by assuming that isobaric height is always around 3
km and isothermal height is likewise near constant. Observational data,
presented here, show that neither of these heights is spatially universal nor
do their mean values match previous assumptions. Analyses show that the ratio
of the long-term changes in $p_s$ and $T_a$ associated with land-sea
temperature contrasts in a warming climate -- the focus of Bayr and Dommenget
[2013] -- is in fact determined by the corresponding ratio of spatial
differences in the annual mean $p_s$ and $T_a$. The latter ratio, reflecting
lower pressure at higher temperature in the tropics, is dominated by meridional
pressure and temperature differences rather than by land-sea contrasts.
Considerations of isobaric heights are shown to be unable to predict either
spatial or temporal variation in $p_s$. As noted by Bayr and Dommenget [2013],
the role of moisture dynamics in generating sea level pressure variation
remains in need of further theoretical investigations.

can be estimated for all incoming neutron energies up to ~16 MeV.

neutron-induced fission from an evaluation performed by Lestone
(LA-UR-05-0288). This evaluation assumes the multiplicity distributions are
Gaussian and adjusts the standard deviations to reproduce measured 2nd and 3rd
factorial moments. In MCNPX, users have the option of using multiplicity
distributions for spontaneous fission using an evaluation of the available
experimental data by Santi and Miller (LA-UR-07-6229). The spontaneous fission
multiplicity distributions and corresponding factorial moments from these two
evaluations are compared in the present paper. The differences are minor or
within experimental errors for all but the spontaneous fission of 238Pu. The
238Pu evaluations are based on data obtained in 1956. We recommend that the
238Pu multiplicity distribution be re-measured. Given the good agreement
between the two evaluations, the choice of evaluation will make little
difference for the modeling of spontaneous fission. However, we suggest that
the evaluation in LA-UR-05-0288 be adopted as the MCNP default because it also
includes recommended distributions for neutron induced fission.

promoted the creation of cryptosystems to enable receivers to interpret the
exchanged information. In this paper, a particular public key cryptosystem
called the ElGamal Cryptosystem is presented considered with the help MATLAB
Program to be used over Images. Since the ElGamal cryptosystem over a primitive
root of a large prime is used in messages encryption in the free GNU Privacy
Guard software, recent versions of PGP, and other cryptosystems. This paper
shows a modification of the this cryptosystem by applying it over gray and
color images. That would be by transforming an image into its corresponding
matrix using MATLAB Program, then applying the encryption and decryption
algorithms over it. Actually, this modification gives one of the best image
encryptions that have been used since the encryption procedure over any image
goes smoothly and transfers the original image to completely undefined image
which makes this cryptosystem is really secure and successful over image
encryption. As well as, the decryption procedure of the encrypted image works
very well since it transfers undefined image to its original. Therefore, this
new modification can make the cryptosystem of images more immune against some
future attacks since breaking this cryptosystem depends on solving the discrete
logarithm problem which is really impossible with large prime numbers .

this purpose we use the approach of Newtonian gravitational instability, and
thereafter we add corrections to arrive to a full relativistic description. In
Cosmology and Astrophysics, it is usual to decompose the dark sector into two
species, dark matter and dark energy. We will use instead a unified approach by
describing a single unified dark fluid with very simple assumptions, namely the
dark fluid is barotropic and its sound speed vanishes.
