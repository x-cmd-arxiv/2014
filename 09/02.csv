couples the two lower-energy states of a {\Lambda} energy-level system thereby
transforming into a {\Delta} system. Our theoretical description includes
effects of ground-state coherence decay and temperature effects. In particular,
we demonstrate that driving-field-enhanced electromagnetically induced
transparency is robust against significant loss of coherence between ground

separates the probe-transmittance behavior into two regimes: probe
amplification vs probe attenuation. Thus, electromagnetically induced

graphs. A graph is fan-planar if it can be embedded in the plane, such that
each edge that is crossed more than once, is crossed by a bundle of two or more
edges incident to a common vertex. A graph is outer-fan-planar if it has a
fan-planar embedding in which every vertex is on the outer face. If, in
addition, the insertion of an edge destroys its outer-fan-planarity, then it is
maximal outer-fan-planar. In this paper, we present a polynomial-time algorithm
to test whether a given graph is maximal outer-fan-planar. The algorithm can
also be employed to produce an outer-fan-planar embedding, if one exists. On
the negative side, we show that testing fan-planarity of a graph is NP-hard,

the masses of the CMCs, the thick discs, and the thin discs ($\mathcal{M}_{\rm

results are compatible with having CMCs and thick discs built in a short and
early high star forming intensity phase. These components were born thick
because of the large scale height of the turbulent gas disc in which they
originated. Our results indicate that the ratio between the star forming rate

Unpredictability and small flux variations make this phenomenon elusive and
difficult to detect. Variance based probes such as the C and F tests, or a
combination of both, are popular methods to compare the light-curves of the
quasar and a comparison star. Recently, detection claims in some studies depend
on the agreement of the results of the C and F tests, or of two instances of
the F-test, in rejecting the non-variation null hypothesis. However, the C-test
is a non-reliable statistical procedure, the F-test is not robust, and the
combination of tests with concurrent results is anything but a straightforward
methodology. A priori Power Analysis calculations and post hoc analysis of
Monte-Carlo simulations show excellent agreement for the Analysis of Variance
test to detect microvariations, as well as the limitations of the F-test.
Additionally, combined tests yield correlated probabilities that make the
assessment of statistical significance unworkable. However, it is possible to
include data from several field stars to enhance the power in a single F-test,
increasing the reliability of the statistical analysis. This would be the
preferred methodology when several comparison stars are available. An example
using two stars and the enhanced F-test is presented. These results show the
importance of using adequate methodologies, and avoid inappropriate procedures
that can jeopardize microvariability detections. Power analysis and Monte-Carlo
simulations are useful tools for research planning, as they can reveal the
robustness and reliability of different research approaches.

in the total amount of dark matter may be constrained by considering their
capture by neutron stars (NSs), which leads to the rapid destruction of the
latter. The constraints depend crucially on the capture rate which, in turn, is
determined by the energy loss by a PBH passing through a NS. Two alternative
approaches to estimate the energy loss have been used in the literature: the
one based on the dynamical friction mechanism, and another on tidal
deformations of the NS by the PBH. The second mechanism was claimed to be more
efficient by several orders of magnitude due to the excitation of particular
oscillation modes reminiscent of the surface waves. We address this
disagreement by considering a simple analytically solvable model that consists
of a flat incompressible fluid in an external gravitational field. In this
model, we calculate the energy loss by a PBH traversing the fluid surface. We
find that the excitation of modes with the propagation velocity smaller than
that of PBH is suppressed, which implies that in a realistic situation of a
supersonic PBH the large contributions from the surface waves are absent and
the above two approaches lead to consistent expressions for the energy loss.

All the three confined flares take place successively at the same location and
have similar morphologies, so can be termed homologous confined flares. In the
simultaneous images obtained by the Solar Dynamics Observatory, many
large-scale coronal loops above the confined flares are clearly observed in
multi-wavelengths. At the pre-flare stage, two dipoles emerge near the negative
sunspot, and the dipolar patches are connected by small loops appearing as
arch-shaped H$\alpha$ fibrils. There exists a reconnection between the small
loops, and thus the H$\alpha$ fibrils change their configuration. The
reconnection also occurs between a set of emerging H$\alpha$ fibrils and a set
of pre-existing large loops, which are rooted in the negative sunspot, a nearby
positive patch, and some remote positive faculae, forming a typical
three-legged structure. During the flare processes, the overlying loops, some
of which are tracked by activated dark materials, do not break out. These
direct observations may illustrate the physical mechanism of confined flares,
i.e., magnetic reconnection between the emerging loops and the pre-existing
loops triggers flares and the overlying loops prevent the flares from being
eruptive.

translation. Unlike the traditional statistical machine translation, the neural

recently for neural machine translation often belong to a family of
encoder-decoders and consists of an encoder that encodes a source sentence into
a fixed-length vector from which a decoder generates a translation. In this
paper, we conjecture that the use of a fixed-length vector is a bottleneck in
improving the performance of this basic encoder-decoder architecture, and
propose to extend this by allowing a model to automatically (soft-)search for
parts of a source sentence that are relevant to predicting a target word,
without having to form these parts as a hard segment explicitly. With this new
approach, we achieve a translation performance comparable to the existing
state-of-the-art phrase-based system on the task of English-to-French

The method is an adaption of the method used in [Pickl, Lett. Math. Phys.,
97(2):151-164, 2011] for bosonic systems to fermionic systems. It is based on a
Gronwall type estimate for a suitable measure of distance between the
microscopic solution and an antisymmetrized product state. We use this method
to treat a new mean-field limit for fermions with long-range interactions in a
large volume. Some of our results hold for singular attractive or repulsive
interactions. We can also treat Coulomb interaction assuming either a mild
singularity cutoff or certain regularity conditions on the solutions to the
Hartree(-Fock) equations. In the considered limit, the kinetic and interaction
energy are of the same order, while the average force is subleading. For some
interactions, we prove that the Hartree(-Fock) dynamics is a more accurate
approximation than a simpler dynamics that one would expect from the subleading
force. With our method we also treat the mean-field limit coupled to a
semiclassical limit, which was discussed in the literature before, and we
recover some of the previous results. All results hold for initial data close

decompositions of $m \in [F_n, F_{n+1})$, appropriately normalized, converges
to the standard normal. The proofs crucially used the fact that all integers in

  We generalize these results to subintervals of $[F_n, F_{n+1})$ as $n \to

have different sets of potential summands. Explicitly, fix an integer sequence
$\alpha(n) \to \infty$. As $n \to \infty$, for almost all $m \in [F_n,

decompositions of integers in the subintervals $[m, m + F_{\alpha(n)})$,
appropriately normalized, converges to the standard normal. The proof follows
by showing that, with probability tending to $1$, $m$ has at least one
appropriately located large gap between indices in its decomposition. We then
use a correspondence between this interval and $[0, F_{\alpha(n)})$ to obtain
the result, since the summands are known to have Gaussian behavior in the

what extent phonons are involved in the associated instabilities. Here we
address this problem based on the Hubbard model including a coupling to phonons

We find that possible charge order is mainly driven by Fermi surface nesting,
with competition between a near-(pi,pi) order at low doping and antinodal
nesting at higher doping, very similar to the momentum structure of magnetic
fluctuations. The resulting nesting vectors are generally consistent with
photoemission and tunneling observations, evidence for charge density wave

of competition between one- and two-q-vector nesting.

the time-varying side information; and perfect state information at the

implications of the galactic aberration in proper motions (GA). This effect
causes systematic errors in astrometric measurements at a microarcsecond level.
Some authors consider it so serious that it requires redefinition of the
celestial reference system (CRF). We argue that such attention to the GA is too
much exaggerated. It is just a small astrometric correction that must be taken
into account during highly accurate astrometric and geodetic data processing.
The accuracy of this correction depends on accuracy of the Galactic rotation
parameters and, for most application, on the accuracy of the rotation matrix
between Galactic and equatorial systems. Our analysis has shown that our today
knowledge of these two factors is sufficient to compute the GA correction with
accuracy of better than 10%. The remaining effect at a level of few tenths
microarcsecond/yr is negligible nowadays. Another consequence of introducing
the GA correction is necessity to return to classical astrometric modeling of
the VLBI-derived extragalactic radio source position by the linear trend model.
Changing the current paradigm of VLBI-derived CRF based on assumption of zero
motion of radio sources to classical one leads to bias in the radio source
positions up to several tens microarcseconds for catalog at epoch J2000.0.

to study the genericity and stability of the formation of black holes and
locally naked singularities in collapse. While the occurrence of naked
singularities is known for many models of collapse, the key issue now in focus
is genericity and stability of these outcomes. Towards this purpose, we study
how the introduction of a somewhat general class of small inhomogeneities in
homogeneous collapse leading to a black hole can change the final outcome to a
naked singularity. The key feature that we assume for the perturbation profile
is that of a mass profile that is separable in radial and temporal coordinates.
The known models of dust and homogeneous perfect fluid collapse can be obtained

Reionization is the key science driver for several ongoing ground-based and
future ground/space-based experiments. The crucial spectral features in the
global 21 cm signal (turning points) occur at low radio frequencies <100 MHz.
In addition to the human-generated RFI, Earth's ionosphere drastically corrupts
low-frequency radio observations from the ground. In this paper, we examine the
effects of time-varying ionospheric refraction, absorption and thermal emission
at these low radio frequencies and their combined effect on any ground-based
global 21 cm experiment. It should be noted that this is the first study of the
effect of a dynamic ionosphere on global 21 cm experiments. The fluctuations in
the ionosphere are influenced by solar activity with flicker noise
characteristics. The same characteristics are reflected in the ionospheric
corruption to any radio signal passing through the ionosphere. As a result, any
ground based observations of the faint global 21 cm signal are corrupted by
flicker noise (or ""$1/f$"" noise, where ""$f$"" is the dynamical frequency) which
scales as $\nu^{-2}$ (where $\nu$ is the frequency of observation) in the
presence of a bright galactic foreground ($\propto \nu^{-s}$, where $s$ is
radio spectral index). Hence, the calibration of the ionosphere for any such
experiment is critical. Any attempt to calibrate the ionospheric effects will
be subject to the inaccuracies in the current ionospheric measurements using
GPS ionospheric measurements, riometer measurements, ionospheric soundings,
etc. Even considering an optimistic improvement in the accuracy of GPS-TEC
(Total Electron Content) measurements, we conclude that the detection of the
global 21 cm signal below 100 MHz is best done from above the Earth's
atmosphere in orbit of the Moon.

show how the results of \cite{biadan} on the existence of a \emph{Sudakov

  More precisely, we prove that there exists a partition of $\mathbb R^d$ into
a family of disjoint sets $\{S^h_\mathfrak a\}_{h,\mathfrak a}$ together with
the projection $\{O^h_\mathfrak a\}_{h,\mathfrak a}$ on $\mathbb R^d$ of proper
extremal faces of $\mathrm{epi}\, \mathtt c$, $h = 0,\dots,d$ and $\mathfrak a

  - $S^h_\mathfrak a$ is relatively open in its affine span, and has affine

of signal-to-noise ratios for gravitational wave detection. Because
gravitational waves (GWs) are almost impossible to obscure via dust absorption
or other astrophysical processes, the strength of the detected signal is
dictated solely by the emission strength and the distance to the source.
Assuming that the space density of an arbitrary population of GW sources does
not evolve, we show explicitly that the distribution of detected
signal-to-noise (SNR) values depends solely on the detection threshold; it is
independent of the detector network (interferometer or pulsar timing array),
the individual detector noise curves (initial or Advanced LIGO), the nature of
the GW sources (compact binary coalescence, supernova, or some other discrete
source), and the distributions of source variables (only non-spinning neutron
stars of mass exactly $1.4\,M_\odot$ or a complicated distribution of masses
and spins). We derive the SNR distribution for each individual detector within
a network as a function of the relative detector orientations and
sensitivities. While most detections will have SNR near the detection
threshold, there will be a tail of events to higher SNR. We derive the SNR
distribution of the loudest (highest SNR) events in any given sample of
detections. We find that the median SNR of the loudest out of the first four
events should have an $\mbox{SNR}=22$ (for a threshold of 12, appropriate for
the Advanced LIGO/Virgo network), increasing to a median value for the loudest
SNR of 47 for 40 detections. We expect these loudest events to provide
particularly powerful constraints on their source parameters, and they will
play an important role in extracting astrophysics from gravitational wave
sources. These distributions also offer an important internal calibration of

  We conjecture that the heart of $t_{hom}(S)$ is given by cycle modules over
$S$ (as defined by Rost); for varieties over characteristic $0$ fields this
conjecture was recently proved by Deglise. Our definition of $t_{hom}(S)$ is
closely related to a new effectivity filtration for $DM(S)$ (and for the
subcategory of Chow $S$-motives in it). We also sketch the construction of a
certain Gersten weight structure for the category of $S$-comotives; this weight
structure yields one more description of $t_{hom}(S)$ and its heart.

self-interstital atoms (SIA) in 10-lattice-parameter $\alpha$-Fe boxes, two

to limit the rate of relaxation of these simple point-defect systems.

stars or nonradial pulsations of ultracompact objects. Here we present a
detailed study of the evolution of the Einstein-Klein-Gordon system in a

numerical evidence that gravitational collapse always occurs, at least for

collapse time scales as the inverse square of the initial amplitude in the
small-amplitude limit. In addition, we find that fields with nonresonant
spectrum collapse earlier than in the fully-resonant case, a result that is at
odds with the current understanding of the process. Energy is transferred
through a direct cascade to high frequencies when the spectrum is resonant, but
we observe both direct- and inverse-cascade effects for nonresonant spectra.
Our results indicate that a fully-resonant spectrum might not be a crucial

parameters with mean squared error that scales as $1/N^2$ with the number of
particles involved---substantially surpassing the $1/N$-scaling characteristic
to classical statistics. A natural question arises, whether such an impressive
enhancement persists when one takes into account the decoherence effects that
are unavoidable in any real-life implementation. In this thesis, we resolve a
major part of this issue by describing general techniques that allow to
quantify the attainable precision in metrological schemes in the presence of
uncorrelated noise. We show that the abstract geometrical structure of a
quantum channel describing the noisy evolution of a single particle dictates
then critical bounds on the ultimate quantum enhancement. Our results prove
that an infinitesimal amount of noise is enough to restrict the precision to
scale classically in the asymptotic $N$ limit, and thus constrain the maximal
improvement to a constant factor. Although for low numbers of particles the
decoherence may be ignored, for large $N$ the presence of noise heavily alters
the form of both optimal states and measurements attaining the ultimate
resolution. However, the established bounds are then typically achievable with
use of techniques natural to current experiments. In this work, we thoroughly
introduce the necessary concepts and mathematical tools lying behind
metrological tasks, including both frequentist and Bayesian estimation theory
frameworks. We provide examples of applications of the methods presented to
typical qubit noise models, yet we also discuss in detail the phase estimation

slope that is consistent with extragalactic observations. These ISM components

surface density relationship shows a steeper slope compared to that observed in

different slope is a result of the use of a constant CO-to-H2 conversion factor

constant metallicity in galaxies. We find a linear correlation between the SFR
surface density and that of the dense molecular gas.

For all plausible halo models, the best-fitting $M_{\star}/L$, normalized to
that for a Chabrier IMF, increases systematically with galaxy size and mass.
For an NFW profile, the slope of the total mass profile is non-universal,
independently of several ingredients in the modeling (e.g., halo contraction,
anisotropy, and rotation velocity in ETGs). For the most massive ($M_{\star}$ ~
$10^{11.5} \, M_{\odot}$) or largest ($R_{\rm e}$ ~ $15 \, \rm kpc$) ETGs, the

similar to those for a constant-$M/L$ profile. For a steeper concentration-mass
relation than that expected from simulations, the correlation of density slope
with galaxy mass tends to flatten, while correlations with $R_{\rm e}$ and
velocity dispersions are more robust. Our results clearly point to a
""non-homology"" in the total mass distribution of ETGs, which simulations of
galaxy formation suggest may be related to a varying role of dissipation with

cent, or ~1e-4 Msun) expands sufficiently rapidly for most neutrons to avoid
capture. This matter originates from the shocked-heated interface between the
merging NSs. Here we show that the beta-decay of these free neutrons in the
outermost ejecta powers a `precursor' to the main kilonova emission, which
peaks on a timescale of a few hours following merger at U-band magnitude ~22
(for an assumed distance of 200 Mpc). The high luminosity and blue colors of
the neutron precursor render it a potentially important counterpart to the
gravitational wave source, that may encode valuable information on the
properties of the merging binary (e.g. NS-NS versus NS-black hole) and the NS
equation of state. Future work is necessary to assess the robustness of the
fast moving ejecta and the survival of free neutrons in the face of neutrino
absorptions, although the precursor properties are robust to a moderate amount
of leptonization. Our results provide additional motivation for short latency
gravitational wave triggers and rapid follow-up searches with sensitive ground
based telescopes.

part of present day condensed matter physics. Quantum phase transitions concern
ground state properties of many-body systems, and hence their signatures are
expected to be pronounced in low-energy states. Here we report signature of a
quantum critical point manifested in strongly out-of-equilibrium states with
finite energy density with respect to the ground state and extensive
(subsystem) entanglement entropy, generated by an external pulse. These
non-equilibrium states are evidently completely disordered (e.g., paramagnetic
in case of a magnetic ordering transition). The pulse is applied by switching a
coupling of the Hamiltonian from an initial value ($\lambda_{I}$) to a final
value ($\lambda_{F}$) for sufficiently long time and back again. The signature
appears as non-analyticities (kinks) in the energy absorbed by the system from
the pulse as a function of $\lambda_{F}$ at critical-points (i.e., at values of
$\lambda_{F}$ corresponding to static critical-points of the system). As one
excites higher and higher eigenstates of the final Hamiltonian $H(\lambda_{F})$
by increasing the pulse height ($|\lambda_{I} - \lambda_{F}|$), the
non-analyticity grows stronger monotonically with it. This implies adding
contributions from higher eigenstates help magnifying the non-analyticity,
indicating strong imprint of the critical-point on them. Our findings are
grounded on exact analytical results derived for Ising and XY chains in
transverse field.

to solve challenges in demand side management, an important concept in the
upcoming smart grid. Demand side management is about modifying the energy load
distribution on the demand side, for example in order to reduce peaks in energy
usage. This can be done by shifting energy demands where possible. We start
with describing a number of smart grid concepts and assumptions (smart meters,
pricing, appliance scheduling) and explain the advantages demand side
management has. After the introduction of game theoretic concepts, it becomes
possible to mathematically describe the demand side management problem. Next
step is to solve the mathematical formulation, and show how complex demand side
management becomes if the number of energy users increases. By means of
distributed ICT algorithms however, it is possible to still find a solution.
Based on existing literature, different algorithms are studied. Though results
in literature looked promising, several conclusions on convergence of the
algorithm in general, and convergence towards the most optimal results in
particular are challenged.

standard axion potential requires us to postulate a rapid decay of most of the

averted, though, with the introduction of a slightly modified axion potential.
In either case, a Universe like ours arises in roughly 1 in 100 universes. The

parameters scanning independently. At the same time, several remarkable
coincidences are understood. Small variations in these parameters away from
their measured values lead to the instability of hydrogen, the instability of
heavy nuclei, and either a hydrogen or a helium dominated universe from Big
Bang Nucleosynthesis. In the 4d parameter space of $(m_u,m_d,m_e,v)$,
catastrophic boundaries are reached by separately increasing each parameter
above its measured value by a factor of $(1.4,1.3,2.5,\sim5)$, respectively.
The fine-tuning problem of the weak scale in the Standard Model is solved: as
$v$ is increased beyond the observed value, it is impossible to maintain a
significant cosmological hydrogen abundance for any values of $m_{u,d,e}$ that
yield both hydrogen and heavy nuclei stability.
  For very large values of $v$ a new regime is entered where weak interactions
freeze out before the QCD phase transition. The helium abundance becomes
independent of $v$ and is determined by the cosmic baryon and lepton
asymmetries. To maintain our explanation of $v$ from the anthropic cost of
helium dominance then requires universes with such large $v$ to be rare in the
multiverse. Implications of this are explored, including the possibility that
new physics below 10 TeV cuts off the fine-tuning in $v$.

relation to the triggering of the nuclear activity. The asymmetries at the
edges of the disk date the last interaction with a companion to more than 1 Gyr
ago. The tilted-ring model of the HI disk shows that this event may have formed
the disk as we see it now, but that it may have not been responsible for

involved in the triggering of the radio activity. We argue that PKS B1718-649
may belong to a family of young low-excitation radio AGN where, rather than
through a gas rich merger, the active nuclei (AGN) are triggered by local
mechanisms such as accretion of small gas clouds.

parallel by several state-of-the-art methodologies. Our aim is to present how
these analyses were implemented, to discuss their results, and to describe how
a final recommended parameter scale is defined. We also discuss the precision
(method-to-method dispersion) and accuracy (biases with respect to the

Gaia-ESO 2nd internal release and will be part of its 1st public release of
advanced data products. The final parameter scale is tied to the one defined by
the Gaia benchmark stars, a set of stars with fundamental atmospheric
parameters. A set of open and globular clusters is used to evaluate the
physical soundness of the results. Each methodology is judged against the
benchmark stars to define weights in three different regions of the parameter
space. The final recommended results are the weighted-medians of those from the
individual methods. The recommended results successfully reproduce the
benchmark stars atmospheric parameters and the expected Teff-log g relation of
the calibrating clusters. Atmospheric parameters and abundances have been
determined for 1301 FGK-type stars observed with UVES. The median of the
method-to-method dispersion of the atmospheric parameters is 55 K for Teff,
0.13 dex for log g, and 0.07 dex for [Fe/H]. Systematic biases are estimated to
be between 50-100 K for Teff, 0.10-0.25 dex for log g, and 0.05-0.10 dex for
[Fe/H]. Abundances for 24 elements were derived: C, N, O, Na, Mg, Al, Si, Ca,

extragalactic or galactic background emission aligned by chance with the target
stars. These statistical analyses do not exclude the possibility that a given
WISE excess could be due to a transient dust population associated with the

of a sample of Kepler and non-Kepler transiting-planet candidates' host stars,
with candidate WISE warm debris disks, aimed at detecting a possible cold
debris disk in any of them. No clear detections were found in any one of the
objects at either wavelength. Our upper limits confirm that most objects in the
sample do not have a massive debris disk like that in beta Pic. We also show
that the planet-hosting star WASP-33 does not have a debris disk comparable to
the one around eta Crv. Although the data cannot be used to rule out rare warm
disks around the Kepler planet-hosting candidates, the lack of detections and
the characteristics of neighboring emission found at far-IR wavelengths support
an earlier result suggesting that most of the WISE-selected IR excesses around

criticality appears in Dirac semimetals when the disorder strength becomes
sufficiently strong in the presence of Coulomb interactions so that a quantum

Near the critical point, unusually wide temperature regions with NFL behaviors

deliver important insights, but generally with resolution limited by the depth

shown as successful alternatives for modeling high dimensional multimodal
distributions. One issue associated with NADEs is that they rely on a
particular order of factorization for $P(\mathbf{x})$. This issue has been
recently addressed by a variant of NADE called Orderless NADEs and its deeper
version, Deep Orderless NADE. Orderless NADEs are trained based on a criterion
that stochastically maximizes $P(\mathbf{x})$ with all possible orders of
factorizations. Unfortunately, ancestral sampling from deep NADE is very
expensive, corresponding to running through a neural net separately predicting
each of the visible variables given some others. This work makes a connection
between this criterion and the training criterion for Generative Stochastic
Networks (GSNs). It shows that training NADEs in this way also trains a GSN,
which defines a Markov chain associated with the NADE model. Based on this
connection, we show an alternative way to sample from a trained Orderless NADE
that allows to trade-off computing time and quality of the samples: a 3 to
10-fold speedup (taking into account the waste due to correlations between
consecutive samples of the chain) can be obtained without noticeably reducing
the quality of the samples. This is achieved using a novel sampling procedure
for GSNs called annealed GSN sampling, similar to tempering methods that
combines fast mixing (obtained thanks to steps at high noise levels) with
accurate samples (obtained thanks to steps at low noise levels).

extends to this class of algorithms the deterministic model error formulation
recently explored for variational schemes and extended Kalman filter. The model
error statistic required in the analysis update is estimated using historical
reanalysis increments and a suitable model error evolution law. Two different
versions of the method are described; a time-constant model error treatment
where the same model error statistical description is time-invariant, and a
time-varying treatment where the assumed model error statistics is randomly
sampled at each analysis step. We compare both methods with the standard method
of dealing with model error through inflation and localization, and illustrate
our results with numerical simulations on a low order nonlinear system
exhibiting chaotic dynamics. The results show that the filter skill is
significantly improved through the proposed model error treatments, and that
both methods require far less parameter tuning than the standard approach.
Furthermore, the proposed approach is simple to implement within a pre-existing
ensemble based scheme. The general implications for the use of the proposed
approach in the framework of square-root filters such as the ETKF are also

band off-set (such as tungsten disulfide and related materials). The operation
of these detectors is enabled by the thermionic emissions from the GLs enhanced
by the electrons heated by incoming THz radiation. The electron heating is
primarily associated with the intraband absorption (the Drude absorption). We
calculate the responsivity and detectivity as functions of the photon energy,
GL doping, and the applied voltage for the GL detectors (GLDs) with different
number of GLs. The detectors based on the cascade multiple-GL structures can
exhibit a substantial photoelectric gain resulting in the elevated responsivity
and detectivity. The advantages of the THz detectors under consideration are
associated with their high sensitivity to the normal incident radiation and
efficient operation at room temperature at the low end of the THz frequency
range. Such GLDs with a metal grating, supporting the excitation of plasma
oscillations in the GL-structures by the incident THz radiation, can exhibit a
strong resonant response at the frequencies of several THz (in the range, where
the operation of the conventional detectors based on A$_3$B$_5$ materials, in
particular THz quantum-well detectors, is hindered due to a strong optical
phonon radiation absorption in such materials).

and heating in collisionless systems. In this paper, hybrid Vlasov-Maxwell
simulations are employed to analyze in detail the features of the kinetic
Alfv\'en waves at proton kinetic scales, in typical conditions of the solar
wind environment. In particular, linear and nonlinear regimes of propagation of
these fluctuations have been investigated in a single-wave situation, focusing
on the physical processes of collisionless Landau damping and wave-particle
resonant interaction. Interestingly, since for wavelengths close to $d_p$ and
proton plasma beta $\beta$ of order unity the kinetic Alfv\'en waves have small
phase speed compared to the proton thermal velocity, wave-particle interaction
processes produce significant deformations in the core of the particle velocity
distribution, appearing as phase space vortices and resulting in flat-top
velocity profiles. Moreover, as the Eulerian hybrid Vlasov-Maxwell algorithm
allows for a clean almost noise-free description of the velocity space,
three-dimensional plots of the proton velocity distribution help to emphasize

illustrated on the common tight-binding model for conduction electrons in

energy-loss-function spectra. The first one corresponds to the intraband
plasmons (usually called the Dirac plasmons). On the other hand, the second
maximum ($\pi$ plasmon structure) is simply a consequence of the van Hove

failures, where soft failures refer to the reaching of a given thresh-old for
the degradation level, and sudden failures to accidental failures,
characterized by a failure rate. A non-fatal shock increases both degradation
level and failure rate of a random amount, with possible dependence between the
two increments. The system reliability is calculated by four different methods.
Conditions under which the system lifetime is New Better than Used are

main objects of interest are the closely related concepts of excitation

propose a spectral point of view concerning these two concepts. In the first
part of this thesis we discuss the concepts of excitation spectrum and
quasiparticles. We provide an overview of physical motivations and based on
that we propose a spectral and Hamiltonian-based approach towards these terms.
Based on that, we formulate definitions and propositions related to these
concepts. In the second part we recall the Bogoliubov and
Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov approximations, which in the physics literature are
used to obtain the quasiparticle picture. We show how these two approaches fit
into a universal scheme which allows us to arrive at a quasiparticle picture in
a more general setup. This scheme is based on the minimization of Hamiltonians
over the so-called Gaussian states. Its abstract formulation is the content of
Beliaev's Theorem. In the last part we present a rigorous result concerning the
justification of the Bogoliubov approximation. This justification employs the
concept of the mean-field and infinite-volume limit. We show that for a large
number of particles, a large volume and a sufficiently high density, the
low-lying energy-momentum spectrum of the homogeneous Bose gas is well
described by the Bogoliubov approximation. This result, which is formulated in
the form of a theorem, can be seen as the main result of this thesis.

previously applied to individual decision makers, which we now generalize to
the case of decision makers that are members of a society. The approach employs
the mathematical techniques that are common in quantum theory, justifying our
naming as Quantum Decision Theory. However, we do not assume that decision
makers are quantum objects. The techniques of quantum theory are needed only
for defining the prospect probabilities taking into account such hidden
variables as behavioral biases and other subconscious feelings. The approach
describes an agent's choice as a probabilistic event occurring with a
probability that is the sum of a utility factor and of an attraction factor.
The attraction factor embodies subjective and unconscious dimensions in the
mind of the decision maker. We show that the typical aggregate amplitude of the
attraction factor is $1/4$, and it can be either positive or negative depending
on the relative attraction of the competing choices. The most efficient way of
varying the decision makers choice is realized by influencing the attraction
factor. This can be done in two ways. One method is to arrange in a special
manner the payoff weights, which induces the required changes of the values of
attraction factors. We show that a slight variation of the payoff weights can
invert the sign of the attraction factors and reverse the decision preferences,
even when the prospect utilities remain unchanged. The second method of
influencing the decision makers choice is by providing information to decision
makers. The methods of influencing decision making are illustrated by several
experiments, whose outcomes are compared quantitatively with the predictions of
our approach.

The orbit of a
planet around a binary stellar system poses several dynamic constraints. The
effects that radiation from the host stars may have on the planet atmospheres
must be considered. Because of the configuration of a close binary system,
these stars have a high rotation rate, which causes a permanent state of high
stellar activity and copious XUV radiation. The accumulated effects are
stronger than for exoplanets around single stars, and cause a faster
evaporation of their atmospheres. We evaluate the effects that stellar
radiation has on the evaporation of exoplanets around binary systems and on the
survival of these planets. We considered the XUV spectral range to account for
the photons that are easily absorbed by a planet atmosphere that is mainly
composed of hydrogen. A more complex atmospheric composition is expected to
absorb this radiation more efficiently. We used direct X-ray observations to
evaluate the energy in the X-rays range and coronal models to calculate the
(nondetectable) EUV part of the spectrum. The simulations show that exoplanets
in a close orbit will suffer strong photoevaporation that may cause a total
loss of atmosphere in a short time. A binary system of two solar-like stars
will be highly efficient in evaporating the atmosphere of the planet. These
systems will be difficult to find, even if they are dynamically stable. Still,
planets may orbit around binary systems of low mass stars for wider orbits.
Currently known circumbinary planets are not substantially affected by thermal
photoevaporation processes, unless Kepler-47 b has an inflated atmosphere. The
distribution of the orbital periods of circumbinary planets is shifted to much
longer periods than the average of Kepler planets, which supports a scenario of
strong photoevaporation in close-in circumbinary planets.

  In the first paper we apply our schema to construct the action of

component action can be obtained almost algorithmically by using the nonlinear
realizations approach. Within this approach, properly adapted to the
construction of on-shell component actions, we pay much attention to broken
supersymmetry. Doing so, we were able to write the action in terms of purely
geometric objects (vielbeins and covariant derivatives of the physical bosonic
components), covariant with respect to broken supersymmetry. It turns out that
all terms of the higher orders in the fermions, are hidden inside these
covariant derivatives and vielbeins. Moreover, the main part of the component
action just mimics its bosonic cousin in which the ordinary space-time
derivatives and the bosonic world volume are replaced by their covariant
supersymmetric analogs. The Wess-Zumino term in the action, which does not
exist in the bosonic case, can be also easily constructed in terms of reduced
Cartan forms. Keeping the broken supersymmetry almost explicit, one may write
the Ansatz for the component action, fully defined up to two constant
parameters. The role of the unbroken supersymmetry is just to fix these
parameters.

in the spatiotemporal structure of non-local correlation functions in the spin-

functions and the extracted length-scales show good agreement with existing
results, as do local time dependent observables at the impurity. In the
time-dependent data, we identify a major signal which defines a ""light cone""
moving at the Fermi velocity and a ferromagnetic component in its wake. Inside
the light cone we find that the structure of the nonequilibrium correlation
functions emerges on two time scales. Initially, the qualitative structure of
the correlation functions develops rapidly at the lattice Fermi velocity.
Subsequently the spin correlations converge to the equilibrium results on a
much larger time scale. This process sets a dynamic energy scale, which we
identify to be proportional to the Kondo temperature. Outside the light cone we
observe two different power law decays of the correlation functions in space,
with time and interaction strength independent exponents.

known as the \emph{equitable chromatic number} of $G$ and it is denoted by
$\chi_{=}(G)$. In this paper the problem of determinig $\chi_=$ for coronas of

of cubic graphs is solvable in polynomial time, the problem of equitable

As a by-product we obtain a simple linear time algorithm for equitable coloring

either by $N_{2,3}$-decays for masses $M_{2,3}\gtrsim$ TeV, or by
$N_{2,3}$-oscillations for $M_{2,3}\sim$ GeV. Experimental signatures of this

of this paper is to study their higher dimensional analogs. First, we introduce
a certain class of commutative Gorenstein rings $R$ graded by abelian groups
$L$ of rank $1$, which we call Geigle-Lenzing complete intersections. We study
the stable category of Cohen-Macaulay representations $CM^LR$, which coincides
with the singularity category $D_{sg}^L(R)$. We show that the stable category
of $CM^LR$ is triangle equivalent to $D^b(mod A^{CM})$ for a finite dimensional
algebra $A^{CM}$, which we call the CM-canonical algebra. As an application, we
classify the $(R,L)$ that are Cohen-Macaulay finite. We also give sufficient
conditions for $(R,L)$ to be $d$-Cohen-Macaulay finite in the sense of higher
Auslander-Reiten theory. Secondly, we study a new class of non-commutative
projective schemes in the sense of Artin-Zhang, i.e. the category $coh
X=mod^LR/mod^L_0R$ of coherent sheaves on the Geigle-Lenzing projective space
$X$. Geometrically this is the quotient stack $[(Spec R-{R_+})/Spec k[L]]$. We
show that $D^b(coh X)$ is triangle equivalent to $D^b(mod A^{ca})$ for a finite

when $X$ is $d$-vector bundle finite, and when $X$ is derived equivalent to a
$d$-representation infinite algebra in the sense of higher Auslander-Reiten

CANARIAS (GTC). The galaxy was observed in imaging mode with an angular
resolution of 0.24 arcsec (54 pc) in the Si-2 filter (8.7 micron). The image
reveals a series of star-forming knots within the central ~400 pc, after
subtracting the dominant active galactic nucleus (AGN) component. We also
subtracted this AGN unresolved component from the 8-13 micron spectra of the
knots and the nucleus, and measured equivalent widths (EWs) of the 11.3 micron
Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbon (PAH) feature which are typical of pure
starburst galaxies. This EW is larger in the nucleus than in the knots,
confirming that, at least in the case of Mrk 1066, the AGN dilutes, rather than
destroys, the molecules responsible for the 11.3 micron PAH emission. By
comparing the nuclear GTC/CC spectrum with the Spitzer/IRS spectrum of the
galaxy, we find that the AGN component that dominates the continuum emission at
wavelengths below 15 micron on scales of ~60 pc (90-100%) decreases to 35-50%
when the emission of the central ~830 pc is considered. On the other hand, the
AGN contribution dominates the 15-25 micron emission (75%) on the scales probed
by Spitzer/IRS. We find a good match between the MIR morphology of Mrk 1066 and
the extended Pab, Brg and [O III] emission. This coincidence implies that the
8.7 micron emission is probing star formation, dust in the narrow-line region,
and the oval structure previously detected in the near-infrared. On the other
hand, the Chandra soft X-ray morphology does not match any of the previous,
contrary to what it is generally assumed for Seyfert galaxies.

class of differential equations obeyed by movement paths for which $n$-th order
maximally smooth trajectories have constant rate of accumulating geometric
measurement along the drawn path. Constant rate of accumulating equi-affine arc
corresponds to compliance with the two-thirds power-law model. Geometric
measurement is invariant under a class of geometric transformations and may be
chosen to be an arc in certain geometry. Equations' solutions presumably serve
as candidates for geometric movement primitives. The derived class of
differential equations consists of two parts. The first part is identical for
all geometric parameterizations of the path. The second part enforces
consistency with desired (geometric) parametrization of curves on solutions of
the first part. Equations in different geometries in plane and in space and

time, are determined from time evolutions of the linearised dynamical equations
in Newtonian gravity. In order to analyse the instability we monitor also the
canonical energy and angular momentum. Our results demonstrate that the l=m=2
f-mode becomes unstable as soon as a co-rotation point develops inside the star
(i.e. whenever there is a point where the mode's pattern speed matches the bulk
angular velocity). Considering various degrees of differential rotation, we
show that the instability grows faster deep inside the co-rotation region and
deduce an empirical relation that correlates the mode frequency and the star's
parameters, which captures the main features of the l=m=2 f-mode growth time.
This function is proportional to the product of the kinetic to gravitational
energy ratio and the gradient of the star's spin, strengthening further the
relationship between the co-rotation point and the low T/W instability. We
briefly consider also the l=m=2 r-mode and demonstrate that it never moves far

issues, we propose a novel model by emphasizing both robust representation and
learning-based sparsity. Specifically, we apply the $\ell_{2,1}$-norm to
measure the representation error, preventing outlier channels from dominating
our objective. In this way, the side effects of outlier channels are greatly
relieved. Besides, we observe that the mixed level of each pixel varies over
image grids. Based on this observation, we exploit a learning-based sparsity
method to simultaneously learn the HU results and a sparse guidance map. Via
this guidance map, the sparsity constraint in the $\ell_{p}\!\left(\!0\!<\!

better suited to the real situation, thus expected to achieve better HU
results. The resulted objective is highly non-convex and non-smooth, and so it
is hard to optimize. As a profound theoretical contribution, we propose an
efficient algorithm to solve it. Meanwhile, the convergence proof and the
computational complexity analysis are systematically provided. Extensive
evaluations verify that our method is highly promising for the HU task---it
achieves very accurate guidance maps and much better HU results compared with

consecutive nights with the median time resolution of 2.1 minutes, have been
analyzed using the Broadening Functions method in the spectral window Doppler
images of the system reveal the presence of vigorous mass motions within the
binary system; their presence puts into question the solid-body rotation
assumption of the contact binary model. AW UMa appears to be a very tight,
semi-detached binary; the mass transfer takes place from the more massive to
the less massive component. The primary, a fast-rotating star with V sin i =
181.4+\-2.5 km s^-1, is covered by inhomogeneities: very slowly drifting spots
and a dense network of ripples more closely participating in its rotation. The
spectral lines of the primary show an additional broadening component (called
the ""pedestal"") which originates either in the equatorial regions which rotate
faster than the rest of the star by about 50 km s^-1 or in an external
disk-like structure. The secondary component appears to be smaller than
predicted by the contact model. The radial velocity field around the secondary
is dominated by accretion of matter transferred from (and possibly partly
returned to) the primary component. The parameters of the binary are: A sin i =
2.73 +/- 0.11 R_odot and M_1 sin^3 i = 1.29 +/- 0.15 M_odot, M_2 sin^3 i =
0.128 +/- 0.016 M_odot. The mass ratio q_rm sp = M_2/M_1 = 0.099 +/- 0.003,
while still the most uncertain among the spectroscopic elements, is
substantially different from the previous numerous and mutually consistent
photometric investigations which were based on the contact model. It should be
studied why photometry and spectroscopy give so very discrepant results and
whether AW UMa is an unusual object or that only very high-quality spectroscopy
can reveal the true nature of W UMa-type binaries.

transport regime and then a dynamical arrest. Here, we study the dimensional
dependence of the dynamical arrest, which can be mapped onto the void
percolation transition for Poisson-distributed point obstacles. We numerically
determine the arrest in dimensions d=2-6. Comparing the results with standard
mode-coupling theory reveals that the dynamical theory prediction grows
increasingly worse with $d$. In an effort to clarify the origin of this
discrepancy, we relate the dynamical arrest in the RLG to the dynamic glass
transition of the infinite-range Mari-Kurchan model glass former. Through a
mixed static and dynamical analysis, we then extract an improved dimensional
scaling form as well as a geometrical upper bound for the arrest. The results
suggest that understanding the asymptotic behavior of the random Lorentz gas

$1.51\pm0.07$, which is shallower by $4.8\sigma$ than the value derived when

are cool, evolved subgiants and stars lying at the base of the red-giant
branch. These stars would ordinarily be studied using the short-cadence (SC)
data, since the associated SC Nyquist frequency lies well above the frequencies
of the detectable oscillations. However, the number of available SC target
slots is quite limited. This imposes a severe restriction on the size of the
ensemble available for SC asteroseismic study.We find that archival Kepler LC
data from the nominal Mission may be utilized for asteroseismic studies of
targets whose dominant oscillation frequencies lie as high as approximately 500
{\mu}Hz, i.e., about 1.75- times the LC Nyquist frequency. The frequency
detection threshold for the shorter-duration science campaigns of the
re-purposed Kepler Mission, K2, is lower. The maximum threshold will probably
lie somewhere between approximately 400 and 450 {\mu}Hz. The potential to
exploit the archival Kepler and K2 LC data in this manner opens the door to
increasing significantly the number of subgiant and low-luminosity red-giant
targets amenable to asteroseismic analysis, overcoming target limitations
imposed by the small number of SC slots.We estimate that around 400 such
targets are now available for study in the Kepler LC archive. That number could
potentially be a lot higher for K2, since there will be a new target list for
each of its campaigns.

advertising. Simply, an ad option is a first look contract in which a publisher

transactions to purchase impressions or clicks from a specific ad slot at a
pre-specified price on a specific delivery date. Such a structure provides
advertisers with more flexibility of their guaranteed deliveries. The valuation
of ad options is an important topic and previous studies on ad options pricing
have been mostly restricted to the situations where the underlying prices
follow a geometric Brownian motion (GBM). This assumption is reasonable for
sponsored search; however, some studies have also indicated that it is not
valid for display advertising. In this paper, we address this issue by
employing a stochastic volatility (SV) model and discuss a lattice framework to
approximate the proposed SV model in option pricing. Our developments are
validated by experiments with real advertising data: (i) we find that the SV
model has a better fitness over the GBM model; (ii) we validate the proposed
lattice model via two sequential Monte Carlo simulation methods; (iii) we
demonstrate that advertisers are able to flexibly manage their guaranteed
deliveries by using the proposed options, and publishers can have an increased
revenue when some of their inventories are sold via ad options.

from the Skellam distribution if quantum statistical correlation is taken into
account at high baryon density, but this effect is not strong enough to explain
fluctuation data seen in the beam-energy scan at RHIC/STAR. In the calculation
of mean-field nuclear matter the density correlation with the vector
$\omega$-field rather than the effective mass with the scalar $\sigma$-field
renders the kurtosis suppressed at higher baryon density so as to account for
the experimentally observed behavior of the kurtosis. We finally discuss the
difference between the baryon number and the proton number fluctuations from
correlation effects in isospin space. The numerical results suggest that such
effects are only minor even in the case of complete randomization of isospin.

formation and evolution. The development of high-contrast imaging techniques in
the past 20 years is now allowing the detection of faint material around bright
stars with high angular resolution, hence opening an avenue to study in detail
the structures of circumstellar disks and their relation to planetary
formation.
  Aims. The purpose of this paper is to revisit the morphology of the almost
edge-on debris disk around HD 15115.
  Methods. We analyzed data from the Gemini science archive obtained in 2009
and 2011 with the Near-Infrared Coronagraphic Imager instrument in the H and Ks
bands using coronagraphy and angular differential imaging tech- niques.
  Results. We resolved the disk in both the H and Ks bands. We confirmed the
position angles inferred by previous authors, as well as the brightness
asymmetry, which is the origin of the object's nickname, the blue needle. We
were able to detect the bow-like shape of the disk suspected from other
observations. However, these new NICI images suggest the presence of a highly
inclined ring-like disk of which we see the brighter side and the ansae located
at 90 AU symmetrically about the star. The inner part is likely depleted of
dust. The fainter side of the disk is suspected but not firmly detected, which
also indicates a large anisotropic scattering factor.
  Conclusions. The morphological symmetry of the disk contrasts with the
obvious brightness asymmetry. This asymmetry may be explained by the
coexistence of several types of grains in this disk and/or variable dust
density. Interaction with the interstellar medium was invoked by previous
authors as a possible explanation but other mechanisms may account for the
brightness asymmetry, for instance a recent collision in the disk

model is capable of reproducing the observed cluster pressure profile at
redshift, z~0, once the AGN heating temperature of the targeted particles is
made to scale with the final virial temperature of the halo. This allows the
ejected gas to reach larger radii in higher-mass clusters than would be
possible had a fixed heating temperature been used. Such a model also
successfully reduces the star formation rate in brightest cluster galaxies and
broadly reproduces a number of other observational properties at low redshift,
including baryon, gas and star fractions; entropy profiles outside the core;
and the X-ray luminosity-mass relation. Our results are consistent with the
notion that the excess entropy is generated via selective removal of the
densest material through radiative cooling; supernova and AGN feedback largely
serve as regulation mechanisms, moving heated gas out of galaxies and away from
cluster cores. However, our simulations fail to address a number of serious
issues; for example, they are incapable of reproducing the shape and diversity
of the observed entropy profiles within the core region. We also show that the
stellar and black hole masses are sensitive to numerical resolution,
particularly the gravitational softening length; a smaller value leads to more
efficient black hole growth at early times and a smaller central galaxy.

estimation of change-points leads to curious asymptotic phenomena. When the
change-point model is correctly specified, such estimates generally converge at
a fast rate ($n$) and are asymptotically described by minimizers of jump

studied in an isospin asymmetric, strange, hot and dense hadronic environment

for the light quark sector, is generalized to include the heavy quark sector
($c$ and $b$) to derive the interactions of the $B$ and ${\bar B}$ mesons with
the light hadrons. Due to large mass of bottom quark, we use only the empirical
form of these interactions for the desired purpose, while treating the bottom
degrees of freedom to be frozen in the medium. Hence, all medium effects are
due to the in-medium interaction of the light quark content of these
open-bottom mesons. Both $B$ and $\bar B$ mesons are found to experience net
attractive interactions in the medium, leading to lowering of their masses in
the medium. The mass degeneracy of particles and antiparticles, ($B^+$, $B^-$)
as well as ($B^0$, $\bar {B^0}$), is observed to be broken in the medium, due
to equal and opposite contributions from a vectorial Weinberg-Tomozawa
interaction term. Addition of hyperons to the medium lowers further the
in-medium mass for each of these four mesons, while a non-zero isospin
asymmetry is observed to break the approximate mass degeneracy of each pair of
isospin doublets. These medium effects are found to be strongly density
dependent, and bear a considerably weaker temperature dependence. The results
obtained in the present investigation are compared to predictions from the

  algorithm",,,,,"math.DS math.NT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The binary Euclidean algorithm is a modification of the classical Euclidean
algorithm for computation of greatest common divisors which avoids ordinary
integer division in favour of division by powers of two only. The expectation
of the number of steps taken by the binary Euclidean algorithm when applied to
pairs of integers of bounded size was first investigated by R. P. Brent in 1976
via a heuristic model of the algorithm as a random dynamical system. Based on
numerical investigations of the expectation of the associated Ruelle transfer
operator, Brent obtained a conjectural asymptotic expression for the mean
number of steps performed by the algorithm when processing pairs of odd
integers whose size is bounded by a large integer. In 1998 B. Vall\'ee modified
Brent's model via an induction scheme to rigorously prove an asymptotic formula
for the average number of steps performed by the algorithm; however, the
relationship of this result with Brent's heuristics remains conjectural. In
this article we establish previously conjectural properties of Brent's transfer
operator, showing directly that it possesses a spectral gap and preserves a
unique continuous density. This density is shown to extend holomorphically to
the complex right half-plane and to have a logarithmic singularity at zero. By
combining these results with methods from classical analytic number theory we
prove the correctness of three conjectured formulae for the expected number of
steps, resolving several open questions promoted by D. E. Knuth in The Art of
Computer Programming.

The heating efficiency is defined as the ratio of the net local
gas-heating rate to the rate of stellar radiative energy absorption. It plays
an important role in thermal-escape processes from the upper atmospheres of
planets that are exposed to stellar soft X-rays and extreme ultraviolet
radiation (XUV). Aims. We model the thermal-escape-related heating efficiency
of the stellar XUV radiation in the hydrogen-dominated upper atmosphere of the
extrasolar gas giant HD 209458b. The model result is then compared with
previous thermal-hydrogen-escape studies which assumed heating efficiency
values between 10-100%. Methods. The photolytic and electron impact processes
in the thermosphere were studied by solving the kinetic Boltzmann equation and
applying a Direct Simulation Monte Carlo model. We calculated the energy
deposition rates of the stellar XUV flux and that of the accompanying primary
photoelectrons that are caused by electron impact processes in the H2 to H
transition region in the upper atmosphere. Results. The heating by XUV
radiation of hydrogen-dominated upper atmospheres does not reach higher than
20% above the main thermosphere altitude, if the participation of photoelectron
impact processes is included. Conclusions. Hydrogen-escape studies from
exoplanets that assume heating efficiency values that are >= 20 % probably
overestimate the thermal escape or mass-loss rates, while those who assumed
values that are < 20% probably produce more realistic atmospheric-escape rates.

additional restrictions (called uniformity conditions) apply to combinations of
atomic formulas with two or more variables. The fragment can be seen as a
canonical generalization of two-variable logic, defined in order to be able to
deal with relations of arbitrary arities. The fragment was introduced recently,
and it was shown that the satisfiability problem of the equality-free fragment
of UF1^= is decidable. In this article we establish that the satisfiability and
finite satisfiability problems of UF1^= are NEXPTIME-complete. We also show
that the corresponding problems for the extension of UF1^= with counting

the expressivities of UF1^= and two-variable logic with counting quantifiers

strictly contained in FOC^2 when attention is restricted to vocabularies with

Two-Step Matching process for reducing the response time of the CBIR systems.
Further, we develop a Meta-Learning framework for improving the retrieval
performance of these systems. Our results show that the Two-Step Matching
process significantly reduces response time and the Meta-Learning Framework
improves the retrieval performance by more than two fold. We also analyze the
performance of various image classification systems that use different image
representations constructed from the local feature vectors.

that the EWPT in the model is a sequence of two first-order phase transitions,
$SU(3) \rightarrow SU(2)$ at the TeV scale and $SU(2) \rightarrow U(1)$ at the
$100$ GeV scale. The EWPT $SU(3) \rightarrow SU(2)$ is triggered by the new
bosons and the exotic quarks; its strength is about $1 - 13$ if the mass ranges
of these new particles are $10^2 \,\mathrm{GeV} - 10^3 \,\mathrm{GeV}$. The
EWPT $SU(2) \rightarrow U(1)$ is strengthened by only the new bosons; its
strength is about $1 - 1.15$ if the mass parts of $H^0_1$, $H^\pm_2$ and
$Y^\pm$ are in the ranges $10 \,\mathrm{GeV} - 10^2 \,\mathrm{GeV}$. The
contributions of $H^0_1$ and $H^{\pm}_2$ to the strengths of both EWPTs may
make them sufficiently strong to provide large deviations from thermal
equilibrium and B violation necessary for baryogenesis.

While such properties are used to obtain new results about sliced inverse

and individual memory. In this paper we investigate the potential contribution
of agent-based modelling and simulation when contrasted with stochastic
versions of ODE models using early-stage cancer examples. We seek answers to
the following questions: (1) Does this new stochastic formulation produce
similar results to the agent-based version? (2) Can these methods be used
interchangeably? (3) Do agent-based models outcomes reveal any benefit when
compared to the Gillespie results? To answer these research questions we
investigate three well-established mathematical models describing interactions
between tumour cells and immune elements. These case studies were
re-conceptualised under an agent-based perspective and also converted to the
Gillespie algorithm formulation. Our interest in this work, therefore, is to
establish a methodological discussion regarding the usability of different
simulation approaches, rather than provide further biological insights into the
investigated case studies. Our results show that it is possible to obtain
equivalent models that implement the same mechanisms; however, the incapacity
of the Gillespie algorithm to retain individual memory of past events affects
the similarity of some results. Furthermore, the emergent behaviour of ABMS
produces extra patters of behaviour in the system, which was not obtained by
the Gillespie algorithm.

visualizing these samples can be challenging. Consensus trees often provide
limited information about a sample, and so methods such as consensus networks,
clustering and multidimensional scaling have been developed and applied to tree
samples. This paper describes a stochastic algorithm for constructing a
principal geodesic or line through treespace which is analogous to the first
principal component in standard Principal Components Analysis. A principal
geodesic summarizes the most variable features of a sample of trees, in terms
of both tree topology and branch lengths, and it can be visualized as an
animation of smoothly changing trees. The algorithm performs a stochastic
search through parameter space for a geodesic which minimises the sum of
squared projected distances of the data points. This procedure aims to identify
the globally optimal principal geodesic, though convergence to locally optimal
geodesics is possible. The methodology is illustrated by constructing principal
geodesics for experimental and simulated data sets, demonstrating the insight
into samples of trees that can be gained and how the method improves on a
previously published approach. A java package called GeoPhytter for
constructing and visualising principal geodesics is freely available from

basis for creating data classification systems. Testing is carried out using
three popular (multiple attribute) benchmark datasets that have two, three and
four classes. In each case, a subset of the available data is used for training
to establish thresholds, limits or likelihoods of class membership for each
attribute, and hence create mass functions that establish probability of class
membership for each attribute of the test data. Classification of each data
item is achieved by combination of these probabilities via Dempster's Rule of
Combination. Results for the first two datasets show extremely high
classification accuracy that is competitive with other popular methods. The
third dataset is non-numerical and difficult to classify, but good results can
be achieved provided the system and mass functions are designed carefully and
the right attributes are chosen for combination. In all cases the
Dempster-Shafer method provides comparable performance to other more popular
algorithms, but the overhead of generating accurate mass functions increases
the complexity with the addition of new attributes. Overall, the results
suggest that the D-S approach provides a suitable framework for the design of
classification systems and that automating the mass function design and
calculation would increase the viability of the algorithm for complex
classification problems.

correspond to photospheric helicities of both signs in approximately equal

significant correlations between the temporal profiles of the subsurface and
photospheric helicities. In these cases, the sign of the linear correlation
coefficient matches the sign relationship between the helicities, indicating
that the photospheric magnetic field twist is sensitive to the twisting motions

frame of the given null curve, we present the surface as a linear combination
of this frame and analysed the necessary and sufficient condition for that
curve to satisfy the asymptotic requirement. We illustrate the method by giving
some examples.

  admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:1408.3110",,,,"cs.NI","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/","  Energy conservation of sensor nodes for increasing the network life is the
most crucial design goal while developing efficient routing protocol for
wireless sensor networks. Recent technological advances help in the development
of wide variety of sensor nodes. Heterogeneity takes the advantage of different
types of sensor nodes and improves the energy efficiency and network life.
Generally sensors are deployed randomly and densely in a sensing region so
short distance multihop communication reduces the long distance transmission in
the sensor network. In this research paper MEEP (multihop energy efficient
protocol for heterogeneous sensor network) is proposed. The proposed protocol
combines the idea of clustering and multihop communication. Heterogeneity is
created in the network by using some nodes of high energy. Low energy nodes use
a residual energy based scheme to become a cluster head. High energy nodes act
as the relay nodes for low energy cluster head when they are not performing the
duty of a cluster head to save their energy further. Protocol also suggests a
sleep state for nodes in the cluster formation process for saving energy and
increasing the life of sensor network. Simulation result shows that the
proposed scheme is better than other two level heterogeneous sensor network
protocol like SEP in energy efficiency and network life.

functions on the unit disk of the complex plane is established. The expression
of the Fourier coefficients is derived from the structure of complex analysis.
The orthogonality and completeness relations of the Fourier basis are derived
in the same way. It is shown that the limiting function of any Fourier series
is also the limit to the unit circle of an analytic function in the open unit
disk. An alternative way to recover the original real functions from the
Fourier coefficients, which works even when the Fourier series are divergent,
is thus presented. The convergence issues are discussed up to a certain point.
Other possible uses of the correspondence established are pointed out.

predictions regarding future climate changes. A simple mass conservation
analysis presented here generates tight estimations for the atmosphere's
retention time constant. The analysis uses a leaky integrator model that
combines the observed deficit (only less than 40% of CO2 produced from
combustion of fossil fuels is actually retained in the atmosphere, while more
than 60% is continuously shed) with the exponential growth of fossil fuel
burning. It reveals a maximum characteristic time of less than 23 year for the
transfer of atmospheric CO2 to a segregation sink. This time constant is
further constrained by the rapid disappearance of 14C after the ban of
atmospheric atomic bomb tests, which provides a lower limit of 18 years for
this transfer. The study also generates evaluations of other CO2 fluxes,
exchange time constants and volumes exchanged. Analysis of large harmonic
oscillations of atmospheric CO2 concentration, often neglected in the
literature, indicate a strong. fast, time varying flux in and out of the
atmosphere, with an exchange time constant of little more than one month. The
correlation of oscillation amplitude with landmass distribution indicates that
this oscillation may have a predominantly terrestrial origin. It is predicted
that if the increase of anthropogenic CO2 production is halted, the CO2
concentration will stabilize within a quarter century.

  Many routing algorithms are proposed for heterogeneous wireless sensor

this category. In this research paper a novel energy efficient distance based
cluster protocol (DBCP) is proposed for single hop heterogeneous wireless

simultaneously encode the two channels of a stereo signal is illustrated. From
the modulated stream, the two channels can be recovered with minimal processing
and no cross-talk. Notably, demultiplexing does not affect the sample-depth so
that, after it, one still has a data stream suitable for directly driving a
power bridge and convertible into analog by mere low-pass filtering.
Furthermore, the approach is very flexible and if one channel is unused, it
lets the other get improved dynamic range and SNR. The approach can take
advantage of recent techniques for the design of {\Delta}{\Sigma} modulators,
including methods for psychoacoustically optimal distribution of quantization
noise. Code is available to replicate the proposed examples and as a general
computer aided design tool.

equation), but the Riemann tensor ${R_{iklm}}$ provides the most general
description of the space geometry. If ${{R_{il}}=0}$ (the space empty with

${{R_{iklm}}={C_{iklm}}} $ . The tensor ${C_{iklm}}$ is the Weyl tensor, which
disappears by conversion:${{R_{il}}={g^{km}}{R_{iklm}}}$ and we lose all
information about the space structure, which is described by ${C_{iklm}}$ .The
symmetry of ${R_{il}}$ provides the existents of gravitational waves with the
spin s=2. We show that ${C_{iklm}}$ describes gravitational waves with s=1.
Such gravitational waves can be created in inhomogeneous media, where the
selected directions are determined by derivates of the energy-momentum tensor
${T^m}_{i,k}$ of matter. It is taken into account that gravitation is described
not only by the metric tensor $g^{ik} = (1/2)(\gamma^i \gamma^k + \gamma^k
\gamma^i)$, but also by the anti-symmetric tensor $\sigma^{ik} =
(i/2)({\gamma^i}{\gamma^k} - {\gamma^k}{\gamma^i})$, where ${\gamma^k}(x)$ are
Clifford matrices. We show that the tensor ${K_{ik}} = (1/4){\sigma^{lm}}
