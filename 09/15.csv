sufficient quality in both photonic and spin properties remains a challenge for
this pursuit. The silicon-vacancy center has recently attracted a lot of
interest due to its spin-accessible optical transitions and the quality of its

for the suitability of this center as a spin-photon quantum interface. Here, we
report all-optical generation of coherent superpositions of spin states in the
ground state of a negatively charged silicon-vacancy center using coherent
population trapping. Our measurements reveal a characteristic spin coherence

  a time-dependent density-functional scheme",,,,,"physics.optics physics.atom-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  High harmonic generation (HHG) provides a flexible framework for the
development of coherent light sources in the extreme-ultraviolet and soft x-ray
regimes. However it suffers from low conversion efficiencies as the control of
the HHG spectral and temporal characteristics requires manipulating electron
trajectories on attosecond time scale. The phase matching mechanism has been
employed to selectively enhance specific quantum paths leading to HHG. A few
important fundamental questions remain open, among those how much of the
enhancement can be achieved by the single-emitter and what is the role of
correlations (or the electronic structure) in the selectivity and control of
HHG generation. Here we address those questions by examining computationally
the possibility of optimizing the HHG spectrum of isolated Hydrogen and Helium
atoms by shaping the slowly varying envelope of a 800 nm, 200-cycles long laser
pulse. The spectra are computed with a fully quantum mechanical description, by
explicitly computing the time-dependent dipole moment of the systems using a
first-principles time-dependent density-functional approach (exact for the case
of H). The sought optimization corresponds to the selective enhancement of
single harmonics, which we find to be significant. This selectivity is entirely
due to the single atom response, and not due to any propagation or
phase-matching effect. In fact, this single-emitter enhancement adds to the
phase-matching techniques to achieving even larger HHG enhancement factors.
Moreover, we see that the electronic correlation plays a role in the
determining the degree of optimization that can be obtained.

that in the case where the gravitational Lagrangian is expandable in a power

non-singular while respecting certain energy conditions in the matter fields.
Thus the black hole singularity may be removed and the gravitational equations

gravitational $f(T)$ Lagrangians which are Taylor expandable in powers of $T$

black holes can be rendered non-singular in $f(T)$ theory, we conjecture that a
mild singularity theorem holds in that the dominant energy condition is
violated in an arbitrarily small neighborhood of the general relativity

includes a multipole-field interaction, which leads to established

field, which is often neglected. However, spectroscopy using the quadratic
(ponderomotive) interaction promises two significant advantages over
spectroscopy using the multipole-field interaction: flexible transition rules
and vastly improved spatial addressability of the quantum system. For the first
time, we demonstrate ponderomotive spectroscopy by using
optical-lattice-trapped Rydberg atoms, pulsating the lattice light at a
microwave frequency, and driving a microwave atomic transition that would
otherwise be forbidden by established spectroscopic selection rules. This new
ability to measure frequencies of previously inaccessible transitions makes
possible improved determinations of atomic characteristics and constants
underlying physics. In the spatial domain, the resolution of ponderomotive
spectroscopy is orders of magnitude better than the transition frequency (and
the corresponding diffraction limit) would suggest, promising single-site
addressability in a dense particle array for quantum control and computing
applications. Future advances in technology may allow ponderomotive
spectroscopy to be extended to ground-state atoms and trapped molecules.

self-doping effect, i.e. 0.25 electrons per unit cell are transferred from the
FeAs layer to the Ti2As2O layer, leaving the FeAs layer in a hole-doped state.
This exotic behavior is successfully reproduced by our dynamical mean field
calculations, in which the self-doping effect is attributed to the electronic
correlations in the Fe 3d shell. Our work provides an alternative route of
effective doping without element substitution for iron-based superconductors.

  model",,,,,"cs.DS cs.CG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Facility location problems are captivating both from theoretical and
practical point of view. In this paper, we study some fundamental facility
location problems from the space-efficient perspective. Here the input is
considered to be given in a read-only memory and only constant amount of
work-space is available during the computation. This {\em constant-work-space
model} is well-motivated for handling big-data as well as for computing in
smart portable devices with small amount of extra-space.
  First, we propose a strategy to implement prune-and-search in this model. As
a warm up, we illustrate this technique for finding the Euclidean 1-center
constrained on a line for a set of points in $\IR^2$. This method works even if
the input is given in a sequential access read-only memory. Using this we show
how to compute (i) the Euclidean 1-center of a set of points in $\IR^2$, and
(ii) the weighted 1-center and weighted 2-center of a tree network. The running
time of all these algorithms are $O(n~poly(\log n))$. While the result of (i)
gives a positive answer to an open question asked by Asano, Mulzer, Rote and
Wang in 2011, the technique used can be applied to other problems which admit
solutions by prune-and-search paradigm. For example, we can apply the technique
to solve two and three dimensional linear programming in $O(n~poly(\log n))$
time in this model. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first
sub-quadratic time algorithms for all the above mentioned problems in the
constant-work-space model. We also present optimal linear time algorithms for
finding the centroid and weighted median of a tree in this model.

Fraunhofer regime our asymptotics reduce to the classical ones. The approach is
based on the observation that Bessel's equation admits a non-oscillatory phase
function, and uses classical formulas to obtain an asymptotic expansion for
this function; this in turn leads to both an analytical tool and a numerical
scheme for the efficient evaluation of $J_\nu(z)$, $Y_\nu(z)$, as well as
various related quantities. The effectiveness of the technique is demonstrated
via several numerical examples. We also observe that the procedure admits

active topics in computer vision recently. In this work, we apply DCNs as
frame-based recognizers for video recognition. Our preliminary studies,
however, show that video corpora with complete ground truth are usually not
large and diverse enough to learn a robust model. The networks trained directly
on the video data set suffer from significant overfitting and have poor
recognition rate on the test set. The same lack-of-training-sample problem
limits the usage of deep models on a wide range of computer vision problems
where obtaining training data are difficult. To overcome the problem, we
perform transfer learning from images to videos to utilize the knowledge in the
weakly labeled image corpus for video recognition. The image corpus help to
learn important visual patterns for natural images, while these patterns are
ignored by models trained only on the video corpus. Therefore, the resultant
networks have better generalizability and better recognition rate. We show that
by means of transfer learning from image to video, we can learn a frame-based
recognizer with only 4k videos. Because the image corpus is weakly labeled, the
entire learning process requires only 4k annotated instances, which is far less
than the million scale image data sets required by previous works. The same
approach may be applied to other visual recognition tasks where only scarce
training data is available, and it improves the applicability of DCNs in
various computer vision problems. Our experiments also reveal the correlation
between meta-parameters and the performance of DCNs, given the properties of
the target problem and data. These results lead to a heuristic for
meta-parameter selection for future researches, which does not rely on the time

efficient calculation of the total energy of realistic correlated electron

basis set within the projector augmented wave method enabling study of systems
with large, complex unit cells. The dynamical mean field portion of the
calculation is formulated using maximally localized Wannier functions, enabling
a convenient implementation which is independent of the basis set used in the
density functional portion of the calculation. The importance of using a
correct double counting term is demonstrated. A generalized form of the
standard double counting correction, which we refer to as the $U^\prime$ form,
is described in detail and used. For comparison the density functional plus U
method is implemented within the same framework including the generalized
double counting. The formalism is validated via a calculation of the
metal-insulator and structural phase diagrams of the rare-earth nickelate
perovskites as functions of applied pressure and A-site rare-earth ions. The
calculated density functional plus dynamical mean field results are found to be
consistent with experiment. The density functional plus U method is shown to
grossly overestimate the tendency for bond-disproportionation and insulating

community to return to equilibrium after small perturbation. While many
advances show how the network structure of these communities severely
constrains such tendencies, few if any of these advances address one of the
most fundamental properties of network structure: heterogeneity among nodes
with different numbers of links. Here we systematically explore this property
of ""degree heterogeneity"" and find that its effects on stability systematically
vary with different types of interspecific interactions. Degree heterogeneity
is always destabilizing in ecological networks with both competitive and
mutualistic interactions while its effects on networks of predator-prey
interactions such as food webs depend on prey contiguity, i.e., the extent to
which the species consume an unbroken sequence of prey in community niche
space. Increasing degree heterogeneity stabilizes food webs except those with
the most contiguity. These findings help explain previously unexplained
observations that food webs are highly but not completely contiguous and, more
broadly, deepens our understanding of the stability of complex ecological
networks with important implications for other types of dynamical systems.

to quantitatively measure different aspects of the network, these metrics can
give insights into the underlying network structure and function. In this work,
we connect network metrics to modern probabilistic machine learning. We focus
on the centrality metric, which is used a wide variety of applications from web
search to gene-analysis. First, we formulate an eigenvector-based Bayesian
centrality model for determining node importance. Compared to existing methods,
our probabilistic model allows for the assimilation of multiple edge weight
observations, the inclusion of priors and the extraction of uncertainties. To
enable tractable inference, we develop a variational lower bound (VBC) that is
demonstrated to be effective on a variety of networks (two synthetic and five
real-world graphs). We then bridge this model to sparse Gaussian processes. The
sparse variational Bayesian centrality Gaussian process (VBC-GP) learns a
mapping between node attributes to latent centrality and hence, is capable of
predicting centralities from node features and can potentially represent a
large number of nodes using only a limited number of inducing inputs.
Experiments show that the VBC-GP learns high-quality mappings and compares
favorably to a two-step baseline, i.e., a full GP trained on the node
attributes and pre-computed centralities. Finally, we present two case-studies
using the VBC-GP: first, to ascertain relevant features in a taxi transport
network and second, to distribute a limited number of vaccines to mitigate the
severity of a viral outbreak.

the highest expected gain in information about the classes of a set of

the use of parallel processing. Based upon this approach, we introduce new

mission with the aim of detecting gravitational waves from massive black holes,
extreme mass ratio inspirals (EMRIs) and galactic compact binaries, together
with testing relativistic gravity and probing dark energy and cosmology.
Mission orbits of the 3 spacecrafts forming a nearly equilateral triangular
array are chosen to be near the Sun-Earth Lagrange points L3, L4 and L5. The 3
spacecrafts range interferometrically with one another with arm length about
260 million kilometers. For 260 times longer arm length, the detection
sensitivity of ASTROD-GW is 260 fold better than that of eLISA/NGO in the lower
frequency region by assuming the same acceleration noise. Therefore, ASTROD-GW
will be a better cosmological probe. In previous papers, we have worked out the
time delay interferometry (TDI) for the ecliptic formation. To resolve the
reflection ambiguity about the ecliptic plane in source position determination,
we have changed the basic formation into slightly inclined formation with
half-year precession-period. In this paper, we optimize a set of 10-year
inclined ASTROD-GW mission orbits numerically using ephemeris framework

configurations for the different inclinations, and compare/analyse the
numerical results to attain the requisite sensitivity of ASTROD-GW by
suppressing laser frequency noise below the secondary noises. To explicate our

electrolytes using our theory that is based on the competition of ion-ion (II)
and ion-water (IW) interactions (Vincze et al., J. Chem. Phys. 133, 154507,
2010). The II term is computed from Grand Canonical Monte Carlo simulations on
the basis of the implicit solvent model of electrolytes using hard sphere ions
with Pauling radii. The IW term is computed on the basis of Born's treatment of
solvation using experimental hydration free energies. The two terms are coupled
through the concentration-dependent dielectric constant of the electrolyte.
With this approach we are able to reproduce the nonmonotonic concentration
dependence of the mean activity coefficient of pure electrolytes qualitatively
without using adjustable parameters. In this paper, we show that the theory can
provide valuable insight into the behavior of individual activity coefficients
too. We compare our theoretical predictions against experimental data measured
by electrochemical cells containing ion-specific electrodes. As in the case of
the mean activity coefficients, we find good agreement for 2:1 electrolytes,
while the accuracy of our model is worse for 1:1 systems. This deviation in
accuracy is explained by the fact that the two competing terms (II and IW) are
much larger in the 2:1 case so errors in the two separate terms have less
effects. The difference of the excess chemical potentials of cations and anions
(the ratio of activity coefficients) is determined by asymmetries in the
properties of the two ions: charge, radius, and hydration free energies.

the first two pairings coincide. In the second part of the paper, we show that
they are both computed as the indices of Fredholm pairs (defined here in an
algebraic sense) of operators acting on the same spaces. We construct index
functions $f_X$ for any finite length Harish-Chandra module $X$. These
functions are very cuspidal in the sense of Labesse, and their orbital
integrals on elliptic elements coincide with the character of $X$. From this we
deduce that the Dirac index pairing coincide with the elliptic pairing. These

Cepheids observed in 23 galaxies to derive the distance modulus (DM) of these
galaxies based on the frequency distributions of their periods and intrinsic
apparent magnitudes. The DM is the difference between the apparent magnitude
for extragalactic Cepheids and the absolute magnitude of the galactic Cepheids
at maximum number. It is calculated by using the comparison of the period
distribution of Cepheids in our galaxy and in other galaxies. This method is
preferred due to its simplicity to use and its efficiency in providing reliable
DM. A linear fit with correlation coefficient of 99.68% has been found between
the published distance modulus and that computed one in the present work. From
the present sample, a value of H0 in the range of 66 to 80 +/- 5 km/s Mpc is
determined. The present procedure of computation and its accuracy are confirmed

Several upcoming helioseismology space missions are very limited in
telemetry and will have to perform extensive data compression. This requires
the development of new methods of data compression.
  Aims. We give an overview of the influence of lossy data compression on local
helioseismology. We investigate the effects of several lossy compression
methods (quantization, JPEG compression, and smoothing and subsampling) on
power spectra and time-distance measurements of supergranulation flows at disk
center.
  Methods. We applied different compression methods to tracked and remapped
Dopplergrams obtained by the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager onboard the Solar
Dynamics Observatory. We determined the signal-to-noise ratio of the travel
times computed from the compressed data as a function of the compression
efficiency.
  Results. The basic helioseismic measurements that we consider are very robust
to lossy data compression. Even if only the sign of the velocity is used,
time-distance helioseismology is still possible. We achieve the best results by
applying JPEG compression on spatially subsampled data. However, our
conclusions are only valid for supergranulation flows at disk center and may
not be valid for all helioseismology applications.

and integrative processes in distributed cortical networks. Patterns of
zero-lag synchrony likely underpin numerous perceptual and cognitive functions.
Synchronization fulfils integration by reducing entropy, whilst adaptive
function mandates that a broad variety of stable states be readily accessible.
Here, we elucidate two complementary influences on patterns of zero-lag
synchrony that derive from basic properties of brain networks. First, mutually
coupled pairs of neuronal subsystems -- resonance pairs -- promote stable
zero-lag synchrony amongst the small motifs in which they are embedded, and
whose effects can propagate along connected chains. Second, frustrated
closed-loop motifs disrupt synchronous dynamics, enabling metastable
configurations of zero-lag synchrony to coexist. We document these two
complementary influences in small motifs and illustrate how these effects
underpin stable versus metastable phase-synchronization patterns in
prototypical modular networks and in large-scale cortical networks of the
macaque (CoCoMac). We find that the variability of synchronization patterns
depends on the inter-node time delay, increases with the network size, and is
maximized for intermediate coupling strengths. We hypothesize that the
dialectic influences of resonance versus frustration may form a dynamic
substrate for flexible neuronal integration, an essential platform across
diverse cognitive processes.

represent one of the best tracers of accretion processes in the still poorly
understood early phases of high-mass star formation. Previous studies suggested
that the SiO abundance decreases with the evolution of a massive young stellar
object probably because of a decay of jet activity, as witnessed in low-mass
star-forming regions. We investigate the SiO excitation conditions and its
abundance in outflows from a sample of massive young stellar objects through
observations of the SiO(8-7) and CO(4-3) lines with the APEX telescope. Through
a non-LTE analysis, we find that the excitation conditions of SiO increase with
the velocity of the emitting gas. We also compute the SiO abundance through the
SiO and CO integrated intensities at high velocities. For the sources in our
sample we find no significant variation of the SiO abundance with evolution for
a bolometric luminosity-to-mass ratio of between 4 and 50 $L_\odot/M_\odot$. We
also find a weak increase of the SiO(8-7) luminosity with the bolometric
luminosity-to-mass ratio. We speculate that this might be explained with an
increase of density in the gas traced by SiO. We find that the densities
constrained by the SiO observations require the use of shock models that
include grain-grain processing. For the first time, such models are compared
and found to be compatible with SiO observations. A pre-shock density of
$10^5\, $cm$^{-3}$ is globally inferred from these comparisons. Shocks with a
velocity higher than 25 km s$^{-1}$ are invoked for the objects in our sample
where the SiO is observed with a corresponding velocity dispersion. Our
comparison of shock models with observations suggests that sputtering of
silicon-bearing material (corresponding to less than 10% of the total silicon
abundance) from the grain mantles is occurring.

the mean synaptic strength along the critical manifold and an equally universal
$1/\sqrt{t}$ relaxation at the tricritical point, to be contrasted with the
exponential relaxation that is otherwise generic. In turn, this leads to the
natural emergence of long- and short-term memory from different parts of

observations at sub-millimetre and longer wavelengths. The Herschel Space
Observatory and complementary ground-based observations presented in this paper
have the unprecedented potential to reveal the structure and kinematics of a
prototypical core region at the onset of stellar birth.
  Aims: This paper aims to determine the density, temperature, and velocity
structure of the star-forming Bok globule CB 17. This isolated region is known
to host (at least) two sources at different evolutionary stages: a dense core,
SMM1, and a Class I protostar, IRS.
  Methods: We modeled the cold dust emission maps from 100 micron to 1.2 mm
with both a modified blackbody technique to determine the optical
depth-weighted line-of-sight temperature and column density and a ray-tracing
technique to determine the core temperature and volume density structure.
Furthermore, we analysed the kinematics of CB17 using the high-density gas
tracer N2H+.
  Results: From the ray-tracing analysis, we find a temperature in the centre
of SMM1 of 10.6 K, a flat density profile with radius 9500 au, and a central
volume density of n(H) = 2.3x10^5 cm-3. The velocity structure of the N2H+
observations reveal global rotation with a velocity gradient of 4.3 km/s/pc.
Superposed on this rotation signature we find a more complex velocity field,
which may be indicative of differential motions within the dense core.
  Conclusions: SMM is a core in an early evolutionary stage at the verge of
being bound, but the question of whether it is a starless or a protostellar
core remains unanswered.

that the moment problem, associated with the sum obtained, can be already
solved by the method of Prony and Sylvester. This approach enables us to obtain
interpolation formulas with $n$ nodes $\lambda_k z$, being exact for the
polynomials of degree $\le 2n-1$, whilst traditional formulas with the same

dynamics, arguing that it encodes important information about the behavior of
nonequilibrium systems. In particular we generalize an orthonormality relation
between decay eigenmodes of detailed balanced systems to normal generators that
commute with their time-reversal. Viewing such modes as tangent vectors to the
manifold of statistical distributions, we relate the result to the choice of a
coordinate patch that makes the Fisher-Rao metric Euclidean at the steady
distribution, realizing a sort of statistical equivalence principle. We then
classify nonequilibrium systems according to their spectrum, showing that a
degenerate Fisher matrix is the signature of the insurgence of a class of
dynamical phase transitions between nonequilibrium regimes, characterized by
level crossing and power-law decay in time of suitable order parameters. An
important consequence is that normal systems cannot manifest critical behavior.
Finally, we study the Fisher matrix of systems with time-scale separation.

  Engineering",,,,"cs.SE cs.HC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  User eXperience (UX) is becoming increasingly important for success of
software products. Yet, many companies still face various challenges in their
work with UX. Part of these challenges relate to inadequate knowledge and
awareness of UX and that current UX models are commonly not practical nor well
integrated into existing Software Engineering (SE) models and concepts.
Therefore, we present a conceptual UX-aware model of requirements for software
development practitioners. This layered model shows the interrelation between
UX and functional and quality requirements. The model is developed based on
current models of UX and software quality characteristics. Through the model we
highlight the main differences between various requirement types in particular
essentially subjective and accidentally subjective quality requirements. We
also present the result of an initial validation of the model through
interviews with 12 practitioners and researchers. Our results show that the
model can raise practitioners' knowledge and awareness of UX in particular in
relation to requirement and testing activities. It can also facilitate
UX-related communication among stakeholders with different backgrounds.

possible extra-mixing which could occur in Red Giant stars due to the
modification of the chemical composition induced by nuclear reactions in the
hydrogen burning zone. Recent studies show however that this mixing is not
sufficient to account for the needed surface abundances. A new prescription for
fingering convection, based on 3D numerical simulations has recently been
proposed (BGS). The resulting mixing coefficient is larger than the ones
previously given in the literature. We compute models using this new

compute Red Giant models and we introduce fingering convection using the BGS

the outer dynamical convective zone, the efficiency of the mixing is not enough
to account for the observations. The fingering mixing coefficient should be
increased by two orders of magnitude for the needed surface abundances to be
reached. We confirm that fingering convection cannot be the mixing process

of dark matter models and of gravity theories. In the standard cold dark matter
(CDM) model, spheroids are formed through mergers in a strongly hierarchical
scenario, and also in the early universe through dynamical friction in clumpy
galaxies. More secularly, pseudo-bulges are formed by the inner vertical
resonance with bars. The high efficiency of bulge formation is in tension with
observations in the local universe of a large amount of bulge-less spiral
galaxies. In the present work, the formation of bulges in very gas-rich
galaxies, as those in the early universe, is studied in the Milgrom's MOdified
Newtonian Dynamics (MOND), through multi-grid simulations of the non-linear
gravity, including the gas dissipation, star formation and feedback.
  Clumpy disks are rapidly formed, as in their Newtonian equivalent systems.
However, the dynamical friction is not as efficient, in the absence of dark
matter halos, and the clumps have no time to coalesce into the center to form
bulges, before they are eroded by stellar feedback and shear forces. Previous
work has established that mergers are less frequent in MOND, and classical
bulges are expected less massive. It is now shown that gas-rich clumpy galaxies
in the early universe do not form bulges.
  Since pseudo-bulges are formed with a similar rate as in the Newtonian
equivalent systems, it can be expected that the contribution of pseudo-bulges
is significantly higher in MOND.

difficult because under a handful of ""reasonable"" conditions, we have the

that if L is distributive, then it must be idempotent. (2) Dubois and Padre in
1980 showed that if L has the excluded middle or the non-contradiction property

pair. Thus it would seem impossible to construct a non-trivial fuzzy subset

in detail, and shows that ""hidden"" in the hypotheses of the three is the

further demonstrated that removing this constraint yields the following

most complete response to this issue: we show that termination for affine
programs over Z is decidable under an assumption holding for almost all affine

the notion of asymptotically non-terminating initial variable values} (ANT, for
short) for linear loop programs over Z. Those values are directly associated to
initial variable values for which the corresponding program does not terminate.
We reduce the termination problem of linear affine programs over the integers
to the emptiness check of a specific ANT set of initial variable values. For
this class of linear or affine programs, we prove that the corresponding ANT
set is a semi-linear space and we provide a powerful computational methods
allowing the automatic generation of these $ANT$ sets. Moreover, we are able to
address the conditional termination problem too. In other words, by taking ANT
set complements, we obtain a precise under-approximation of the set of inputs

dynamics of strongly excited fermion systems. Our approach is based on
time-dependent density functional theory at the level of the local density
approximation. This mean-field picture is augmented by collisional correlations
handled in relaxation time approximation which is inspired from the
corresponding semi-classical picture. The method involves the estimate of
microscopic relaxation rates/times which is presently taken from the well
established semi-classical experience. The relaxation time approximation
implies evaluation of the instantaneous equilibrium state towards which the
dynamical state is progressively driven at the pace of the microscopic
relaxation time.
  As test case, we consider Na clusters of various sizes excited either by a
swift ion projectile or by a short and intense laser pulse, driven in various
dynamical regimes ranging from linear to strongly non-linear reactions. We
observe a strong effect of dissipation on sensitive observables such as net
ionization and angular distributions of emitted electrons. The effect is
especially large for moderate excitations where typical relaxation/dissipation
time scales efficiently compete with ionization for dissipating the available
excitation energy. Technical details on the actual procedure to implement a
working recipe of such a quantum relaxation approximation are given in
appendices for completeness.

motion-induced degradation of the quantum Fisher information. We show that
coherent states are generally more resilient to this degradation and that in
the case of very low initial number of photons, the optimal precision can be
even increased by motion. These results can be tested with current technology

results in the limit $n\to\infty$.
  The main aim of the paper is to study the convergence of the evolution of the

transport plan is slip-plane-confined.
  Since the focus is on interaction between dislocations, we renormalize the
elastic energy to remove the potentially large self- or core energy. We prove
Gamma-convergence of this renormalized energy, and we construct joint recovery
sequences for which both the energies and the modified distances converge. With
this augmented Gamma-convergence we prove the convergence of the quasi-static

  July 21st 2014",,,,"q-bio.CB q-bio.PE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Bacterial resistance to antibiotic treatment is a huge concern: introduction
of any new antibiotic is shortly followed by the emergence of resistant
bacterial isolates in the clinic. This issue is compounded by a severe lack of
new antibiotics reaching the market. The significant rise in clinical
resistance to antibiotics is especially problematic in nosocomial infections,
where already vulnerable patients may fail to respond to treatment, causing
even greater health concern. A recent focus has been on the development of
anti-virulence drugs as a second line of defence in the treatment of
antibiotic-resistant infections. This treatment, which weakens bacteria by
reducing their virulence rather than killing them, should allow infections to
be cleared through the body's natural defence mechanisms. In this way there
should be little to no selective pressure exerted on the organism and, as such,
a predominantly resistant population would be unlikely to emerge. However, much
controversy surrounds this approach with many believing it would not be
powerful enough to clear existing infections, restricting its potential
application to prophylaxis. We have developed a mathematical model that
provides a theoretical framework to reveal the circumstances under which
anti-virulence drugs may or may not be successful. We demonstrate that by
harnessing and combining the advantages of antibiotics with those provided by
anti-virulence drugs, given infection-specific parameters, it is possible to
identify treatment strategies that would efficiently clear bacterial
infections, while preventing the emergence of resistant subpopulations. Our
findings strongly support the continuation of research into anti-virulence
drugs and demonstrate that their applicability may reach beyond infection
prevention.

accretion bursts that occur in protoplanetary discs which contain dead zones.
Using 1D viscous disc models we show that diffusive radial transport of heat is
important during the gravo-magnetic limit cycle, and can strongly modify the
duration and frequency of accretion outbursts. When the Prandtl number is large
- such that turbulent diffusion of heat is unimportant - radial radiative
diffusion reduces the burst duration compared to models with no diffusive
transport of heat. When the Prandtl number is small ($\lesssim 25$) we find
that turbulent diffusion dominates the radial transport of heat, reducing the
burst duration to $\lesssim 10^3$ years as well as increasing the burst
frequency. Furthermore, inclusion of radial transport of heat extends the range
of infall rates under which the disc undergoes accretion bursts from $10^{-8}$
to $10^{-6}$ M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ with no diffusion, to $10^{-8}$ to
$\gtrsim10^{-4}$ M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ with radiative and strong turbulent
diffusion. The relative roles of radiative and turbulent thermal diffusion are
likely to vary during an accretion burst, but simple estimates suggest that the
expected Prandtl numbers are of the order of 10 in protoplanetary discs, and
hence that turbulent diffusion is likely to be an important process during
accretion outbursts due to the gravo-magnetic limit cycle.

solid volume fraction are taken as functions of the dimensionless viscous
number I defined as the ratio between the fluid shear stress and the particle
normal stress. We clarify the contributions of the contact and hydrodynamic
interactions on the evolution of the friction coefficient between the dilute
and dense regimes reducing the phenomenological constitutive description to
three physical parameters. We also propose an extension of this constitutive
law from the flowing regime to the fully jammed state. We obtain an analytical
solution of the fully-developed flow in channel and pipe for the frictional
suspension rheology. The result can be transposed to dry granular flow upon
appropriate redefinition of the dimensionless number I. The predictions are in
excellent agreement with available experimental results, when using the values
of the constitutive parameters obtained independently from stress-controlled
rheological measurements. In particular, the frictional rheology correctly
predicts the transition from Poiseuille to plug flow and the associated
particles migration with the increase of the entrance solid volume fraction. We
numerically solve for the axial development of the flow from the inlet of the
channel/pipe toward the fully-developed state. The available experimental data

Brunt-V\""ais\""al\""a to the inertial wave frequency, N/f, is taken to be equal
to 4.95, a choice appropriate to model the dynamics of the southern abyssal
ocean at mid latitudes. This gives a global buoyancy Reynolds number
R_B=ReFr^2=32, a value sufficient for some isotropy to be recovered in the
small scales beyond the Ozmidov scale, but still moderate enough that the
intermediate scales where waves are prevalent are well resolved. We concentrate
on the large-scale dynamics, for which we find a spectrum compatible with the
Bolgiano-Obukhov scaling, and confirm that the Froude number based on a typical
vertical length scale is of order unity, with strong gradients in the vertical.
Two characteristic scales emerge from this computation, and are identified from
sharp variations in the spectral distribution of either total energy or
helicity. A spectral break is also observed at a scale at which the partition
of energy between the kinetic and potential modes changes abruptly, and beyond
which a Kolmogorov-like spectrum recovers. Large slanted layers are ubiquitous
in the flow in the velocity and temperature fields, with local overturning
events indicated by small Richardson numbers, and a small large-scale
enhancement of energy directly attributable to the effect of rotation is also

$\Gamma^D$ is found to be 399(3) s$^{-1}$ for $a_{nn}$=-18.95 and -16.0 fm; and
400(3) s$^{-1}$ for $a_{nn}$=-22.0 fm. For $a_{nn}$=+18.22 fm, we obtain 275(3)
s$^{-1}$ (135(3) s$^{-1}$), when the final $nn$ system is unbound (bound). The
rate $\Gamma_0$ is found to be 1494(15), 1491(16), 1488(18), and 1475(16)
s$^{-1}$ for $a_{nn}$=-18.95, -16.0, -22.0, and +18.22 fm, respectively. The
theoretical uncertainties are due to the fitting procedure and radiative
corrections. Our results seem to exclude the possibility of constraining a
negative $a_{nn}$ with an uncertainty of less than $\sim \pm$ 3 fm through an
accurate determination of the muon capture rates, but the uncertainty on the
present empirical value will not complicate the interpretation of the
(forth-coming) experimental results for $\Gamma^D$. Finally, a comparison with
the already available experimental data discourages the possibility of a bound
$nn$ state.

ends of the tube are dissimilar and are designated as `plus' and `minus' ends.
Motivated by the collective push and pull exerted by a bundle of MTs during
chromosome segregation in a living cell, we have developed here a much
simplified theoretical model of a bundle of parallel dynamic MTs. The plus-end
of all the MTs in the bundle are permanently attached to a movable `wall' by a
device whose detailed structure is not treated explicitly in our model. The
only requirement is that the device allows polymerization and depolymerization
of each MT at the plus-end. In spite of the absence of external force and
direct lateral interactions between the MTs, the group of polymerizing MTs
attached to the wall create a load force against the group of depolymerizing
MTs and vice-versa; the load against a group is shared equally by the members
of that group. Such indirect interactions among the MTs gives rise to the rich
variety of possible states of collective dynamics that we have identified by
computer simulations of the model in different parameter regimes. The
bi-directional motion of the cargo, caused by the load-dependence of the
polymerization kinetics, is a ""proof-of-principle"" that the bi-directional
motion of chromosomes before cell division does not necessarily need active
participation of motor proteins.

particular importance in signal processing, statistics and machine learning.
Although the problem has been stated a few decades ago and solved using
classical (considered nowadays) methods, recently it has attracted more
attention in the context of sparse modeling, where several notable
contributions have been made. In the present manuscript, a new approach is
considered in the framework of greedy algorithms. The noise is split into two
components: a) the inlier bounded noise and b) the outliers, which are
explicitly modeled by employing sparsity arguments. Based on this scheme, a
novel efficient algorithm (Greedy Algorithm for Robust Denoising - GARD), is
derived. GARD alternates between a least square optimization criterion and an
Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP) selection step that identifies the outliers.
The case where only outliers are present has been studied separately, where
bounds on the \textit{Restricted Isometry Property} guarantee that the recovery
of the signal via GARD is exact. Moreover, theoretical results concerning
convergence as well as the derivation of error bounds in the case of additional
bounded noise are discussed. Finally, we provide extensive simulations, which

theoretically studied using both analytical and numerical methods. This spin
system is mapped onto a hard-core boson system, which is composed of
bond-operators describing the triplon excitation. By the analytical method
using the mean-field theory on the bond-operators, we show that cusp
singularities emerge in the magnetization curve as a function of a magnetic
field due to the strong frustration. This originates from a change of number of
Fermi points in the bosonic dispersion relation with the applied field. It is
analogous to Lifshitz transition. This singularity is clarified by numerical
calculation with the density-matrix renormalization-group method. Our results
will be useful to understand the magnetization process observed in the
frustrated two-leg spin-ladder compound BiCu2PO6.

  Substantial revisions after reviewer's comments",,"10.1093/mnras/stu2546",,"astro-ph.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Massive neutrinos are expected to influence the formation of the large-scale
structure of the Universe, depending on the value of their total mass, $\Sigma
m_\nu$. In particular Planck data indicate that a non-zero $\Sigma m_\nu$ may
help to reconcile CMB data with Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) cluster surveys. In
order to study the impact of neutrinos on the SZ and X-ray cluster properties
we run a set of six very large cosmological simulations (8$h^{-3}$ Gpc$^3$
comoving volume) that include a massive neutrino particle component: we
consider the values of $\Sigma m_\nu$ = (0, 0.17, 0.34) eV in two cosmological
scenarios to test possible degeneracies. Using the halo catalogues extracted
from their outputs we produce 50 mock light-cones and, assuming suitable
scaling relations, we determine how massive neutrinos affect SZ and X-ray
cluster counts, the $y$-parameter and its power spectrum. We provide forecasts
for the South Pole Telescope (SPT) and eROSITA cluster surveys, showing that
the number of expected detections is reduced by 40 per cent when assuming
$\Sigma m_\nu$ =0.34 eV with respect to a model with massless neutrinos.
However the degeneracy with $\sigma_8$ and $\Omega_m$ is strong, in particular
for X-ray data, requiring the use of additional probes to break it. The
$y$-parameter properties are also highly influenced by the neutrino mass
fraction, $f_\nu$, with $<\,y\,>\propto(1-f_\nu)^{20}$, considering the cluster
component only, and the normalization of the SZ power spectrum is proportional
to $(1-f_\nu)^{25-30}$. Comparing our findings with SPT and Atacama Cosmology
Telescope measurements at $\ell$ = 3000 indicates that, when Planck
cosmological parameters are assumed, a value of $\Sigma m_\nu\simeq0.34$ eV is
required to fit with the data.

These optical high-state datasets are used to study the flux and spectral
variability of V751 Cyg. Results: Both the XMM-Newton and Swift data show
evidence for modulation of the X-rays for the first time at the known 3.467 hr
orbital period of V751 Cyg. In two Swift observations, taken ten days apart,
the mean X-ray flux remained unchanged, while the UV source brightened by half
a magnitude. The X-ray spectrum was not super-soft during the optical high
state, but rather due to multi-temperature optically thin emission, with
significant (10^{21-22} cm^-2) absorption, which was higher in the observation
by Swift than that of XMM-Newton. The X-ray flux is harder at orbital minimum,
suggesting that the modulation is related to absorption, perhaps linked to the
azimuthally asymmetric wind absorption seen previously in H-alpha.

reactions, apart from its relevance in astrochemistry. The considered collision
energy ranges from the ultracold regime, where only one partial wave is open,
up to the Langevin regime, where many of them contribute. At very low kinetic
energies, both an accurate description of the long-range (LR) region in the
potential energy surface (PES), and long dynamical propagations, up to
distances of 10$^{5}$ a0, are required. Accordingly, calculations have been
carried out on the PES by Velilla et al. [J. Chem. Phys. 2008, 129,084307]
which accurately reproduces the LR interactions. Hyperspherical methodology was
recently modified in order to allow the accurate inclusion of LR interactions
while minimizing the computational expense. Such implementation is shown
particularly suitable for systems involving ions, where the $R^{-4}$ behavior
largely extends the range of the potential. We find a reaction rate coefficient
which remains almost constant in a kinetic energy range of more than ten orders
of magnitude. In particular, the value reached in the Wigner regime, where only
one partial wave is open, is paradoxically the Langevin classical value (within
a few percent) expected at high energies. Results are discussed in terms of
{\em universality} and related to the recently published quantum defect theory
[Phys. Rev. Lett. 2013, 110, 213202]. Since the system has small exothermicity

originating from the periodic self-assembly of helical 300 nm long
tropocollagen complexes. The fibril radius is typically between 25 to 250 nm,
and tropocollagen at the surface appears to exhibit a characteristic
twist-angle with respect to the fibril axis. Similar fibril radii and
twist-angles at the surface are observed in vitro, suggesting that these
features are controlled by a similar self-assembly process. In this work, we
propose a physical mechanism of equilibrium radius control for collagen fibrils
based on a radially varying double-twist alignment of tropocollagen within a
collagen fibril. The free-energy of alignment is similar to that of liquid
crystalline blue phases, and we employ an analytic Euler-Lagrange and numerical
free energy minimization to determine the twist-angle between the molecular
axis and the fibril axis along the radial direction. Competition between the
different elastic energy components, together with a surface energy, determines
the equilibrium radius and twist-angle at the fibril surface. A simplified
model with a twist-angle that is linear with radius is a reasonable
approximation in some parameter regimes, and explains a power-law dependence of
radius and twist-angle at the surface as parameters are varied. Fibril radius
and twist-angle at the surface corresponding to an equilibrium free-energy
minimum are consistent with existing experimental measurements of collagen
fibrils. Remarkably, in the experimental regime, all of our model parameters
are important for controlling equilibrium structural parameters of collagen
fibrils.

approximation is derived and used to partition the reactions into fast and slow
sets, where the fast set is simulated by a stochastic differential equation and
the slow set is modeled by a discrete chain. The error bound leads to a very
efficient dynamic partitioning algorithm which has been implemented for several
multi-scale reaction systems. The gain in computational efficiency is
illustrated by a realistically sized model of a signal transduction cascade

that capture, e.g., restricted information, visibility, or externalities in
markets. Each agent is a node in a fixed matching network and strives to be
matched to another agent. Each agent has a complete preference list over all
other agents it can be matched with. However, depending on the constraints and
the current state of the game, not all possible partners are available for
matching at all times. For correlated preferences, we propose and study a
general class of hedonic coalition formation games that we call coalition
formation games with constraints. This class includes and extends many recently
studied variants of stable matching, such as locally stable matching, socially
stable matching, or friendship matching. Perhaps surprisingly, we show that all
these variants are encompassed in a class of ""consistent"" instances that always
allow a polynomial improvement sequence to a stable state. In addition, we show
that for consistent instances there always exists a polynomial sequence to
every reachable state. Our characterization is tight in the sense that we
provide exponential lower bounds when each of the requirements for consistency
is violated. We also analyze matching with uncorrelated preferences, where we
obtain a larger variety of results. While socially stable matching always
allows a polynomial sequence to a stable state, for other classes different
additional assumptions are sufficient to guarantee the same results. For the
problem of reaching a given stable state, we show NP-hardness in almost all
considered classes of matching games.

proposed equations of state of matter at and above nuclear density. One
sub-class of neutron stars - those inside quiescent low-mass X-ray binaries
(qLMXBs) - produce a thermal surface emission from which the neutron star
radius (R_NS) can be measured, using the widely accepted observational scenario
for qLMXBs, assuming unmagnetized H atmospheres. In a combined spectral
analysis, this work first reproduces a previously published measurement of the
\rns, assumed to be the same for all neutron stars, using a slightly expanded
data set. The radius measured is R_NS = 9.4 +/-1.2 km. On the basis of spectral
analysis alone, this measured value is not affected by imposing an assumption
of causality in the core. However, the assumptions underlying this R_NS
measurement would be falsified by the observation of any neutron star with a
mass >2.6 Msun, since radii <11 km would be rejected if causality is assumed,
which would exclude most of the R_NS parameter space obtained in this analysis.
Finally, this work directly tests a selection of dense matter equations of
states: WFF1, AP4, MPA1, PAL1, MS0, and three versions of equations of state
produced through chiral effective theory. Two of those, MSO and PAL1, are
rejected at the 99% confidence level, accounting for all quantifiable
uncertainties, while the other cannot be excluded at >99% certainty.

Efficient use of highly diluted apertures for coherent imaging can be done with
pupil densification, a technique also called 'hypertelescope imaging'. Although
best done with adaptive phasing, concentrating most energy in a dominant
interference peak for a rich direct image of a complex source, such imaging is
also possible with random phase errors such as caused by turbulent 'seeing',
using methods such as speckle imaging which uses several short exposure images
to reconstruct the true image. We have simulated such observations using an
aperture which changes through the night, as naturally happens on Earth with
fixed grounded mirror elements, and find that reconstructed images of star

were infected with HIV. Malawi is a low-income country and the cost of putting
all HIV-positive people in Malawi onto ART, expressed as a percentage of the
gross domestic product, is the highest in the world. Nevertheless, Malawi has
made great progress and the greatly reduced cost of potent anti-retroviral
therapy (ART) makes it possible to contemplate ending the epidemic of HIV/AIDS.
Here we consider what would have happened without ART, the No ART
counterfactual, the impact if the current level of roll-out of ART is
maintained, the Current Programme, and the likely impact if treatment is made
available to everyone who is eligible under the 2013 guidelines of the World
Health Organization reaching full coverage by 2020, the Expanded Programme.
  The Current Programme has substantially reduced the epidemic of HIV and the
number of people dying of AIDS. The Expanded Programme has the potential to
avert more infections, save more lives and end the epidemic. The annual cost of
managing HIV will increase from about US$132 million in 2014 to about US$155
million in 2020 but will fall after that. If the Expanded Programme is
implemented several key areas must be addressed. Testing services will need to
be expanded and supported by mass testing campaigns, so as to diagnose people
with HIV and enrol them in treatment and care as early as possible. A regular
and uninterrupted supply of drugs will have to be assured. The quantity and
quality of existing health staff will need to be strengthened. Community health
workers will need to be mobilized and trained to encourage people to be tested
and accept treatment, to monitor progress and to support people on treatment;
this in turn will help to reduce stigma and discrimination, loss to follow up
of people diagnosed with HIV, and improve adherence for those on treatment.

distributed transmit antennas, where there is no inter-range-cell interference
(IRCI). It can collect full spatial diversity and each transmitter transmits
signals with the same frequency band, i.e., the range resolution is not
reduced. However, it needs to transmit multiple OFDM pulses consecutively to
obtain range profiles for a single swath, which may be too long in time for a
reasonable swath width. In this letter, we propose a CP based MIMO-OFDM
synthetic aperture radar (SAR) system, where each transmitter transmits only a
single OFDM pulse to obtain range profiles for a swath and has the same
frequency band, thus the range resolution is not reduced. It is IRCI free and
can collect the full spatial diversity if the transmit antennas are
distributed. Our main idea is to use circularly shifted Zadoff-Chu sequences as
the weighting coefficients in the OFDM pulses for different transmit antennas
and apply spatial filters with multiple receive antennas to divide the whole
swath into multiple subswaths, and then each subswath is reconstructed/imaged
using our proposed IRCI free range reconstruction method.
