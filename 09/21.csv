Sunyaev and Shakura for the description of the disk in the propeller stage and
find the inner radius of the disk to be inside the light cylinder radius. We
perform a high resolution X-ray analysis with XMM-Newton and find a narrow
absorption feature at 0.57 keV which can be interpreted as K$_{\alpha}$ line of
He-like oxygen (OVII). The strength of the line indicates an element
over-abundance in our line of sight exceeding the amounts that would be
expected from ISM. The spectral feature may originate from the pulsar wind
nebula and may be partly caused by the reprocessed X-ray radiation by the
fallback disk. We discuss the lower-than-3 braking index of Vela as partially
due to the contribution of the propeller torques. Our results suggest that the
pulsar mechanism can work simultaneously with the propeller processes and that
the debris disks can survive the radiation pressure for at least $\sim 10^4$
years. As Vela is a relatively close object, and a prototypical pulsar, the
presence of a disk, if confirmed, may indicate the ubiquity of debris disks
around young neutron stars.

  Our analysis based on galaxy groups confirmed the results obtained at larger
mass scales: strong lenses present apparently too large concentrations, which
can be explained by triaxial haloes preferentially oriented with the line of
sight. Because more massive systems already have large lensing cross sections,
they do not require a large elongation along the line of sight, contrary to
less massive galaxy groups. Therefore, it is natural to observe larger lensing
(projected) concentrations for such systems, resulting in an overall
mass-concentration relation steeper than that of non-lensing haloes.

disaggregate a household's electricity consumption into constituent appliances.
More than three decades of work in NILM has resulted in the development of
several novel algorithmic approaches. However, despite these advancements, two
core challenges still exist: i) disaggregating low power consumption appliances
and ii) distinguishing between multiple instances of similar appliances. These
challenges are becoming increasingly important due to an increasing number of
appliances and increased usage of electronics in homes. Previous approaches
have attempted to solve these problems using expensive hardware involving high
sampling rates better suited to laboratory settings, or using additional number
of sensors, limiting the ease of deployment. In this work, we explore using
commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) power line communication (PLC) modems as an
inexpensive and easy to deploy alternative solution to these problems. We use
the reduction in bandwidth between two PLC modems, caused due to the change in
PLC modulation scheme when different appliances are operated as a signature for
an appliance. Since the noise generated in the powerline is dependent both on
type and location of an appliance, we believe that our technique based on PLC
modems can be a promising addition for solving NILM.

to the ambient radiation field and the heating of dust grains. In order to
characterize dust properties in galaxies over a wide range of physical
conditions, we present here the radial surface brightness profiles of the
entire sample of 61 galaxies from Key Insights into Nearby Galaxies:
Far-Infrared Survey with Herschel (KINGFISH). The main goal of our work is the
characterization of the grain emissivities, dust temperatures, and interstellar
radiation fields responsible for heating the dust. After fitting the dust and
stellar radial profiles with exponential functions, we fit the far-infrared
spectral energy distribution (SED) in each annular region with
single-temperature modified black bodies using both variable (MBBV) and fixed
(MBBF) emissivity indices beta, as well as with physically motivated dust
models. Results show that while most SED parameters decrease with radius, the
emissivity index beta also decreases with radius in some galaxies, but in
others is increasing, or rising in the inner regions and falling in the outer
ones. Despite the fixed grain emissivity (average beta~ 2.1) of the
physically-motivated models, they are well able to accommodate flat spectral
slopes with beta<= 1. We find that flatter slopes (beta<= 1.5) are associated
with cooler temperatures, contrary to what would be expected from the usual
Tdust-beta degeneracy. This trend is related to variations in Umin since beta
and Umin are very closely linked over the entire range in Umin sampled by the
KINGFISH galaxies: low Umin is associated with flat beta<=1. Both these results
strongly suggest that the low apparent \beta values (flat slopes) in MBBV fits
are caused by temperature mixing along the line-of-sight, rather than by
intrinsic variations in grain properties. Abstract truncated for arXiv.

the density of special sets in infinite grids. However, the minimum density of
an identifying code in the hexagonal grid remains open, with an upper bound of
$\frac{3}{7} \approx 0.428571$ and a lower bound of $\frac{5}{12}\approx
0.416666$. We present a new, experimental framework for producing discharging
arguments using an algorithm. This algorithm replaces the lengthy case analysis
of human-written discharging arguments with a linear program that produces the
best possible lower bound using the specified set of discharging rules. We use
this framework to present a lower bound of $\frac{23}{55} \approx 0.418181$ on
the density of an identifying code in the hexagonal grid, and also find several
sharp lower bounds for variations on identifying codes in the hexagonal,

  phenomenon as a concrete illustration of our results",,,,"math.PR math.ST stat.TH","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Schools with the highest average student performance are often the smallest
schools; localities with the highest rates of some cancers are frequently small
and the effects observed in clinical trials are likely to be largest for the
smallest numbers of subjects. Informal explanations of this ""small-schools
phenomenon"" point to the fact that the sample means of smaller samples have
higher variances. But this cannot be a complete explanation: If we draw two
samples from a diffuse distribution that is symmetric about some point, then
the chance that the smaller sample has larger mean is 50\%. A particular
consequence of results proved below is that if one draws three or more samples
of different sizes from the same normal distribution, then the sample mean of
the smallest sample is most likely to be highest, the sample mean of the second
smallest sample is second most likely to be highest, and so on; this is true
even though for any pair of samples, each one of the pair is equally likely to
have the larger sample mean.
  Our conclusions are relevant to certain stochastic choice models including
the following generalization of Thurstone's Law of Comparative Judgment. There
are $n$ items. Item $i$ is preferred to item $j$ if $Z_i < Z_j$, where $Z$ is a
random $n$-vector of preference scores. Suppose $\mathbb{P}\{Z_i = Z_j\} = 0$
for $i \ne j$, so there are no ties. Item $k$ is the favorite if $Z_k <
\min_{i\ne k} Z_i$. Let $p_i$ denote the chance that item $i$ is the favorite.
We characterize a large class of distributions for $Z$ for which $p_1 > p_2 >
\cdots > p_n$. Our results are most surprising when $\mathbb{P}\{Z_i < Z_j\} =
\mathbb{P}\{Z_i > Z_j\} = \frac{1}{2}$ for $i \ne j$, so neither of any two
items is likely to be preferred over the other in a pairwise comparison.

models to solve the gauge hierarchy problem of scales by using a
compactification scale of the same order of the fundamental Planck scale,
completely eliminating the hierarchy between the electroweak and the Planck
scales. However, most of the so far studied families of braneworlds with
super-exponential warp factors do not localize 4D gravity when one of the
branes is sent to infinity. Recently a braneworld model generated by a
canonical scalar field $\phi$ minimally coupled to 5D gravity with a bulk
cosmological constant was shown to localize 4D gravity and to be stable under
linear tensorial and scalar perturbations. Here we present an explicit new
solution for the latter braneworld configuration and study the dynamics of its
tensorial perturbations: we find that they obey a Schr\""odinger-like equation
with a well potential which possesses exponentially increasing walls (we call
it the {\it cup potential}), yielding a {\it novel discrete spectrum} for the
massive Kaluza-Klein (KK) tensorial excitations, despite the non-compact nature
of the fifth dimension, and in contrast to the braneworld models proposed so
far, where the mass spectrum of the KK modes is continuous, or at most mixed.
Finally, the corrections to Newton's law coming from these massive KK modes are
computed. Their novelty arises from the fact that these {\it KK excitations
possess quantized masses and are bound to the brane}, however, they are all of
the Planck mass order, leading to unreachable energy scales from the
phenomenological viewpoint.

  It is shown that 40 minutes before meteor fall the EKB radar started to
observe powerful scattering from irregularities elongated with the Earth
magnetic field in the F-layer. Scattering was observed for 80 minutes and
stopped 40 minutes after the meteorite fall.
  During 9-15 minutes after the meteorite fall at ranges 400-1200 km from the
explosion site a changes were observed in the spectral and amplitude
characteristics of the scattered signal. This features were the sharp increase
in the Doppler frequency shift of the scattered signal corresponding to the
Doppler velocities about 600 m/s and the sharp increase of the scattered signal
amplitude. This allows us to conclude that we detected the growth of
small-scale ionospheric irregularities elongated with the Earth magnetic field
at E-layer heights. Joint analysis with the seismic data and numerical modeling
shows that the observed effect is connected with the passage of secondary
acoustic front formed by supersonic seismic ground wave from the 'Chelyabinsk'

  As a possible explanation the growth of elongated ionospheric irregularities
may be caused by the passage of the high-speed acoustic wave in the ionosphere
in the presence of high enough background electric field.

(MB) strategy. The MB strategy employs successive interference cancellation
(SIC) on several parallel branches which are equipped with different ordering
patterns so that each branch produces transmit signals by exploiting a certain
ordering pattern. For each parallel branch, the proposed robust nonlinear
transceiver design consists of THP at the source along with a linear precoder
at the relay and a linear minimum-mean-squared-error (MMSE) receiver at the
destination. By taking the channel uncertainties into account, the source and
relay precoders are jointly optimised to minimise the mean-squared-error (MSE).
We then employ a diagonalization method along with some attributes of
matrix-monotone functions to convert the optimization problem with matrix
variables into an optimization problem with scalar variables. We resort to an
iterative method to obtain the solution for the relay and the source precoders
via Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions. An appropriate selection rule is
developed to choose the nonlinear transceiver corresponding to the best branch
for data transmission. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed MB-THP
scheme is capable of alleviating the effects of channel state information (CSI)
errors and improving the robustness of the system.

the portfolio is built using noisy data, the expected value of the signal-noise
ratio is bounded from above via a Cramer-Rao bound, for the case of Gaussian
returns. The bound holds for `biased' estimators, thus there appears to be no
bias-variance tradeoff for the problem of maximizing the signal-noise ratio. An
approximate distribution of the signal-noise ratio for the Markowitz portfolio
is given, and shown to be fairly accurate via Monte Carlo simulations, for
Gaussian returns as well as more exotic returns distributions. These findings
imply that if the maximal population signal-noise ratio grows slower than the
universe size to the 1/4 power, there may be no diversification benefit, rather
expected signal-noise ratio can decrease with additional assets. As a practical
matter, this may explain why the Markowitz portfolio is typically applied to
small asset universes. Finally, the theorem is expanded to cover more general

functions when a host in a communication network is subject to an attack. Such
security functions include appropriate actions against attackers. To properly
afford active security actions a set of software subsystems should be
integrated together so that they can automatically detect and appropriately
address any vulnerability in the underlying network. This work presents
integrated model for active security response model. The proposed model
introduces Active Response Mechanism (ARM) for tracing anonymous attacks in the
network back to their source. This work is motivated by the increased frequency
and sophistication of denial-of-service attacks and by the difficulty in
tracing packets with incorrect, or ""spoofed"", source addresses. This paper
presents within the proposed model two tracing approaches based on:
  1.Sleepy Watermark Tracing (SWT) for unauthorized access attacks.
  2.Probabilistic Packet Marking (PPM) in the network for Denial of Service
(DoS) and Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks. On the basis of the
proposed model a cooperative network security tools such as firewall, intrusion
detection system with IP tracing mechanism has been designed for taking a rapid
active response against real IPs for attackers. The proposed model is able to
detect network vulnerabilities, trace attack source IP and reconfigure the
attacked subnetworks.

consequences of the design of the system in which they appear. This
characteristic is no less relevant when attempting to simulate such phenomena,
given that the outcome is not always a foregone conclusion. The present survey
focuses on several simple model systems that exhibit surprisingly rich emergent
behavior, all studied by MD simulation. The examples are taken from the
disparate fields of fluid dynamics, granular matter and supramolecular
self-assembly. In studies of fluids modeled at the detailed microscopic level
using discrete particles, the simulations demonstrate that complex hydrodynamic
phenomena in rotating and convecting fluids, the Taylor-Couette and
Rayleigh-B\'enard instabilities, can not only be observed within the limited
length and time scales accessible to MD, but even quantitative agreement can be
achieved. Simulation of highly counterintuitive segregation phenomena in
granular mixtures, again using MD methods, but now augmented by forces
producing damping and friction, leads to results that resemble experimentally
observed axial and radial segregation in the case of a rotating cylinder, and
to a novel form of horizontal segregation in a vertically vibrated layer.
Finally, when modeling self-assembly processes analogous to the formation of
the polyhedral shells that package spherical viruses, simulation of suitably
shaped particles reveals the ability to produce complete, error-free assembly,
and leads to the important general observation that reversible growth steps
contribute to the high yield. While there are limitations to the MD approach,
both computational and conceptual, the results offer a tantalizing hint of the
kinds of phenomena that can be explored, and what might be discovered when
sufficient resources are brought to bear on a problem.

P3HT:PCBM blends exposed to concentrated sunlight in the presence of traces of
oxygen/ humidity showed degradation induced by photo-oxidation of the P3HT
backbone within the P3HT:PCBM blend, which is significantly thermally
accelerated, in agreement with previous observations. However, this could be
demonstrated in a time scale of minutes and hours, i.e., significantly
accelerated. Exposure of well encapsulated P3HT:PCBM films to concentrated

perception of the process is that, due to declining communication and transport
costs, distance becomes less and less important. However, the distance
coefficient in the gravity model of trade, which grows in time, indicates that
the role of distance increases rather than decreases. This, in essence,
captures the notion of the globalization puzzle. Here, we show that the
fractality of the international trade system (ITS) provides a simple solution
for the puzzle. We argue, that the distance coefficient corresponds to the
fractal dimension of ITS. We provide two independent methods, box counting
method and spatial choice model, which confirm this statement. Our results
allow us to conclude that the previous approaches to solving the puzzle
misinterpreted the meaning of the distance coefficient in the gravity model of
trade.

exceeding n can be expressed as the sum of no more than h values a_i; we write
n = n_h(A_k). An extremal h-basis A_k is one for which n is as large as
possible, and then we write n = n_h(k).
  The ""local"" Postage Stamp Problem is concerned with properties of particular
sets A_k, and it is clear that sets where n_h(A_k) does not exceed a_k are of
little interest. We define h_0(k) to be the smallest value of h for which
n_h(A_k) exceeds a_k; such sets are called ""admissible"".
  We say that a value n can be ""generated"" by A_k if it can be expressed as the
sum of no more than h values a_i, or - equivalently - if it can be expressed as
the sum of exactly h values a_i from the set A'_k = {0, a_1, a_2, ... a_k}. No
values greater than ha_k can be generated, and we now consider the number of
values less than ha_k that have no generation, denoted m_h(A_k) - essentially a
count of the number of ""gaps"" (see Challis [1], and Selmer [5] page 3.1).
  It is easy to show that for some value h_2(k) exceeding h_0(k) the difference
m_h(A_k) - m_(h+1)(A_k) remains constant - that is, the ""pattern"" of missing
values between ha_k and (h+1)a_k does not change as h increases. Here we are
interested in the pattern of missing values for values that lie between h_0 and
h_2.
  On page 7.8 of Selmer [5] he conjectures that the sequence of differences
m_h(A_k) - m_(h+1)(A_k) is non-increasing as h runs from h_0 to h_2. When I
came across this conjecture I could not convince myself that it was likely to
be true, having found a possible error in Selmer's justification. I wrote to
him in November 1995, and early in 1996 he replied, agreeing that this might be
the case and hoping that I might be able to find a counter example. This paper
records my successful search for a counter example, eventually found late in
1999.

  The function $L(\vec{x})$ has been studied extensively in the literature, and

relations in terms of Coxeter group actions on $\vec{x}$, and have developed a
similar theory of two-term and three-term relations for $K(\vec{x})$.
  In this article, we derive ""mixed"" three-term relations, wherein any one of

  We further classify the eighteen orbits into five types, with each type
uniquely determined by the distances (under a certain natural metric) between

delay selection is one of the most vital criteria. This is normally done by
using a general measure viz., mutual information (MI). However, in that case,
the delay selection is limited to the estimation of a single delay using MI
between two variables only. The corresponding reconstructed phase space is also
not satisfactory. To overcome the situation, a high-dimensional estimator of
the MI is used; it selects more than one delay between more than two variables.
The quality of the reconstructed phase space is tested by shape distortion
parameter (SD), it is found that even this multidimensional MI sometimes fails
to produce a less distorted phase space. In this paper, an alternative
nonlinear measure cross autocorrelation (CAC) is introduced. A comparative
study is made between the reconstructed phase spaces of a known three
dimensional Neuro dynamical model, Lorenz dynamical model and a three
dimensional food web model under MI for two and higher dimensions and also
under cross auto-correlation separately. It is found that the least distorted
phase space is obtained only under the notion of cross autocorrelation.

expressed automatically by an equipartition relation, while the q-parameter is
related to the scaled variance and to the expectation value of the particle
number. For the binomial distribution q is smaller, for the negative binomial q
is larger than one. These results also represent an approximation for general
particle number distributions in the reservoir up to second order in the
canonical expansion. For general systems the average phase-space volume ratio
expanded to second order delivers a q parameter related to the heat capacity
and to the variance of the temperature. However, q differing from one leads to
non-additivity of the Boltzmann-Gibbs entropy. We demonstrate that a deformed
entropy, K(S), can be constructed and used for demanding additivity. This
requirement leads to a second order differential equation for K(S). Finally,
the generalized q-entropy formula contains the Tsallis, Renyi and
Boltzmann-Gibbs-Shannon expressions as particular cases. For diverging

gradient of gravitational/electrostatic $N$-body systems, which we call
particle mesh multipole method (PMMM or PM$^3$). PMMM can be understood both as
an extension of the particle mesh (PM) method and as an optimization of the
fast multipole method (FMM).In the former viewpoint, the scalar density and
potential held by a grid point are extended to multipole moments and local
expansions in $(p+1)^2$ real numbers, where $p$ is the order of expansion. In
the latter viewpoint, a hierarchical octree structure which brings its
$\mathcal O(N)$ nature, is replaced with a uniform mesh structure, and we
exploit the convolution theorem with fast Fourier transform (FFT) to speed up
the calculations. Hence, independent $(p+1)^2$ FFTs with the size equal to the
number of grid points are performed.
  The fundamental idea is common to PPPM/MPE by Shimada et al. (1993) and FFTM
by Ong et al. (2003). PMMM differs from them in supporting both the open and
periodic boundary conditions, and employing an irreducible form where both the
multipole moments and local expansions are expressed in $(p+1)^2$ real numbers
and the transformation matrices in $(2p+1)^2$ real numbers.
  The computational complexity is the larger of $\mathcal O(p^2 N)$ and
$\mathcal O(N \log (N/p^2))$, and the memory demand is $\mathcal O(N)$ when the
number of grid points is $\propto N/p^2$.

presented. By using local approximations, lower degree polynomials become
sufficient, and both local and global properties of the value function are
captured. The domain of the problem is split into a non-overlapping partition,
with added constraints ensuring $C^1$ continuity. The Alternating Direction

improved conditioning of the problem and allows for much larger and more

paper, we study the algorithmic issues on the least-core and nucleolus of

$G=(V,E)$ and a threshold $T$, in which the player set is $V$ and the profit of
a coalition $S\subseteq V$ is 1 if the size of a maximum matching in $G[S]$
meets or exceeds $T$, and 0 otherwise. We first show that for a TCMG, the
problems of computing least-core value, finding and verifying least-core payoff
are all polynomial time solvable. We also provide a general characterization of
the least core for a large class of TCMG. Next, based on Gallai-Edmonds
Decomposition in matching theory, we give a concise formulation of the
nucleolus for a typical case of TCMG which the threshold $T$ equals $1$. When
the threshold $T$ is relevant to the input size, we prove that the nucleolus

of linear dispersion, to the modification of the pulse complex electric field

imprint on the pulse envelope under both gain and absorption conditions. The
inclusion of these effects leads to a better fit with experiments and to a

In particular, it is shown that under certain criteria the optimal navigation
function is related to Laplace's equation, previously used in the literature,

available in simplified domains, yielding guidance towards optimality for
approximation schemes. Examples are used to illustrate the role that noise, and

decades, and currently have a wide range of applications ranging from key
predistribution in wireless sensor networks to modeling social networks. In
this paper, we investigate the strengths of connectivity and robustness in a
general random intersection graph model. Specifically, we establish sharp
asymptotic zero-one laws for $k$-connectivity and $k$-robustness, as well as
the asymptotically exact probability of $k$-connectivity, for any positive
integer $k$. The $k$-connectivity property quantifies how resilient is the
connectivity of a graph against node or edge failures. On the other hand,
$k$-robustness measures the effectiveness of local diffusion strategies (that
do not use global graph topology information) in spreading information over the
graph in the presence of misbehaving nodes. In addition to presenting the
results under the general random intersection graph model, we consider two
special cases of the general model, a binomial random intersection graph and a
uniform random intersection graph, which both have numerous applications as
well. For these two specialized graphs, our results on asymptotically exact
probabilities of $k$-connectivity and asymptotic zero-one laws for
$k$-robustness are also novel in the literature.
