established stream mining methods in the context of solar physics, with a goal
of providing an introductory overview of stream mining algorithms employed by
the computer science fields. We consider key concepts surrounding stream mining
that are applicable to solar physics, outlining existing algorithms developed
to address this problem in other fields of study, and discuss their
applicability to massive solar data sets. We also discuss the considerations
and trade-offs that may need to be made when applying stream mining methods to
solar data. We find that while no one single solution is readily available,
many of the methods now employed in other data streaming applications could
successfully be modified to apply to solar data and prove invaluable for

strong noise and dissipation. Starting from a description in terms of a
Markovian quantum master equation we derive effective equations of motion that
govern the dynamics on a ""coarse-grained"" timescale where fast dissipative
degrees of freedom have been adiabatically eliminated. Specifically, we
consider two scenarios which are of relevance for current theoretical and
experimental studies --- Rydberg atoms in a two-level (spin) approximation
subject to strong dephasing noise as well as Rydberg atoms under so-called
electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) conditions and fast radiative
decay. In the former case we find that the effective dynamics is described by
classical rate equations up to second order in an appropriate perturbative
expansion. This drastically reduces the computational complexity of numerical
simulations in comparison to the full quantum master equation. When accounting
for the fourth order correction in this expansion, however, we find that the
resulting equation breaks the preservation of positivity and thus cannot be
interpreted as a proper classical master rate equation. In the EIT system we
find that the expansion up to second order retains information not only on the
""classical"" observables, but also on some quantum coherences. Nevertheless,
this perturbative treatment still achieves a non-trivial reduction of
complexity with respect to the original problem.

iteratively reweighted $\ell_1$ minimization updates the weight for each
component based on the value of the same component at the previous iteration.
It assigns large weights on small components in magnitude and small weights on
large components in magnitude. In this paper, we consider a weighted $\ell_1$
penalty with the set of the weights fixed and the weights are assigned based on
the sort of all the components in magnitude. The smallest weight is assigned to
the largest component in magnitude. This new penalty is called nonconvex sorted
$\ell_1$. Then we propose two methods for solving nonconvex sorted $\ell_1$
minimization problems: iteratively reweighted $\ell_1$ minimization and
iterative sorted thresholding, and prove that both methods will converge to a
local optimum. We also show that both methods are generalizations of iterative
support detection and iterative hard thresholding respectively. The numerical

$u(x,0)$ that are integrable and decay at infinity. Previous papers have
established the existence of mass-preserving, nonnegative weak solutions

so such measurements are influenced by contributions from multiple surfaces of
varying transport character. Instead, we study magnetotransport of SmB$_6$
using a Corbino geometry, which can directly measure the conductivity of a
single, independent surface. Both (011) and (001) crystal surfaces show a
strong negative magnetoresistance at all magnetic field angles measured. The
(011) surface has a carrier mobility of $122\text{
cm}^2/\text{V}\cdot\text{sec}$ with a carrier density of $2.5\times10^{13}
\text{ cm}^{-2}$, which are significantly smaller than indicated by Hall
transport studies. This mobility value can explain a failure so far to observe
Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations. Analysis of the angle-dependence of
conductivity on the (011) surface suggests a combination of a field-dependent
enhancement of the carrier density and a suppression of Kondo scattering from
native oxide layer magnetic moments as the likely origin of the negative
magnetoresistance. Our results also reveal a hysteretic behavior whose
magnitude depends on the magnetic field sweep rate and temperature. Although
this feature becomes smaller when the field sweep is slower, does not disappear
or saturate during our slowest sweep-rate measurements, which is much slower
than a typical magnetotransport trace. These observations cannot be explained
by quantum interference corrections such as weak anti-localization, but are
more likely due to an extrinsic magnetic effect such as the magnetocaloric
effect or glassy ordering.

powered mainly by the multi-peak 0.1--0.3 GeV emission. The peak fluxes during
both the flares are similar except in the 1--3 GeV band in April which is twice
the corresponding flux during the June flare. Hardness ratios during the April
flare indicate spectral hardening in the rising phase followed by softening
during the decay. We attribute this behavior to the development of a shock
associated with an increase in acceleration efficiency followed by its decay
leading to spectral softening. The June flare suggests hardening during the
rise followed by a complicated energy dependent behavior during the decay.
Observed features during the June flare favor multiple emission regions while
the overall flaring episode can be related to jet dynamics.

dynamically induced collapse of the wave-function during a quantum measurement.
The collapse is mediated by a stochastic non-linear modification of the
Schrodinger equation. A consequence of the CSL mechanism is an extremely tiny
violation of energy-momentum conservation, which can, in principle, be detected
in the laboratory via the random diffusion of a particle induced by the
stochastic collapse mechanism. In a paper in 2003, Collett and Pearle
investigated the translational CSL diffusion of a sphere, and the rotational
CSL diffusion of a disc, and showed that this effect dominates over the ambient
environmental noise at low temperatures and extremely low pressures (about
ten-thousandth of a pico-Torr). In the present paper, we revisit their analysis
and argue that this stringent condition on pressure can be relaxed, and that
the CSL effect can be seen at the pressure of about a pico-Torr. A similar
analysis is provided for diffusion produced by gravity-induced decoherence,
where the effect is typically much weaker than CSL. We also discuss the CSL
induced random displacement of a quantum oscillator. Lastly, we propose
possible experimental set-ups justifying that CSL diffusion is indeed
measurable with the current technology.

applied to a variety of domains, including the text categorization, image

  Typical kernel functions for sequences in these domains (e.g., bag-of-words,

(i.e. one-dimensional) string data, such as sequences of words in the text
analysis, codeword sequences in the image analysis, or nucleotide or amino acid
sequences in the DNA and protein sequence analysis. However, original sequence
data are often of real-valued multivariate nature, i.e. are not univariate and
discrete as required by typical $k$-mer based sequence kernel functions.
  In this work, we consider the problem of the {\em multivariate} sequence
classification such as classification of multivariate music sequences, or
multidimensional protein sequence representations. To this end, we extend {\em
univariate} kernel functions typically used in sequence analysis and propose
efficient {\em multivariate} similarity kernel method (MVDFQ-SK) based on (1) a
direct feature quantization (DFQ) of each sequence dimension in the original
{\em real-valued} multivariate sequences and (2) applying novel multivariate
discrete kernel measures on these multivariate discrete DFQ sequence
representations to more accurately capture similarity relationships among

  Experiments using the proposed MVDFQ-SK kernel method show excellent

protection system which we call the THRIVE system. The system includes novel
enrollment and authentication protocols based on threshold homomorphic
cryptosystem where the private key is shared between a user and the verifier.
In the THRIVE system, only encrypted binary biometric templates are stored in
the database and verification is performed via homomorphically randomized
templates, thus, original templates are never revealed during the
authentication stage. The THRIVE system is designed for the malicious model
where the cheating party may arbitrarily deviate from the protocol
specification. Since threshold homomorphic encryption scheme is used, a
malicious database owner cannot perform decryption on encrypted templates of
the users in the database. Therefore, security of the THRIVE system is enhanced
using a two-factor authentication scheme involving the user's private key and
the biometric data. We prove security and privacy preservation capability of
the proposed system in the simulation-based model with no assumption. The
proposed system is suitable for applications where the user does not want to
reveal her biometrics to the verifier in plain form but she needs to proof her
physical presence by using biometrics. The system can be used with any
biometric modality and biometric feature extraction scheme whose output
templates can be binarized. The overall connection time for the proposed THRIVE
system is estimated to be 336 ms on average for 256-bit biohash vectors on a

mechanisms need consideration. This is because trapped gas (e.g. air) in the
roughness valleys can dissolve into the water pool, leading to invasion.
Additionally, water vapor can also occupy the roughness valleys of immersed
surfaces. If water vapor condenses, that too leads to invasion. These effects
have not been investigated, and are critically important to maintain surfaces
dry under water. In this work, we identify the critical roughness scale below

that we can detect sub-$\mu$K CMB polarization represents a tremendous
technological breakthrough. Yet more information may be latent in the CMB's
polarization pattern. Because of its tensorial nature, CMB polarization may
also reveal parity-violating physics via a detection of cosmic polarization
rotation. Although current CMB polarimeters are sensitive enough to measure one
degree-level polarization rotation with $>5\sigma$ statistical significance,
they lack the ability to differentiate this effect from a systematic
instrumental polarization rotation. Here, we motivate the search for cosmic
polarization rotation from current CMB data as well as independent radio galaxy
and quasar polarization measurements. We argue that an improvement in
calibration accuracy would allow the precise measurement of parity- and
Lorentz-violating effects. We describe the CalSat space-based polarization
calibrator that will provide stringent control of systematic polarization angle
calibration uncertainties to $0.05^\circ$ -- an order of magnitude improvement
over current CMB polarization calibrators. CalSat-based calibration could be
used with current CMB polarimeters searching for $B$-mode polarization,
effectively turning them into probes of cosmic parity violation, i.e. without
the need to build dedicated instruments.

We simultaneously modelled the photometric and spectroscopic data-sets using

density of $\rho_\mathrm{p}=0.459\pm0.083$ g/cm$^{3}$. The radius of KOI-183b
is consistent with both theoretical models for irradiated coreless giant
planets and expectations based on empirical laws. The inclination of the
stellar spin axis suggests that the system is aligned along the line of sight.
We detected a tentative secondary eclipse of the planet at a 2-$\sigma$
confidence level ($\Delta F_{\mathrm{ec}}=14.2\pm6.6$ ppm) and found that the
orbit might have a small non-zero eccentricity of $e=0.019^{+0.028}_{-0.014}$.
With a Bond albedo of $A_\mathrm{B}=0.037\pm0.019$, KOI-183b is one of the

networks, and their contributions to the global energy consumption increase
rapidly due to the surges of data traffic. With the development of green energy
technologies, base stations (BSs) can be powered by green energy in order to
reduce the on-grid energy consumption, and subsequently reduce the carbon
footprints. However, equipping a BS with a green energy system incurs
additional capital expenditure (CAPEX) that is determined by the size of the
green energy generator, the battery capacity, and other installation expenses.
In this paper, we introduce and investigate the green energy provisioning (GEP)
problem which aims to minimize the CAPEX of deploying green energy systems in
BSs while satisfying the QoS requirements of cellular networks. The GEP problem
is challenging because it involves the optimization over multiple time slots
and across multiple BSs. We decompose the GEP problem into the weighted energy
minimization problem and the green energy system sizing problem, and propose a
green energy provisioning solution consisting of the provision cost aware
traffic load balancing algorithm and the binary energy system sizing algorithm
to solve the sub-problems and subsequently solve the GEP problem. We validate
the performance and the viability of the proposed green energy provisioning

collisions has been the focus of a concerted research effort over the past
10-15 years, with a recent focus on transverse momentum-dependent (or
""unintegrated"") parton distributions and their high-energy behavior. With the
advent of high-energy proton-nucleus collisions at RHIC and the LHC, we are
able to experimentally test this behavior for the first time.
  In this dissertation, I examine two sample predictions of this high-energy
behavior. First, I analyze the azimuthal angular correlation for Drell-Yan pair
and associated hadron production. I show that the correlation is a sensitive
probe of the underlying gluon distribution, and a proper prediction of the
correlation at all angles requires a gluon distribution with physically
realistic behavior at all momenta. I'll then describe a numerical calculation
of the cross section for inclusive hadron production, incorporating all
corrections up to next-to-leading order in the strong coupling. The results of
the calculation are negative at high transverse momentum, which is surprising
but may be mathematically reasonable, since the perturbative approximation to
the cross section may break down under those kinematic conditions. However, it
may be possible to make meaningful predictions for the nuclear modification
ratio $R_{pA}$ despite the negative cross section.
  Moving beyond next-to-leading order, I examine two proposed methods of curing
the negativity: first, a straightforward resummation of selected higher-order
terms corresponding to gluon loop diagrams, and the use of exact kinematic
formulas, incorporating terms which disappear in the infinite-energy limit.
Using these methods, the calculation can be adapted to produce reasonable
results at high transverse momentum.

across mobile networks. In order to provision high network capacity, small cell
base stations (SCBSs) are widely deployed. Owing to the close proximity to
mobile users, SCBSs can effectively enhance the network capacity and offloading
traffic load from macro BSs (MBSs). However, the cost-effective backhaul may
not be readily available for SCBSs, thus leading to backhaul constraints in
small cell networks (SCNs). Enabling cache in BSs may mitigate the backhaul
constraints in SCNs. Moreover, the dense deployment of SCBSs may incur
excessive energy consumption. To alleviate brown power consumption, renewable
energy will be explored to power BSs. In such a network, it is challenging to
dynamically balance traffic load among BSs to optimize the network utilities.
In this paper, we investigate the traffic load balancing in
backhaul-constrained cache-enabled small cell networks powered by hybrid energy
sources. We have proposed a network utility aware (NUA) traffic load balancing
scheme that optimizes user association to strike a tradeoff between the green
power utilization and the traffic delivery latency. On balancing the traffic
load, the proposed NUA traffic load balancing scheme considers the green power
utilization, the traffic delivery latency in both BSs and their backhaul, and
the cache hit ratio. The NUA traffic load balancing scheme allows dynamically
adjusting the tradeoff between the green power utilization and the traffic
delivery latency. We have proved the convergence and the optimality of the
proposed NUA traffic load balancing scheme. Through extensive simulations, we
have compared performance of the NUA traffic load balancing scheme with other
schemes and showed its advantages in backhaul-constrained cache-enabled small
cell networks with hybrid power supplies.

signals, known within some amplitude and time shift, with the focus on
measuring the noise provides an effective way to solve the problem and
marginalise over nuisance parameters. The $\mathcal{F}$-statistic, in
widespread use throughout the gravitation waves community, is included in the
method and suitably generalised to marginalise over linear parameters and noise
at the same time. The method is applied to LPF simulator data and, thanks to
its generality, can also be applied to the data reduction and analysis of
future gravitational wave detectors.

whether connection specificity of such networks can already be fully explained
by the modularity alone. To answer this question, we study two networks, the
neuronal network of C. elegans and the fibre tract network of human brains
yielded through diffusion spectrum imaging (DSI). We compare them to their
respective benchmark networks with varying modularities, which are generated by
link swapping to have desired modularity values but otherwise maximally random.
We find several network properties that are specific to the neural networks and
cannot be fully explained by the modularity alone. First, the clustering
coefficient and the characteristic path length of C. elegans and human
connectomes are both higher than those of the benchmark networks with similar
modularity. High clustering coefficient indicates efficient local information
distribution and high characteristic path length suggests reduced global
integration. Second, the total wiring length is smaller than for the
alternative configurations with similar modularity. This is due to lower
dispersion of connections, which means each neuron in C. elegans connectome or
each region of interest (ROI) in human connectome reaches fewer ganglia or
cortical areas, respectively. Third, both neural networks show lower
algorithmic entropy compared to the alternative arrangements. This implies that
fewer rules are needed to encode for the organisation of neural systems.

in GCs: (anti)correlations between light elements. Among the coupled abundance
trends, the Na-O anticorrelation is the most widely studied. These
anticorrelations are the signature of self-enrichment, i.e., of a formation
mechanism that implies multiple generations of stars. Here we concentrate on
the old, massive, metal-rich OC NGC 6791. We analyzed archival Keck/HIRES
spectra of 15 NGC 6791 main sequence turn-off and evolved stars, concentrating
on the derivation of C, N, O, and Na abundances. We also used WIYN/Hydra
spectra of 21 evolved stars (one is in common). Given the spectral complexity
of the very metal-rich NGC 6791 stars, we employed spectrum synthesis to

reionization is initiated by low mass, radiatively regulated haloes at high
redshift, until more massive haloes appear, which then dominate and complete
the reionization process. We investigate the relation between reionization
history and present-day positions of the satellite population. We find that the
average reionization redshift (zr) of satellites is higher near galaxy centers
(MW and M31). This is due to the inside-out reionization patterns imprinted by
massive haloes within the progenitor during the EoR, which end up forming the
center of the galaxy. Thanks to incomplete dynamical mixing during galaxy
assembly, these early patterns survive down to present day, resulting in a a
clear radial gradient in the average satellites reionization redshift, up to
the virial radius of MW and M31 and beyond. In the lowest emissivity scenario,
the outer satellites are reionized about 180 Myr later than the inner
satellites. This delay decreases with increasing source model emissivity, or in
the case of external reionization by Virgo or M31, because reionization happens
faster overall, and becomes spatially quasi-uniform at the highest emissivity.

different epochs with X-shooter at the VLT. From Voigt-profile fitting, we
derive the column densities log N(Mg I)=11.94+-0.06, log N(Mg II)=14.7+-0.3,

cluster galaxies (BCGs) in the simulation have steep stellar density profiles,
$\rho_*(r) \propto r^{-3}$. Stars dominate the mass density for
$r<10~\rm{kpc}$, and, as a result, the total mass density profiles are steeper
than the Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) profile, in remarkable agreement with
observations. The dark matter halo itself closely follows the NFW form at all
resolved radii ($r\gtrsim3.0~\rm{kpc}$). The EAGLE BCGs have similar surface
brightness and line-of-sight velocity dispersion profiles as the BCGs in the
sample of Newman et al., which have the most detailed measurements currently
available. After subtracting the contribution of the stars to the central
density, Newman et al. infer significantly shallower slopes than the NFW value,
in contradiction with the EAGLE results. We discuss possible reasons for this
discrepancy, and conclude that an inconsistency between the kinematical model
adopted by Newman et al. for their BCGs, which assumes isotropic stellar
orbits, and the kinematical structure of the EAGLE BCGs, in which the orbital
stellar anisotropy varies with radius and tends to be radially biased, could
explain at least part of the discrepancy.

In this paper, we investigate the electronic structure of the transition metal
monoxides MnO, CoO, and NiO in their undistorted rock-salt structure within a
fully iterated quasiparticle self-consistent GW (QPscGW) scheme. We study the
convergence of the QPscGW method, i.e., how the quasiparticle energy
eigenvalues and wavefunctions converge as a function of the QPscGW iterations,
and we compare the converged outputs obtained from different starting
wavefunctions. We find that the convergence is slow and that a one-shot
G$_0$W$_0$ calculation does not significantly improve the initial eigenvalues
and states. It is important to notice that in some cases the ""path"" to
convergence may go through energy band reordering which cannot be captured by
the simple initial unperturbed Hamiltonian. When we reach a fully iterated
solution, the converged density of states, band-gaps and magnetic moments of
these oxides are found to be only weakly dependent on the choice of the
starting wavefunctions and in reasonably good agreement with the experiment.
Finally, this approach provides a clear picture of the interplay between the
various orbitals near the Fermi level of these simple transition metal
monoxides. The results of these accurate {\it ab initio} calculations can
provide input for models aiming at describing the low energy physics in these
materials.

includes (i) taus modeled as entropic springs between microtubules, (ii)
removal of taus from the bundles due to phosphorylation, and (iii) a possible
depletion force between microtubules due to these dissociated phosphorylated
taus. We equilibrate upon tau removal using steepest descent relaxation. In the
absence of the depletion force, the transverse rigidity to radial compression
of the bundle falls to zero at about 60% tau occupancy, in agreement with
standard percolation theory results. However, with the attractive depletion
force, spring removal leads to a first order collapse of the bundles over a
wide range of tau occupancies for physiologically realizable conditions. While
our simplest calculations assume a constant concentration of microtubule
intercalants to mediate the depletion force, including a dependence that is
linear in the detached taus yields the same collapse. Applying percolation
theory to removal of taus at microtubule tips, which are likely to be the
protective sites against dynamic instability, we argue that the microtubule
instability can only obtain at low tau occupancy, from 0.06-0.30 depending upon
the tau coordination at the microtubule tips. Hence, the collapse we discover
is likely to be more robust over a wide range of tau occupancies than the
dynamic instability. We suggest in vitro tests of our predicted collapse.

a round trip to the database on every cache transaction.
  Existing incoherent cache technologies are oblivious to transactional data
access, even if the backend database supports transactions. We propose T-Cache,
a novel caching policy for read-only transactions in which inconsistency is
tolerable (won't cause safety violations) but undesirable (has a cost). T-Cache
improves cache consistency despite asynchronous and unreliable communication
between the cache and the database. We define cache-serializability, a variant
of serializability that is suitable for incoherent caches, and prove that with
unbounded resources T-Cache implements this new specification. With limited
resources, T-Cache allows the system manager to choose a trade-off between
performance and consistency.
  Our evaluation shows that T-Cache detects many inconsistencies with only
nominal overhead. We use synthetic workloads to demonstrate the efficacy of
T-Cache when data accesses are clustered and its adaptive reaction to workload
changes. With workloads based on the real-world topologies, T-Cache detects
43-70% of the inconsistencies and increases the rate of consistent transactions

non-parameteric methods, relying on regularization strategies, to handle the
so-called bias/variance trade-off. This paper introduces an impulse response
estimator which relies on an $\ell_2$-type regularization including a
rank-penalty derived using the log-det heuristic as a smooth approximation to
the rank function. This allows to account for different properties of the
estimated impulse response (e.g. smoothness and stability) while also
penalizing high-complexity models. This also allows to account and enforce
coupling between different input-output channels in MIMO systems. According to
the Bayesian paradigm, the parameters defining the relative weight of the two
regularization terms as well as the structure of the rank penalty are estimated
optimizing the marginal likelihood. Once these hyperameters have been
estimated, the impulse response estimate is available in closed form.
Experiments show that the proposed method is superior to the estimator relying
on the ""classic"" $\ell_2$-regularization alone as well as those based in atomic
and nuclear norm.

boundary conditions used: periodic boundary conditions allow for rotation at
top and bottom of the pillar, and result in an S shaped buckle, by contrast
fixed boundaries enforce a C shape. Pillars with a length to width ratio closer
to that used in experimental micropillar compression studies show deformation
behaviour dominated by slip, in agreement with the experiments. For
micropillars oriented along <100>, slip occurs on <110> planes and localized
slip bands are formed. Pillars of this size experience higher stresses than
bulk materials before yielding takes place. One might expect that this may be
in part due to the lack of nucleation sites needed to induce slip. However,
further simulations with possible dislocation sources: a shorter iron pillar

four-parton scattering amplitudes in QCD, giving explicit results at two loops
and higher orders, and going beyond next-to-leading logarithmic (NLL) accuracy.
Building upon recent results, we use the techniques of infrared factorization
to investigate the failure of the simplest form of Regge factorization,
starting at next-to-next-to-leading logarithmic accuracy (NNLL) in ln(s/|t|).
We provide detailed accounts and explicit expressions for the terms responsible
for this breaking in the case of two-loop and three-loop quark and gluon
amplitudes in QCD; in particular, we recover and explain a known
non-logarithmic double-pole contribution at two-loops, and we compute all
non-factorizing single-logarithmic singular contributions at three loops.
Conversely, we use high-energy factorization to show that the hard functions of
infrared factorization vanish in d = 4 to all orders in the coupling, up to NLL
accuracy in ln(s/|t|). This provides clear evidence for the infrared origin of
high-energy logarithms. Finally, we extend earlier studies to t-channel
exchanges of color representations beyond the octet, which enables us to give
predictions based on the dipole formula for single-pole NLL contributions at
three and four loops.

discovered recently and that show a preference for occurring in faint dwarf
galaxies. Understanding why stellar evolution yields different types of stellar
explosions in these environments is fundamental in order to both uncover the
elusive progenitors of SLSNe and to study star formation in dwarf galaxies. In
this paper, we present the first results of our project to study SUperluminous
Supernova Host galaxIES, focusing on the sample for which we have obtained
spectroscopy. We show that SLSNe-I and SLSNe-R (hydrogen-poor) often (~50% in
our sample) occur in a class of galaxies that is known as Extreme Emission Line
Galaxies (EELGs). The probability of this happening by chance is negligible and
we therefore conclude that the extreme environmental conditions and the SLSN
phenomenon are related. In contrast, SLSNe-II (hydrogen-rich) occur in more
massive, more metal-rich galaxies with softer radiation fields. Therefore, if
SLSNe-II constitute a uniform class, their progenitor systems are likely
different from those of H-poor SLSNe. Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are, on average,
not found in as extreme environments as H-poor SLSNe. We propose that H-poor
SLSNe result from the very first stars exploding in a starburst, even earlier
than GRBs. This might indicate a bottom-light initial mass function in these
systems. SLSNe present a novel method of selecting candidate EELGs independent
of their luminosity.

implemented recently on GPUs. However, these usually use simplified models for
non-elastic (NE) proton-nucleus interactions. Our primary goal is to build a
GPU-based proton transport MC with detailed modeling of elastic and NE
collisions. Methods: Using CUDA, we implemented GPU kernels for these tasks:
(1) Simulation of spots from our scanning nozzle configurations, (2) Proton
propagation through CT geometry, considering nuclear elastic scattering,
multiple scattering, and energy loss straggling, (3) Modeling of the
intranuclear cascade stage of NE interactions, (4) Nuclear evaporation
simulation, and (5) Statistical error estimates on the dose. To validate our
MC, we performed: (1) Secondary particle yield calculations in NE collisions,
(2) Dose calculations in homogeneous phantoms, (3) Re-calculations of head and
neck plans from a commercial treatment planning system (TPS), and compared with
Geant4.9.6p2/TOPAS. Results: Yields, energy and angular distributions of
secondaries from NE collisions on various nuclei agree well with the Geant4
Bertini and Binary cascade models. The 3D-gamma pass rate at 2\%-2 mm for
treatment plan simulations is typically 98\%. The net calculation time on a
NVIDIA GTX680 card, including all data transfers, is $\sim$20 s for
$1\times10^7$ proton histories. Conclusions: Our GPU-based MC is the first of
its kind to include a detailed nuclear model to handle NE interactions of
protons with any nucleus. Dosimetric calculations are in very good agreement
with Geant4/TOPAS. Our MC is being used to perform fast routine clinical QA of
pencil-beam based treatment plans, and has also been adopted as the dose engine
in a clinically-applicable MC-based IMPT TPS. The detailed nuclear modeling
will allow us to perform very fast linear energy transfer and neutron dose
estimates on the GPU.

produce enough Cherenkov photons allowing detection by telescopes with large

possibility of observations of showers, induced by high energy particles in the
atmosphere, in the presence of clouds which are completely or partially opaque
for Cherenkov radiation. We show how the image parameters of the Cherenkov
light distribution on the telescope camera are influenced for different opacity

calculate the scaled LENGTH and WIDTH parameters with the purpose to separate
gamma-ray and proton initiated showers in real data. We show, that the high
level of the night sky background effects the selection efficiency of the
gamma-ray initiated showers. However, application of the higher image cleaning
level significantly improves expected quality factors. The estimated gamma-ray
selection efficiency for the detector with the camera FOV limited to 8 deg. is
slightly better than for the camera with unlimited FOV, although the number of
identified gamma-ray events is lower. We conclude that large Cherenkov
telescopes with large FOV cameras can be used for observations of very high

magnetic field, are all important to the net response of the superconductor.
Capturing these features, in general, precludes analytical description of

evolution time for spins and orbits and their final states. The purpose of this
paper is to refine recent model of the anelastic tidal dissipation in the
central dense region of giant planets, commonly assumed to retain a large
amount of heavy elements, which constitute an important source of dissipation.
The previous paper evaluated the impact of the presence of the static fluid
envelope on the tidal deformation of the core and on the associated anelastic
tidal dissipation, through the tidal quality factor Qc. We examine here its
impact on the corresponding effective anelastic tidal dissipation, through the
effective tidal quality factor Qp. We show that the strength of this mechanism
mainly depends on mass concentration. In the case of Jupiter- and Saturn-like
planets, it can increase their effective tidal dissipation by, around, a factor
2.4 and 2 respectively. In particular, the range of the rheologies compatible
with the observations is enlarged compared to the results issued from previous
formulations. We derive here an improved expression of the tidal effective
factor Qp in terms of the tidal dissipation factor of the core Qc, without
assuming the commonly used assumptions. When applied to giant planets, the
formulation obtained here allows a better match between the an elastic core's
tidal dissipation of a two-layer model and the observations.

Telescope (HST) that provides a sample of local universe laboratory galaxies in
which to study the astrophysics of the visibility and strength of the
Lyman-alpha (Lya) line of hydrogen. This article presents an overview of the
survey, its selection function and HST imaging observations. The sample was
selected from the GALEX+SDSS catalogue at z=0.028-0.19, in order to allow Lya
to be captured with combinations of long pass filters in the Solar Blind
Channel (SBC) of HST/ACS. In addition, LARS utilises Halpha and Hbeta narrow,
and U, B, i broad-band imaging with ACS and WFC3. In order to study galaxies in
which large numbers of Lya photons are produced we demanded an Halpha
equivalent width > 100{\AA}. The sample of 14 galaxies covers far UV (FUV)
luminosities that overlaps with those of high-z Lya emitters and Lyman Break
Galaxies (LBGs). We present the reduction steps used to obtain the Lya images,
including our LARS eXtraction software (LaXs) which utilises pixel-by-pixel
spectral synthesis fitting to subtract the continuum at Lya. We demonstrate
that the use of SBC long pass filters dramatically increase the signal to noise
compared to the nominal Lya filter in SBC. To exemplify, we present results for
Mrk 259. This irregular galaxy shows extended but strongly asymmetric Lya
emission. Spectroscopy from HST/COS show a moderate outflow in the neutral ISM
and an asymmetric Lya profile. Radiative transfer modeling is able to reproduce
the Lya line profile, confirming the presence of an outflow. The integrated
photometry provides a Lya luminosity of 1.3E42 erg/s an equivalent width W(Lya)
=45{\AA} and a FUV absolute magnitude -19.2. Mrk 259 would hence be detectable
in high-z Lya and LBG surveys. The total Lya escape fraction is 12%, similar to
that observed at z>4. (shortened)

Most notably, thermodynamics uses partial derivatives in ways that students
often find confusing. As part of a collaboration with mathematics faculty, we
are at the beginning of a study of the teaching of partial derivatives, a goal
of better aligning the teaching of multivariable calculus with the needs of
students in STEM disciplines. As a part of this project, we have performed a
pilot study of expert understanding of partial derivatives across three
disciplines: physics, engineering and mathematics. Our interviews made use of
the Partial Derivative Machine (PDM), which is a mechanical system featuring
four observable and controllable properties, of which any two are independent.
Using the PDM, we probed expert understanding of partial derivatives in an
experimental context in which there is not a known functional form. Through
these three interviews, we found that the mathematicians exhibited a striking
difference in their understanding of derivatives relative to the other groups.
The physicists and engineers were quick to use measurements to find a numeric
approximation for a derivative. In contrast, the mathematicians repeatedly
returned to speculation as to the functional form, and although they were
comfortable drawing qualitative conclusions about the system from measurements,
were reluctant to approximate the derivative through measurement. This pilot
study led us to further questions. How do fields differ in their experts'
concept image of partial derivatives? What representations of partial
derivatives are preferred by experts? We plan to address these questions by
means of further interviews with a wider range of disciplinary experts.

video services become increasingly important for video service providers, such
as Youtube and Netflix, while multi-view 3D videos are potential to bring out
varied innovative applications. However, enabling multi-view 3D video services
may overwhelm WiFi networks when we multicast every view of a video. In this
paper, therefore, we propose to incorporate depth-image-based rendering (DIBR),
which allows each mobile client to synthesize the desired view from nearby left
and right views, to effectively reduce the bandwidth consumption. Moreover, due
to varied channel conditions, each client may suffer from different packet loss
probabilities, and retransmissions incur additional bandwidth consumption. To
address this issue, we first analyze the merit of view protection via DIBR for
multi-view video multicast and then design a new protocol, named Multi-View
Group Management Protocol (MVGMP), for the dynamic group management of
multicast users. Simulation results manifest that our protocol effectively
reduces bandwidth consumption and increases the probability for each client to
successfully playback the desired view of a multi-view 3D video.

networks that reflects spatial correlations at the instant of cross-linking. We
identify suitable order parameters and derive a free-energy functional in the

sensitive to the strength of the hyperfine interaction, which can be controlled

additional dephasing beyond the radiative limit and \gamma = 230 MHz (0.95 \mu

is much faster than that for 1D disk arrays composed only of vortex states, and
the propagation speed for the parallel polarization ordering is increased,

is that ET would register about $50-100$ strongly lensed inspiral events per
year. Only the scenario in which nascent BHs receive strong kick gives the
predictions of a few events per year. Such lensed events would be dominated by
the BH-BH merging binary systems. Our results suggest that during a few years

Maynard, who found a simpler sieve-theoretic argument that gave the improved

properties of TeV-bright shell-type supernova remnants (SNRs) and to explore
their nature. Methods. In the leptonic scenario for the TeV emission, the
$\gamma$-ray emission is produced via Inverse Compton scattering of background
soft photons by high-energy electrons accelerated by the shocks of the SNRs.
The TeV emissivity is proportional to the magnetic field energy density and MHD
simulations can be used to model the TeV structure of such remnants directly.
2D MHD simulations for SNRs are then performed under the assumption that the
ambient interstellar medium is turbulent with the magnetic field and density
fluctuations following a Kolmogorov-like power-law spectrum. Results. (1) As
expected, these simulations confirm early 1D and 2D modelings of these sources,
namely the hydrodynamical evolution of the shock waves and amplification of
magnetic field by Rayleigh-Taylor convective flows and by shocks propagating in
a turbulent medium; (2) We reproduce rather complex morphological structure for
$\gamma$-rays, suggesting intrinsic variations of the source morphology not
related to the structure of the progenitor and environment; (3)The observed
radial profile of several remnants are well reproduced with an ambient medium
density of $0.1-1$ cm$^{-3}$. An even lower ambient density leads to a sharper
drop of the TeV brightness with radius than what is observed near the outer
edge of these remnants. Conclusions. In a turbulent background medium, we can
reproduce the observed characteristics of several shell-type TeV SNRs with
reasonable parameters except for a higher ambient density than that inferred
from X-ray observations.

techniques, is advocated as a way of avoiding the curse of dimensionality. Some
attention is given to a structure in which the state variable is driven by a
continuous time process, with exact inference typically infeasible in this case
as a result of intractable transitions. The ABC method is demonstrated using
the unscented Kalman filter as a fast and simple way of producing an
approximation in this setting, with a stochastic volatility model for financial
returns used for illustration.

Deformation parameters $\beta$ are then introduced to describe non-spherical

$R_{0}(1+\beta_2Y^0_2+\beta_4Y^0_4)$. But when a nucleus is non-spherical, the
$R_{0}$ and $a$ inferred from electron scattering experiments that integrate
over all nuclear orientations cannot be used directly as the parameters in the
Woods-Saxon distribution. In addition, the $\beta_2$ values typically derived
from the reduced electric quadrupole transition probability B(E2)$\uparrow$ are
not directly related to the $\beta_2$ values used in the spherical harmonic
expansion. B(E2)$\uparrow$ is more accurately related to the intrinsic

halo has to be 20+/-13% relative to that in the solar vicinity, in order for
the detected number of stars fainter than 20.5 mag in the H band to match with
the predicted value from the model. In the thick disk, the number density of
M-dwarfs must be reduced (52+/-13%) or the scale height must be decreased (~600
pc). Alternatively, overall fractions of the halo and thick disks can be
significantly reduced to achieve the same effect, because our sample mainly
consists of faint M-dwarfs. Our results imply that the M-dwarf population in
regions distant from the Galactic plane is significantly smaller than
previously thought. We then discussed the implications this has on the
suitability of the model predictions for the prediction of non-companion faint
stars in direct imaging extrasolar planet surveys by using the best-fit number
densities.

double stranded DNA whose ends are subjected to a time dependent periodic force
with frequency ($\omega$) and amplitude ($G$). For the static force, i.e.,
$\omega \to 0$, the DNA is in equilibrium with no hysteresis. On increasing
$\omega$, the area of the hysteresis loop initially increases and becomes
maximum at frequency $\omega^{*}(G)$, which depends on the force amplitude $G$.
If the frequency is further increased, we find that for lower amplitudes the
loop area decreases monotonically to zero, but for higher amplitudes it has an
oscillatory component. The height of subsequent peaks decrease and finally the
loop area becomes zero at very high frequencies. The number of peaks depends on
the length of the DNA. We give a simple analysis to estimate the frequencies at
which maxima and minima occurs in the loop area. We find that the area of the
hysteresis loop scales as $1/\omega$ in high-frequency regime whereas, it
scales as $G^{\alpha} \omega^{\beta}$ with exponents $\alpha =1$ and $\beta =

pseudoscalar can have a very low mass without violating the LEP exclusion
constraints and it can potentially provide a hallmark signature of non-minimal
supersymmetry at the LHC. In this analysis we revisit the light pseudoscalar in
the NMSSM with partial universality at some high unification scale. We
delineate the regions of the model's parameter space that are consistent with
the up-to-date theoretical and experimental constraints, from both Higgs boson
searches and elsewhere (most notably $b$-physics), and examine to what extent
they can be probed by the LHC. To this end we review the most important
production channels of such a Higgs state and assess the scope of its
observation at the forthcoming Run-2 of the LHC. We conclude that the
$b\bar{b}$-associated production of the pseudoscalar, which has been emphasised
in previous studies, does not carry much promise anymore, given the measured
mass of the Higgs boson at the LHC. However, the decays of one of the heavier
scalar Higgsbosons of the NMSSM can potentially lead to the discovery of its
light pseudoscalar. Especially promising are the decays of one or both of the
two lightest scalar states into a pseudoscalar pair and of the heaviest scalar
into a pseudoscalar and a $Z$ boson. Since the latter channel has not been
explored in detail in the literature so far, we provide details of some

observables of the subsystems of a composite system, and the quantumness of
their mutual information are widely studied characteristics of a system of
spin-1/2 particles. The concept of quantumness of correlations between the
observables of a system is based on incommensurability of the correlations with
the predictions of some local hidden variable (LHV) theory. However, the
concept of quantumness of mutual information does not invoke the LHV theory
explicitly. In this paper, by invoking explicitly the local hidden variable
theory, a measure of quantumness of mutual information, $Q_{LHV}$, for a system
of two spin-1/2 particles is proposed. It is based on finding the difference
between the quantum and classical mutual informations in which the classical
mutual information corresponds to the joint probability of the eigenvalues of
the spins each along a specified direction. The proposed measure circumvents
the need of optimization when the Bloch vector of each spin is non-zero; the
optimization is needed but can be performed analytically exactly when the Bloch
vector of each spin vanishes and is simplified when the Bloch vector of only
one of the spins is zero. In essence, the proposed measure is identical with
the measurement induced disturbance when the Bloch vector of each of the spins
is non-zero. However, whereas the measurement induced disturbance is non-unique
when the Bloch vector of one or both the spins is zero, the proposed measure
even then determines the quantumness of mutual information unambiguously. The
$Q_{LHV}$ is identical with the symmetric discord if the Bloch vector of each
spin vanishes. It is same as the quantum discord if the Bloch vector of only
one spin is zero and if the state in question possesses certain additional
properties.

The presence of antiferromagnetic interactions is inferred from a Curie-Weiss

capacity (Cm) data show a broad maximum at T^max ~ 1.15 K (i.e. T^max/theta_CW
~ 0.05), which is analogous to the the observed broad maximum in the Cm/T data
of a hyper-Kagome system, Na4Ir3O8. In addition, Cm data exhibit a weak kink at
T^* ~ 0.87 K. While the T^max is nearly unchanged, the T^* is systematically
suppressed in an increasing magnetic field (H) up to 80 kOe. For H > 80 kOe,
the Cm data at low temperatures exhibit a characteristic power-law (T^{\alpha})
behavior with an exponent {\alpha} slightly less than 2. Hopping integrals

there is a pressure toward shorter duration of inflation. Therefore, if the
spectral index and the tensor-to-scalar ratio turn out to be different from the

nucleation. Also, the existence of small modulations to the inflaton potential

exponentially increasing amount of data are inevitable. While classical
approaches (e.g. template fitting) are fine for objects of well-known classes,
alternative techniques have to be developed to determine those that do not fit.
Therefore a classification scheme should be based on individual properties
instead of fitting to a global model and therefore loose valuable information.
An important issue when dealing with large data sets is the outlier detection
which at the moment is often treated problem-orientated. Aims: In this paper we
present a method to statistically estimate the redshift z based on a similarity
approach. This allows us to determine redshifts in spectra in emission as well
as in absorption without using any predefined model. Additionally we show how
an estimate of the redshift based on single features is possible. As a
consequence we are e.g. able to filter objects which show multiple redshift
components. We propose to apply this general method to all similar problems in
order to identify objects where traditional approaches fail. Methods: The
redshift estimation is performed by comparing predefined regions in the spectra
and applying a k nearest neighbor regression model for every predefined
emission and absorption region, individually. Results: We estimated a redshift
for more than 50% of the analyzed 16,000 spectra of our reference and test
sample. The redshift estimate yields a precision for every individually tested
feature that is comparable with the overall precision of the redshifts of SDSS.
In 14 spectra we find a significant shift between emission and absorption or
emission and emission lines. The results show already the immense power of this
simple machine learning approach for investigating huge databases such as the
SDSS.

few-layer phosphorene shows a robust direct band gap character, and its band
gap decreases with the number of layers following a power law. The work
function decreases rapidly from monolayer (5.16 eV) to trilayer (4.56 eV), and
then slowly upon further increasing the layer number. Compared to monolayer
phosphorene, there is a drastic decrease of hole effective mass along the ridge
(zigzag) direction for bilayer phosphorene, indicating a strong interlayer
coupling and screening effect. Our study suggests that 1). Few-layer
phosphorene with a layer-dependent band gap and a robust direct band gap
character is promising for efficient solar energy harvest. 2). Few-layer
phosphorene outperforms monolayer counterpart in terms of a lighter carrier
effective mass, a higher carrier density and a weaker scattering due to
enhanced screening. 3). The layer-dependent band edges and work functions of
few-layer phosphorene allow for modification of Schottky barrier with enhanced

$\mathbb{C}\mathbb{P}^n$ complex manifolds are addressed. In the simplest $n=1$
case, where the target manifold is the $\mathbb{S}^2$ sphere, we describe the
scalar fields by means of stereographic maps. In this case when the
$\mathbb{U}(1)$ symmetry is gauged and Maxwell and mass terms are allowed, the
model accommodates stable self-dual vortices of two kinds with different
energies per unit length and where the Higgs field winds at the cores around
the two opposite poles of the sphere. Allowing for dielectric functions in the
magnetic field, similar and richer self-dual vortices of different species in
the south and north charts can be found by slightly modifying the potential.
Two different situations are envisaged: either the vacuum orbit lies on a
parallel in the sphere, or one pole and the same parallel form the vacuum
orbit. Besides the self-dual vortices of two species, there exist BPS domain
walls in the second case. Replacing the Maxwell contribution of the gauge field
to the action by the second Chern-Simons secondary class, only possible in
$(2+1)$-dimensional Minkowski space-time, new BPS topological defects of two
species appear. Namely, both BPS vortices and domain ribbons in the south and
the north charts exist because the vacuum orbit consits of the two poles and
one parallel. Formulation of the gauged $\mathbb{C}\mathbb{P}^2$ model in a
Reference chart shows a self-dual structure such that BPS semi-local vortices
exist. The transition functions to the second or third charts break the
$\mathbb{U}(1)\times\mathbb{S}\mathbb{U}(2)$ semi-local symmetry, but there is
still room for standard self-dual vortices of the second species. The same
structures encompassing $N$ complex scalar fields are easily generalized to
gauged $\mathbb{C}\mathbb{P}^N$ models.

optimal representation is the hardest to distinguish from the original data

as probability distributions provides an efficient visualization method and, in
one dimension, an ordering of network nodes and edges. Coarse-grained
representations of the input network enable both efficient data compression and
hierarchical visualization to achieve high quality representations of larger

  in surface climatology","23 pages, 5 figures, data and methods section",,,,"physics.ao-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The Earth has warmed in the last century with the most rapid warming
occurring near the surface in the arctic. This enhanced surface warming in the
Arctic is partly because the extra heat is trapped in a thin layer of air near
the surface due to the persistent stable-stratification found in this region.
The warming of the surface air due to the extra heat depends upon the amount of
turbulent mixing in the atmosphere, which is described by the depth of the
atmospheric boundary layer (ABL). In this way the depth of the ABL determines
the effective response of the surface air temperature to perturbations in the
climate forcing. The ABL depth can vary from tens of meters to a few kilometers
which presents a challenge for global climate models which cannot resolve the
shallower layers. Here we show that the uncertainties in the depth of the ABL
can explain up to 60 percent of the difference between the simulated and
observed surface air temperature trends and 50 percent of the difference in
temperature variability for the Climate Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5
(CMIP5) ensemble mean. Previously the difference between observed and modeled
temperature was thought to be largely due to differences in individual models
treatment of large-scale circulation and other factors related to the forcing,
such as sea-ice extent. While this can be an important source of uncertainty in
climate projections, our results show that it is the representation of the ABL
in these models which is the main reason global climate models cannot reproduce
the observed spatial and temporal pattern of climate change. This highlights
the need for a better description of the stably-stratified ABL in global
climate models in order to constrain the current uncertainty in climate
variability and projections of climate change in the surface layer.

levels of two species. Intriguingly, such clusters are also able to maintain
geometrical and electronic integrity of their cores at temperatures up to 1000
K (e.g. for Ni$_{7}$Ag$_{27}$ cluster). Furthermore, we also show the
possibility of creating ordered arrays of such magnetic clusters on a suitable
support by soft-landing pre-formed clusters on the surface, without introducing
much disturbance in geometrical and electronic structure of the cluster. We
illustrate this approach with the example of Ni$_{13}$Ag$_{38}$ clusters
adsorbed on the Si(111)-(7$\times$7) surface, which, having two distinctive
halves to the unit cell, acts as a selective template for cluster deposition.

While the magneto-rotational instability is considered to operate in

suggested as a possible alternative. Our goal is to study the characteristics
of this instability and the efficiency of angular momentum transport, in
extended discs, under the influence of radiative transport and irradiation from
the central star. We use multi-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations to model a
larger section of an accretion disc. First we study inviscid and weakly viscous
discs using a fixed radial temperature profile in two and three spatial
dimensions. The simulations are then extended to include radiative transport
and irradiation from the central star. In agreement with previous studies we
find for the isothermal disc a sustained unstable state with a weak positive
angular momentum transport of the order of $\alpha \approx 10^{-4}$. Under the
inclusion of radiative transport the disc cools off and the turbulence
terminates. For discs irradiated from the central star we find again a
persistent instability with a similar $\alpha$ value as for the isothermal
case. We find that the VSI can indeed generate sustained turbulence in discs
albeit at a relatively low level with $\alpha$ about few times $10^{-4}$

are of fundamental interest for the development of novel memory devices that

The great challenge is to create room temperature multiferroic materials with
strongly coupled ferroelectric and ferromagnetic (or ferrimagnetic) orderings.
BiFeO3 has been the most heavily investigated single-phase multiferroic to date
due to the coexistence of its magnetic order and ferroelectric order at room
temperature. However, there is no net magnetic moment in the cycloidal
(antiferromagnetic-like) magnetic state of bulk BiFeO3, which severely limits
its realistic applications in electric field controlled spintronic devices.
Here, we predict that double perovskite Zn2FeOsO6 is a new multiferroic with
properties superior to BiFeO3. First, there are strong ferroelectricity and
strong ferrimagnetism at room temperature in Zn2FeOsO6. Second, the easy-plane
of the spontaneous magnetization can be switched by an external electric field,
evidencing the strong magnetoelectric coupling existing in this system. Our
results suggest that ferrimagnetic 3d-5d double perovskite may therefore be
used to achieve voltage control of magnetism in future spintronic devices.

At the beginning of the observation the QPO was at around 8 mHz, together with
a possible second harmonic. About 12 ks into the observation a type I X-ray
burst occurred and the QPO disappeared; the QPO reappeared ~25 ks after the
burst and it was present until the end of the observation. We divided the
observation into four segments to study the evolution of the spectral
properties of the source during intervals with and without mHz QPO. We find
that the temperature of the neutron-star surface increases from the QPO segment
to the non-QPO segment, and vice versa. We also find a strong correlation
between the frequency of the mHz QPO and the temperature of a black-body
component in the energy spectrum representing the temperature of neutron-star

the mHz QPO depends on the variation of the heat flux from the neutron star

feasibility problems by studying this method for a class of nonconvex
optimization problem. While the convergence properties of the method for convex
problems have been well studied, far less is known in the nonconvex setting. In
this paper, for the direct adaptation of the method to minimize the sum of a
proper closed function $g$ and a smooth function $f$ with a Lipschitz
continuous gradient, we show that if the step-size parameter is smaller than a
computable threshold and the sequence generated has a cluster point, then it
gives a stationary point of the optimization problem. Convergence of the whole
sequence and a local convergence rate are also established under the additional
assumption that $f$ and $g$ are semi-algebraic. We also give simple sufficient
conditions guaranteeing the boundedness of the sequence generated. We then
apply our nonconvex DR splitting method to finding a point in the intersection
of a closed convex set $C$ and a general closed set $D$ by minimizing the
squared distance to $C$ subject to $D$. We show that if either set is bounded
and the step-size parameter is smaller than a computable threshold, then the
sequence generated from the DR splitting method is actually bounded.
Consequently, the sequence generated will have cluster points that are
stationary for an optimization problem, and the whole sequence is convergent
under an additional assumption that $C$ and $D$ are semi-algebraic. We achieve
these results based on a new merit function constructed particularly for the DR
splitting method. Our preliminary numerical results indicate that our DR
splitting method usually outperforms the alternating projection method in
finding a sparse solution of a linear system, in terms of both the solution
quality and the number of iterations taken.

transition layer emission line of CIV 1550 A. The CIV and X-ray luminosities
turn out typical of RS CVn stars. The extended set of available photometric

near-infrared (Keenan et al. 2010, 2012) indicated that the local universe may
be under-dense on radial scales of several hundred megaparsecs (Mpc). Such a
large-scale local under-density could introduce significant biases in the
measurement and interpretation of cosmological observables, such as the
inferred effects of dark energy on the rate of expansion. In Keenan et al.
(2013), we measured the K-band luminosity density as a function of distance
from us to test for such a local under-density. We made this measurement over
the redshift range 0.01 < z < 0.2 (radial distances D ~ 50-800 Mpc). We found
that the shape of the K-band luminosity function is relatively constant as a
function of distance and environment. We derive a local (z < 0.07, D < 300 Mpc)
K-band luminosity density that agrees well with previously published studies.
At z > 0.07, we measure an increasing luminosity density that by z~ 0.1 rises
to a value of ~1.5 times higher than that measured locally. This implies that
the stellar mass density follows a similar trend. Assuming that the underlying
dark matter distribution is traced by this luminous matter, this suggests that
the local mass density may be lower than the global mass density of the
universe at an amplitude and on a scale that is sufficient to introduce
significant biases into the measurement of basic cosmological observables. At
least one study has shown that an under-density of roughly this amplitude and
scale could resolve the apparent tension between direct local measurements of
the Hubble constant and those inferred by Planck team. Other theoretical
studies have concluded that such an under-density could account for what looks
like an accelerating expansion, even when no dark energy is present.

Fernandez-Pacheco [Phys. Rev. D 19, 3173 (1979)] is known to reproduce exactly
the location of the zero-temperature critical point and the correlation length
exponent $\nu=1$. Recently, Miyazaki and Nishimori [Phys. Rev. E 87, 032154

$d>1$ by applying the Fernandez-Pacheco procedure successively in each
direction. To avoid the inequivalence of directions of their approach, we
propose here an alternative procedure where the $d$ directions are treated on
the same footing. For the pure model, this leads to the correlation length
exponents $\nu \simeq 0.625$ in $d=2$ (to be compared with the 3D classical
Ising model exponent $\nu \simeq 0.63$) and $\nu \simeq 0.5018$ (to be compared

disordered model in dimension $d=2$, either ferromagnetic or spin-glass, the
numerical application of the renormalization rules to samples of linear size
$L=4096$ yields that the transition is governed by an Infinite Disorder Fixed
Point, with the activated exponent $\psi \simeq 0.65$, the typical correlation
exponent $\nu_{typ} \simeq 0.44$ and the finite-size correlation exponent

wireless networks using instantly decodable network coding (IDNC) based
device-to-device (D2D) communications. In a D2D configuration, devices in the
network can help hasten the recovery of the lost packets of other devices in
their transmission range by sending network coded packets. Unlike previous
works that assumed fully connected network, this paper proposes a partially
connected configuration in which the decision should be made not only on the
packet combinations but also on the set of transmitting devices. First, the
different events occurring at each device are identified so as to derive an
expression for the probability distribution of the decoding delay. The joint
optimization problem over the set of transmitting devices and the packet
combinations of each is, then, formulated. The optimal solution of the joint
optimization problem is derived using a graph theory approach by introducing
the cooperation graph and reformulating the problem as a maximum weight clique
problem in which the weight of each vertex is the contribution of the device
identified by the vertex. Through extensive simulations, the decoding delay
experienced by all devices in the Point to Multi-Point (PMP) configuration, the
fully connected D2D (FC-D2D) configuration and the more practical partially
connected D2D (PC-D2D) configuration are compared. Numerical results suggest
that the PC-D2D outperforms the FC-D2D and provides appreciable gain especially

environments within the formalism derived by Hennebelle \& Chabrier. We focus
on conditions encountered in progenitors of massive early type galaxies and
starburst regions. We show that, when applying the concept of turbulent Jeans
mass as the characteristic mass for fragmentation in a turbulent medium,
instead of the standard thermal Jeans mass for purely gravitational
fragmentation, the peak of the IMF in such environments is shifted towards
smaller masses, leading to a bottom-heavy IMF, as suggested by various
observations. In very dense and turbulent environments, we predict that the
high-mass tail of the IMF can become even steeper than the standard Salpeter
IMF, with a limit for the power law exponent $\alpha\simeq -2.7$, in agreement
with recent observational determinations. This steepening is a direct
consequence of the high densities and Mach values in such regions but also of
the time dependence of the fragmentation process, as incorporated in the
Hennebelle-Chabrier theory. We provide analytical parametrizations of these
IMFs in such environments, to be used in galaxy evolution calculations. We also
calculate the star formation rates and the mass-to-light ratios expected under
such extreme conditions and show that they agree well with the values inferred
in starburst environments and massive high-redshift galaxies. This reinforces
the paradigm of star formation as being a universal process, i.e. the direct
outcome of gravitationally unstable fluctuations in a density field initially
generated by large scale shock-dominated turbulence. This globally enables us
to infer the variations of the stellar IMF and related properties for atypical
galactic conditions.

Contrary to the original Zhevakin's work the triple-alpha process is the basic
thermonuclear fusion reaction within the star under investigation. The model
has four dimensionless numbers. For real Cepheids, the magnitude of each of
these dimensionless numbers is estimated. It is found that dimensionless
numbers associated with both radiation confinement and thermonuclear energy
generation are sufficiently less than 1, that is, pure hydrodynamic effects
prevail in the model studied. For this case, the model system reduces to the
well-known equation of Bhatnagar and Kothari, which describes adiabatic radial
pulsations. But solutions of this equation do not have many of real Cepheid
curve's features (for instance, asymmetry of luminosity curves about mid-period
points). Thus, the model under consideration is not satisfactory for describing
Cepheid's pulsations. The problem of construction of an adequate simplified
model of stellar pulsations is briefly discussed.

powerful structures known by the Computer Science community for deriving
probabilistic inferences. However, modern cognitive psychology has revealed
that human decisions could not follow the rules of classical probability
theory, because humans cannot process large amounts of data in order to make
judgements. Consequently, the inferences performed are based on limited data
coupled with several heuristics, leading to violations of the law of total
probability. This means that probabilistic graphical models based on classical
probability theory are too limited to fully simulate and explain various
aspects of human decision making.
  Quantum probability theory was developed in order to accommodate the
paradoxical findings that the classical theory could not explain. Recent
findings in cognitive psychology revealed that quantum probability can fully
describe human decisions in an elegant framework. Their findings suggest that,
before taking a decision, human thoughts are seen as superposed waves that can
interfere with each other, influencing the final decision.
  In this work, we propose a new Bayesian Network based on the psychological
findings of cognitive scientists. We made experiments with two very well known
Bayesian Networks from the literature. The results obtained revealed that the
quantum like Bayesian Network can affect drastically the probabilistic
inferences, specially when the levels of uncertainty of the network are very
high (no pieces of evidence observed). When the levels of uncertainty are very
low, then the proposed quantum like network collapses to its classical
counterpart.

installed in the vertex and tracking part of the CMS experiment will face more
intense radiation environment than the present system was designed for. Thus,
to upgrade the tracker to required performance level, comprehensive
measurements and simulations studies have already been carried out. Essential
information of the performance of an irradiated silicon detector is obtained by
monitoring its charge collection efficiency (CCE). From the evolution of CCE
with fluence, it is possible to directly observe the effect of the radiation
induced defects to the ability of the detector to collect charge carriers
generated by traversing minimum ionizing particles (mip). In this paper the
numerically simulated CCE and CCE loss between the strips of irradiated silicon
strip detectors are presented. The simulations based on Synopsys Sentaurus TCAD
framework were performed before and after irradiation for fluences up to

A two level and non-uniform three level defect models were applied for the
proton irradiation simulations and two level model for neutrons. The results
are presented together with the measurements of strip detectors irradiated by
different particles and fluences and show considerable agreement for both CCE
and its position dependency.

can take the form of distributed denial of service attacks, authentication

critical infrastructure causing its disruption or destruction (power,

exploited for such malicious purposes due to the minimal setup, running and
maintenance costs involved in executing a globally orchestrated attack,
alongside the perceived additional layer of anonymity. In the ever-evolving

major issue of modern astrophysics. Such accretion disks should be stable
against the turbulence generation, in contradiction to observations. Searching
for possible instabilities leading to the turbulization of gas-dynamic disks is
one of the challenging astrophysical problems. In 2004, we showed that in
accretion disks in binary stars the so-called precessional density wave forms
and induces additional density and velocity gradients in the disk. Linear
analysis of the fluid instability of an accretion disk in a binary system
revealed that the presence of the precessional wave in the disk due to tidal
interaction with the binary companion gives rise to instability of radial modes
with the characteristic growth time of tenths and hundredths of the binary
orbital period. The radial velocity gradient in the precessional wave is shown
to be responsible for the instability. A perturbation becomes unstable if the
velocity variation the perturbation wavelength scale is about or higher than
the sound speed. Unstable perturbations arise in the inner part of the disk
and, by propagating towards its outer edge, lead to the disk turbulence with
parameters corresponding to observations (the Shakura-Sunyaev parameter $\alpha

the latter enables to deal with physical parameters that cannot be observed or,
more generally, with data contaminated by experimental artifacts that cannot be
explained with noise models. Secondly, spatial constraints are introduced in
the model through a Markov random field (MRF) prior which provides a spatial
structure to the Gaussian-mixture hidden variables. Experiments conducted on a
database composed of remotely sensed observations collected from the Mars
planet by the Mars Express orbiter demonstrate the effectiveness of the
proposed model.

$A$ of crypto-protocols reduces to protocol class $B$ in a scenario $X$, if for
every instance $a$ of $A$, there is an instance $b$ of $B$ and a secure
transformation $X$ that reproduces $a$ given $b$, such that the security of $b$
guarantees the security of $a$. Here we employ this reductive framework to
study the relationship between security in quantum key distribution (QKD) and
quantum secure direct communication (QSDC). We show that replacing the
streaming of independent qubits in a QKD scheme by block encoding and
transmission (permuting the order of particles block by block) of qubits, we
can construct a QSDC scheme. This forms the basis for the \textit{block
reduction} from a QSDC class of protocols to a QKD class of protocols, whereby
if the latter is secure, then so is the former. Conversely, given a secure QSDC
protocol, we can of course construct a secure QKD scheme by transmitting a
random key as the direct message. Then the QKD class of protocols is secure,
assuming the security of the QSDC class which it is built from. We refer to
this method of deduction of security for this class of QKD protocols, as
\textit{key reduction}. Finally, we propose an orthogonal-state-based
deterministic key distribution (KD) protocol which is secure in some local
post-quantum theories. Its security arises neither from geographic splitting of
a code state nor from Heisenberg uncertainty, but from post-measurement
disturbance.

full nonequilirbium mixed state density matrix of the whole system is written

pressure and temperature. It consists of two steps. At first, the
potential-energy surface is scanned by means of a global-optimization
technique, i.e., a massive-parallel first-principles cascade genetic algorithm

methods. In particular, we validate a) the criteria for selection and
combination of structures used for the assemblage of new candidate structures,
and b) the choice of the exchange-correlation functional. The selection
criteria are validated against a fully unbiased method: replica-exchange
molecular dynamics. Our choice of the exchange-correlation functional, the
van-der-Waals-corrected PBE0 hybrid functional, is justified by comparisons up
to highest level currently achievable within density-functional theory, i.e.,
the renormalized second-order perturbation theory, rPT2. In the second step,
the low-energy structures are analyzed by means of ab initio atomistic
thermodynamics in order to determine compositions and structures that minimize
the Gibbs free energy at given temperature and pressure of the reactive

over the time spent at the POI. With limited time budget, the robot must
balance between spending time traveling to POIs and spending time at POIs for

Alternatively, the robot may be required to acquire a minimum mount of reward

$p$-harmonic maps between Riemannian manifolds. The aim is obtaining
Minkowski-type volume estimates on the singular set $S(f)=\{x \ \ s.t. \ \ f
\text{ is not continuous at } x\}$, as opposed to the weaker and non
quantitative Hausdorff dimension bounds currently available in literature for
generic $p$.
  The main technique used in this paper is the quantitative stratification,
which is based on the study of the approximate symmetries of the tangent maps
of $f$. In this article, we generalize the study carried out in \cite{ChNa2}
for minimizing $2$-harmonic maps to generic $p\in (1,\infty)$. Moreover, we
analyze also the stationary case where the lack of compactness makes the study
more complicated.
  In order to understand the degeneracy intrinsic in the behaviour of
stationary maps, we study the defect measure naturally associated to a sequence
of such maps and generalize the results obtained in \cite{lin_stat}.
  By using refined covering arguments, we also improve the estimates in the
case of isolated singularities and obtain a definite bound on the number of
singular points. This result seems to be new even for minimizing $2$-harmonic
maps.

The opposite sign for emission from different valleys demonstrates lifting of
the valley degeneracy. The magnitude of the Zeeman shift agrees with predicted
magnetic moments for carriers in the conduction and valence bands. The relative
intensity of neutral and charged exciton emission is modified by the magnetic
field, reflecting the creation of field-induced valley polarization. At high

In some situations this assumption is not feasible as every unit in the
population has been observed, potentially leading to over-covered population
estimates. We simplify the existing pooling rules for situations where the
sampling variance is not of interest. We compare these rules to the
conventional pooling rules and demonstrate their use in a situation where there
is no sampling variance. Using the standard pooling rules in situations where
sampling variance should not be considered, leads to overestimation of the
variance of the estimates of interest, especially when the amount of
missingness is not very large. As a result, populations estimates are
over-covered, which may lead to a loss of statistical power. We conclude that
the theory of multiple imputation can be extended to the situation where the
sample happens to be the population. The simplified pooling rules can be easily
implemented to obtain valid inference in cases where we have observed
essentially all units and in simulation studies addressing the missingness
mechanism only.

two-dimensional turbulence in a magnetohydrodynamic flow with a maximally
simple configuration: plane, noninflectional (with a constant shear of
velocity) and threaded by a parallel uniform background magnetic field. This
flow is spectrally stable, so the turbulence is subcritical by nature and hence
it can be energetically supported just by transient growth mechanism due to
shear flow nonnormality. This mechanism appears to be essentially anisotropic
in spectral (wavenumber) plane and operates mainly for spatial Fourier
harmonics with streamwise wavenumbers less than a ratio of flow shear to the
Alfv\'{e}n speed, $k_y < S/u_A$ (i.e., the Alfv\'{e}n frequency is lower than
the shear rate). We focused on the analysis of the character of nonlinear
processes and underlying self-sustaining scheme of the turbulence, i.e., on the
interplay between linear transient growth and nonlinear processes, in spectral
plane. Our study, being concerned with a new type of the energy-injecting
process for turbulence -- the transient growth, represents an alternative to
the main trends of MHD turbulence research. We find similarity of the nonlinear
dynamics to the related dynamics in hydrodynamic flows -- to the \emph{bypass}
concept of subcritical turbulence. The essence of the analyzed nonlinear MHD
processes appears to be a transverse redistribution of kinetic and magnetic
spectral energies in wavenumber plane [as occurs in the related hydrodynamic
flow, see Horton et al., Phys. Rev. E {\bf 81}, 066304 (2010)] and differs
fundamentally from the existing concepts of (anisotropic direct and inverse)

  Miss-Specification",,,,,"stat.ME","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Linear regression is a frequently used tool in statistics, however, its
validity and interpretability relies on strong model assumptions. While robust
estimates of the coefficients' covariance extend the validity of hypothesis
tests and confidence intervals, a clear interpretation of the coefficients is
lacking if the mean structure of the model is miss-specified. We therefore
suggest a new intuitive and mathematical rigorous interpretation of the
coefficients that is independent from specific model assumptions. It relies on
a new population based measure of association. The idea is to quantify how much
the population mean of the dependent variable Y can be changed by changing the
distribution of the independent variable X. Restriction to linear functions for
the distributional changes in X provides the link to linear regression. It
leads to a conservative approximation of the newly defined and generally
non-linear measure of association. The conservative linear approximation can
then be estimated by linear regression. We show how this interpretation can be
extended to multiple regression and how far and in which sense it leads to an
adjustment for confounding. We point to perspectives for new analysis
strategies and illustrate the utility and limitations of the new interpretation
and strategies by examples and simulations.

significant eccentricity in any of the systems, while the accuracy of our data
does not rule out possible moderate eccentricities. The four objects were first

deep learning algorithms to investigate a data-driven parameterization
technique that is designed for the specific requirements of synthesis. We
create an invertible, low-dimensional, noise-robust encoding of the Mel Log
Spectrum by training a tapered Stacked Denoising Autoencoder (SDA). This SDA is
then unwrapped and used as the initialization for a Multi-Layer Perceptron
(MLP). The MLP is fine-tuned by training it to reconstruct the input at the
output layer. This MLP is then split down the middle to form encoding and
decoding networks. These networks produce a parameterization of the Mel Log
Spectrum that is intended to better fulfill the requirements of synthesis.
Results are reported for experiments conducted using this resulting
parameterization with the ClusterGen speech synthesizer.

Strong correlations also suppress the charge transport through cuprate grain
boundaries (GBs). The question then arises if these correlations can produce
magnetic states at cuprate GBs. We analyze the formation of local magnetic
moments at the GB of a correlated two-dimensional electron systems which is
represented by an inhomogeneous Hubbard model. The model Hamiltonian is
diagonalized after the implementation of a mean-field decoupling. The formation
of local magnetic moments is supported by a sufficiently strong variance in the
bond kinetic energies at the GB. Local scattering potentials can assist or
suppress the formation of a magnetic GB state, depending on the details of
their spacial distribution. Grain boundary induced stripes are formed in the
vicinity the GB and decay into the bulk. Moreover, we observe the build-up of
conducting channels which are confined by magnetic clusters. The grain boundary
resistance increases at decreasing temperatures. This low-temperature behavior
is caused by the suppression of current correlations in the state with local
magnetic GB moments. The resistance upturn at low temperatures is in
qualitative agreement with experiments.

0.75<z<1.55 high-z sample (1700 SNe). The nearby and intermediate surveys are
assumed to be conducted from the ground, while the high-z is a joint ground-
and space-based survey. This latter survey, the ""Dark Energy Supernova

observing time, with a dedicated observing program. We simulate the SN events
as they would be observed in rolling-search mode by the various instruments,
and derive the quality of expected cosmological constraints. We account for
known systematic uncertainties, in particular calibration uncertainties
including their contribution through the training of the supernova model used
to fit the supernovae light curves. Using conservative assumptions and a 1-D
geometric Planck prior, we find that the ensemble of surveys would yield
competitive constraints: a constant equation of state parameter can be
constrained to sigma(w)=0.022, and a Dark Energy Task Force figure of merit of
203 is found for a two-parameter equation of state. Our simulations thus
indicate that Euclid can bring a significant contribution to a purely

computations (STELLA). STELLA provides both an OpenMP and a CUDA backend for a
shared memory parallelization, using the CPU or GPU inside a node for the
spatial stencils. Here, we intertwine this node-wise spatial parallelism with
the time-parallel Parareal. This is done by adding an MPI-based implementation
of Parareal, which allows us to parallelize in time across nodes. The
performance of Parareal with both backends is analyzed in terms of speedup,
parallel efficiency and energy-to-solution for an advection-diffusion problem
with a time-dependent diffusion coefficient.

predicting free induction decays (FIDs) measured by solid-state nuclear
magnetic resonance (NMR) on systems of quantum nuclear spins. The specific
limits considered are associated with the range of interaction, the size of
individual quantum spins and the long-time behavior of the FID signals. We
compare FIDs measured or computed for lattices of quantum spins (mainly spins
1/2) with the FIDs computed for the corresponding lattices of classical spins.
Several cases of excellent quantitative agreement between quantum and classical
FIDs are reported along with the cases of gradually decreasing quality of the
agreement. We formulate semi-empirical criteria defining the situations, when
classical simulations are expected to accurately reproduce quantum FIDs. Our
findings indicate that classical simulations may be a quantitatively accurate
tool of first principles calculations for a broad class of macroscopic systems,
where individual quantum microscopic degrees of freedom are far from the
classical limit.

relationship between two sets of variables. It has important applications in
analyzing high dimensional datasets originated from genomics, imaging and other
fields. This paper considers adaptive minimax and computationally tractable
estimation of leading sparse canonical coefficient vectors in high dimensions.
First, we establish separate minimax estimation rates for canonical coefficient
vectors of each set of random variables under no structural assumption on
marginal covariance matrices. Second, we propose a computationally feasible
estimator to attain the optimal rates adaptively under an additional sample
size condition. Finally, we show that a sample size condition of this kind is
needed for any randomized polynomial-time estimator to be consistent, assuming
hardness of certain instances of the Planted Clique detection problem. The
result is faithful to the Gaussian models used in the paper. As a byproduct, we
obtain the first computational lower bounds for sparse PCA under the Gaussian
single spiked covariance model.

Furthermore, we more than doubled our original data set from 2008 by acquiring
six months of additional data in 2013. Both the new data set and a re-analysis
of the older data are in good agreement. Scattering lengths of low Z isotopes
are valued for use in few-body nuclear effective field theories, provide
important tests of modern nuclear potential models and in the case of $^3$He
aid in the interpretation of neutron scattering from quantum liquids. The
difference $\Delta b^{\prime}$ was determined by measuring the relative phase
shift between two incident neutron polarizations caused by the spin-dependent
interaction with a polarized $^3$He target. The target $^3$He gas was sealed
inside a small, flat windowed glass cell that was placed in one beam path of
the interferometer. The relaxation of $^3$He polarization was monitored
continuously with neutron transmission measurements. The neutron polarization
and spin flipper efficiency were determined separately using $^3$He analyzers
and two different polarimetry analysis methods. A summary of the measured
scattering lengths for n-$^3$He with a comparison to nucleon interaction models

obtaining bounds on the number of eigenvalues of $L$ in subsets of the
complement of the essential spectrum of $L_0$, in terms of the approximation
numbers of the perturbing operator $K$. Our results can be considered as wide
generalizations of classical results on the distribution of eigenvalues of
compact operators, which correspond to the case $L_0=0$. They also extend
previous results on operators in Hilbert space. Our method employs complex
analysis and a new finite-dimensional reduction, allowing us to avoid using the
existing theory of determinants in Banach spaces, which would require strong
restrictions on $K$. Several open questions regarding the sharpness of our

Linewidth measurements reveal that the lifetime of the magnons is asymmetric
with respect to their counter-propagating directions. The lifetime asymmetry is
dependent on the magnon frequency, being more pronounced the higher the

exoplanets has been done over the last decade. The research is driven by the
prospect of characterizing habitable planets beyond the Solar System in the
near future. In this work, I present a method to produce the disk-integrated
signature of planets that are described in their three-dimensional complexity,
i.e. with both horizontal and vertical variations in the optical properties of
their envelopes. The approach is based on pre-conditioned backward Monte Carlo
integration of the vector Radiative Transport Equation and yields the full
Stokes vector for outgoing reflected radiation. The method is demonstrated
through selected examples inspired by published work at wavelengths from the
visible to the near infrared and terrestrial prescriptions of both cloud and
surface albedo maps. A clear advantage of this approach is that its
computational cost does not appear to be significantly affected by
non-uniformities in the planet optical properties. Earth's simulated appearance
is strongly dependent on wavelength; both brightness and polarisation undergo
diurnal variations arising from changes in the planet cover, but polarisation
yields a better insight into variations with phase angle. There is partial
cancellation of the polarised signal from the northern and southern hemispheres
so that the outgoing polarisation vector lies preferentially either in the
plane parallel or perpendicular to the planet scattering plane, also for
non-uniform cloud and albedo properties and various levels of absorption within
the atmosphere. The evaluation of circular polarisation is challenging; a
number of one-photon experiments of 1E9 or more is needed to resolve
hemispherically-integrated degrees of circular polarisation of a few times
1E-5. Last, I introduce brightness curves...

colors arising from short-ranged spatial correlations between scattering
centers. Unlike the structural colors arising from Bragg diffraction in ordered
materials like opals, the colors of these photonic glasses are independent of
orientation, owing to their disordered, isotropic microstructures. However,
there are few examples of photonic glasses with angle-independent red colors in
nature, and colloidal glasses with particle sizes chosen to yield structural
colors in the red show weak color saturation. Using scattering theory, we show
that the absence of angle-independent red color can be explained by the
tendency of individual particles to backscatter light more strongly in the
blue. We discuss how the backscattering resonances of individual particles
arise from cavity-like modes, and how they interact with the structural
resonances to prevent red. Finally, we use the model to develop design rules
for colloidal glasses with red, angle-independent structural colors.

setting for a complete treatment of localized data corruptions due to severe
noise sources, e.g., an occluder in the case of a visual recording. Within this
framework, we propose i) a novel algorithm to efficiently separate, i.e.,
detect and localize, possible corruptions from a given suspicious data instance
and ii) a Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) estimator to impute the corrupted data. As
a generalization to Euclidean distance, we also propose a novel distance
measure, which is based on the ranked deviations among the data attributes and
empirically shown to be superior in separating the corruptions. Our algorithm
first splits the suspicious instance into parts through a binary partitioning
tree in the space of data attributes and iteratively tests those parts to
detect local anomalies using the nominal statistics extracted from an
uncorrupted (clean) reference data set. Once each part is labeled as anomalous
vs normal, the corresponding binary patterns over this tree that characterize
corruptions are identified and the affected attributes are imputed. Under a
certain conditional independency structure assumed for the binary patterns, we
analytically show that the false alarm rate of the introduced algorithm in
detecting the corruptions is independent of the data and can be directly set
without any parameter tuning. The proposed framework is tested over several
well-known machine learning data sets with synthetically generated corruptions;
and experimentally shown to produce remarkable improvements in terms of
classification purposes with strong corruption separation capabilities. Our
experiments also indicate that the proposed algorithms outperform the typical
approaches and are robust to varying training phase conditions.

religious leaders and organizations as well as believers start using social

extensions to traditional religious rituals and practices. However, there has
been lack of research on religiosity in online social networks. This paper
takes a step toward the understanding of several important aspects of
religiosity on Twitter, based on the analysis of more than 250k U.S. users who
self-declared their religions/belief, including Atheism, Buddhism,
Christianity, Hinduism, Islam, and Judaism. Specifically, (i) we examine the
correlation of geographic distribution of religious people between Twitter and
offline surveys. (ii) We analyze users' tweets and networks to identify
discriminative features of each religious group, and explore supervised methods
to identify believers of different religions. (iii) We study the linkage
preference of different religious groups, and observe a strong preference of
Twitter users connecting to others sharing the same religion.

tethered to multidimensional parameter estimation under linear measurement
models. In particular, the considered confidence regions are non-asymptotic,
this meaning that the number of required measurements is finite. Distributed
solutions for the computation of non-asymptotic confidence regions are
proposed, suited to wireless sensor networks scenarios. Their performances are
compared in terms of required traffic load, both analytically and numerically.
The evidence emerging from the conducted investigations is that the best
solution for information exchange depends on whether the network topology is
structured or unstructured. The effect on the computation of confidence regions
of information diffusion truncation is also examined. In particular, it is
proven that consistent confidence regions can be computed even when an
incomplete set of measurements is available.

integrated luminosity of 3.0 fb$^{-1}$, recorded by the LHCb experiment.
Semileptonic $B^0$ decays are reconstructed in the inclusive final states
$D^-\mu^+$ and $D^{*-}\mu^+$, where the $D^-$ meson decays into the
$K^+\pi^-\pi^-$ final state, and the $D^{*-}$ meson into the
$\overline{D}{}^0(\rightarrow K^+\pi^-)\pi^-$ final state. The asymmetry
between the numbers of $D^{(*)-}\mu^+$ and $D^{(*)+}\mu^-$ decays is measured
as a function of the decay time of the $B^0$ mesons. The $CP$ asymmetry is
measured to be $a_{\rm sl}^d = (-0.02 \pm 0.19 \pm 0.30)\%$, where the first
uncertainty is statistical and the second systematic. This is the most precise
measurement of $a_{\rm sl}^d$ to date and is consistent with the prediction
from the Standard Model.

negatively assorted with respect to the correlation between their degrees. This
feature would play an important 'damping' role in the market during downturns

chances of auto-amplifying (the propagation of) distress. In this paper we
explore a trade-network of industrial firms where the nodes are suppliers or
buyers, and the links are those invoices that the suppliers send out to their
buyers and then go on to present to their bank for discounting. The network was
collected by a large Italian bank in 2007, from their intermediation of the
sales on credit made by their clients. The network also shows dissortative
behavior as seen in other studies on financial networks. However, when looking
at the credit rating of the firms, an important attribute internal to each
node, we find that firms that trade with one another share overwhelming
similarity. We know that much data is missing from our data set. However, we
can quantify the amount of missing data using information exposure, a variable
that connects social structure and behavior. This variable is a ratio of the
sales invoices that a supplier presents to their bank over their total sales.
Results reveal a non-trivial and robust relationship between the information
exposure and credit rating of a firm, indicating the influence of the neighbors
on a firm's rating. This methodology provides a new insight into how to
reconstruct a network suffering from incomplete information.

probability of constraint violation in case the probability distribution of
uncertain parameters are completely defined by using first and second-order
probability moments. An attractive aspect of our method is that it decomposes
the second-order cone programming problem, associated with the robust
counterpart, into a linear master problem and different quadratically
constrained problems (QCP) of considerable lower size. The optimal solution is
achieved through the solution of these master and subproblems within an
iterative scheme based on cutting plane approximations of the second-order cone
constraints. In addition, proof of convergence of the iterative method is

nested data structure arising from the assignment of treatment, in a non-random
manner, to groups or clusters of units or individuals. Examples are ubiquitous
in the health and social sciences including patients in hospitals, employees in
firms, and students in schools. What is the optimal matching strategy in a
clustered observational study? At first thought, one might start by matching
clusters of individuals and then, within matched clusters, continue by matching
individuals. But as we discuss in this paper, the optimal strategy is the
opposite: in typical applications, where the intracluster correlation is not
perfect, it is best to first match individuals and, once all possible
combinations of matched individuals are known, then match clusters. In this
paper we use dynamic and integer programming to implement this strategy and
extend optimal matching methods to hierarchical and multilevel settings. Among
other matched designs, our strategy can approximate a paired clustered
randomized study by finding the largest sample of matched pairs of treated and
control individuals within matched pairs of treated and control clusters that
is balanced according to specifications given by the investigator. This
strategy directly balances covariates both at the cluster and individual levels
and does not require estimating the propensity score, although the propensity
score can be balanced as an additional covariate. We illustrate our results
with a case study of the comparative effectiveness of public versus private
voucher schools in Chile, a question of intense policy debate in the country at
the present.

Interestingly, identifying the fastest implementation -- without executing it

of tuning each routine to performance-optimal configurations. Indeed, the

algorithmic parameters for maximum performance; in both cases, we do not
execute the algorithms themselves. Instead, our methodology relies on timing

typically with a delay of one raster (75 seconds) and sometimes offset by up to

ribbons, suggesting hot plasma upflow into the corona. The Fe XXI ribbon
emission is compact with a spatial extent of $< 2^{\prime\prime}$, and can
extend beyond the chromospheric ribbon locations. Examples are found of both
decreasing and increasing blue-shift in the direction away from the ribbon
locations, and blue-shifts were present for at least 6 minutes after the flare
peak. The post-flare loop arcade, seen in Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA)
131 \AA\ filtergram images that are dominated by Fe XXI, exhibited bright

are resolved by IRIS at $\ge 1^{\prime\prime}$, and line widths in the

networks. Agents receive private signals about an unknown state of the world.
The underlying state is globally identifiable, yet informative signals may be
dispersed throughout the network. Using an optimization-based framework, we
develop an iterative local strategy for updating individual beliefs. In
contrast to the existing literature which focuses on asymptotic learning, we
provide a finite-time analysis. Furthermore, we introduce a Kullback-Leibler
cost to compare the efficiency of the algorithm to its centralized counterpart.
Our bounds on the cost are expressed in terms of network size, spectral gap,
centrality of each agent and relative entropy of agents' signal structures. A
key observation is that distributing more informative signals to central agents
results in a faster learning rate. Furthermore, optimizing the weights, we can
speed up learning by improving the spectral gap. We also quantify the effect of
link failures on learning speed in symmetric networks. We finally provide
numerical simulations which verify our theoretical results.

of this paper is a systematic methodology to accurately identify the fastest

accomplished with the help of a set of cache-aware micro-benchmarks for the

aims to alleviate the human cost required to manually annotate collections of
recorded music with textual labels by automating the process. Many autotagging
systems have been proposed and evaluated by procedures and datasets that are
now standard (used in MIREX, for instance). Very little work, however, has been
dedicated to determine what these evaluations really mean about an autotagging
system, or the comparison of two systems, for the problem of annotating music
in the real world. In this article, we are concerned with explaining the figure
of merit of an autotagging system evaluated with a standard approach.
Specifically, does the figure of merit, or a comparison of figures of merit,
warrant a conclusion about how well autotagging systems have learned to
describe music with a specific vocabulary? The main contributions of this paper
are a formalization of the notion of validity in autotagging evaluation, and a
method to test it in general. We demonstrate the practical use of our method in
experiments with three specific state-of-the-art autotagging systems --all of
which are reproducible using the linked code and data. Our experiments show for
these specific systems in a simple and objective two-class task that the
standard evaluation approach does not provide valid indicators of their
performance.

evolve into synchronous rotators. On these planets, the sub-stellar hemisphere
experiences perpetual daylight while the opposing anti-stellar hemisphere
experiences perpetual darkness. Because the night-side hemisphere has no direct
source of energy, the air over this side of the planet is prone to freeze out
and deposit on the surface, which could result in atmospheric collapse.
However, general circulation models (GCMs) have shown that atmospheric dynamics
can counteract this problem and provide sufficient energy transport to the
anti-stellar side.
  Here we use an idealized GCM to consider the impact of geothermal heating on
the habitability of synchronously rotating planets. Geothermal heating may be
expected due to tidal interactions with the host star, and the effects of
geothermal heating provide additional habitable surface area and may help to
induce melting of ice on the anti-stellar hemisphere. We also explore the
persistence of atmospheric asymmetries between the northern and southern
hemispheres, and we find that the direction of the meridional circulation (for
rapidly rotating planets) or the direction of zonal wind (for slowly rotating
planets) reverses on either side of the sub-stellar point. We show that the
zonal circulation approaches a theoretical state similar to a Walker
circulation only for slowly rotating planets, while rapidly rotating planets
show a zonal circulation with the opposite direction. We find that a
cross-polar circulation is present in all cases and provides an additional
mechanism of mass and energy transport from the sub-stellar to anti-stellar
point. Characterization of the atmospheres of synchronously rotating planets
should include consideration of hemispheric differences in meridional
circulation and examination of transport due to cross-polar flow.

them. The existence of a minimal length and a maximum momentum accuracy is
preferred by various physical observations. Furthermore, assuming modified
dispersion relation allows for a wide range of applications in estimating, for
example, the inflationary parameters, Lorentz invariance violation, black hole
thermodynamics, Saleker-Wigner inequalities, entropic nature of the
gravitational laws, Friedmann equations, minimal time measurement and
thermodynamics of the high-energy collisions. One of the higher-order GUP
approaches gives predictions for the minimal length uncertainty. Another one
predicts a maximum momentum and a minimal length uncertainty, simultaneously.
An extensive comparison between the different GUP approaches is summarized. We
also discuss the GUP impacts on the equivalence principles including the
universality of the gravitational redshift and the free fall and law of
reciprocal action and on the kinetic energy of composite system. The concern
about the compatibility with the equivalence principles, the universality of
gravitational redshift and the free fall and law of reciprocal action should be
addressed. We conclude that the value of the GUP parameters remain a puzzle to
be verified.

exactly two, unique, independent gauge-invariant quantities which describe the
true, physical perturbations to the energy density and particle number density.
Using these two new quantities, evolution equations for cosmological density
perturbations and for entropy perturbations, adapted to non-barotropic
equations of state for the pressure, are derived. Density perturbations evolve
adiabatically if and only if the particle number density does not contribute to
the pressure. Local density perturbations do not affect the global expansion of
the universe. The new perturbation theory has an exact non-relativistic limit
in a non-static universe. The gauge problem of cosmology has thus been solved.

sites, superconductivity is found to be rather robust against the Pt and Ni
dopants on the one-dimensional Pd chains. Most strikingly, the reduced
$H_{c2}$, i.e., the ratio of $H_{c2}/T_c$, is seen to be significantly enhanced
by the heavier Pt doping but suppressed in the Ni-doped counterparts, distinct
from the nearly constant value in the Se doped samples. Our findings therefore
suggest that the upper critical field of this system can be modified in a
tunable fashion by chemical doping on the Pd chains with elements of varying
mass numbers. The spin-orbit coupling on the Pd sites, by inference, should
play an important role in the observed superconductivity and on the large upper
critical field beyond the Pauli pair-breaking field.

homogeneous Universe, has not been clearly explained by the standard version of
inflationary models as the dynamics involved preserve the homogeneity and
isotropy at all times. A proposal that attempts to deal with this problem, by
introducing ""the self-induced collapse hypothesis,"" has been introduced by D.
Sudarsky and collaborators in previous papers. In all these works, the collapse
of the wave function of the inflaton mode is restricted to occur during the
inflationary period. In this paper, we analyse the possibility that the
collapse happens during the radiation era. A viable model can be constructed
under the condition that the inflaton field variable must be affected by the
collapse while the momentum variable can or cannot be affected. Another
condition to be fulfilled is that the time of collapse must be independent of
$k$. However, when comparing with recent observational data, the predictions of
the model cannot be distinguished from the ones provided by the standard
inflationary scenario. The main reason for this arises from the requirement
that primordial power spectrum obtained for the radiation era matches the
amplitude of scalar fluctuations consistent with the latest CMB observations.
This latter constraint results in a limit on the possible times of collapse and
ensures that the contribution of the inflaton field to the energy-momentum
tensor is negligible compared to the contribution of the radiation fields.
