of getting localized massless vector field on the brane is described here. This
is obtained by dimensional reduction of a five dimension massive two form, or
Kalb-Ramond field, giving a Kalb-Ramond and an emergent vector field in four
dimensions. A geometrical coupling with the Ricci scalar is proposed and the
coupling constant is fixed such that the components of the fields are
localized. The solution is obtained by decomposing the fields in transversal
and longitudinal parts and showing that this give decoupled equations of motion
for the transverse vector and KR fields in four dimensions. We also prove some
identities satisfied by the transverse components of the fields. With this is
possible to fix the coupling constant in a way that a localized zero mode for
both components on the brane is obtained. Then, all the above results are
generalized to the massive $p-$form field. It is also shown that in general an
effective $p$ and $(p-1)-$forms can not be localized on the brane and we have
to sort one of them to localize. Therefore, we can not have a vector and a
scalar field localized by dimensional reduction of the five dimensional vector
field. In fact we find the expression $p=(d-1)/2$ which determines what forms
will give rise to both fields localized. For $D=5$, as expected, this is valid
only for the KR field.

leptonic CP phase $\delta_{CP} \sim -90^\circ$ from neutrino data. This is now
corroborated by the NO$\nu$A neutrino runs. We study the implications for
neutrino mass hierarchy and octant of $\theta_{23}$ in the context of this data
assuming that the true value of $\delta_{CP}$ in nature is $-90^\circ$. Based
on simple arguments on degeneracies in the probabilities we show that a clear
signal of $\delta_{CP}=-90^\circ$ coming from T2K neutrino (antineutrino) data
is only possible if the true hierarchy is normal and the true octant is higher
(lower). Thus if the T2K neutrino and antineutrino data are fitted separately
and both give the true value of $\delta_{CP}=-90^\circ$, this will imply that
nature has chosen the true hierarchy to be normal and $\theta_{23} \approx
45^\circ$. However we find that the combined fit of neutrino and antineutrino
data will still point to true hierarchy as normal but the octant of
$\theta_{23}$ will remain undetermined. We do our analysis for both, the
current projected exposure ($7.8 \times 10^{21}$ pot) and planned extended
exposure ($20 \times 10^{21}$ pot). We also present the CP discovery potential
of T2K emphasizing on the role of antineutrinos. We find that one of the main
contribution of the antineutrino data is to remove the degenerate solutions
with the wrong octant. Thus the antineutrino run plays a more significant role
for those hierarchy-octant combinations for which this degeneracy is present.
If this degeneracy is absent, then only neutrino run gives a better result for
fixed $\theta_{13}$. However if we marginalize over $\theta_{13}$ then,
sensitivity corresponding to mixed run can be better than pure neutrino run.

resolution, high signal-to-noise ratio optical spectra collected with the
spectrograph NARVAL on the Telescope Bernard Lyot at Pic du Midi. We
investigate the variability of twelve spectral lines by means of the Temporal
Variance Spectrum (TVS). The selected lines probe the radial structure of the
atmosphere, from the photosphere to the outer wind. We also perform a
spectroscopic analysis with atmosphere models to derive the stellar and wind
properties, and to constrain the formation region of the selected lines. We
show that variability is observed in the wind lines of all bright giants and
supergiants, on a daily timescale. Lines formed in the photosphere are
sometimes variable, sometimes not. The dwarf stars do not show any sign of
variability. If variability is observed on a daily timescale, it can also (but
not always) be observed on hourly timescales, albeit with lower amplitude.
There is a very clear correlation between amplitude of the variability and
fraction of the line formed in the wind. Strong anti-correlations between the
different part of the temporal variance spectrum are observed. Our results
indicate that variability is stronger in lines formed in the wind. A link
between photospheric and wind variability is not obvious from our study, since
wind variability is observed whatever the level of photospheric variability.
Different photospheric lines also show different degrees of variability.

phase separation and focus on several types of unconventional skyrmion-like
topological structures in 2D boson systems, which have not been analysed till

To this purpose, we construct the most simple meta-GGA by expressing the local
exchange-correlation energy per particle as a function of a fictitious density,
which is obtained by inverting the Thomas-Fermi kinetic-energy functional. This
simple functional considerably improves the total energy of atoms as compared
to the standard local density approximation. The corresponding
exchange-correlation potentials are then determined exactly through a solution
of the optimized effective potential equation. These potentials support an
additional bound state and exhibit a derivative discontinuity at integer
particle numbers. We further demonstrate that through the kinetic-energy
density any meta-GGA incorporates a derivative discontinuity. However, we also
find that for commonly used meta-GGAs the discontinuity is largely
underestimated and in some cases even negative.

but the former is easier to measure at higher temperatures and the latter at
lower temperatures. But even after using both methods together, the range of
increase in the observed lengthscales was limited by the relaxation times
reachable by standard molecular dynamics techniques (i.e. about 4-5 orders of
magnitude). In this paper we therefore attempt to explore the typical scale at
even lower temperatures, testing for this purpose two approaches, one based on
the idea of vapor deposition and the other on a swap Monte Carlo technique. We
conclude that the first approach does not help in getting to lower
temperatures, but the second one does so quite effectively. We can reach a
typical lengthscale that grows in accordance with at least $15$ orders of
magnitude increase in the relaxation time, competing with the best experimental

The colour separation between the C- and M-type components of the AGB

these tests the new equations reproduce the results of MIS theory when

knots and virtual knot cobordisms which directly applies to classical knot and
classical knot cobordisms. To do so, we give an alternate formulation for the
Manturov definition of Khovanov homology for virtual knots and links with
arbitrary coefficients. This approach uses cut loci on the knot diagram to
induce a conjugation operator in the Frobenius algebra. We then discuss the
implications of the maps induced in the aforementioned theory to the universal
Frobenius algebra for virtual knots. Next we show how one can apply the Karoubi
envelope approach of Bar-Natan and Morrison on abstract link diagrams with
cross cuts to construct the canonical generators of the Khovanov-Lee homology.
Using these canonical generators we derive a generalization of the Rasmussen
invariant for virtual knot cobordisms and furthermore generalize Rasmussen's
result on the slice genus for positive knots to the case of positive virtual
knots. It should also be noted that this generalization of the Rasmussen
invariant provides an easy to compute obstruction to knot cobordisms in $S_g

cometary origin. Furthermore, there are significant variations between the

and a detection operator combine via the ""trace rule"" to generate the
probability of a measurable event. As used to describe experiments, both
density operators and detection operators depend on parameters expressing
experimental choices, so the probabilities they generate also depend on these
parameters. The trace rule answers the question: ""what parametrized
probabilities are generated by a given parametrized density operator and given
parametrized detection operator?""
  Recognizing that the accessibility of operators to experimental tests is only
indirect, via probabilities, we ask what probabilities tell about operators,
or, put more precisely: ""what combinations of a parametrized density operator

  We show that any parametrized probability measure can be explained by many
inequivalent models expressed by density operators and detection operators. so
that a parametrized probability measure, detached from any of the (infinitely
many) parametrized operators that generate it, becomes an interesting object in
its own right. By detaching a parametrized probability measure from the
operators that may have led us to it, we (1) strengthen Holevo's bound on a
quantum communication channel and (2) clarify a role for multiple levels of
modeling in an example based on quantum key distribution. We then inquire into
some parametrized probability measures generated by entangled states and into
the topology of the associated parameter spaces; in particular we display some
previously overlooked topological features of level sets of these probability
measures.

the effects of assumed atmospheric composition and rotation rate on global
scale winds and thermal patterns. We compare and contrast atmospheric models
for HAT-P-2b, which assume one and five times solar metallicity, both with and
without TiO/VO as atmospheric constituents. Additionally we compare models that
assume a rotation period of half, one, and two times the nominal
pseudo-synchronous rotation period. We find that changes in assumed atmospheric
metallicity and rotation rate do not significantly affect model predictions of
the planetary flux as a function of orbital phase. However, models in which
TiO/VO are present in the atmosphere develop a transient temperature inversion
between the transit and secondary eclipse events that results in significant
variations in the timing and magnitude of the peak of the planetary flux
compared with models in which TiO/VO are omitted from the opacity tables. We
find that no one single atmospheric model can reproduce the recently observed
full orbit phase curves at 3.6, 4.5 and 8.0 microns, which is likely due to a
chemical process not captured by our current atmospheric models for HAT-P-2b.
Further modeling and observational efforts focused on understanding the

calculated also for the case where initially both sites are occupied provided
that the difference in occupation is sufficiently large. It provides an
analytical description of results that were so far found only numerically.
Similar behavior and analysis are expected for a large variety of physical
situations in optics, atom optics and quantum dynamics of electrons in Rydberg
atoms.

"1409.5116","Luke Postle","Luke Postle","Characterizing 4-Critical Graphs of Ore-Degree at most Seven","35 pages",,,,"math.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Dirac introduced the notion of a k-critical graph, a graph that is not
(k-1)-colorable but whose every proper subgraph is (k-1)-colorable. Brook's
Theorem states that every graph with maximum degree k is k-colorable unless it
contains a subgraph isomorphic to K_{k+1} (or an odd cycle for k=2).
Equivalently, for all k>=4, the only k-critical graph of maximum degree k-1 is
K_k. A natural generalization of Brook's theorem is to consider the Ore-degree
of a graph, which is the maximum of d(u)+d(v) over all edges uv. Kierstead and
Kostochka proved that for all k>=6 the only k-critical graph with Ore-degree at
most 2k-1 is K_k. Kostochka, Rabern and Steibitz proved that the only
5-critical graphs with Ore-degree at most 9 are K_5 and a graph they called
O_5.
  A different generalization of Brook's theorem, motivated by Hajos'
construction, is Gallai's conjectured bound on the minimum density of a
k-critical graph. Recently, Kostochka and Yancey proved Gallai's conjecture.
Their proof for k>=5 implies the above results on Ore-degree. However, the case
for k=4 remains open, which is the subject of this paper.
  Kostochka and Yancey's short but beautiful proof for the case k=4 says that
if $G$ is a $4$-critical graph, then |E(G)|>= (5|V(G)|-2)/3. We prove the
following bound which is better when there exists a large independent set of
degree three vertices: if G is a 4-critical graph G, then |E(G)|>= 1.6 |V(G)| +
.2 alpha(D_3(G)) - .6, where D_3(G) is the graph induced by the degree three
vertices of G. As a corollary, we characterize the 4-critical graphs with
Ore-degree at most seven as precisely the graphs of Ore-degree seven in the
family of graphs obtained from K_4 and Ore compositions.

of the small-scale magnetic field within the existing magnetic field model of

small-scale component. Using a magnetic-field power spectrum with Gaussian
random fields, the NE2001 model for the thermal electrons and the Galactic
cosmic-ray electron distribution from the current GALPROP model we derive
full-sky maps for the total and polarized synchrotron intensity as well as the
Faraday rotation-measure distribution. While previous work assumed that
small-scale fluctuations average out along the line-of-sight or which only
computed ensemble averages of random fields, we show that these fluctuations
need to be carefully taken into account. Comparing with observational data we
obtain not only good agreement with 408 MHz total and WMAP7 22 GHz polarized
intensity emission maps, but also an improved agreement with Galactic
foreground rotation-measure maps and power spectra, whose amplitude and shape
strongly depend on the parameters of the random field. We demonstrate that a
correlation length of ~220pc (50pc being a 5\sigma lower limit) is needed to
match the slope of the observed power spectrum of Galactic foreground
rotation-measure maps. Using multiple realizations allows us also to infer
errors on individual observables. We find that previously-used amplitudes for
random and anisotropic random magnetic field components need to be rescaled by
factors of ~0.3 and 0.6 to account for the new small-scale contributions. Our
model predicts a rotation measure of -2.8\pm7.1 rad/m^2 and 4.4\pm11.0 rad/m^2
for the north and south Galactic poles respectively, in good agreement with
observations. Applying our model to deflections of ultra-high-energy cosmic

(MBHs) in galactic nuclei. Two formation scenarios were suggested for their
origin: (1) Build-up of NSCs from consecutive infall of stellar cluster and (2)
Continuous in-situ star-formation. Though the cluster-infall scenario has been
extensively studied in recent years, the in-situ formation scenario have been
hardly explored. Here we use Fokker-Planck (FP) calculations to study the
effects of star formation on the build-up of NSCs and its implications for
their long term evolution and their resulting structure. We use the FP equation
to describe the evolution of several stellar populations, and add appropriate
source terms to account for the effects of newly formed stars. We show that
continuous star-formation even 1-2 pc away from the MBH can lead to the
build-up of an NSC with properties similar to those of the Milky-way NSC. We
also find that the general structure of the old stellar population in the NSC
with in-situ star-formation could be very similar to the steady-state
Bahcall-Wolf cuspy structure. However, its younger stellar population do not
yet achieve a steady state. In particular, formed/evolved NSCs with in-situ
star-formation contain differential age-segregated stellar populations which
are not yet fully mixed. Younger stellar populations formed in the outer
regions of the NSC have a cuspy structure towards the NSC outskirts, while
showing a core-like distribution inwards; with younger populations having
larger core sizes. In principal, such a structure can give rise to an apparent
core-like radial distribution of younger (up to 2-3 Gyrs) stars, as observed in
the Galactic center. Such an NSC still preserves an underlying stellar cusp of
older stars, that can be potentially be missed by current observations of
red-giants.

disturbance (as measured by visual signatures of interactions and clumpy

as inactive galaxies, but display a red central light enhancement, which may
arise due to a more pronounced bulge in AGN hosts or due to extinguished
nuclear light. We undertake a number of tests of these alternatives, but our

values of the superpartner mass scale $\tilde{m}$ for LSP thermal relics. In
theories with independent scanning of multiple DM components, there is a high

independent scanning of $f$ and $\tilde{m}$, TeV-scale LSP DM and an axion
solution to the strong CP problem are unlikely to coexist. With thermal LSP DM,
the scheme allows an understanding of a Little SUSY Hierarchy with multi-TeV
superpartners. Alternatively, with axion DM, PQ breaking before (after)
inflation leads to $f$ typically below (below) the projected range of the
current ADMX experiment of $f = (3 - 30) \times 10^{11}$ GeV, providing strong
motivation to develop experimental techniques for probing lower $f$.

strong shocks inside the cavity, and radiated away. Following the merger, the
cavity refills viscously and the accretion rate relaxes to the Shakura-Sunyaev

merger simulations from the GalMer database that give rise to realistic,
relaxed E/S0 and S0 remnants (67 major and 29 minor mergers). We simulate
surface brightness profiles of these S0-like remnants in the K-band, mimicking
typical observational conditions, to perform bulge-disc decompositions
analogous to those carried out in real S0s. The global bulge-disc structure of
these remnants has been compared with real data, and they distribute in the B/T
- r_e - h_d parameter space consistently with real bright S0s, where B/T is the
bulge-to-total luminosity ratio, r_e is the bulge effective radius, and h_d is
the disc scalelength. Major mergers can rebuild a bulge-disc coupling in the
remnants after having destroyed the structures of the progenitors, whereas
minor mergers directly preserve them. Remnants exhibit B/T and r_e/h_d spanning
a wide range of values, and their distribution is consistent with observations.
Many remnants have bulge Sersic indices ranging 1<n<2, flat appearance, and
contain residual star formation in embedded discs, a result which agrees with
the presence of pseudobulges in real S0s. Contrary to the popular view, mergers
(and in particular, major events) can result in S0 remnants with realistically
coupled bulge-disc structures in less than ~3 Gyr. In conclusion, the
bulge-disc coupling and the presence of pseudobulges in real S0s cannot be used
as an argument against the possible major-merger origin of these galaxies.

lower than ever seen in WDs. We consider various explanations: WD rotation
combined with magnetic cool spots; rotation combined with magnetic dichroism;
rotation combined with hot spots from an interstellar-medium accretion flow;
transits by size ~50 - 200 km objects; relativistic beaming due to reflex
motion caused by a cool companion WD; or reflection/re-radiation of the primary
WD light by a brown-dwarf or giant-planet companion, undergoing illumination
phases as it orbits the WD. Each mechanism could be behind some of the variable
WDs, but could not be responsible for all five to seven variable cases.
Alternatively, the periodicity may arise from UV metal-line opacity, associated
with accretion of rocky material, a phenomenon seen in ~50% of hot WDs.
Non-uniform UV opacity, combined with WD rotation and fluorescent optical
re-emission of the absorbed UV energy, could perhaps explain our findings. Even
if reflection by a planet is the cause in only a few of the seven cases, it
would imply that hot Jupiters are very common around WDs. If some of the
rotation-related mechanisms are at work, then normal WDs rotate as slowly as do
peculiar WDs, the only kind for which precise rotation measurements have been
possible to date. Followup observations for this sample, and the larger numbers

three different sets of non-Gaussian statistics of the lensing convergence
field: Minkowski functionals (MF), low--order moments (LM), and peak counts

from the PS than in previous work. (ii) The PS and LM yield biases much smaller
than the morphological statistics (MF, PK). (iii) For strictly Gaussian
spurious shear with integrated amplitude as low as its current estimate of
$\sigma^2_{sys}\approx 10^{-7}$, biases from the PS and LM would be unimportant
even for a survey with the statistical power of LSST. However, we find that for
surveys larger than $\approx 100$ deg$^2$, non-Gaussianity in the noise (not
included in our analysis) will likely be important and must be quantified to
assess the biases. (iv) The morphological statistics (MF,PK) introduce
important biases even for Gaussian noise, which must be corrected in large
surveys. The biases are in different directions in $(\Omega_m,w,\sigma_8)$
parameter space, allowing self-calibration by combining multiple statistics.
Our results warrant follow-up studies with more extensive lensing simulations

observations, and three independent analysis methods, to derive effective
temperatures, surface gravities, metallicities, projected rotational velocities
and radial velocities, for 15 stars in the field of the open cluster NGC 6811.
We discover two double-lined and three single-lined spectroscopic binaries.
Eight stars are classified as either certain or very probable cluster members,
and three stars are classified as non-members. For four stars, cluster
membership could not been assessed. Five of the observed stars are G-type
giants which are located in the colour-magnitude diagram in the region of the
red clump of the cluster. Two of these stars are surely identified as red clump

of 31 elements. The mean radial-velocity of NGC 6811 is found to be
+6.68$\pm$0.08 km s$^{-1}$ and the mean metallicity and overall abundance

at low signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs), LP decoding is observed to have worse
error performance than belief propagation (BP) decoding. In this paper, we seek
to improve LP decoding at low SNRs while still achieving good high SNR

solve a non-convex optimization problem using the alternating direction method

penalty term to the LP decoding objective. The goal of the penalty term is to
make ""pseudocodewords"", which are the non-integer vertices of the LP relaxation

""ADMM penalized decoder"". In our simulation results, the ADMM penalized decoder
with $\ell_1$ and $\ell_2$ penalties outperforms both BP and LP decoding at all

instanton analysis and show that the ADMM penalized decoder has better high SNR
performance than BP decoding. We also develop a reweighted LP decoder using
linear approximations to the objective with an $\ell_1$ penalty. We show that
this decoder has an improved theoretical recovery threshold compared to LP
decoding. In addition, we show that the empirical gain of the reweighted LP
decoder is significant at low SNRs.

programming (LP) decoding. In order to develop an efficient algorithm, we focus
on non-binary codes in fields of characteristic two. This allows us to
transform each constraint in $\mathbb{F}_{2^m}$ to a set of constraints in
$\mathbb{F}_{2}$ that has a factor graph representation. Applying ADMM to the
LP decoding problem results in two types of non-trivial sub-routines. The first
type requires us to solve an unconstrained quadratic program. We solve this
problem efficiently by leveraging new results obtained from studying the above
factor graphs. The second type requires Euclidean projection onto polytopes
that are studied in the literature, a projection that can be solved efficiently
using off-the-shelf techniques, which scale linearly in the dimension of the
vector to project. ADMM LP decoding scales linearly with block length, linearly
with check degree, and quadratically with field size. The second problem we
consider is a penalized LP decoding problem. This problem is obtained by
incorporating a penalty term into the LP decoding objective. The purpose of the
penalty term is to make non-integer solutions (pseudocodewords) more expensive
and hence to improve decoding performance. The ADMM algorithm for the penalized
LP problem requires Euclidean projection onto a polytope formed by embedding
the constraints specified by the non-binary single parity-check code, which can
be solved by applying the ADMM technique to the resulting quadratic program.
Empirically, this decoder achieves a much reduced error rate than LP decoding
at low signal-to-noise ratios.

gauge-invariant operators, in a lower-spin sector of massless large-$N$ $QCD$,
in terms of glueball and meson propagators, by means of a new purely
field-theoretical technique that we call the asymptotically-free bootstrap. The
asymptotically-free bootstrap exploits the lowest-order conformal invariance of
connected correlators of gauge invariant composite operators in perturbation
theory, the renormalization-group improvement, and a recently-proved asymptotic
structure theorem for glueball and meson propagators, that involves the unknown
particle spectrum and the anomalous dimension of operators for fixed spin. In
principle the asymptotically-free bootstrap extends to all the higher-spin two-
and three-point correlators whose lowest-order conformal limit is non-vanishing
in perturbation theory, and by means of the operator product expansion to the
corresponding asymptotic multi-point correlators as well. Besides, the
asymptotically-free bootstrap provides asymptotic $S$-matrix amplitudes in
massless large-$N$ $QCD$ in terms of glueball and meson propagators as opposed
to perturbation theory. Remarkably, the asymptotic $S$-matrix depends only on
the unknown particle spectrum, but not on the anomalous dimensions. Moreover,
the asymptotically-free bootstrap applies to large-$N$ $\mathcal{N}=1$ $SUSY$
$YM$ as well. Practically, as just a few examples among many more, it follows
the structure of the light by light scattering amplitude, of the pion form
factor, and the associated vector dominance. Theoretically, the asymptotic
solution sets the strongest constraints on any actual solution of large-$N$
$QCD$ (and of large-$N$ $\mathcal{N}=1$ $SUSY$ $YM$), and in particular on any
string solution.

is then accreted by the Milky Way to investigate how a cluster's structure is
affected by a galaxy merger. We find that the cluster's half mass radius will
respond quickly to this change in potential. When the cluster is placed on an
orbit in the Milky Way with a stronger tidal field the cluster experiences a
sharp decrease in size in response to increased tidal forces. Conversely, when
placed on an orbit with a weaker tidal field the cluster expands since tidal
forces decrease and stars moving outwards due to internal effects remain bound
at further distances than before. In all cases, we find that the cluster's half
mass radius will eventually be indistinguishable from a cluster that has always
lived in the Milky Way on that orbit. These adjustments occur within 1-2 half
mass relaxation times of the cluster in the dwarf galaxy. We also find this
effect to be qualitatively independent of the time that the cluster is taken
from the dwarf galaxy. In contrast to the half mass radius, we show the core
radius of the cluster is not affected by the potential the cluster lives in.
Our work suggests that structural properties of accreted clusters are not
distinct from clusters born in the Milky Way. Other cluster properties, such as
metallicity and horizontal branch morphology, may be the only way to identify
accreted star clusters in the Milky Way.

hundred microns. PIC simulations have shown that the electron bunch undergoes
fast RF acceleration, rapidly reaching the desired energies, which can be
controlled by tuning RF injection phase and input driving power. It has been
shown that it is possible to also focus/compress the bunch longitudinally using
a RF-lens, which would allow us to control the temporal resolution of the

decreasing with redshift and for different selection functions in distinct

with their redshifts and supercluster memberships and including the isolated

for delta < -17 deg, which we found to be due to: (1) new superclusters formed
by A-clusters in their cores and surrounded by S-clusters (50%), (2) new
superclusters formed by S-clusters only (40%), (3) redistribution of member
clusters by fragmentation of rich (multiplicity m > 15) superclusters (8%), and
(4) new superclusters formed by the connection of A-clusters through bridges of
S-clusters (2%). Power-law fits to the cumulative supercluster multiplicity
function yield slopes of alpha = -2.0 and alpha = -1.9 for MSCC and SSCC
respectively. This power-law behavior is in agreement with the findings for
other observational samples of superclusters, but not with that of catalogues

which is a new variant of the multi-trip vehicle routing problem with time
windows (VRPTW). In the MPISP, each inspector is scheduled to perform a route
in a given multi-period planning horizon. At the end of each period, each
inspector is not required to return to the depot but has to stay at one of the
vertices for recuperation. If the remaining time of the current period is
insufficient for an inspector to travel from his/her current vertex $A$ to a
certain vertex B, he/she can choose either waiting at vertex A until the start
of the next period or traveling to a vertex C that is closer to vertex B.
Therefore, the shortest transit time between any vertex pair is affected by the
length of the period and the departure time. We first describe an approach of
computing the shortest transit time between any pair of vertices with an
arbitrary departure time. To solve the MPISP, we then propose several local
search operators adapted from classical operators for the VRPTW and integrate
them into a tabu search framework. In addition, we present a constrained
knapsack model that is able to produce an upper bound for the problem. Finally,
we evaluate the effectiveness of our algorithm with extensive experiments based
on a set of test instances. Our computational results indicate that our

photoelectron spectroscopy is employed to measure relative variations in
stoichiometry and the persistence of MoO$_{x}$ species. As MoS$_{2-{\delta}}$

transistors increases while the photoluminescence yield becomes non-uniform.
Devices fabricated from monolayers with the lowest sulfur content have
negligible hysteresis and a threshold voltage of ~0 V. We conclude that the

However, it is not clear how such products may affect the electricity market.
In this paper, we are specifically interested in assessing how the new products
distort the optimal energy dispatch by comparing with the case without such

""distortion cost"". Using a functional approach, we establish the relationship
between the distortion cost and the key parameters of the new products, i.e.,
the up and down flexible ramping requirements. Such relationship yields a novel
routine to efficiently construct the functions, which makes it possible to
efficiently perform the minimal distortion cost energy dispatch while

substantially reduce the distortion cost. We believe our approach can assist

in probabilistic graphical models, where probabilistic relationships between
variables are learned from data in a nonparametric manner. Various algorithms
of kernel Bayesian inference have been developed by combining kernelized basic
probabilistic operations such as the kernel sum rule and kernel Bayes' rule.
However, the current framework is fully nonparametric, and it does not allow a
user to flexibly combine nonparametric and model-based inferences. This is
inefficient when there are good probabilistic models (or simulation models)
available for some parts of a graphical model; this is in particular true in
scientific fields where ""models"" are the central topic of study. Our
contribution in this paper is to introduce a novel approach, termed the {\em
model-based kernel sum rule} (Mb-KSR), to combine a probabilistic model and
kernel Bayesian inference. By combining the Mb-KSR with the existing kernelized
probabilistic rules, one can develop various algorithms for hybrid (i.e.,
nonparametric and model-based) inferences. As an illustrative example, we
consider Bayesian filtering in a state space model, where typically there
exists an accurate probabilistic model for the state transition process. We
propose a novel filtering method that combines model-based inference for the
state transition process and data-driven, nonparametric inference for the
observation generating process. We empirically validate our approach with
synthetic and real-data experiments, the latter being the problem of
vision-based mobile robot localization in robotics, which illustrates the
effectiveness of the proposed hybrid approach.

extreme sensitivity of its charge carriers to external perturbations,
especially those introduced by the substrate. The best available substrates to
date, graphite and hBN, still pose limitations: graphite being metallic does
not allow gating, while both hBN and graphite having lattice structures closely
matched to that of graphene, may cause significant band structure
reconstruction. Here we show that the atomically smooth surface of exfoliated
MoS2 provides access to the intrinsic electronic structure of graphene without
these drawbacks. Using scanning tunneling microscopy and Landau-level
spectroscopy in a device configuration which allows tuning the carrier
concentration, we find that graphene on MoS2 is ultra-flat producing long mean
free paths, while avoiding band structure reconstruction. Importantly, the
screening of the MoS2 substrate can be tuned by changing the position of the
Fermi energy with relatively low gate voltages. We show that shifting the Fermi
energy from the gap to the edge of the conduction band gives rise to enhanced
screening and to a substantial increase in the mean-free-path and quasiparticle
lifetime. MoS2 substrates thus provide unique opportunities to access the
intrinsic electronic properties of graphene and to study in situ the effects of
screening on electron-electron interactions and transport.

several production lines to run in parallel. The excess inventory of catalysts
and substrates decouples these lines, while dynamical balancing tunes average

replication times belonging to the generalized extreme value family. We discuss
biological implications and postulate that bacteria that are tuned by evolution

asymptotic growth rates by stoichiometrically balancing the amount of work in

relativistic approach using observational data provided by galaxy redshift
surveys. Starting from the theory of Ribeiro & Stoeger (2003,
arXiv:astro-ph/0304094) between the mass-to-light ratio, the selection function
obtained from the luminosity function (LF) data and the luminosity density, the
average luminosity $L$ and the average galactic mass $\mathcal{M}_g$ are
computed in terms of the redshift. $\mathcal{M}_g$ is also alternatively
estimated by a method that uses the galaxy stellar mass function (GSMF).
Comparison of these two forms of deriving the average galactic mass allows us
to infer a possible bias introduced by the selection criteria of the survey. We
used the FORS Deep Field galaxy survey sample of 5558 galaxies in the redshift
range $0.5 < z < 5.0$ and its LF Schechter parameters in the B-band, as well as
this sample's stellar mass-to-light ratio and its GSMF data. Assuming
${\mathcal{M}_{g_0}} \approx 10^{11} \mathcal{M}_\odot$ as the local value of
the average galactic mass, the LF approach results in $L_{B} \propto
(1+z)^{(2.40 \pm 0.03)}$ and $\mathcal{M}_g \propto (1+z)^{(1.1\pm0.2)}$.
However, using the GSMF results produces $\mathcal{M}_g \propto (1+z)^{(-0.58
\pm 0.22)}$. We chose the latter result as it is less biased. We then obtained
the theoretical quantities of interest, such as the differential number counts,
to calculate the GCMF, which can be fitted by a Schechter function. The derived
GCMF follows theoretical predictions in which the less massive objects form
first, being followed later by more massive ones. In the range $0.5 < z < 2.0$
the GCMF has a strong variation that can be interpreted as a higher rate of
galaxy mergers or as a strong evolution in the star formation history of these
galaxies.

symmetry, that applies to solve hard graph edge-coloring problems and
demonstrates its use to provide further evidence that the Ramsey number
$R(4,3,3)=30$. The number $R(4,3,3)$ is often presented as the unknown Ramsey
number with the best chances of being found ""soon"". Yet, its precise value has
remained unknown for more than 50 years. We illustrate our approach by showing
that: (1) there are precisely 78{,}892 $(3,3,3;13)$ Ramsey colorings; and (2)
if there exists a $(4,3,3;30)$ Ramsey coloring then it is (13,8,8) regular.
Specifically each node has 13 edges in the first color, 8 in the second, and 8
in the third. We conjecture that these two results will help provide a proof
that no $(4,3,3;30)$ Ramsey coloring exists implying that $R(4,3,3)=30$.

  in two main-chain polydomain smectic-C elastomers","23 pages, 16 figures",,,,"cond-mat.soft cond-mat.mtrl-sci","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Structural studies by synchrotron x-ray diffraction on two main-chain
smectic-C elastomers reveal the presence of two different relaxation mechanisms
in these systems at low and high strains. At low strains, the smectic layers
are reoriented with layer-normals distributed in a plane perpendicular to the
stretch direction. The system relaxes relatively slowly (time-constant ~ 45
minutes) which is attributed to the flow properties of the LC layers embedded
in the elastomer network. At high strains, the equilibration time (~ 4 - 8
minutes) conforms to a faster relaxation and appears to have its origin in the
polymer components of the system. Due to misaligned microdomains at small
strains, the value of global orientational order parameter S for the mesogenic
parts is initially small (~ 0.15). With increasing strain, the local
domain-directors, the mesogens, and the polymer chains, all tend to align
parallel to the stretch direction giving rise to a higher measured value of S ~
0.83 at a strain of 4.0. The siloxane segments remain less ordered, attaining a
value of S ~ 0.4 for a strain of 4.0. The layers gradually become oblique to
the stretch direction conforming to the structural property of the smectic-C
phase. The system finally assumes a chevron-like optically monodomain
structure. Both elastomers are locked-in this state even after removal of the
external stress giving rise to strain retention and the shape memory effect.
The presence of a transverse component in the main-chain leads to higher strain
retention in the second elastomer. A preference for the orientation of the
smectic layer-normals toward the stretch direction persists after removal of
external stress. Upon thermal annealing, the chevron-like microstructure
gradually melts via a different path to the initial polydomain structure.

Each continuous probability distribution describes how information changes with
magnitude. Once one learns to read a probability distribution as a measurement
scale of information, opportunities arise to understand the processes that
generate the commonly observed patterns. Probability expressions may be parsed
into four components: the dissipation of all information, except the
preservation of average values, taken over the measurement scale that relates
changes in observed values to changes in information, and the transformation
from the underlying scale on which information dissipates to alternative scales
on which probability pattern may be expressed. Information invariances set the
commonly observed measurement scales and the relations between them. In
particular, a measurement scale for information is defined by its invariance to
specific transformations of underlying values into measurable outputs.
Essentially all common distributions can be understood within this simple
framework of information invariance and measurement scale.

in cosmic shear measurements. So far theoretical studies of intrinsic
alignments almost exclusively focus on their statistics at the two-point level.
Results from numerical simulations, however, suggest that third-order measures
might be even stronger affected. We therefore investigate the (angular)
bispectrum of intrinsic alignments. In our fully analytical study we describe
intrinsic galaxy ellipticities by a physical alignment model, which makes use
of tidal torque theory. We derive expressions for the various combinations of
intrinsic and gravitationally induced ellipticities, i.e. III-, GII- and
GGI-alignments, and compare our results to the shear bispectrum, the GGG-term.
The latter is computed using hyper-extended perturbation theory. Considering
equilateral and squeezed configurations we find that for a Euclid-like survey
intrinsic alignments (III-alignments) start to dominate on angular scales
smaller than 20 arcmin and 13 arcmin, respectively. This sensitivity to the
configuration-space geometry may allow to exploit the cosmological information
contained in both the intrinsic and gravitationally induced ellipticity field.
On smallest scales (l ~ 3000) III-alignments exceed the lensing signal by at
least one order of magnitude. The amplitude of the GGI-alignments is the
weakest. It stays below that of the shear field on all angular scales
irrespective of the wave-vector configuration.

by a critical subset $T\subseteq S$ of the agents and not the entirety of $S$
due to a budget constraint that limits how large $T$ can be. We show that the
Shapley value can be computed in time faster than by the na\""ive exponential
time algorithm when there are sufficiently many agents, and also provide an
algorithm that approximates the Shapley value within an additive error. For a
related budgeted game associated with a greedy heuristic, we show that the
Shapley value can be computed in pseudo-polynomial time. Furthermore, we
generalize our proof techniques and propose what we term algorithmic
representation framework that captures a broad class of cooperative games with
the property of efficient computation of the Shapley value. The main idea is
that the problem of determining the efficient computation can be reduced to
that of finding an alternative representation of the games and an associated
algorithm for computing the underlying value function with small time and space
complexities in the representation size.

false-positive range. In this situation the performance of a detector should be
assessed on the basis of the area under the ROC curve over that range, rather
than over the full curve, as the performance outside the range is irrelevant.
This measure is labelled as the partial area under the ROC curve (pAUC). We
propose a novel ensemble learning method which achieves a maximal detection
rate at a user-defined range of false positive rates by directly optimizing the
partial AUC using structured learning.
  In order to achieve a high object detection performance, we propose a new
approach to extract low-level visual features based on spatial pooling.
Incorporating spatial pooling improves the translational invariance and thus

for solving convex quadratic programs. It consists in combining the method of
multipliers with an infeasible active-set method. Our approach is iterative. In
each step we calculate an augmented Lagrange function. Then we minimize this
function using an infeasible active-set method that was already successfully
applied to similar problems. After this we update the Lagrange multiplier for
the equality constraints. Finally we try to solve convex quadratic program
directly, again with the infeasible active-set method, starting from the
optimal solution of the actual Lagrange function. Computational experience with
our method indicates that typically only few (most of the time only one) outer
iterations (multiplier-updates) and also only few (most of the time less than
ten) inner iterations (minimization of the Lagrange function) are required to
reach the optimal solution.
  The diploma thesis is organized as follows. We close this chapter with some
nota- tion used throughout. In Chapter 2 we show the equivalence of different
QP problem formulations and present some important so-called direct methods for
solving equality-constrained QPs. We cover the most important aspects for
practically successful interior point methods for linear and convex quadratic
programming in Chapter 3. Chapter 4 deals with ingredients for practically
efficient feasible active set methods. Finally Chapter 5 provides a close
description of our Lagrangian infeasible active set method and further gives a
convergence analysis of the subalgorithms involved.

expressions from High Energy Physics tractable. To this end, Horner's method
can be used. Finding suitable Horner schemes is assumed to be hard, due to the
lack of local heuristics. Recently, MCTS was reported to be able to find near
optimal schemes. However, several parameters had to be fine-tuned manually. In
this work, we investigate the state space properties of Horner schemes and find
that the domain is relatively flat and contains only a few local minima. As a
result, the Horner space is appropriate to be explored by Stochastic Local
Search (SLS), which has only two parameters: the number of iterations
(computation time) and the neighborhood structure. We found a suitable
neighborhood structure, leaving only the allowed computation time as a
parameter. We performed a range of experiments. The results obtained by SLS are
similar or better than those obtained by MCTS. Furthermore, we show that SLS
obtains the good results at least 10 times faster. Using SLS, we can speed up
numerical integration of many real-world large expressions by at least a factor
of 24. For High Energy Physics this means that numerical integrations that took
weeks can now be done in hours.

integrates a distributed Model Predictive Control (MPC) strategy with a
distributed Fault Detection (FD) architecture and methodology in a PnP
framework. The basic concept is to use the FD scheme as an autonomous decision
support system: once a fault is detected, the faulty subsystem can be unplugged
to avoid the propagation of the fault in the interconnected LSS. Analogously,
once the issue has been solved, the disconnected subsystem can be
re-plugged-in. PnP design of local controllers and detectors allow these
operations to be performed safely, i.e. without spoiling stability and
constraint satisfaction for the whole LSS. The PnP distributed MPC is derived
for a class of nonlinear LSS and an integrated PnP distributed FD architecture
is proposed. Simulation results show the effectiveness and the potential of the

follows a power law because the growth of density perturbations is halted in
the dark energy dominated era due to the accelerated expansion of the Universe.

a second order phase transition at zero temperature, and thus a Sarma phase, in
the relativistic setup for large isospin chemical potential. This motivates the
investigation of the cold atoms setup with comparable mean-field phase

for the non-relativistic system we find the stability region of the Sarma phase
to be smaller than the one predicted from mean-field theory. It is limited to
the BEC side of the phase diagram, and the unitary Fermi gas does not support a

Wide-Angle Search for Planets (WASP) light curves supplemented with
lower-precision photometry from the All-Sky Automated Survey (ASAS) for 268 RR
Lyrae stars (176 regular, 92 Blazhko). Light curves were Fourier-decomposed and
coefficients from WASP were transformed to the ASAS standard using 24 common
stars. Coefficients were then compared with similar data from Galactic globular
clusters, the Galactic bulge and the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds (LMC and
SMC). Using Fourier coefficients, we also calculated physical parameters via
standard equations from the literature. We confirmed the results of previous
authors, including lower amplitudes and longer rise times for Blazhko stars. It
was found that in the $R_{31}$ vs. $R_{21}$ plot the location of a star depends
mainly on its metallicity and that Blazhko stars prefer a different location
than modulation-free stars. Field and globular-cluster RR Lyrae variables have
a different $\phi_{21}$ and $\phi_{31}$ than stars in the LMC, SMC and in
Galactic bulge. Although there are some weak indications that Blazhko stars
could prefer a slightly lower metallicity and shorter periods, no convincing
proof was found. The most interesting highlight is the identification of a very
recently proposed new group of metal-rich RR Lyrae type stars. These
low-luminous, metal-strong variables, which comprise both Blazhko and regular
stars, have shorter periods and about a 180 K higher temperature at constant
$(B-V)_{0}$ than the rest of the stars in the sample.

such a current, in contrast to what happens in the electromagnetic case.
Moreover, no frame dependence is observed when we extract the form factors from

We present our results for heavy-light meson decays, i.e. $B\to D$, as well as

fields using the IAC method, involving IAC-pop/MinnIAC codes. The solutions we
derived show an enhanced star formation rate (SFR) in Fields 1 and 3 during the
past 500 Myr. The SFRs of the other fields are almost extinguished at very
recent epochs and. We study the radial gradients of the SFR and consider the
total mass converted into stars in two time intervals (between 0 and 0.5 Gyr
ago and between 0.5 and 13.5 Gyr ago). We find that the scale lengths of the
young and intermediate-to-old populations are perfectly compatible, with the
exception of the young populations in Fields 1 and 3. The recent SF in these
two fields is greater than in the other ones. This might be an indication that
in these two fields we are sampling incipient spiral arms. Further evidence and
new observations are required to prove this hypothesis. In addition, we derived
the age-metallicity relations. As expected, the metallicity increases with time
for all of the fields. We do not observe any radial gradient in the

mathematical quantities aiming at capturing the level of complexity of those
systems is required. Various attempts have been made to measure the empirical
dependencies between the layers of a multiplex, for both binary and weighted

correlation-based metrics: we show that this is equivalent to the use of
completely homogeneous benchmarks specifying only global constraints, such as
the total number of links in each layer. However, these approaches do not take
into account the heterogeneity in the degree and strength distributions, which
are instead a fundamental feature of real-world multiplexes. In this work, we
compare the observed dependencies between layers with the expected values
obtained from reference models that appropriately control for the observed
heterogeneity in the degree and strength distributions. This leads to novel
multiplexity measures that we test on different datasets, i.e. the

findings confirm that the use of homogeneous benchmarks can lead to misleading

we prove the converse to the symmetric cone-variate MY property, which extends
some earlier results. The smoothness assumption for the densities of respective

GVN provides a framework to influence the routing of packets based on service
level information that is carried in the packets. It is based on a protocol
header inserted between the Network and Transport layers, therefore it can be
seen as a layer 3.5 solution. Technically, GVN is proposed as a new transport
layer protocol in the TCP/IP protocol suite. An IP router that is not GVN
capable will simply process the IP destination address as usual. Similar
concepts have been proposed in other works, and referred to as Service Oriented
Networking, Service Centric Networking, Application Delivery Networking, but
they are now generalized in the proposed GVN framework. In this respect, the
GVN header is a generic container that can be adapted to serve the needs of
arbitrary service level routing solutions. The GVN header can be managed by GVN
capable end-hosts and applications or can be pushed/popped at the edge of a GVN
capable network (like a VLAN tag). In this position paper, we show that
Generalized Virtual Networking is a powerful enabler for SCN (Service Centric
Networking) and NFV (Network Function Virtualization) and how it couples with
the SDN (Software Defined Networking) paradigm.

optical photometry obtained with the SMEI instrument on the Coriolis satellite,
2003--2006. A single astrophysical signal is found, with P = (1.780938 \pm
0.000093) d and a mean semi-amplitude of (6.9 \pm 0.3) mmag. There is no
evidence for persistent coherent signals with semi-amplitudes in excess of ca.
2~mmag on any of the timescales previously reported in the literature. In
particular, there is no evidence for a signature of the proposed rotation
period, ca. 5.1~days; zeta Pup is therefore probably not an oblique magnetic
rotator. The 1.8-day signal varies in amplitude by a factor ca. 2 on timescales
of 10--100d (and probably by more on longer timescales), and exhibits modest
excursions in phase, but there is no evidence for systematic changes in period
over the 1000-d span of our observations. Rotational modulation and
stellar-wind variability appear to be unlikely candidates for the underlying
mechanism; we suggest that the physical origin of the signal may be pulsation
associated with low-l oscillatory convection modes.

  Structure and the k-Frobenius Problem",,,,,"math.CO math.NT math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Given an integral $d \times n$ matrix $A$, the well-studied affine semigroup
$\mbox{ Sg} (A)=\{ b : Ax=b, \ x \in {\mathbb Z}^n, x \geq 0\}$ can be
stratified by the number of lattice points inside the parametric polyhedra
$P_A(b)=\{x: Ax=b, x\geq0\}$. Such families of parametric polyhedra appear in
many areas of combinatorics, convex geometry, algebra and number theory. The
key themes of this paper are: (1) A structure theory that characterizes
precisely the subset $\mbox{ Sg}_{\geq k}(A)$ of all vectors $b \in \mbox{
Sg}(A)$ such that $P_A(b) \cap {\mathbb Z}^n $ has at least $k$ solutions. We
demonstrate that this set is finitely generated, it is a union of translated
copies of a semigroup which can be computed explicitly via Hilbert bases
computations. Related results can be derived for those right-hand-side vectors
$b$ for which $P_A(b) \cap {\mathbb Z}^n$ has exactly $k$ solutions or fewer
than $k$ solutions. (2) A computational complexity theory. We show that, when
$n$, $k$ are fixed natural numbers, one can compute in polynomial time an
encoding of $\mbox{ Sg}_{\geq k}(A)$ as a multivariate generating function,
using a short sum of rational functions. As a consequence, one can identify all
right-hand-side vectors of bounded norm that have at least $k$ solutions. (3)
Applications and computation for the $k$-Frobenius numbers. Using Generating
functions we prove that for fixed $n,k$ the $k$-Frobenius number can be
computed in polynomial time. This generalizes a well-known result for $k=1$ by
R. Kannan. Using some adaptation of dynamic programming we show some practical
computations of $k$-Frobenius numbers and their relatives.

present unnecessary barriers to players with sensory, motor and cognitive

Global Game Jam offers a potential avenue to promote inclusive design practices
to students of game development. As such, this paper evaluates the impact of an
initiative to promote inclusive design practices during the 2014 Global Game
Jam. An attitude questionnaire was distributed to both participants and
non-participants at one event venue. The results indicate that, having enrolled
in the initiative, students' attitudes improved. Furthermore, all attendees
reported they were likely to pursue further learning opportunities and consider
accessibility issues in their future games. This suggests that the Global Game
Jam, and other similar events, present an attractive avenue to promote
inclusive design practice within the context of digital game development.
However, further analysis of submitted games, additional qualitative inquiry
and a large-scale trial are needed to determine impact on practice and to form
recommendations for future events.

X-ray range and the spectral coverage is limited. In this paper, we present an
analysis of 32 GRB X-ray flares that are simultaneously observed by both BAT
and XRT on board the Swift mission, so a joint spectral analysis with a wider
spectral coverage is possible. Our results show that the joint spectra of 19
flares are fitted with the absorbed single power-law or the Band function
models. More interestingly, the joint spectra of the other 13 X-ray flares are
fitted with the absorbed single power-law model plus a black body (BB)
component. Phenomenally, the observed spectra of these 13 flares are analogous
to several GRBs with a thermal component, but only with a much lower
temperature of $kT=1\sim 3$ keV. Assuming that the thermal emission is the
photosphere emission of the GRB fireball, we derive the fireball properties of
the 13 flares that have redshift measurements, such as the bulk Lorentz factor
$\Gamma_{\rm ph}$ of the outflow. The derived $\Gamma_{\rm ph}$ range from $50$
to $150$ and a relation of $\Gamma_{\rm ph}$ to the thermal emission luminosity
is found. It is consistent with the $\Gamma_0-L_{\rm iso}$ relation that are
derived for the prompt gamma-ray emission. We discuss the physical implications
of these results within the content of jet composition and radiation mechanism
of GRBs and X-ray flares.

an important role in the secular orbital evolution of the planets, as well as
the rotational evolution of their host. As long as the planet orbits inside the
Alfv\'en surface of the stellar wind, the magnetic interaction between the star
and the planet can modify the wind properties and also lead to direct angular
momentum transfers between the two. We model these star-planet interactions
using compressible magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) simulations, and quantify the
angular momentum transfers between the star, the planet, and the stellar wind.
We study the cases of magnetized and non-magnetized planets and vary the
orbital radius inside the Alfv\'en surface of the stellar wind. Based on a grid
of numerical simulations, we propose general scaling laws for the modification
of the stellar wind torque, for the torque between the star and the planet, and
for the planet migration associated with the star-planet magnetic interactions.
We show that when the coronal magnetic field is large enough and the star is
rotating sufficiently slowly, the effect of the magnetic star-planet
interaction is comparable to tidal effects and can lead to a rapid orbital
decay.

numerically investigate the phase-transition behavior of the distribution of

that an effective exchange field due to the presence of ferromagnets results in
different conditions for Fano destructive interference in each spin channel.
This spin dependence of the Fano effect leads to perfect spin polarization, the
sign of which can be changed by tuning the dots' levels. Large spin
polarization occurs due to Coulomb correlations in the dot, which is not
directly coupled to the leads, while finite correlations in the
directly-coupled dot can further enhance this effect. Moreover, we complement
accurate numerical results with a simple qualitative explanation based on
analytical expressions for the zero-temperature conductance. The proposed

convergence properties using minimum-energy filtering and $H_\infty$ filtering
methodologies. A linear state space plant model is considered observed by a
network of communicating sensors, in which individual sensor measurements may
lead to an unobservable filtering problem. However, each filter locally shares
estimates, that are subject to disturbances, with its respective neighboring
filters to produce an estimate of the plant state. The minimum-energy strategy
of the proposed local filter leads to a locally optimal time-varying filter
gain facilitating the transient and the asymptotic convergence of the
estimation error, with guaranteed $H_\infty$ performance. The filters are
implementable using only the local measurements and information from the
neighboring filters subject to disturbances. A key idea of the proposed
algorithm is to locally approximate the neighboring estimates, that are not
directly accessible, considering them as disturbance contaminated versions of
the plant state. The proposed algorithm imposes minimal communication load on
the network and is scalable to larger sensor networks.

the degree is very important structural parameter of network topology. However,
given the number of nodes and the degree of each node in a network, the

structure. Second,the degree-layer theory is described in detail. Two new
concepts are defined in the theory. An index is proposed to quantitatively
distinguish the two network topologies. It also can quantitatively measure the
stability of network topology built by a model mechanism. One theorem is given
and proved, furthermore, and one corollary is derived directly from the
theorem. Third, the applications of the degree-layer theory are discussed in
the ER random network, WS small world network and BA scale-free network, and
the influences of the degree distribution on the stability of network topology

seemingly contradictory observation that isolated uterine cells are not
spontaneously active. It is known, however, that the expression of gap
junctions increases dramatically in the approach to parturition, which results
in a significant increase in inter-cellular electrical coupling. In this paper,
we build upon previous studies of the activity of electrically excitable smooth
muscle cells (myocytes) and investigate the mechanism through which the
coupling of these cells to electrically passive cells results in the generation
of spontaneous activity in the uterus. Using a recently developed, realistic
model of uterine muscle cell dynamics, we investigate a system consisting of a
myocyte coupled to passive cells. We then extend our analysis to a simple
two-dimensional lattice model of the tissue, with each myocyte being coupled to
its neighbors, as well as to a random number of passive cells. We observe that
different dynamical regimes can be observed over a range of gap junction
conductances: at low coupling strength, the activity is confined to cell
clusters, while the activity for high coupling may spread across the entire
tissue. Additionally, we find that the system supports the spontaneous
generation of spiral wave activity. Our results are both qualitatively and
quantitatively consistent with observations from in vitro experiments. In
particular, we demonstrate that an increase in inter-cellular electrical
coupling, for realistic parameter values, strongly facilitates the appearance
of spontaneous action potentials that may eventually lead to parturition.

extended here to mixtures of linear polymers and hard-sphere colloids. In this
approach groups of monomers are mapped onto a single pseudoatom (a blob) and
the effective blob-blob interactions are obtained by requiring the model to
reproduce some large-scale structural properties in the zero-density limit. We
show that an accurate parametrization of the polymer-colloid interactions is
obtained by simply introducing pair potentials between blobs and colloids. For
the coarse-grained model in which polymers are modelled as four-blob chains
(tetramers), the pair potentials are determined by means of the iterative
Boltzmann inversion scheme, taking full-monomer pair correlation functions at
zero-density as targets. For a larger number $n$ of blobs, pair potentials are
determined by using a simple transferability assumption based on the polymer
self-similarity. We validate the model by comparing its predictions with
full-monomer results for the interfacial properties of polymer solutions in the
presence of a single colloid and for thermodynamic and structural properties in
the homogeneous phase at finite polymer and colloid density. The tetramer model
is quite accurate for $q\lesssim 1$ ($q=\hat{R}_g/R_c$, where $\hat{R}_g$ is
the zero-density polymer radius of gyration and $R_c$ is the colloid radius)

is a set, then the $n$-cube $B^n$ may be seen as an $n$-grid, where the
equivalence classes of $E_i$ are the lines parallel to the $i$-th coordinate
axis. We use elementary submodels of the universe to characterize those
$n$-grids which admit an acceptable coloring. As an application we show that if
an $n$-grid $\mathcal{A}$ does not admit an acceptable coloring, then every
finite $n$-cube is embeddable in $\mathcal{A}$.

"1409.5313","Holger Machens","Holger Machens","Sandboxing for Software Transactional Memory with Deferred Updates",,,,,"cs.DC","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/publicdomain/","  Software transactional memory implementations which allow transactions to
work on inconsistent states of shared data, risk to cause application visible
errors such as memory access violations or endless loops. Hence, many
implementations rely on repeated incremental validation of every read of the
transaction to always guarantee for a consistent view of shared data. Because
this eager validation technique generates significant processing costs several
proposals have been published to establish a sandbox for transactions, which
transparently prevents or suppresses those errors and thereby allows to reduce
the frequency of in-flight validations.
  The most comprehensive sandboxing concept of transactions in software
transactional memory based on deferred updates and considering unmanaged
languages, integrates multiple techniques such as signal interposition,
out-of-band validation and static and dynamic instrumentation. The latter
comprises the insertion of a validation barrier in front of every direct write
which addresses the execution stack of the thread and potentially results from
unvalidated reads.
  This paper basically results from a review of this sandboxing approach, which
revealed some improvements for sandboxing on C/C++. Based on knowledge about
the runtime environment and the compiler an error model has been developed to
identify critical paths to application visible errors. This analysis lead to a
concept for stack protection with less frequent validation, an alternative
out-of-band validation technique and revealed additional risks of so-called
waivered regions without instrumentation inside transactions.

often unrealistic to hope for consistently perfect recognition accuracy. We
present a system which captures all recognizable interpretations of the input

descriptions of human contact patterns occurring in various day-to-day life
contexts. Recent technological advances and the development of wearable sensors
able to sense proximity patterns have made it possible to gather data giving
access to time-varying contact networks of individuals in specific
environments. Here we present and analyze two such data sets describing with
high temporal resolution the contact patterns of students in a high school. We
define contact matrices describing the contact patterns between students of
different classes and show the importance of the class structure. We take
advantage of the fact that the two data sets were collected in the same setting
during several days in two successive years to perform a longitudinal analysis
on two very different timescales. We show the high stability of the contact
patterns across days and across years: the statistical distributions of numbers
and durations of contacts are the same in different periods, and we observe a
very high similarity of the contact matrices measured in different days or
different years. The rate of change of the contacts of each individual from one
day to the next is also similar in different years. We discuss the interest of
the present analysis and data sets for various fields, including in social
sciences in order to better understand and model human behavior and
interactions in different contexts, and in epidemiology in order to inform

of an\-iso\-tro\-pic Besov spaces. The decoupling method is based on a general
distributional approach and not restricted to the Wiener space.
  The class of Besov spaces we introduce contains the traditional isotropic
Besov spaces obtained by the real interpolation method, but also new spaces
that are designed to investigate backwards stochastic differential equations
(BSDEs). As examples we discuss the Besov regularity (in the sense of our
spaces) of forward diffusions and local times. It is shown that among our newly
introduced Besov spaces there are spaces that characterize quantitative
properties of directional derivatives in the Malliavin sense without computing
or accessing these Malliavin derivatives explicitly.
  Regarding BSDEs, we deduce regularity properties of the solution processes
from the Besov regularity of the initial data, in particular upper bounds for
their $L_p$-variation, where the generator might be of quadratic type and where
no structural assumptions, for example in terms of a forward diffusion, are
assumed. As an example we treat sub-quadratic BSDEs with unbounded terminal
conditions.
  Among other tools, we use methods from harmonic analysis. As a by-product, we
improve the asymptotic behaviour of the multiplicative constant in a
generalized Fefferman inequality and verify the optimality of the bound we
established.

inflation in string theory. The energy scale of inflation can be as high as
that of Grand Unification (GUT). If this is the case, this is the closest we
can possibly get in energy scales to string-scale physics. Hence, GUT-scale
inflation may be our best candidate phenomenon to preserve traces of
string-scale dynamics. Our chance to look for such traces is the primordial
gravitational wave, or tensor mode signal produced during inflation. For
GUT-scale inflation this is strong enough to be potentially visible as a B-mode
polarization of the cosmic microwave background (CMB). Moreover, a GUT-scale
inflation model has a trans-Planckian excursion of the inflaton scalar field
during the observable amount of inflation. Such large-field models of inflation
have a clear need for symmetry protection against quantum corrections. This
makes them ideal candidates for a description in a candidate fundamental theory

for UV completion makes them particularly susceptible to preserve imprints of
their string-scale dynamics in the inflationary observables, the spectral index

for a selected set of one-body observables is formed by stochastic sampling
from a phase-space distribution that reproduces the initial quantum
fluctuations. Independent mean-field evolutions are performed with each set of
initial values followed by averaging over the resulting ensemble. This approach
has been recently shown to be rather versatile and accurate in describing the
correlated dynamics beyond the independent particle picture. In the original
formulation of SMF, it was proposed to use a Gaussian assumption for the
phase-space distribution. This assumption turns out to be rather effective when
the dynamics of an initially uncorrelated state is considered, which was the
case in all applications of this approach up to now. Using the
Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick (LMG) model, we show that such an assumption might not be
adequate if the quantum system under interest is initially correlated and
presents configuration mixing between several Slater determinants. In this
case, a more realistic description of the initial phase-space is necessary. We
show that the SMF approach can be advantageously combined with standard methods
to describe phase-space in quantum mechanics. As an illustration, the Husimi
distribution function is used here to obtain a realistic representation of the
phase-space of a quantum many-body system. This method greatly improves the
description of initially correlated fermionic many-body states. In the LMG
model, while the Gaussian approximation failed to describe these systems in all
interaction strength range, the novel approach gives a perfect agreement with
the exact evolution in the weak coupling regime and significantly improves the
description of correlated systems in the strong coupling regime.

  Language Processing","Accepted at AAAI-16",,,,"cs.LG cs.NE cs.SE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Programming language processing (similar to natural language processing) is a
hot research topic in the field of software engineering; it has also aroused
growing interest in the artificial intelligence community. However, different
from a natural language sentence, a program contains rich, explicit, and
complicated structural information. Hence, traditional NLP models may be
inappropriate for programs. In this paper, we propose a novel tree-based
convolutional neural network (TBCNN) for programming language processing, in
which a convolution kernel is designed over programs' abstract syntax trees to
capture structural information. TBCNN is a generic architecture for programming
language processing; our experiments show its effectiveness in two different
program analysis tasks: classifying programs according to functionality, and
detecting code snippets of certain patterns. TBCNN outperforms baseline
methods, including several neural models for NLP.

equation. The study of various examples shows that the resulting effective
properties are different from those of the homogenized pressure wave equation
for the same underlying acoustic parameters. A careful analysis reveals that a
given set of inhomogeneous parameters represents an entirely different physical
system depending on the considered equation. Our findings unveil a different
way of tailoring acoustic properties through gradients of the static pressure.
In contrast to standard metafluids based on isobaric composites, this
alternative kind of metafluids is suitable for the implementation of
transformational devices designed via the velocity potential equation. This
includes acoustic systems in a moving background or arising from general
space-time transformations. As an example, we design a device able to cloak the
acoustic velocity potential.

  Accepted by MNRAS",,"10.1093/mnras/stu2440",,"astro-ph.HE astro-ph.GA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The dimensions of Fanaroff-Riley class I jets and the stellar densities at
galactic centres imply that there will be numerous interactions between the jet
and stellar winds. These may give rise to the observed diffuse and 'knotty'
structure of the jets in the X-ray, and can also mass load the jets. We
performed modelling of internal entrainment from stars intercepted by Centaurus
A's jet, using stellar evolution- and wind codes. From photometry and a
code-synthesised population of 12 Gyr (Z = 0.004), 3 Gyr (Z = 0.008) and 0 - 60
Myr (Z = 0.02) stars, appropriate for the parent elliptical NGC 5128, the total
number of stars in the jet is ~ 8 x 10^8. Our model is energetically capable of
producing the observed X-ray emission, even without young stars. We also
reproduce the radio through X-ray spectrum of the jet, albeit in a downstream
region with distinctly fewer young stars, and recover the mean X-ray spectral
index. We derive an internal entrainment rate of ~ 2.3 x 10^-3 Msun yr^-1 which
implies substantial jet deceleration. Our absolute nucleosynthetic yields for
the AGB stellar population in the jet show the highest amounts for 4He, 16O,
12C, 14N and 20Ne. If some of the events at >= 55 EeV detected by the Pierre
Auger Observatory originate from internal entrainment in Centaurus A, we
predict that their composition will be largely intermediate-mass nuclei with
16O, 12C and 14N the key isotopes.

technique especially mastered by people with hearing difficulties. The ability
to lip read enables a person with a hearing impairment to communicate with
others and to engage in social activities, which otherwise would be difficult.
Recent advances in the fields of computer vision, pattern recognition, and
signal processing has led to a growing interest in automating this challenging
task of lip reading. Indeed, automating the human ability to lip read, a
process referred to as visual speech recognition, could open the door for other
novel applications. This thesis investigates various issues faced by an
automated lip-reading system and proposes a novel ""visual words"" based approach
to automatic lip reading. The proposed approach includes a novel automatic face
localisation scheme and a lip localisation method.
