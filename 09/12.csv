stripping in elliptical galaxies using ideal magnetohydrodynamics simulations.
We consider weakly-magnetised interstellar medium (ISM) characterised by
subsonic turbulence, and two orientations of the magnetic fields in the
intracluster medium (ICM) - parallel and perpendicular to the direction of the
galaxy motion through the ICM. While the stronger turbulence enhances the ram
pressure stripping mass loss, the magnetic fields tend to suppress the
stripping rates, and the suppression is stronger for parallel fields. However,
the effect of magnetic fields on the mass stripping rate is mild. Nevertheless,
the morphology of the stripping tails depends significantly on the direction of
the ICM magnetic field. The effect of the magnetic field geometry on the tail
morphology is much stronger than that of the level of the ISM turbulence. The
tail has a highly collimated shape for parallel fields, while it has a
sheet-like morphology in the plane of the ICM magnetic field for perpendicular
fields. The magnetic field in the tail is amplified irrespectively of the
orientation of the ICM field. More strongly magnetised regions in the ram
pressure stripping tails are expected to have systematically higher metallicity
due to the strong concentration of the stripped ISM than the less magnetised
regions. Strong dependence of the morphology of the stripped ISM on the
magnetic field could potentially be used to constrain the relative orientation
of the ram pressure direction and the dominant component of the ICM magnetic
field.

quasi-elastic neutron scattering (QENS). The goal is to assess the
baro-protective benefits of trehalose on bio-molecules by comparing the
findings with those of a trehalose-free reference study. While the mean-square
displacement of the trehalose-free protein (hydrated to $d_{D_2O}\simeq$40 w\%)
as a whole, is reduced by increasing pressure, the actual observable relaxation
dynamics in the pico-(ps) to nano-seconds (ns) time range remains largely
unaffected by pressure - up to the maximum investigated pressure of 2.78(2)
Kbar. Our observation is independent of whether or not the protein is mixed
with the deuterated sugar. This suggests that the hydrated protein's
conformational states at atmospheric pressure remain unaltered by hydrostatic
pressures, below 2.78 Kbar. We also found the QENS response to be totally
recoverable after ambient pressure conditions are restored. Circular dichroism
and neutron diffraction measurements confirm that the protein structural
integrity is conserved and remains intact, after pressure is released. We
observe however a clear narrowing of the quasi-elastic neutron (QENS) response
as the temperature is decreased from 290 K to 230 K in both cases, which we
parametrize using the Kohlrausch-Williams-Watts (KWW) stretched exponential
model. Only the fraction of protons that are immobile on the accessible time
window of the instrument, referred to as the elastic incoherent structure
factor or (EISF) is observably sensitive to pressure, increasing only
marginally but systematically with increasing pressure.

revealed negative magnetoresistances (MRs) (up to 28%) for modest magnetic
fields (250 mT) applied within the IrO2 a-b plane and electric currents flowing

four-fold to two-fold symmetry in response to an increasing magnetic field with

Matroids are combinatorial abstractions of linear subspaces and hyperplane
arrangements. Not all matroids come from linear subspaces; those that do are
said to be representable. Still, one may apply linear algebraic constructions
to non-representable matroids. There are a number of different definitions of
matroids, a phenomenon known as cryptomorphism. In this survey, we begin by
reviewing the classical definitions of matroids, develop operations in matroid
theory, summarize some results in representability, and construct polynomial
invariants of matroids. Afterwards, we focus on matroid polytopes, introduced
by Gelfand-Goresky-MacPherson-Serganova, which give a cryptomorphic definition
of matroids. We explain certain locally closed subsets of the Grassmannian,
thin Schubert cells, which are labeled by matroids, and which have applications
to representability, moduli problems, and invariants of matroids following
Fink-Speyer. We explain how matroids can be thought of as cohomology classes in
a particular toric variety, the permutohedral variety, by means of Bergman
fans, and apply this description to give an exposition of the proof of
log-concavity of the characteristic polynomial of representable matroids due to

find that when the system carries a single electron on average the formation of
the steady state is strongly influenced by the coherence between the dots. The
latter can be sizeable and indeed larger in the presence of a bias voltage than
it is in equilibrium. Moreover, the interdot coherence is shown to lead to a
pronounced difference in the population of the dots.

diagram has innovations in multiple aspects. In the proposed new deep
architecture, a new deformation constrained pooling (def-pooling) layer models
the deformation of object parts with geometric constraint and penalty. With the
proposed multi-stage training strategy, multiple classifiers are jointly
optimized to process samples at different difficulty levels. A new pre-training
strategy is proposed to learn feature representations more suitable for the
object detection task and with good generalization capability. By changing the
net structures, training strategies, adding and removing some key components in
the detection pipeline, a set of models with large diversity are obtained,
which significantly improves the effectiveness of modeling averaging. The
proposed approach ranked \#2 in ILSVRC 2014. It improves the mean averaged
precision obtained by RCNN, which is the state-of-the-art of object detection,
from $31\%$ to $45\%$. Detailed component-wise analysis is also provided
through extensive experimental evaluation.

taken with the newly commissioned Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE)
integral field spectrograph. Because of the relatively large field of view (1
arcmin^2), MUSE is ideal to simultaneously target multiple galaxies in blank
and cluster fields over the full optical spectrum. We analysed the four hours
of data obtained in the Science Verification phase on this cluster and measured
redshifts for 53 galaxies. We confirm the redshift of five cluster galaxies,
and determine the redshift of 29 other cluster members. Behind the cluster, we
find 17 galaxies at higher redshift, including three previously unknown
Lyman-alpha emitters at z>3, and five multiply-lensed galaxies. We report the
detection of a new z=4.113 multiply lensed galaxy, with images that are
consistent with lensing model predictions derived for the Frontier Fields. We
detect C III], C IV, and He II emission in a multiply lensed galaxy at z=3.116,
suggesting the likely presence of an active galactic nucleus. We also created
narrow-band images from the MUSE datacube to automatically search for
additional line emitters corresponding to high-redshift candidates, but we
could not identify any significant detections other than those found by visual
inspection. With the new redshifts, it will become possible to obtain an
accurate mass reconstruction in the core of Abell S1063 through refined strong
lensing modelling. Overall, our results illustrate the breadth of scientific
topics that can be addressed with a single MUSE pointing. We conclude that MUSE
is a very efficient instrument to observe galaxy clusters, enabling their mass
modelling, and to perform a blind search for high-redshift galaxies.

  perturbative QCD","PhD thesis",,,,"hep-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The aim of this thesis is to calculate field-theoretically as rigorously as
possible the initial state of partonic matter produced in ultrarelativistic
heavy-ion collisions at CERN-LHC and BNL-RHIC colliders. The computed minijet
initial conditions are then used in the initialization of the relativistic
hydrodynamical modeling of these collisions.
  In the theoretical introduction part the computation of parton production
cross section at next-to-leading order (NLO) perturbative QCD (pQCD) is
discussed. Furthermore, the full analytical calculation for the squared
quark-quark scattering matrix element including the systematic ultraviolet
renormalization is presented. Finally, the subtraction method allowing for the
cancellation of the infrared and collinear singularities in the partonic QCD
cross section at NLO is discussed.
  In the more phenomenological part of the thesis the original EKRT model,
which combines collinearly factorized leading-order pQCD minijet production
with gluon saturation, is introduced. Next, the minijet production is
generalized rigorously to NLO. In particular, a new set of measurement
functions is introduced to define the produced infrared- and collinear-safe
minijet transverse energy, in terms of which the saturation is now formulated.
Finally, the framework is updated with the latest knowledge of nuclear parton
distribution functions.
  Using the NLO-improved EKRT model with hydrodynamics we obtained a good
agreement with the measured centrality dependence of the
low-transverse-momentum bulk observables, simultaneously at the LHC and RHIC.
In particular, aiming at a determination of the QCD matter properties from
these measurements, we were able to constrain the temperature dependence of the
QCD matter shear viscosity, which is an important result.

law. For spherical entangling surfaces, this has been shown to follow via the
AdS/CFT correspondence and the holographic prescription for entanglement
entropy from the bulk first law for Killing horizons. The bulk first law can be
extended to include variations in the cosmological constant $\Lambda$, which we
established in earlier work. Here we show that this implies an extension of the
boundary first law to include varying the number of degrees of freedom of the
boundary CFT. The thermodynamic potential conjugate to $\Lambda$ in the bulk is
called the thermodynamic volume and has a simple geometric formula. In the
boundary first law it plays the role of a chemical potential. For the bulk
minimal surface $\Sigma$ corresponding to a boundary sphere, the thermodynamic
volume is found to be proportional to the area of $\Sigma$, in agreement with
the variation of the known result for entanglement entropy of spheres. The
dependence of the CFT chemical potential on the entanglement entropy and number
of degrees of freedom is similar to how the thermodynamic chemical potential of
an ideal gas depends on entropy and particle number.

Building upon our earlier work with Baez and Wise on the representation theory
of 2-groups, we construct a four-dimensional state sum model based on a
categorified version of the Euclidean group. We define and explicitly compute
the simplex weights, which may be viewed a categorified analogue of
Racah-Wigner 6$j$-symbols. These weights solve an hexagon equation that encodes
the formal invariance of the state sum under the Pachner moves of the

involves the scattering process of quantum stochastic calculus. We show that
while the scattering process may be approximated in a singular limit by regular
processes using different schemes, however the limit model is highly sensitive
to how the approximation scheme is interpreted mathematically. We find two main
types of stochastic limits of regular models, and illustrate the origin of this
difference at the level of one particle scattering. As an alternative modelling
scheme, we consider models of mirrors as non-trivial dielectric medium with a
boundary that is itself quantized. Rather than treating the plane waves for the
electromagnetic field, we take the actual physical modes and quantize these.
The input-output formalism is then obtained in the far zone where the plane
wave approximation is valid. Several examples are considered, and the quantum
stochastic model is derived. We also consider the quantum trajectories problem
for continual measurement of the reflect output fields, and derive the
stochastic master equations for homodyning and photon counting detection to
estimate the mirror observables.

electron spin resonance (ESR) spectroscopy. Recently, new features have been
observed in the spectra of dopants in isotopically enriched 28Si since the
reduced inhomogeneous linewidth in this material improves spectral resolution.
With this in mind, we measured ESR on exchange coupled phosphorus dimers in
28Si and report two results. First, a new fine structure is observed in the ESR
spectrum arising from state mixing by the hyperfine coupling to the 31P nuclei,
which is enhanced when the exchange energy is comparable to the Zeeman energy.
This fine structure enables us to spectroscopically address two separate dimer
sub-ensembles, the first with exchange (J) coupling ranging from 2 to 7 GHz and
the second with J ranging from 6 to 60 GHz. Next, the average spin relaxation
times, T1 and T2 of both dimer sub-ensembles were measured using pulsed ESR at
0.35 T. Both T1 and T2 for transitions between triplet states of the dimers
were found to be identical to the relaxation times of isolated phosphorus
donors in 28Si, with T2 = 4 ms at 1.7 K limited by spectral diffusion due to
dipolar interactions with neighboring donor electron spins. This result,
consistent with theoretical predictions, implies that an exchange coupling of 2

applied ADP method is approximate linear program (ALP) which makes use of
linear function approximation and offers theoretical performance guarantees.
Nevertheless, the ALP is difficult to solve due to the presence of a large
number of constraints and in practice, a reduced linear program (RLP) is solved
instead. The RLP has a tractable number of constraints sampled from the
original constraints of the ALP. Though the RLP is known to perform well in

  In this paper, we generalize the RLP to define a generalized reduced linear

positive linear combinations of the original constraints of the ALP. The main
contribution of this paper is the novel theoretical framework developed to
obtain error bounds for any given GRLP. Central to our framework are two
$\max$-norm contraction operators. Our result solves theoretically justifies
linear approximation of constraints. We discuss the implication of our results
in the contexts of ADP and reinforcement learning. We also demonstrate via an

disturbance, we find that weak measurements are disturbing. (2) For a weaker
definition we find that a general class of weak measurements are
non-disturbing, but that one gets weak values which depend on the measurement
process. (3) Finally, with respect to an operational definition of the `degree
of disturbance', we find that the AAV weak measurements are the least
disturbing, but that the disturbance is always non-zero.

$\tau$, as measured from cosmic microwave background polarization. All probes

this model out at more than $8\sigma$ significance. In conservative models of

Laguerre-Gaussian beams carrying orbital angular momentum. As an example, we
present a metasurface made of double-split ring slot pairs and report a good
agreement between simulated and analytical results. Both a high
magnetic-to-electric-field contrast ratio and a magnetic field enhancement are
achieved. We also investigate the metasurface physical constraints to convert a
linearly polarized beam into an azimuthally E- polarized beam and characterize
the performance of magnetic field enhancement and electric field suppression of
a realistic metasurface. These findings are potentially useful for novel
optical spectroscopy related to magnetic dipolar transitions and for optical
manipulation of particles with spin and orbital angular momentum.

classical and quantum cryptography as well as device independent randomness
amplification and expansion. Furthermore they are also a useful tool in quantum
Shannon theory. It is known that some extractor constructions are quantum-proof
whereas others are provably not [Gavinsky et al., STOC'07]. We argue that the
theory of operator spaces offers a natural framework for studying to what
extent extractors are secure against quantum adversaries: we first phrase the
definition of extractors as a bounded norm condition between normed spaces, and
then show that the presence of quantum adversaries corresponds to a completely
bounded norm condition between operator spaces. From this we show that very
high min-entropy extractors as well as extractors with small output are always
(approximately) quantum-proof. We also study a generalization of extractors
called randomness condensers. We phrase the definition of condensers as a
bounded norm condition and the definition of quantum-proof condensers as a
completely bounded norm condition. Seeing condensers as bipartite graphs, we
then find that the bounded norm condition corresponds to an instance of a well
studied combinatorial problem, called bipartite densest subgraph. Furthermore,
using the characterization in terms of operator spaces, we can associate to any
condenser a Bell inequality (two-player game) such that classical and quantum
strategies are in one-to-one correspondence with classical and quantum attacks
on the condenser. Hence, we get for every quantum-proof condenser (which
includes in particular quantum-proof extractors) a Bell inequality that can not
be violated by quantum mechanics.

metallicity and alpha-element abundances of stars over a large part of the
Milky Way disk. Using a sample of ~10,000 kinematically-unbiased red-clump

distribution of this sample exhibits a bimodality in [alpha/Fe] at intermediate
metallicities, -0.9<[Fe/H]<-0.2, but at higher metallicities ([Fe/H]=+0.2) the
two sequences smoothly merge. We investigate the effects of the APOGEE
selection function and volume filling fraction and find that these have little

abundance pattern is found throughout the range 5<R<11 kpc and 0<|Z|<2 kpc

molecular-gas-dominated regions of nearby spirals. This result suggests that
the early evolution of the Milky Way disk was characterized by stars that
shared a similar star formation history and were formed in a well-mixed,
turbulent, and molecular-dominated ISM with a gas consumption timescale (1/SFE)
of ~2 Gyr. Finally, while the two alpha-element sequences in the inner Galaxy
can be explained by a single chemical evolutionary track this cannot hold in
the outer Galaxy, requiring instead a mix of two or more populations with
distinct enrichment histories.

to, or even larger than, the white dwarf's pressure scale height, casting doubt
on the successful ignition of helium detonations in these systems. In this
paper, we examine the previously neglected effects of C/O pollution and a full
nuclear reaction network, and we consider hotspots with spatially constant
pressure in addition to constant density hotspots. We find that the inclusion
of these effects significantly decreases the minimum hotspot size for
helium-rich detonation ignition, making detonations far more plausible during
turbulent shell convection or during double white dwarf mergers. The increase
in burning rate also decreases the minimum shell mass in which a helium
detonation can successfully propagate and alters the composition of the shell's
burning products. The ashes of these low mass shells consist primarily of
silicon, calcium, and unburned helium and metals and may explain the
high-velocity spectral features observed in most Type Ia supernovae.

states, are known to have matrix-product structure (with unbounded bond

obscure, {\em unless} one goes back to the original first quantized picture of
analytic lowest Landau level wave functions. This step involves putting back
additional degrees of freedom associated with dynamical momenta, and one
wonders whether the addition of these degrees of freedom is truly necessary to
recognize the frustration free character of the underlying lattice Hamiltonian.
Fundamentally, these degrees of freedom have nothing to do with spectrum of a

show that zero mode properties, and hence the frustration free character, of

associated with long-duration $\gamma$-ray bursts (GRB-SNe), as well as local
relativistic SNe IcBL that are not associated with GRBs. Building upon recent
results that found a luminosity$-$stretch relationship for a sample of nine
GRB-SNe, we demonstrate that GRB-SNe and SNe IcBL have statistically
significant luminosity$-$decline relationships in $BVR$ filters at the $p=0.02$
confidence level. Conversely, we show that SNe Ib, Ic and IIb do not have
statistically significant luminosity$-$decline relationships. Two of the
relativistic SNe IcBL in our sample have independent distance measurements (SN
2009bb and SN 2012ap) that we used to constrain a weighted-average value of
${H}_{0,\rm w}=82.5\pm8.1$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$. This value is 1$\sigma$
greater than that obtained using SNe Ia, and 2$\sigma$ larger than that
determined by Planck. This difference can be attributed to large peculiar
motions of the host galaxies of the two SNe IcBL, which are members of galaxy
groups. When determining a value of $H_{0}$ using SNe Ib, Ic and IIb, we found
an average value of $H_{0}$ that has a standard deviation of order $20-40$ km
s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$, which demonstrates that these SNe are poor cosmological
candles. With the launch of the next generation of space telescopes, SNe IcBL,
and in particular GRB-SNe, have the potential to constrain constrain the Hubble

than 20 orders of magnitude in density. Molecular hydrogen cooling is
suppressed by a strong Lyman-Werner background, which facilitates the
near-isothermal collapse of the gas at a temperature of about $10^4\,$K. Once
the central gas cloud becomes optically thick to continuum emission, it settles
into a Keplerian disc around the primary protostar. The initial mass of the
protostar is about $0.1\,{\rm M}_\odot$, which is an order of magnitude higher
than in minihaloes that cool via molecular hydrogen. The high accretion rate
and efficient cooling of the gas catalyse the fragmentation of the disc into a
small protostellar system with 5-10 members. After about 12 yr, strong
gravitational interactions disrupt the disc and temporarily eject the primary
protostar from the centre of the cloud. By the end of the simulation, a
secondary clump has collapsed at a distance of $\simeq 150\,$au from the
primary clump. If this clump undergoes a similar evolution as the first, the
central gas cloud may evolve into a wide binary system. High accretion rates of
both the primary and secondary clumps suggest that fragmentation is not a
significant barrier for forming at least one massive black hole seed.

flow maintains approximate conditions of fully developed turbulence, with
departures thereof settling in about an eddy-turnover-time. Turbulent velocity
dispersion remains above $700$ km s$^{-1}$ even at low mass accretion rate,
with the fraction of compressional energy between 10% and 40%. Normalisation
and slope of compressional turbulence is susceptible to large variations on
short time scales, unlike the incompressible counterpart. A major merger occurs
around redshift $z\simeq0$ and is accompanied by a long period of enhanced
turbulence, ascribed to temporal clustering of mass accretion related to
spatial clustering of matter. We test models of stochastic acceleration by
compressional modes for the origin of diffuse radio emission in galaxy
clusters. The turbulence simulation model constrains an important unknown of
this complex problem and brings forth its dependence on the elusive
micro-physics of the intracluster plasma. In particular, the specifics of the
plasma collisionality and the dissipation physics of weak shocks affect the
cascade of compressional modes with strong impact on the acceleration rates. In
this context radio halos emerge as complex phenomena in which a hierarchy of
processes acting on progressively smaller scales are at work. Stochastic
acceleration by compressional modes implies statistical correlation of radio
power and spectral index with merging cores distance, both testable in
principle with radio surveys.

atmospheres comprising a few percent by mass of their rocky cores. We determine
the conditions under which such atmospheres can be accreted by cores from their
parent circumstellar disks. Accretion from the nebula is problematic because it
is too efficient: we find that 10-$M_\oplus$ cores embedded in solar
metallicity disks tend to undergo runaway gas accretion and explode into
Jupiters, irrespective of orbital location. The threat of runaway is especially
dire at $\sim$0.1 AU, where solids may coagulate on timescales orders of
magnitude shorter than gas clearing times; thus nascent atmospheres on close-in
orbits are unlikely to be supported against collapse by planetesimal accretion.
The time to runaway accretion is well approximated by the cooling time of the
atmosphere's innermost convective zone, whose extent is controlled by where
H$_2$ dissociates. Insofar as the temperatures characterizing H$_2$
dissociation are universal, timescales for core instability tend not to vary
with orbital distance --- and to be alarmingly short for 10-$M_\oplus$ cores.
Nevertheless, in the thicket of parameter space, we identify two scenarios, not
mutually exclusive, that can reproduce the preponderance of percent-by-mass
atmospheres for super-Earths at $\sim$0.1 AU, while still ensuring the
formation of Jupiters at $\gtrsim 1$ AU. Scenario (a): planets form in disks
with dust-to-gas ratios that range from $\sim$20$\times$ solar at 0.1 AU to
$\sim$2$\times$ solar at 5 AU. Scenario (b): the final assembly of super-Earth
cores from mergers of proto-cores --- a process that completes quickly at
$\sim$0.1 AU once begun --- is delayed by gas dynamical friction until just
before disk gas dissipates completely.

on a mixed three-field formulation that accounts for tangential fluidity
(Boussinesq-Scriven law), bending elasticity (Canham-Helfrich model) and
inextensibility. The unknowns are the velocity, vector curvature and surface
pressure fields, all of which are interpolated with linear continuous finite
elements. The method is semi-implicit - it requires the solution of a single
linear system per time step. Conditional time stability is observed, with a
time step restriction that scales as the square of the mesh size. Mesh quality
and refinement are maintained by adaptively remeshing. Another ingredient is a
numerical force that emulates the action of an optical tweezer, allowing for
virtual interaction with the membrane. Extensive relaxation experiments are
reported. Comparisons to exact shapes reveal the orders of convergence for
position (5/3), vector curvature (3/2), surface pressure (1) and bending energy
(2). Tweezing experiments are also presented. Convergence to the exact dynamics
of a cylindrical tether is confirmed. Further tests illustrate the robustness
of the method (six tweezers acting simultaneously) and the significance of
viscous effects on membrane deformation under external forces.

develop a theory of photosphere emission of a hybrid relativistic outflow with
a hot fireball component (defined by dimensionless entropy $\eta$) and a cold
Poynting-flux component (defined by magnetization $\sigma_0$ at the central
engine). We consider the scenarios both without and with sub-photospheric
magnetic dissipations. Based on a simplified toy model of jet dynamics, we
develop two approaches: a ""bottom-up"" approach to predict the temperature (for
a non-dissipative photosphere) and luminosity of the photosphere emission and
its relative brightness for a given pair of $(\eta,\sigma_0)$; and a ""top-down""
approach to diagnose central engine parameters ($\eta$ and $\sigma_0$) based on
the observed quasi-thermal photosphere emission properties. We show that a
variety of observed GRB prompt emission spectra with different degrees of
photosphere thermal emission can be reproduced by varying $\eta$ and $\sigma_0$
within the non-dissipative photosphere scenario. In order to reproduce the
observed spectra, the outflows of most GRBs need to have a significant
$\sigma$, both at the central engine, and at the photosphere. The $\sigma$
value at $10^{15}$ cm from the central engine (a possible non-thermal emission
site) is usually also greater than unity, so that internal-collision-induced
magnetic reconnection and turbulence (ICMART) may be the mechanism to power the
non-thermal emission. We apply our top-down approach to GRB 110721A, and find
that the temporal evolution behavior of its blackbody component can be well
interpreted with a time-varying $(\eta,\sigma_0)$ at the central engine,
instead of invoking a varying engine base size $r_0$ as proposed by previous

in a simple way the photometric and radial velocity variations induced by
active regions. The inhibition of the convective blueshift inside active
regions is considered, as well as the limb brightening effect of plages, a
quadratic limb darkening law, and a realistic spot and plage contrast ratio.
SOAP 2.0 shows that the activity-induced variation of plages is dominated by
the inhibition of the convective blueshift effect. For spots, this effect
becomes significant only for slow rotators. In addition, in the case of a major
active region dominating the activity-induced signal, the ratio between the
full width at half maximum (FWHM) and the RV peak-to-peak amplitudes of the
cross correlation function can be used to infer the type of active region
responsible for the signal for stars with \vsini$\le8$\kms. A ratio smaller
than three implies a spot, while a larger ratio implies a plage. Using the
observation of HD189733, we show that SOAP 2.0 manages to reproduce the
activity variation as well as previous simulations when a spot is dominating
the activity-induced variation. In addition, SOAP 2.0 also reproduces the
activity variation induced by a plage on the slowly rotating star $\alpha$ Cen
B, which is not possible using previous simulations. Following these results,
SOAP 2.0 can be used to estimate the signal induced by spots and plages, but
also to correct for it when a major active region is dominating the RV
variation.

the Kanzaki forces and thereby to strongly non-pairwise long-range interaction.
The main advantage of the full configuration-dependent lattice deformation

of ordering striction and anharmonicity in Cu-Au and Fe-Pt alloys are assessed.
Although the harmonic force constants defined with respect to the unrelaxed
lattice are unsuitable for the calculation of the vibrational entropies, the
phonon spectra for ordered and disordered alloys are found to be in good
agreement with experimental data. The model is further adapted to concentration
wave analysis and Monte Carlo simulations by means of an auxiliary
multi-parametric real-space cluster expansion, which is used to find the
ordering temperatures. Good agreement with experiment is found for all systems

$\alpha\sim 67^\circ$, Alfv\'en speed $\beta_\mathrm{A}\sim 0.64$, and
magnetosonic Mach number $M_\mathrm{ms}\sim 4.7$. This describes a plasma in
which the magnetic field is dominant and in a rather tight helix, and Alfv\'en
waves are responsible for the moving transverse patterns.

statistic of $n$ given elements, in particular the classic deterministic
algorithm by grouping and partition due to Blum, Floyd, Pratt, Rivest, and
Tarjan (1973). Whereas the original algorithm uses groups of odd size at least
$5$ and runs in linear time, it has been perpetuated in the literature that
using smaller group sizes will force the worst-case running time to become
superlinear, namely $\Omega(n \log{n})$. We first point out that the usual
arguments found in the literature justifying the superlinear worst-case running
time fall short of proving this claim. We further prove that it is possible to
use group size smaller than $5$ while maintaining the worst case linear running
time. To this end we introduce three simple variants of the classic algorithm,
the repeated step algorithm, the shifting target algorithm, and the hyperpair
algorithm, all running in linear time.

definite integrals of the form $Z = \int L(x) d P(x)$, where $L$ is a target
function (often a likelihood) and $P$ a finite measure. We present
vertical-likelihood Monte Carlo, which is an approach for designing the
importance function $g(x)$ used in importance sampling. Our approach exploits a
duality between two random variables: the random draw $X \sim g$, and the
corresponding random likelihood ordinate $Y\equiv L(X)$ of the draw. It is
natural to specify $g(x)$ and ask: what is the the implied distribution of $Y$?
In this paper, we take up the opposite question: what should the distribution
of $Y$ be so that the implied importance function $g(x)$ is good for
approximating $Z$? Our answer turns out to unite seven seemingly disparate
classes of algorithms under the vertical-likelihood perspective: importance
sampling, slice sampling, simulated annealing/tempering, the harmonic-mean
estimator, the vertical-density sampler, nested sampling, and energy-level
sampling (a suite of related methods from statistical physics). In particular,
we give an alterate presentation of nested sampling, paying special attention
to the connection between this method and the vertical-likelihood perspective
articulated here. As an alternative to nested sampling, we describe an MCMC
method based on re-weighted slice sampling. This method's convergence
properties are studied, and two examples demonstrate the promise of the overall
approach.

the magnetic properties of neutron stars, making it impossible to generate the
chiral charge density needed to trigger a strong chiral magnetic instability
during the core collapse of supernovae. This instability has been proposed as a
plausible mechanism for generating extremely large helical magnetic fields in
neutron stars at their birth; the mechanism relies on the generation of a large
non-equilibrium chiral charge density via electron capture reactions that
selectively deplete left-handed electrons during core-collapse and the early
evolution of the protoneutron star. Our calculation shows that the electron
chirality violation rate induced by Rutherford scattering, despite being
suppressed by the smallness of the electron mass relative to the electron
chemical potential, is still fast compared to the weak interaction electron
capture rate. The resulting asymmetry between right and left-handed electron
densities is therefore never able to attain an astrophysically relevant
magnitude.

Artin algebras and commutative noetherian rings. Our study develops similarly
for these classes; for simplicity we only discuss the latter here.
  Stable homology is a broad generalization of Tate homology. Vanishing of
stable homology detects classes of rings---among them Gorenstein rings, the
original domain of Tate homology. Closely related to gorensteinness of rings is
Auslander's G-dimension for modules. We show that vanishing of stable homology
detects modules of finite G-dimension. This is the first characterization of
such modules in terms of vanishing of (co)homology alone.
  Stable homology, like absolute homology, Tor, is a theory in two variables.
It can be computed from a flat resolution of one module together with an
injective resolution of the other. This betrays that stable homology is not
balanced in the way Tor is balanced. In fact, we prove that a ring is
Gorenstein if and only if stable homology is balanced.

is fractional Brownian motion (fBm). In this work, we highlight the potentials

proposed recurrence network (RN) approach to fBm and related stochastic

application of RN analysis to fBm (Liu \textit{et al.,} Phys. Rev. E

disregarding the intrinsic non-stationarity of such processes. Complementarily,
we analyze some RN properties of the closely related stationary fractional
Gaussian noise (fGn) processes and find that the resulting network properties
are well-defined and behave as one would expect from basic conceptual
considerations. Our results demonstrate that RN analysis can indeed provide
meaningful results for stationary stochastic processes, given a proper
selection of its intrinsic methodological parameters, whereas it is prone to
fail to uniquely retrieve RN properties for non-stationary stochastic processes
like fBm.

longitude of the ascending node, Omega, the inclination, i, and the argument of
perihelion, omega --- of the Kreutz system's faint, dwarf sungrazers observed
only with the SOHO/STEREO coronagraphs; their published orbits were derived
using a parabolic, purely gravitational approximation. In a plot of i against
Omega the bright Kreutz sungrazers (such as C/1843 D1, C/1882 R1, C/1963 R1,
etc.) fit a curve of fixed apsidal orientation, whereas the dwarf members are
distributed along a curve that makes with the apsidal curve an angle of 15 deg.
The dwarf sungrazers' perihelion longitude is statistically invariable, but
their perihelion latitude increases systematically with Omega. We find that
this trend can be explained by a strong erosion-driven nongravitational
acceleration normal to the orbit plane, confirmed for several test dwarf Kreutz
sungrazers by orbital solutions with nongravitational terms incorporated
directly in the equations of motion on a condition of fixed apsidal
orientation. Proceeding in three steps, we first apply Marsden et al.'s
standard formalism, solving for the normal acceleration only, and eventually
relax additional constraints on the nongravitational law and the acceleration's
radial and transverse components. The resulting nongravitational accelerations
on the dwarf sungrazers exceed the maximum for catalogued comets in
nearly-parabolic orbits by up to three orders of magnitude, topping in
exceptional cases the Sun's gravitational acceleration! A mass-loss model
suggests that the dwarf sungrazers' nuclei fragment copiously and their
dimensions diminish rapidly near the Sun, implying the objects' imminent demise
shortly before they reach perihelion.

single, general context, showing that the conservation laws of linear and
angular momenta can be satisfied without the need for hidden entities, provided
that the Einstein-Laub laws of force and torque are used in place of the
standard Lorentz law. Einstein and Laub published their paper in 1908, but the
simplicity of the conventional Lorentz law overshadowed the subtle features of
their formulation which, at first sight, appears somewhat complicated. However,
that slight complication turns out to lead to subsequent advantages in light of
Shockley's discovery of hidden momentum, which occurred more than a decade
after Einstein had passed away. In this paper, we show how the Einstein-Laub
formalism handles the underlying problems associated with certain paradoxes of
classical electrodynamics involving a static distribution of electric charges
and a magnet whose magnetization slowly fades away in time. The Einstein-Laub
laws of electromagnetic force and torque treat these paradoxes with elegance

holes doped into a CuO$_2$ layer. To simplify this task it is customary to
replace three-band models \cite{Emery} describing the doping holes as entering
the O $2p$ orbitals of these charge-transfer insulators \cite{ZSA} with much

this approach, showing that not only is the dynamics of a doped hole easier to
understand in models that explicitly include the O orbitals, but also that our
solution contradicts the long-held belief that the quantum spin fluctuations of
the antiferromagnetic (AFM) background play a key role in determining this
dynamics. Indeed, we show that the correct, experimentally observed dispersion
is generically obtained for a hole moving on the O sublattice, and coupled to a
N\'eel lattice of spins without spin fluctuations. This marks a significant
conceptual change in our understanding of the relevant phenomenology and opens
the way to studying few-holes dynamics without finite-size effect issues

a conductive membrane patch with clamped boundary, the pressure-induced surface
deformation results in a change in the conductivity distribution. This change
can be detected in the current-voltage data ({\it i.e.,} EIT data) measured on
the boundary of the membrane patch. Hence, the corresponding inverse problem is
to reconstruct the pressure distribution from the data. The 2D apparent
conductivity (in terms of EIT data) corresponding to the surface deformation is
anisotropic. Thus, we consider a constrained inverse problem by restricting the
coefficient tensor to the range of the map from pressure to 2D-apparent
conductivity. This paper provides theoretical grounds for the mathematical
model of the inverse problem. We develop a reconstruction algorithm based on a
careful sensitivity analysis. We demonstrate the performance of the

show that such switching can also be achieved between any two multidomain

popular for various applications. This problem is still highly challenging as
current methods are generally slow in speed and sensitive to outliers. To
address the above two issues, we propose an accelerated robust subset selection
(ARSS) method. Specifically in the subset selection area, this is the first
attempt to employ the $\ell_{p}(0<p\leq1)$-norm based measure for the
representation loss, preventing large errors from dominating our objective. As
a result, the robustness against outlier elements is greatly enhanced.
Actually, data size is generally much larger than feature length, i.e. $N\gg
L$. Based on this observation, we propose a speedup solver (via ALM and
equivalent derivations) to highly reduce the computational cost, theoretically
from $O(N^{4})$ to $O(N{}^{2}L)$. Extensive experiments on ten benchmark
datasets verify that our method not only outperforms state of the art methods,
but also runs 10,000+ times faster than the most related method.

$B$-mode polarization at degree angular scales has indicated the presence of

scale-invariant tensor and scalar spectra, although the signal may be
contaminated by dust emission as implied by the recent {\em Planck}

Lambda Cold Dark Model with $r<0.11$. Due to the fact that inflaton has to be
interacting with other fields so as to convert its potential energy into
radiation to reheat the Universe, the interacting inflaton may result in a
suppression of the scalar spectrum at large scales. This suppression has been
used to explain the observed low quadrupole in the CMB anisotropy. In this
paper, we show that a combination of the tensor modes measured by BICEP2 and
the large-scale suppressed scalar modes contributes to the CMB anisotropy in
such a way that the resultant CMB anisotropy and polarization power spectra are
consistent with both {\em Planck} and BICEP2 data. We also project our findings

outcomes of local measurements of a multipartite physical system. No-signaling
boxes are the abstract objects for studying non-locality, and wirings are local
operations on the space of no-signaling boxes. This means that, no matter how
non-local the nature is, the set of physical non-local correlations must be
closed under wirings. Then, one approach to identify the non-locality of nature
is to characterize closed sets of non-local correlations. Although non-trivial
examples of wirings of no-signaling boxes are known, there is no systematic way
to study wirings. In particular, given a set of no-signaling boxes, we do not
know a general method to prove that it is closed under wirings. In this paper,
we propose the first general method to construct such closed sets of non-local
correlations. We show that a well-known measure of correlation, called maximal
correlation, when appropriately defined for non-local correlations, is
monotonically decreasing under wirings.
  This establishes a conjecture about the impossibility of simulating isotropic
boxes from each other, implying the existence of a continuum of closed sets of
non-local boxes under wirings. To prove our main result, we introduce some
mathematical tools that may be of independent interest: we define a notion of
maximal correlation ribbon as a generalization of maximal correlation, and
provide a connection between it and a known object called hypercontractivity
ribbon; we show that these two ribbons are monotone under wirings too.

prescribed steps confined to the positive quadrant. The classification is now
complete for walks with steps in $\{0, \pm 1\}^2$: the generating function is
D-finite if and only if a certain group associated with the step set is finite.
  We explore in this paper the analogous problem for 3-dimensional walks
confined to the positive octant. The first difficulty is their number: there
are 11074225 non-trivial and non-equivalent step sets in $\{0, \pm 1\}^3$
(instead of 79 in the quadrant case). We focus on the 35548 that have at most
six steps.
  We apply to them a combined approach, first experimental and then rigorous.
On the experimental side, we try to guess differential equations. We also try
to determine if the associated group is finite. The largest finite groups that
we find have order 48 -- the larger ones have order at least 200 and we believe
them to be infinite. No differential equation has been detected in those cases.
  On the rigorous side, we apply three main techniques to prove D-finiteness.
The algebraic kernel method, applied earlier to quadrant walks, works in many
cases. Certain, more challenging, cases turn out to have a special Hadamard
structure, which allows us to solve them via a reduction to problems of smaller
dimension. Finally, for two special cases, we had to resort to computer algebra
proofs. We prove with these techniques all the guessed differential equations.
  This leaves us with exactly 19 very intriguing step sets for which the group
is finite, but the nature of the generating function still unclear.

does not scatter light efficiently. It is hence difficult to detect a very
small object with light. We show using analytic theory as well as full wave
numerical calculation that the effective polarizability of a small cylinder can
be greatly enhanced by coupling it with a superlens type metamaterial slab.
This kind of enhancement is not due to the individual resonance effect of the
metamaterial slab, nor due to that of the object, but is caused by a collective
resonant mode between the cylinder and the slab. We show that this type of
particle-slab resonance which makes a small two-dimensional object much
brighter is actually closely related to the reverse effect known in the
literature as cloaking by anomalous resonance which can make a small cylinder
undetectable. We also show that the enhancement of polarizability can lead to
strongly enhanced electromagnetic forces that can be attractive or repulsive,
depending on the material properties of the cylinder.

by step, the evolution of the spectrum and of the trajectory of the radio

flux range for the EBL, which is independent of previous estimates. The
observed VHE spectrum of the sources in our sample can be well approximated by
a power-law, and if the de-absorbed spectrum is also assumed to be a power law,
then we show that the spectral shape of EBL will be $\epsilon n(\epsilon) \sim

parameters defining the EBL spectrum, $k$ and $\epsilon_p$, such that the
correlation of the intrinsic VHE spectrum with redshift is nullified. The
estimated EBL depends only on the observed correlation and the assumption of a
power law source spectrum. Specifically, it does not depend on the spectral
modeling or radiative mechanism of the sources, nor does it depend on any
theoretical shape of the EBL spectrum obtained through cosmological
calculations. The estimated EBL spectrum is consistent with the upper and lower
limits imposed by different observations. Moreover, it also agrees closely with

taking advantage of the global expression of the DG method and re-expanding it
in terms of a multiwavelet basis, which is a sum of the global average and
finer details on different levels. Examining the higher level difference
coefficients acts as a troubled-cell indicator, thus avoiding unnecessary
increased computational cost of a new expansion. In two-dimensions the
multiwavelet decomposition uses combinations of scaling functions and
multiwavelets in the x- and y-directions for improved troubled-cell indication.
By using such a troubled-cell indicator, we are able to reduce the

  its internal vertices","15 pages, 1 figure",,,,"cs.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper focuses on finding a spanning tree of a graph to maximize the
number of its internal vertices. We present an approximation algorithm for this
problem which can achieve a performance ratio $\frac{4}{3}$ on undirected
simple graphs. This improves upon the best known approximation algorithm with
performance ratio $\frac{5}{3}$ before. Our algorithm benefits from a new
observation for bounding the number of internal vertices of a spanning tree,
which reveals that a spanning tree of an undirected simple graph has less
internal vertices than the edges a maximum path-cycle cover of that graph has.
We can also give an example to show that the performance ratio $\frac{4}{3}$ is
actually tight for this algorithm. To decide how difficult it is for this
problem to be approximated, we show that finding a spanning tree of an
undirected simple graph to maximize its internal vertices is Max-SNP-Hard.

They can be extracted from Compton-scattering data --- and have been, with good
accuracy, in the case of the proton. In contradistinction, information for the
neutron requires the use of Compton scattering from nuclear targets. Here we
report a new measurement of elastic photon scattering from deuterium using
quasimonoenergetic tagged photons at the MAX IV Laboratory in Lund, Sweden.
These first new data in more than a decade effectively double the world
dataset. Their energy range overlaps with previous experiments and extends it
by 20 MeV to higher energies. An analysis using Chiral Effective Field Theory
with dynamical \Delta(1232) degrees of freedom shows the data are consistent
with and within the world dataset. After demonstrating that the fit is
consistent with the Baldin sum rule, extracting values for the isoscalar
nucleon polarizabilities and combining them with a recent result for the

timescales as short as hours. In some sources, dramatic spectral and flux
changes suggest interplay between a relativistic jet and the accretion disk.
The estimated masses of the central black holes are in the range $\sim
10^{6-8}M_{\odot}$, smaller than those of blazars, while the accretion
luminosities span a range from $\sim 0.01$ to $\sim 0.49$ times the Eddington
limit, similar to those of quasars. The distribution of the calculated jet
power spans a range from $\sim 10^{42.6}$ to $\sim 10^{45.6}$ erg s$^{-1}$,
generally lower than quasars and BL Lac objects, but partially overlapping with
the latter. Once normalised by the mass of the central black holes, the jet
power of the three types of active galactic nuclei are consistent with each
other, indicating the scalability of the jet. Despite the observational
differences, the central engine of RLNLS1s is apparently quite similar to that
of blazars. The historical difficulties in finding radio-loud narrow-line
Seyfert 1 galaxies might be due to their low power and to intermittent jet
activity.

165 spectra of SGPs are mined out from Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Data
Release 9 (DR9) using the concept of membership degree from the fuzzy set
theory particularly defined to be suitable for fuzzily identifying emission
lines. The spectra and images of this sample are classified according to the
membership degree and their image features, respectively. Many of these 2nd
redshift systems are too small or too dim to select from the SDSS images alone,
making the sample a potentially unique source of information on dust effects in
low-luminosity or low-surface-brightness galaxies that are underrepresented in
morphological pair samples. The dust extinction of the objects with high
membership degree is also estimated by Balmer decrement. Additionally, analyses
for a series of spectroscopic observations of one SGP from 165 systems indicate
that a newly star-forming region of our Milky Way might occur.

an alternative route to this problem, which is motivated by the tremendous
progress in first-principles materials physics in general and ab initio

Lorentz-covariant first-order response law, which is written in terms of the
fundamental response tensor $\chi^\mu_\nu$ relating induced four-currents to
external four-potentials. By showing the equivalence of this description to
Ohm's law, we prove the validity of Ohm's law in every inertial frame. We
further use the universal relation between $\chi^\mu_\nu$ and the microscopic
conductivity tensor $\sigma_{k\ell}$ to derive a fully relativistic
transformation law for the latter, which includes all effects of anisotropy and
relativistic retardation. In the special case of a constant, scalar
conductivity, this transformation law can be used to rederive a standard
textbook generalization of Ohm's law.

multiwavelength photon spectra and the observed variability in the optical,
X-ray, and TeV gamma-ray energy bands of blazar PKS 2155-304 while being in a
low state between 25 August and 6 September 2008. We consider three emission
models, i.e. a one-component synchrotron self-Compton model (1-SSC), a one-zone
proton synchrotron model (LHs), and a two-component SSC model (2-SSC). Only in
the first scenario can the emission from the optical up to TeV gamma-rays be
attributed to a single particle population from one emission region. Using a
time-dependent numerical code that solves the kinetic equations for each
particle species, we derived, in all cases, acceptable fits to the
time-averaged SED. By imposing variations to one (or more) model parameters
according to observed variability pattern in one (or more) frequencies we
calculated the respective light curves and compared them with the observations.
We show that the 1-SSC model cannot account for the anticorrelation observed
between the X-rays and VHE gamma-rays, although it can explain the
time-averaged SED. The anticorrelation can be more naturally explained by the
two-component emission models. Both of them reproduce satisfactorily the
optical, X-ray, and TeV variability but at the cost of additional free
parameters, which from four in the 2-SSC model increase to six in the LHs
model. Although the results of our time-resolved analysis do not favour one of
the aforementioned models, they suggest that a two-component scenario is more
adequate for the emission of PKS 2155-304 in the low state of 2008, which
agrees with a recent independent analysis. This suggests that the quiescent
blazar radiation might result from a superposition of the radiation from
different components, while a flare might still be the result of a single
component.

supermassive black hole (SMBH) can give rise to spectral features of iron in
6-7 keV X-ray signal: a relativistic line profile emerges from debris
illuminated and ionised by an intense flash produced from the destroyed star.
This could provide a unique way to determine parameters of the system. We
consider a model where the nuclear stellar population acquires an oblate shape
(i.e., a flattened distribution) in the inner region near a supermassive black
hole, and also the primary irradiation flare is expected to occur more likely
near the equatorial plane, co-planar with the infalling material. This suggests
that the reprocessing of primary X-rays results in a transient profile that
should be relevant for tidal-disruption events (TDE) in otherwise
under-luminous (inactive) galactic nuclei, i.e. with no prior accretion disc.
Resonance mechanisms of the stellar motion can increase the orbital
eccentricity for some stars in the nuclear cluster and help to bring them close
to the tidal radius, where they can give rise to TDEs. The proposed scenario
appears to be distinguishably different from the standard scheme of lamp-post
model for the origin of the relativistic line in active galaxies, where the
source is thought to be located predominantly near the symmetry axis.

extensive array of methods that have been proposed in the machine learning
literature for convex optimization. In this paper, we address this crucial gap
by proposing two proximal gradient methods (CONCORD-ISTA and CONCORD-FISTA) for
performing $\ell_1$-regularized inverse covariance matrix estimation in the
pseudo-likelihood framework. We present timing comparisons with coordinate-wise
minimization and demonstrate that our approach yields tremendous payoffs for
$\ell_1$-penalized partial correlation graph estimation outside the Gaussian
setting, thus yielding the fastest and most scalable approach for such
problems. We undertake a theoretical analysis of our approach and rigorously
demonstrate convergence, and also derive rates thereof.

3 arcmin to the south-east from Bruck 88. We obtained for the cluster the same

arccos(sqrt(1/(2k-2))) in R^(2k-1) is equal to 2k-1. The solution of this
geometric problem is obtained by the construction of complex conference

  Storage Rings",,,,,"physics.acc-ph math-ph math.MP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  With this paper we extend our studies [1] on polarized beams by distilling
tools from the theory of principal bundles. Four major theorems are presented,
one which ties invariant fields with the notion of normal form, one which
allows one to compare different invariant fields, and two that relate the
existence of invariant fields to the existence of certain invariant sets and
relations between them. We then apply the theory to the dynamics of spin-1/2
and spin-1 particles and their density matrices describing statistically the
particle-spin content of bunches. Our approach thus unifies the spin-vector
dynamics from the T-BMT equation with the spin-tensor dynamics and other
dynamics. This unifying aspect of our approach relates the examples elegantly
and uncovers relations between the various underlying dynamical systems in a
transparent way.

dimensionally reduced supermultiplets provide information about Lorentz
transformations in the higher-dimensional spacetime from which the 0-brane

locally interacting dynamical systems. Central to our approach is a novel
spatial superposition logic, whose semantics is defined over the quad-tree of a
partitioned image. We show that formulas in this logic can be efficiently
learned from positive and negative examples of several types of patterns. We
also demonstrate that pattern detection, which is implemented as a model
checking algorithm, performs very well for test data sets different from the
learning sets. We define a quantitative semantics for the logic and integrate
the model checking algorithm with particle swarm optimization in a
computational framework for synthesis of parameters leading to desired patterns
in reaction-diffusion systems.

macroscopic objects, such as for trapping or cooling, or whether arising from
the quantum and thermal fluctuations of charges in otherwise neutral bodies,
leading to unwanted stiction between nearby mechanical parts, electromagnetic
interactions play a fundamental role in many naturally occurring processes and
technologies. In this review, we survey recent progress in the understanding
and experimental observation of optomechanical and quantum-fluctuation forces.
Although both of these effects arise from exchange of electromagnetic momentum,
their dramatically different origins, involving either real or virtual photons,
lead to different physical manifestations and design principles. Specifically,
we describe recent predictions and measurements of attractive and repulsive
optomechanical forces, based on the bonding and antibonding interactions of
evanescent waves, as well as predictions of modified and even repulsive Casimir
forces between nanostructured bodies. Finally, we discuss the potential impact
and interplay of these forces in emerging experimental regimes of
micromechanical devices.

of hyperbolic periodic orbits grows exponentially with respect to the period.
We show that for an infinite family of 3-manifolds, infinitely many different
contact structures exist that possess a pair of Legendrian knots for which the
