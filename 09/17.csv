space dimension, which are induced by shell models of turbulence. After Fourier
transformation, such continuous models split into an infinite number of
uncoupled subsystems, which are all identical to the same shell model. The two
shell models, which allow such a construction, are considered: the dyadic
(Desnyansky--Novikov) model with the intershell ratio $\lambda = 2^{3/2}$ and
the Sabra model of turbulence with $\lambda = \sqrt{2+\sqrt{5}} \approx 2.058$.
The continuous models allow understanding various properties of shell model
solutions and provide their interpretation in physical space. We show that the
asymptotic solutions of the dyadic model with Kolmogorov scaling correspond to
the shocks (discontinuities) for the induced continuous solutions in physical
space, and the finite-time blowup together with its viscous regularization
follow the scenario similar to the Burgers equation. For the Sabra model, we
provide the physical space representation for blowup solutions and intermittent
turbulent dynamics.

turns out that standard statistical techniques, such as the maximum likelihood

be stable. Due to this shortcoming, we introduce and analyse a novel inference
procedure for parameters in stochastic differential equation models which turns
out to be convergent. As such, the method is particularly suited for the

self-annihilation of super-symmetric dark matter particles. In this work we
discuss the general properties of the radio emission expected in a wide range
of dark matter halos, from local dwarf spheroidal galaxies to large and distant
galaxy clusters with the aim to determine the neutralino dark matter detection
prospects of the Square Kilometre Array (SKA). The analysis of the SKA
detection of dark matter(DM)-induced radio emission is presented for structures
spanning a wide range of masses and redshifts, and we also analyze the limits
that the SKA can set on the thermally averaged neutralino annihilation
cross-section in the event of non-detection. To this aim, we construct a model
of the redshift evolution of the radio emissions of dark matter halos and apply
it to generate predicted fluxes from a range of neutralino masses and
annihilation channels for the dark matter halos surrounding dwarf galaxies,
galaxies and galaxy clusters. Using the available SKA performance predictions
and its ability to determine an independent measure of the magnetic field in
cosmic structures, we explore both the detailed detection prospects and the
upper-bounds that might be placed on the neutralino annihilation cross-section
in the event of non-detection. We find that the SKA can access a neutralino
parameter space far larger than that of any preceding indirect-detection
experiment, also improving on the realistic CTA detection prospects, with the
possibility of setting cross-section upper-bounds up to four orders of
magnitude below the thermal relic density bound. Additionally, we find that
neutralino radio emissions carry redshift-independent signatures of the
dominant annihilation channel and of neutralino mass, offering therefore a
means to identify such non-thermal emissions within the observing frequency
range of the SKA.

also in the case of Einstein-Yang-Mills theory in $d$ dimensions with and
without a cosmological constant. The first part of this thesis is devoted to
the presentation of asymptotic methods (symmetries, solution space and surface
charges) applied to gravity in the case of the BMS gauge in three and four
spacetime dimensions. The second part of this thesis contains the original
contributions. Firstly, it is shown that the enhancement from Lorentz to
Virasoro algebra also occurs for asymptotically flat spacetimes defined in the
sense of Newman-Unti. As a first application, the transformation laws of the
Newman-Penrose coefficients characterizing solution space of the Newman-Unti
approach are worked out, focusing on the inhomogeneous terms that contain the
information about central extensions of the theory. These transformations laws
make the conformal structure particularly transparent, and constitute the main
original result of the thesis. Secondly, asymptotic symmetries of the
Einstein-Yang-Mills system with or without cosmological constant are explicitly
worked out in a unified manner in $d$ dimensions. In agreement with a recent
conjecture, a Virasoro-Kac-Moody type algebra is found not only in three
dimensions but also in the four dimensional asymptotically flat case. These two
parts of the thesis are supplemented by appendices.

key importance to constrain the different candidates for intra-cluster

large range of elements in the globular cluster 47 Tucanae (NGC 104) to add new
constraints to the pollution scenarios for this particular cluster, expanding
the range of previously derived element abundances. Methods: Using tailored 1D
LTE atmospheric models together with a combination of equivalent width
measurements, LTE, and NLTE synthesis we derive stellar parameters and element
abundances from high-resolution, high signal-to-noise spectra of 13 red giant
stars near the tip of the RGB. Results: We derive abundances of a total 27
elements (O, Na, Mg, Al, Si, Ca, Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Y, Zr,
Mo, Ru, Ba, La, Ce, Pr, Nd, Eu, Dy). Departures from LTE were taken into
account for Na, Al and Ba. We find a mean [Fe/H] = $-0.78\pm0.07$ and
$[\alpha/{\rm Fe}]=0.34\pm0.03$ in good agreement with previous studies. The
remaining elements show good agreement with the literature, but the inclusion
of NLTE for Al has a significant impact on the behaviour of this key element.
Conclusions: We confirm the presence of an Na-O anti-correlation in 47 Tucanae
found by several other works. Our NLTE analysis of Al shifts the [Al/Fe] to
lower values, indicating that this may be overestimated in earlier works. No
evidence for an intrinsic variation is found in any of the remaining elements.

to efficiently export toxic molecules from inside the developing embryo. For
aquatic microorganisms, the strategies employed should be robust with respect
to the variable ocean environment and limit the chances that exported toxins
are reabsorbed. As a result, the problem of toxin export is closely related to
the physics of mass transport in a fluid. In this paper we consider a model
first-passage problem for the uptake of exported toxins by a spherical embryo.
By considering how macroscale fluid turbulence manifests itself on the
microscale of the embryo, we determine that fluid flow enhances the
effectiveness of toxin export as compared to the case of diffusion-limited
transport. In the regime of large P\'eclet number, a perturbative solution of
the advection-diffusion equation reveals that a concentration boundary layer
forms at the surface of the embryo. The model results suggest a functional role
for cell surface roughness in the export process, with the thickness of the
concentration boundary layer setting the length scale for cell membrane
protrusions known as microvilli. We highlight connections between the model
results and experiments on the development of sea urchin embryos.

resulting from targeted selection but an instance of exaptation because
selection cannot act on situations that are only encountered once. In
exaptation, a trait that originally evolved to solve one problem is co-opted to
solve a new problem; thus the trait or traits in question must be necessary and
sufficient to solve the new problem. Sol claims that traits such as persistence
and neophilia, are necessary and sufficient for animal innovation, which is a
matter of trial and error. We suggest that this explanation does not extend to
human innovation, which involves strategy, logic, intuition, and insight, and
requires traits that evolved, not as a byproduct of some other function, but
for the purpose of coming up with adaptive responses to environmental
variability itself. We point to an agent based model that indicates the
feasibility of two such proposed traits: (1) chaining, the ability to construct
complex thoughts from simple ones, and (2) contextual focus, the ability to
shift between convergent and divergent modes of thought. We agree that there is
a sense in which innovation is exaptation--it occurs when an existing object or
behaviour is adapted to new needs or tastes--and refer to a mathematical model
of biological and cultural exaltation. We conclude that much is gained by
comparing and contrasting animal and human innovation.

resulting numerics for a new definition of strength of connection which is
based on the notion of algebraic distance. This algebraic distance measure,
combined with compatible relaxation, is used to choose suitable coarse grids
and accurate interpolation operators for algebraic multigrid algorithms. The
main tool of the proposed measure is the least squares functional defined using
a set of relaxed test vectors. The motivating application is the anisotropic
diffusion problem, in particular problems with non-grid aligned anisotropy. We
demonstrate numerically that the measure yields a robust technique for
determining strength of connectivity among variables, for both two-grid and
multigrid solvers. %We illustrate the use of the measure to construct, in
addition, an adaptive aggregation form of interpolation for the targeted
anisotropic problems. %Our approach is not a two-level approach -- we provide
preliminary results that show its extendability to multigrid. The proposed
algebraic distance measure can also be used in any other coarsening procedure,
assuming a rich enough set of the near-kernel components of the matrix for the
targeted system is known or computed.

initial states of a perturbative expansion, replacing the conventional free
$in$ and $out$ states. The coupling freezes at $\alpha_s(0)\simeq 0.5$,
allowing reasonable convergence. The \order{\alpha_s^0} bound states have a sea
of $q\bar q$ pairs, while transverse gluons contribute only at
\order{\alpha_s}. Pair creation in the linear $A^0$ potential leads to string
breaking and hadron loop corrections. These corrections give finite widths to
excited states, as required by unitarity. Several of these features have been

cosmological perturbation theory -- a powerful technique for modelling
inhomogeneities in the Universe. The common theme which underpins these pieces
of work is the presence of non-adiabatic pressure, or entropy, perturbations.
After a brief introduction covering the standard techniques of describing
inhomogeneities in both Newtonian and relativistic cosmology, I discuss the
generation of vorticity. As in classical fluid mechanics, vorticity is not
present in linearized perturbation theory (unless included as an initial
condition). Allowing for entropy perturbations, and working to second order in
perturbation theory, I show that vorticity is generated, even in the absence of
vector perturbations, by purely scalar perturbations, the source term being
quadratic in the gradients of first order energy density and isocurvature, or
non-adiabatic pressure perturbations. This generalizes Crocco's theorem to a
cosmological setting. I then introduce isocurvature perturbations in different
models, focusing on the entropy perturbation in standard, concordance
cosmology, and in inflationary models involving two scalar fields. As the final
topic, I investigate magnetic fields, which are a potential observational
consequence of vorticity in the early universe. I briefly review some recent
work on including magnetic fields in perturbation theory in a consistent way. I
show, using solely analytical techniques, that magnetic fields can be generated
by higher order perturbations, albeit too small to provide the entire
primordial seed field, in agreement with some numerical studies. I close with a
summary and some potential extensions of this work.

variables in a cluster algebra. We also give two rephrasings of this recursion:
one as a duality formula for d-vectors in the style of the g-vectors/c-vectors
dualities of Nakanishi and Zelevinsky, and one as a formula expressing the
highest powers in the Laurent expansion of a cluster variable in terms of the
d-vectors of any cluster containing it. We prove that the initial-seed-mutation
recursion holds in a varied collection of cluster algebras, but not in general.
We conjecture further that the formula holds for source-sink moves on the
initial seed in an arbitrary cluster algebra, and we prove this conjecture in
the case of surfaces.

be seen as a decoupling between the real and model geometry. The result applies
also to Suzuki (Rayleigh-log-normal) propagation model. We use

quasiparticles and an ""incoherent background"" that can accommodate broad,

presence of an eavesdropper who must be kept ignorant of transmitted messages.
The performance of such a system is usually characterized by its secrecy
capacity which determines the maximum transmission rate of secure
communication. In this paper, the issue of whether or not the secrecy capacity
is a continuous function of the system parameters is examined. In particular,
this is done for channel uncertainty modeled via compound channels and
arbitrarily varying channels, in which the legitimate users know only that the
true channel realization is from a pre-specified uncertainty set. In the former
model, this realization remains constant for the entire duration of
transmission, while in the latter the realization varies from channel use to
channel use in an unknown and arbitrary manner. These models not only capture
the case of channel uncertainty, but are also suitable for modeling scenarios
in which a malicious adversary jams or otherwise influence the legitimate
transmission. The secrecy capacity of the compound wiretap channel is shown to
be robust in the sense that it is a continuous function of the uncertainty set.
Thus, small variations in the uncertainty set lead to small variations in
secrecy capacity. On the other hand, the deterministic secrecy capacity of the
\emph{arbitrarily varying wiretap channel} is shown to be discontinuous in the
uncertainty set meaning that small variations can lead to dramatic losses in
capacity.

in the range 8.5 < log(M*/Msun) < 10. This paper is a data release and initial
analysis of the first two semesters of observations, consisting of 42 galaxies
observed in CO(2-1). By combining these new CO(2-1) emission line data with
archival HI data and SDSS optical spectroscopy, we compile a sample of low-mass
galaxies with well defined molecular gas masses, atomic gas masses, and
gas-phase metallicities. We explore scaling relations of gas fraction and gas
consumption timescale, and test the extent to which our findings are dependent
on a varying CO/H2 conversion factor. We find an increase in the H2/HI mass
ratio with stellar mass which closely matches semi-analytic predictions. We
find a mean molecular gas fraction for ALLSMOG galaxies of MH2/M* = (0.09 -
0.13), which decreases with stellar mass. We measure a mean molecular gas
consumption timescale for ALLSMOG galaxies of 0.4 - 0.7 Gyr. We also confirm
the non-universality of the molecular gas consumption timescale, which varies
(with stellar mass) from ~100 Myr to ~2 Gyr. Importantly, we find that the
trends in the H2/HI mass ratio, gas fraction, and the non-universal molecular
gas consumption timescale are all robust to a range of recent
metallicity-dependent CO/H2 conversion factors.

practice of using ""cold"" initial conditions no longer a simple choice of
convenience. The choice of initial virial temperature must be carefully
considered as its impact on the remainder of the simulation can be profound. We
discuss the pitfalls and aim to describe the general behavior of the collapse
and the resultant system as a function of the virial temperature so that a well
reasoned choice of initial virial temperature can be made. We make a correction
to the previous theoretical estimate for the minimum radius, $R_{min}$, of the

$R_{min}\approx Q + N^{(-1/3)}$, where $N$ is the number of particles.

formed with a rather cool, but not cold, initial virial temperature ($Q\approx

early-type dwarf galaxies in the magnitude range $16.0 < m_{F814W} < 22.6 $
mag, corresponding to $-19.0 < M_{F814W} < -12.4 $ mag.
  Nuclear star clusters are detected in 80% of the galaxies, thus doubling the
sample of HST-observed early-type dwarf galaxies with nuclear star clusters.
\changed{We confirm that the} nuclear star cluster detection fraction decreases
strongly toward faint magnitudes. The luminosities of nuclear star clusters do
not scale linearly with host galaxy luminosity. A linear fit yields L$_{nuc}
\sim $L$_{gal}^{0.57\pm0.05}$. The nuclear star cluster-host galaxy luminosity
scaling relation for low-mass early-type dwarf galaxies is consistent with
formation by globular cluster accretion. We find that at similar luminosities,
galaxies with higher S\'ersic indices have slightly more luminous nuclear star
clusters. Rounder galaxies have on average more luminous clusters.
  Some of the nuclear star clusters are resolved, despite the distance of Coma.
We argue that the relation between nuclear star cluster mass and size is
consistent with both formation by globular cluster accretion and in situ
formation.
  Our data are consistent with GC inspiraling being the dominant mechanism at
low masses, although the observed trend with S\'ersic index suggests that in
situ star formation is an important second order effect.

we expand on the results of that work, investigating the star formation and
chemical evolution of the system beyond the first supernova. In a galaxy with a
mass $M_{vir} = 10^7$M$_\odot$, sufficient gas is retained by the potential for
a second period of star formation to occur. The impact of a central explosion
is found to be much stronger than that of an off-centred explosion both in
blowing out the gas and in enriching it, as in the off-centered case most of
the supernova energy and metals escape into the IGM. We model the star
formation and metallicity given the assumption that stars form for 100, 200,
400 and 600 Myr and discuss the results in the context of recent observations
of very low mass galaxies. We show that we can account for most features of the

histories (SFHs) from the fossil record of Local Group galaxies are used to
reconstruct the LF down to M$_{UV}\sim-5$ at $z\sim5$ and M$_{UV}\sim-1.5$ at
$z<1$. Such faint limits are well beyond the current observational limits and
are likely to remain beyond the limits of next generation facilities. The
reconstructed LFs, when combined with direct measurements of the LFs at higher
luminosity, are well-fit by a standard Schechter function with no evidence of a
break to the faintest limits probed by this technique. The derived faint end
slope, $\alpha$, steepens from $\approx-1.2$ at $z<1$ to $\approx-1.6$ at
$4<z<5$. We test the effects of burstiness in the SFHs and find the recovered
LFs to be only modestly affected. Incompleteness corrections for the faintest
Local Group galaxies and the (unlikely) possibility of significant
luminosity-dependent destruction of dwarf galaxies between high redshift and
the present epoch are important uncertainties. These and other uncertainties
can be mitigated with more detailed modeling and future observations. The

relativistic effects, and the errors associated with incomplete knowledge of
telescope position, timing, and stellar position and motion. We note that
chromatic aberration will create uncertainties in the time of observation,

high-resolution follow-up observations that have identified seven previously

order Sachs-Wolfe formula in the squeezed limit to include a gradient in the
long mode and to account for the change in the location of the last scattering
surface induced by this mode. Next, we consider effects that are of second

quadrupole moment. For instance, in a matter-dominated model it is equal to
$Q=5 (\boldsymbol q\cdot \boldsymbol x)^2 /18$. This quadrupole can be canceled
by superposition of a quadratic perturbation. The result is shown to be a
nonlinear extension of Weinberg's adiabatic modes: a long-wavelength physical

The integrator is based on a Gau\ss-Radau quadrature and can handle

that can automatically choose an optimal timestep. The algorithm can handle
close encounters and high-eccentricity orbits. The systematic errors are kept
well below machine precision and long-term orbit integrations over $10^9$
orbits show that IAS15 is optimal in the sense that it follows Brouwer's law,
i.e. the energy error behaves like a random walk. Our tests show that IAS15 is
superior to a mixed-variable symplectic integrator (MVS) and other popular
integrators, including high-order ones, in both speed and accuracy. In fact,
IAS15 preserves the symplecticity of Hamiltonian systems better than the
commonly-used nominally symplectic integrators to which we compared it.
  We provide an open-source implementation of IAS15. The package comes with
several easy-to-extend examples involving resonant planetary systems,
Kozai-Lidov cycles, close encounters, radiation pressure, quadrupole moment,

neutrino-driven explosions in 3D, it has been proposed that asphericities
caused by convection in the progenitor might facilitate shock revival by
boosting the activity of non-radial hydrodynamic instabilities in the
post-shock region. We investigate this scenario in depth using 42 relativistic
2D simulations with multi-group neutrino transport to examine the effects of
velocity and density perturbations in the progenitor for different perturbation
geometries that obey fundamental physical constraints (like the anelastic
condition). As a framework for analysing our results, we introduce
semi-empirical scaling laws relating neutrino heating, average turbulent
velocities in the gain region, and the shock deformation in the saturation
limit of non-radial instabilities. The squared turbulent Mach number, <Ma^2>,
reflects the violence of aspherical motions in the gain layer, and explosive
runaway occurs for <Ma^2>~0.3, corresponding to a reduction of the critical
neutrino luminosity by ~25% compared to 1D. In the light of this theory,
progenitor asphericities aid shock revival mainly by creating anisotropic mass
flux onto the shock: Differential infall efficiently converts velocity
perturbations in the progenitor into density perturbations (Delta rho/rho) at
the shock of the order of the initial convective Mach number Ma. The
anisotropic mass flux and ram pressure deform the shock and thereby amplify
post-shock turbulence. Large-scale (l=2,l=1) modes prove most conducive to
shock revival, whereas small-scale perturbations require unrealistically high
convective Mach numbers. Initial density perturbations in the progenitor are
only of order Ma^2 and therefore play a subdominant role.

any given galaxy, the red regions are found to have higher stellar mass surface
densities and older ages compared to the blue regions. Furthermore, we quantify
the spatial distribution of red and blue regions with respect to both redshift

the centers of galaxies is not a significant function of either redshift or
stellar mass. We find that the ""main sequence"" of star forming galaxies exists
among both red and blue regions inside galaxies, with the median of blue
regions forming a tighter relation with a slope of 1.1+/-0.1 and a scatter of
~0.2 dex compared to red regions with a slope of 1.3+/-0.1 and a scatter of

an unknown sample from scattering intensities, measured for example under
illumination with coherent X-rays. By incorporating refraction, this method
yields improved contrast compared to purely absorption-based radiography but
involves a phase retrieval problem which, in general, allows for ambiguous
reconstructions. In this paper, we show uniqueness of propagation-based phase
contrast imaging for compactly supported objects in the near field regime,
based on a description by the projection- and paraxial approximations. In this
setting, propagation is governed by the Fresnel propagator and the unscattered
part of the illumination function provides a known reference wave at the
detector which facilitates phase reconstruction. The uniqueness theorem is
derived using the theory of entire functions. Unlike previous results based on
exact solution formulae, it is valid for arbitrary complex objects and requires
intensity measurements only at a single detector distance and illumination wave
length. We also deduce a uniqueness criterion for phase contrast tomography,
which may be applied to resolve the three-dimensional structure of micro- and
nano-scale samples. Moreover, our results may have some significance to
electronic imaging methods due to the equivalence of paraxial wave propagation
and Schr\""odinger's equation.

the concepts of electromagnetic field, force, energy and momentum, which are
intimately tied together by Poynting's theorem and the Lorentz force law.
Whereas Maxwell's macroscopic equations relate the electric and magnetic fields
to their material sources (i.e., charge, current, polarization and
magnetization), Poynting's theorem governs the flow of electromagnetic energy
and its exchange between fields and material media, while the Lorentz law
regulates the back-and-forth transfer of momentum between the media and the
fields. The close association of momentum with energy thus demands that the
Poynting theorem and the Lorentz law remain consistent with each other, while,
at the same time, ensuring compliance with the conservation laws of energy,
linear momentum, and angular momentum. This paper shows how a consistent
application of the aforementioned laws of electrodynamics to moving permanent
dipoles (both electric and magnetic) brings into play the rest-mass of the
dipoles. The rest mass must vary in response to external electromagnetic fields
if the overall energy of the system is to be conserved. The physical basis for
the inferred variations of the rest-mass appears to be an interference between
the internal fields of the dipoles and the externally applied fields. We use
two different formulations of the classical theory in which energy and momentum
relate differently to the fields, yet we find identical behavior for the
rest-mass in both formulations.

factoring algorithm and several other famous quantum algorithms with
exponential quantum speed-ups for solving Abelian hidden subgroup problems. We
show that all these different forms of quantum computation belong to a common
new restricted model of quantum operations that we call \emph{black-box
normalizer circuits}. To define these, we extend the previous model of
normalizer circuits [arXiv:1201.4867v1,arXiv:1210.3637,arXiv:1409.3208], which
are built of quantum Fourier transforms, group automorphism and quadratic phase
gates associated to an Abelian group $G$. In previous works, the group $G$ is
always given in an explicitly decomposed form. In our model, we remove this
assumption and allow $G$ to be a black-box group. While standard normalizer
circuits were shown to be efficiently classically simulable
[arXiv:1201.4867v1,arXiv:1210.3637,arXiv:1409.3208], we find that normalizer
circuits are powerful enough to factorize and solve classically-hard problems
in the black-box setting. We further set upper limits to their computational
power by showing that decomposing finite Abelian groups is complete for the
associated complexity class. In particular, solving this problem renders
black-box normalizer circuits efficiently classically simulable by exploiting
the generalized stabilizer formalism in
[arXiv:1201.4867v1,arXiv:1210.3637,arXiv:1409.3208]. Lastly, we employ our
connection to draw a few practical implications for quantum algorithm design:

to the Galaxy's spiral arms, using different arm tracers from the literature.
Some arm tracers can have slightly divergent results from several papers, so a
mean is taken - see Appendix for CO, HII, and masers. The Master catalog of
means currently consists of 63 mean tracer entries, spread over many arms
(Carina, Crux-Centaurus, Norma, Perseus origin, near 3-kpc, Scutum,
Sagittarius), stemming from 107 original arm tracer entries.
  Additionally, we updated and revised a previous a previous statistical
analysis of the angular offset and linear separation from the mid-arm, for each
different mean arm tracer. Given enough arm tracers, and summing and averaging
over all spiral arms, one could determine if arm tracers have separate and
parallel lanes in the Milky Way. This statistical analysis allows a cross-cut
of a galactic spiral arm to be made, confirming a recent discovery of a linear
separation between arm tracers. Here, from the mid-arm's CO to the inner edge's
hot dust, the arm half-width is about 340 parsecs; doubling would yield a full
arm width of 680 parsecs. We briefly compare these observations with the

content of its host galaxy. We measured the flux decrement due to absorption at
Ly$\alpha$, $\beta$ and $\gamma$ wavelength regions. The hydrogen and metal
absorption lines formed in the host galaxy were fitted with Voigt profiles to
obtain column densities. Our measurements of the Ly$\alpha$-forest optical
depth are consistent with previous measurements of QSOs, but have a much
smaller uncertainty. The analysis of the red damping wing yields a neutral
fraction $x_{HI}<0.05$ (3$\sigma$). We obtain column density measurements of
several elements. The ionisation corrections due to the GRB is estimated to be
negligible (<0.03 dex), but larger corrections may apply due to the
pre-existing radiation field (up to 0.4 dex based on sub-DLA studies). Our
measurements confirm that the Universe is already predominantly ionised over
the redshift range probed in this work, but was slightly more neutral at z>5.6.
GRBs are useful probes of the ionisation state of the IGM in the early
Universe, but because of internal scatter we need a larger statistical sample
to draw robust conclusions. The high [Si/Fe] in the host can be due to dust
depletion, alpha-element enhancement, or a combination of both. The very high
value of [Al/Fe]=2.40+/-0.78 might connected to the stellar population history.
We estimate the host metallicity to be -1.7<[M/H]<-0.9 (2%-13% of solar).

Thus, the set of LOCC measurements that require an infinite number of rounds is

This means there exist measurements that can only be implemented by LOCC by
using an infinite number of rounds, but can nonetheless be approximated closely

series of linear segments between integer electron points, a condition known as
""piecewise linearity"". Deviation from this condition is indicative of poor
predictive capabilities for electronic structure, in particular of ionization
energies, fundamental gaps, and charge transfer. In this article, we take a new
look at the deviation from linearity (i.e., curvature) in the solid-state limit
by considering two different ways of approaching it: a large finite system of
increasing size and a crystal represented by an increasingly large reference
cell with periodic boundary conditions. We show that the curvature approaches
vanishing values in both limits, even for functionals which yield poor
predictions of electronic structure, and therefore can not be used as a
diagnostic or constructive tool in solids. We find that the approach towards
zero curvature is different in each of the two limits, owing to the presence of
a compensating background charge in the periodic case. Based on these findings,
we present a new criterion for functional construction and evaluation, derived
from the size-dependence of the curvature, along with a practical method for
evaluating this criterion. For large finite systems we further show that the
curvature is dominated by the self-interaction of the highest occupied
eigenstate. These findings are illustrated by computational studies of various
solids, semiconductor nanocrystals, and long alkane chains.

model of self-assembly. The nubot model is an asynchronous nondeterministic
cellular automaton augmented with rigid-body movement rules (push/pull,
deterministically and programmatically applied to specific monomers) and random
agitations (nondeterministically applied to every monomer and direction with
equal probability all of the time). Previous work on the nubot model showed how
to build simple shapes such as lines and squares quickly---in expected time
that is merely logarithmic of their size. These results crucially make use of
the programmable rigid-body movement rule: the ability for a single monomer to
control the movement of a large objects quickly, and only at a time and place
of the programmers' choosing. However, in engineered molecular systems,
molecular motion is largely uncontrolled and fundamentally random. This raises
the question of whether similar results can be achieved in a more restrictive,

agitations, are happening throughout the self-assembly process and are the only
form of rigid-body movement. We show that this is indeed the case: we give a

sublinear expected time construction to build a line. Such results are
impossible in an agitation-free (and movement-free) setting and thus show the

quantification. Recently they have shown excellent performance in the
statistical analysis of integrated circuits. In stochastic spectral methods,
one needs to determine a set of orthonormal polynomials and a proper numerical
quadrature rule. The former are used as the basis functions in a generalized
polynomial chaos expansion. The latter is used to compute the integrals
involved in stochastic spectral methods. Obtaining such information requires
knowing the density function of the random input {\it a-priori}. However,
individual system components are often described by surrogate models rather
than density functions. In order to apply stochastic spectral methods in
hierarchical uncertainty quantification, we first propose to construct
physically consistent closed-form density functions by two monotone
interpolation schemes. Then, by exploiting the special forms of the obtained
density functions, we determine the generalized polynomial-chaos basis
functions and the Gauss quadrature rules that are required by a stochastic

primitive equations of the atmosphere with humidity and saturation, in presence
of topography and subject to physically plausible boundary conditions to the
system of equations. In that respect, a version of a projection method is
introduced to enforce the compatibility condition on the horizontal velocity
field, which comes from the boundary conditions. The resulting scheme allows
for a significant reduction of the errors near the topography when compared to
more standard finite volume schemes. In the numerical simulations, we first
present the associated good convergence results that are satisfied by the
solutions simulated by our scheme when compared to particular analytic
solutions. We then report on numerical experiments using realistic parameters.
Finally, the effects of a random small-scale forcing on the velocity equation
is numerically investigated. The numerical results show that such a forcing is
responsible for recurrent large-scale patterns to emerge in the temperature and
velocity fields.

generalized polynomial chaos expansion to perform uncertainty quantification of
nonlinear transistor circuits with both Gaussian and non-Gaussian random
parameters. We modify the nonintrusive stochastic collocation (SC) method and
develop an intrusive variant called stochastic testing (ST) method to
accelerate the numerical simulation. Compared with the stochastic Galerkin (SG)
method, the resulting coupled deterministic equations from our proposed ST
method can be solved in a decoupled manner at each time point. At the same
time, ST uses fewer samples and allows more flexible time step size controls
than directly using a nonintrusive SC solver. These two properties make ST more
efficient than SG and than existing SC methods, and more suitable for
time-domain circuit simulation. Simulation results of several digital, analog
and RF circuits are reported. Since our algorithm is based on generic
mathematical models, the proposed ST algorithm can be applied to many other
engineering problems.

stands for a collective case and $\alpha=s$ for a self case. By employing the
same simplification on the nonlinear memory function as that proposed by the
mode-coupling theory (MCT), the simplified asymptotic recursion formula is then
derived and is numerically analyzed for different temperatures under the
initial conditions obtained from the simulation. In a liquid state the
numerical results are shown to recover the simulation results well. Although
they can describe the simulation results well in the $\beta$-relaxation stage
even for lower temperatures, they do not agree with those in the so-called
$\alpha$-relaxation stage because of the simplified model. The coupling
parameter $\lambda^{(\alpha)}$ dependence of the Debye-Waller factor
$f_{\alpha}$ is also discussed. The critical point is found as
$\lambda_c^{(c)}=2e(\simeq 5.43656)$ and $f_c=e^{-1/2}(\simeq 0.60653)$, while
MCT gives $\lambda_c^{(c)}=4.0$ and $f_c=1/2$. Then, the critical temperature
$T_c$ is shown to be definitely lower than that predicted by MCT. Thus, it is
emphasized that the present theory can improve the high $T_c$ problem appeared
in MCT. The time evolution of the memory function and that of the diffusion

liquids, depending on the anisotropy of the interactions. This model can be
rewritten as a free Majorana fermion system coupled with $Z_2$ variables. The
density of states of Majorana fermions shows an excitation gap in the gapped
region, while it is semimetallic in the gapless region reflecting the Dirac
node. Performing the Monte Carlo simulation, we calculate the temperature
dependence of the Majorana spectra. We find that the semimetallic dip is filled
up as temperature increases in the gapless region, but surprisingly, the
spectrum develops an excitation gap in the region near the gapless-gapped
boundary. Such changes of the low-energy spectrum appear sharply at the
transition temperature from the spin liquid to the paramagnetic state. The
results indicate that thermal fluctuations of the $Z_2$ fields significantly
influence the low-energy state of Majorana fermions, especially in the spin

conclude that it is better to deal with the non-linear effects in the

SDO/HMI, SMFT has larger stray light and acquires less magnetic field strength.
For vector magnetic fields in two sunspot regions, the magnetic field strength,
inclination and azimuth angles between SMFT and HMI are roughly in agrement,

  different baryon fractions, comments welcome",,"10.1093/mnras/stu2760",,"astro-ph.GA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Using hydrodynamic simulations, we study the mass loss due to
supernova-driven outflows from Milky Way type disk galaxies, paying particular
attention to the effect of the extended hot halo gas. We find that the total
mass loss at inner radii scales roughly linearly with total mass of stars
formed, and that the mass loading factor at the virial radius can be several
times its value at inner radii because of the swept up hot halo gas. The
temperature distribution of the outflowing material in the inner region ($\sim
$10 kpc) is bimodal in nature, peaking at $10^5$ K and $10^{6.5}$ K,
responsible for optical and X-ray emission, respectively. The contribution of
cold/warm gas with temperature $\le 10^{5.5}$ K to the outflow rate within 10
kpc is $\approx 0.3\hbox{--}0.5$. The warm mass loading factor, $\eta_{3e5}$
($T\le 3 \times 10^5$ K) is related to the mass loading factor at the virial
radius ($\eta_{v}$) as $\eta_{v} \approx 25\, \eta_{3e5}\,
\left(\mbox{SFR}/{\rm M}_\odot{\rm yr}^{-1} \right)^{-0.15}$ for a baryon
fraction of 0.1 and a starburst period of 50 Myr. We also discuss the effect of
multiple bursts that are separated by both short and long periods. The outflow
speed at the virial radius is close to the sound speed in the hot halo,
$\lesssim 200$ km s$^{-1}$. We identify two `sequences' of outflowing cold gas
at small scales: a fast ($\approx 500$ km~s$^{-1}$) sequence, driven by the
unshocked free-wind; and a slow sequence ($\approx \pm 100$ km s$^{-1}$) at the
conical interface of the superwind and the hot halo.

high-transition-temperature superconductors (HTS), researchers have explored
many methods to fabricate superconducting tunnel junctions from these materials
for both superconducting electronics operating at the practical temperature of
liquid nitrogen (77 K) and for fundamental measurements essential for testing
and guiding theories of these remarkable superconductors. The difficulty is
that the traditional estimate of the superconducting coherence length is very
short and anisotropic in these materials, typically ~2 nm in the a-b plane and
~0.2 nm along the c-axis. The coherence volume encloses very few
superconducting pairs, so even the presence of small scale inhomogeneities can
locally disrupt superconductivity unlike in conventional superconductors.
Therefore the electrical properties of Josephson junctions are sensitive to
chemical variations and structural defects on atomic length scales, thus to
make multiple uniform HTS junctions, control at the atomic level is required.
In this letter, we demonstrate very high-quality all-HTS Josephson
superconducting tunnel junctions (both Josephson and quasiparticle tunneling)
created by using a 500 pm diameter focused beam of helium ions to direct-write
tunnel barriers into YBa2Cu3O7(YBCO) thin films. With this method we
demonstrate the ability to control the barrier properties continuously from
conducting to insulating by varying the irradiation dose. This technique
provides a reliable and reproducible pathway for the scaling up of quantum
mechanical circuits operating at practical temperatures (~77 K) as well as an
avenue to conduct superconducting tunneling studies in HTS for basic science.

up after finite time for data in H2, and there are classical solution branches

viscosity limits of viscosity extensions of time-reversed Euler-type equations.

stars, and therefore offer a unique opportunity to observe any changes in the
formation processes that may occur across this boundary. This paper presents
medium resolution VLT/X-Shooter spectra of six Herbig Ae/Be stars, drawn from a
sample of 91 targets, and high resolution VLT/CRIRES spectra of five Herbig
Ae/Be stars, chosen based on the presence of CO first overtone bandhead
emission in their spectra. The X-Shooter survey reveals a low detection rate of
CO first overtone emission (7 per cent), consisting of objects mainly of
spectral type B. A positive correlation is found between the strength of the CO
v=2-0 and Br {\gamma} emission lines, despite their intrinsic linewidths
suggesting a separate kinematic origin. The high resolution CRIRES spectra are
modelled, and are well fitted under the assumption that the emission originates
from small scale Keplerian discs, interior to the dust sublimation radius, but
outside the co-rotation radius of the central stars. In addition, our findings
are in very good agreement for the one object where spatially resolved
near-infrared interferometric studies have also been performed. These results
suggest that the Herbig Ae/Be stars in question are in the process of gaining
mass via disc accretion, and that modelling of high spectral resolution spectra
is able to provide a reliable probe into the process of stellar accretion in
young stars of intermediate to high masses.

in Keplerian rotation. The 0.9-mm continuum shows two opposing U-shaped

circumbinary disk and the circumstellar disk of the primary protostar. The
molecular lines trace non-axisymmetric deviations from Keplerian rotation in
the circumbinary disk at higher velocities relative to the systemic velocity,
where our previous SMA observations could not detect the lines. In addition, we
detect inward motion along the minor axis of the circumbinary disk. To explain
the newly-observed features, we performed a numerical simulation of gas orbits
in a Roche potential tailored to the inferred properties of L1551 NE. The
observed U-shaped dust features coincide with locations where gravitational
torques from the central binary system are predicted to impart angular momentum
to the circumbinary disk, producing shocks and hence density enhancements seen
as a pair of spiral arms. The observed inward gas motion coincides with
locations where angular momentum is predicted to be lowered by the
gravitational torques. The good agreement between our observation and model
indicates that gravitational torques from the binary stars constitute the
primary driver for exchanging angular momentum so as to permit infall through
the circumbinary disk of L1551 NE.

organismal complexity and adaptive properties, determining at once genomic
plasticity and those constraints that may limit the ability of genomes to
attain evolutionary innovations. An exhaustive experimental characterization of
the relationship between genotypes and phenotypes is at present out of reach.
Therefore, several models mimicking that map have been proposed and
investigated, leading to the identification of a number of general features:
genotypes differ in their robustness to mutations, phenotypes are represented
by a broadly varying number of genotypes, and simple point mutations seem to
suffice to navigate the space of genotypes while maintaining a phenotype.
However, most current models address only one level of the map (sequences and
folded structures in RNA or proteins; networks of genes and their dynamical
attractors; sets of chemical reactions and their ability to undergo molecular
catalysis), such that many relevant questions cannot be addressed. Here we
introduce toyLIFE, a multi-level model for the genotype-phenotype map based on
simple genomes and interaction rules from which a complex behavior at upper
levels emerges, remarkably plastic gene regulatory networks and metabolism.
toyLIFE is a tool that permits the investigation of how different levels are
coupled, in particular how and where do mutations affect phenotype or how the
presence of certain metabolites determines the dynamics of toyLIFE gene
regulatory networks. The possibilities of this model are not exhausted by the
results presented in this contribution. It can be easily generalized to
incorporate evolution through mutations that change genome length or through
recombination, to consider gene duplication or deletion, and therefore to
explore further properties of extended genotype-phenotype maps.

fit to those timings indicated that the orbital period of NY Vir has varied due
to a combination of two sinusoids with periods of $P_3$=8.2 yr and $P_4$=27.0
yr and semi-amplitudes of $K_3$=6.9 s and $K_4$=27.3 s, respectively. The
periodic variations most likely arise from a pair of light-time effects due to
the presence of third and fourth bodies that are gravitationally bound to the
eclipsing pair. We have derived the orbital parameters and the minimum masses,
$M_3 \sin i_3$ = 2.8 M$\rm_{Jup}$ and $M_4 \sin i_4$ = 4.5 M$\rm_{Jup}$, of
both objects. A dynamical analysis suggests that the outer companion is less
likely to orbit the binary on a circular orbit. Instead we show that future
timing data might push its eccentricity to moderate values for which the system
exhibits long-term stability. The results demonstrate that NY Vir is probably a
star-planet system, which consists of a very close binary star and two giant
planets. The period ratio $P_{3}/P_{4}$ suggests that a long-term gravitational
interaction between them would result in capture into a nearly 3:10 mean motion
resonance. When the presence of the circumbinary planets is verified and

suitable specification of the conformal structure of the foliating two-surfaces
a gauge fixing is introduced. It is shown that, in terms of the chosen

very high vacuum expectation value (VEV) for the Higgs field, $< \phi > \approx
10^{17-18}$ GeV. Furthermore, if such a vacuum were realized then cancellation
of vacuum energy automatically implies that this nontrivial vacuum is
degenerate with the trivial unbroken vacuum. Such a theory would therefore be
critical with the Higgs self-coupling and its beta function nearly vanishing at
the symmetry breaking minimum, $\lambda (\mu=< \phi >)\approx \beta_{\lambda}
(\mu=< \phi >)\approx 0$. A phenomenologically viable model that predicts this
criticality property arises if we consider two copies of the standard model
Lagrangian, with exact $Z_2$ symmetry swapping each ordinary particle with a
partner. The spontaneously broken vacuum can then arise where one sector gains
the high scale VEV, while the other gains the electroweak scale VEV. The low
scale VEV is perturbed away from zero due to a Higgs portal coupling, or via
the usual small Higgs mass terms $\mu_h^2$, which softly break the scale

Identification (RFID) systems as the de facto standard in tag identification.
However, very limited work has been done on the stability of FSA despite its
fundamental importance both on the theoretical characterisation of FSA
performance and its effective operation in practical systems. In order to
bridge this gap, we devote this paper to investigating the stability properties
of FSA by focusing on two physical layer models of practical importance, the
models with single packet reception and multipacket reception capabilities.
Technically, we model the FSA system backlog as a Markov chain with its states
being backlog size at the beginning of each frame. The objective is to analyze
the ergodicity of the Markov chain and demonstrate its properties in different
regions, particularly the instability region. By employing drift analysis, we
obtain the closed-form conditions for the stability of FSA and show that the
stability region is maximised when the frame length equals the backlog size in
the single packet reception model and when the ratio of the backlog size to
frame length equals in order of magnitude the maximum multipacket reception
capacity in the multipacket reception model. Furthermore, to characterise
system behavior in the instability region, we mathematically demonstrate the
existence of transience of the backlog Markov chain.

calculations of the flux of $\nu_e$ from $K_S$. At energies above their

combination of heuristics providing candidate solutions and a candidate
validation technique. Essentially, the heuristic reduces a second-order problem
to a first-order/propositional one, while the validation is often just a call
to a SAT/SMT solver. This results in a monolithic design of such analyses that
conflates the formulation of the problem with the solving process.
Consequently, any change to the latter causes changes to the whole analysis.
This design is dictated by the state of the art in solver technology. While
SAT/SMT solvers have experienced tremendous progress, there are barely any
second-order solvers. This paper takes a step towards addressing this situation
by proposing a decidable fragment of second-order logic that is still
expressive enough to capture numerous program analysis problems (e.g. safety
proving, bug finding, termination and non-termination proving,
superoptimisation). We refer to the satisfiability problem for this fragment as

a fast and reliable manner. The functional architecture is thought to play a
central role in this task, by encoding efficiently complex stimuli and
facilitating higher level processing. In the early visual cortex of higher
mammals, information is processed within functional maps whose layout is
thought to underlie visual perception. The possible principles underlying the
topology of the different maps, as well as the role of a specific functional
architecture on information processing, is however poorly understood. We
demonstrate mathematically here that two natural principles, local exhaustivity
of representation and parsimony, would constrain the orientation and spatial
frequency maps to display co-located singularities around which the orientation
is organized as a pinwheel and spatial frequency as a dipole. This observation
is perfectly in line with new optical imaging data on the cat visual cortex we
analyze in a companion paper. Here we further focus on the theoretical
implications of this structure. Using a computational model, we show that this
architecture allows a trade-off in the local perception of orientation and
spatial frequency, but this would occur for sharper selectivity than the tuning
width reported in the literature. We therefore re-examined physiological data
and show that indeed the spatial frequency selectivity substantially sharpens
near maps singularities, bringing to the prediction that the system tends to
optimize balanced detection between different attributes. These results shed
new light on the principles at play in the emergence of functional architecture
of cortical maps, as well as their potential role in processing information.

$^{70}$Zn, jj44b interaction in $^{2}p_{3/2}$, $^{1}f_{5/2}$, $^{2}p_{1/2}$ and
$^{1}g_{9/2}$ space with $^{56}$Ni as the core is employed. However, for
$^{80}$Se and $^{82}$Se nuclei, a modified Kuo interaction with the above core
and model space are employed. Most of our calculations in this region were
performed with this effective interaction. However, jj44b interaction has been
found to be better for $^{70}$Zn. The above model space was used in many recent
shell model and interacting boson model calculations for nuclei in this region.
After ensuring that DSM gives good description of the spectroscopic properties
of low-lying levels in these three nuclei considered, the NTME are calculated.
The deduced half-lives with these NTME, assuming neutrino mass is 1 eV, are
$1.1 \times 10^{26}$ yr, $2.3 \times 10^{27}$ yr and $2.2 \times 10^{24}$ yr

fiber-optic sensor for detection of environmental toxin microcystin-LR (MC-LR).
Thiolated MC-LR-targeting aptamer covalently immobilized on dual-resonance
long-period fiber gratings (DR-LPFG) is used as MC-LR recognition element and
the spectral response of the DR-LPFG is monitored for various concentrations of
MC-LR. Sensitivity of the DR-LPFG is optimized by coating an appropriate
thickness of gold layer to the fiber surface. Gold coating serves two purposes,
first it locally supports a surface-Plasmon mode associated with the modified
cladding modes and second it helps covalently immobilize the MC-LR targeting
aptamer to the sensor surface. Monitoring both the resonance wavelengths of our
ultra sensitive DR-LPFGs (3891.5 nm/RIU) we study the aptamer and MC-LR binding
to the sensor surface. Real-time, efficient MC-LR molecular binding to the
sensor surface is also confirmed using atomic force microscopy. The detection
limit of our sensor, limited by the molecule size of MC-LR, its fractional
surface coverage of the sensor, and sensor length, is 5 ng/mL, which can be
further improved by increasing the fractional MC-LR coverage on the sensor
surface by (i) reducing the LPFG length (ii) increasing grating strength, (iii)
increasing the LPFG sensitivity by coupling to even higher order cladding modes
by reducing the grating period.

the realm of parameterized complexity: Given an input graph (digraph) on $n$
vertices and a positive integer parameter $k$, find if there exist $k$ edges
(arcs) whose deletion results in a graph that satisfies some specified parity
constraints. In particular, when the objective is to obtain a connected graph
in which all the vertices have even degrees---where the resulting graph is
\emph{Eulerian}---the problem is called Undirected Eulerian Edge Deletion. The
corresponding problem in digraphs where the resulting graph should be strongly
connected and every vertex should have the same in-degree as its out-degree is
called Directed Eulerian Edge Deletion. Cygan et al. [\emph{Algorithmica,
2014}] showed that these problems are fixed parameter tractable (FPT), and gave
algorithms with the running time $2^{O(k \log k)}n^{O(1)}$. They also asked, as
an open problem, whether there exist FPT algorithms which solve these problems
in time $2^{O(k)}n^{O(1)}$. In this paper we answer their question in the
affirmative: using the technique of computing \emph{representative families of
co-graphic matroids} we design algorithms which solve these problems in time
$2^{O(k)}n^{O(1)}$. The crucial insight we bring to these problems is to view
the solution as an independent set of a co-graphic matroid. We believe that
this view-point/approach will be useful in other problems where one of the
constraints that need to be satisfied is that of connectivity.

vertex cover number is at most $r-1$ times the matching number. This conjecture
is only known to be true for $r\leq 3$. For intersecting hypergraphs, Ryser's
Conjecture reduces to saying that the edges of every $r$-partite intersecting
hypergraph can be covered by $r-1$ vertices. This special case of the
conjecture has only been proven for $r \leq 5$.
  It is interesting to study hypergraphs which are extremal in Ryser's
Conjecture i.e, those hypergraphs for which the vertex cover number is exactly
$r-1$ times the matching number. There are very few known constructions of such
graphs. For large $r$ the only known constructions come from projective planes
and exist only when $r-1$ is a prime power. Mansour, Song and Yuster studied
how few edges a hypergraph which is extremal for Ryser's Conjecture can have.
They defined $f(r)$ as the minimum integer so that there exist an $r$-partite
intersecting hypergraph $\mathcal{H}$ with $\tau({\mathcal{H}}) = r -1$ and
with $f(r)$ edges. They showed that $f(3) = 3, f(4) = 6$, $f(5) = 9$, and
$12\leq f(6)\leq 15$.
  In this paper we focus on the cases when $r=6$ and 7. We show that $f(6)=13$
improving previous bounds. We also show that $f(7)\leq 22$, giving the first
known extremal hypergraphs for the $r=7$ case of Ryser's Conjecture. These
results have been obtained independently by Aharoni, Barat, and Wanless.

accelerated outward from the polar cap of a normal or millisecond pulsar whose
rotational spin is antiparallel with its magnetic moment. The Langmuir modes of
this relativistic plasma have several properties of significance for the origin
of coherent radio emission. The characteristics of the mode are determined by
the sequence of singularities in the dielectric tensor at real angular
frequencies, which in turn is fixed by the electron-positron momentum
distribution. We find that under a certain condition on its momentum
distribution, an electron-positron flux two orders of magnitude smaller than
the Goldreich-Julian flux stabilizes the plasma and extinguishes the mode. But
more generally, both the growth rate and wavenumber of the multi-component
Langmuir mode can be as much as an order of magnitude larger than those of the
two-component ion-proton mode. It appears to be a further effective source for
the plasma turbulence whose decay is probably responsible for the observed
emission.

power-law, are ubiquitous in the study of complex systems. One basic network
property that relates to the structure of the links found is the degree
assortativity, which is a measure of the correlation between the degrees of the
nodes at the end of the links. Degree correlations are known to affect both the
structure of a network and the dynamics of the processes supported thereon,
including the resilience to damage, the spread of information and epidemics,
and the efficiency of defence mechanisms. Nonetheless, while many studies focus
on undirected scale-free networks, the interactions in real-world systems often
have a directionality. Here, we investigate the dependence of the degree
correlations on the power-law exponents in directed scale-free networks. To
perform our study, we consider the problem of building directed networks with a
prescribed degree distribution, providing a method for proper generation of
power-law-distributed directed degree sequences. Applying this new method, we
perform extensive numerical simulations, generating ensembles of directed
scale-free networks with exponents between~2 and~3, and measuring ensemble
averages of the Pearson correlation coefficients. Our results show that
scale-free networks are on average uncorrelated across directed links for three
of the four possible degree-degree correlations, namely in-degree to in-degree,
in-degree to out-degree, and out-degree to out-degree. However, they exhibit
anticorrelation between the number of outgoing connections and the number of
incoming ones. The findings are consistent with an entropic origin for the
observed disassortativity in biological and technological networks.

  Progress and Challenges",,,,"cs.RO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Whole-arm tactile sensing enables a robot to sense contact and infer contact
properties across its entire arm. Within this paper, we demonstrate that using
data-driven methods, a humanoid robot can infer mechanical properties of
objects from contact with its forearm during a simple reaching motion. A key
issue is the extent to which the performance of data-driven methods can
generalize to robot actions that differ from those used during training. To
investigate this, we developed an idealized physics-based lumped element model
of a robot with a compliant joint making contact with an object. Using this
physics-based model, we performed experiments with varied robot, object and
environment parameters. We also collected data from a tactile-sensing forearm
on a real robot as it made contact with various objects during a simple
reaching motion with varied arm velocities and joint stiffnesses. The robot
used one nearest neighbor classifiers (1-NN), hidden Markov models (HMMs), and
long short-term memory (LSTM) networks to infer two object properties (hard vs.
soft and moved vs. unmoved) based on features of time-varying tactile sensor
data (maximum force, contact area, and contact motion). We found that, in
contrast to 1-NN, the performance of LSTMs (with sufficient data availability)
and multivariate HMMs successfully generalized to new robot motions with
distinct velocities and joint stiffnesses. Compared to single features, using
multiple features gave the best results for both experiments with physics-based
models and a real-robot.

excited-state losses in the prototypical conjugated polymer

revealed, based on singlet-triplet exciton annihilation, which accounts for the
dramatic loss in fluorescence quantum yield of a single P3HT chain between its
solution (unfolded) and bulk-like (folded) state. Triplet excitons
fundamentally limit the fluorescence of organic photovoltaic materials, which
impacts on the conversion of singlet excitons to separated charge carriers,
decreasing the efficiency of energy harvesting at high excitation densities.
Interexcitonic interactions are so effective that a single P3HT chain of >100
kDa weight behaves like a two-level system, exhibiting perfect
photon-antibunching.

Gamma-ray burst (GRBs) afterglows probe sightlines to star-forming
regions in distant star-forming galaxies. Here we present a study of the
peculiar afterglow spectrum of the z = 0.889 Swift GRB 140506A. Aims. Our aim
is to understand the origin of the very unusual properties of the absorption
along the line-of-sight. Methods. We analyse spectroscopic observations
obtained with the X-shooter spectrograph mounted on the ESO/VLT at two epochs
8.8 h and 33 h after the burst as well as imaging from the GROND instrument. We
also present imaging and spectroscopy of the host galaxy obtained with the
Magellan telescope. Results. The underlying afterglow appears to be a typical
afterglow of a long-duration GRB. However, the material along the line-of-
sight has imprinted very unusual features on the spectrum. Firstly, there is a
very broad and strong flux drop below 8000 AA (4000 AA in the rest frame),
which seems to be variable between the two spectroscopic epochs. We can
reproduce the flux-drops both as a giant 2175 AA extinction bump and as an
effect of multiple scattering on dust grains in a dense environment. Secondly,
we detect absorption lines from excited H i and He i. We also detect molecular
absorption from CH+ . Conclusions. We interpret the unusual properties of these
spectra as reflecting the presence of three distinct regions along the
line-of-sight: the excited He i absorption originates from an H ii-region,
whereas the Balmer absorption must originate from an associated
photodissociation region. The strong metal line and molecular absorption and
the dust extinction must originate from a third, cooler region along the
line-of-sight. The presence of (at least) three separate regions is reflected
in the fact that the different absorption components have different velocities
relative to the systemic redshift of the host galaxy.

that mediates the intracellular response to hypoxia in human cells. There is
increasing evidence that cell signaling pathways encode temporal information,
and thus cell fate may be determined by the dynamics of protein levels. We have
developed a mathematical model to describe the transient dynamics of the
HIF-1{\alpha} protein measured in single cells subjected to hypoxic shock. The
essential characteristics of these data are modeled with a system of
differential equations describing the feedback inhibition between HIF-1{\alpha}
and Prolyl Hydroxylases (PHD) oxygen sensors. Heterogeneity in the single-cell
data is accounted for through parameter variation in the model. We previously
identified the PHD2 isoform as the main PHD responsible for controlling the
HIF-1{\alpha} transient response, and make here testable predictions regarding
HIF-1{\alpha} dynamics subject to repetitive hypoxic pulses. The model is
further developed to describe the dynamics of HIF-1{\alpha} in cells cultured
as 3D spheroids, with oxygen dynamics parameterized using experimental
measurements of oxygen within spheroids. We show that the dynamics of
HIF-1{\alpha} and transcriptional targets of HIF-1{\alpha} display a
non-monotone response to the oxygen dynamics. Specifically we demonstrate that
the dynamic transient behavior of HIF-1{\alpha} results in differential
dynamics in transcriptional targets.

group into four major trajectories. We conducted a meta-analysis of 18 lineages
containing species that use C$_3$, C$_4$, or intermediate C$_3$-C$_4$ forms of

developed and experimentally verified a novel Bayesian approach based on a

alternative evolutionary histories underlying the appearance of C$_4$

alterations unrelated to photosynthesis. We conclude that the order of C$_4$

flexibility will have facilitated the convergent evolution of this complex

reflection amplitude in the vicinity of the degeneracy points of the two DQDs.
This phenomenon is explained by the Tavis-Cummings (T-C) mode. We further
characterize this nonlocal coupling by measuring the correlation between the DC

on the average photon number in the resonator. Our results explore T-C physics

effect of dynamical friction on a test object only slightly more massive than
the field stars, orbiting a spherically symmetric background of particles with
a mass spectrum. The main goal is to verify whether the dynamical friction time
(t_DF) develops a non-monotonic radial-dependence that could explain the
bimodality of the Blue Straggler radial distributions observed in globular
clusters. In these systems, in fact, relaxation effects lead to a mass and
velocity radial segregation of the different mass components, so that
mass-spectrum effects on t_DF are expected to be dependent on radius. We find
that, in spite of the presence of different masses, t_DF is always a monotonic
function of radius, at all evolutionary times and independently of the initial
concentration of the simulated cluster. This because the radial dependence of
t_DF is largely dominated by the total mass density profile of the background
stars (which is monotonically decreasing with radius). Hence, a progressive
temporal erosion of the BSS population at larger and larger distances from the
cluster center remains the simplest and the most likely explanation of the
shape of the observed BSS radial distributions, as suggested in previous works.
We also confirm the theoretical expectation that approximating a multi-mass
globular cluster as made of (averaged) equal-mass stars can lead to significant
overestimates of t_DF within the half-mass radius.

choose the artificial electron mass parameter appearing in the Car-Parrinello

paper, we propose an algorithm, motivated by the Landau-Zener probability, to
systematically choose an artificial mass dynamically, which makes the

spinor field in the evolution of the Universe. It is found that due to the

non-diagonal, whereas the Einstein tensor is diagonal. This non-triviality of
non-diagonal components of the energy-momentum tensor imposes some severe
restrictions either on the spinor field or on the metric functions or on both
of them. In case if the restrictions are imposed on the components of spinor
field only, we come to a situation when spinor field becomes massless and
invariants constructed from bilinear spinor forms also become trivial. Imposing
restriction wholly on metric functions we obtain FRW model, while if the
restrictions are imposed both on metric functions and spinor field components,
we come to LRS BI model. In both cases the system is solved completely. It was
found that if the relation between the pressure and energy density obeys a
barotropic equation of state, only a non-trivial spinor mass can give rise to a

image-dependent. Although many methods have been proposed for image
auto-annotation, the question of how to determine the number of tags to be
selected per image remains open. The main challenge is that for a large tag
vocabulary, there is often a lack of ground truth data for acquiring optimal
cutoff thresholds per tag. In contrast to previous works that pre-specify the
number of tags to be selected, we propose in this paper adaptive tag selection.
The key insight is to divide the vocabulary into two disjoint subsets, namely a
seen set consisting of tags having ground truth available for optimizing their
thresholds and a novel set consisting of tags without any ground truth. Such a
division allows us to estimate how many tags shall be selected from the novel
set according to the tags that have been selected from the seen set. The
effectiveness of the proposed method is justified by our participation in the
ImageCLEF 2014 image annotation task. On a set of 2,065 test images with ground
truth available for 207 tags, the benchmark evaluation shows that compared to
the popular top-$k$ strategy which obtains an F-score of 0.122, adaptive tag
selection achieves a higher F-score of 0.223. Moreover, by treating the
underlying image annotation system as a black box, the new method can be used
as an easy plug-in to boost the performance of existing systems.

most validated and widely used clinical decision rules are the Wells and Geneva
Revised scores. We aimed to develop a new clinical prediction rule (CPR) for PE
based on topological data analysis and artificial neural network. Filter or
wrapper methods for features reduction cannot be applied to our dataset: the
application of these algorithms can only be performed on datasets without
missing data. Instead, we applied Topological data analysis (TDA) to overcome
the hurdle of processing datasets with null values missing data. A topological
network was developed using the Iris software (Ayasdi, Inc., Palo Alto). The PE
patient topology identified two ares in the pathological group and hence two
distinct clusters of PE patient populations. Additionally, the topological
netowrk detected several sub-groups among healthy patients that likely are
affected with non-PE diseases. TDA was further utilized to identify key
features which are best associated as diagnostic factors for PE and used this
information to define the input space for a back-propagation artificial neural
network (BP-ANN). It is shown that the area under curve (AUC) of BP-ANN is
greater than the AUCs of the scores (Wells and revised Geneva) used among

privacy. To solve this problem, we propose CryptGraph, which runs graph
analytics on encrypted graph to preserve the privacy of both users' graph data

uploading them to the cloud. The cloud runs graph analysis on the encrypted
graphs and obtains results which are also in encrypted form that the cloud
cannot decipher. During the process of computing, the encrypted graphs are
never decrypted on the cloud side. The encrypted results are sent back to users
and users perform the decryption to obtain the plaintext results. In this
process, users' graphs and the analytics results are both encrypted and the
cloud knows neither of them. Thereby, users' privacy can be strongly protected.
Meanwhile, with the help of homomorphic encryption, the results analyzed from
the encrypted graphs are guaranteed to be correct. In this paper, we present
how to encrypt a graph using homomorphic encryption and how to query the
structure of an encrypted graph by computing polynomials. To solve the problem
that certain operations are not executable on encrypted graphs, we propose hard
computation outsourcing to seek help from users. Using two graph algorithms as

candidates for developing spintronics devices, because of the coexistence of
spin-split bulk and surface states, along with the ambipolar character of the
surface charge carriers. The need of studying the spin texture of strongly
spin-orbit coupled materials has recently promoted circular dichroic Angular
Resolved Photoelectron Spectroscopy (cd-ARPES) as an indirect tool to measure
the spin and the angular degrees of freedom. Here we report a detailed photon
energy dependent study of the cd-ARPES spectra in BiTeX (X = I, Br and Cl). Our
work reveals a large variation of the magnitude and sign of the dichroism.
Interestingly, we find that the dichroic signal modulates differently for the
three compounds and for the different spin-split states. These findings show a
momentum and photon energy dependence for the cd-ARPES signals in the bulk
Rashba semiconductor BiTeX (X = I, Br, Cl). Finally, the outcome of our
experiment indicates the important relation between the modulation of the
dichroism and the phase differences between the wave-functions involved in the
photoemission process. This phase difference can be due to initial or final
state effects. In the former case the phase difference results in possible
interference effects among the photo-electrons emitted from different atomic
layers and characterized by entangled spin-orbital polarized bands. In the
latter case the phase difference results from the relative phases of the
expansion of the final state in different outgoing partial waves.

one vector and one pseudoscalar mesons (VP) are analyzed within the framework

symmetry breaking factors in the decay amplitudes and found to be a good
approximate symmetry. In the PP sector, the color-suppressed tree amplitude is
found to be larger than previously known and has a strong phase of ~ -70^o
relative to the color-favored tree amplitude. We have extracted for the first
time the W-exchange and penguin-annihilation amplitudes. The former has a size
of about the QCD-penguin amplitude and a phase opposite to that of the
color-favored tree amplitude, while the latter is suppressed in magnitude but
gives the dominant contribution to the $B_s^0 \to \pi^+ \pi^-$ and $\pi^0
\pi^0$ decays. In the VP sector, one striking feature is that the
color-suppressed tree amplitude with the spectator quark ending up in the
vector meson has a large size and a strong phase of ~ -90^o relative to the
color-favored tree amplitudes. The associated electroweak penguin amplitude
also has a similar strong phase and a magnitude comparable to the corresponding
QCD penguin amplitude. This leads to a large branching fraction of order
10^{-6} for $B_s^0 \to \phi \pi^0$. In contrast, the color-suppressed tree, QCD
penguin, and electroweak penguin amplitudes with the spectator quark ending up
in the pseudoscalar meson have magnitudes more consistent with naive
expectations. Besides, current data are not sufficiently precise for us to fix
the W-exchange amplitudes. For both the PP and VP sectors, predictions of all
the decay modes are made based upon our preferred fit results and compared with
data and those made by perturbative approaches. We have identified a few
observables to be determined experimentally in order to discriminate among
theory calculations.

between the resonators induces an additional source of non-hermiticity, and a
complex band structure arises. We show that in this situation the group
velocity of wave packets differs from the velocity associated with the
probability density flux, with the difference arising from a non-hermitian
correction to the Hellmann-Feynman theorem. Exploring these features
numerically in a realistic scenario, we find that the complex band structure
comprises almost-real branches and complex branches, which are joined by
exceptional points, i.e., nonhermitian degeneracies at which not only the
frequencies and decay rates coalesce but also the eigenmodes themselves. The
non-hermitian corrections to the group velocity are largest in the regions
around the exceptional points.

attention in the domain of sociology and behavioral sciences. Social networks
also exhibit dynamic nature as these networks change continuously with the
passage of time. Social networks might also present a hierarchical structure
led by individuals that play important roles in a society such as Managers and
Decision Makers. Detection and Visualization of these networks changing over
time is a challenging problem where communities change as a function of events
taking place in the society and the role people play in it.
  In this paper we address these issues by presenting a system to analyze
dynamic social networks. The proposed system is based on dynamic graph
discretization and graph clustering. The system allows detection of major
structural changes taking place in social communities over time and reveals
hierarchies by identifying influential people in a social networks. We use two
different data sets for the empirical evaluation and observe that our system
helps to discover interesting facts about the social and hierarchical
structures present in these social networks.

relative to classical theories, namely, that there is a fundamental restriction
on the sorts of statistical distributions over physical states that can be
prepared. This is termed an ""epistemic restriction"" because it implies a
fundamental limit on the amount of knowledge that any observer can have about
the physical state of a classical system. This article provides an overview of
epistricted theories, that is, theories that start from a classical statistical
theory and apply an epistemic restriction. We consider both continuous and
discrete degrees of freedom, and show that a particular epistemic restriction
called classical complementarity provides the beginning of a unification of all
known epistricted theories. This restriction appeals to the symplectic
structure of the underlying classical theory and consequently can be applied to
an arbitrary classical degree of freedom. As such, it can be considered as a
kind of quasi-quantization scheme; ""quasi"" because it generally only yields a
theory describing a subset of the preparations, transformations and
measurements allowed in the full quantum theory for that degree of freedom, and
because in some cases, such as for binary variables, it yields a theory that is
a distortion of such a subset. Finally, we propose to classify quantum
phenomena as weakly or strongly nonclassical by whether or not they can arise
in an epistricted theory.

set consists of controllers for dynamical systems. Those programs typically
execute an infinite loop in which simple com putations update internal states
and produce commands to update the system state. Those systems are yet hardly
analyzable by available static analysis method, since, even if performing
mainly linear computations, the computation of a safe set of reachable states
often requires quadratic invariants. In this paper we consider the general
setting of a piecewise affine program; that is a program performing different
affine updates on the system depending on some conditions. This typically
encompasses linear controllers with saturations or controllers with different
behaviors and performances activated on some safety conditions. Our analysis is
inspired by works performed a decade ago by Johansson et al, and Morari et al,
in the control community. We adapted their method focused on the analysis of
stability in continuous-time or discrete-time settings to fit the static
analysis paradigm and the computation of invariants, that is over-approximation
of reachable sets using piecewise quadratic Lyapunov functions.

to define a concept of signal matched synthesis filter bank, hence combining
definitions of part I and part II we obtain a filter bank matched to a given
signal. We also develop a fast time and order recursive, least squares
algorithm for obtaining the same. The synthesis filters, obtained here,
reconstruct the given signal only and not every signal from the finite energy
signal space (i.e. belonging to L^2(R)), as is usually done. The recursions, so
obtained, result in a lattice-like structure. Since the filter parameters are
not directly available, we also present an order recursive algorithm for the
computation of signal matched synthesis filter bank coefficients from the
lattice parameters. The second objective is to explore the possibility of using
synthesis side for modeling of a given stochastic process. Simulation results
have also been presented to validate the theory.

increases with the input pump pulse intensity, as long as the Langmuir wave

However, at high pump intensity, the Langmuir wave breaks, at which point the
amplification efficiency may no longer increase with the pump intensity.
Numerical simulations presented here, employing a 1D Vlasov-Maxwell code, show
that, although the amplification efficiency remains high when the pump only
mildly exceeds the wavebreaking threshold, the efficiency drops precipitously

scattering events determines the transition rate per unit time for electron

to the recent Maiani et al. calculations are made: (i) The Debye screening
length is only employed within its proper domain of validity. (ii) The WKB
approximation employed by Maiani in the long De Broglie wave length limit is
evidently invalid. We replace this incorrect approximation with mathematically
rigorous Calogero inequalities in order to discuss the scattering wave
