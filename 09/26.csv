symmetries, given a class of unitary mixing matrices. By creating explicit 3D
representations for generators of residual symmetries in both the charged
lepton and neutrino sector, we reconstruct large(r) non-abelian flavour groups
using the GAP language for computational finite algebra. We use experimental
data to construct only those generators that yield acceptable (or preferable)
mixing patterns. Such an approach is advantageous because it 1) can reproduce
known groups from other 'top-down' scans while elucidating their origins from
residuals, 2) find new previously unconsidered groups, and 3) serve as a
powerful model building tool for theorists wishing to explore exotic flavour
scenarios. We test our procedure on a generalization of the canonical
tri-bimaximal (TBM) form.

ranging from micron to centimeter size. Meteorites are evidence that individual
grains of those sizes were collected and assembled into planetesimals in the
young solar system. Aims. We assess the efficiency of dust collection of a
swarm of non-drifting planetesimals {\rev with radii ranging from 1 to
$10^3$\,km and beyond. Methods. We calculate the collision probability of dust
drifting in the disk due to gas drag by planetesimal accounting for several
regimes depending on the size of the planetesimal, dust, and orbital distance:
the geometric, Safronov, settling, and three-body regimes. We also include a
hydrodynamical regime to account for the fact that small grains tend to be
carried by the gas flow around planetesimals. Results. We provide expressions
for the collision probability of dust by planetesimals and for the filtering
efficiency by a swarm of planetesimals. For standard turbulence conditions
(i.e., a turbulence parameter $\alpha=10^{-2}$), filtering is found to be
inefficient, meaning that when crossing a minimum-mass solar nebula (MMSN) belt
of planetesimals extending between 0.1 AU and 35 AU most dust particles are
eventually accreted by the central star rather than colliding with
planetesimals. However, if the disk is weakly turbulent ($\alpha=10^{-4}$)
filtering becomes efficient in two regimes: (i) when planetesimals are all
smaller than about 10 km in size, in which case collisions mostly take place in
the geometric regime; and (ii) when planetary embryos larger than about 1000 km
in size dominate the distribution, have a scale height smaller than one tenth
of the gas scale height, and dust is of millimeter size or larger in which case
most collisions take place in the settling regime. These two regimes have very
different properties: we find that the local filtering efficiency
$x_{filter,MMSN}$ scales with $r^{-7/4}$ (where $r$ is the orbital distance) in
the geometric regime, but with $r^{-1/4}$ to $r^{1/4}$ in the settling regime.
This implies that the filtering of dust by small planetesimals should occur
close to the central star and with a short spread in orbital distances. On the
other hand, the filtering by embryos in the settling regime is expected to be
more gradual and determined by the extent of the disk of embryos. Dust
particles much smaller than millimeter size tend only to be captured by the
smallest planetesimals because they otherwise move on gas streamlines and their
collisions take place in the hydrodynamical regime. Conclusions. Our results
hint at an inside-out formation of planetesimals in the infant solar system
because small planetesimals in the geometrical limit can filter dust much more
efficiently close to the central star. However, even a fully-formed belt of
planetesimals such as the MMSN only marginally captures inward-drifting dust
and this seems to imply that dust in the protosolar disk has been filtered by
planetesimals even smaller than 1 km (not included in this study) or that it
has been assembled into planetesimals by other mechanisms (e.g., orderly
growth, capture into vortexes). Further refinement of our work concerns, among
other things: a quantitative description of the transition region between the
hydro and settling regimes; an assessment of the role of disk turbulence for
collisions, in particular in the hydro regime; and the coupling of our model to
a planetesimal formation model.

substrates is a challenge of significant technological importance. In the
present work, formation of ultra-thin gold films on fused silica is studied,
demonstrating how suppression of island formation and reduction of plasmonic
absorption can be achieved by treating substrates with (3-mercaptopropyl)
trimethoxysilane prior to deposition. Void-free fi lms with deposition
thickness as low as 5.4 nm are realized and remain structurally stable at room
temperature. Based on detailed structural analysis of the fi lms by specular
and diffuse X-ray reflectivity measurements, it is shown that optical
transmission properties of continuous ultra-thin films can be accounted for
using the bulk dielectric function of gold. However, it is important to take
into account the non-abrupt transition zone between the metal and the
surrounding dielectrics, which extends through several lattice constants for
the laterally continuous ultra-thin films (film thickness below 10 nm). This
results in a significant reduction of optical transmission, as compared to the
case of abrupt interfaces. These findings imply that the atomic-scale interface
structure plays an important role when continuous ultra-thin films are
considered, e.g., as semi-transparent electrical contacts, since optical
transmission deviates significantly from the theoretical predictions for ideal
films.

Once electrons are confined to low dimensions, they also tend to spontaneously

because of its relation to various unconventional electronic properties. In
this study we reveal a remarkable and surprising feature of charge density

linear combination map (ILC) of unmodeled emission from the galactic radio loop
known as Loop I. The statistically strongest result comes from a cluster
analysis that tests whether the ""hot spots"" within a $20^\circ$ annulus at Loop
I are preferentially located near the center line of the annulus. From this
cluster analysis the authors report a $p$-value of 0.018% when considering the
four highest bins (75-87 $\mu$K). I show that the reported statistical
significance has been overestimated. First, the analysis does not correctly
select the hot spots in the simulated sky realizations; second, it is sensitive
to the map pixelization used, and in particular, pixel size used is similar to
the relevant clustering distance. I have run 10,000 simulated sky realizations
to reproduce the analysis in Liu et al. and to calculate the effects of
incorrect hot spot selection and of pixelization. Accounting for both of these
effects, I find a corrected $p$-value of $\sim1\%$, both in the highest-bin
test and in the four-bin test. Finally, I note that even under the assumption
that Loop I contributes significant power to the ILC map, the observed
clustering remains very unlikely. Therefore, a result inconsistent with
statistical isotropy is not automatically strong evidence for a detection of
Loop I. I suggest additional tests that could clarify the degree to which the
cluster analysis supports a detection of Loop I in the CMB map.

flow of the elastic constants has three fixed points, two of which are trivial

case. Exploiting this relative simplicity has required detailed knowledge of
the physical system under study. In this work, we introduce a general and
efficient black box method for many-body quantum systems that utilizes
technology from compressed sensing to find the most compact wavefunction
possible without detailed knowledge of the system. It is a Multicomponent
Adaptive Greedy Iterative Compression (MAGIC) scheme. No knowledge is assumed
in the structure of the problem other than correct particle statistics. This
method can be applied to many quantum systems such as spins, qubits,
oscillators, or electronic systems. As an application, we use this technique to
compute ground state electronic wavefunctions of hydrogen fluoride and recover
98% of the basis set correlation energy or equivalently 99.996% of the total
energy with $50$ configurations out of a possible $10^7$. Building from this
compactness, we introduce the idea of nuclear union configuration interaction
for improving the description of reaction coordinates and use it to study the
dissociation of hydrogen fluoride and the helium dimer.

This article studies how surface tension changes the contact mechanics of a

examined the special case where the external load is zero, so contact is driven
by adhesion alone. Here, we tackle the much more complicated problem where, in
addition to adhesion, deformation is driven by an indentation force. We present
an exact solution based on small strain theory. The relation between
indentation force (displacement) and contact radius is found to depend on a
single dimensionless parameter: $\omega=\sigma(\mu R)^{-2/3}(9\pi
W_{\textrm{ad}}/4)^{-1/3}$, where $\sigma$ and $\mu$ are the surface tension
and shear modulus of the substrate, $R$ is the sphere radius, and
$W_{\textrm{ad}}$ is the interfacial work of adhesion. Our theory reduces to
the Johnson-Kendall-Roberts theory and Young-Dupr\'e equation in the limits of
small and large $\omega$ respectively, and compares well with existing
experimental data. Our results show that, although surface tension can
significantly affect the indentation force, the magnitude of the pull-off load
in the partial wetting liquid-like limit is reduced only by 1/3 compared with
the JKR limit, and the pull-off behavior is completely determined by $\omega$.

the backreaction on both the metric and the gauge field can be ignored. In this
approximation, it was shown that when a time dependent source for the order

to the initial gap, the dynamics in the critical region is dominated by a zero

show that this mechanism for emergence of scaling behavior continues to hold
without any self-coupling in the presence of backreaction of gauge field and

gravitational wake induced by a binary, whose center of mass moves at velocity
Vcm against a uniform background of gas. For simplicity, we assume that the
binary's components are on circular orbits about their common center of mass.
The consequences of dynamical friction is twofold. First, gas dynamical
friction may drag the binary's center of mass and cause the binary to migrate.
Second, drag forces also induce a braking torque, which causes the orbits of
the binary components to shrink. We compute the drag forces acting on one
component of the binary due to the gravitational interaction with its own wake.
We show that the dynamical friction force responsible to decelerate the
binary's center of mass is smaller than it is in the point-mass case because of
the loss of gravitational focusing. We show that the braking internal torque
depends on the Mach numbers of each binary component about their center of
mass, and also on the Mach number of the center of mass of the binary. In
general, the internal torque decreases with increasing the velocity of the
binary relative to the ambient gas cloud. However, this is not always the case.

only one bipolar AR is present on the Sun and it is fully covered by the
separatrix of a streamer, such as AR 10978 in December 2007, it seems unlikely
that the upflowing AR plasma can find its way into the slow SW. However,
signatures of plasma with AR composition have been found at 1 AU by Culhane et
al. (2014) apparently originating from the West of AR 10978. We present a
detailed topology analysis of AR 10978 and the surrounding large-scale corona
based on a potential-field source-surface (PFSS) model. Our study shows that it
is possible for the AR plasma to get around the streamer separatrix and be
released into the SW via magnetic reconnection, occurring in at least two main
steps. We analyse data from the Nan\c{c}ay Radioheliograph (NRH) searching for
evidence of the chain of magnetic reconnections proposed. We find a noise storm
above the AR and several varying sources at 150.9 MHz. Their locations suggest
that they could be associated with particles accelerated during the first-step
reconnection process and at a null point well outside of the AR. However, we
find no evidence of the second-step reconnection in the radio data. Our results
demonstrate that even when it appears highly improbable for the AR plasma to
reach the SW, indirect channels involving a sequence of reconnections can make
it possible.

arrive exogenously as a Poisson process and join a customer queue upon arrival

some exponentially distributed random time, and join an agent queue upon
invitation acceptance if no customer is waiting. A customer and an agent are
matched in the order of customer arrival and agent invitation acceptance under
the non-idling condition, and will leave the system simultaneously once matched
(service times are irrelevant here).
  We consider a feedback-based adaptive agent invitation scheme, which controls
the number of pending agent invitations, depending on the customer and/or agent
queue lengths and their changes. The system process has two components -- `the
difference between agent and customer queues' and `the number of pending
invitations', and is a countable continuous-time Markov chain.
  For the case when the customer arrival rate is constant, we establish fluid
and diffusion limits, in the asymptotic regime where the customer arrival rate
goes to infinity, while the agent response rate is fixed. We prove the process
stability and fluid-scale limit interchange, which in particular imply that
that both customer and agent waiting times in steady-state vanish in the
asymptotic limit. To do this we develop a novel (multi-scale) Lyapunov drift
argument; it is required because the process has non-trivial behavior on the
state space boundary. When the customer arrival rate is time-varying, we

Runeole software based on typical weather sequences analysis. It runs an
analysis process of a stochastic continuous multivariable phenomenon with
frequencies properties applied to a climatic database. The database analysis
associates basic statistics, PCA (Principal Component Analysis) and automatic
classifications. Different ways of applying these methods will be presented.
All the results are stored in the Runeole internal database that allows an easy
selection of weather sequences. The extreme sequences are used for system and
building sizing and the mean sequences are used for the determination of the
annual cooling loads as proposed by Audrier-Cros (Audrier-Cros, 1984). This
weather analysis was tested with the database of the French weather forecast
utility Meteo France. Reunion Island experiences a lot of different
micro-climates due to the high altitude (3069m), specific relief, and
geographic situation (Tropic of Capricorn). Furthermore Reunion Island has the
densest meteorological network in France and is an ideal place to validate the
methodology with different climates. To test the efficiency of such analysis,
simulations using the resulting weather sequences were carried out with the
building simulation software CODYRUN. This analysis is the first step of a more
global research concerning weather data generation. Future work will permit
whole hourly typical meteorological year generation using neural networks.

individual radial profiles of the stellar mass surface density ($\mu_{*}$),
stellar extinction (A$_{V}$), luminosity weighted ages ($\langle$ log age
$\rangle_{L}$), and mass weighted metallicity ($\langle$ log
Z/Z$_{\odot}$$\rangle_{M}$) are stacked in seven bins of galaxy morphology (E,
S0, Sa, Sb, Sbc, Sc and Sd). All these properties show negative gradients as a
sight of the inside-out growth of massive galaxies. However, the gradients
depend on the Hubble type in different ways. For the same galaxy mass, E and S0
galaxies show the largest inner gradients in $\mu_{*}$; and Andromeda-like
galaxies (Sb with log M$_{*}$(M$_{\odot}$) $\sim$ 11) show the largest inner
age and metallicity gradients. In average, spiral galaxies have a stellar
metallicity gradient $\sim$ -0.1 dex per half-light radius, in agreement with
the value estimated for the ionized gas oxygen abundance gradient by CALIFA. A
global (M$_{*}$-driven) and local ($\mu_{*}$- driven) stellar metallicity
relation are derived. We find that in disks, the stellar mass surface density
regulates the stellar metallicity; in spheroids, the galaxy stellar mass
dominates the physics of star formation and chemical enrichment.

flavour constraints by simply having a large spontaneous symmetry breaking
scale, f > 10 TeV. This produces a 'split' spectrum, where the strong sector
resonances have masses greater than 10 TeV and are separated from the pseudo
Nambu-Goldstone bosons, which remain near the electroweak scale. Even though a
tuning of order 10^{-4} is required to obtain the observed Higgs boson mass,
the big hierarchy problem remains mostly solved. Intriguingly, models with a
fully-composite right-handed top quark also exhibit improved gauge coupling
unification. By restricting ourselves to models which preserve these features
we find that the symmetry breaking scale cannot be arbitrarily raised, leading
to an upper bound f < 100-1000 TeV. This implies that the resonances may be
accessible at future colliders, or indirectly via rare-decay experiments. Dark
matter is identified with a pseudo Nambu-Goldstone boson, and we show that the
smallest coset space containing a stable, scalar singlet and an unbroken SU(5)

the naive convergence of perturbation theory for annihilation processes. An
effective field theory (EFT) framework is presented, allowing the systematic
resummation of these logarithms. Another impact of the large separation of
scales is that a long-distance wave-function distortion from electroweak boson
exchange leads to observable modifications of the cross section. Careful
accounting of momentum regions in the EFT allows the rigorously disentanglement
of this so-called Sommerfeld enhancement from the short distance hard
annihilation process. The WIMP is modeled as a heavy-particle field, while the
light, energetic, final-state electroweak gauge bosons are treated as soft and
collinear fields. Hard matching coefficients are computed at renormalization
scale $\mu \sim 2\,M$, then evolved down to $\mu \sim m_W$, where electroweak
symmetry breaking is incorporated and the matching onto the relevant quantum
mechanical Hamiltonian is performed. The example of an $SU(2)_W$ triplet scalar

acceleration mechanism remains poorly understood. Using two-dimensional (2D)
particle-in-cell (PIC) plasma simulations, we showed in Paper I that electrons
are efficiently accelerated in low Mach number (M=3) quasi-perpendicular shocks
via a Fermi-like process. The electrons bounce between the upstream region and
the shock front, with each reflection at the shock resulting in energy gain via
shock drift acceleration. The upstream scattering is provided by oblique
magnetic waves, that are self-generated by the electrons escaping ahead of the
shock. In the present work, we employ additional 2D PIC simulations to address
the nature of the upstream oblique waves. We find that the waves are generated
by the shock-reflected electrons via the firehose instability, which is driven
by an anisotropy in the electron velocity distribution. We systematically
explore how the efficiency of wave generation and of electron acceleration
depend on the magnetic field obliquity, the flow magnetization (or
equivalently, the plasma beta), and the upstream electron temperature. We find
that the mechanism works for shocks with high plasma beta (>20) at nearly all
magnetic field obliquities, and for electron temperatures in the range relevant
for galaxy clusters. Our findings offer a natural solution to the conflict
between the bright radio synchrotron emission observed from the outskirts of
galaxy clusters and the low electron acceleration efficiency usually expected
in low Mach number shocks.

(AMR) schemes. They are based on a kernel discretization of the volume coupled
to a high-order matrix gradient estimator and a Riemann solver acting over the
volume 'overlap.' We implement and test a parallel, second-order version of the

maintains exact mass, energy and momentum conservation; exhibits superior
angular momentum conservation compared to all other methods we study; does not
require 'artificial diffusion' terms; and allows the fluid elements to move

suite of test problems, and find that on all problems the new methods appear
competitive with moving-mesh schemes, with some advantages (particularly in
angular momentum conservation), at the cost of enhanced noise. The new methods
have many advantages vs. SPH: proper convergence, good capturing of
fluid-mixing instabilities, dramatically reduced 'particle noise' & numerical
viscosity, more accurate sub-sonic flow evolution, & sharp shock-capturing.
Advantages vs. non-moving meshes include: automatic adaptivity, dramatically
reduced advection errors & numerical overmixing, velocity-independent errors,
accurate coupling to gravity, good angular momentum conservation and
elimination of 'grid alignment' effects. We can, for example, follow hundreds
of orbits of gaseous disks, while AMR and SPH methods break down in a few
orbits. However, fixed meshes minimize 'grid noise.' These differences are
important for a range of astrophysical problems.

whether AGN play a role in galaxy evolution. Several theoretical models
implement AGN feedback to explain the observed galaxy luminosity function, and
possibly the color and morphological transformation of spiral galaxies into
passive ellipticals. To understand the importance of AGN feedback, a study of
the AGN populations in the radio-optical domain is crucial. A mass sequence
linking star-forming galaxies and AGN has been already noted in previous works,
and it is now investigated as possible evolutionary sequence. We observed a
sample of 119 intermediate-redshift (0.04<z<0.4) SDSS-FIRST radio emitters with
the Effelsberg 100-m telescope at 4.85 and 10.45 GHz and obtained spectral
indices. We find indications of spectral index flattening in high-metallicity
star-forming galaxies, composite galaxies, and Seyferts. This ""flattening
sequence"" along the [NII]-based emission-line diagnostic diagram is consistent
with the hardening of galaxy ionizing field, due to nuclear activity. After
combining our data with FIRST measurements at 1.4 GHz, we find that the
three-point radio spectra of Seyferts and LINERs show substantial differences,
attributable to small radio core components and larger (arcsecond sized)
jet/lobe components, respectively. A visual inspection of FIRST images seems to
confirm this hypothesis. Galaxies along this sequence are hypothesized to be
transitioning from the active star-forming galaxies (blue cloud) to the passive
elliptical galaxies (red sequence). This supports the suggestion that AGN play
a role in shutting down star-formation, and allow the transition from one
galaxy class to the other.

inflaton, which remains coupled to UV modes through a classical noise. We
compute slow-roll corrections to the evolution of UV modes (i.e. quantum
fluctuations), and track this effect from the UV theory to the IR theory, where
it manifests as a correction to the classical noise. We compute the stochastic
correction to the spectral index of primordial perturbations, finding a small
effect, and discuss models in which this effect can become large. We extend our
analysis to tensor modes, and demonstrate that the stochastic approach allows
us to recover the standard tensor tilt $n_T$, plus corrections.

optical spectra have been instrumental in processing the avalanche of data from
mega-surveys along the last decade, effectively transforming observed spectra
onto a long and rich list of physical properties: from stellar masses and mean
ages to full star formation histories. This promoted progress in our
understanding of galaxies as a whole. Yet, the lack of spatial resolution
introduces undesirable aperture effects, and hampers advances on the internal
physics of galaxies. This is now changing with 3D surveys. The mapping of
stellar populations in data-cubes allows us to figure what comes from where,
unscrambling information previously available only in integrated form. This
contribution uses our starlight-based analysis of 300 CALIFA galaxies to
illustrate the power of spectral synthesis applied to data-cubes. The selected
results highlighted here include: (a) The evolution of the mass-metallicity and
mass-density-metallicity relations, as traced by the mean stellar metallicity.

rely on high-level descriptions, sometimes called ""macrostates,""

include the thermodynamic properties of a large collection of point particles
undergoing reversible dynamics, the variables in a macroeconomic model
describing the individuals that participate in an economy, and the summary
state of a cell composed of a large set of biochemical networks.
  Often these high-level descriptions are constructed without considering the
ultimate reason for needing them in the first place. Here, we formalize and
quantify one such purpose: the need to predict observables of interest
concerning the high-dimensional system with as high accuracy as possible, while
minimizing the computational cost of doing so. The resulting State Space
Compression (SSC) framework provides a guide for how to solve for the {optimal}
high-level description of a given dynamical system, rather than constructing it
based on human intuition alone.
  In this preliminary report, we introduce SSC, and illustrate it with several
information-theoretic quantifications of ""accuracy"", all with different
implications for the optimal compression. We also discuss some other possible
applications of SSC beyond the goal of accurate prediction. These include SSC
as a measure of the complexity of a dynamical system, and as a way to quantify
information flow between the scales of a system.

Spectral energy distributions (SEDs) and images are obtained with the help of

central source spectrum and are caused by variations in the column densities of
the generated outflow. Due to the three-component morphology of the
hydrodynamical models -- a thin disc with high density filaments, a surrounding
fluffy component (the obscurer) and a low density outflow along the rotation

which the black hole represents a bound-state of many soft gravitons at the

perturbative amplitudes relevant for black hole formation. These are the
tree-level N-graviton scattering S-matrix elements in a kinematical regime
(called classicalization limit) where the two incoming ultra-Planckian
gravitons produce a large number N of soft gravitons. We compute these
amplitudes by using the Kawai-Lewellen-Tye relations, as well as scattering
equations and string theory techniques. We discover that this limit reveals the
key features of the microscopic corpuscular black hole N-portrait. In
particular, the perturbative suppression factor of a N-graviton final state,
derived from the amplitude, matches the non-perturbative black hole entropy
when N reaches the quantum criticality value, whereas final states with
different value of N are either suppressed or excluded by non-perturbative
corpuscular physics. Thus we identify the microscopic reason behind the black
hole dominance over other final states including non-black hole classical
object. In the parameterization of the classicalization limit the scattering
equations can be solved exactly allowing us to obtain closed expressions for
the high-energy limit of the open and closed superstring tree-level scattering
amplitudes for a generic number N of external legs. We demonstrate matching and
complementarity between the string theory and field theory in different large-s

""inference hierarchy"". When the underlying structure of an inference problem is
a commutative semiring -- i.e. a combination of two commutative semigroups with
the distributive law -- a message passing procedure called belief propagation
can leverage this distributive law to perform polynomial-time inference for
certain problems. After establishing the NP-hardness of inference in any
commutative semiring, we investigate the relation between algebraic properties
in this setting and further show that polynomial-time inference using
distributive law does not (trivially) extend to inference problems that are
expressed using more than two commutative semigroups. We then extend the
algebraic treatment of message passing procedures to survey propagation,
providing a novel perspective using a combination of two commutative semirings.

demanded by the need for infrared regularization via a non-zero photon mass, is
included. The appropriate value of the photon mass depends on experimental
conditions, and consequently the size of the electron (as defined by the slope
of its Dirac form factor) bound in a hydrogen atom is found to be about four
times larger than when the electron is free. The shape of the electron, as
determined from the transverse density and generalized parton distributions is
shown to not be round, and the free electron is shown to be far less round than

wavelength coverage will enable spectral differential imaging down to angular
separations of a few $\lambda/D$, corresponding to $\sim$$0.\!\!''1$. SCExAO
will also offer contrast approaching $10^{-5}$ at similar separations,

Our experimental laser provides a wavelength spacing tuning range from ~0.001
nm to 0.145 nm with a pump power variation less than 10 mW. The laser could be
developed into a low lost wavelength spacing tunable optical source for a wide
range of applications, such as spectroscopy, microwave/terahertz signal
generation, optical metrology, optical communications and sensing.

new clustering algorithms being proposed. However, in this context, the
determination of the number of clusters is rarely addressed. In this paper, we
propose a new approach in which clustering of categorical data and the
estimation of the number of clusters is carried out simultaneously. Assuming
that the data originate from a finite mixture of multinomial distributions, we
develop a method to select the number of mixture components based on a minimum
message length (MML) criterion and implement a new expectation-maximization
(EM) algorithm to estimate all the model parameters. The proposed EM-MML
approach, rather than selecting one among a set of pre-estimated candidate
models (which requires running EM several times), seamlessly integrates
estimation and model selection in a single algorithm. The performance of the
proposed approach is compared with other well-known criteria (such as the
Bayesian information criterion-BIC), resorting to synthetic data and to two
real applications from the European Social Survey. The EM-MML computation time
is a clear advantage of the proposed method. Also, the real data solutions are
much more parsimonious than the solutions provided by competing methods, which
reduces the risk of model order overestimation and increases interpretability.

leads to high pressures and an extensive distribution of natural fractures
which reduce the pressures. With time these fractures heal, sealing the
remaining oil and gas in place. High volume fracking opens the healed fractures
allowing the oil and gas to flow the horizontal productions wells. We model the
injection process using invasion percolation. We utilize a 2D square lattice of
bonds to model the sealed natural fractures. The bonds are assigned random
strengths and the fluid, injected at a point, opens the weakest bond adjacent
to the growing cluster of opened bonds. Our model exhibits burst dynamics in
which the clusters extends rapidly into regions with weak bonds. We associate
these bursts with the microseismic activity generated by fracking injections. A
principal object of this paper is to study the role of anisotropic stress
distributions. Bonds in the $y$-direction are assigned higher random strengths
than bonds in the $x$-direction. We illustrate the spatial distribution of

broadly compatible with the asymptotic theory to states of strongly increased

Third Law of Motion using colliding pendulums. To explain the differences

a mathematical scaffolding and recasting his geometrical reasoning in the

\sim v^2$.
  The solution of Diderot is presented in full detail and his results are
compared to those obtained from a Lindstedt-Poincare approximation for an
oscillator with quadratic damping. It is shown that, up to a prefactor, both
coincide. Some results that one can derive from his approach are presented and

distributions that can be generated at chaotic band-splitting points that
mediate between the aforementioned fixed-point distributions. Self affinity in
the chaotic region imprints scaling features to the crossover distributions
along the sequence of band splitting points. The trajectories that give rise to
these distributions are governed first by the sequential formation of
phase-space gaps when, initially uniformly-distributed, sets of trajectories
evolve towards the chaotic band attractors. Subsequently, the summation of
positions of trajectories already within the chaotic bands closes those gaps.

serves as an initial prior for stage II which alternates image reconstruction

collection of two-cells glued together along edges), and use this to fix a
gauge and reduce the Hamiltonian. The equations of motion for the fields
describe a dynamical triangulation where each vertex moves according to the
equation of motion for a free relativistic particle. The evolution is
continuous except for when triangles collapse (i.e. the edges become parallel)
causing discrete, topological changes in the underlying CW complex.
  We then introduce the loop gravity phase space parameterized by holonomy-flux
variables on a graph (a network of one-dimensional links). By embedding a graph
within the CW complex, we find a description of this system in terms of loop
variables. The resulting equations of motion describe the same dynamical
triangulation as the connection and frame-field variables. In this framework,
the collapse of a triangle causes a discrete change in the underlying graph,
giving a concrete realization of the graph-changing moves that many expect to
feature in full loop quantum gravity. The main result is a dynamical model of
loop gravity which agrees with general relativity and is well-suited for

Recent work by the authors introduced a general methodology for the
construction of estimators for functionals in parametric models, and
demonstrated improvements - both in theory and in practice - over the maximum
likelihood estimator (MLE), particularly in high dimensional scenarios
involving parameter dimension comparable to or larger than the number of
samples. This approach to estimation, building on results from approximation
theory, is shown to yield minimax rate-optimal estimators for a wide class of
functionals, implementable with modest computational requirements. In a
nutshell, a message of this recent work is that, for a wide class of
functionals, the performance of these essentially optimal estimators with $n$
samples is comparable to that of the MLE with $n \ln n$ samples.
  In the present paper, we highlight the applicability of the aforementioned
methodology to statistical problems beyond functional estimation, and show that
it can yield substantial gains. For example, we demonstrate that for learning
tree-structured graphical models, our approach achieves a significant reduction
of the required data size compared with the classical Chow--Liu algorithm,
which is an implementation of the MLE, to achieve the same accuracy. The key
step in improving the Chow--Liu algorithm is to replace the empirical mutual
information with the estimator for mutual information proposed by the authors.
Further, applying the same replacement approach to classical Bayesian network
classification, the resulting classifiers uniformly outperform the previous
classifiers on 26 widely used datasets.

temperature, in terms of spectral asymmetry and spectral flow. It is shown that
$L_z=\nu N/2$ for any integer $\nu$, in the BEC regime. In contrast, in the BCS
limit, while the OAM is $L_z=N/2$ for the $p+ip$-wave SF, for chiral SF with
$\nu\geq2$, the OAM is remarkably suppressed as $L_z=N\times
O(\Delta_0/\varepsilon_F)\ll N$, where $\Delta_0$ is the gap amplitude and
$\varepsilon_F$ is the Fermi energy. We demonstrate that the difference between
the $p+ip$-wave SF and the other chiral SFs in the BCS regimes originates from
the nature of edge modes and related depairing effects.

hybrid inflation, together with a new linear term for the inflaton field which
is induced by large gravitino mass, is shown to be consistent with all

the weak scale we find that the reheating temperature after inflation might be
beneath the value required by thermal leptogenesis if the inflaton decays to
its products perturbatively, but above it if non-perturbatively instead.
Remarkably, the gravitino overproduction can be evaded in such high-scale
supersymmetry because of the kinematically blocking effect.

deposition, diffusion and volume conservation. We show how the diffusion
process is related to antisymmetric contribution and the volume conservation
process is related to symmetric contribution, which renormalizes to zero in the
coarse-grained limit. In another approach, we find the coefficients of the
continuous Langevin equation, by regularizing the discrete Langevin equation.
Finally, in a third approach, we derive these coefficients from the set of test
functions supported by the stationary probability density function (SPDF) of
the discrete model. The applicability of the used approaches to other discrete

time-dependent regulator for pilot-wave dynamics, where the regulator is
introduced to eliminate phase singularities. Applying our model to
trans-Planckian modes that exit the Planck radius, we calculate the corrected

beam and the high-precision measurement of the mixing angle $\theta_{13}$ have
led to a re-evaluation of the physics potential of the T2K long-baseline
neutrino oscillation experiment. Sensitivities are explored for CP violation in
neutrinos, non-maximal $\sin^22\theta_{23}$, the octant of $\theta_{23}$, and
the mass hierarchy, in addition to the measurements of $\delta_{CP}$,
$\sin^2\theta_{23}$, and $\Delta m^2_{32}$, for various combinations of
$\nu$-mode and \(\bar{\nu}\)-mode data-taking.
  With an exposure of $7.8\times10^{21}$~protons-on-target, T2K can achieve
1-$\sigma$ resolution of 0.050(0.054) on $\sin^2\theta_{23}$ and
$0.040(0.045)\times10^{-3}~\rm{eV}^2$ on $\Delta m^2_{32}$ for 100\%(50\%)
neutrino beam mode running assuming $\sin^2\theta_{23}=0.5$ and $\Delta
m^2_{32} = 2.4\times10^{-3}$ eV$^2$. T2K will have sensitivity to the
CP-violating phase $\delta_{\rm{CP}}$ at 90\% C.L. or better over a significant
range. For example, if $\sin^22\theta_{23}$ is maximal (i.e
$\theta_{23}$=$45^\circ$) the range is $-115^\circ<\delta_{\rm{CP}}<-60^\circ$
for normal hierarchy and $+50^\circ<\delta_{\rm{CP}}<+130^\circ$ for inverted
hierarchy. When T2K data is combined with data from the NO$\nu$A experiment,
the region of oscillation parameter space where there is sensitivity to observe
a non-zero $\delta_{CP}$ is substantially increased compared to if each
experiment is analyzed alone.

memory can then be switched between writing/read-out mode and storage mode

research topic in the field of surveying and mapping. Most existing methods are
devoted to handling just one type of object and little attention has been paid
to improving the computational efficiency. In recent years, level set evolution
(LSE) has been shown to be very promising for object extraction in the
community of image processing and computer vision because it can handle
topological changes automatically while achieving high accuracy. However, the
application of state-of-the-art LSEs is compromised by laborious parameter
tuning and expensive computation. In this paper, we proposed two fast LSEs for
man-made object extraction from high spatial resolution remote sensing images.
The traditional mean curvature-based regularization term is replaced by a
Gaussian kernel and it is mathematically sound to do that. Thus a larger time
step can be used in the numerical scheme to expedite the proposed LSEs. In
contrast to existing methods, the proposed LSEs are significantly faster. Most
importantly, they involve much fewer parameters while achieving better
performance. The advantages of the proposed LSEs over other state-of-the-art
approaches have been verified by a range of experiments.

progressively cools and contracts with a rate of energy loss inversely
proportional to the planetary age. The combined measurement of planetary mass,
radius and a constraint on the (stellar) age enables a global determination of
the amount of heavy elements present in the planet interior. The comparison
with stellar metallicity shows a correlation between the two, indicating that
accretion played a crucial role in the formation of planets. The dynamical
evolution of exoplanets also depends on the properties of the central star. We
show that the lack of massive giant planets and brown dwarfs in close orbit

different properties of dissipation in the stellar interiors. Both the

model by augmenting it with few standard layers and a simple new gradient
reversal layer. The resulting augmented architecture can be trained using
standard backpropagation.
  Overall, the approach can be implemented with little effort using any of the
deep-learning packages. The method performs very well in a series of image
classification experiments, achieving adaptation effect in the presence of big
domain shifts and outperforming previous state-of-the-art on Office datasets.

geodesic X-ray transform where geodesics are replaced with broken rays that
reflect on a part of the boundary. The fundamental question is whether this
transform is injective. We employ four different methods to approach this
question, and each of them gives interesting results.
  Direct calculation can be used in a ball, where the geometry is particularly
simple. If the reflecting part of the boundary is (piecewise) flat, a
reflection argument can be used to reduce the problem to the usual X-ray
transform. In some geometries one can use broken rays near the boundary to
determine the values of the unknown function at the reflector, and even
construct its Taylor series. One can also use energy estimates -- which in this
context are known as Pestov identities -- to show injectivity in the presence
of one convex reflecting obstacle. Many of these methods work also on
Riemannian manifolds.
  We also discuss the periodic broken ray transform, where the integrals are
taken over periodic broken rays. The broken ray transform and its periodic
version have applications in other inverse problems, including Calder\'on's
problem and problems related to spectral geometry.

Proteins that induce membrane curvature play a key role in such processes,
mostly by adsorbing to the membrane and forming a scaffold that deforms the
membrane according to the curvature of the proteins. In this paper we explore
the possibility of membrane tube destabilisation through a pearling mechanism
enabled by the combined effects of the adsorbed curved proteins and the actin

as the initiation for fission of the tube into vesicles. We find that adsorbed

ray induced ionization in the atmosphere is achieved. Basically, the models are
full target, i.e. based on Monte Carlo simulation of an
electromagnetic-muon-nucleon cascade in the atmosphere. In general, the
contribution of proton nuclei in those models is highlighted, i.e. primary
cosmic ray $\alpha$-particles and heavy nuclei are neglected or scaled to
protons. The development of cosmic ray induced atmospheric cascade is sensitive
to the energy and mass of the primary cosmic ray particle. The largest
uncertainties in Monte Carlo simulations of a cascade in the Earth atmosphere
are due to assumed hadron interaction models, the so-called hadron generators.
In the work presented here we compare the ionization yield functions $Y$ for
primary cosmic ray nuclei, such as protons, $\alpha$-particles, Oxygen and Iron
nuclei, assuming different hadron interaction models. The computations are
fulfilled with the CORSIKA 6.9 code using GHEISHA 2002, FLUKA 2011, UrQMD
hadron generators for energy below 80 GeV/nucleon and QGSJET II for energy
above 80 GeV/nucleon. The observed difference between hadron generators is
widely discussed. The influence of different atmospheric parametrizations,
namely US standard atmosphere, US standard atmosphere winter and summer
profiles on ion production rate is studied. Assuming realistic primary cosmic
ray mass composition, the ion production rate is obtained at several rigidity
cut-offs - from 1 GV (high latitudes) to 15 GV (equatorial latitudes) using
various hadron generators. The computations are compared with experimental
data. A conclusion concerning the consistency of the hadron generators is
stated.

of WRs. The detected emission in the so-called blue bump is attributed mainly
to late-type nitrogen WRs (WNL), ranging from a few dozens to several hundreds
of stars per region. Our estimated WNL/(WNL+O) ratio is comparable to reported
empirical relations once the extinction-corrected emission is further corrected
by the presence of dust grains inside the nebula that absorb a non-negligible
fraction of UV photons. Comparisons of observables with stellar population
models show disagreement by factors larger than 2-3. However, if the effects of
interacting binaries and/or photon leakage are taken into account, observations
and predictions tend to converge. We estimate the binary fraction of the \hii
regions hosting WRs to be significant in order to recover the observed X-ray
flux, hence proving that the binary channel can be critical when predicting
observables. We also explore the connection of the environment with the current
hypothesis that WRs can be progenitors to long-duration gamma-ray bursts
(GRBs). Galaxy interactions, which can trigger strong episodes of star
formation in the central regions, may be a plausible environment where WRs may
act as progenitors of GRBs. Finally, even though the chemical abundance is
generally homogeneous, we also find weak evidence for rapid N pollution by WR
stellar winds at scales of ~ 200 pc.

are such that the dynamics is completely determined by the number of

via choice of a suitable coupling function and (b) open sets of coupling
functions can generate heteroclinic network attractors between cluster states

relationship between the coupling function and the dynamics. We focus on cases
where the clusters are inequivalent in the sense of not being related by a
temporal symmetry, and demonstrate that there are coupling functions that give
robust heteroclinic networks between periodic states involving three or more
nontrivial clusters. We consider an example for N=6 oscillators where the
clustering is into three inequivalent clusters. We also discuss some aspects of
the bifurcation structure for periodic multi-cluster states and show that the
transverse stability of inequivalent clusters can, to a large extent, be varied

supernova explosions, coincident with substantial brightening in soft X-ray

approaching the momentum-conserving snowplow limit. This and enhanced radiative

Bianchi identities which strongly constrain the flow. We show that requiring
that the SU(3) structure torsion is preserved along the path leads to
constraints on the G2 torsion and the embedding of X in Y. Furthermore, we
study flows along which the torsion classes of X go from zero to non-zero
values. In particular, we present evidence that the flow of half-flat SU(3)
structures may contain Calabi-Yau loci, in the presence of non-vanishing
H-flux.

nontrivial periodic solutions. The elements of this important, widely-used
model class typically consist of two coupled advection-diffusion-reaction
equations. The corresponding reaction terms are divided into a linear part,
describing the transformation of one model variable into the other, and a
bounded nonlinear part. Additionally, the model equations conserve the mass
contained in the system, i.e. the masses of both variables add up to a constant
total mass. In particular, the trivial function is a periodic solution. In this
paper, we prove that there is at least one periodic solution for every
prescribed total mass. The proof makes use of the typical properties of N-DOP

loss rate is unusually sensitive to the very definition of the string theory

significant jet quenching, even in the absence of plasma. By renormalizing the

clarify the evolutionary stage of this peculiar object, and to study the CO
molecular component of its circumstellar medium. To this purpose, we modeled
the CO molecular bands using high-resolution K-band spectra. We find that MWC
137 is surrounded by a detached cool (T = 1900 +-100 K) and dense (N = (3 +- 1)
x 10^21 cm^(-2)) ring of CO gas orbiting the star with a rotational velocity,
projected to the line of sight, of 84 +- 2 km/s. We also find that the
molecular gas is enriched in the isotope 13C, excluding the classification of
the star as a Herbig Be. The observed isotopic abundance ratio (12C / 13C = 25
+- 2) derived from our modeling is compatible with a proto-PN, main-sequence or
supergiant evolutionary phase. However, based on some observable
characteristics of MWC 137, we propose that the supergiant scenario seems to be
the most plausible. Hence, we suggest that MWC 137 could be in an extremely
short-lived phase, evolving from a B[e] supergiant to a blue supergiant with a

common task in experimental design or when exploring an unknown environment in

minimizing the expected entropy is therefore a standard method for choosing
samples in order to gain strong beliefs about the underlying random variables.
We show that this approach is prone to temporally getting stuck in local optima
corresponding to wrongly biased beliefs. We suggest instead maximizing the
expected cross entropy between old and new belief, which aims at challenging
refutable beliefs and thereby avoids these local optima. We show that both
criteria are closely related and that their difference can be traced back to
the asymmetry of the Kullback-Leibler divergence. In illustrative examples as

cross entropy over simple entropy for practical applications.

hexagonal ice. The simulations are based on a force field for flexible
molecules and span a time interval of up to 50 {\mu}s at a temperature of 100
K, which represents a lower bound to the temperature range of Earth's
atmosphere. Additional calculations using both density functional theory and an
ab initio based polarizable potential function are performed to test and refine
the force field predictions. Several distinct processes are found to occur
readily even at this low temperature, including concerted reorientation
(flipping) of neighboring surface molecules, which changes the pattern of
dangling H-atoms, and the formation of interstitial defects by the downwards
motion of upper-bilayer molecules. On the proton-disordered surface, one major
surface roughening process is observed that significantly disrupts the
crystalline structure. Despite much longer simulation time, such roughening
processes are not observed on the highly ordered Fletcher surface which is
energetically more stable because of smaller repulsive interaction between
neighboring dangling H-atoms. However, a more localized process takes place on
the Fletcher surface involving a surface molecule transiently leaving its
lattice site. The flipping process provides a facile pathway of increasing
proton-order and stabilizing the surface, supporting a predominantly
Fletcher-like ordering of low-temperature ice surfaces, but our simulations
also show that proton- disordered patches on the surface may induce significant
local reconstructions. Further, a subset of the molecules on the Fletcher
surface are susceptible to forming interstitial defects.

that are assumed to be holographically dual to heavy ions collisions. Our main
physical assumption is that we can make a restriction on the time of a trapped
surface production that makes a natural limitation on the size of the domain
where the trapped surface is produced. This limits the intermediate domain
where the main part of the entropy is produced. In this domain one can use an
intermediate vacuum background as an approximation to the full confining
background. In this intermediate background a dependence of the produced
entropy on colliding energy is very similar to the experimental dependence of
particles multiplicities on colliding ions energy obtained from RHIC and LHC.
This permits us to conclude that the entropy produced in collisions of domain

In particular, we discuss the prediction of the Higgs mass according to the

experiment. To remedy this problem, we extend the formalism to the superalgebra
su(2/2), which extends the SM to the left-right symmetric model (LRSM) and
accommodates a ~126 GeV Higgs. Both the SM in the su(2/1) case and the LRSM in
the su(2/2) case are argued to emerge at ~4 TeV from an underlying theory in
which the spacetime geometry is modified by the addition of a discrete extra
dimension. The formulation of the exterior derivative in this model space
suggests a deep connection between the modified geometry, which can be
described in the language of non-commutative geometry (NCG), and the
spontaneous breaking of the gauge symmetries. The implication is that
spontaneous symmetry breaking could actually be geometric/quantum gravitational
in nature. The non-decoupling phenomenon seen in the Higgs sector can then be
reinterpreted in a new light as due to the mixing of low energy (SM) physics
and high energy physics associated with quantum gravity, such as string theory.
The phenomenology of a TeV scale LRSM is also discussed, and we argue that some
exciting discoveries may await us at the LHC, and other near-future
experiments.

the energy efficiency as a function of the cell density has a global maximum

perpendicular anisotropy. We study the behavior of the dipolar frustrated Ising
model in a mean field approximation as well as two other models with simple
domain walls. By a numerical analysis we show that the internal degrees of
freedom of the domain walls are decisive for the presence of the inverse
symmetry breaking transition. In particular, we show that in a sharp domain
wall model the inverse transition is absent. At high temperatures the
additional degrees of freedom of the extended domain walls increase the entropy
of the system leading to a reduction of the free energy of the stripe phase.
Upon lowering the temperature the domain walls become narrow and with the
corresponding degrees of freedom effectively frozen, which eventually induces
an inverse transition to the competing homogeneous phase. We also show that,
for growing external field at constant temperature, the stripe width grows
strongly when approaching the critical field line and diverges at the
transition. These results indicate that the inverse transition is a continuous
phase transition and that the domain wall profiles as well as the temperature
has little effect on the critical behavior of the period of the domain as
function of the applied field.

Distribution (QKD) whose function is to sift out the undetected original keys.
The communication traffic of bit sifting has essential impact on the net secure
key rate of a practical QKD system, and it is facing unprecedented challenges
with the fast increase of the repetition frequency of quantum channel. In this
paper, we present an efficient bit sifting scheme whose core is a lossless
source coding algorithm. Both theoretical analysis and experimental results
demonstrate that the performance of our scheme is approaching the Shannon
limit. Our scheme can greatly decrease the communication traffic of the
post-processing of a QKD system, which means it can decrease the secure key
consumption for classical channel authentication and increase the net secure
key rate of the QKD system. Meanwhile, it can relieve the storage pressure of
the system greatly, especially the device at Alice side. Some recommendations
on the application of our scheme to some representative practical QKD systems

formation efficiency in turbulent molecular clouds. The model is based on the
assumption of log-normal density distribution which reflects the turbulent

cloud cores, which follows a Salpeter-like core mass function (CMF), and the
minimum mass for the collapse of individual cloud cores, given by the local
Jeans mass, we are able to derive the SFE for clouds as a function of their
Jeans masses. We find a very generic power-law, SFE \propto

for clouds in a number of hot Jupiters. In order to better characterise
planetary atmospheres we need to consider the effects these clouds will have on
the observed broadband transmission spectra. Here we examine the expected cloud
condensate species for hot Jupiter exoplanets and the effects of various grain
sizes and distributions on the resultant transmission spectra from the optical
to infrared, which can be used as a broad framework when interpreting exoplanet
spectra. We note that significant infrared absorption features appear in the
computed transmission spectrum, the result of vibrational modes between the key
species in each condensate, which can potentially be very constraining. While
it may be hard to differentiate between individual condensates in the broad
transmission spectra, it may be possible to discern different vibrational
bonds, which can distinguish between cloud formation scenarios such as
condensate clouds or photochemically generated species. Vibrational mode
features are shown to be prominent when the clouds are composed of small
sub-micron sized particles and can be associated with an accompanying optical
scattering slope. These infrared features have potential implications for
future exoplanetary atmosphere studies conducted with JWST, where such
vibrational modes distinguishing condensate species can be probed at longer

dependency, cognitive level). These multivariate and longitudinal data also
usually have nonstandard distributions (discrete, asymmetric, bounded,...). We
propose a joint model based on a latent process and latent classes to analyze
simultaneously such multiple longitudinal markers of different natures, and
multiple causes of progression. A latent process model describes the latent
trait of interest and links it to the observed longitudinal outcomes using
flexible measurement models adapted to different types of data, and a latent
class structure links the longitudinal and the cause-specific survival models.

is developed to evaluate the assumption of conditional independence of the
longitudinal markers and each cause of progression given the latent classes. In
addition, individual dynamic cumulative incidences of each cause of progression

and can be used to investigate the connections between angular-momentum
evolution and magnetic activity over a star's lifetime. We present the results
of a comparative study of the relationship between stellar rotation and
activity in two benchmark open clusters: Praesepe and the Hyades. As they have
the same age and roughly solar metallicity, these clusters serve as an ideal
laboratory for testing the agreement between theoretical and empirical
rotation-activity relations at $\approx$600 Myr. We have compiled a sample of
720 spectra --- more than half of which are new observations --- for 516
high-confidence members of Praesepe; we have also obtained 139 new spectra for
130 high-confidence Hyads. We have collected rotation periods ($P_{rot}$) for
135 Praesepe members and 87 Hyads. To compare $H\alpha$ emission, an indicator
of chromospheric activity, as a function of color, mass, and Rossby number
$R_o$, we first calculate an expanded set of $\chi$ values, with which we can
obtain the $H\alpha$ to bolometric luminosity ratio, $L_{H\alpha}/L_{bol}$,
even when spectra are not flux-calibrated and/or stars lack reliable distances.
Our $\chi$ values cover a broader range of stellar masses and colors (roughly
equivalent to spectral types from K0 to M9), and exhibit better agreement
between independent calculations, than existing values. We find no difference
between the two clusters in their $H\alpha$ equivalent width or
$L_{H\alpha}/L_{bol}$ distributions, and therefore take the merged $H\alpha$
and $P_{rot}$ data to be representative of 600-Myr-old stars. Our analysis
shows that $H\alpha$ activity in these stars is saturated for
$R_o\leq0.11^{+0.02}_{-0.03}$. Above that value activity declines as a
power-law with slope $\beta=-0.73^{+0.16}_{-0.12}$, before dropping off rapidly
at $R_o\approx0.4$...

average and the fluctuations of the synaptic currents acting on the single

microscopic stability of the diluted network can be also reproduced, as

explanation for some debris discs displaying pronounced asymmetries or having a
great luminosity excess. So far, no thorough modelling of the consequences of
such events has been carried out, mainly because of the extreme numerical
challenge of coupling the dynamical and collisional evolution of dust.
  We perform the first fully self-consistent modelling of the aftermath of
massive breakups in debris discs. We follow the collisional and dynamical
evolution of dust released after the breakup of a Ceres-sized body at 6 AU from
its central star. We investigate the duration, magnitude and spatial structure
of the signature left by such a violent event, as well as its observational
detectability.
  We use the recently developed LIDT-DD code (Kral et al., 2013), which handles
the coupled collisional and dynamical evolution of debris discs. The main focus
is placed on the complex interplay between destructive collisions, Keplerian
dynamics and radiation pressure forces. We use the GRaTer package to estimate
the system's luminosity at different wavelengths.
  The breakup of a Ceres-sized body at 6 AU creates an asymmetric dust disc
that is homogenized, by the coupled action of collisions and dynamics, on a
timescale of a few $10^5$ years. The luminosity excess in the breakup's
aftermath should be detectable by mid-IR photometry, from a 30 pc distance,
over a period of $\sim 10^6$ years that exceeds the duration of the asymmetric
phase of the disc (a few $10^5$ years). As for the asymmetric structures, we
derive synthetic images for the SPHERE/VLT and MIRI/JWST instruments, showing
that they should be clearly visible and resolved from a 10 pc distance. Images
at 1.6$\mu$m (marginally), 11.4 and 15.5$\mu$m would show the inner disc
structures while 23$\mu$m images would display the outer disc asymmetries.

subset $K \subseteq V$ of \emph{terminals}, a vector $p=(p_1,...,p_m) \in
[0,1]^m$ and a positive integer $d$, called \emph{diameter}. We assume nodes
are perfect but links fail stochastically and independently, with probabilities
$q_i=1-p_i$. The \emph{diameter-constrained reliability} (DCR for short), is
the probability that the terminals of the resulting subgraph remain connected
by paths composed by $d$ links, or less. This number is denoted by
$R_{K,G}^{d}(p)$. The general computation of the parameter $R_{K,G}^{d}(p)$
belongs to the class of $\mathcal{N}\mathcal{P}$-Hard problems, since is
subsumes the complexity that a random graph is connected.
  A discussion of the computational complexity for DCR-subproblems is provided
in terms of the number of terminal nodes $k=|K|$ and diameter $d$. Either when
$d=1$ or when $d=2$ and $k$ is fixed, the DCR is inside the class $\mathcal{P}$
of polynomial-time problems. The DCR turns $\mathcal{N}\mathcal{P}$-Hard even
if $k \geq 2$ and $d\geq 3$ are fixed, or in an all-terminal scenario when
$d=2$. The traditional approach is to design either exponential exact
algorithms or efficient solutions for particular graph classes.
  The contributions of this paper are two-fold. First, a new recursive class of
graphs are shown to have efficient DCR computation. Second, we define a
factorization method in order to develop an exact DCR computation in general.
The approach is inspired in prior works related with the determination of
irrelevant links and deletion-contraction formula.

stationary in the ground state of the hydrogen atom, because the quantum force

paper it is shown that classical electrodynamics similarly predicts the Coulomb
force can be effectively canceled by part of the magnetic force that occurs
between two similar particles each consisting of a point charge moving with
circulatory motion at the speed of light. Supposition of such motion is the
basis of the {\em Zitterbewegung} interpretation of quantum mechanics. The
magnetic force between two luminally-circulating charges for separation large
compared to their circulatory motions contains a radial inverse square law part
with magnitude equal to the Coulomb force, sinusoidally modulated by the phase
difference between the circulatory motions. When the particles have equal mass
and their circulatory motions are aligned but out of phase, part of the
magnetic force is equal but opposite the Coulomb force. This raises a
possibility that the quantum force of Bohmian mechanics may be attributable to
the magnetic force of classical electrodynamics. It is further shown that
non-relativistic relative motion between the particles leads to modulation of
the magnetic force with spatial period equal to the de Broglie wavelength.

away from TCE was found using an agarose in-plug bridge method. A second

quickly colonized the sand layer, thereby enhancing the initial TCE DNAPL
