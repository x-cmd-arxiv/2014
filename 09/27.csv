  Hilbert Spaces","16 pages",,,,"math.FA math.NA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In recent years, a series of convergence rates conditions for regularization
methods has been developed. Mainly, the motivations for developing novel
conditions came from the desire to carry over convergence rates results from
the Hilbert space setting to generalized Tikhonov regularization in Banach
spaces. For instance, variational source conditions have been developed and
they were expected to be equivalent to standard source conditions for linear
inverse problems in a Hilbert space setting. We show that this expectation does
not hold. However, in the standard Hilbert space setting these novel conditions
are optimal, which we prove by using some deep results from Neubauer, and
generalize existing convergence rates results. The key tool in our analysis is
a novel source condition, which we put into relation to the existing source
conditions from the literature. As a positive by-product, convergence rates
results can be proven without spectral theory, which is the standard technique
for proving convergence rates for linear inverse problems in Hilbert spaces.

share only few connections to the rest of the network. The aim of this research
is the development and evaluation of an efficient algorithm for detection of
overlapping, fuzzy communities. The algorithm gets as input some members of
each community that we aim to discover. We call these members seed nodes. The
algorithm then propagates this information by using random walks that start at
non-seed nodes and end as they reach a seed node. The probability that a random
walk starting at a non-seed node $v$ ends at a seed node $s$ is then equated
with the probability that $v$ belongs to the communities of $s$. The algorithm
runs in time $\tilde{O}(l \cdot m \cdot \log n)$, where $l$ is the number of
communities to detect, $m$ is the number of edges, $n$ is the number of nodes.
The $\tilde{O}$-notation hides a factor of at most $(\log \log n)^2$. The LFR
benchmark proposed by Lancichinetti et al.\ is used to evaluate the performance
of the algorithm. We found that, given a good set of seed nodes, it is able to
reconstruct the communities of a network in a meaningful manner.

the ISM and the metal-rich SN ejecta using 3D hydrodynamic simulations, in
which the feedback energy is deposited by SNeII exploding in distinct OB
associations. We found that a circulation flow similar to galactic fountains is
generally established, with some ISM lifted at heights of one to few kpc above
the galactic plane. This gas forms an extra-planar layer, which falls back to
the plane in about $10^8$ yr, once the star formation stops. Very little or no
ISM is expelled outside the galaxy system for the considered SFRs, even though
in the most powerful model the SN energy is comparable to the gas binding
energy. The metal-rich SN ejecta is instead more vulnerable to the feedback and
we found that a significant fraction (25-80\%) is vented in the intergalactic
medium, even for low SN rate ($7\times 10^{-5}$ - $7\times 10^{-4}$ yr$^{-1}$).
About half of the metals retained by the galaxy are located far ($z >$ 500 pc)

the chemical gradients imprinted by the (centrally concentrated) SN explosions.

Combinatorial optimization approaches can deliver optimal solutions according

penalty is equal to the typical magnitude of free energy fluctuations in the

the entropic droplet picture is indeed not only internally-consistent but is
also fully constructive, consistent with the apparent success of its many
quantitative predictions. A simple view of a glassy liquid as a locally
metastable, degenerate pattern of frozen-in stress emerges in the present
description. Finally, we derive testable relationships between the bulk modulus
and several characteristics of glassy liquids and peculiarities in
low-temperature glasses.

signomials, which are weighted sums of exponentials composed with linear

general, and families of NP-hard problems can be reduced to SPs. In this paper
we describe a hierarchy of convex relaxations to obtain successively tighter
lower bounds of the optimal value of SPs. This sequence of lower bounds is
computed by solving increasingly larger-sized relative entropy optimization
problems, which are convex programs specified in terms of linear and relative
entropy functions. Our approach relies crucially on the observation that the
relative entropy function -- by virtue of its joint convexity with respect to
both arguments -- provides a convex parametrization of certain sets of globally
nonnegative signomials with efficiently computable nonnegativity certificates

theorems from real algebraic geometry, we show that our sequences of lower

demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods via numerical experiments.

  Quarterly",,,,"astro-ph.EP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Outbursts are known to begin with a sudden appearance and steep brightening
of a ""stellar nucleus"" --- an unresolved image of a plume of material on its
way from the comet's surface and an initial stage of an expanding halo of
ejecta. Since the brightness of this feature is routinely reported, together
with astrometry, by most comet observers as the ""nuclear magnitude,"" it is
straightforward to determine the onset time, a fundamental parameter of any
outburst, by inspecting the chronological lists of such observations for a
major jump in the nuclear brightness. Although it is inadmissible to mix
nuclear magnitudes by different observers without first carefully examining
their compatibility, the time constraints obtained from data sets reported by
different observers can readily be combined. The intersection of these sets
provides the tightest possible constraint on the outburst's onset time. Applied
to comet 168P/Hergenrother during its 2012 return to perihelion, three
outbursts were detected and their timing determined with good to excellent
accuracy. Six fragmentation events experienced by the comet are shown to have
occurred in the same period of time as the outbursts. Three companions are
likely to have broken off from the primary in the first outburst, two
companions in the second outburst, and one companion in the last outburst. All
companions were short-lived, belonging to the class of excessively brittle
fragments. Yet, the results suggest that most of the mass lost in the first
outburst remained relatively intact during the liftoff, while the opposite was
the case in the last outburst.

5 Hz, remarkably similar to a giant flare QPO observed from SGR 1900+14. This
QPO fits naturally within the framework of global magneto-elastic torsional
oscillations employed to explain the giant flare QPOs. Additionally, we uncover
a limit on the applicability of Fourier analysis for light curves with low
background count rates and strong variability on short timescales. In this
regime, standard Fourier methodology and more sophisticated Fourier analyses
fail in equal parts by yielding an unacceptably large number of false positive
detections. This problem is not straightforward to solve in the Fourier domain.
Instead, we show how simulations of light curves can offer a viable solution

the context of the huge amount of already accumulated material from
ground-based instruments, including high- resolution spectra of off-limb
spicules. Results. The surge-like behavior of solar polar region spicules
supports the untwisting multi-component interpretation of spicules exhibiting
helical dynamics. Several tall spicules are found with (i) upward and downward
flows similar at lower and middle-levels, the rate of upward motion being
slightly higher at high levels; (ii) the left and right-hand velocities are
also increasing with height; (iii) a large number of multi-component spicules
show shearing motion of both left-handed and right-handed senses occurring
simultaneously, which might be understood as twisting (or untwisting) threads.
The number of turns depends on the overall diameter of the structure made of
components and changes from at least one turn for the smallest structure to at
most two or three turns for surge-like broad structures; the curvature along

shows that Frobenius' condition is not sufficient to derive the global
isotropic realizability in R^3. However, assuming that (j, curl j, j x curl j)

from a combination of the three dynamical flows along the directions j/|j|,
curl j/|curl j| and (j/|j|^2) x curl j. When the field j is periodic, the

high-order couplings. As a natural extension, we demonstrate enhancement of the

single frequency or dual frequencies. We assess the high-order Bragg reflection

time-propagation as well as the semi-classical theory exploited earlier by the

demonstrate that such an adhesion layer plays a vital role in the electrical

atmospheres is a long-standing problem, one that cannot satisfactorily be
explained by the historically-favoured hypothesis of accretion from the
interstellar medium. Here we explore the possibility that the gradual accretion
of exo-Oort cloud comets, which are a rich source of H, contributes to the
apparent increase of trace H with WD cooling age. We determine how often
remnant exo-Oort clouds, freshly excited from post-main-sequence stellar mass
loss, dynamically inject comets inside the WD's Roche radius. We improve upon
previous studies by considering a representative range of single WD masses
(0.52-1.00 Solar masses) and incorporating different cloud architectures, giant
branch stellar mass loss, stellar flybys, Galactic tides and a realistic escape
ellipsoid in self-consistent numerical simulations that integrate beyond 8 Gyr
ages of WD cooling. We find that about 10^{-5} of the material in an exo-Oort
cloud is typically amassed onto the WD, and that the H deposits accumulate even
as the cloud dissipates. This accumulation may account for the relatively large
amount of trace H, 10^{22}-10^{25} g, that is determined frequently among WDs
with cooling ages >= 1 Gyr. Our results also reaffirm the notion that exo-Oort
cloud comets are not the primary agents of the metal budgets observed in
polluted WD atmospheres.

range 2.2<z<6.8. These samples are based on Chandra and XMM-Newton data in

typical mass of logMh = 12.84+0.10/-0.11 and 11.73+0.39/-0.45 Msun/h,
respectively. This result requires a drop in the halo masses of Type 1 and 2
COSMOS AGN at z~3 compared to z<2 XMM COSMOS AGN with similar luminosities.
Additionally, we infer that unobscured COSMOS AGN at z~3 reside in 10 times
more massive halos compared to obscured COSMOS AGN, at 2.6sigma level. This
result extends to z~3 that found in COSMOS at z<2, and rules out the picture in
which obscuration is purely an orientation effect. A model which assumes that
the AGN activity is triggered by major mergers is quite successful in
predicting both the low halo mass of COSMOS AGN and the typical mass of
luminous SDSS quasars at z~3, with the latter inhabiting more massive halos
respect to moderate luminosity AGN. Alternatively we can argue, at least for
Type 1 COSMOS AGN, that they are possibly representative of an early phase of
fast (i.e. Eddington limited) BH growth induced by cosmic cold flows or disk
instabilities. Given the moderate luminosity, these new fast growing BHs have
masses of e7-8 Msun at z~3 which might evolve into e8.5-9 Msun mass BHs at z=0.
Following our clustering measurements, we argue that this fast BH growth at z~3
in AGN with moderate luminosity occurs in DMHs with typical mass of 6 times e12
Msun/h.

transfer using a properly chosen taper, single-mode fiber-waveguide coupling
efficiencies as high as 97(1)% are achieved. Efficient coupling is obtained for
a wide range of device geometries which are either singly-clamped on a chip or

companion papers of this series, we present the set of Generalized Linear
Models (GLMs) as a fast alternative method for tackling general astronomical
problems, including the ones related to the machine learning paradigm. To
demonstrate the applicability of GLMs to inherently positive and continuous
physical observables, we explore their use in estimating the photometric
redshifts of galaxies from their multi-wavelength photometry. Using the gamma
family with a log link function we predict redshifts from the PHoto-z Accuracy
Testing simulated catalogue and a subset of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey from
Data Release 10. We obtain fits that result in catastrophic outlier rates as
low as ~1% for simulated and ~2% for real data. Moreover, we can easily obtain
such levels of precision within a matter of seconds on a normal desktop
computer and with training sets that contain merely thousands of galaxies. Our
software is made publicly available as an user-friendly package developed in
Python, R and via an interactive web application
(https://cosmostatisticsinitiative.shinyapps.io/CosmoPhotoz). This software
allows users to apply a set of GLMs to their own photometric catalogues and
generates publication quality plots with minimum effort from the user. By
facilitating their ease of use to the astronomical community, this paper series
aims to make GLMs widely known and to encourage their implementation in future
large-scale projects, such as the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope.

many cool core clusters. Radio jets are suspected to dig large cavities into
the surrounding gas. In most cases, very large optical filaments are seen
around the central galaxy. The origin of these filaments is still not
understood. Star-forming regions are sometimes observed inside the filaments
and are interpreted as evidence of positive feedback. Cen A is a nearby galaxy
with huge optical filaments aligned with the AGN radio-jet direction. We
searched for line ratio variations along the filaments, kinematic evidence of
shock-broadend line widths, and large-scale dynamical structures. We observed a
1'x1' region around the inner filament of Cen A with MUSE on the VLT during
Science Verification. The brightest lines detected are the Halpha, [NII],
[OIII] and [SII]. MUSE shows that the filaments are made of clumpy structures
inside a more diffuse medium aligned with the radio-jet axis. We find evidence
of shocked shells surrounding the star-forming clumps from the line profiles,
suggesting that the star formation is induced by shocks. The clump line ratios
are best explained by a composite of shocks and star formation illuminated by a
radiation cone from the AGN. We also report a previously undetected large
arc-like structure: three streams running perpendicular to the main filament;
they are kinematically, morphologically, and excitationally distinct. The clear
difference in the excitation of the arcs and clumps suggests that the arcs are
very likely located outside of the radiation cone and match the position of the
filament only in projection. The three arcs are most consistent with neutral
material swept along by a backflow of the jet plasma from the AGN outburst that
is ionised through a diffuse radiation field with a low-ionisation parameter
that continues to excite gas away from the radiation cone.

are point-like sources detected with $\geq3\sigma$ confidence in at least one
of three energy bands (0.5-10, 0.5-2, and 2-10 keV), five have extended

sources have too few counts to permit individual classification, they are
divided into five spectral groups defined by their quantile properties. We
analyze stacked spectra of X-ray sources within each group, in conjunction with
their fluxes, variability, and infrared counterparts, to identify the dominant
populations in our survey. We find that $\sim$50% of our sources are foreground
sources located within 1-2 kpc, which is consistent with expectations from
previous surveys. Approximately 20% of sources are likely located in the
proximity of the Scutum-Crux and near Norma arm, while 30% are more distant, in
the proximity of the far Norma arm or beyond. We argue that a mixture of
magnetic and nonmagnetic CVs dominates the Scutum-Crux and near Norma arms,
while intermediate polars (IPs) and high-mass stars (isolated or in binaries)
dominate the far Norma arm. We also present the cumulative number count
distribution for sources in our survey that are detected in the hard energy

and active galactic nuclei dominate the hard X-ray emission down to
$f_X\approx10^{-14}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$, but the distribution curve
flattens at fainter fluxes. We find good agreement between the observed

Group. The Fornax field star population is dominated by intermediate age stars
but star formation was going on over almost its entire history. It has been
proposed that Fornax experienced a minor merger event. Despite recent progress,
only the high metallicity end of Fornax field stars ([Fe/H]>-1.2 dex) has been
sampled in larger number via high resolution spectroscopy. We want to better
understand the full chemical evolution of this galaxy by better sampling the
whole metallicity range, including more metal poor stars. We use the VLT-FLAMES
multi-fibre spectrograph in high-resolution mode to determine the abundances of
several alpha, iron-peak and neutron-capture elements in a sample of 47
individual Red Giant Branch stars in the Fornax dwarf spheroidal galaxy. We
combine these abundances with accurate age estimates derived from the age
probability distribution from the colour-magnitude diagram of Fornax. Similar
to other dwarf spheroidal galaxies, the old, metal-poor stars of Fornax are
typically alpha-rich while the young metal-rich stars are alpha-poor. In the
classical scenario of the time delay between SNe II and SNe Ia, we confirm that
SNe Ia started to contribute to the chemical enrichment at [Fe/H] between -2.0
and -1.8 dex. We find that the onset of SNe Ia took place between 12-10 Gyrs
ago. The high values of [Ba/Fe], [La/Fe] reflect the influence of SNe Ia and
AGB stars in the abundance pattern of the younger stellar population of Fornax.
Our findings of low [alpha/Fe] and enhanced [Eu/Mg] are compatible with an
initial mass function that lacks the most massive stars and with star formation
that kept going on throughout the whole history of Fornax. We find that massive
stars kept enriching the interstellar medium in alpha-elements, although they
were not the main contributor to the iron enrichment.

pits can form. For example, under certain circumstances rock surfaces that are
exposed to salts can form regular tessellating patterns of pits known as
""tafoni"". We introduce a simple lattice model in which a gas of corrosive
particles, described by a discrete convection diffusion equation, drifts onto a
surface. Each gas particle has a fixed probability of being absorbed and
causing damage at each contact. The surface is represented by a lattice of
strength numbers which reduce after each absorbtion event, with sites being
removed when their strength becomes negative. The model generates regular
formations of pits, with each pit having a characteristic trapezoidal geometry
determined by the particle bias, absorbtion probability and surface strength.
The formation of this geometry may be understood in terms of a first order
partial differential equation. By viewing pits as particle funnels, we are able
to relate the gradient of pit walls to absorbtion probability and particle
bias.

seen in the WMAP and Planck sky map differences, but are consistent within the
uncertainties and are not large enough to explain the widely-noted differences
in angular power spectra at higher l. After removing residual dipoles and
galactic foregrounds, the residual difference maps exhibit a quadrupole and
other large-scale systematic structure. We identify this structure as possibly
originating from Planck's beam sidelobe pick-up, but note that it appears to
have insignificant cosmological impact. We develop an extension of the internal
linear combination technique and find features that plausibly originate in the
Planck data. We examine LCDM model fits to the angular power spectra and
conclude that the ~2.5% difference in the spectra at multipoles greater than
l~100 are significant at the 3-5 sigma level. We revisit the analysis of WMAP's
beam data and conclude that previously-derived uncertainties are robust and
cannot explain the power spectrum differences. Finally, we examine the
consistency of the LCDM parameters inferred from each data set taking into
account the fact that both experiments observe the same sky, but cover
different multipole ranges, apply different sky masks, and have different
noise. While individual parameter values agree within the uncertainties, the 6
parameters taken together are discrepant at the ~6 sigma level, with chi2=56
for 6 dof (PTE = 3e-10). Of the 6 parameters, chi2 is best improved by
marginalizing over Omega_c h^2, giving chi2=5.2 for 5 degrees of freedom. We
find that perturbing the WMAP window function by its dominant beam error

The sensitivity of a PTA depends on the direction of the propagating

determine the optimal time allocation strategy among the MSPs in the North

spectrum of a black hole, proposed that the Immirizi parameter may be fixed by
letting the j=1 transitions of spin networks as the dominant processes
contributing to the black hole area, as opposed to the expected j=1/2
transitions. This suggested that the gauge group of the theory might be SO(3)
rather than SU(2). Corichi (2003), maintaining SU(2) as the underlying gauge
group, and invoking the principle of local fermion-number conservation,
reported the same value of the Immirizi parameter for j=1 processes as obtained
by Dreyer. In this note, preserving the SU(2) structure of the theory, and
considering j=1 transitions as the dominant processes, we point out that the
value of the Immirizi parameter is in fact twice the value reported by these

of the closest and best studied super-luminous explosions that has a broad and
slowly fading lightcurve similar to SN 2007bi. Here we present new photometry
and spectroscopy for PTF12dam from 200-500 days (rest-frame) after peak and a
detailed analysis of the host galaxy (SDSS J142446.21+461348.6 at z = 0.107).
Using deep templates and image subtraction we show that the full lightcurve can
be fit with a magnetar model if escape of high-energy gamma rays is taken into
account. The full bolometric lightcurve from -53 to +399 days (with respect to
peak) cannot be fit satisfactorily with the pair-instability models. An
alternative model of interaction with a dense CSM produces a good fit to the
data although this requires a very large mass (~ 13 M_sun) of hydrogen free
CSM. The host galaxy is a compact dwarf (physical size ~ 1.9 kpc) and with M_g
= -19.33 +/- 0.10, it is the brightest nearby SLSN Ic host discovered so far.
The host is a low mass system (2.8 x 10^8 M_sun) with a star-formation rate
(5.0 M_sun/year), which implies a very high specific star-formation rate (17.9
Gyr^-1). The remarkably strong nebular lines provide detections of the [O III]

oxygen abundance of 12 + log(O/H) = 8.05 +/- 0.09. We show here that they are

is to show violation of a Bell inequality by measuring a continuously emitted
stream of entangled photon pairs. The measurements involve the detection of
photons by two spatially separated parties. The detection times are recorded
and compared to quantify the violation. The violation critically depends on
determining which detections are coincident. Because the recorded detection
times have ""jitter"", coincidences cannot be inferred perfectly. In the presence
of settings-dependent timing errors, this can allow a local-realistic system to
show apparent violation--the so-called ""coincidence loophole"". Here we
introduce a family of Bell inequalities based on signed, directed distances
between the parties' sequences of recorded timetags. Given that the timetags
are recorded for synchronized, fixed observation periods and that the settings
choices are random and independent of the source, violation of these
inequalities unambiguously shows non-classical correlations violating local
realism. Distance-based Bell inequalities are generally useful for two-party
configurations where the effective size of the measurement outcome space is
large or infinite. We show how to systematically modify the underlying Bell
functions to improve the signal to noise ratio and to quantify the significance

We employ Granger Causality (GC) with significance testing to conduct this

distinct statistical attributes when compared to other YouTube content that has

demonstrated to be attributed to the thermally driven phase separation. In this
work, the structure evolution of GO with mild annealing is closely
investigated. It reveals that in addition to phase separation, the
transformation of oxygen functionalities also occurs, which leads to the slight
reduction of GO membranes and furthers the enhancement of GO properties. These
results are further supported by the density functional theory based
calculations. The results also show that the amount of chemically bonded oxygen
atoms on graphene decreases gradually and we propose that the strongly
physisorbed oxygen species constrained in the holes and vacancies on GO lattice
might be responsible for the preserved oxygen content during the mild annealing
procedure. The present experimental results and calculations indicate that both
the diffusion and transformation of oxygen functional groups might play
important roles in the scalable enhancement of GO properties.

inducing spacetime torsion, though, remarkably, it does not alter the black

memory proposed by Gripon and Berrou. This associative memory resembles the
celebrated Willshaw model with an added partite cluster structure. In the
literature, two retrieving schemes have been proposed for the network dynamics,
namely sum-of-sum and sum-of-max. They both offer considerably better
performance than Willshaw and Hopfield networks, when comparable retrieval
scenarios are considered. Former discussions and experiments concentrate on the
erasure scenario, where a partial message is used as a probe to the network, in
the hope of retrieving the full message. In this regard, sum-of-max outperforms
sum-of-sum in terms of retrieval rate by a large margin. However, we observe
that when noise and errors are present and the network is queried by a corrupt
probe, sum-of-max faces a severe limitation as its stringent activation rule
prevents a neuron from reviving back into play once deactivated. In this
manuscript, we categorize and analyze different error scenarios so that both
the erasure and the corrupt scenarios can be treated consistently. We make an
amendment to the network structure to improve the retrieval rate, at the cost
of an extra scalar per neuron. Afterwards, five different approaches are
proposed to deal with corrupt probes. As a result, we extend the network
capability, and also increase the robustness of the retrieving procedure. We
then experimentally compare all these proposals and discuss pros and cons of
each approach under different types of errors. Simulation results show that if
carefully designed, the network is able to preserve both a high retrieval rate
and a low running time simultaneously, even when queried by a corrupt probe.

progenitors of type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia). In this article, we systematically
studied the hybrid CONe WD + He star scenario for the progenitors of SNe Ia, in
which a hybrid CONe WD increases its mass to the Chandrasekhar mass limit by
accreting He-rich material from a non-degenerate He star. According to a series
of detailed binary population synthesis simulations, we obtained the SN Ia
birthrates and delay times for this scenario. The SN Ia birthrates for this
scenario are ~0.033-0.539*10^(-3)yr^(-1), which roughly accounts for 1-18% of
all SNe Ia. The estimated delay times are ~28Myr-178Myr, which are the youngest
SNe Ia predicted by any progenitor model so far. We suggest that SNe Ia from
this scenario may provide an alternative explanation of type Iax SNe. We also
presented some properties of the donors at the point when the WDs reach the
Chandrasekhar mass. These properties may be a good starting point for
investigating the surviving companions of SNe Ia, and for constraining the
progenitor scenario studied in this work.

  Software diversification is a probabilistic technique that uses code and data

large amounts of functionally equivalent but different binaries. Malware
diversity builds on software diversity and ensures that any two diversified

calculate the Lyapunov exponent for the orbit for variations in initial
conditions at the level of the present day uncertainties in our knowledge of
its orbital parameters. On the basis of our calculations of the Lyapunov
exponent for comet Halley, the chaotic nature of its motion is demonstrated.
The e-folding timescale for the divergence of initially very similar orbits is
approximately 70 years. The sensitivity of the dynamics on initial conditions
is also evident in the self-similarity character of the survival time and
frequency analysis maps in the vicinity of Halley's orbit, which indicates
that, on average, it is unstable on a timescale of hundreds of thousands of
years. The chaotic nature of Halley's present day orbit implies that a precise
determination of its motion, at the level of the present day observational
uncertainty, is difficult to predict on a timescale of approximately 100 years.
Furthermore, we also find that the ejection of Halley from the solar system or
its collision with another body could occur on a timescale as short as 10,000

ratio q = 0.106 and fill-out factor f = 72%. These parameters indicate that the
system is a low mass ratio overcontact binary with a high degree of geometrical
contact. The H alpha line equivalent width varied at different phases and it is
found that the line is possibly filled-in at secondary minima. From a small
sample of overcontact binaries, we found a correlation between the orbital
period and H alpha line equivalent width of the primary component. Based on a
sample of high filling factor and low mass ratio contact binaries, a mass ratio
cut-off is observed at q = 0.085 in mass ratio - period plane. It was observed
that below q $\le$ 0.085, period decreases with an increase in q and above it,
period increases as the mass ratio increases. Interestingly, the observed mass
ratio cut-off value lies close to the critical mass ratio range as predicted in

responses. The later an escape mutation emerges, the slower it outgrows its
competition, i. e. the escape rate is lower. This pattern could indicate that
the strength of the CD8+ cell responses is waning, or that later viral escape
mutants carry a larger fitness cost. In this paper, we investigate whether the
pattern of decreasing escape rate could also be caused by genetic interference
among different escape strains. To this end, we developed a mathematical
multi-epitope model of HIV dynamics, which incorporates stochastic effects,
recombination and mutation. We used cumulative linkage disequilibrium measures
to quantify the amount of interference. We found that nearly synchronous,
similarly strong immune responses in two-locus systems enhance the generation
of genetic interference. This effect, combined with densely spaced sampling
times at the beginning of infection, leads to decreasing successive escape rate
estimates, even when there were no selection differences among alleles. These
predictions are supported by experimental data from one HIV-infected patient.
Thus, interference could explain why later escapes are slower. Considering
escape mutations in isolation, neglecting their genetic linkage, conceals the
underlying haplotype dynamics and can affect the estimation of the selective
pressure exerted by CD8+ cells. In systems in which multiple escape mutations
appear, the occurrence of interference dynamics should be assessed by measuring
the linkage between different escape mutations.

single-output (MISO) wireless energy transfer (WET) system in
frequency-selective channels, where the frequency-diversity and
energy-beamforming gains can be both achieved by properly learning the channel
state information (CSI) at the energy transmitter (ET). By exploiting channel
reciprocity, a two-phase channel training scheme is proposed to achieve the
diversity and beamforming gains, respectively. In the first phase, pilot
signals are sent from the energy receiver (ER) over a selected subset of the
available frequency sub-bands, through which the sub-band that exhibits the
largest sum-power over all the antennas at the ET is determined and its index
is sent back to the ER. In the second phase, the selected sub-band is further
trained for the ET to estimate the multi-antenna channel and implement energy
beamforming. We propose to maximize the net energy harvested at the ER, which
is the total harvested energy offset by that used for the two-phase channel
training. The optimal training design, including the number of sub-bands
trained and the energy allocated for each of the two phases, is derived.

regularizing the classifier learning to maximize mutual information between the
classification response and the true class label. We argue that, with the
learned classifier, the uncertainty of the true class label of a data sample
should be reduced by knowing its classification response as much as possible.
The reduced uncertainty is measured by the mutual information between the
classification response and the true class label. To this end, when learning a
linear classifier, we propose to maximize the mutual information between
classification responses and true class labels of training samples, besides
minimizing the classification error and reduc- ing the classifier complexity.
An objective function is constructed by modeling mutual information with
entropy estimation, and it is optimized by a gradi- ent descend method in an
iterative algorithm. Experiments on two real world pattern classification
problems show the significant improvements achieved by maximum mutual
information regularization.

profile (VP), used almost universally by databases and radiative-transfer
codes, to represent pressure effects and Doppler broadening in isolated
vibrational-rotational and pure rotational transitions of the water molecule
have resulted in the development of a variety of alternative line-profile
models. These models capture more of the physics of the influence of pressure
on line shapes but, in general, at the price of greater complexity. The Task
Group recommends that the partially Correlated quadratic-Speed-Dependent
Hard-Collision profile should be adopted as the appropriate model for
high-resolution spectroscopy. For simplicity this should be called the
Hartmann--Tran profile (HTP). The HTP is sophisticated enough to capture the
various collisional contributions to the isolated line shape, can be computed
in a straightforward and rapid manner, and reduces to simpler profiles,
including the Voigt profile, under certain simplifying assumptions.

synchrotron radiation, the most dominant foreground component after point
source removal. Our theoretical analysis is validated using simulations at 150
MHz, mainly for GMRT and also briefly for LOFAR. The Bare Estimator uses
pairwise correlations of the measured visibilities, while the Tapered Gridded
Estimator uses the visibilities after gridding in the uv plane. The former is
very precise, but computationally expensive for large data. The latter has a
lower precision, but takes less computation time which is proportional to the
data volume. The latter also allows tapering of the sky response leading to
sidelobe suppression, an useful ingredient for foreground removal. Both
estimators avoid the positive bias that arises due to the system noise. We
consider amplitude and phase errors of the gain, and the w-term as possible
sources of errors . We find that the estimated angular power spectrum is
exponentially sensitive to the variance of the phase errors but insensitive to
amplitude errors. The statistical uncertainties of the estimators are affected
by both amplitude and phase errors. The w-term does not have a significant
effect at the angular scales of our interest. We propose the Tapered Gridded

the K$_{1-x}$Na$_{x}$Fe$_2$As$_2$ at pressures below 1.5 GPa showed, that the
reduction of $T_c$ with Na substitution follows the Abrikosov-Gor'kov law with
the critical temperature $T_{c0}$ of the clean system (without pair-breaking)

$T_c$ of K$_{1-x}$Na$_x$Fe$_2$As$_2$ is nearly independent of the lattice

convergence rate of the turnpike property can be estimated. We give positive
answers to both questions. To achieve these results, we first show that there
is a classical solution to the HJB equation and give a representation of the

nontrivial examples that would be difficult to solve with the trial and error

distribution of normalized normal forces exhibits a gradual broadening with
increasing the pure shear deformation, leading to a slower decay for large
forces. The process however slows down and the distribution approaches an
invariant shape at high shear deformations. By introducing the joint
probability distribution in sheared configurations, it is shown that for a
fixed direction, the force distribution decays faster than exponentially even
in a sheared system. The overall broadening can be attributed to the averaging
over different directions in the presence of shear-induced stress anisotropy.
The distribution of normalized tangential forces almost preserves its shape for
arbitrary applied strain.

can be achieved by adaptive sensing using convex criteria. We generalize
previous work on adaptive sensing to (a) include multiple classes of targets
with different levels of importance and (b) accommodate multiple sensor models.
New optimization policies are developed to allocate a limited resource budget
to simultaneously locate, classify and estimate a sparse number of targets
embedded in a large space. Upper and lower bounds on the performance of the
proposed policies are derived by analyzing a baseline policy, which allocates
resources uniformly across the scene, and an oracle policy which has a priori
knowledge of the target locations/classes. These bounds quantify analytically
the potential benefit of adaptive sensing as a function of target frequency and
importance. Numerical results indicate that the proposed policies perform close
to the oracle bound (<3dB) when signal quality is sufficiently high
(e.g.~performance within 3 dB for SNR above 15 dB). Moreover, the proposed
policies improve on previous policies in terms of reducing estimation error,
reducing misclassification probability, and increasing expected return. To
account for sensors with different levels of agility, three sensor models are
considered: global adaptive (GA), which can allocate different amounts of
resource to each location in the space; global uniform (GU), which can allocate
resources uniformly across the scene; and local adaptive (LA), which can
allocate fixed units to a subset of locations. Policies that use a mixture of
GU and LA sensors are shown to perform similarly to those that use GA sensors
while being more easily implementable.

thermal components of the radio emission are investigated in images from 94 to
672 GHz ($\lambda$ 3.2 mm to 450 $\mu$m), with the assistance of a
high-resolution 44 GHz synchrotron template from the ATCA, and a dust template
from ALMA observations at 672 GHz. An analysis of the emission distribution
over the equatorial ring in images from 44 to 345 GHz highlights a gradual
decrease of the east-to-west asymmetry ratio with frequency. We attribute this
to the shorter synchrotron lifetime at high frequencies. Across the transition
from radio to far infrared, both the synchrotron/dust-subtracted images and the
spectral energy distribution (SED) suggest additional emission beside the main
synchrotron component ($S_{\nu}\propto\nu^{-0.73}$) and the thermal component
originating from dust grains at $T\sim22$ K. This excess could be due to
free-free flux or emission from grains of colder dust. However, a second
flat-spectrum synchrotron component appears to better fit the SED, implying
that the emission could be attributed to a pulsar wind nebula (PWN). The
residual emission is mainly localised west of the SN site, as the spectral
analysis yields $-0.4\lesssim\alpha\lesssim-0.1$ across the western regions,
with $\alpha\sim0$ around the central region. If there is a PWN in the remnant
interior, these data suggest that the pulsar may be offset westward from the SN
position.

the effect of confinement on a $2d$ crystal of point particles interacting with

This system can describe colloidal particles at the air-water interface. It is
shown that the system characteristics depend sensitively on the boundary
conditions at the two {\it walls} providing the confinement. The walls exert
perpendicular forces on their adjacent particles. The potential between walls
and particles varies as the inverse power of ten. Structural quantities such as
density profile, structure factor and orientational order parameter are

  Recognition","Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers, IEEE, 2015,
  (to Appear)",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Biometric-based identification has drawn a lot of attention in the recent
years. Among all biometrics, palmprint is known to possess a rich set of
features. In this paper we have proposed to use DCT-based features in parallel
with wavelet-based ones for palmprint identification. PCA is applied to the
features to reduce their dimensionality and the majority voting algorithm is
used to perform classification. The features introduced here result in a
near-perfectly accurate identification. This method is tested on a well-known
multispectral palmprint database and an accuracy rate of 99.97-100\% is
achieved, outperforming all previous methods in similar conditions.

substantially from their bulk density. Using a mean-field approach to describe
the energetic landscape near the carbon nanotube (CNT) wall, we obtain
analytical results describing the lengthscales associated with the layering
observed at the fluid-CNT interface. When combined with molecular simulation
results for the fluid density in the layered region, this approach allows us to
derive a closed-form prediction for the overall equilibrium fluid density as a
function of the CNT radius that is in excellent agreement with molecular
dynamics simulations. We also show how aspects of this theory can be extended
to describe water confined within CNTs and find good agreement with results
from the literature.

on a triangular lattice are studied. For the undoped system, a combination of
the numerical exact diagonalization calculation and the four-sublattice
transformation analysis suggests one possible exotic phase and four
magnetically ordered phases including a collinear stripe pattern and a
noncollinear spiral pattern in the global phase diagram. The exotic phase near
the antiferromagnetic (AF) Kitaev point is further investigated by using the
Schwinger-fermion mean-field method, and we obtain an energetically favorable
$Z_2$ chiral spin liquid with a Chern number $\pm2$ as a promising candidate.
At finite doping, we find that the AF Heisenberg coupling supports an $s$-wave
or a $d_{x^2-y^2}+id_{xy}$-wave superconductivity (SC), while the AF and the
ferromagnetic Kitaev interactions favor a $d_{x^2-y^2}+id_{xy}$-wave SC and a
time-reversal invariant topological $p$-wave SC, respectively. Possible
experimental realizations and related candidate materials are also discussed.

Among the most prominent phenomena in quantum coherent control are Rabi
oscillations, Ramsey fringes and Hahn echoes. We demonstrate that these
phenomena can be derived classically by use of a simple coupled harmonic
oscillator model. The classical problem can be cast in a form that is formally
equivalent to the quantum mechanical Bloch equations with the exception that
the longitudinal and the transverse relaxation times ($T_1$ and $T_2$) are
equal. The classical analysis is intuitive and well suited for familiarizing
students with the basic concepts of quantum coherent control, while at the same
time highlighting the fundamental differences between classical and quantum
theories.
