Patriarca [Eur. Phys. J. B 87: 170 (2014)], who showed by simulations that the
wealth distribution in this model converges to a Gamma distribution with shape
parameter $2$. Here we justify this conclusion analytically, in the
infinite-population limit. An infinite-population version of the model is
derived, describing the evolution of the wealth distribution in terms of
iterations of a nonlinear operator on the space of probability densities. It is
proved that the Gamma distributions with shape parameter $2$ are fixed points
of this operator, and that, starting with an arbitrary wealth distribution, the
process converges to one of these fixed points. We also discuss the mixed model
introduced in the same paper, in which exchanges are either bidirectional or
unidirectional with fixed probability. We prove that, although, as found by
Heinsalu and Patriarca, the equilibrium distribution can be closely fit by
Gamma distributions, the equilibrium distribution for this model is {\it{not}}
a Gamma distribution.

in the topic of economic networks. One of the main channels of shock
propagation among countries is the International Trade Network (ITN). Two
important models for the ITN structure, the classical gravity model of trade
(more popular among economists) and the fitness model (more popular among
networks scientists), are both limited to the characterization of only one
representation of the ITN. The gravity model satisfactorily predicts the volume
of trade between connected countries, but cannot reproduce the observed missing
links (i.e. the topology). On the other hand, the fitness model can
successfully replicate the topology of the ITN, but cannot predict the volumes.
This paper tries to make an important step forward in the unification of those
two frameworks, by proposing a new GDP-driven model which can simultaneously
reproduce the binary and the weighted properties of the ITN. Specifically, we
adopt a maximum-entropy approach where both the degree and the strength of each
node is preserved. We then identify strong nonlinear relationships between the
GDP and the parameters of the model. This ultimately results in a weighted
generalization of the fitness model of trade, where the GDP plays the role of a
`macroeconomic fitness' shaping the binary and the weighted structure of the
ITN simultaneously. Our model mathematically highlights an important asymmetry
in the role of binary and weighted network properties, namely the fact that
binary properties can be inferred without the knowledge of weighted ones, while
the opposite is not true.

by our poor understanding of their internal structures, and this, in turn,
clouds our understanding of the formation and evolution of these bodies.
Observations of the rotational states of asteroids whose diameters are larger
than a few hundreds of meters have revealed that they are dominated by gravity
and that most are unlikely to be monoliths; however, there is a wide range of
plausible internal structures. Numerical and analytical studies of shape and
spin limits of gravitational aggregates and their collisional evolution show a
strong dependence on shear strength. In order to study this effect, we carry
out a systematic exploration of the dependence of collision outcomes on
dissipation and friction parameters of the material components making up the
bodies. We simulate the catastrophic disruption (leading to the largest remnant
retaining 50% of the original mass) of km-size asteroids modeled as
gravitational aggregates using pkdgrav, a cosmology N-body code adapted to
collisional problems and recently enhanced with a new soft-sphere collision
algorithm that includes more realistic contact forces. We find that for a range
of three different materials, higher friction and dissipation values increase
the catastrophic disruption threshold by about half a magnitude. Furthermore,
we find that pre-impact rotation systematically increases mass loss on average,
regardless of the target's internal configuration. Our results have important
implications for the efficiency of planet formation via planetesimal growth,
and also more generally to estimate the impact energy threshold for
catastrophic disruption, as this generally has only been evaluated for
non-spinning bodies without detailed consideration of material properties.

Quantitative spectroscopic analysis of these modern datasets is enabling us to
review the physical properties of blue massive stars with robust samples, not
only revisiting mean properties and general trends, but also incorporating
information about the effects of second-order parameters.
  We investigate the spectral type -- effective temperature (SpT - Teff)
calibration for O-type dwarfs, and its claimed dependence on metallicity, using
statistically-meaningful samples of stars extracted from the IACOB and VFTS
surveys.
  We perform a homogeneous differential spectroscopic analysis of 33 Galactic
and 53 LMC O~dwarfs (spanning spectral types of O4 -- O9.7) using the
IACOB-GBAT package, a $\chi^2$-fitting algorithm based on a large pre-computed
grid of FASTWIND models, and standard techniques for the hydrogen/helium
analysis of O-type stars. We compare the estimated effective temperatures and
gravities as a function of (internally consistent) spectral classifications.
  While the general trend is that the temperature of a star increases with
earlier spectral types and decreasing metallicity, we show that the large range
of gravities found for O-type dwarfs -- spaning up to 0.45-0.50 dex in some
spectral bins -- plays a critical role on the dependence of the effective
temperature calibrations as a function of spectral type and metallicity.
  This result warns us about the use of SpT - Teff calibrations for O-dwarfs
which ignore the effects of gravity, and highlights the risks of employing
calibrations based on small samples. The effects of this scatter in gravities
(evolutionary status) for O-type dwarfs should be included in future recipes
which employ SpT - Teff calibrations.

thermally distributed modes with temperatures $T_{\rm L}$ and $T_{\rm R}$ for

long-time energy transfer can be described by a continuum of independent
Poisson processes, for which we provide the exact weights. We further describe
the full time evolution of local observables following the quench. Averages of
generic local observables, including the stress-energy tensor, approach the
steady state with a power-law in time, where the exponent depends on the
initial conditions at the connection hypersurface. We describe boundary

X-ray outburst in 2011 and initially classified as an accreting X-ray binary in
the globular cluster NGC 6388. A reanalysis of the outburst data collected with
INTEGRAL and Swift suggested that the enhanced X-ray emission from IGR
J17361-4441 could have been due to a rare tidal disruption event of a
terrestrial- icy planet by a white dwarf. In this letter we report on the
analysis of XMM-Newton data collected in 2011 during the outburst from IGR
J17361-4441. Our analysis revealed the presence of a $\sim$100 mHz
quasi-periodic oscillation in the X-ray emission from the source and confirmed
the presence of a soft thermal component (kT$\sim$0.08 keV) in its spectrum. We
discuss these findings in the context of the different possibilities proposed
to explain the nature of IGR J17361-4441.

well-known different approaches to the description of non-equilibrium dynamics
into a unified formulation, which extends to such frameworks the concept of
Steepest Entropy Ascent (SEA) dynamics introduced by the present author in
previous works on quantum thermodynamics. The present formulation constitutes a
generalization also for the quantum thermodynamics framework. In the SEA
modeling principle a key role is played by the geometrical metric with respect
to which to measure the length of a trajectory in state space. In the near
equilibrium limit, the metric tensor is related to the Onsager's generalized
resistivity tensor. Therefore, through the identification of a suitable metric
field which generalizes the Onsager generalized resistance to the arbitrarily
far non-equilibrium domain, most of the existing theories of non-equilibrium
thermodynamics can be cast in such a way that the state exhibits a spontaneous
tendency to evolve in state space along the path of SEA compatible with the
conservation constraints and the boundary conditions. The resulting unified
family of SEA dynamical models is intrinsically and strongly consistent with
the second law of thermodynamics. Non-negativity of the entropy production is a
readily proved general feature of SEA dynamics. In several of the different
approaches to non-equilibrium description we consider here, the SEA concept has
not been investigated before. We believe it defines the precise meaning and the
domain of general validity of the so-called Maximum Entropy Production
Principle. It is hoped that the present unifying approach may prove useful in
providing a fresh basis for effective, thermodynamically consistent, numerical
models and theoretical treatments of irreversible conservative relaxation
towards equilibrium from far non-equilibrium states.

  Cobi introduced an alternative approach to conference scheduling by engaging
the community to play an active role in the planning process. The current Cobi
pipeline consists of committee-sourcing and author-sourcing to plan a
conference schedule. We further explore the design space of community-sourcing
by introducing attendee-sourcing -- a process that collects input from
conference attendees and encodes them as preferences and constraints for
creating sessions and schedule. For CHI 2014, a large multi-track conference in
human-computer interaction with more than 3,000 attendees and 1,000 authors, we
collected attendees' preferences by making available all the accepted papers at
the conference on a paper recommendation tool we built called Confer, for a
period of 45 days before announcing the conference program (sessions and
schedule). We compare the preferences marked on Confer with the preferences
collected from Cobi's author-sourcing approach. We show that attendee-sourcing
can provide insights beyond what can be discovered by author-sourcing. For CHI
2014, the results show value in the method and attendees' participation. It
produces data that provides more alternatives in scheduling and complements
data collected from other methods for creating coherent sessions and reducing

minor (f$\lesssim$10% of stellar mass) burst of recent (t$\lesssim$1 Gyr)

populations do not strongly trend with measurements of galaxy morphology. We
note that massive (log(M[$M_{\odot}$])>10.5) recently star-forming ETGs appear

conclude that both mechanisms of the quenching of star-formation in disk-like
ETGs and (gas-rich, minor) merger activity contribute to the formation of young
stars and the size-mass evolution of intermediate redshift ETGs. The number of
ETGs for which we have both HST WFC3 panchromatic (especially UV) imaging and

conclusion on the relative roles of both of these mechanisms remains an open

experimental investigations of its electronic structure. The onset of
absorption in optical conductivity measurements has generally been interpreted
to be due to interband transitions at the fundamental gap. Here we re-examine
the electronic structure of YTiO3 using density functional theory with either a
Hubbard correction (DFT+U) or a hybrid functional. Interband transitions turn
out to be much higher in energy than the observed onset of optical absorption.
However, in case of $p$-type doping, holes tend to become self-trapped in the
form of small polarons, localized on individual Ti sites. Exciting electrons
from the occupied lower Hubbard band to the small-polaron state then leads to
broad infrared absorption, consistent with the onset in the experimental
optical conductivity spectra.

Directed (co)homology theories for such sheaves describes familar constructs on
networks. First homology classifies locally decomposable flows, an orientation
sheaf over a semiring generalizes directions, connecting maps for homology
assign values to flows, connecting maps for cohomology assign values to cuts,
and a Poincare Duality describes a decomposition of flows as local flows over
cuts. A consequent interpretation of feasible flow-values as a homotopy limit
generalizes MFMC for edge weights in certain ordered monoids [Frieze] and hence
also classical MFMC. Certain duality gaps are explained as a failure for
directed sheaf (co)homology to satisfy a natural generalization of exactness.

evolution of many hierarchical triple systems. The standard LK mechanism
consists of large-amplitude oscillations in eccentricity and inclination of a
binary subject to the quadrupole potential from an outer perturber. Recent work
has shown that when the octupole terms are included in the potential, the inner
binary can reach more extreme eccentricities as well as undergo orientation
flips. It is known that pericenter precessions due to short-range effects, such
as General Relativity and tidal and rotational distortions, can limit the
growth of eccentricity and even suppress standard (quadrupolar) LK
oscillations, but their effect on the octupole-level LK mechanism has not been
fully explored. In this paper, we systematically study how these short-range
forces affect the extreme orbital behaviour found in octupole LK cycles. In
general, the influence of the octupole potential is confined to a range of
initial mutual inclinations Itot centered around 90deg (when the inner binary
mass ratio is <<1), with this range expanding with increasing octupole
strength. We find that, while the short-range forces do not change the width
and location of this ""window of influence"", they impose a strict upper limit on
the maximum achievable eccentricity. This limiting eccentricity can be
calculated analytically, and its value holds even for strong octupole potential
and for the general case of three comparable masses. Short-range forces also
affect orbital flips, progressively reducing the range of Itot within which
flips are possible as the intensity of these forces increases.

the primordial (linear) differences in terms of matter power spectrum. We find
that early epochs can be exceptional probes of the dark-matter nature.
Non-linear WDM power spectra and mass functions are up to 2 dex lower than in
CDM and show spreads of factor of a few persisting in the whole first Gyr.
Runaway molecular cooling in WDM haloes results severely inhibited because of
the damping of power at large $k$ modes and hence cosmic (population III and
II-I) star formation rate (SFR) is usually suppressed with respect to CDM
predictions. Luminous objects formed in a WDM background are very rare at
$z>10$, due to the sparser and retarded evolution of early WDM mini-haloes
during the dark ages and their lack can be fitted with a simple analytical
formula depending only on magnitude and redshift. Future high-$z$ observations
of faint galaxies have the potential to discriminate between CDM and WDM
scenarios by means of cosmic stellar mass density (SMD) and specific SFR, as
well. When compared to the effects of alternative cosmologies (e.g.
non-Gaussian or dark-energy models) or of high-order corrections at large $z$

the outskirts of the Galactic halo. Our results can explain the prevalence of
cool gas in galactic winds and galactic halos and how such cool gas survives in

dispersion following $m_\bullet\propto\sigma^{F/2}$ (for global mean density

subtle asymmetries. A negative excess in the intensity fluctuations indicates
that more pixels have fainter-than-average intensities compared with those that

how the negative excess can be explained by a series of impulsive events,
coupled with exponential decays, that are fractionally below the current
resolving limits of low-noise equipment on high-resolution ground-based

that the intensity asymmetries cannot be explained by photon-counting

with an impulsive event occurring every ~360s in a 10,000 km^2 area of the

inner truncations in at least one of their disks. These truncations lead to
Freeman Type II profiles when projected face-on. Slow-rotating galaxies are
less complex, lacking inner disk truncations and requiring fewer disk
components to reproduce their light distributions. Super-thin disk components

observed in the interstellar medium (ISM) is a debated topic. The Planck
all-sky maps of linearly polarized emission from dust at 353GHz provide the
required combination of imaging and statistics to study the correlation between
the structures of the Galactic magnetic field and of interstellar matter, both
in the diffuse ISM and in molecular clouds. The data reveal structures, or
ridges, in the intensity map with counterparts in the Stokes Q and/or U maps.
We focus on structures at intermediate and high Galactic latitudes with column
density from $10^{20}$ to $10^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$. We measure the magnetic field
orientation on the plane of the sky from the polarization data, and present an
algorithm to estimate the orientation of the ridges from the dust intensity
map. We use analytical models to account for projection effects. Comparing
polarization angles on and off the structures, we estimate the mean ratio
between the strengths of the turbulent and mean components of the magnetic
field to be between 0.6 and 1.0, with a preferred value of 0.8. We find that
the ridges are preferentially aligned with the magnetic field measured on the
structures. This trend becomes more striking for increasing polarization
fraction and decreasing column density. We interpret the increase of alignment
with polarization fraction as a consequence of projections effects. The
decrease of alignment for high column density is not due to a loss of
correlation between the structures and the geometry of the magnetic field. In
molecular complexes, we observe structures perpendicular to the magnetic field,
which cannot be accounted for by projection effects. We discuss our results in
the context of models and MHD simulations, which describe the formation of
structures in the magnetized ISM.

from thermal equilibrium in the early universe. In a large class of
baryogenesis models, the baryon asymmetry results from the out-of-equilibrium
decay of a new, massive particle. We highlight that in the interesting scenario
where this particle has a weak scale mass, this out-of-equilibrium condition
requires a proper decay length larger than O(1) mm. Such new fields are within
reach of the LHC, at which they can be pair produced leaving a distinctive,
displaced-vertex signature. This scenario is realized in the recently proposed
mechanism of baryogenesis where the baryon asymmetry is produced through the
freeze-out and subsequent decay of a meta-stable weakly interacting massive
particle (""WIMP baryogenesis""). In analogy to missing energy searches for WIMP
dark matter, the LHC is an excellent probe of these new long-lived particles
responsible for baryogenesis via the low-background displaced vertex channel.
In our paper, we estimate the limits on simplified models inspired by WIMP
baryogenesis from two of the most sensitive collider searches by CMS and ATLAS
with 8 TeV LHC data. We also estimate the LHC reach at 13 TeV using current
strategies, and demonstrate that O(10) improvements in cross-section limits can
be achieved by requiring two displaced vertices while lowering kinematic
thresholds. For meta-stable WIMPs produced through electroweak interactions,
the high luminosity LHC is sensitive to masses up to 2.5 TeV for lifetimes
around 1 cm, while for singlets pair-produced through the off-shell-Higgs
portal, the LHC is sensitive to production cross sections of O(50) ab for
benchmark masses around 150 GeV. Our analysis and proposals also generally
apply to displaced vertex signatures from other new physics such as hidden
valley models, twin Higgs models and displaced supersymmetry.

bypass this difficulty and establish that randomly pinning the position of a

ultrastable configurations at essentially no numerical cost, while avoiding
undesired structural changes due to the preparation protocol. Building on the
analogy with vapor-deposited ultrastable glasses, we study the melting kinetics
of these configurations following a sudden temperature jump into the liquid
phase. In homogeneous geometries, we find that enhanced kinetic stability is
accompanied by large scale dynamic heterogeneity, while a competition between
homogeneous and heterogeneous melting is observed when a liquid boundary
invades the glass at constant velocity. Our work demonstrates the feasibility
of large-scale, atomistically resolved, and experimentally relevant simulations
of the kinetics of ultrastable glasses.

system, which is obtained by adding a new subsystem one after the other, until
all $n$ subsystems, where $n \ge 2$, are included in the distributed control
system. It is assumed that a small random perturbation enters only into the
first subsystem and is then subsequently transmitted to the other subsystems.
Moreover, for any $\ell \in \{2, ..., n\}$, the distributed control system,
compatible with the expanding construction, which is obtained from the first
$\ell$ subsystems, satisfies an appropriate H\""{o}rmander condition. As a
result of this, the diffusion process is degenerate, i.e., the backward
operator associated with it is a degenerate parabolic equation. Our main
interest here is to prevent the diffusion process (that corresponds to a
particular subsystem) from leaving a given bounded open domain. In particular,
we consider a risk-sensitive version of the mean escape time criterion with
respect to each of the subsystems. Using a variational representation, we
characterize the risk-sensitive escape control for the diffusion process as the
lower and upper values of an associated stochastic differential game. Finally,
we comment on the implication of our results, where one is also interested in
evaluating the performance of the risk-sensitive escape control, when there is
some modeling error in the distributed control system.

insulating ground state of a finite-size molecule that cannot be adiabatically
connected to a single Slater determinant, i.e., to a band insulator, provided
that time-reversal and lattice translation symmetries are preserved. Based on
exact numerical diagonalization for finite Hubbard interaction strength $U$ and
existing Bethe-ansatz studies of the one-dimensional Hubbard model in the
large-$U$ limit, we establish a duality between Hubbard molecules with $4n$ and
$4n+2$ sites, with $n$ integer. A molecule with $4n$ sites is an FMI in the
absence of flux but becomes a band insulator in the presence of a half-quantum
of flux, while a molecule with $4n+2$ sites is a band insulator in the absence
of flux but becomes an FMI in the presence of a half-quantum of flux. Including
next-nearest-neighbor-hoppings gives rise to new FMI states that belong to
multidimensional irreducible representations of the molecular point group,

reducing a priori unknown discovery and follow-up survey properties to nuisance
parameters and using a likelihood-free Bayesian rejection sampler for parameter
estimation. Using this survey-agnostic approach, I confirm that the Neptune
Trojans are a dynamically excited population: at $>$95% confidence, the Neptune
Trojans' inclination width must be $\sigma_i > 11^\circ$. For comparison and
motivation purposes, I also model the Jupiter Trojan orbit distributions in the
same basis and produce new estimates of their parameters (Jupiter Trojan
$\sigma_i=14.4^\circ \pm 0.5^\circ$, $\sigma_{L11} = 11.8^\circ \pm 0.5^\circ$,

amplitude, and eccentricity distributions of the Neptune Trojans are nominally
very similar to those of the Jupiter Trojans. I use these new constraints to
inform a suite of simulations of Neptune Trojan capture by an eccentric,
rapidly-migrating Neptune from an initially dynamically-hot disk. These
simulations demonstrate that if migration and eccentricity-damping timescales
were short ($\tau_a \lesssim 10$ Myr, $\tau_e \lesssim 1$ Myr), the disk that
Neptune migrated into must have been pre-heated (prior to Neptune's appearance)
to a width comparable to the Neptune Trojans' extant width to produce a
captured population with an inclination distribution width consistent with that

have a mixture of two species, one which is influenced by the field and the

generally different, even at the same height. These facts are shown in detail
by studying a simple mechanical model: a Lorentz Gas where particles and
spinning disks interact and the particles are subjected to a constant external

popular topics in nonlinear analysis. This is done by taking intersections of
the orbit of flow by a hyper-plane parallel to one of the coordinate
hyper-planes of co-dimension one. Naturally for a 3D-attractor, the Poincare
map gives rise to 2D points, which can describe the dynamics of the attractor
properly. In a very special case, sometimes these 2D points are considered as
their 1D-projections to obtain a 1D map. However, this is an artificial way of
reducing the 2D map by dropping one of the variables. Sometimes it is found
that the two coordinates of the points on the Poincare section are functionally
related. This also reduces the 2D Poincare map to a 1D map. This reduction is
natural, and not artificial as mentioned above. In the present study, this
issue is being highlighted. In fact, we find out some examples, which show that
even this natural reduction of the 2D Poincare map is not always justified,
because the resultant 1D map may fail to generate the original dynamics. This
proves that to describe the dynamics of the 3D chaotic attractor, the minimum
dimension of the Poincare map must be two, in general.

a constant approximation algorithm for this problem is a notorious open
problem; most previous works gave constant approximations by either violating
the capacity constraints or the cardinality constraint. Notably, all these
algorithms are based on the natural LP-relaxation for the problem. The
LP-relaxation has unbounded integrality gap, even when we are allowed to
violate the capacity constraints or the cardinality constraint by a factor of
$2-\epsilon$.
  Our result is an $\exp(O(1/\epsilon^2))$-approximation algorithm for the
problem that violates the cardinality constraint by a factor of $1+\epsilon$.
This is already beyond the capability of the natural LP relaxation, as it has
unbounded integrality gap even if we are allowed to open $(2-\epsilon)k$
facilities. Indeed, our result is based on a novel LP for this problem.
  The version as we described is the hard-capacitated version of the problem,
as we can only open one facility at each location. This is as opposed to the
soft-capacitated version, in which we are allowed to open more than one
facilities at each location. We give a simple proof that in the uniform
capacitated case, the soft-capacitated version and the hard-capacitated version
are actually equivalent, up to a small constant loss in the approximation
ratio.

obtained from the semi-analytical galaxies in compact groups with those
obtained from observational data. In addition, we investigated whether the
ranking or the luminosity of a galaxy is the most important parameter in the
determination of the centre around which the clustering of faint galaxies
occurs. There is no particular influence of the extreme compact group
environment on the number of faint galaxies in such groups compared to control
groups. When selecting normal groups with separations between the 1st and 2nd
ranked galaxies similar to what is observed in compact groups, the faint galaxy
projected number density profiles in compact groups and normal groups are
similar in shape and height. We observed a similar behaviour of the population
of faint galaxies in observations and simulations in the regions closer to the

faint galaxies is higher around luminous galaxies,regardless of the ranking in

their surroundings do not represent a hostile enough environment to make faint
galaxies to behave differently than in normal groups.

sample closely matches that of Planck Collaboration XI (2013, PCXI) but our
analysis differs in several ways. We work directly in terms of physically
observable quantities, requiring minimal assumptions about the gas pressure
profile. We explicitly model the dust emission from each LBG and simultaneously
measure both the stacked tSZ and dust signals as a function of stellar mass
$M_*$. There is a small residual bias in stacked tSZ measurements; we measure
this bias and subtract it from our results, finding that the effects are
non-negligible at the lowest masses in the LBG sample. Finally, we compare our
measurements with two pressure profile models, finding that the profile from
Battaglia et al. (2012b) provides a better fit to the results than the Arnaud
et al. (2010) ""universal pressure profile."" However, within the uncertainties,
we find that the data are consistent with a self-similar scaling with mass ---
more precise measurements are needed to detect the relatively small deviations
from self-similarity predicted by these models. Consistent with PCXI, we
measure the stacked tSZ signal from LBGs with stellar masses down to
$\log_{10}(M_*/M_{\odot}) \sim 11.1-11.3$. For lower stellar masses, however,
we do not see evidence for a stacked tSZ signal. We note that the stacked dust
emission is comparable to, or larger than, the stacked tSZ signal for
$\log_{10}(M_*/M_{\odot}) \lesssim 11.3$. Future tSZ analyses with larger
samples and lower noise levels should be able to probe deviations from
self-similarity and thus provide constraints on models of feedback and the
evolution of hot halo gas over cosmic time.

plane-symmetric surfaces that would compute the total entropy of either CFT. We
suggest this to remain true of less-symmetric surfaces so that the HRT entropy
is ill-defined and some modified prescription is required. It may be possible
to simply extend HRT or the closely-related maximin construction by a limiting
procedure, though complex extremal surfaces could also play an important role.

(vcMKdV), and nonlinear Schrodinger (NLS) equations have a long history dating
from their derivation in various applications. A technique based on extended
Lax Pairs has been devised recently to derive variable-coefficient
generalizations of various Lax-integrable NLPDE hierarchies. The resulting Lax-
or S-integrable NLPDEs have both time- AND space-dependent coefficients, and
are thus more general than almost all cases considered earlier via other
methods such as the Painlev\'e Test, Bell Polynomials, and various similarity
methods.
  However, this technique, although operationally effective, has the
significant disadvantage that, for any integrable system with spatiotemporally
varying coefficients, one must 'guess' a generalization of the structure of the
known Lax Pair for the corresponding system with constant coefficients.
Motivated by the somewhat arbitrary nature of the above procedure, we embark in
this paper on an attempt to systematize the derivation of Lax-integrable
systems with variable coefficients. An ideal approach would be a method which

coefficient system, and also involves little to no guesswork. Hence we attempt
to apply the Estabrook-Wahlquist (EW) prolongation technique, a relatively
self-consistent procedure requiring little prior information.

found in a variety of disciplines, including information and communication
technology, finances, commodity trading, and real estate. A transaction in a
TON is executed as a sequence of subtransactions associated with the network
nodes, and is committed if every subtransaction is committed. A subtransaction
incurs a two-fold overhead on the host node: the fixed transient operational
cost and the cost of long-term management (e.g. archiving and support) that
potentially grows exponentially with the transaction length. If the overall
cost exceeds the node capacity, the node fails and all subtransaction incident
to the node, and their parent distributed transactions, are aborted. A TON
resilience can be measured in terms of either external workloads or intrinsic
node fault rates that cause the TON to partially or fully choke. We demonstrate
that under certain conditions, these two measures are equivalent. We further
show that the exponential growth of the long-term management costs can be
mitigated by adjusting the effective operational cost: in other words, that the
future maintenance costs could be absorbed into the transient operational
costs.

based on the relationship between structures resolved with X-ray
crystallography and the corresponding experimental chemical shifts have been
developed. These empirical predictors are very accurate on X-ray structures but
tends to be insensitive to small structural changes. To overcome this
limitation it has been suggested to make chemical shift predictors based on
quantum mechanical(QM) calculations. In this thesis the development of the QM
derived chemical shift predictor Procs14 is presented. Procs14 is based on 2.35
million density functional theory(DFT) calculations on tripeptides and contains
corrections for hydrogen bonding, ring current and the effect of the previous
and following residue. Procs14 is capable at performing predictions for the
13CA, 13CB, 13CO, 15NH, 1HN and 1HA backbone atoms. In order to benchmark
Procs14, a number of QM NMR calculations are performed on full protein
structures. Of the tested empirical and QM derived predictors, Procs14
reproduced the QM chemical shifts with the highest accuracy. A comparison with
the QM derived predictor CheShift-2 on X-ray structures and NMR ensembles with
experimental chemical shift data, showed that Procs14 predicted the chemical
shifts with the best accuracy. The predictions on the NMR ensembles exhibited
the best performance. This suggests that future work might benefit from using
ensemble sampling when performing simulations of protein folding with chemical
shifts. Procs14 is implemented in the markov chain monte carlo protein folding
framework PHAISTOS. The computational efficient implementation of Procs14
allows for rapid predictions and therefore potential use in refinement and
folding of protein structures.

that the system can be approximately balanced by solving two decoupled linear

where space separated Mott and superfluid phases coexist. Then, we analyze a
nonintegrable system, a $J-V-V'$ model with coexisting charge density wave and
superfluid phases. We find that the temporal variance of the site occupations
is a more effective measure than other standard indicators of phase boundaries
such as a local compressibility. Based on these examples, we argue that
analyzing temporal fluctuations is a valuable experimental tool for exploring
phase boundaries in trapped atom systems.

focuses on the combined impact of the microscopic cohesive energy and chain
stiffness on the magnitudes of the isobaric fragility parameter $m_P$ and the
glass transition temperature $T_g$. The computations imply that polymers with
rigid structures and weak nearest neighbor interactions are the most fragile,
while $T_g$ becomes larger when the chains are stiffer and/or nearest neighbor
interactions are stronger. Two simple fitting formulas summarize the
computations describing the dependence of $m_P$ and $T_g$ on the microscopic
cohesive and bending energies. The consideration of the combined influence of
the microscopic cohesive and bending energies leads to the identification of
some important design concepts, such as iso-fragility and iso-$T_g$ lines,
where, for instance, iso-fragility lines are contours with constant $m_P$ but
variable $T_g$. Several thermodynamic properties are found to remain invariant
along the iso-fragility lines, while no special characteristics are detected
along the iso-$T_g$ lines. Our analysis supports the widely held view that
fragility provides more fundamental insight for the description of glass
formation than $T_g$.

quantum efficiency, acquisition of DDD movies allows for correction of movement

electron beam-induced movement. Unlike specimen stage drift, beam-induced
movement is not always homogeneous within an image. Local correlation in the
trajectories of nearby particles suggests that beam-induced motion is due to
deformation of the ice layer. Algorithms have already been described that can
correct movement for large regions of frames and for > 1 MDa protein particles.
Another algorithm allows individual < 1 MDa protein particle trajectories to be
estimated, but requires rolling averages to be calculated from frames and fits
linear trajectories for particles. Here we describe an algorithm that allows
for individual < 1 MDa particle images to be aligned without frame averaging or
linear trajectories. The algorithm maximizes the overall correlation of the
shifted frames with the sum of the shifted frames. The optimum in this single
objective function is found efficiently by making use of analytically
calculated derivatives of the function. To smooth estimates of particle
trajectories, rapid changes in particle positions between frames are penalized
in the objective function and weighted averaging of nearby trajectories ensures
local correlation in trajectories. This individual particle motion correction,
in combination with weighting of Fourier components to account for increasing
radiation damage in later frames, can be used to improve 3-D maps from single

that mixes the Monte Carlo procedure with the mean field approximation. This
technique allows us to incorporate thermal fluctuations and the development of
short-range magnetic order above ordering temperatures, contrary to the crude
finite-temperature Hartree-Fock approximation, which incorrectly predicts a
N\'eel temperature $T_N$ that grows linearly with the Hubbard $U/t$. The
effective model studied here contains quantum and classical degrees of freedom.
It thus belongs to the ""spin fermion"" model family widely employed in other
contexts. Using exact diagonalization, supplemented by the traveling cluster
approximation, for the fermionic sector, and classical Monte Carlo for the
classical fields, the Hubbard $U/t$ vs. temperature $T/t$ phase diagram is
studied employing large three and two dimensional clusters. We demonstrate that
the method is capable of capturing the formation of local moments in the normal
state without long-range order, the non-monotonicity of $T_N$ with increasing
$U/t$, the development of gaps and pseudogaps in the density of states, and the
two-peak structure in the specific heat. Extensive comparisons with determinant
quantum Monte Carlo results suggest that the present approach is qualitatively,
and often quantitatively, accurate, particularly at intermediate and high
temperatures. Finally, we study the Hubbard model including plaquette diagonal
hopping (i.e. the $t-t^\prime$ Hubbard model) in two dimensions and show that
our approach allows us to study low temperature properties where determinant
quantum Monte Carlo fails due to the fermion sign problem. Future applications
of this method include multi-orbital Hubbard models such as those needed for
iron-based superconductors.

survey utilizes synergies with multi-wavelength ground and space-based surveys
to trace the evolution of spatially-resolved kinematics and star formation from
a homogeneous sample over 5 Gyrs of cosmic history. Targets, drawn from a
mass-selected parent sample from the 3D-HST survey, cover the star
formation-stellar mass ($M_*$) and rest-frame $(U-V)-M_*$ planes uniformly. We
describe the selection of targets, the observations, and the data reduction. In
the first year of data we detect Halpha emission in 191
$M_*=3\times10^{9}-7\times10^{11}$ Msun galaxies at z=0.7-1.1 and z=1.9-2.7. In
the current sample 83% of the resolved galaxies are rotation-dominated,
determined from a continuous velocity gradient and $v_{rot}/\sigma>1$, implying
that the star-forming 'main sequence' (MS) is primarily composed of rotating
galaxies at both redshift regimes. When considering additional stricter
criteria, the Halpha kinematic maps indicate at least ~70% of the resolved
galaxies are disk-like systems. Our high-quality KMOS data confirm the elevated
velocity dispersions reported in previous IFS studies at z>0.7. For
rotation-dominated disks, the average intrinsic velocity dispersion decreases
by a factor of two from 50 km/s at z~2.3 to 25 km/s at z~0.9 while the
rotational velocities at the two redshifts are comparable. Combined with
existing results spanning z~0-3, disk velocity dispersions follow an
approximate (1+z) evolution that is consistent with the dependence of velocity
dispersion on gas fractions predicted by marginally-stable disk theory.

for technological applications. In the present paper, the RIS is investigated
experimentally in polycrystalline technically pure iron (0.048%C) and in
commercial ferritic steel. The effect of the electron beam on plastic
deformation of bcc Fe is compared with that in fcc Al (99.5%). Electron energy
ranged from 0.5 to 0.8 MeV. Reversible drop of the yield stress and
radiation-induced reduction of the elongation to fracture are measured as
functions of the electron current and specimen thickness. Rate theory of RIS is
proposed, which takes into account the radiation-induced excitation of moving
discrete breathers (DBs), recently proven to exist in bcc Fe, and their
interaction with dislocations enhancing unpinning from structural defects. The
behavior of the DBs is studied using classical MD simulations providing input
for the modified rate theory, which eventually demonstrates a reasonable
agreement with experimental data. The relevance of results to the in-reactor

at a rate above its capacity and then use the second channel to send additional
side information to allow for reliable decoding at both receivers. We call this
scheme a two-phase overload-multicast strategy. We show that such a strategy is
also sum DoF optimal for the K-user MIMO BC with a parallel multicast channel
when the rate of the multicast channel is high enough and can again achieve the

$\bar{n}_P=6\times10^{-3}$ (Mpc/h)$^{-3}$. This systematic underestimation
increases with decreasing $\bar{n}_P$ and increasing $k$. Its dependence on the
intrinsic LSS fluctuations is also robustly detected. (2) All these findings
are expected by our theoretical modelling in paper I \cite{Zhang14}. In
particular, the leading order theoretical approximation agrees quantitatively
well with simulation result for $\bar{n}_P\gtrsim6\times
10^{-4}$(Mpc/h)$^{-3}$. Furthermore, we provide an ansatz to take high order
terms into account. It improves the model accuracy to $\lesssim1$% at
$k\lesssim0.1$h/Mpc over 3 orders of magnitude in $\bar{n}_P$ and over typical
LSS clustering from $z=0$ to $z=2$. (3) The sampling artifact is determined by
the deflection ${\bf D}$ field, which is straightforwardly available in both
simulations and data of galaxy velocity. Hence the sampling artifact in the
velocity power spectrum measurement can be self-calibrated within our
framework. By applying such self-calibration in simulations, it becomes
promising to determine the {\it real} large scale velocity bias of
$10^{13}M_\odot$ halos with $\sim 1$% accuracy, and that of lower mass halos by
better accuracy. ...[abridged]

algorithmic graph theory. This paper studies the treewidth of line graphs. We
show that determining the treewidth of the line graph of a graph $G$ is
equivalent to determining the minimum vertex congestion of an embedding of $G$
into a tree. Using this result, we prove sharp lower bounds in terms of both
the minimum degree and average degree of $G$. These results are precise enough
to exactly determine the treewidth of the line graph of a complete graph and
other interesting examples. We also improve the best known upper bound on the
treewidth of a line graph. Analogous results are proved for pathwidth.

of new techniques to deal with the molecular chemistry and clouds in these
objects. The atmospheres of brown dwarfs are relatively well understood, but
some problems remain, in particular the behavior of clouds at the L/T

largely limited to giant exoplanets that are hot because they are near to their

free atmosphere. However, there is also good evidence for clouds and haze in
some other planets. It is also well established that some highly irradiated
planets have inflated radii, though the mechanism for this inflation is not yet
clear. Some other issues in the composition and structure of giant exoplanet

velocity dispersions ($\sigma_{gr}$) and perform a virial analysis to obtain
the radii ($R_{200}$ and $R_{500}$) and total masses ($M_{200}$ and $M_{500}$)

of the group properties $\sigma_{gr}$, $L_{opt}$ and $L_X$, as proxies for the
group mass. Understanding how well these observables measure the total mass is
important to estimate how precisely the cluster/group mass function is
determined. Exploring the scaling relations built with the X-Bo\""otes sample
and comparing these with samples from the literature, we find a break in the
$L_X$-$M_{500}$ relation at approximately $M_{500} = 5\times10^{13}$ M$_\odot$
(for $M_{500} > 5\times10^{13}$ M$_\odot$, $M_{500} \propto L_X^{0.61\pm0.02}$,
while for $M_{500} \leq 5\times10^{13}$ M$_\odot$, $M_{500} \propto
L_X^{0.44\pm0.05}$). Thus, the mass-luminosity relation for galaxy groups
cannot be described by the same power law as galaxy clusters. A possible
explanation for this break is the dynamical friction, tidal interactions and
projection effects which reduce the velocity dispersion values of the galaxy
groups. By extending the cluster luminosity function to the group regime, we
predict the number of groups that new X-ray surveys, particularly eROSITA, will
detect. Based on our cluster/group luminosity function estimates, eROSITA will
identify $\sim$1800 groups ($L_X = 10^{41}-10^{43}$ ergs s$^{-1}$) within a
distance of 200 Mpc. Since groups lie in large scale filaments, this group
sample will map the large scale structure of the local universe.

internal rotation rates of many sub-giant and red giant stars. Unlike the
nearly rigidly rotating Sun, these evolved stars contain radiative cores that
spin faster than their overlying convective envelopes, but slower than they
would in the absence of internal angular momentum transport. We investigate the
role of internal gravity waves in angular momentum transport in evolving low
mass stars. In agreement with previous results, we find that convectively
excited gravity waves can prevent the development of strong differential
rotation in the radiative cores of Sun-like stars. As stars evolve into
sub-giants, however, low frequency gravity waves become strongly attenuated and
cannot propagate below the hydrogen burning shell, allowing the spin of the
core to decouple from the convective envelope. This decoupling occurs at the
base of the sub-giant branch when stars have surface temperatures of roughly
5500 K. However, gravity waves can still spin down the upper radiative region,
implying that the observed differential rotation is likely confined to the deep
core near the hydrogen burning shell. The torque on the upper radiative region
may also prevent the core from accreting high-angular momentum material and
slow the rate of core spin-up. The observed spin-down of cores on the red giant
branch cannot be totally attributed to gravity waves, but the waves may enhance
shear within the radiative region and thus increase the efficacy of
viscous/magnetic torques.

Although the optical characterization of these polytypic structures is well

phase mixing and quantum confinement change the output linear light
polarization is still needed. In this paper, we theoretically investigate the
mixing effects of wurtzite and zinc-blende phases on the interband absorption
and in the degree of light polarization of an InP polytypic superlattice. We
use a single 8$\times$8 k$\cdot$p Hamiltonian that describes both crystal
phases. Quantum confinement is investigated by changing the size of the
polytypic unit cell. We also include the optical confinement effect due to the
dielectric mismatch between the superlattice and the vaccum and we show it to
be necessary to match experimental results. Our calculations for large wurtzite
concentrations and small quantum confinement explain the optical trends of
recent photoluminescence excitation measurements. Furthermore, we find a high
sensitivity to zinc-blende concentrations in the degree of linear polarization.
This sensitivity can be reduced by increasing quantum confinement. In
conclusion, our theoretical analysis provides an explanation for optical trends
in InP polytypic superlattices, and shows that the interplay of crystal phase

deblurring has attracted growing attention in recent years. From the viewpoint
of how to handle the ill-posedness which is a crucial issue in deblurring
tasks, existing methods can be grouped into five categories: Bayesian inference
framework, variational methods, sparse representation-based methods,
homography-based modeling, and region-based methods. In spite of achieving a

limited in its success by complex application conditions which make the blur

$\propto t_{\beta}s_{\xi}$ in the limit $t_{\beta}s_{\xi}\rightarrow0$ (see
text for definitions of $t_\beta$ and $\xi$), namely the CP conservation limit.
Here $K$ and $J$ are the measures for CP-violation effects in scalar and Yukawa
sectors respectively. It is a new way to understand why the Higgs boson
discovered at the LHC is light. We investigated the important constraints from
both high energy LHC data and numerous low energy experiments, especially the
measurements of EDMs of electron and neutron as well as the quantities of
B-meson and kaon. Confronting all data, we found that this model is still
viable. It should be emphasized that there is no standard-model limit for this
scenario, thus it is always testable for future experiments. In order to pin
down Lee model, it is important to discover the extra neutral and charged Higgs
bosons and measure their CP properties and the flavor-changing decays. At the
LHC with $\sqrt{s}=14\textrm{TeV}$, this scenario is favored if there is
significant suppression in the $b\bar{b}$ decay channel or any vector boson
fusion (VBF), V+H production channels. On the contrary, it will be disfavored

equilibrium part, i.e., $\alpha\equiv \mu/T$, $\beta\equiv1/T$ (where $T$ is
separation temperature and $\mu$ is separation chemical potential introduced to
separate equilibrium part from the off-equilibrium state), a dissipative
strength $\gamma$ is newly introduced to specify the off-equilibrium state.

$\varepsilon$, $n$ and $P_{\rm

theoretical definitions and the thermodynamical stability condition. For

relativistic motion on the quantum Fisher information of (1+1) Dirac field
modes confined to cavities. %For this purpose, a bipartite system comprising of
Alice's and Rob's cavities with appropriate boundary conditions is prepared.
For the purpose, we consider the situation that Rob's cavity, initially
inertial, accelerates uniformly with respect to its proper time and then again
becomes inertial while Alice's cavity remains inertial. The acceleration is
assumed to be very small and its effects were analyzed in a perturbative
regime. For analysis, we consider $\theta$ parameterized two-qubit pure
entangled state and a Werner state. In contrast to the degradation of
entanglement due to the relativistic motion between the cavities, the quantum
Fisher information of the pure composite system $\mathcal{F}_\theta$ with
respect to parameter $\theta$ is found to be invariant under the same
conditions. However, in the case of the Werner state, the quantum Fisher
information displays periodic degradation, due to the inertial and non-inertial
segments of motion. Further, we investigate how this evolution process affects
the quantum Fisher information distribution over the subsystems of Alice's and
Rob's cavities. We find that the quantum Fisher information over the Rob's
cavity shows the periodic degradation behavior depending upon the parameter
$\theta$ as well as the uniform acceleration for both the two qubit pure state
and Werner state. The quantum Fisher information over Alice's cavity remains
invariant throughout the motion of Rob's cavity for the two qubit pure state
whereas for Werner state it is affected by the mixing parameter of the Werner
state.

phenomenon in this case is the magnetic field dependence of electrical
resistance, or magnetoresistance (MR). The intricate interplay between
topological protection and broken-TRS may lead to highly unconventional MR
behaviour that can find unique applications in magnetic sensing and data
storage. However, so far the MR of TI with spontaneously broken TRS is still
poorly understood, mainly due to the lack of well-controlled experiments. In
this work, we investigate the magneto transport properties of a ferromagnetic
TI thin film fabricated into a field effect transistor device. We observe an
unusually complex evolution of MR when the Fermi level (EF) is tuned across the
Dirac point (DP) by gate voltage. In particular, MR tends to be positive when
EF lies close to the DP but becomes negative at higher energies. This trend is
opposite to that expected from the Berry phase picture for localization, but is
intimately correlated with the gate-tuned magnetic order. We show that the
underlying physics is the competition between the topology-induced weak
antilocalization and magnetism-induced negative MR. The simultaneous electrical
control of magnetic order and magneto transport facilitates future TI-based

attributed to Fom b, a companion detected near the belt inner-edge, but new
constraints on its orbit revealed that it is belt-crossing, highly eccentric
$(e \sim 0.6-0.9)$, and can hardly account for the shape of the belt. The best
scenario to explain this paradox is that there is another massive body in this
system, Fom c, which drives the debris disk shape. The resulting planetary
system is highly unstable, which hints at a dynamical scenario involving a
recent scattering of Fom b on its current orbit, potentially with the putative
Fom c.
  Our goal is to give insights on the probability for Fom b to have been set on
its highly eccentric orbit by a close-encounter with the putative Fom c. We aim
to study in particular the part played by mean-motion resonances with Fom c,
which could have brought Fom b sufficiently close to Fom c for it to be
scattered on its current orbit, but also delay this scattering event.
  Using N-body simulations, we found that the generation of orbits similar to
that of Fom b, either in term of dimensions or orientation, is a robust process
involving a scattering event and a further secular evolution of inner material
with an eccentric massive body such as the putative Fom c. We found in
particular that mean-motion resonances can delay scattering events, and thus
the production of Fom b-like orbits, on timescales comparable to the age of the
system, thus explaining the witnessing of an unstable configuration.
  We conclude that Fom b probably originated from an inner resonance with Fom
c, which is at least Neptune-Saturn size, and was set on its current orbit by a
scattering event with Fom c. Since Fom b could not have formed from material in
resonance, our scenario also hints at former migration processes in this
planetary system.

improve constraints on an admixture of adiabatic and three correlated

on isocurvature modes by at most 10% for the {\planck} and {\prism}

isocurvature lensing spectra and cancellations between these spectra rendering
them only slightly detectable. There is a larger gain from using the

addition of both lensing and lensing-induced B-mode polarization information
constrains isocurvature mode amplitudes at the few percent level or better,
with percent level constraints or better possible in the case of admixtures of
the adiabatic mode with one or two correlated isocurvature modes. We
investigate the dependence of our results to various assumptions in our

grains evolve. For instance, some analyses of cold clumps (7 K- 17 K) indicate
that the aggregation process is favored in dense environments. However,
studying warm (30 K-40 K) dust emission at long wavelength ($\lambda$$>$300
$\mu$m) has been limited because it is difficult to combine far
infared-to-millimeter (FIR-to-mm) spectral coverage and high angular resolution
for observations of warm dust grains. Using Herschel data from 70 to 500
$\mu$m, which are part of the Herschel infrared Galactic (Hi-GAL) survey
combined with 1.1 mm data from the Bolocam Galactic Plane Survey (BGPS), we
compared emission in two types of environments: ultra-compact HII (UCHII)
regions, and cold molecular clumps (denoted as cold clumps). With this
comparison we tested dust emission models in the FIR-to-mm domain that
reproduce emission in the diffuse medium, in these two environments (UCHII
regions and cold clumps). We also investigated their ability to predict the
dust emission in our Galaxy. We determined the emission spectra in twelve UCHII
regions and twelve cold clumps, and derived the dust temperature (T) using the
recent two-level system (TLS) model with three sets of parameters and the
so-called T-$\beta$ (temperature-dust emissvity index) phenomenological models,
with $\beta$ set to 1.5, 2 and 2.5. We tested the applicability of the TLS
model in warm regions for the first time. This analysis indicates distinct
trends in the dust emission between cold and warm environments that are visible
through changes in the dust emissivity index. However, with the use of standard
parameters, the TLS model is able to reproduce the spectral behavior observed
in cold and warm regions, from the change of the dust temperature alone,
whereas a T-$\beta$ model requires $\beta$ to be known.

behaviour of groups of intelligent agents. We first develop a highly general
abstract model for the possible future lives that these agents may encounter as
a result of their decisions. In the context of these possible futures, we show
that the causal entropic principle, whereby agents follow behavioural rules
that maximise their entropy over all paths through the future, predicts many of
the observed features of social interactions between individuals in both human
and animal groups. Our results indicate that agents are often able to maximise
their future path entropy by remaining cohesive as a group, and that this
cohesion leads to collectively intelligent outcomes that depend strongly on the
distribution of the number of future paths that are possible. We derive social
interaction rules that are consistent with maximum-entropy group behaviour for
both discrete and continuous decision spaces. Our analysis further predicts
that social interactions are likely to be fundamentally based on Weber's law of
response to proportional stimuli, supporting many studies that find a
neurological basis for this stimulus-response mechanism, and providing a novel
basis for the common assumption of linearly additive 'social forces' in
simulation studies of collective behaviour.

to communicate as well as the user's signature. As long as no more than $K$
users collide, their identities can be recovered from the sum of their

strongly affected by {\em macroscopic} thermal-coupling conditions: the thermal
runaway observed in previous studies in DTO can be suppressed altogether by
immersing the sample in liquid helium. Crystal-electric-field effects having

symplectic geometry (see e.g. arXiv:1106.4882), as the geometric structure on
moduli spaces of $J$-holomorphic curves. An alternative to Kuranishi spaces is
the 'polyfolds' of Hofer, Wysocki and Zehnder (see e.g. arXiv:1407.3185).
Finding a satisfactory definition of Kuranishi space has been the subject of
recent debate (see e.g. arXiv:1208.1340, arXiv:1209.4410, arXiv:1510.06849).
  We propose three new definitions of Kuranishi space: a simple 'manifold'
version, '$\mu$-Kuranishi spaces', which form an ordinary category
$\boldsymbol\mu\bf Kur$; a more complicated 'manifold' version, 'm-Kuranishi
spaces', which form a weak 2-category $\bf mKur$; and an 'orbifold' version,
'Kuranishi spaces', which form a weak 2-category $\bf Kur$. These are related
by an equivalence of categories $\boldsymbol\mu{\bf Kur}\simeq{\rm Ho}({\bf
mKur})$, where ${\rm Ho}({\bf mKur})$ is the homotopy category of $\bf mKur$,
and by a full and faithful embedding ${\bf mKur}\hookrightarrow\bf Kur$. We
also define ($\mu$-, m-)Kuranishi spaces with boundary, and with corners. We
hope our definitions will become accepted as final, replacing previous
definitions.
  Any Fukaya-Oh-Ohta-Ono Kuranishi space $\bf X$ can be made into a compact
Kuranishi space $\bf X'$ uniquely up to equivalence in $\bf Kur$ (that is, up
to isomorphism in ${\rm Ho}({\bf Kur})$). The same holds for topological spaces
with Fukaya-Oh-Ohta-Ono 'good coordinate systems', and for McDuff and
Wehrheim's 'Kuranishi atlases' in arXiv:1508.01556. A compact topological space
$\bf X$ with a 'polyfold Fredholm structure' in the sense of Hofer, Wysocki and
Zehnder can be made into a Kuranishi space $\bf X$ uniquely up to equivalence
in $\bf Kur$.

particular, we show that a periodic array of them leads to sharp dips in the
transmission function at certain frequencies $\omega_{\nu}$ which can be
pre-defined as desired by controlling their relative distance and size. With
this, we demonstrated that by adequate engineering it is possible to govern the
magnitude of the ballistic transmission functions T$(\omega)$ in graphene
nanoribbons. We discuss the implications of these results in the design of
controlled thermal transport at the nanoscale as well as in the enhancement of
thermo-electric features of graphene-based materials.

what to do, how to do it, in what order, like a fully equipped kitchen without

demand for an adequate, object-oriented real-time methodology. We show how to
scan the methodology market in order to adopt an already existing method for
this purpose. The result of the adaptation of a chosen method to ASCET SD is a
pragmatic version of ROOM, which we call BROOM. We present a modeling guidebook
that includes process recommendations not only for the automotive sector, but
for real-time software development in general. The method suggests to produce
early prototypes that are validated and refined to completion. BROOM offers
phase-independent, harmonic guidelines. Product requirements, in form of
scenarios, are transformed through several activities into operational models.
BROOM takes advantage of ASCET's rich experimentation- and code generation
features. These allow to validate emerging models on button press. The factual
development of a simplified heating/cooling system at BMW serves as a running

compact binary systems, which constitute the prime targets of the upcoming
network of gravitational-wave detectors. We refine the theoretical description
of tidal interactions (hitherto known only to the second post-Newtonian level)
by extending our recently developed analytic self-force formalism, for extreme
mass-ratio binary systems, to the computation of several tidal invariants.
Specifically, we compute, to linear order in the mass ratio and to the
7.5$^{\rm th}$ post-Newtonian order, the following tidal invariants: the square
and the cube of the gravitoelectric quadrupolar tidal tensor, the square of the
gravitomagnetic quadrupolar tidal tensor, and the square of the gravitoelectric
octupolar tidal tensor. Our high-accuracy analytic results are compared to
recent numerical self-force tidal data by Dolan et al. \cite{Dolan:2014pja},
and, notably, provide an analytic understanding of the light ring asymptotic
behavior found by them. We transcribe our kinematical tidal-invariant results
in the more dynamically significant effective one-body description of the tidal
interaction energy. By combining, in a synergetic manner, analytical and
numerical results, we provide simple, accurate analytic representations of the
global, strong-field behavior of the gravitoelectric quadrupolar tidal factor.
A striking finding is that the linear-in-mass-ratio piece in the latter tidal
factor changes sign in the strong-field domain, to become negative (while its
previously known second post-Newtonian approximant was always positive). We,
however, argue that this will be more than compensated by a probable fast
growth, in the strong-field domain, of the nonlinear-in-mass-ratio
contributions in the tidal factor.

can be shared only among quantum systems. The Heisenberg chain is one of the
simplest quantum chains which exhibits a reach entanglement feature, due to the
Heisenberg interaction is quantum coupling in the spin system. The two
particles were coupled trough XYZ coupling or simply called as two-qubit XYZ
spin, which are the responsible for the emergence of thermal entanglement.
These two-qubit operators are bonded to two nodal Ising spins, and this process
is repeated infinitely resulting in a diamond chain structure. We will discuss
two-qubit thermal entanglement effect on Ising-XYZ diamond chain structure. The
concurrence could be obtained straightforwardly in terms of two-qubit density
operator elements, using this result, we study the thermal entanglement, as
well as the threshold temperature where entangled state vanishes. The present
model displays a quite unusual concurrence behavior, such as, the boundary of
two entangled regions becomes a disentangled region, this is intrinsically
related to the XY-anisotropy in the Heisenberg coupling. Despite a similar
property had been found for only two-qubit, here we show in the case of a
diamond chain structure, which reasonably represents real materials.

ancillary services in a large power grid. In prior work by the authors a
randomized control architecture is introduced for individual loads for this

so that control of the loads is easy at the grid level: Tracking of a balancing
authority reference signal is possible, while ensuring that the quality of
service (QoS) for each load is acceptable on average. The analysis was based on
a mean field limit (as the number of loads approaches infinity), combined with
an LTI-system approximation of the aggregate nonlinear model. This paper
examines in depth the issue of individual risk in these systems. The main
contributions of the paper are of two kinds:
  Risk is modeled and quantified:
  (i) The average performance is not an adequate measure of success. It is
found empirically that a histogram of QoS is approximately Gaussian, and
consequently each load will eventually receive poor service.
  (ii) The variance can be estimated from a refinement of the LTI model that
includes a white-noise disturbance; variance is a function of the randomized
policy, as well as the power spectral density of the reference signal.
  Additional local control can eliminate risk:
  (iii) The histogram of QoS is truncated through this local control, so that
strict bounds on service quality are guaranteed.
  (iv) This has insignificant impact on the grid-level performance, beyond a
modest reduction in capacity of ancillary service.

structures characterized by locally lower values of the expansion factor are
embedded in a smooth background. These loop-like flux-tubes have squashed
cross-sections and expand with height. The distribution of the expansion
factors show overall increase with height, allowing an active region core
characterized by low values of the expansion factor to be distinguished. The
area expansion factors obtained from extrapolation of the SOT magnetogram are
compared to those obtained from an approximation of the observed magnetogram by
a series of 134 submerged charges. This approximation retains the general flux
distribution in the observed magnetogram, but removes the small-scale structure
in both the approximated magnetogram and the 3D distribution of the area

a significant ingredient in producing the observed structuring of the solar
corona. However, due to the potential approximation used, these results may not
be applicable to loops exhibiting twist neither to active regions producing

of the cool, chemically peculiar star HD 24712. This is the very first such
analysis performed at a resolving power exceeding 10^5.
  Methods: The analysis is performed on the basis of phase-resolved
observations of line profiles in all four Stokes parameters obtained with the
HARPSpol instrument attached at the 3.6-m ESO telescope. We use the magnetic
Doppler imaging code, INVERS10, which allows us to derive the magnetic field
geometry and surface chemical abundance distributions simultaneously.
  Results: We report magnetic maps of HD 24712 recovered from a selection of
FeI, FeII, NdIII, and NaI lines with strong polarization signals in all Stokes
parameters. Our magnetic maps successfully reproduce most of the details
available from our observation data. We used these magnetic field maps to
produce abundance distribution map of Ca. This new analysis shows that the
surface magnetic field of HD 24712 has a dominant dipolar component with a weak
contribution from higher-order harmonics. The surface abundance distributions
of Fe and Ca show enhancements near the magnetic equator with an underabundant
patch at the visible (positive) magnetic pole; Nd is highly abundant around the
positive magnetic pole. The Na abundance map shows a high overabundance around
the negative magnetic pole.
  Conclusions: Based on our investigation and similar recent four Stokes
parameter magnetic mapping studies, we present a tentative evidence for the
hypothesis that Ap stars with dipole-like fields are older than stars with
magnetic fields that have more small-scale structures. We find that our
abundance maps are inconsistent with recent theoretical calculations of atomic
diffusion in presence of magnetic fields.

stars distributed in distance and direction allows reconstructing the
distribution of interstellar matter (ISM) in 3D. A low resolution IS dust map
based on the reddening of 23,000 stars illustrates the potential of future
maps. It reveals the location of the main IS clouds within $\sim$1kpc and,
owing to biases towards weakly reddened targets, regions devoid of IS matter.
It traces the Local Bubble and neighboring cavities, including a giant,
$\geq$1000 pc long cavity located beyond the so-called $\beta$CMa tunnel,
bordered by the main constituents of the Gould belt (GB), the rotating and
expanding ring of clouds and young stars, inclined by $\sim$ 20$^{\circ}$ to
the galactic plane. From comparison with diffuse X-ray background and
absorption data it appears that the giant cavity is filled with warm, ionized
and dust-poor gas in addition to million K gas. This set of structures must
reflect the main events that occurred in the past. It has been suggested that
the Cretaceus-Tertiary mass extinction may be due to a gamma-ray burst (GRB) in
the massive globular cluster (GC) 47 Tuc during its close encounter with the
Sun $\sim$70 Myrs ago. Given the mass, speed and size of 47 Tuc, wherever it
crossed the Galactic plane it must have produced at the crossing site
significant dynamical effects on the disk stars and IS clouds, and triggered
star formation. Interestingly, first-order estimates suggest that the GB
dynamics and age could match the consequences of the cluster crossing.
Additionally, the giant ionized, dust-free cavity could be related to an
intense flux of hard radiation, and dust-gas decoupling after the burst could
explain the high variability and pattern of the D/H ratio in the nearby gaseous
ISM. Future Gaia data should confirm or dismiss this hypothesis.

measure the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich signal as a function of central galaxy stellar
mass. Here, we stack the X-ray emission from these halos using data from the
ROSAT All-Sky Survey. We detect emission across almost our entire sample,
including emission which we attribute to hot gas around galaxies spanning a
range of 1.2 dex in stellar mass (corresponding to nearly two orders of
magnitude in halo mass) down to $M* = 10^{10.8} M_{\odot}$ ($M_{500} \approx
10^{12.6} M_{\odot}$). Over this range, the X-ray luminosity can be fit by a
power-law, either of stellar mass or of halo mass. A single unified scaling
relation between mass and $L_X$ applies for galaxies, groups, and clusters.
This relation has a steeper slope than expected for self-similarity, in
contrast to the $Y_{SZ}$-$M_{500}$ relation, showing the importance of
non-gravitational heating. If this heating is predominantly due to AGN
feedback, the lack of a break in our relation suggests that AGN feedback is
tightly self-regulated and fairly gentle, in agreement with recent
high-resolution simulations. Our results are consistent with earlier
measurements of the $L_X$-$L_K$ relation for elliptical galaxies and of the
$L_X$-$M_{500}$ relation for optically-selected galaxy clusters. However, our
$L_X$-$M_{500}$ relation lies more than a factor of two below most previous
relations based on X-ray-selected cluster samples. We argue that optical
selection offers a less biased view of the $L_X$-$M_{500}$ relation.

and CMB spectral distortions, and we calculate the predicted fluxes of diffuse
gamma ray cascade photons and cosmic rays. For strings as light as TeV, we find
that the predicted level of these signatures is well below the sensitivity of
the current experiments, and therefore low scale cosmic strings in hidden
sectors remain unconstrained. Heavier strings with a mass scale in the range
10^(13) GeV to 10^(15) GeV are at tension with nucleosynthesis constraints.

and data analysis. Fitting regression mixtures is challenging and is usually
performed by maximum likelihood by using the expectation-maximization (EM)
algorithm. However, it is well-known that the initialization is crucial for EM.
If the initialization is inappropriately performed, the EM algorithm may lead
to unsatisfactory results. The EM algorithm also requires the number of
clusters to be given a priori; the problem of selecting the number of mixture
components requires using model selection criteria to choose one from a set of
pre-estimated candidate models. We propose a new fully unsupervised algorithm
to learn regression mixture models with unknown number of components. The
developed unsupervised learning approach consists in a penalized maximum
likelihood estimation carried out by a robust expectation-maximization (EM)
algorithm for fitting polynomial, spline and B-spline regressions mixtures. The
proposed learning approach is fully unsupervised: 1) it simultaneously infers
the model parameters and the optimal number of the regression mixture
components from the data as the learning proceeds, rather than in a two-fold
scheme as in standard model-based clustering using afterward model selection
criteria, and 2) it does not require accurate initialization unlike the
standard EM for regression mixtures. The developed approach is applied to curve
clustering problems. Numerical experiments on simulated data show that the
proposed robust EM algorithm performs well and provides accurate results in
terms of robustness with regard initialization and retrieving the optimal
partition with the actual number of clusters. An application to real data in
the framework of functional data clustering, confirms the benefit of the
proposed approach for practical applications.

to the end of the Late Bronze Age (950 B.C.). These structures, commonly

ranging from 140 to 250 m. At present the perimetrical earthen embankments
reach a maximum base width of 18 m and an elevation of more than 5 m the
surrounding plain in their best preserved parts. These three sites were often
reported in the literature to have the corners aligned to the cardinal
directions. Aveni and Romano (1986) included two of them (Galleriano and

tentatively proposing astronomically relevant alignments for some sides and
diagonals. Inspired by this pioneering work and by the renovated archaeological

earthworks and re-analyzed their orientation. Our study does not confirm the

requirements for fluid models of plasma to allow converged simulations that
agree well with converged kinetic simulations of fast magnetic reconnection. We
show that truncation closure for the deviatoric pressure or for the heat flux
results in singularities. Due to the strong pressure anisotropies that arise,
we study magnetic reconnection with a Gaussian-moment two-fluid MHD with
isotropization of the pressure tensor. For the GEM magnetic reconnection
challenge problem, our deviatoric pressure tensor agrees well with published
kinetic simulations at the time of peak reconnection, but sometime thereafter
the numerical solution becomes unpredictable and develops near-singularities
that crash the simulation unless positivity limiters are applied. To explain
these difficulties, we show that steady reconnection requires heat flux.
Specifically, for two-dimensional problems invariant under 180-degree rotation
about the X-point, entropy production in the vicinity of the X-point is
necessary for reconnection and causes solutions to become singular for
conservative models that lack heat flux. This prompts the need for a 10-moment
gyrotropic heat flux closure. Using a Chapman-Enskog expansion with a
Gaussian-BGK collision operator yields a heat flux closure for a magnetized
10-moment charged gas which generalizes the closure of McDonald and Groth.

transition rate depends on the length $\ell$ of inactive sites according to $1
+ a \ell^{-\sigma}$, where $a$ and $\sigma$ are control parameters. In the
absence of diffusion, this system presents both a discontinuous and a
continuous phase transition, depending on the value of $\sigma$. The inclusion
of diffusion in this model has been investigated by numerical simulations and
mean-field calculations. Results show that there exists three distinct regimes.
For sufficiently low and large $\sigma$'s the transition is respectively always
discontinuous or continuous, independently of the strength of the diffusion. On
the other hand, in an intermediate range of $\sigma$'s, the diffusion causes a
suppression of the phase coexistence leading to a continuous transition
belonging to the DP universality class. This set of results does not agree with
mean-field predictions, whose reasons will be discussed further.

  cubic building with two large opposite openings","Ninth International IBPSA Conference, Montr\'eal : Canada (2005)",,,,"physics.flu-dyn","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The aim of this paper is to show the influence of the atmospheric boundary
layer profile on the distribution of velocity in a building having two large
openings. The knowledge of the flow form inside a building is useful to define
a thermal environment favourable with thermal comfort and good air quality. In
computational fluid dynamics, several profiles of atmospheric boundary layer
can be used like logarithmic profiles or power profiles. This paper shows the
impact of these profiles on the indoor airflow. Non-ventilated or ventilated
parts of room are found. They show respectively ineffective ventilation and
effective ventilation. A qualitative and global approach allows to observe the
flows in a cubic building and to show the influence of each profile according
to the external ground roughness and the incidence angle of the wind. Some
zones, where occupants move, are named volumes of life. Ventilation is there
observed using traditional tools in order to analyze quantitatively the
ventilation of these zones.

thermal noise and the sensor signal to noise ratio are calculated theoretically
based on the dimensions and geometry of the coil winding and its core. Our
calculations indicate that the equivalent magnetic field of the thermal noise
can be minimized by the coil to core weight ratio. Moreover, it is found that
the sensor signal to noise ratio can be maximized with only a special value of
core aspect ratio length to diameter of core ratio. The calculation results
here exhibit good agreement with the experimentally measured noise data.

induced voltage generation on OTS SAM coated Si wafers/ Uncoated Si wafers at
modest gas flow velocities of subsonic regime (Mach number < 0.2) using
national instruments NI-PXI-1044 Workstation. The gas flow driven voltage
generation is mainly due to the interplay mechanisms of Bernoulli principle and
Seebeck effect. The surface morphology of OTS SAM coated p-Si and n-Si wafers
were characterized by SEM analysis. In this study, our results shows that OTS
SAM coated p-Si and n-Si wafers shows better sensitivity towards nitrogen gas
flow when compared with the uncoated Si wafers. OTS SAM also exhibits high
thermal stability and hydrophobicity.

network theory. Words in given texts are linked by co-occurrence and
transformed into networks, and we observe that these display topological
properties common to other complex systems. However, there are some properties
that seem to be exclusive to texts; many of these properties depend on the
frequency of words in the text, while others seem to be strictly determined by
the grammar. Precisely, these properties allow for a categorization of texts as
either with a sense and others encoded or senseless.

Poincare map is one of the fascinating mathematical tool, which can describe
the approximate behaviour of the dynamics of the dynamical system in lesser

rare biomedical signal like Electromyography (EMG) signal. It determines
suitable time delay and reconstruct the attractor of embedding diemnsion three.
By measuring its Lyapunov exponent, the attractor so reconstructed is found to
be chaotic. Naturally the Poincare map obtained by corresponding Poincare
section is to be chaotic too. This may be verified by calculation of Lyapunov
exponent of the map. The main objective of this article is to show that
Poincare map exists in this case as a 2D map for a suitable Poincare section
only. In fact, the article considers two Poincare sections of the attractor for
construction of the Poincare map. It is seen that one such map is chaotic but
the other one is not so, both are verified by calculation of Lyapunov exponent
of the map.
