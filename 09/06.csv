approach to constrain the orbit elements of all systems that showed significant
differential motion of the primary star and companion. We show for the first
time that the GQ Lup system shows significant change in both separation and
position angle. Our analysis yields best fitting orbits for this system, which
are eccentric (e between 0.21 and 0.69), but can not rule out circular orbits
at high inclinations. Given our astrometry we discuss formation scenarios of
the GQ Lup system. In addition, we detected an even fainter new companion
candidate to GQ Lup, which is most likely a background object. We also updated
the orbit constraints of the PZ Tel system, confirming that the companion is on
a highly eccentric orbit with e > 0.62. Finally we show with a high

a sample of about 1700 blazars every three days at 15 GHz, with the main
scientific goal of determining the relation between the variability of blazars
at radio and gamma-rays as observed with the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope.
The time domain relation between radio and gamma-ray emission, in particular
its correlation and time lag, can help us determine the location of the
high-energy emission site in blazars, a current open question in blazar
research. To achieve this goal, continuous observation of a large sample of
blazars in a time scale of less than a week is indispensable. Since we only
look at bright targets, the time available for target observations is mostly
limited by source observability, calibration requirements and slewing of the
telescope. Here I describe the implementation of a practical solution to this
scheduling, calibration, and slewing time minimization problem. This solution
combines ideas from optimization, in particular the traveling salesman problem,
with astronomical and instrumental constraints. A heuristic solution using well
stablished optimization techniques and astronomical insights particular to this
situation, allow us to observe all the sources in the required three days
cadence while obtaining reliable calibration of the radio flux densities.
Problems of this nature will only be more common in the future and the ideas
presented here can be relevant for other observing programs.

simple absorbed two power law model to the XMM data, the presence of CT AGN was
confirmed in 80% of the sources using deeper Chandra data and more complex

of redshift and luminosity. We collected the multi-wavelength information
available for all these sources, in order to study the distribution of SMBH and
host properties, such as BH mass (M_BH), Eddington ratio (\lambda_Edd), stellar
mass (M*), specific star formation rate (sSFR) in comparison with a sample of
unobscured AGN. We find that highly obscured sources tend to have significantly
smaller M_BH and higher \lambda_edd with respect to unobscured ones, while a
weaker evolution in M* is observed. The sSFR of highly obscured sources is
consistent with the one observed in the main sequence of star forming galaxies,
at all redshift. We also present optical spectra, spectral energy distribution
(SED) and morphology for the sample of 10 CT AGN: all the available optical
spectra are dominated by the stellar component of the host galaxy, and a highly
obscured torus component is needed in the SED of the CT sources. Exploiting the
high resolution Hubble-ACS images available, we conclude that these highly
obscured sources have a significantly larger merger fraction with respect to
other X-ray selected samples of AGN. Finally we discuss implications in the

we show that the anisotropic cVdW many body interactions drive the formation of
low-dimensional structures such as chains, membranes and vesicles with very
unusual, non-local properties. In particular, cVdW chains display a
logarithmically growing stiffness with the chain length, while cVdW membranes
have a bending modulus growing linearly with their size. We argue that the cVdW

climate which was likely sustained by a stronger greenhouse effect, the
so-called Faint Young Sun Problem (FYSP). CO2 and CH4 are generally thought to
be the mainstays of this enhanced greenhouse, though many other gases have been
proposed. We present high accuracy radiative forcings for CO2, CH4 and 26 other
gases, performing the radiative transfer calculations at line-by-line
resolution and using HITRAN 2012 line data for background pressures of 0.5, 1,
and 2 bar of atmospheric N2. For CO2 to resolve the FYSP alone at 2.8 Gyr BP
(80% of present solar luminosity), 0.32 bar is needed with 0.5 bar of
atmospheric N2, 0.20 bar with 1 bar of atmospheric N2, or 0.11 bar with 2 bar
of atmospheric N2. For CH4, we find that near-infrared absorption is much
stronger than previously thought, arising from updates to the HITRAN database.
CH4 radiative forcing peaks at 10.3, 9, or 8.3 Wm-2 for background pressures of
0.5, 1 or 2 bar, likely limiting the utility of CH4 for warming the Archean.
For the other 26 HITRAN gases, radiative forcings of up to a few to 10 Wm-2 are
obtained from concentrations of 0.1-1 ppmv for many gases. For the 20 strongest
gases, we calculate the reduction in radiative forcing due to overlap. We also
tabulate the modern sources, sinks, concentrations and lifetimes of these gases
and summaries the literature on Archean sources and concentrations. We
recommend the forcings provided here be used both as a first reference for
which gases are likely good greenhouse gases, and as a standard set of
calculations for validation of radiative forcing calculations for the Archean.

model is used to develop relations by which the density and velocity of each
flow can be predicted from coronal parameters including the flare's energy flux
$F$. These relations are explored and refined using a series of numerical
investigations in which the transition region is represented by a simplified
density jump. The maximum evaporation velocity, for example, is well
approximated by $v_e\simeq0.38(F/\rho_{co,0})^{1/3}$, where $\rho_{co,0}$ is
the mass density of the pre-flare corona. This and the other relations are
found to fit simulations using more realistic models of the transition region
both performed in this work, and taken from a variety of previously published
investigations. These relations offer a novel and efficient means of simulating
coronal reconnection without neglecting entirely the effects of evaporation.

chains and vortex rings. Generically, they describe composite configurations
with several individual components, possesing a nonzero magnetic charge, even
in the absence of a Higgs field. Such Yang-Mills configurations exist already
in the probe limit, the AdS geometry supplying the attractive force needed to
balance the repulsive force of Yang-Mills gauge interactions. The gravitating
solutions are constructed by numerically solving the elliptic
Einstein-DeTurck--Yang-Mills equations. The variation of the gravitational
coupling constant $\alpha$ reveals the existence of two branches of gravitating
solutions which bifurcate at some critical value of $\alpha$. The lower energy
branch connects to the solutions in the global AdS spacetime, while the upper
branch is linked to the generalized Bartnik-McKinnon solutions in
asymptotically flat spacetime. Also, a spherically symmetric, closed form
solution is found as a perturbation around the globally anti-de Sitter vacuum
state.

particular focusing on the role of the Higgs boson. This production channel
receives contributions both from Higgs boson-mediated diagrams via the decay $H
\to ZZ$ (signal diagrams), as well as from diagrams where the Z-bosons couple
directly to a quark loop (background diagrams). We consider the partonic
processes $gggZZ$ and $gq \bar{q} ZZ$ in which interference between signal and
background diagrams first occurs. Since interference is primarily an
off-resonant effect for the Higgs boson, we treat the Z-bosons as on-shell.
Thus our analysis is limited to the region above threshold, where the invariant
mass of the Z-pair, $m_{ZZ}$, satisfies the condition $m_{ZZ}>2m_Z$. In the
region $m_{ZZ} > 300$ GeV we find that the interference in the ZZ + jet channel
is qualitatively similar to interference in the inclusive ZZ channel. Moreover,
the rates are sufficient to study these effects at the LHC once jet-binned data
become available.

potential for creating inexpensive and flexible devices easily processed on a
large scale [1-11]. However technological applications are currently limited by
the low mobility of the charge carriers associated with the disorder in these
materials [5-8]. Much effort over the past decades has therefore been focused
on optimizing the organisation of the material or the devices to improve
carrier mobility. Here we take a radically different path to solving this
problem, namely by injecting carriers into states that are hybridized to the
vacuum electromagnetic field. These are coherent states that can extend over as
many as 10^5 molecules and should thereby favour conductivity in such
materials. To test this idea, organic semiconductors were strongly coupled to
the vacuum electromagnetic field on plasmonic structures to form polaritonic
states with large Rabi splittings ca. 0.7 eV. Conductivity experiments show
that indeed the current does increase by an order of magnitude at resonance in
the coupled state, reflecting mostly a change in field-effect mobility as
revealed when the structure is gated in a transistor configuration. A
theoretical quantum model is presented that confirms the delocalization of the
wave-functions of the hybridized states and the consequences on the
conductivity. While this is a proof-of-principle study, in practice
conductivity mediated by light-matter hybridized states is easy to implement
and we therefore expect that it will be used to improve organic devices. More
broadly our findings illustrate the potential of engineering the vacuum
electromagnetic environment to modify and to improve properties of materials.

double-helicity asymmetries ($5<p_T<12$ GeV/$c$) in polarized $p$$+$$p$
collisions at $\sqrt{s} = 200$ GeV. The cross section measurements are
consistent with perturbative calculations in quantum chromodynamics within
large uncertainties in the calculation due to the choice of factorization,
renormalization, and fragmentation scales. However, the theoretical calculation
of the ratio of $\pi^-$-to-$\pi^+$ production when considering these scale
uncertainties overestimates the measured value, suggesting further
investigation of the uncertainties on the charge-separated pion fragmentation
functions is needed. Due to cancellations of uncertainties in the charge ratio,
direct inclusion of these ratio data in future parameterizations should improve
constraints on the flavor dependence of quark fragmentation functions to pions.
By measuring charge-separated pion asymmetries, one can gain sensitivity to the
sign of $\Delta G$ through the opposite sign of the up and down quark helicity
distributions in conjunction with preferential fragmentation of positive pions
from up quarks and negative pions from down quarks. The double-helicity
asymmetries presented are sensitive to the gluon helicity distribution over an
$x$ range of $\sim$0.03--0.16.

Scientometrics. A number of efforts trying to cope with this task has been
discussed in the state of the art, addressing this challenge by processing
collections of scientific digital libraries and visualizing author-based
measures (for instance, the h-index) or document-based measures (for instance,
the averaged number of citations per document). A major drawback of these
approaches is related to the presence of bias. The bigger the country, the
higher the measure value. We explore the use of an econometric index to tackle
this limitation, known as the Revealed Comparative Advantage measure (RCA).
Using RCA, the diversity and ubiquity of each field of knowledge is mapped
across countries. Then, a RCA-based proximity function is explored to visualize
citation and h-index ubiquity. Science maps relating 27 knowledge areas and 237
countries are introduced using data crawled from Scimago that ranges from 1996
to 2011. Our results shows that the proposal is feasible and can be extended to
ellaborate a global scientific production characterization.

become insignificant at high temperatures. We find that, perhaps
counterintuitively, certain quantum effects may follow the opposite route and
become sharp when extrapolated to high temperature within a ""classical"" liquid
phase. In the current work, we suggest basic quantum bounds on relaxation (and
thermalization) times, examine kinetic theory by taking into account such
possible fundamental quantum time scales, find new general equalities
connecting semi-classical dynamics and thermodynamics to Planck's constant, and
compute current correlation functions. Our analysis suggests that, on average,
the extrapolated high temperature dynamical viscosity of general liquids may
tend to a value set by the product of the particle number density ${\sf n}$ and
Planck's constant $h$. We compare this theoretical result with experimental
measurements of an ensemble of 23 metallic fluids where this seems to indeed be
the case. The extrapolated high temperature viscosity of each of these liquids
$\eta$ divided (for each respective fluid by its value of ${\sf n} h$) veers
towards a Gaussian with an ensemble average value that is close to unity up to
an error of size $0.6 \%$. Inspired by the Eigenstate Thermalization
Hypothesis, we suggest a relation between the lowest equilibration temperature
to the melting or liquidus temperature and discuss a possible corollary
concerning the absence of finite temperature ""ideal glass"" transitions. We
suggest a general quantum mechanical derivation for the viscosity of glasses at
general temperatures. We invoke similar ideas to discuss other transport
properties and demonstrate how simple behaviors including resistivity
saturation and linear $T$ resistivity may appear very naturally. Our approach
suggests that minimal time lags may be present in fluid dynamics.

motivated several recent studies on making these systems more energy-
efficient. Occupancy and activity are two important aspects, which need to be
correctly estimated for optimal HVAC control. However, state-of-the-art methods
to estimate occupancy and classify activity require infrastructure and/or
wearable sensors which suffers from lower acceptability due to higher cost.
Encouragingly, with the advancement of the smartphones, these are becoming more
achievable. Most of the existing occupancy estimation tech- niques have the
underlying assumption that the phone is always carried by its user. However,
phones are often left at desk while attending meeting or other events, which
generates estimation error for the existing phone based occupancy algorithms.
Similarly, in the recent days the emerging theory of Sparse Random Classifier
(SRC) has been applied for activity classification on smartphone, however,
there are rooms to improve the on-phone process- ing. We propose a novel sensor
fusion method which offers almost 100% accuracy for occupancy estimation. We
also propose an activity classifica- tion algorithm, which offers similar

our simulations with a ray tracing method to compute the ionization state of
the gas. Galactic winds increase the HI covering fractions in galaxy halos by
direct ejection of cool gas from galaxies and through interactions with gas
inflowing from the intergalactic medium. Our simulations predict HI covering
fractions for Lyman limit systems (LLSs) consistent with measurements around
z~2-2.5 LBGs; these covering fractions are a factor ~2 higher than our previous
calculations without galactic winds. The fractions of HI absorbers arising in
inflows and in outflows are on average ~50% but exhibit significant time
variability, ranging from ~10% to ~90%. For our most massive halos, we find a
factor ~3 deficit in the LLS covering fraction relative to what is measured
around quasars at z~2, suggesting that the presence of a quasar may affect the
properties of halo gas on ~100 kpc scales. The predicted covering fractions,
which decrease with time, peak at M_h~10^11-10^12 Msun, near the peak of the
star formation efficiency in dark matter halos. In our simulations, star

$\Delta\alpha/\alpha$, in 3 absorption systems at redshifts

only at radii where the effects of central black holes may be significant. Dark
matter density slopes shallower than $\gamma=1.0$ occur for $r/r_{200} <

earlier suggestions that NFW-like profiles are an attractor for the

source number density is not too low, the sources should be numerous enough to
imprint a clustering pattern in the sky, and thus possibly in the UHECR arrival
directions. Under these limits, the anisotropy signal should be dominated by
the clustering of astrophysical sources per-se in the large-scale structures,
and not the clustering of events around individual sources. We study the
potential for a statistical discrimination between different astrophysical
models which we parametrise by the number density of UHECR sources, the
possible bias of the UHECR accelerators with respect to the galaxy
distribution, and the unknown fraction of UHECRs that have been deflected by
large angles. We demonstrate that an order-of-magnitude increase in statistics
would allow to discriminate between a variety of astrophysical models, provided
that a sub-sample of light elements can be extracted, and that it represents at
least ~70% of the overall flux, sensitive to the UHECR source number density.
Even without knowledge of the composition, an anisotropy at the 99.7% level
should be detectable when the number of detected events exceeds 2000 beyond 50
EeV, as long as the composition is proton dominated, and the number density of
UHECR sources is relatively high. If the UHECR sources are strongly biased
relative to the galaxy distribution, as are for example galaxy clusters, an
anisotropy at the 99.7% should be detectable once the number of detected events
exceeds 1000, if the fraction of protons at the highest energies is ~60% or
higher.

a qualified yes, as is the case with all of radiation therapy. But, neutron
therapy has not kept pace with the rest of radiation therapy in terms of beam
delivery techniques. Modern photon and proton based external beam radiotherapy
routinely implements image-guidance, beam intensity-modulation and
3-dimensional treatment planning. The current iteration of fast neutron
radiotherapy does not. Addressing these deficiencies, however, is not a matter
of technology or understanding, but resources. The future of neutron therapy
lies in better understanding the interaction processes of radiation with living
tissue. A combination of radiobiology and computer simulations is required in
order to optimize the use of neutron therapy. The questions that need to be
answered are: Can we connect the macroscopic with the microscopic? What is the
optimum energy? What is the optimum energy spectrum? Can we map the sensitivity
of the various tissues of the human body and use that knowledge to our
advantage? And once we gain a better understanding of the above radiobiological
issues will we be able to capitalize on this understanding by precisely and
accurately delivering fast neutrons in a manner comparable to what is now
possible with photons and protons? This presentation will review the
accomplishments to date. It will then lay out the questions that need to be

Calabi-Yau manifold with all moduli stabilised. Depending on the moduli
dependence of the Kaehler metric for matter fields and on the mechanism
responsible to obtain a de Sitter vacuum, we find two scenarios for
phenomenology: (i) a split-supersymmetry scenario where gaugino masses are
suppressed with respect to scalar masses: $M_{1/2} \sim m_{3/2} \epsilon \ll
m_0 \sim m_{3/2} \sqrt{\epsilon} \ll m_{3/2}$ for $\epsilon \sim m_{3/2}/M_P

perturbation theory in the coupling, we calculate $\tilde F$ in the
Wilson-Fisher fixed point of the $O(N)$ vector model in $d=4-\epsilon$ to order
$\epsilon^4$. We use this result to estimate the value of $F$ in the

  We have measured the core/halo using a 177MeV test beam offset in a water
tank. The beam monitor was a fluence calibrated plane parallel ionization
chamber (IC) and the field chamber, a dose calibrated Exradin T1, so the dose
measurements are absolute (MeV/g/p). We performed depth-dose scans at ten
displacements from the beam axis ranging from 0 to 10cm. The dose spans five
orders of magnitude, and the transition from halo to aura is clearly visible.
  We have performed model-dependent (MD) and model-independent (MI) fits to the
data. The MD fit separates the dose into core, elastic/inelastic nuclear,
nonelastic nuclear and aura terms, and achieves a global rms measurement/fit
ratio of 15%. The MI fit uses cubic splines and the same ratio is 9%.
  We review the literature, in particular the use of Pedroni's parametrization
of the core/halo. Several papers improve on his Gaussian transverse
distribution of the halo, but all retain his T(w), the radial integral of the
depth-dose multiplying both the core and halo terms and motivating measurements
with large ""Bragg peak chambers"" (BPCs).
  We argue that this use of T(w), which by its definition includes energy
deposition by nuclear secondaries, is incorrect. T(w) should be replaced in the
core term, and in at least part of the halo, by a purely electromagnetic mass
stopping power. BPC measurements are unnecessary, and irrelevant to
parameterizing the pencil beam.

the distribution of the photospheric field and the TSI starting from 1878. We
first calculate the magnetic flux on the solar surface emerging in active and
ephemeral regions. The evolution of the magnetic flux in active regions is
computed using a surface flux transport model fed with the observed record of
sunspot group areas and positions. The magnetic flux in ephemeral regions is
treated separately using the concept of overlapping cycles. To model the
ephemeral region cycles, we assume that their length and amplitude are related
to that of the sunspot cycles. We then use a version of the SATIRE model to
compute the TSI. The area coverage and the distribution of different magnetic
features as a function of time, which are required by SATIRE, are extracted
from the simulated magnetograms and the modelled ephemeral region magnetic
flux. Previously computed intensity spectra of the various types of magnetic
features are employed. Our model reproduces the PMOD composite of TSI
measurements starting from 1978 at daily and rotational timescales more
accurately than the previous version of the SATIRE model computing TSI over
this period of time. The simulated magnetograms provide a more realistic
representation of the evolution of the magnetic field on the photosphere and
also allow us to make use of information on the spatial distribution of the
magnetic fields before the times when observed magnetograms were available. We
find that the secular increase in TSI since 1878 is fairly stable to
modifications of the treatment of the ephemeral region magnetic flux.

evolution between Drosophila species. At the same time, the Drosophila genome
evolves under different rates of recombination, which results in partial
genetic linkage between alleles at neighboring genomic loci. Here we analyze
how linkage correlations affect adaptive evolution. We develop a new inference
method for adaptation that takes into account the effect on an allele at a
focal site caused by neighboring deleterious alleles (background selection) and
by neighboring adaptive substitutions (hitchhiking). Using complete genome
sequence data and fine-scale recombination maps, we infer a highly
heterogeneous scenario of adaptation in Drosophila. In high-recombining
regions, about 50% of all amino acid substitutions are adaptive, together with
about 20% of all substitutions in proximal intergenic regions. In
low-recombining regions, only a small fraction of the amino acid substitutions
are adaptive, while hitchhiking accounts for the majority of these changes.
Hitchhiking of deleterious alleles generates a substantial collateral cost of
adaptation, leading to a fitness decline of about 30/2N per gene and per
million years in the lowest-recombining regions. Our results show how
recombination shapes rate and efficacy of the adaptive dynamics in eukaryotic
genomes.

space of $M_{BH}\sim10^8 M_\odot$ and $M_{host}\sim10^{11} M_\odot$ at z $<$

relation for a sample of 37 quasars with low black hole masses ($10^7 M_\odot <
M_{BH} < 10^{8.3} M_\odot$) at 0.5 $<$ z $<$ 1.0. The black hole masses were
derived using virial mass estimates from SDSS optical spectra. For 25 quasars,
we detected the presence of the host galaxy from deep near-infrared H-band
imaging, whereas upper limits for the host galaxy luminosity (mass) were
estimated for the 12 unresolved quasars. We combined our previous studies with
the results from this work to create a sample of 89 quasars at z $<$ 1.0 having
a large range of black hole masses ($10^7 M_\odot < M_{BH} < 10^{10} M_\odot$)
and host galaxy masses ($10^{10} M_\odot < M_{host} < 10^{13} M_\odot$). Most
of the quasars at the low mass end lie below the extrapolation of the local
relation. This apparent break in the linearity of the entire sample is due to
increasing fraction of disc-dominated host galaxies in the low-mass quasars.
After correcting for the disc component, and considering only the bulge
component, the bilinear regression for the entire quasar sample holds over 3.5
dex in both the black hole mass and the bulge mass, and is in very good
agreement with the local relation. We advocate secular evolution of discs of
galaxies being responsible for the relatively strong disc domination.

geostrophically balanced for all stratification levels investigated and the
classical (i.e., incompressible) asymptotic scaling laws for the critical
parameters are recovered. For sufficiently small Prandtl numbers, increasing
stratification tends to further destabilise the fluid layer, decrease the
critical wavenumber and increase the oscillation frequency of the convective
instability. In combination, these effects increase the relative magnitude of
the time derivative of the density perturbation contained in the conservation
of mass equation to non-negligible levels; the resulting convective
instabilities occur in the form of compressional quasi-geostrophic
oscillations. We find that the anelastic equations, which neglect this term,
cannot capture these instabilities and possess spuriously-growing eigenmodes in
the rapidly rotating, low Prandtl number regime. It is shown that the Mach
number for rapidly rotating compressible convection is intrinsically small for
all background states, regardless of the departure from adiabaticity.

Following compression, spectral enhancements extend even into the visible

transition radiation (OTR) screens have been extensively used for transverse
electron beam size measurements for the bright beams, but the presence of such
longitudinal microstructures (microbunching) in the electron beam or the
leading edge spikes can result in strong, localized coherent enhancements
(COTR) that mask the actual beam profile. Generally, we have observed effects
in rf photocathode (PC) injected linacs with chicane compressions since an R56
term is needed. In the past COTR had been only reported in S-band and L-band
photoinjected based linacs with single or double bunch compression. Drive laser
modulations and charge shot noise have been suspected of contributing to the

QCD studies of nuclear and hadronic systems. Among these developments are i) an
analytical investigation of the recovery of rotational symmetry with the use of
suitably-formed smeared operators toward the continuum limit, ii) an extension
of the Luscher finite-volume method to two-nucleon systems with arbitrary
angular momentum, spin, parity and center of mass momentum, iii) the
application of such formalism in extracting the scattering parameters of the
3S1-3D1 coupled channels, iv) an investigation of twisted boundary conditions
in the single- and two-hadron sectors, with proposals for improving the
volume-dependence of the deuteron binding energy upon proper choices of
boundary conditions, and v) exploring the volume dependence of the masses of
hadrons and light-nuclei due to quantum electrodynamic interactions, including
the effects arising from particles' compositeness. The required background as
well as a brief status report of the field pertinent to the discussions in this
thesis are presented.

establish a tight link between two seemingly different algorithms and prove
that Elastic Net regression can be reduced to SVM with squared hinge loss

speeding up and parallelizing SVMs to obtain a highly optimized and parallel

provide a principled way to identify potentially faulty statements together
with information that can help fix such statements. Although effective, these
approaches are computationally expensive, which limits their practical
applicability. Moreover, they tend to focus on failing test cases alone, thus
ignoring the wealth of information provided by passing tests. To mitigate these
issues, we propose two techniques: on-demand formula computation (OFC) and
clause weighting (CW). OFC improves the overall efficiency of formula-based
debugging by exploring all and only the parts of a program that are relevant to
a failure. CW improves the accuracy of formula-based debugging by leveraging
statistical fault-localization information that accounts for passing tests. Our
empirical results show that both techniques are effective and can improve the
state of the art in formula-based debugging.

These electrons are mostly scattered at the small angles to the direction of
propagation of the electromagnetic wave. The maximum Lorentz factor of the
electrons crossed the electromagnetic wave is proportional to the work done by
the electromagnetic field and is independent of the initial momenta. The
momentum component parallel to the electric field strength vector of the

has a risk-limiting capability. If a principal and an agent enter into such a
contract, the principal can optimally manage its performance and risk with a
guarantee that the agent's risk is less than or equal to a pre-specified level
and that the agent's expected payoff is greater than or equal to another
pre-specified threshold. We achieve such risk-management capabilities by
formulating the contract design problem as mean-variance constrained
risk-sensitive control. A dynamic programming-based method is developed to
solve the problem. The key idea of our proposed solution method is to
reformulate the inequality constraints on the mean and the variance of the
agent's payoff as dynamical system constraints by introducing new state and
control variables. The reformulations use the martingale representation
theorem. The proposed contract method enables us to develop a new direct load
control method that provides the load-serving entity with financial risk
management solutions in real-time electricity markets. We also propose an
approximate decomposition of the optimal contract design problem for multiple
customers into multiple low-dimensional contract problems for one customer.
This allows the direct load control program to work with a large number of
customers without any scalability issues. Furthermore, the contract design
procedure can be completely parallelized. The performance and usefulness of the
proposed contract method and its application to direct load control are
demonstrated using data on the electric energy consumption of customers in
Austin, Texas as well as the Electricity Reliability Council of Texas'
locational marginal price data.

environmental flows. While many previous studies investigate their rheological
properties in laminar flows, little is known on the behaviour of these
suspensions in the turbulent/inertial regime. The present study aims to fill
this gap by investigating the turbulent flow of a Newtonian fluid laden with
solid neutrally-buoyant spheres at relatively high volume fractions in a plane
channel. Direct Numerical Simulation are performed in the range of volume
fractions Phi=0-0.2 with an Immersed Boundary Method used to account for the
dispersed phase. The results show that the mean velocity profiles are
significantly altered by the presence of a solid phase with a decrease of the
von Karman constant in the log-law. The overall drag is found to increase with
the volume fraction, more than one would expect just considering the increase
of the system viscosity due to the presence of the particles. At the highest
volume fraction here investigated, Phi=0.2, the velocity fluctuation
intensities and the Reynolds shear stress are found to decrease. The analysis
of the mean momentum balance shows that the particle-induced stresses govern
the dynamics at high Phi and are the main responsible of the overall drag
increase. In the dense limit, we therefore find a decrease of the turbulence
activity and a growth of the particle induced stress, where the latter
dominates for the Reynolds numbers considered here.

mechanics of materials and structures including the theories of composites,
fracture, and plasticity. However, it does not include the effects of surface
stress, which has recently been shown to control many processes in soft
materials such as gels, elastomers and biological tissue. To extend Eshelby's
theory of inclusions to soft materials, we consider liquid inclusions within an
isotropic, compressible, linear-elastic solid. We solve for the displacement
and stress fields around individual stretched inclusions, accounting for the
bulk elasticity of the solid and the surface tension (\textit{i.e.} isotropic
strain-independent surface stress) of the solid-liquid interface. Surface
tension significantly alters the inclusion's shape and stiffness as well as its
near- and far-field stress fields. These phenomenon depend strongly on the
ratio of inclusion radius, $R$, to an elastocapillary length, $L$. Surface
tension is significant whenever inclusions are smaller than $100L$. While
Eshelby theory predicts that liquid inclusions generically reduce the stiffness
of an elastic solid, our results show that liquid inclusions can actually
stiffen a solid when $R<3L/2$. Intriguingly, surface tension cloaks the
far-field signature of liquid inclusions when $R=3L/2$. These results are have
far-reaching applications from measuring local stresses in biological tissue,
to determining the failure strength of soft composites.

  The spectra of PWNe range from radio to $\gamma$-rays. They are the largest
class of identified Galactic sources in $\gamma$-rays increasing the number
from 1 to $\sim$30 during the last years. We have developed a detailed spectral
code which reproduces the electromagnetic spectrum of PWNe in free expansion

evolution of the spectra, the synchrotron self-Compton dominance in the Crab
Nebula, the particle dominance in PWNe detected at TeV energies and how
physical parameters constrain the detectability of PWNe at TeV. We make a
systematic study of all Galactic, TeV-detected, young PWNe which allows to find
correlations and trends between parameters. We also discuss about the spectrum
of those PWNe not detected at TeV and if models with low magnetized nebulae can
explain the lack of detection or, on the contrary, high-magnetization models
are more favorable.

magnetars to discuss about the formation mechanism of such extremely magnetized
PSRs. The alpha-dynamo mechanism proposed in the 1990's produces an energy
release that should have influence in the energy of the SN explosion. We extend

by an energetic parton propagating through a dense QCD medium. We focus on the
high-energy regime where the energy $E$ of the leading particle is much larger
than the characteristic medium scale $\omega_c=\hat q L^2/2$, with $\hat q$ the
jet quenching parameter and $L$ the distance travelled through the medium. In
this regime the leading particle loses only a small fraction
$\sim\alpha_s(\omega_c/E)$ of its energy and can be treated as a steady source
of radiation for gluons with energies $\omega\le\omega_c$. For this effective
problem with a source, we obtain exact analytic solutions for the gluon
spectrum and the energy flux. The solutions exhibit wave turbulence: the basic
physical process is a continuing fragmentation which is `quasi-democratic'
(i.e. quasi-local in energy) and which provides an energy transfer from the
source to the medium at a rate (the energy flux $\mathcal{F}$) which is
quasi-independent of $\omega$. The locality of the branching process implies a
spectrum of the Kolmogorov-Obukhov type, i.e. a power-law spectrum which is a
fixed point of the branching process and whose strength is proportional to the
energy flux: $D(\omega)\sim\mathcal{F}/\sqrt\omega$ for $\omega\ll\omega_c$.
Via this turbulent flow, the gluon cascade loses towards the medium an energy
$\Delta E\sim\alpha_s^2\omega_c$, which is independent of the initial energy
$E$ of the leading particle and of the details of the thermalization mechanism
at the low-energy end of the cascade. This energy is carried away by very soft
gluons, which propagate at very large angles with respect to the jet axis. Our
predictions for the value of $\Delta E$ and for its angular distribution appear
to agree quite well, qualitatively and even semi-quantitatively, with the
phenomenology of di-jet asymmetry in nucleus-nucleus collisions at the LHC.

as for evidence of ultra-fast outflow signatures. The Chandra HETGS X-ray
spectrum of Mrk 509 was analysed using the SPEX fitting package. We confirm the
basic structure of the warm absorber found in the 600 ks XMM-Newton RGS
observation observed three years earlier, consisting of five distinct
ionisation components in a multikinematic regime. We find little or no
variability in the physical properties of the different warm absorber phases
with respect to previous observations in this campaign, except for component D2
which has a higher column density at the expense of component C2 at the same
outflow velocity (-240 km/s). Contrary to prior reports we find no -700 km/s
outflow component. The O VIII absorption line profiles show an average covering
factor of 0.81 +/- 0.08 for outflow velocities faster than -100 km/s, similar
to those measured in the UV. This supports the idea of a patchy wind. The
relative metal abundances in the outflow are close to proto-solar. The narrow
component of the Fe Kalpha emission line shows no changes with respect to
previous observations which confirms its origin in distant matter. The narrow
line has a red wing that can be interpreted to be a weak relativistic emission
line. We find no significant evidence of ultra-fast outflows in our new
spectrum down to the sensitivity limit of our data.

Eulerian coordinates embedded into the Lagrangian frame; (b) from performing a
specific gauge transformation; and (c) from a fully non-perturbative approach
based on the ADM split. The latter approach shows that this decomposition is
not tied to a specific perturbative formulation for the solution of the
Einstein equations. Rather, it can be defined at the level of the
non-perturbative coordinate change from the Lagrangian to the Eulerian
description. Studying such different techniques is useful because it allows us
to compare and develop further the various approximation techniques available
in the Lagrangian formulation. We find that one has to solve the gravitational
wave equation in the relativistic analysis, otherwise the corresponding
Newtonian limit will necessarily contain spurious non-propagating tensor
artefacts at second order in the Eulerian frame. We also derive the magnetic
part of the Weyl tensor in the Lagrangian frame, and find that it is not only
excited by gravitational waves but also by tensor perturbations which are
induced through the non-linear frame-dragging. We apply our findings to
calculate for the first time the relativistic displacement field, up to second

indirect vector control of induction motor. In this proposed scheme a Neutral
Point Clamped (NPC) multilevel inverter is used and hysteresis current control
technique has been adopted for switching the IGBTs. A Mamdani type fuzzy
controller is used in place of conventional PI controller. To ensure better
performance of fuzzy controller all parameters such as membership functions,
normalizing and de-normalizing parameters are optimized using PSO. The
performance of proposed controller is investigated under various load and speed
conditions. The simulation results show its stability and robustness for high
performance derives applications.

build an appropriate mathematical or stochastic model to describe the data so
that further studies can be done with the help of the models. In this article,
the input-output type mechanism is considered first, where reaction, diffusion,
reaction-diffusion, and production-destruction type physical situations can fit
in. Then techniques are described to produce thicker or thinner tails (power
law behavior) in stochastic models. Then the pathway idea is described where
one can switch to different functional forms of the probability density
function) through a parameter called the pathway parameter.

  internal mass attached by multiple axisymmetrically distributed stiffeners","22 pages, 8 figures",,"10.1016/j.jsv.2014.10.039",,"physics.class-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A thin infinitely long elastic shell is stiffened by $J$ in number identical
lengthwise ribs distributed uniformly around the circumference and joined to a
rod in the center. The 2D model of the substructure is a rigid central mass
supported by $J$ axisymmetrically placed linear springs. The response of the
shell-spring-mass system is quite different from a fluid filled shell or that
of a solid cylinder due to the discrete number of contact points which couple
the displacement of the shell at different locations. Exterior acoustic
scattering due to normal plane wave incidence is solved in closed form for
arbitrary $J$. The scattering matrix associated with the normal mode solution
displays a simple structure, composed of distinct sub-matrices which decouple
the incident and scattered fields into $J$ families. The presence of a
springs-mass substructure causes resonances which are shown to be related to
the subsonic shell flexural waves, and an approximate analytic expression is
derived for the quasi-flexural resonance frequencies. Numerical simulations
indicate that the new solution for $J\ge 3$ springs results in a complicated
scattering response for plane wave incidence. As the number of springs becomes
large enough, the total scattering cross-section is asymptotically zero at low
frequencies and slightly increased compared to the empty shell at moderate
frequencies due to the added stiffness and mass. It is also observed that the
sensitivity to the angle of incidence diminishes as the number of springs is
increased. This system can be tuned by selecting the shell thickness, spring
stiffness and added mass to yield desired quasi-static effective properties
making it a candidate element for graded index sonic crystals.
