applied to the explanation of the concomitance of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) with
supernovae (SNe) Ic. The progenitor is a tight binary system composed by a
carbon-oxygen (CO) core and a neutron star (NS) companion. The explosion of the
SN leads to hypercritical accretion onto the NS companion which reaches the
critical mass, hence inducing its gravitational collapse to a black hole (BH)
with consequent emission of the GRB. The first estimates of this process were
based on a simplified model of the binary parameters and the
Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton accretion rate. We present here the first full numerical
simulations of the IGC phenomenon. We simulate the core-collapse and SN
explosion of CO stars to obtain the density and ejection velocity of the SN
ejecta. We follow the hydrodynamic evolution of the accreting material falling
into the Bondi-Hoyle surface of the NS all the way up to its incorporation to
the NS surface. The simulations go up to BH formation when the NS reaches the
critical mass. For appropriate binary parameters the IGC occurs in short
timescales (100-1000s) owing to the combined effective action of the photon
trapping and the neutrino cooling near the NS surface. We also show that the
IGC scenario leads to a natural explanation for why GRBs are associated only to
SN Ic with totally absent or very little helium.

considered intractable due to the curse of dimensionality. Recently, Goldberg

asymptotically optimal. However, the bounds proven there require the lead time
to be very large before the constant-order policy becomes effective, in
contrast to the good numerical performance demonstrated by Zipkin even for
small lead time values. In this work, we prove that for the infinite-horizon

constant-order policy actually converges \emph{exponentially fast} to zero,
with the optimality gap decaying to zero at least as fast as the exponential

nature. In fact, the prevalent theoretical view is that these are indeed the
real objects behind the curtain in astrophysical scenarios. There are several
proposals for regularizing the classical singularity of black holes so that
their formation and evaporation do not lead to information-loss problems. One
characteristic is shared by most of these proposals: these regularly
evaporating black holes present long-lived trapping horizons, with absolutely
enormous evaporation lifetimes in whatever measure. Guided by the discomfort
with these enormous and thus inaccessible lifetimes, we elaborate here on an
alternative regularization of the classical singularity, previously proposed by
the authors in an emergent gravity framework, which leads to a completely
different scenario. In our scheme the collapse of a stellar object would result
in a genuine time-symmetric bounce, which in geometrical terms amounts to the
connection of a black-hole geometry with a white-hole geometry in a regular
manner. The two most differential characteristics of this proposal are: i) the
complete bouncing geometry is a solution of standard classical general
relativity everywhere except in a transient region that necessarily extends
beyond the gravitational radius associated with the total mass of the
collapsing object; and ii) the duration of the bounce as seen by external
observers is very brief (fractions of milliseconds for neutron-star-like
collapses). This scenario motivates the search for new forms of stellar
equilibrium different from black holes. In a brief epilogue we compare our
proposal with a similar geometrical setting recently proposed by Haggard and
Rovelli.

exactly solvable models with $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological order in two
dimensions. In particular, we have obtained a complete understanding of which
distinct types of symmetry fractionalization (symmetry classes) can be realized
within this class of models, which are generalizations of Kitaev's
$\mathbb{Z}_2$ toric code to arbitrary lattices. This question is motivated by
earlier work of A. M. Essin and one of us (M. H.), where the idea of symmetry
classification was laid out, and which, for square lattice symmetry, produces
2080 symmetry classes consistent with the fusion rules of $\mathbb{Z}_2$
topological order. This approach does not produce a physical model for each
symmetry class, and indeed there are reasons to believe that some symmetry
classes may not be realizable in strictly two-dimensional systems, thus raising
the question of which classes are in fact possible. While our understanding is
limited to a restricted class of models, it is complete in the sense that for
each of the 2080 possible symmetry classes, we either prove rigorously that the
class cannot be realized in our family of models, or we give an explicit model
realizing the class. We thus find that exactly 487 symmetry classes are
realized in the family of models considered. With a more restrictive type of
symmetry action, where space group operations act trivially in the internal
Hilbert space of each spin degree of freedom, we find that exactly 82 symmetry
classes are realized. In addition, we present a single model that realizes all
$2^6 = 64$ types of symmetry fractionalization allowed for a single anyon
species ($\mathbb{Z}_2$ charge excitation), as the parameters in the
Hamiltonian are varied. The paper concludes with a summary and a discussion of
two results pertaining to more general bosonic models.

The topological profile of the zero-mode ground state, $\psi_{0}$, and the
first excited state, $\psi_{1}$, of DW potentials is obtained through the
analytical technique of topological defect deformation. Deformed defects create
two inequivalent topological scenarios connected by a symmetry breaking that

of two-level models where a non-stationary quantum state of unitary evolution,
$\psi_{0} + e^{\mbox{$-i E \,t$}}\psi_{1}$, that exhibits a stable tunneling
dynamics, is converted into a quantum superposition involving a self-vanishing
tachyonic mode, $e^{\mbox{$- E \,t$}}\psi_{0} + \psi_{1}$, that parameterizes a

For these packets, it is inefficient to follow the conventional medium access
control protocols because of poor utilization of service resources. We propose
a novel multiple access scheme that employs block-spreading based precoding at
the transmitters and sparsity-aware detection schemes at the base station. The
proposed scheme is well suited for the emerging massive multiple-input
multiple-output (MIMO) systems, as well as conventional cellular systems with a
small number of base-station antennas. The transmitters employ precoding in
time domain to enable the simultaneous transmissions of many users, which could
be even more than the number of receive antennas at the base station. The
system is modeled as a linear system of equations with block-sparse unknowns.
We first adopt the block orthogonal matching pursuit (BOMP) algorithm to
recover the transmitted signals. We then develop an improved algorithm, named
interference cancellation BOMP (ICBOMP), which takes advantage of error
correction and detection coding to perform perfect interference cancellation
during each iteration of BOMP algorithm. Conditions for guaranteed data
recovery are identified. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed
scheme can accommodate more simultaneous transmissions than conventional
schemes in typical small-packet transmission scenarios.

matter and dark energy. We discuss how current observations addressed some of

prohibited ground access using a wireless sensor network, one approach is to
deploy the sensors remotely, from an aircraft. In this approach, the lack of
precise sensor placement is compensated by redundant de-ployment of sensor
nodes. This redundancy can also be used for extending the lifetime of the
network, if a proper scheduling mechanism is available for scheduling the
active and sleep times of sensor nodes in such a way that each node is in
active mode only if it is required to. In this pa-per, we propose an efficient
scheduling method based on learning automata and we called it LAML, in which
each node is equipped with a learning automaton, which helps the node to select
its proper state (active or sleep), at any given time. To study the performance
of the proposed method, computer simulations are conducted. Results of these
simulations show that the pro-posed scheduling method can better prolong the
lifetime of the network in comparison to similar existing method.

accompanied by a drastic increase of the scattering rate. Remarkably, all

material undergoes a dimensional crossover along the Fermi surface, between the
nodal (2D) and antinodal (3D) regions. In LSCO, this crossover accounts for FS
arcs, the antinodal pseudogap, and insulating behavior in $c$-axis
conductivity, all ubiquitous phenomena in high-T$_c$ cuprates. Ligand Coulomb

studied in terms of their reconstructed attractors. Reconstructed attractors of
a continuous signal are meant to be topologically equivalent representations of
the dynamics of the unknown dynamical system which generates the signal.
Sometimes, geometry of the attractor or its complexity may give important
information on the system of interest. However, if the trajectories of the
attractor behave as if they are not coming from continuous system or there
exists many spike like structures on the path of the system trajectories, then
there is no way to characterize the shape of the attractor. In this article,
the traditional attractor reconstruction method is first used for two types of
ECG signals: Normal healthy persons (NHP) and Congestive Heart failure patients
(CHFP). As common in such a framework, the reconstructed attractors are not at
all well formed and hence it is not possible to adequately characterize their
geometrical features. Thus, we incorporate frequency domain information to the
given time signals. This is done by transforming the signals to a time
frequency domain by means of suitable Wavelet transforms (WT). The transformed
signal concerns two non homogeneous variables and is still quite difficult to
use to reconstruct some dynamics out of it. By applying a suitable mapping,
this signal is further converted into integer domain and a new type of 3D plot,
called integer lag plot, which characterizes and distinguishes the ECG signals
of NHP and CHFP, is finally obtained.

extended to include functors from an unbased simplicial model category to

exists a discrete calculus tower for functors from an unbased simplicial model
category to chain complexes over a fixed commutative ring. Much of the
construction of the Taylor tower for functors to spectra carries over to this
context. However, one of the essential steps in the construction requires
proving that a particular functor is part of a cotriple. For this, one needs to
prove that certain identities involving homotopy limits hold up to isomorphism,
rather than just up to weak equivalence. As the target category of chain
complexes is not a simplicial model category, the arguments for functors to
spectra need to be adjusted for chain complexes. In this paper, we take
advantage of the fact that we can construct an explicit model for iterated
fibers, and prove that the functor is a cotriple directly. We use related ideas
to provide concrete infinite deloopings of the first terms in the resulting
Taylor towers when evaluated at the initial object in the source category.

limited incentives are at disposal for rewarding cooperators and punishing
defectors. In the simplest case, it can be assumed that, depending on their
strategies, all players receive equal incentives from the common pool. The
question arises, however, what is the optimal distribution of institutional
incentives? How should we best reward and punish individuals for cooperation to
thrive? We study this problem for the public goods game on a scale-free
network. We show that if the synergetic effects of group interactions are weak,
the level of cooperation in the population can be maximized simply by adopting
the simplest ""equal distribution"" scheme. If synergetic effects are strong,
however, it is best to reward high-degree nodes more than low-degree nodes.
These distribution schemes for institutional rewards are independent of payoff
normalization. For institutional punishment, however, the same optimization
problem is more complex, and its solution depends on whether absolute or
degree-normalized payoffs are used. We find that degree-normalized payoffs
require high-degree nodes be punished more lenient than low-degree nodes.
Conversely, if absolute payoffs count, then high-degree nodes should be
punished stronger than low-degree nodes.

that the form of efficiency probability distributions is similar to those
described by Verley et al. [2014 Nat Comm, 5 4721], in particular featuring a
local minimum in the long-time limit. In contrast to the time-symmetric engine
protocols studied previously, however, this minimum need not occur at the value
characteristic of a reversible Carnot engine. Furthermore, while the local
minimum may reside at the global minimum of a large deviation rate function, it
does not generally correspond to the least likely efficiency measured over
finite time. We introduce a general approximation for the finite-time

related by the disformal transformation. The gravity and matter frames are the
extensions of the Einstein and Jordan frames in the scalar-tensor theory where
two frames are related by the conformal transformation, respectively. First, it
is shown that the curvature perturbation in the comoving gauge to the scalar
field is disformally invariant as well as conformally invariant, which gives
the predictions from the cosmological model where the scalar field is
responsible both for inflation and cosmological perturbations. Second, in case
that the disformally coupled matter sector also contributes to curvature
perturbations, we derive the evolution equations of the curvature perturbation
in the uniform matter energy density gauge from the energy (non)conservation in
the matter sector, which are independent of the choice of the gravity sector.
While in the matter frame the curvature perturbation in the uniform matter
energy density gauge is conserved on superhorizon scales for the vanishing
nonadiabatic pressure, in the gravity frame it is not conserved even if the
nonadiabatic pressure vanishes. The formula relating two frames gives the
amplitude of the curvature perturbation in the matter frame, once it is

population of dwarf spheroidal galaxies and used this information to set
constraints on the dark matter annihilation cross section. Interestingly, their
analysis uncovered an excess with a test statistic (TS) of 8.7. If interpreted
naively, this constitutes a 2.95 sigma local excess (p-value=0.003), relative
to the expectations of their background model. In order to further test this
interpretation, the Fermi-LAT team studied a large number of blank sky
locations and found TS>8.7 excesses to be more common than predicted by their
background model, decreasing the significance of their dwarf excess to 2.2
sigma (p-value=0.027). We argue that these TS>8.7 blank sky locations are
largely the result of unresolved blazars, radio galaxies, and starforming
galaxies, and show that multi-wavelength information can be used to reduce the
degree to which such sources contaminate the otherwise blank sky. In
particular, we show that masking regions of the sky that lie within 1 degree of
sources contained in the BZCAT or CRATES catalogs reduces the fraction of blank
sky locations with TS>8.7 by more than a factor of two. Taking such
multi-wavelength information into account can enable experiments such as Fermi
to better characterize their backgrounds and increase their sensitivity to dark
matter in dwarf galaxies, the most important of which remain largely
uncontaminated by unresolved point sources. We also note that for the range of
dark matter masses and annihilation cross sections currently being tested by
studies of dwarf spheroidal galaxies, simulations predict that Fermi should be
able to detect a significant number of dark matter subhalos. These subhalos
constitute a population of sub-threshold gamma-ray point sources and represent

We find that the data selects a particular region of the parameter space with a

the predictions for various observables within this parameter space, and find
that searches for this light CP-odd state at the LHC, as well as searches for

time and from first principles the Boltzmann hierarchy for neutrinos including
interactions with a scalar particle. Such interactions appear, for example, in
majoron-like models of neutrino mass generation. We study two limits of the
scalar mass: (i) An extremely massive scalar whose only role is to mediate an
effective 4-fermion neutrino-neutrino interaction, and (ii) a massless scalar
that can be produced in abundance and thus demands its own Boltzmann hierarchy.
In contrast to, e.g., the first-order Boltzmann hierarchy for
Thomson-scattering photons, our interacting neutrino/scalar Boltzmann
hierarchies contain additional momentum-dependent collision terms arising from
a non-negligible energy transfer in the neutrino-neutrino and neutrino-scalar
interactions. This necessitates that we track each momentum mode of the phase
space distributions individually, even if the particles were massless.
Comparing our hierarchy with the commonly used $(c_{\rm eff}^2,c_{\rm
vis}^2)$-parameterisation, we find no formal correspondence between the two
approaches, which raises the question of whether the latter parameterisation
even has an interpretation in terms of particle scattering. Lastly, although we
have invoked majoron-like models as a motivation for our study, our treatment
is in fact generally applicable to all scenarios in which the neutrino and/or
other ultrarelativistic fermions interact with scalar particles.

the large tangential shear of the cluster with a local secondary deflection by
the member galaxy out to a limiting radius of about 18 kpc. The lensing
lenticular galaxy is also well resolved and evidently lies nearly edge-on in
projection. This fortuitous combination of a long arc intersecting an edge on
galaxy provides us with an opportunity to place relatively strong constraints
on the lensing effect of this galaxy. We can model the stellar lensing
contribution using the observed pixels belonging to the galaxy, in 2D, and we
add to this a standard parameterised dark halo component. Irrespective of the
detailed choice of parameters we obtain a combined total mass of about 3E11
Msun. Depending on the dark halo parameters, the stellar contribution to this
is limited to the range 5-15E10 Msun or 20-50 percent of the total mass, in
good agreement with the independent stellar mass computed from the photometry
of 5E10 Msun for a Chabrier IMF, or 8E10Msun for a Salpeter IMF. The major axis
of the DM halo is constrained to be nearly orthogonal to the plane of the
galaxy, within a range of about 15 degrees, and with an ellipticity e=015
corresponding to an axis ratio a/c=0.54. We show that these conclusions are
very weakly dependent on the model of the cluster, or the additional influence
of neighbouring galaxies or the properties of the lensed source. Alternative
theories of gravity where the radial dependence is modified to avoid the need
for DM are challenged by this finding since generically these must be tied to
the baryonic component which here is a stellar disk oriented nearly
orthogonally to the lensed image deflection.

Myr at $\sim145$ kpc into the downstream area, assuming a $0.6$ nT magnetic

with 9.3 < log10 M_*/M_sun < 10.7. These high-spatial-resolution zoom-in
calculations enable accurate modeling of the rest-frame UV and optical
morphology. Even with small numbers of galaxies, we find that structural
evolution is neither universal nor monotonic: galaxy interactions can trigger
either bulge or disc formation, and optically bulge-dominated galaxies at this
mass may not remain so forever. Simulated galaxies with M_* > 10^10 M_sun
contain relatively more disc-dominated light profiles than those with lower
mass, reflecting significant disc brightening in some haloes at 1 < z < 2. By
this epoch, simulated galaxies with specific star formation rates below 10^-9.7
yr^-1 are more likely than normal star-formers to have a broader mix of
structural types, especially at M_* > 10^10 M_sun. We analyze a cosmological
major merger at z ~ 1.5 and find that the newly proposed MID morphology
diagnostics trace later merger stages while G-M20 trace earlier ones. MID is
sensitive also to clumpy star-forming discs. The observability time of typical
MID-enhanced events in our simulation sample is less than 100 Myr. A larger
sample of cosmological assembly histories may be required to calibrate such
diagnostics in the face of their sensitivity to viewing angle, segmentation
algorithm, and various phenomena such as clumpy star formation and minor
mergers.

neutron star and it has to propagate through the rest of it to emerge into the
interstellar medium. An important issue is whether this propagation affects the
planes of polarization of the generated radiation. Observationally, there is a
sufficient evidence that the emerging radiation is polarized parallel or
perpendicular to the magnetic field line planes that should be associated with
the ordinary O and extraordinary X plasma modes respectively, excited by some
radiative process. This strongly suggests that the excited X- and O-modes are
not affected by the so-called Adiabatic Walking that causes a slow rotation of
polarization vectors. In this paper we demonstrate that the conditions for the
Adiabatic Walking are not fulfilled within the soliton model of pulsar radio
emission, in which the coherent curvature radiation occurs at frequencies much
lower than the characteristic plasma frequency. The X-mode propagates freely
and observationally represents the primary polarization mode. The O-mode has
difficulties in escaping from the pulsar plasma, nonetheless it is sporadically
observed as a weaker secondary polarization mode. We discuss a possible
scenario under which the O-mode can also escape from the plasma and reach an
observer.

explain galactic rotation curves without the need for dark matter, this
starting from the idea that when Einstein's equations are applied to the
dynamics of a galaxy embedded in an expanding universe they do not reduce to
Poisson's equation but a generalisation of it taking cosmological expansion
into account. A non-linear scheme to perturb Einstein's field equations around
the Robertson-Walker (R-W) metric is devised in order to find their
non-relativistic limit without losing their characteristic non-linearities. The
resulting equation is used to numerically study the gravitational potential of
a cosmological perturbation and applied to a simple galactic model with an
exponentially decreasing baryonic matter distribution. The non-relativistic
limit of GR in a R-W space-time produces a generalised Poisson equation for the
gravitational potential which is non-linear, parabolic and heat-like. It is
shown how its non-linearities generate an effective ""dark matter"" distribution
caused by both cosmological expansion and the dynamics of the perturbation's
gravitational potential. It is also shown how this dynamical effect gets
completely lost during a linearisation of Einstein's equations. The equation is
then used to successfully fit real galactic rotation curves numerically using a
matter distribution following the shape of a simple S\'ersic luminosity
profile, common to most galaxies, thus without recourse to dark matter. A
relation for the dark to luminous matter ratio is found, explaining the
domination of dark matter in low-mass galaxies. A few rotation curves with a
faster than Newtonian decrease are also presented and successfully fitted,
opening the way to a new possible interpretation of these phenomena in terms of
an effective ""anti-gravitational"" dark matter distribution, purely geometrical
in origin.

cosmic time, and incorporate the precipitation threshold into a comprehensive

gaseous atmospheres. Central galaxies with low-entropy, high-density
atmospheres frequently contain multiphase star-forming gas, while those with
high-entropy, low-density atmospheres never do. The dividing line between these
two populations in central entropy, and therefore central cooling time, is
amazingly sharp. Two hypotheses have been proposed to explain the dichotomy.
One points out that thermal conduction can prevent radiative cooling of cluster
cores above the dividing line. The other holds that cores below the dividing
line are subject to thermal instability that fuels the central AGN through a
cold-feedback mechanism. Here we explore those hypotheses with an analysis of
the H-alpha properties of ACCEPT galaxy clusters. We find that the two
hypotheses are likely to be complementary. Our results support a picture in
which cold clouds inevitably precipitate out of cluster cores in which cooling
outcompetes thermal conduction and rain down on the central black hole, causing
AGN feedback that stabilizes the cluster core. In particular, the observed
distribution of the cooling-time to freefall-time ratio is nearly identical to
that seen in simulations of this cold-feedback process, implying that
cold-phase accretion, and not Bondi-like accretion of hot-phase gas, is
responsible for the AGN feedback that regulates star formation in large

functions differ by O(exp(-aN)). The celebrated type IIB on AdS^5 x S^5 and
M-theory on AdS^4 x S^7 fall in this class and thus seem to also admit
non-unitary non-perturbative completions. It is tempting to conjecture that
this setup may provide a non-unitary model for black hole evaporation.

low-eccentricity, 240.5-day orbit about an eclipsing binary. The binary itself
consists of a 0.93 and 0.194 solar mass pair of stars with an orbital period of
27.3 days. The plane of the planet's orbit is rapidly precessing, and its
inclination only becomes sufficiently aligned with the primary star in the
latter portion of the Kepler data. Thus three transits are present in the
latter half of the light curve, but none of the three conjunctions that
occurred during the first half of the light curve produced transits. The
precession period is ~103 years, and during that cycle, transits are visible
only ~8% of the time. This has the important implication that for every system
like KIC 9632895 that we detect, there are ~12 circumbinary systems that exist
but are not currently exhibiting transits. The planet's mass is too small to
noticeably perturb the binary, consequently its mass is not measurable with
these data; but our photodynamical model places a 1-sigma upper limit of 16
Earth masses. With a period 8.8 times that of the binary, the planet is well
outside the dynamical instability zone. It does, however, lie within the
habitable zone of the binary, and making it the third of ten Kepler
circumbinary planets to do so.

increases the power consumption of ADC and DAC. This work focuses on a
point-to-point link where transmitter and receiver have multiple front ends and

Kepler light curve --- with a baseline greater than three years, composed of
virtually continuous, evenly sampled 30-minute measurements --- is
unprecedented in its quality and precision. We utilize two methods of power
spectral analysis to investigate the optical variability and search for
evidence of a bend frequency associated with a characteristic optical
variability timescale. Each method yields similar results. The first
interpolates across data gaps to use the standard Fourier periodogram. The
second, using the CARMA-based time-domain modeling technique of Kelly et al.
(2014), does not need evenly-sampled data. Both methods find excess power at
high frequencies that may be due to Kepler instrumental effects. More
importantly both also show strong bends ({\Delta}{\alpha} ~ 2) at timescales of
~5 days, a feature similar to those seen in the X-ray PSDs of AGN but never
before in the optical. This observed ~5 day timescale may be associated with
one of several physical processes potentially responsible for the variability.
A plausible association could be made with light-crossing, dynamical or thermal
timescales, depending on the assumed value of the accretion disk size and on
unobserved disk parameters such as {\alpha} and H/R. This timescale is not
consistent with the viscous timescale, which would be years in a ~10^7 Solar
mass AGN such as Zw 229-15. However there must be a second bend on long (>~1
year) timescales, and that feature could be associated with the viscous
timescale.

CALIFA Survey with the goal of finding correlations in the environmental
parameters at the location of different SN types. We recover the sequence in
association of different SN types to the star-forming regions by using several
indicators of the ongoing and recent SF related to both the ionized gas and the
stellar populations. While the total ongoing SF is on average the same for the
three SN types, SNe Ibc/IIb tend to happen closer to star-forming regions and
occur in higher SF density locations compared to SNe II and SNe~Ia, the latter
showing the weakest correlation. SNe~Ia host galaxies have on average masses
that are $\sim$0.3-0.8~dex higher than CC SNe hosts due to a larger fraction of
old stellar populations in the SNe~Ia hosts. Using the recent SN~Ia delay-time
distribution and the SFHs of the galaxies, we show that the SN~Ia hosts in our
sample should presently produce a factor 2 more SNe~Ia than the CC~SN hosts.
Since both types are in hosts with similar SF rate and hence similar CC~SN
rate, this can explain the mass difference between the SN~Ia and CC~SN hosts,
and reinforce the finding that at least part of SNe~Ia should originate from
very old progenitors. Comparing the mean SFH of the eight least massive
galaxies to that of the massive SF SN~Ia hosts we find that the low-mass
galaxies formed their stars over more extended time than the massive SN~Ia
hosts. We estimate that the low-mass galaxies should produce by a factor of 10
less SNe~Ia, and a factor of 3 less CC~SNe than the high-mass group. Therefore
the ratio between the number of CC~SNe and SNe~Ia is expected to increase with
decreasing the galaxy mass. CC~SNe tend to explode at positions with younger
stellar populations than the galaxy average, but the galaxy properties at
SNe~Ia locations are one average the same as the global ones.

derive the star formation history (SFH) over the entire lifetime of the galaxy

likelihood fit to the CMD we find that only ~10% of all star formation in
Aquarius took place more than 10 Gyr ago (lookback time equivalent to redshift
z ~2). The star formation rate increased dramatically ~6-8 Gyr ago (z ~
0.7-1.1) and then declined until the present time. The only known galaxy with a
more extreme confirmed delay in star formation is Leo A, a galaxy of similar
M(HI)/M(stellar), dynamical mass, mean metallicity, and degree of isolation.
The delayed stellar mass growth in these galaxies does not track the mean dark
matter accretion rate from CDM simulations. The similarities between Leo A and
Aquarius suggest that if gas is not removed from dwarf galaxies by interactions
or feedback, it can linger for several gigayears without cooling in sufficient
quantity to form stars efficiently. We discuss possible causes for the delay in
star formation including suppression by reionization and late-time mergers. We
find reasonable agreement between our measured SFHs and select cosmological
simulations of isolated dwarfs. Because star formation and merger processes are
both stochastic in nature, delayed star formation in various degees is

minimize the time and the resources required by ETL dataflows, this paper
presents a framework to optimize dataflows using shared cache and
parallelization techniques. The framework classifies the components in an ETL
dataflow into different categories based on their data operation properties.
The framework then partitions the dataflow based on the classification at
different granularities. Furthermore, the framework applies optimization
techniques such as cache re-using, pipelining and multi-threading to the
already-partitioned dataflows. The proposed techniques reduce system memory
footprint and the frequency of copying data between different components, and
also take full advantage of the computing power of multi-core processors. The

to constrain the structure of multiply imaged quasars, especially the accretion
disc and central supermassive black-hole system. However, the derived
constraints on models may be affected by large systematic errors introduced in
the various stages of modelling, namely, the macromodels, the microlensing
magnification maps, and the convolution with realistic disc profiles. In
particular, it has been known that different macromodels of the galaxy lens
that fit the observations equally well, can lead to different values of
convergence, $\kappa$, and shear, $\gamma$, required to generate magnification
maps. So far, 25 microlensed quasars have been studied using microlensing
techniques, where each system has been modelled and analyzed individually, or
in small samples. This is about to change due to the upcoming synoptic all-sky
surveys, which are expected to discover thousands of quasars suitable for
microlensing studies. In the present study we investigate the connection
between macromodels of the galaxy lens and microlensing magnification maps
throughout the parameter space in preparation for future studies of large
statistical samples of systems displaying microlensing. In particular, we use
55,900 maps produced by the GERLUMPH parameter survey (available online at
http://gerlumph.swin.edu.au ) and identify regions of parameter space where
macromodel uncertainties ($\Delta\kappa$,$\Delta\gamma$) lead to statistically
different magnification maps. Strategies for mitigating the effect of
$\Delta\kappa$,$\Delta\gamma$ uncertainties are discussed in order to
understand and control this potential source of systematic errors in accretion
disc constraints derived from microlensing.

(NSRL) located in Hefei is one of the earliest high-energy electron linear
accelerators in China. The electrons are accelerated to 200 MeV by five
acceleration tubes and are collimated by scrapers. The scraper aperture is
smaller than the acceleration tube one, so some electrons hit the materials
when passing through them. These lost electrons cause induced radioactivity
mainly due to bremsstrahlung and photonuclear reaction. This paper describes a
study of induced radioactivity for the NSRL Linac using FLUKA simulations and
gamma-spectroscopy. The measurements showed that electrons were lost mainly at
the scraper. So the induced radioactivity of the NSRL Linac is mainly produced
here. The radionuclide types were simulated using the FLUKA Monte Carlo code
and the results were compared against measurements made with a High Purity
Germanium (HPGe) gamma spectrometer. The NSRL linac had been retired because of
upgrading last year. The removed components were used to study induced
radioactivity. The radionuclides confirmed by the measurement are: $^{57}$Ni,
$^{52}$Mn, $^{51}$Cr, $^{58}$Co, $^{56}$Co, $^{57}$Co, $^{54}$Mn, $^{60}$Co and
$^{22}$Na, the first eight nuclides of which are predicted by FLUKA simulation.
The research will provide the theoretical basis for the similar accelerator

material selection and radiation protection design.

few-nucleon physics. Calculations of the triton binding energy based on the
solution of the relativistic Faddeev equation in general lead to a weaker
binding than the corresponding non-relativistic calculation. Purpose: In this
work we solve for the three-body binding energy as well as the wave function
and its momentum distribution. The effect of the different relativistic
ingredients are studied in detail. Method: Relativistic invariance is
incorporated within the framework of Poincar{\'e} invariant quantum mechanics.
The relativistic momentum-space Faddeev equation is formulated and directly
solved in terms of momentum vectors without employing a partial-wave
decomposition. Results: The relativistic calculation gives a three-body binding
energy which is about 3% smaller than its non-relativistic counterpart. In the
wave function, relativistic effects are manifested in the Fermi motion of the
spectator particle. Conclusions: Our calculations show that though the overall
relativistic effects in the three-body bound state are small, individual
effects by themselves are not necessarily small and must be taken into account
consistently.

the case of $n=3$, two transitions happen along the fundamental solution. Also
at a higher energy, there are two bifurcating branches. The lower energy branch
of these bifurcating branches, merges with the fundamental solution and both

A bifurcation in $\lambda = \lambda_{b1}$ happens with a higher energy than the

\lambda_{b2}$. The two branches of the second bifurcation are both very close
in energy to the lower energy branch of the first bifurcation, but they have
different electrical and geometrical properties. Therefore, for the case of

exclusive to each other in experimental observation. Here we make a systematic
analysis using the elementary methodology of quantum mechanics upon
  Young`s two-slit interferometer and Mach-Zehnder two-arm interferometer with
the focus placed on how to measure the interference pattern (wave nature) and
which-way information (particle nature) of quantum objects. We design several
schemes to simultaneously acquire the which-way information for an individual
quantum object and the high-contrast interference pattern for an ensemble of
these quantum objects by placing two sets of measurement instrument that are
well separated in space and whose perturbation on each other is negligibly
small within the interferometer at the same time. Yet, improper arrangement and
cooperation of these two sets of measurement instrument in the interferometer
would lead to failure of simultaneous observation of wave and particle
behavior.
  The internal freedoms of quantum object could be harnessed to probe both the
which-way information and interference pattern for the center-of-mass motion.
That quantum objects can behave beyond the wave-particle duality and
complementarity principle would stimulate new conceptual examination and
exploration of quantum theory at a deeper level.

propagation of the fundamental mode through the fibre. However, along the
maximum mode intensity axis, higher order modes have a longer evanescent field
extension and larger field amplitude at the fibre waist compared to the
fundamental mode, opening up new possibilities for optical manipulation and
particle trapping. In this work, we demonstrate a microfibre/optical tweezers
compact system for trapping and propelling dielectric particles based on the
excitation of the first group of higher order modes at the fibre waist. Single
polystyrene particles were trapped and propelled in the evanescent fields of
higher order and fundamental modes near the surface of microfibres. Speed
enhancement of particle propulsion was observed for the higher order modes
compared to the fundamental mode for particles ranging from 1 {\mu}m to 5
{\mu}m in diameter. The optical propelling velocity of a single, 3 {\mu}m
polystyrene particle was found to be 8 times faster under the higher order
evanescent field than the fundamental mode field for a waist power of 25 mW.
Experimental data and dynamic interactions between the evanescent field of
these two different fibre modes and the particles are supported by theoretical
calculations. This work can be extended to trapping and manipulation of
laser-cooled atoms for quantum networks.

contents by downloading data from already updated nodes, while neither the
stale node nor the updated nodes have any knowledge as to which data symbols

  We first present a generic lower bound on the amount of communication that is
necessary under any storage code with a linear encoding (while allowing
non-linear update protocols). This lower bound is derived under a set of
extremely weak conditions, giving all updated nodes access to the entire
modified data and the stale node access to the entire stale data as side
information. We then present codes and update algorithms that are optimal in
that they meet this lower bound. Next, we present a lower bound for an
important subclass of codes, that of linear Maximum-Distance-Separable (MDS)

algorithm that meets this lower bound. These results thus establish the
capacity of oblivious updates in terms of the communication requirements under

first gives a combinatorial criterion for representations of C to admit a

of representations. The second gives a combinatorial criterion for a general

connects to the theory of formal languages, and makes essential use of results

cleaner proofs and stronger statements. For example: we give a new, more

(i) the impurity scaling, (ii) unusual finite size $L$ corrections of the form
$\ln(L)/L$, as well as (iii) the renormalization group flow of the umklapp
scattering. The latter defines a length scale $L_u$ which becomes exceedingly
large the closer the system is to its transition into the charge-density wave
phase. Beyond this transition umklapp scattering is relevant in the
renormalization group sense. Field theory can only be employed for length
scales larger than $L_u$. For small to intermediate two-particle interactions,
for which the regime $L > L_u$ can be accessed, and taking into account the
finite size corrections resulting from (i) and (ii) we provide strong evidence
that the impurity backscattering contribution to the orthogonality exponent is
asymptotically given by $1/16$. While further increasing the two-particle
interaction leads to a faster renormalization group flow of the impurity
towards the cut chain fixed point, the increased bare amplitude of the umklapp
scattering renders it virtually impossible to confirm the expected asymptotic
value of $1/16$ given the accessible system sizes. We employ the density matrix

high-energy gamma-rays to gamma-gamma absorption by low-energy photons, on the
polarization of the gamma-ray and target photons. This process has so far only
been considered using the polarization-averaged gamma-gamma absorption cross
section. It is demonstrated that in the case of polarized gamma-ray emission,
subject to source-intrinsic gamma-gamma absorption by polarized target photons,
this may lead to a slight over-estimation of the gamma-gamma opacity by up to ~
10 % in the case of a perfectly ordered magnetic field. Thus, for realistic
astrophysical scenarios with partially ordered magnetic fields, the use of the
polarization-averaged gamma-gamma cross section is justified for practical
purposes, such as estimates of minimum Doppler factors inferred for gamma-ray
bursts and blazars, based on gamma-gamma transparency arguments, and this paper
quantifies the small error incurred by the unpolarized-radiation approximation.
Furthermore, it is shown that polarization-dependent gamma-gamma absorption of
initially polarized gamma-rays can lead to a slight increase in the
polarization beyond the spectral break caused by gamma-gamma absorption, to an
amount distinctly different from the change in polarization expected if the
same spectral break was produced by a break in the underlying electron
distribution. This may serve as a diagnostic of whether gamma-gamma absorption
is relevant in sources such as gamma-ray bursts and blazars where the gamma-ray
emission may be intrinsically highly polarized.

from cooperative effects between more than two atoms. This power law is
different from the $ P(\Gamma) \sim \Gamma^{-1}$ behavior, which has been
considered as a signature of Anderson localization of light in random systems.
We show that in dilute clouds, the center of the energy distribution is
described by Wigner's semicircle law in the scalar and vectorial cases. For
dense gases, this law is replaced in the vectorial case by the Laplace

the predictions of a model, in which the tail is formed as a result of
Comptonization of soft seed photons on bulk motion of matter near the compact
object. The amplitude of the tail varies with time with factor more than ten
with the faintest tail at the top of the so-called flaring branch of its
color-color diagram. We show that the minimal amplitude of the power law tail
is recorded when the component, corresponding to the innermost part of

Therefore we show that the presence of the hard X-ray tail may be related with
the existence of the inner part of the optically thick disk. We estimate

resonance takes place at temperature T\lesssim few MeV, significant distortions
are produced in the electron (anti)neutrino spectra, altering the abundance of
light element in Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN). Using the present
determination of $^4$He and deuterium primordial abundances we determine the
BBN constraints on the model parameters. We find that $^2$H/H density ratio
exclude much of the parameter space if one assume a baryon density at the best
fit value of Planck experiment, \Omega_B h^2= 0.02207, while bounds become
weaker for a higher \Omega_B h^2=0.02261, the 95 % C.L. upper bound of Planck.
Due to the large error on its experimental determination, the helium mass
fraction Y_p gives no significant bounds.

dataset, a subsample of targets with spectra unaffected by TiO bands was
extracted and statistically decontaminated from field stars. Once combined with
34 additional stars previously published by our group, a total sample of 135
member stars covering the entire radial extent of the system has been used to
determine the metallicity distribution function of Terzan 5. The iron
distribution clearly shows three peaks: a super-solar component at
[Fe/H]$\simeq0.25$ dex, accounting for 29% of the sample, a dominant sub-solar
population at [Fe/H]$\simeq-0.30$ dex, corresponding to 62% of the total, and a
minor (6%) metal-poor component at [Fe/H]$\simeq-0.8$ dex. Such a broad,
multi-modal metallicity distribution demonstrates that Terzan 5 is not a
genuine globular cluster but the remnant of a much more complex stellar system.

100 exposures covering ~60% of stars compiled in the catalog of Petit et al.

stellar wind mass-loss-rate, with a power-law form that is slightly steeper
than linear for the majority of the less luminous, lower-Mdot B stars and
flattens for the more luminous, higher-Mdot O stars. As the winds are
radiatively driven, these scalings can be equivalently written as relations
with the bolometric luminosity. The observed X-ray luminosities, and their
trend with mass-loss rates, are well reproduced by new MHD models, although a
few overluminous stars (mostly rapidly rotating objects) exist. No relation is
found between other X-ray properties (plasma temperature, absorption) and
stellar or magnetic parameters, contrary to expectations (e.g. higher
temperature for stronger mass-loss rate). This suggests that the main driver
for the plasma properties is different from the main determinant of the X-ray
luminosity. Finally, variations of the X-ray hardnesses and luminosities, in
phase with the stellar rotation period, are detected for some objects and they
suggest some temperature stratification to exist in massive stars'
magnetospheres.

(IRIS) of absorption features from a multitude of cool atomic and molecular
lines within the profiles of Si IV transition region lines. Many of these
spectral lines have not previously been detected in solar spectra. Methods: We
examined spectra taken from deep exposures of plage on 12 October 2013. We
observed unique absorption spectra over a magnetic element which is bright in
transition region line emission and the ultraviolet continuum. We compared the
absorption spectra with emission spectra that is likely related to
fluorescence. Results: The absorption features require a population of sub-5000
K plasma to exist above the transition region. This peculiar stratification is
an extreme deviation from the canonical structure of the chromosphere-corona
boundary . The cool material is not associated with a filament or discernible
coronal rain. This suggests that molecules may form in the upper solar
atmosphere on small spatial scales and introduces a new complexity into our
understanding of solar thermal structure. It lends credence to previous
numerical studies that found evidence for elevated pockets of cool gas in the
chromosphere.

correlates but not linearly with the product of BH mass ($m$ in solar mass) and
Eddington ratio ($\lambda$), and the power law indices ($\mu$) are
significantly less than unity for relatively low accretion ($\lambda<0.1$) AGN,
$P_{j}\propto (\lambda m)^{\mu}$, in the radio galaxies and the Seyfert
galaxies. This leads to a negative correlation between radio loudness and
$\lambda m$ for the low luminosity AGN, i.e. $R\propto (\lambda m)^{\rho}$ with
$\rho=(7/6)\mu-1<0$, which may be attributed to a contribution of BH spin to
total jet power assuming that the spin induced jet is gradually suppressed as
the accretion rate increases. Whereas, for the high-z quasars which often show
the slope $\mu\geq1$, a positive correlation between the radio loudness and
disc luminosity is predicted. We discuss that the jet powers of the high-z FRII
quasars are likely dominated by the accretion disc rather than by the BH spin.

locations with high frequency, and to move among them in a certain sequence
reflecting their habits and daily routine. This predictability has to be taken
into account in the design of location privacy preserving mechanisms (LPPMs) in
order to effectively protect users when they continuously expose their position
to location-based services (LBSs). In this paper, we describe a method for
creating LPPMs that are customized for a user's mobility profile taking into
account privacy and quality of service requirements. By construction, our LPPMs
take into account the sequential correlation across the user's exposed
locations, providing the maximum possible trajectory privacy, i.e., privacy for
the user's present location, as well as past and expected future locations.
Moreover, our LPPMs are optimal against a strategic adversary, i.e., an
attacker that implements the strongest inference attack knowing both the LPPM
operation and the user's mobility profile. The optimality of the LPPMs in the
context of trajectory privacy is a novel contribution, and it is achieved by
formulating the LPPM design problem as a Bayesian Stackelberg game between the
user and the adversary. An additional benefit of our formal approach is that
the design parameters of the LPPM are chosen by the optimization algorithm.

and effective methods for this purpose. The only restriction on the signal
(whose Z-transform is given) is that it must be absolutely summable (of course,
this limitation can be removed by a suitable scaling). The first proposed
method is based on the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) and the second one is
based on solving a linear system of algebraic equations, which is obtained
after truncating the signal whose Z-transform is known. Numerical examples are
also presented to confirm the efficiency of the proposed methods. Functions in
non-integer powers of $z$ are also briefly discussed and it is shown that such
functions cannot be obtained by taking the Z-transform from any discrete-time

chameleon-like screening. If one includes the cosmological expansion of the
universe, disformal effects that are usually taken to be absent can be present

screened on all scales when the cosmological field is slowly-rolling. We
investigate the cosmology of these models and use local tests of gravity to
place new constraints on the disformal coupling and find
$\mathcal{M}>\mathcal{O}(\textrm{eV})$, which is not competitive with

only forward packets on specified paths. This implements an overlay network of
routers where each overlay link corresponds to a path in the physical network.
We study dynamic routing implemented at the overlay. We develop a queue-based

We here focus on
a network structure derived from co-occurrences of people in traditional
newspaper media. We find three clear deviations from what can be expected in a
random graph. First, the average degree in the empirical network is much lower
than expected, and the average weight of a link much higher than expected.
Secondly, high degree nodes attract disproportionately much weight. Thirdly,
relatively much of the weight seems to concentrate between high degree nodes.
We believe this can be explained by the fact that most people tend to co-occur
repeatedly with the same people. We create a model that replicates these
observations qualitatively based on two self-reinforcing processes: (1) more

network that is used repeatedly, that is, if the output is not sorted, the
network is applied again using the output as input. The challenging task is to
construct such networks of small depth (called a period in this context). In
our previous paper entitled Faster 3-Periodic Merging Network we reduced twice
the time of merging on $3$-periodic networks, i.e. from $12\log N$ to $6\log
N$, compared to the first construction given by Kuty{\l}owski, Lory\'s and
Oesterdikhoff. Note that merging on $2$-periodic networks require linear time.
In this paper we extend our construction, which is based on Canfield and
Williamson $(\log N)$-periodic sorter, and the analysis from that paper to any
period $p \ge 4$. For $p\ge 4$ our $p$-periodic network merges two sorted
sequences of length $N/2$ in at most $\frac{2p}{p-2}\log N + p\frac{p-8}{p-2}$
rounds. The previous bound given by Kuty{\l}owski at al. was
$\frac{2.25p}{p-2.42}\log N$. That means, for example, that our $4$-periodic

optical quality of its focusing optics, which in turn mostly depends on the
shape accuracy and the surface finishing of the grazing-incidence X-ray mirrors
that compose the optical modules. To ensure the imaging performance during the
mirror manufacturing, a fundamental step is predicting the mirror point spread
function (PSF) from the metrology of its surface. Traditionally, the PSF
computation in X-rays is assumed to be different depending on whether the
surface defects are classified as figure errors or roughness. [...] The aim of
this work is to overcome this limit by providing analytical formulae that are
valid at any light wavelength, for computing the PSF of an X-ray mirror shell
from the measured longitudinal profiles and the roughness power spectral
density (PSD), without distinguishing spectral ranges with different
treatments. The method we adopted is based on the Huygens-Fresnel principle for
computing the diffracted intensity from measured or modeled profiles. In
particular, we have simplified the computation of the surface integral to only
one dimension, owing to the grazing incidence that reduces the influence of the
azimuthal errors by orders of magnitude. The method can be extended to optical
systems with an arbitrary number of reflections - in particular the Wolter-I,
which is frequently used in X-ray astronomy - and can be used in both near- and
far-field approximation. Finally, it accounts simultaneously for profile,
roughness, and aperture diffraction. We describe the formalism with which one
can self-consistently compute the PSF of grazing-incidence mirrors, [...]
Finally, we validate this by comparing the simulated PSF of a real Wolter-I
mirror shell with the measured PSF in hard X-rays.

suggest the presence of an unresolved light echo from interstellar dust and
dust formation in the ejecta, both of which are unique observations for a type

series, more and more data being collected comes from high dimensional
multivariate settings. This paper introduces the asymptotic concept of high
dimensional efficiency which quantifies the detection power of different
statistics in such situations. While being related to classic asymptotic
relative efficiency, it is different in that it provides the rate at which the
change can get smaller with dimension while still being detectable. This also
allows for comparisons of different methods with different null asymptotics as
is for example the case in high-dimensional change point settings. Based on
this new concept we investigate change point detection procedures using
projections and develop asymptotic theory for how full panel (multivariate)
tests compare with both oracle and random projections. Furthermore, for each
given projection we can quantify a cone such that the corresponding projection
statistic yields better power behavior if the true change direction is within
this cone. The effect of misspecification of the covariance on the power of the
tests is investigated, because in many high dimensional situations estimation
of the full dependency (covariance) between the multivariate observations in
the panel is often either computationally or even theoretically infeasible. It
turns out that the projection statistic is much more robust in this respect in
terms of size and somewhat more robust in terms of power. The theoretic
quantification by the theory is accompanied by simulation results which confirm
the theoretic (asymptotic) findings for surprisingly small samples. This shows
in particular that the concept of high dimensional efficiency is indeed
suitable to describe small sample power, and this is demonstrated in a
multivariate example of market index data.

  This insight is then combined with an algorithm that produces only
full-dimensional cells to give an accurate method of predicting the number of

However, strategies in the prisoner's dilemma game are only two strategies. Are

the paper develops a theory for zero-determinant strategies for multi-strategy

astrometric alerts by GAIA. Second, events can be predicted using known high
proper motion stars as lenses. This is much easier, as the location and time of
an event can be forecast. Using the GAIA source density, we estimate that the
sample size of high proper motion ($>300$ mas yr$^{-1}$) brown dwarfs needed to

small, only of the order of a hundred. This is comparable to the number of high

of $p_{\rm T}$ and event activity. The extracted $v_n$ values for $n=2$ to $5$
decrease with $n$. The $v_2$ and $v_3$ values are found to be positive in the

then increase to about 0.1 for $p_{\rm T}>4$ GeV. The $v_2(p_{\rm T})$,
$v_3(p_{\rm T})$ and $v_4(p_{\rm T})$ are compared to the $v_n$ coefficients in
Pb+Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\mathrm{NN}}} =2.76$ TeV with similar event
multiplicities. Reasonable agreement is observed after accounting for the
difference in the average $p_{\rm T}$ of particles produced in the two

proposed a pattern driven methodology for engineering self-aware and

Boron, being a potent neutron absorber, can alter the neutron flux causing
anomalous shifts and fluctuations in the power output of the reactor core. This
phenomenon reduces the operational flexibility of the plant and may force the
down-rating of the reactor. In this work an innovative approach is used to
combine first-principles calculations with thermodynamic data to evaluate the
possibility of B incorporation into the crystal structure of
NiFe${}_{2}$O${}_{4}$, under conditions typical to operating nuclear
pressurized water nuclear reactors. Analyses of temperature and pH dependence
of the defect formation energies indicate that B can accumulate in
NiFe${}_{2}$O${}_{4}$ as an interstitial impurity and may therefore be a major
contributor to the anomalous axial power shift observed in nuclear reactors.

  Herschel 160/250 and 250/350 micron surface brightness ratios","Accepted for publication in MNRAS",,"10.1093/mnras/stu1841",,"astro-ph.GA","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","  We examined variations in the 160/250 and 250/350 micron surface brightness
ratios within 24 nearby (<30 Mpc) face-on spiral galaxies observed with the
Herschel Space Observatory to identify the heating mechanisms for dust emitting
at these wavelengths. The analysis consisted of both qualitative and
quantitative comparisons of the 160/250 and 250/350 micron ratios to H alpha
and 24 micron surface brightnesses, which trace the light from star forming
regions, and 3.6 micron emission, which traces the light from the older stellar
populations of the galaxies. We find broad variations in the heating mechanisms
for the dust. In one subset of galaxies, we found evidence that emission at
<=160 microns (and in rare cases potentially at <=350 microns) originates from
dust heated by star forming regions. In another subset, we found that the
emission at >=250 microns (and sometimes at >=160 microns) originates from dust
heated by the older stellar population. In the rest of the sample, either the
results are indeterminate or both of these stellar populations may contribute
equally to the global dust heating. The observed variations in dust heating
mechanisms does not necessarily match what has been predicted by dust emission
and radiative transfer models, which could lead to overestimated dust
temperatures, underestimated dust masses, false detections of variability in
dust emissivity, and inaccurate star formation rate measurements.

the strong agreement among those two characterizations, providing thus an
important justification in terms of interpretability for the heat kernel.

objects, i.e. $\sim$210 spectroscopic single stars and $\sim$110 primaries in
binary systems, in the Tarantula nebula or 30 Doradus (30\,Dor) region. The
observations were taken using VLT/FLAMES and constitute the largest homogeneous
dataset of multi-epoch spectroscopy of O-type stars currently available. The
most distinctive feature of the $v_e\sin i$ distributions of the
presumed-single stars and primaries in 30 Dor is a low-velocity peak at around
100\,$\rm{km s^{-1}}$. Stellar winds are not expected to have spun-down the
bulk of the stars significantly since their arrival on the main sequence and
therefore the peak in the single star sample is likely to represent the outcome
of the formation process. Whereas the spin distribution of presumed-single
stars shows a well developed tail of stars rotating more rapidly than
300\,$\rm{km s^{-1}}$, the sample of primaries does not feature such a
high-velocity tail. The tail of the presumed-single star distribution is
attributed for the most part -- and could potentially be completely due -- to
spun-up binary products that appear as single stars or that have merged. This
would be consistent with the lack of such post-interaction products in the
binary sample, that is expected to be dominated by pre-interaction systems. The
peak in this distribution is broader and is shifted toward somewhat higher spin
rates compared to the distribution of presumed-single stars. Systems displaying
large radial velocity variations, typical for short period systems, appear
mostly responsible for these differences.

Model in a way complementary to searches for new particles at colliders. In the
weak sector the most general $\beta$ decay Hamiltonian contains, besides vector
and axial-vector terms, also scalar, tensor and pseudoscalar terms. Current
limits on the scalar and tensor coupling constants from neutron and nuclear
$\beta$ decay are on the level of several percent.
  The goal of this paper is extracting new information on tensor coupling
constants by measuring the $\beta$-asymmetry parameter in the pure Gamow-Teller
decay of $^{67}$Cu, thereby testing the V-A structure of the weak interaction.
An iron sample foil into which the radioactive nuclei were implanted was cooled
down to milliKelvin temperatures in a $^3$He-$^4$He dilution refrigerator. An
external magnetic field of 0.1 T, in combination with the internal hyperfine
magnetic field, oriented the nuclei. The anisotropic $\beta$ radiation was
observed with planar high purity germanium detectors operating at a temperature
of about 10\,K. An on-line measurement of the $\beta$ asymmetry of $^{68}$Cu
was performed as well for normalization purposes. Systematic effects were
investigated using Geant4 simulations.
  The experimental value, $\tilde{A}$ = 0.587(14), is in agreement with the
Standard Model value of 0.5991(2) and is interpreted in terms of physics beyond
the Standard Model. The limits obtained on possible tensor type charged
currents in the weak interaction hamiltonian are -0.045 $< (C_T+C'_T)/C_A <$
0.159 (90\% C.L.). The obtained limits are comparable to limits from other
correlation measurements in nuclear $\beta$ decay and contribute to further
constraining tensor coupling constants.

CCSN radio searches are thus more promising for yielding the complete,
unobscured star-formation rates in the local universe. The SKA yields the
possibility to piggyback for free in this area of research by carrying out
commensal, wide-field, blind transient survey observations. SKA1-SUR should be
able to discover several hundreds of CCSNe in just one year, compared to about
a dozen CCSNe that the VLASS would be able to detect in one year, at most. SKA,
with an expected sensitivity ten times that of SKA1, is expected to detect
CCSNe in the local Universe by the thousands. Therefore, commensal SKA

redshift 4 < z < 8 galaxies in the CANDELS GOODS-S, HUDF and HUDF parallel
fields. Based on non-parametric measurements and incorporating a careful
treatment of measurement biases, we quantify the typical size of galaxies at
each redshift as the peak of the log-normal size distribution, rather than the
arithmetic mean size. Parameterizing the evolution of galaxy half-light radius
as $r_{50} \propto (1+z)^n$, we find $n = -0.20 \pm 0.26$ at bright
UV-luminosities ($0.3L_{*(z=3)} < L < L_*$) and $n = -0.47 \pm 0.62$ at faint
luminosities ($0.12L_* < L < 0.3L_*$). Furthermore, simulations based on
artificially redshifting our z~4 galaxy sample show that we cannot reject the
null hypothesis of no size evolution. We show that this result is caused by a
combination of the size-dependent completeness of high-redshift galaxy samples
and the underestimation of the sizes of the largest galaxies at a given epoch.
To explore the evolution of galaxy morphology we first compare asymmetry
measurements to those from a large sample of simulated single S\'ersic
profiles, in order to robustly categorise galaxies as either `smooth' or
`disturbed'. Comparing the disturbed fraction amongst bright ($M_{UV} \leq
-20$) galaxies at each redshift to that obtained by artificially redshifting
our z~4 galaxy sample, while carefully matching the size and UV-luminosity
distributions, we find no clear evidence for evolution in galaxy morphology
over the redshift interval 4 < z < 8. Therefore, based on our results, a bright
($M_{UV} \leq -20$) galaxy at z~6 is no more likely to be measured as
`disturbed' than a comparable galaxy at z~4, given the current observational
constraints.

scaling is optimal, i.e. the current amplitude decreases slower with the system
size, at intermediate interactions.

living organisms is a fundamental challenge in science and technology. We study
the spatiotemporal patterns that emerge when an active nematicfilm of
microtubules and molecular motors is encapsulated within a shape-changing lipid
vesicle. Unlike in equilibrium systems, where defects are largely static
structures, in active nematics defects move spontaneously and can be described
as self-propelled particles. The combination of activity, topological
constraints and vesicle deformability produces a myriad of dynamical states. We
highlight two dynamical modes: a tunable periodic state that oscillates between
two defect configurations, and shape-changing vesicles with streaming
filopodia-like protrusions. These results demonstrate how biomimetic materials
can be obtained when topological constraints are used to control the
non-equilibrium dynamics of active matter.

  added for clarity",,,,"hep-th gr-qc","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A star collapsing gravitationally into a black hole emits a flux of
radiation, known as Hawking radiation. When the initial state of a quantum
field on the background of the star, is placed in the Unruh vacuum in the far
past, then in the exterior Hawking radiation corresponds to a flux of positive
energy radiation travelling outwards from near the surface to future infinity.
Based on pair creation, the evaporation of the collapsing star can be
equivalently described by the absorption of an ingoing negative energy flux of
radiation travelling towards the center of the star. Here, we are interested in
the evolution of the star during its collapse. Thus we include the backreaction
of the negative energy Hawking flux in the interior geometry of the collapsing
star when writing the full 4-dimensional Einstein and hydrodynamic equations.
Hawking radiation emitted before the star passes through its Schwarzschild
radius slows down and reverses the collapse of the star. The star evaporates
without forming an horizon or a singularity. This study provides a more
realistic investigation than the one first presented in [1], since the
backreaction of Hawking radiation flux on the collapsing star is studied in the
case when the initial state of the field is in Unruh's vacuum.

of biochemical reaction networks. Their complexity often precludes analytic
solution, and we rely on stochastic simulation algorithms to estimate system
statistics. The Gillespie algorithm is exact, but computationally costly as it
simulates every single reaction. As such, approximate stochastic simulation
algorithms such as the tau-leap algorithm are often used. Potentially
computationally more efficient, the system statistics generated suffer from
significant bias unless tau is relatively small, in which case the
computational time can be comparable to that of the Gillespie algorithm. The
multi-level method (Anderson and Higham, Multiscale Model. Simul. 2012) tackles
this problem. A base estimator is computed using many (cheap) sample paths at
low accuracy. The bias inherent in this estimator is then reduced using a
number of corrections. Each correction term is estimated using a collection of
paired sample paths where one path of each pair is generated at a higher
accuracy compared to the other (and so more expensive). By sharing random
variables between these paired paths the variance of each correction estimator
can be reduced. This renders the multi-level method very efficient as only a
relatively small number of paired paths are required to calculate each
correction term. In the original multi-level method, each sample path is
simulated using the tau-leap algorithm with a fixed value of $\tau$. This
approach can result in poor performance when the reaction activity of a system
changes substantially over the timescale of interest. By introducing a novel,
adaptive time-stepping approach where $\tau$ is chosen according to the
stochastic behaviour of each sample path we extend the applicability of the
multi-level method to such cases. We demonstrate the efficiency of our method
using a number of examples.

changepoints in long time-series, or equivalent, data. Many common approaches
to detecting changepoints, for example based on penalised likelihood or minimum
description length, can be formulated in terms of minimising a cost over
segmentations. Dynamic programming methods exist to solve this minimisation
problem exactly, but these tend to scale at least quadratically in the length
of the time-series. Algorithms, such as Binary Segmentation, exist that have a
computational cost that is close to linear in the length of the time-series,
but these are not guaranteed to find the optimal segmentation. Recently pruning
ideas have been suggested that can speed up the dynamic programming algorithms,
whilst still being guaranteed to find true minimum of the cost function. Here
we extend these pruning methods, and introduce two new algorithms for
segmenting data, FPOP and SNIP. Empirical results show that FPOP is
substantially faster than existing dynamic programming methods, and unlike the
existing methods its computational efficiency is robust to the number of
changepoints in the data. We evaluate the method at detecting Copy Number
Variations and observe that FPOP has a computational cost that is competitive

Symplectic dynamical symmetries allow the change of the number of excitation

Index that measures how tight a powder can be packed, under an assumption that
more easily packed powders usually flow poorly. Understanding how particles are
packed is important for revealing why a powder flows better than others. There
are two types of empirical equations that were proposed to fit the experimental
data of packing fractions vs. numbers of taps in literature: The inverse
logarithmic and the stretched exponential. Using the rate process theory and
the free volume concept, we obtain the tap density equations and they can be
reducible to the two empirical equations currently widely used in literature.
Our equations could potentially fit experimental data better with an additional
adjustable parameter. The tapping amplitude and frequency, the weight of the
granular materials, and the environment temperature are grouped into one
parameter that weighs the pace of packing process. The current results, in
conjunction with our previous findings, may imply that both dry(granular)and
wet(colloidal and polymeric) particle systems are governed by the same physical
mechanisms in term of the role of the free volume and how particles behave (a
rate controlled process).

their own gravity that mutually exert and experience gravitational forces. The
method we employ is to model the dynamical evolution of two isolated bars,
hosted within the same galactic system, under their mutual gravitational
interaction. In this study we present an analytical treatment of the secular
evolution of two bars that oscillate with respect one another. Two cases of
interaction, with and without geometrical deformation, are discussed. In the
latter case, the bars are described as modified Jacobi ellipsoids. These
triaxial systems are formed by a rotating fluid mass in gravitational
equilibrium with its own rotational velocity and the gravitational field of the
other bar. The governing equation for the variation of their relative angular
separation is then numerically integrated, which also provides the time
evolution of the geometrical parameters of the bodies. The case of rigid,
non-deformable, bars produces in some cases an oscillatory motion in the bodies
similar to that of a harmonic oscillator. For the other case, a deformable
rotating body that can be represented by a modified Jacobi ellipsoid under the
influence of an exterior massive body will change its rotational velocity to
escape from the attracting body, just as if the gravitational torque exerted by
the exterior body were of opposite sign. Instead, the exchange of angular
momentum will cause the Jacobian body to modify its geometry by enlarging its
long axis, located in the plane of rotation, thus decreasing its axial ratios.

to meet its need in terms of power and send a request (a message) to the
aggregator which does not correspond, in general, to its actual need. The
aggregator, which receives this request, not only wants to satisfy it but also
wants to manage the cost induced by the residential electricity distribution
network. Second, we establish connections between the exploited framework and
the quantization problem. Although the model assumed for the payoff functions
for the consumer and aggregator is quite simple, it allows one to extract
insights of practical interest from the analysis conducted. This allows us to
establish a direct connection with quantization, and more importantly, to open
a much more general challenge for source and channel coding.
