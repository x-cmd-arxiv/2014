spectroscopy spectra of non-magnetic Zn_2, a zero bias resonance was resolved
in magnetic Mn_2 and Ni_2 complexes. The case of Ni_2 is particularly
interesting as the experiments indicate two adsorption geometries with very
different properties. For Ni_2-complexes we have employed density functional
theory to further elucidate the situation. Our simulations show that one
geometry with relatively large Kondo temperatures T_K ~ 10K can be attributed
to distorted Ni_2 complexes, which are chemically bound to the surface via the
bipyrimidine unit. The second geometry, we assign to molecular fragmentation:
we suggest that the original binuclear molecule decomposes into two pieces,
including Ni(hexafluoroacetylacetonate)_2, when brought into contact with the

formation and evolution of the Milky Way, such as the passage of satellites and
vertical resonance and determines whether the warp is a long-lived or a
transient feature.
  We used the proper motions of the PPMXL survey, correcting of systematic
errors with the reference of quasars. From the color-magnitude diagram K versus
(J-K) we selected the standard candles corresponding to red clump giants and
used the information of their proper motions to build a map of the vertical
motions of our Galaxy. We derived the kinematics of the warp both analytically
and through a particle simulation to fit these data. Complementarily, we also
carried out the same analysis with red clump giants spectroscopically selected
with APOGEE data, and we predict the improvements in accuracy that will be
reached with future Gaia data.
  A simple model of warp with the height of the disk z_w(R,phi)=gamma (R-R_sun)
sin(phi-phi_w) fits the vertical motions if d(gamma)/dt/gamma=-34+/-17
Gyr^{-1}; the contribution to d(gamma)/dt comes from the southern warp and is
negligible in the north. The vertical motion in the warp apparently indicates
that the main S-shaped structure of the warp is a long-lived feature, whereas
the perturbation that produces an irregularity in the southern part is most
likely a transient phenomenon. With the use of the Gaia end-of-mission products
together with spectroscopically classified red clump giants, the precision in
vertical motions can be increased by an order of magnitude at least.

a period of darkness since most of the matter was in a neutral state. About a
billion years later, however, the intergalactic space was once again ionized.
The process, known as the cosmic reionization, required the operation of
mechanisms that are not well understood. Among other ionizing sources,
Population III stars, mini-quasars, and X-ray emitting microquasars have been
invoked.
  In this article we propose that primordial cosmic rays, accelerated at the
termination points of the jets of the first microquasars, may have contributed
to the reionization of the intergalactic space as well. For this we quantify
the ionization power of cosmic rays (electrons and protons) in the primordial
intergalactic medium using extensive particle cascade simulations.
  We establish that, depending on the fraction of electrons to protons
accelerated in the microquasar jets, cosmic rays should have contributed to the
reionization of the primordial intergalactic medium as much as X-rays from
microquasar accretion disks. If the primordial magnetic field was of the order
of $10^{-17}$ G, as some models suggest, cosmic rays had an important role in
ionizing the neutral material far beyond the birth places of the first stars.

having two asymptotically hyperbolic ends. The main property of Liouville
surfaces consists in the complete separability of the Hamilton-Jacobi equations
for the geodesic flow. An important related consequence is the fact that the
stationary wave equation can be separated into a system of a radial and angular
ODEs. The full scattering matrix at fixed energy associated to a scalar wave
equation on asymptotically hyperbolic Liouville surfaces can be thus simplified
by considering its restrictions onto the generalized harmonics corresponding to
the angular separated ODE. The resulting partial scattering matrices consists
in a countable set of $2 \times 2$ matrices whose coefficients are the so
called transmission and reflection coefficients. It is shown that the
reflection coefficients are nothing but generalized Weyl-Titchmarsh functions
for the radial ODE in which the generalized angular momentum is seen as the
spectral parameter. Using the Complex Angular Momentum method and recent
results on 1D inverse problem from generalized Weyl-Titchmarsh functions, we
show that the knowledge of the reflection operators at a fixed non zero energy
is enough to determine uniquely the metric of the asymptotically hyperbolic
Liouville surface under consideration.

in all shortest paths of the network. Therefore computing exact betweenness
values is impractical in large networks. For static networks, approximation
based on randomly sampled paths has been shown to be significantly faster in
practice. However, for dynamic networks, no approximation algorithm for
betweenness centrality is known that improves on static recomputation. We
address this deficit by proposing two incremental approximation algorithms (for
weighted and unweighted connected graphs) which provide a provable guarantee on
the absolute approximation error. Processing batches of edge insertions, our
algorithms yield significant speedups up to a factor of $10^4$ compared to
restarting the approximation. This is enabled by investing memory to store and
efficiently update shortest paths. As a building block, we also propose an
asymptotically faster algorithm for updating the SSSP problem in unweighted
graphs. Our experimental study shows that our algorithms are the first to make
in-memory computation of a betweenness ranking practical for million-edge
semi-dynamic networks. Moreover, our results show that the accuracy is even
better than the theoretical guarantees in terms of absolutes errors and the
rank of nodes is well preserved, in particular for those with high betweenness.

the Vlasov--Poisson equation for the collapse of spherically symmetric WDM
halos. For thermal relics with mass $m=1\,$keV/$c^2$, we find collapsed halos
with cores of size from $0.1$ to $0.6\,$kpc. The typical core is hollow, with
the mass density decreasing towards the core center by almost three orders of
magnitude from its maximum near the core radius $r_{\rm c}$. The core is in
equilibrium with the diffused part of the halo but far from virialization.
These properties are rooted in the conservation of the squared angular momentum
and in the original excess, proper of WDM initial conditions, of kinetic energy
in the core region. In a sample of more than one hundred simulated collapses,
the values of $r_{\rm c}$ and of the core density $\rho_{\rm c}$ are in the
range typical of dwarf spheroids, while the maximal circular velocities $V_{\rm
max}$ are proper of small disk galaxies. The product $\mu_{\rm c}=\rho_{\rm
c}r_{\rm c}$ takes values between $116\,M_\odot/$pc$^2$ and
$283\,M_\odot/$pc$^2$, while the surface density $\mu_0$, as determined from a
Burkert fit, is roughly three times larger. From these data and data obtained
at smaller values of $m$, we extrapolate for one particular halo $\mu_{\rm
c}=263(308)\,M_\odot/$pc$^2$ and $\mu_0=754(855)\,M_\odot/$pc$^2$ at
$m=2(3.3)\,$keV/$c^2$, to be compared with the observed value $140^{+83}_{-52}
M_\odot$/pc$^2$. In view of the many improvements and enhancements available,
we conclude that WDM is a viable solution for explaining the presence and the
size of cores in low mass galaxies.

the AMS-02 results very well. The dark matter scenario shows a drop at positron

determined the intensities and the widths of the three [OI] lines. We have
spatially extracted the spectra in order to achieve the best possible
resolution of about 1-2"", i.e., nucleocentric projected distances of 100 to 400
km depending on the geocentric distance of the comet. We have decontaminated
the [OI] green line from C2 lines blends. It is found that the observed G/R
ratio on all four comets varies as a function of nucleocentric projected
distance. This is mainly due to the collisional quenching of O(1S) and O(1D) by
water molecules in the inner coma. The observed green emission line width is
about 2.5 km/s and decreases as the distance from the nucleus increases which
can be explained by the varying contribution of CO2 to the O(1S) production in
the innermost coma. The photodissociation of CO2 molecules seems to produce
O(1S) closer to the nucleus while the water molecule forms all the O(1S) and
O(1D) atoms beyond 1000 km. Thus we conclude that the main parent species
producing O(1S) and O(1D) in the inner coma is not always the same. The
observations have been interpreted in the framework of the
coupled-chemistry-emission model of Bhardwaj & Raghuram (2012) and the upper
limits of CO2 relative abundances are derived from the observed G/R ratios.
Measuring the [OI] lines could indeed provide a new way to determine the CO2

neutron-star low-mass X-ray binaries when they have accretion luminosities

index (obtained from fitting a simple absorbed power-law in the 0.5-10 keV
range) increases with decreasing 0.5-10 keV X-ray luminosity (i.e., the
spectrum softens). Such behaviour has been reported before for individual
sources, but here we demonstrate that very likely most (if not all)
neutron-star systems behave in a similar manner and possibly even follow a
universal relation. When comparing the neutron-star systems with black-hole
systems, it is clear that most black-hole binaries have significantly harder
spectra at luminosities of 1E34 - 1E35 erg/s. Despite a limited number of data
points, there are indications that these spectral differences also extend to
the 1E35 - 1E36 erg/s range. This observed difference between the neutron-star
binaries and black-hole ones suggests that the spectral properties (between
0.5-10 keV) at 1E34 - 1E35 erg/s can be used to tentatively determine the
nature of the accretor in unclassified X-ray binaries. We discuss our results
in the context of properties of the accretion flow at low luminosities and we
suggest that the observed spectral differences likely arise from the
neutron-star surface becoming dominantly visible in the X-ray spectra. We also
suggest that both the thermal component and the non-thermal component might be
caused by low-level accretion onto the neutron-star surface for luminosities
below a few times 1E34 erg/s.

experimentally investigated by magnetotransport measurements on Shubnikov-de
Haas oscillations and weak localization. The hot-electron energy loss rate is
found to follow the predicted Bloch-Gr\""uneisen power-law behaviour of $T^4$ at
carrier temperatures from 1.4 K up to $\sim$100 K, due to electron-acoustic
phonon interactions with a deformation potential coupling constant of 22 eV. A
carrier density dependence $n_e^{-1.5}$ in the scaling of the $T^4$ power law
is observed in bilayer graphene, in contrast to the $n_e^{-0.5}$ dependence in
monolayer graphene, leading to a crossover in the energy loss rate as a
function of carrier density between these two systems. The electron-phonon
relaxation time in bilayer graphene is also shown to be strongly carrier
density dependent, while it remains constant for a wide range of carrier
densities in monolayer graphene. Our results and comparisons between the

with the X1 flare SOL2014-03-29T17:48 in active region NOAA 12017. We try to
discover if acoustic-like impulses or actions of the Lorentz force caused the
sunquake. We analyze spectro-polarimetric data obtained with the Facility
Infrared Spectrometer (FIRS) at the Dunn Solar Telescope (DST). Fortuitously
the FIRS slit crossed the flare kernel close to the acoustic source, during the
impulsive phase. The infrared FIRS data remain unsaturated throughout the
flare. Stokes profiles of lines of Si I 1082.7 nm and He I 1083.0 nm are
analyzed. At the flare footpoint, the Si I 1082.7 nm core intensity increases
by a factor of several, the IR continuum increases by 4 +/- 1%. Remarkably, the
Si I core resembles the classical Ca II K line's self-reversed profile. With
nLTE radiative models of H, C, Si and Fe these properties set the penetration
depth of flare heating to 100 +/- 100 km, i.e. photospheric layers. Estimates
of the non-magnetic energy flux are at least a factor of two less than the
sunquake energy flux. Milne-Eddington inversions of the Si I line show that the
local magnetic energy changes are also too small to drive the acoustic pulse.
Our work raises several questions: Have we ""missed"" the signature of downward
energy propagation? Is it intermittent in time and/or non-local? Does the 1-2 s
photospheric radiative damping time discount compressive modes?

do. In this reflective essay, we explore math as a language and consider the
language of math in physics through the lens of cognitive linguistics. We begin
by offering a number of examples that show how the use of math in physics
differs from the use of math as typically found in math classes. We then
explore basic concepts in cognitive semantics to show how humans make meaning
with language in general. The critical elements are the roles of embodied
cognition and interpretation in context. Then we show how a theoretical
framework commonly used in physics education research, resources, is coherent
with and extends the ideas of cognitive semantics by connecting embodiment to
phenomenological primitives and contextual interpretation to the dynamics of
meaning making with conceptual resources, epistemological resources, and
affect. We present these ideas with illustrative case studies of students

precision that demands a deeper understanding of potential systematic biases in
galaxy shape measurements than has been achieved to date. We use analytic and
computational techniques to study the impact on shape measurements of two
atmospheric chromatic effects for ground-based surveys such as the Dark Energy
Survey and the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST): (i) atmospheric
differential chromatic refraction and (ii) wavelength dependence of seeing. We
investigate the effects of using the point spread function (PSF) measured with
stars to determine the shapes of galaxies that have different spectral energy
distributions than the stars. We find that both chromatic effects lead to
significant biases in galaxy shape measurements for current and future surveys,
if not corrected. Using simulated galaxy images, we find a form of chromatic
`model bias' that arises when fitting a galaxy image with a model that has been
convolved with a stellar, instead of galactic, point spread function. We show
that both forms of atmospheric chromatic biases can be predicted (and
corrected) with minimal model bias by applying an ordered set of perturbative
PSF-level corrections based on machine-learning techniques applied to six-band
photometry. Catalog-level corrections do not address the model bias. We
conclude that achieving the ultimate precision for weak lensing from current

the wavelength dependence of the PSF from the atmosphere, and from other

of a fraction of the Comptonized photons impinging back into the soft photon
source. We find that when the oscillation is due to the soft photon source, the
variation of the fractional root mean sqaure (r.m.s) is nearly constant with
energy and the time-lags are hard. However, for the case when the oscillation
is due to variation in the heating rate of the corona, and when a significant
fraction of the photons impinge back into the soft photon source, the r.m.s
increases with energy and the time lags are soft. As an example, we compare the

Spin-orbit interaction for donor spins in germanium is in many orders of
magnitude stronger than in silicon. In a uniform bulk material it leads to very
short spin lifetimes. However the lifetime increases dramatically when the
donor is placed into a quasi-2D phononic crystal and the energy of the Zeeman
splitting is tuned to lie within a phonon bandgap. In this situation single
phonon processes are suppressed by energy conservation. The remaining
two-phonon decay channel is very slow. The Zeeman splitting within the gap can
be fine tuned to induce a strong, long-range coupling between the spins of
remote donors via exchange by virtual phonons. This, in turn, opens a very
efficient way to manipulate the quits. We explore various geometries of
phononic crystals in order to maximize the coherent qubit-qubit coupling while
keeping the decay rate minimal. We find that phononic crystals with unit cell
sizes of 100-150 nm are viable candidates for quantum computing applications

need for adaptive query processing techniques that can re-plan in the presence
of failures or unanticipated performance changes. A status update on the data
distributions or the compute nodes may have significant repercussions on the
choice of which query plan should be running. Ideally, new system architectures
would be able to make cost-based decisions about reallocating work, migrating
data, etc., and react quickly as real-time status information becomes
available. Existing cost-based query optimizers are not incremental in nature,
and must be run ""from scratch"" upon each status or cost update. Hence, they
generally result in adaptive schemes that can only react slowly to updates.
  An open question has been whether it is possible to build a cost-based
re-optimization architecture for adaptive query processing in a streaming or
repeated query execution environment, e.g., by incrementally updating optimizer
state given new cost information. We show that this can be achieved
beneficially, especially for stream processing workloads. Our techniques build
upon the recently proposed approach of formulating query plan enumeration as a
set of recursive datalog queries; we develop a variety of novel optimization
approaches to ensure effective pruning in both static and incremental cases. We

discriminating boosted Z bosons from massive QCD jets using observables formed
from the n-point energy correlation functions. We show that power counting
alone gives a definite prediction for the observable that optimally separates
the background-rich from the signal-rich regions of phase space. Power counting
can also be used to understand effects of phase space cuts and the effect of
contamination from pile-up, which we discuss. As these arguments rely only on

due to their motion through the intra-cluster medium (ICM). Deep X-ray
observations reveal the fine-structure of the galaxy's remnant atmosphere and
its gas tail and wake. This fine-structure depends on dynamic conditions
(galaxy potential, initial gas contents, orbit through the host cluster),
orbital stage (early infall, pre-/post-pericenter passage), and ICM plasma
properties (thermal conductivity, viscosity, magnetic field structure). We aim
to disentangle dynamic and plasma effects in order to use stripped ellipticals
as probes of ICM plasma properties. This first paper of a series investigates
the hydrodynamics of progressive gas stripping by means of inviscid
hydrodynamical simulations. We distinguish a long-lasting initial relaxation
phase and a quasi-steady stripping phase. During quasi-steady stripping, the
ICM flow around the remnant atmosphere resembles the flow around solid bodies,
including a `deadwater' region in the near wake. Gas is stripped from the
remnant atmosphere predominantly at its sides via Kelvin-Helmholtz
instabilities. The downstream atmosphere is largely shielded from the ICM wind
and thus shaped into a tail. Observationally, both, this `remnant tail' and the
stripped gas in the wake can appear as a `tail', but only in the wake can
galactic gas mix with the ambient ICM. While the qualitative results are
generic, the simulations presented here are tailored to the Virgo elliptical
galaxy M89 (NGC 4552) for the most direct comparison to observations. Papers II

for two separate families of dwarfs, neither in terms of their location

inconsistent with its galaxies stemming from a stochastic merger-driven

30-250mas and brightness contrasts of Delta H < 4 and Delta H < 5. Taking

prediction of the standard cosmological model. In this paper, we study the
impact of such background on the spatial distribution of both Dark Matter (DM)
and galaxies, by coupling $N$-body numerical simulations with semi-analytic
models (SAMs) of galaxy formation. Cosmological simulations including massive
neutrinos predict a slower evolution of DM perturbations with respect to the
$\Lambda$CDM runs with the same initial conditions and a suppression on the
matter power spectrum on small and intermediate scales, thus impacting on the
predicted properties of galaxy populations. We explicitly show that most of
these deviations are driven by the different $\sigma_8$ predicted for
cosmologies including a massive neutrino background. We conclude that
independent estimates of $\sigma_8$ are needed, in order to unambiguously
characterise the effect of this background on the growth of structures. Galaxy
properties alone are a weak tracer of deviations with respect to the
$\Lambda$CDM run, but their combination with the overall matter distribution at
all scales allows to disentangle between different cosmological models.
Moreover, these deviations go on opposite direction with respect to competing
models like modified gravity, thus weakening any detectable cosmological
signal. Given the ubiquitous presence of a neutrino background, these effects
have to be taken into account in future missions aimed at constraining the

progressively stripped of their gaseous atmospheres. X-ray observations reveal
the structure of galactic tails, wakes, and the interface between the galactic
gas and the ICM. This fine-structure depends on dynamic conditions (galaxy
potential, initial gas contents, orbit in the host cluster), orbital stage
(early infall, pre-/post-pericenter passage), as well as on the still
ill-constrained ICM plasma properties (thermal conductivity, viscosity,
magnetic field structure). Paper I describes flow patterns and stages of
inviscid gas stripping. Here we study the effect of a Spitzer-like temperature
dependent viscosity corresponding to Reynolds numbers, Re, of 50 to 5000 with
respect to the ICM flow around the remnant atmosphere. Global flow patterns are
independent of viscosity in this Reynolds number range. Viscosity influences
two aspects: In inviscid stripping, Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities (KHIs) at
the sides of the remnant atmosphere lead to observable horns or wings.
Increasing viscosity suppresses KHIs of increasing length scale, and thus
observable horns and wings. Furthermore, in inviscid stripping, stripped
galactic gas can mix with the ambient ICM in the galaxy's wake. This mixing is
suppressed increasingly with increasing viscosity, such that viscously stripped
galaxies have long X-ray bright, cool wakes. We provide mock X-ray images for
different stripping stages and conditions. While these qualitative results are
generic, we tailor our simulations to the Virgo galaxy M89 (NGC 4552), where
Re~ 50 corresponds to a viscosity of 10% of the Spitzer level. Paper III
compares new deep Chandra and archival XMM-Newton data to our simulations.

exceed the data by $(5.2 \pm 4.3)$% for the BaSTI models and by $(17.1 \pm

statistical. These two offsets are brought to zero if the Galactic globular
cluster metallicity scale is assumed to be overestimated by a linear shift of
$\sim 0.11$ dex and $\sim 0.36$ dex respectively. This inference based on RGBB
star counts goes in the opposite direction to the increase in metallicities of

between predicted and observed RGBB luminosities. This comparison is a
constraint on ""deep mixing"" models of stellar interiors, which predict
decreased rather than increased RGBB star counts. We tabulate the predictions
for RGBB star counts as a function of [Fe/H], [$\alpha$/Fe], CNONa, initial

outflows, as well as being the precursor to molecular clouds, the sites of star
formation. Since 21cm emission from neutral hydrogen can only be directly
observed in the local universe, we rely on Ly{\alpha} emission, and Ly{\alpha}
and MgII absorption to probe the physics that drives galaxy evolution at higher
redshifts. Furthermore, these tracers are sensitive to a range of hydrogen
densities that cover the interstellar medium, the circumgalactic medium and the
intergalactic medium, providing an invaluable means of studying gas physics in
regimes where it is poorly understood. At high redshift, Ly{\alpha} emission

the behaviour that the flux auto-power spectra and cross-power spectra

is changed in a range of values that bracket a reference model, while
cosmological parameters are kept fixed to best fit the cosmic microwave
background data. We present empirical fits that describe at the sub-percent
level the dependence of the power spectra on the thermal parameters. At the
largest scales, the power spectra show a constant bias between each other that
is set by the parameters describing the IGM thermal state. The cross-power
spectrum has an oscillatory pattern and crosses zero at a scale which depends
on $T_0$, the IGM temperature at the mean density, for reasonable values of the
power-law index $\gamma$ of the IGM temperature-density relation
($T=T_0(1+\delta)^{\gamma-1}$). By performing a Fisher matrix analysis, we find
that the power spectrum $P_{\beta\beta}$ is more sensitive to the thermal
history than $P_{\alpha\alpha}$ alone, due to the fact that it probes denser
regions than Lyman-alpha. When we combine the power and cross spectra the
constraints on $\gamma$ can be improved by a factor $\sim 4$, while the
constraints on $T_0$ improve by a factor of $\sim 2$. We address the role of
signal-to-noise and resolution by mocking realistic observations and we
conclude that the framework presented in this work can significantly improve

boundary with a corner contains a subleading logarithmic scaling term with a
universal coefficient. It has been conjectured that this coefficient is, to
leading order, proportional to the number of field components N in the
associated O(N) continuum $\phi^4$ field theory. Using density matrix
renormalization group calculations combined with the powerful numerical linked
cluster expansion technique, we confirm this scenario for the O(2)
Wilson-Fisher fixed point in a striking way, through direct calculation at the
quantum critical points of two very different microscopic models. The value of
this corner coefficient is, to within our numerical precision, twice the
coefficient of the Ising fixed point. Our results add to the growing body of
evidence that this universal term in the R\'enyi entanglement entropy reflects
the number of low-energy degrees of freedom in a system, even for strongly

constraining how well it is able to infer the true values for galaxy properties

a means of testing SED modelling techniques. Here, we present a numerical
experiment in which we apply the SED modelling code MAGPHYS to ultraviolet
(UV)--millimetre (mm) synthetic photometry generated from hydrodynamical
simulations of an isolated disc galaxy and a major galaxy merger by performing
three-dimensional dust radiative transfer. We compare the properties inferred

physical parameters of the simulated galaxies well. In particular, it recovers
consistent parameters irrespective of the viewing angle, with smoothly varying
results for neighbouring time steps of the simulation, even though each viewing
angle and time step is modelled independently. The notable exception to this
rule occurs when we use an SMC-type intrinsic dust extinction curve in the
radiative transfer calculations. In this case, the two-component dust model
used by MAGPHYS is unable to effectively correct for the attenuation of the
simulated galaxies, which leads to potentially significant errors (although we
obtain only marginally acceptable fits in this case). Overall, our results give

performance. Repeat collaborations have two contradictory aspects. A positive
aspect is team development or experience, and a negative aspect is team
degeneration or decline. Since both contradicting phenomena are observed,
inventors have a dilemma as to whether they should keep collaborating in a team
or not. The dilemma has not previously been quantitatively analyzed.
  We provide quantitative and extensive analyses of the dilemma in creative
projects by using patent data from Japan and the United States. We confirm
three predictions to quantitatively validate the existence of the dilemma. The
first prediction is that the greater the patent a team achieves, the longer the
team will work together. The second prediction is that the impact of
consecutive patents decreases after a team makes a remarkable invention, which
is measured by the impact of patents. The third prediction is that the
expectation of impact with new teams is greater than that with the same teams
successful in the past. We find these predictions are validated in patents
published in Japan and the United States. On the basis of these three
predictions, we can quantitatively validate the dilemma in creative projects.
We also propose preventive strategies for degeneration. One is developing
technological diversity, and another is developing inventor diversity in
teams.We find the two strategies are both effective by validating with the
data.

on rhythms that rely on a particu- lar excitability property, the
post-inhibitory rebound, an intrinsic cellular property that elicits transient
membrane depolarization when released from hyperpolarization. Two distinct
ionic currents can evoke this transient depolarization: a
hyperpolarization-activated cation current and a low-threshold T-type calcium

current and provides a slow-positive feedback at the cellular level that is
absent in the cation current. We show that this slow- positive feedback is
necessary and sufficient to endow the network rhythm with physiological
modulation and robustness properties. This study thereby identifies an
essential cellular property to be retained at the network level in modeling
network robustness and modulation.

onto fixed particle numbers in each layer. One of these Hamiltonians describes
a gapped topological phase while the other is gapless. However, on introduction
of a pair tunneling term, the second system becomes gapped and develops the
same topological order as the gapped Hamiltonian. Supported by the exact
solution of the full zero-energy quasihole spectrum and a conformal field
theory approach, we develop an intuitive picture of this system as two coupled
composite fermion superconductors. In this language, pair tunneling provides a
Josephson coupling of the superconducting phases of the two layers, and gaps
out the Goldstone mode associated with particle transport between the layers.
In particular, this implies that quasiparticles are confined between the
layers. In the bulk, the resulting phase has the topological order of the
Halperin 220 phase with $U(1)_2\times U(1)_2$ topological order, but it is

the giant planets' orbital migration in the gaseous protoplanetary disk.
Jupiter first migrated inward then Jupiter and Saturn migrated back outward
together. If Jupiter's turnaround or ""tack"" point was at ~1.5 AU the inner disk
of terrestrial building blocks would have been truncated at ~1 AU, naturally
producing the terrestrial planets' masses and spacing. During the gas giants'
migration the asteroid belt is severely depleted but repopulated by distinct
planetesimal reservoirs that can be associated with the present-day S and C
types. The giant planets' orbits are consistent with the later evolution of the
outer Solar System.
  Here we confront common criticisms of the Grand Tack model. We show that some
uncertainties remain regarding the Tack mechanism itself; the most critical
unknown is the timing and rate of gas accretion onto Saturn and Jupiter.
Current isotopic and compositional measurements of Solar System bodies --
including the D/H ratios of Saturn's satellites -- do not refute the model. We
discuss how alternate models for the formation of the terrestrial planets each
suffer from an internal inconsistency and/or place a strong and very specific
requirement on the properties of the protoplanetary disk.
  We conclude that the Grand Tack model remains viable and consistent with our
current understanding of planet formation. Nonetheless, we encourage additional
tests of the Grand Tack as well as the construction of alternate models.

scales of the virial radius (Mvir~160kpc), we measure a high covering fraction
fC=0.73+/-0.10 to strong CII absorption (rest equivalent width W1334>0.2A),
implying a massive reservoir of cool (T~10^4K) metal enriched gas. We
conservatively estimate a metal mass exceeding 10^8 Msun. We propose these
metals trace enrichment of the incipient intragroup/intracluster medium that
these halos eventually inhabit. This cool CGM around quasars is the pinnacle
amongst galaxies observed at all epochs, as regards covering fraction and
average equivalent width of HI Lya and low-ion metal absorption. We argue that
the properties of this cool CGM primarily reflect the halo mass, and that other
factors such as feedback, star-formation rate, and accretion from the
intergalactic medium are secondary. We further estimate, that the CGM of
massive, z~2 galaxies accounts for the majority of strong MgII absorption along

measure the quasar-CIV cross-correlation function: xi(r)=(r/r0)^-g with r0 =

dynamics of electronically excited pyrazine in a pump and probe experiment. For
pump pulses created without feedback from the product signal, the ion growth
curve (the parent ion signal as a function of pump/probe delay) was described
quantitatively by the classical rate equations for internal conversion of the
$S_2$ and $S_1$ states. Very different, non-classical behavior was observed
when a genetic algorithm (GA) was used to minimize the ion signal at some
pre-determined target time, T. Two qualitatively different control mechanisms
were identified for early (T$<1.5$ ps) and late (T$>1.5$ ps) target times. In
the former case, the ion signal was largely suppressed for $t<T$, while for $t
\gg T$ the ion signal produced by the GA-optimized pulse and a transform
limited (TL) pulse coalesced. In contrast, for $T>1.5$ ps the ion growth curve
followed the classical rate equations for $t<T$, while for $t \gg T$ the
quantum yield for the GA-optimized pulse was much smaller than for a TL pulse.
We interpret the first type of behavior as an indication that the wave packet
produced by the pump laser is localized in a region of the $S_2$ potential
energy surface where the vertical ionization energy exceeds the probe photon
energy, whereas the second type of behavior may be described by a reduced
absorption cross section for $S_0 \rightarrow S_2$ followed by incoherent decay
of the excited molecules.

linking the AGN activity with the evolution of their host galaxy. At present, a
complete census of obscured AGN is still missing. The purpose of this work is
to assess the reliability of the [NeV] emission line at 3426 A to pick up
obscured AGN up to z~1 by assuming that [NeV] is a reliable proxy of the
intrinsic AGN luminosity and using moderately deep X-ray data to characterize
the amount of obscuration. A sample of 69 narrow-line (Type 2) AGN at
z=0.65-1.20 were selected from the 20k-zCOSMOS Bright galaxy sample on the
basis of the presence of the [NeV] emission. The X-ray properties of these
galaxies were then derived using the Chandra-COSMOS coverage of the field; the
X-ray-to-[NeV] flux ratio, coupled with X-ray spectral and stacking analyses,
was then used to infer whether Compton-thin or Compton-thick absorption were
present in these sources. Then the [NeV] luminosity function was computed to
estimate the space density of Compton-thick (CT) AGN at z~0.8. Twenty-three
sources were detected by Chandra, and their properties are consistent with
moderate obscuration (on average, ~a few 10^{22} cm^-2). The X-ray properties
of the remaining 46 X-ray undetected Type 2 AGN were derived using X-ray
stacking analysis. Current data indicate that a fraction as high as ~40% of the
present sample is likely to be CT. The space density of CT AGN with
logL_2-10keV>43.5 at z=0.83 is (9.1+/-2.1) 10^{-6} Mpc^{-3}, in good agreement
with both XRB model expectations and the previously measured space density for
objects in a similar redshift and luminosity range. We regard our selection
technique for CT AGN as clean but not complete, since even a mild extinction in
the NLR can suppress [NeV] emission. Therefore, our estimate of their space
density should be considered as a lower limit.

hierarchy) have IGs at least (1-epsilon)n/t, where n is the number of vertices
of the input graph. Our lower bounds are nearly tight.
  Our results show that restricted yet powerful models of computation derived
by many L&P systems fail to witness c-approximate solutions to t-PVC for any
constant c, and for t = O(n). This is one of the very few known examples of an
intractable combinatorial optimization problem for which LP-based algorithms
induce a constant approximation ratio, still lift-and-project LP and SDP
tightenings of the same LP have unbounded IGs.
  We also show that the SDP that has given the best algorithm known for t-PVC
has integrality gap n/t on instances that can be solved by the level-1 LP
relaxation derived by the LS system. This constitutes another rare phenomenon
where (even in specific instances) a static LP outperforms an SDP that has been
used for the best approximation guarantee for the problem at hand. Finally, one
of our main contributions is that we make explicit of a new and simple
methodology of constructing solutions to LP relaxations that almost trivially
satisfy constraints derived by all SDP L&P systems known to be useful for
algorithmic positive results (except the La system).

profiles, allowing the production of near real time SEP nowcasts and forecasts,
when paired with appropriate near real time triggers. SPARX has the capability
to produce SEP forecasts within minutes of being triggered by observations of a
solar eruptive event. The model is based on the test particle approach and is
spatially 3D, thus allowing for the possibility of transport in the direction
perpendicular to the magnetic field. The model naturally includes the effects
of perpendicular propagation due to drifts and drift-induced deceleration. The
modelling framework and the way in which parameters of relevance for Space

lengthy computation times add important overhead to this task. Previous work
has demonstrated that fMRI data admits a sparse representation in the form a
discrete point-process containing sufficient information for the efficient
estimation of functional connectivity between all pairs of voxels. In this work
we validate this method, by replicating results obtained with standard
whole-brain voxel-wise linear correlation matrices in two datasets. In the
first one (n=71) we study the changes in node strength (a measure of network
centrality) during deep sleep. The second is a large database (n=1147) of

of 1 % of the original fMRI time series. Overall, these results demonstrate
that the proposed approach allows efficient fMRI data compression and a

domain families. Here we formally show that for ""stratified"" multiple
hypothesis testing problems, controlling the local False Discovery Rate (lFDR)
per stratum, or partition, yields the most predictions across the data at any
given threshold on the FDR or E-value over all strata combined. For the
important problem of protein domain prediction, a key step in characterizing
protein structure, function and evolution, we show that stratifying statistical
tests by domain family yields excellent results. We develop the first
FDR-estimating algorithms for domain prediction, and evaluate how well
thresholds based on q-values, E-values and lFDRs perform in domain prediction
using five complementary approaches for estimating empirical FDRs in this
context. We show that stratified q-value thresholds substantially outperform
E-values. Contradicting our theoretical results, q-values also outperform
lFDRs; however, our tests reveal a small but coherent subset of domain
families, biased towards models for specific repetitive patterns, for which
FDRs are greatly underestimated due to weaknesses in random sequence models.
Usage of lFDR thresholds outperform q-values for the remaining families, which
have as-expected noise, suggesting that further improvements in domain
predictions can be achieved with improved modeling of random sequences.
Overall, our theoretical and empirical findings suggest that the use of
stratified q-values and lFDRs could result in improvements in a host of
structured multiple hypothesis testing problems arising in bioinformatics,
including genome-wide association studies, orthology prediction, motif

against bar instabilities. We find that the change of the bar fraction with

with the form
$f_{\mathrm{bar}}=f_{\mathrm{bar}}$(M$_{\mathrm{*}}^{\alpha}/$M$_{\mathrm{h}}$)

physical properties such as color and spin parameter when
M$_{\mathrm{*}}^{3/2}/$M$_{\mathrm{h}}$ is fixed. With our sample of galaxies
segregated into centrals and satellites, we also compare the fraction of barred
galaxies in each group, finding a slightly higher bar fraction for satellites
when compared with centrals at fixed stellar mass, but at fixed color this
difference becomes very weak. This result, in agreement with previous studies,
confirms that the bar fraction does not directly depend on the group/cluster

mapping from the transition matrix of classical Markovian dynamics of the Ising
model to a quantum Hamiltonian and vice versa. It is shown that these two
operators, the transition matrix and the Hamiltonian, share the eigenvalue
spectrum. Thus, if simulated annealing with slow temperature change does not
encounter a difficulty caused by an exponentially long relaxation time at a
first-order phase transition, the same is true for the corresponding process of
quantum annealing in the adiabatic limit. One of the important differences
between the classical-to-quantum mapping and the converse quantum-to-classical
mapping is that the Markovian dynamics of a short-range Ising model is mapped
to a short-range quantum system, but the converse mapping from a short-range
quantum system to a classical one results in long-range interactions. This
leads to a difference in efficiencies that simulated annealing can be
efficiently simulated by quantum annealing but the converse is not necessarily
true. We conclude that quantum annealing is easier to implement and is more
flexible than simulated annealing. We also point out that the present mapping
can be extended to accommodate explicit time dependence of temperature, which
is used to justify the quantum-mechanical analysis of simulated annealing by
Somma, Batista, and Ortiz. Additionally, an alternative method to solve the
non-equilibrium dynamics of the one-dimensional Ising model is provided through
the classical-to-quantum mapping.

orbiting HR8799. Our study relies on the published astrometric history of this
system augmented with an epoch obtained with the Project 1640 coronagraph +
Integral Field Spectrograph (IFS) installed at the Palomar Hale telescope. We
first focus on the intricacies associated with astrometric estimation using the
combination of an Extreme Adaptive Optics system (PALM-3000), a coronagraph and
an IFS. We introduce two new algorithms. The first one retrieves the stellar
focal plane position when the star is occulted by a coronagraphic stop. The
second one yields precise astrometric and spectro-photometric estimates of
faint point sources even when they are initially buried in the speckle noise.
The second part of our paper is devoted to studying orbital motion in this
system. In order to complement the orbital architectures discussed in the
literature, we determine an ensemble of likely Keplerian orbits for HR8799bcde,
using a Bayesian analysis with maximally vague priors regarding the overall
configuration of the system. While the astrometric history is currently too
scarce to formally rule out coplanarity, HR8799d appears to be misaligned with
respect to the most likely planes of HR8799bce orbits. This misalignment is
sufficient to question the strictly coplanar assumption made by various authors
when identifying a Laplace resonance as a potential architecture. Finally, we
establish a high likelihood that HR8799de have dynamical masses below 13 M_Jup
using a loose dynamical survival argument based on geometric close encounters.
We illustrate how future dynamical analyses will further constrain dynamical
masses in the entire system.

flux rope (FR) collapses onto the surface at a speed of 1.5 km/s after a
partial eruption in FL1. The FR then gradually grows to reach a higher altitude

larger decrease of the flux-weighted centroid separation of opposite magnetic
polarities and a greater change of the horizontal field on the surface. These
imply a more violent coronal implosion with corresponding more intense surface

ambient fields, it undergoes a southward turning after both events. This agrees
with the asymmetric decay of the penumbra observed in the peripheral regions.
(3) The amounts of free magnetic energy and nonthermal electron energy released

two seismic emission sources S1 and S2 both lying in the penumbral regions.

This is somewhat surprising because the spanning ratio of the

lateral components of the force are examined for different values of amplitude
and wavelength of the roughness and at different temperatures. The lateral
force is controlled by the local slope of the wall while the perpendicular

proposes a magnetic gradient pumping (MGP) mechanism and try to explain the
formation of hot plasma upflows, such as the hot type II spicules and hot
plasma ejections, etc. In MGP mechanism, the magnetic gradients drive the
energetic particles to move upwards from the underlying solar atmosphere and
form hot upflows. These upflow energetic particles deposit in corona and make
it becoming very hot. Roughly estimations indicate that the solar corona can be
heated to above 1 million degrees, and the upflow velocity is about 40 km/s in
chromosphere and about 130 km/s in the corona. The solar magnetic flux tubes
act as pumpers to extract energetic particles from the underlying thermal
photosphere, convey them and deposit in the corona. The deposition of energetic
particles will make the corona become hot, and their escaping from the
photosphere will make the underlying photosphere a bit cold. This mechanism
present a natural explanation to the mystery of solar coronal heating.

chromosphere. These small-scale jets originate from a compact bright-point-like
structure of $\sim$1.5"" size as seen in the IRIS 1330 \AA\ images. SDO/AIA and
SDO/HMI co-observations show that the EE lies in the footpoint of a complex
loop-like brightening system. The EE is detected in the higher temperature
channels of AIA 171 \AA, 193 \AA\ and 131 \AA\ suggesting that it reaches a
higher temperature of log T$=5.36\pm0.06$ (K). Brightenings observed in the AIA

ejections seen in the chromosphere. The wings of the C II line behave in a

the Mg II k wings show additional Doppler-shifted emission. Magnetic
convergence or emergence followed by cancellation at a rate of $5\times10^{14}$

that have not been explicitly studied before, such as the impact of
initialization and parameter setting, convergence, and scalability. We provide
an experimental framework for extensively comparing the methods in a wide range
of truth discovery scenarios where source coverage, numbers and distributions
of conflicts, and true positive claims can be controlled and used to evaluate
the quality and performance of the algorithms. Finally, we report comprehensive

Here we use a previously developed data-driven fish school model to investigate
how a single or a small number of perturbing individuals affect the long-term

general as it does not invoke any specific dynamical model, and can provide

L1/2 Regularized Sparse Representation using Hierarchical Feature Selection

and dimension of global dictionary, which directly contributes to the decrease
of computational cost in sparse representation that our approach is strongly
rooted in. It consists of Gabor wavelets and Extreme Learning Machine
Auto-Encoder (ELM-AE) hierarchically. For Gabor wavelets part, local features
can be extracted at multiple scales and orientations to form Gabor-feature
based image, which in turn improves the recognition rate. Besides, in the
presence of occluded face image, the scale of Gabor-feature based global
dictionary can be compressed accordingly because redundancies exist in
Gabor-feature based occlusion dictionary. For ELM-AE part, the dimension of
Gabor-feature based global dictionary can be compressed because
high-dimensional face images can be rapidly represented by low-dimensional
feature. By introducing L1/2 regularization, our approach can produce sparser
and more robust representation compared to regularized Sparse Representation
based Classification (SRC), which also contributes to the decrease of the
computational cost in sparse representation. In comparison with related work
such as SRC and Gabor-feature based SRC (GSRC), experimental results on a
variety of face databases demonstrate the great advantage of our method for
computational cost. Moreover, we also achieve approximate or even better
recognition rate.

of our Galaxy, with XMM-Newton with a total exposure of ~226 ks in coordination
with the 1.3 mm VLBI. We have performed timing analysis of the X-ray emission
from Sgr A* using Bayesian blocks algorithm to detect X-ray flares observed
with XMM-Newton. Furthermore, we computed X-ray smoothed light curves observed
in this campaign in order to have better accuracy on the position and the
amplitude of the flares. We detected 2 X-ray flares on the 2011 March 30 and
April 3 which have for comparison a peak detection level of 6.8 and 5.9 sigma
in the XMM-Newton/EPIC light curve in the 2-10 keV energy range with a 300 s
bin. The former is characterized by 2 sub-flares: the first one is very short
(~458 s) with a peak luminosity of ~9.4E34 erg/s whereas the second one is
longer (~1542 s) with a lower peak luminosity of ~6.8E34 erg/s. The comparison
with the sample of X-ray flares detected during the 2012 Chandra XVP campaign
favors the hypothesis that the 2011 March 30 flare is a single flare rather
than 2 distinct sub-flares. We model the light curve of this flare with the
gravitational lensing of a simple hotspot-like structure but we can not
satisfactorily reproduce the large decay of the light curve between the 2
sub-flares with this model. From magnetic energy heating during the rise phase
of the first sub-flare and assuming an X-ray photons production efficiency of 1
and a magnetic field of 100 G at 2 r_g, we derive an upper limit to the radial
distance of the first sub-flare of 100 r_g. We estimate using the decay phase
of the first sub-flare a lower limit to the radial distance of 4 r_g from
synchrotron cooling in the infrared. The X-ray emitting region of the first
sub-flare is located at a radial position of 4-100 and has a corresponding
radius of 1.8-2.87 in r_g unit for a magnetic field of 100 G at 2 r_g.

funnelled by the field to relatively small regions close to the magnetic poles
of the neutron star (NS), the hotspots. During strong outbursts regularly
observed from some X-ray pulsars, the X-ray luminosity can be so high, that the
emerging radiation is able to stop the accreting matter above the surface via
radiation-dominated shock, and the accretion column begins to rise. This border
luminosity is usually called the ""critical luminosity"". Here we calculate the
critical luminosity as a function of the NS magnetic field strength $B$ using
exact Compton scattering cross section in strong magnetic field. Influence of
the resonant scattering and photon polarization is taken into account for the
first time. We show that the critical luminosity is not a monotonic function of
the B-field. It reaches a minimum of a few 10^{36} erg s^{-1} when the
cyclotron energy is about 10 keV and a considerable amount of photons from a
hotspot have energy close to the cyclotron resonance. For small B, this
luminosity is about 10^{37} erg s^{-1}, nearly independent of the parameters.
It grows for the B-field in excess of 10^{12} G because of the drop in the
effective cross-section of interaction below the cyclotron energy. We
investigate how different types of the accretion flow and geometries of the
accretion channel affect the results and demonstrate that the general behaviour
of the critical luminosity on B-field is very robust. The obtained results are
shown to be in a good agreement with the available observational data and
provide a necessary ground for the interpretation of upcoming high quality data
from the currently operating and planned X-ray telescopes.

Ratio (IPR) for the topological charge density ($q(x)$) in SU(3) Lattice
Yang-Mills theory for relatively small lattice spacings including some smaller
than those explored before. With the help of recently proposed open boundary
condition, it is possible to compute observables at a smaller lattice spacing
since {\em trapping problem} is absent. On the other hand, the reference energy
scale provided by Wilson flow allows us to study their scaling behavior in
contrast to previously proposed smearing techniques. The behavior of TCDC for
different lattice spacings at a fixed HYP smearing level shows apparent scaling
violations. In contrast, at a particular Wilson flow time $t$ for all the
lattice spacings investigated (except the largest one), the TCDC data show
universal behavior within our statistical uncertainties. The continuum
properties of TCDC are studied by investigating the small flow time behavior.
We have also extracted the pseudoscalar glueball mass from TCDC, which appears
to be insensitive to the lattice spacings (0.0345 fm $\leq a\leq$ 0.0667 fm)
and agrees with the value extracted using anisotropic lattices, within
statistical errors. Further, we have studied the localization property of
$q(x)$ through IPR whose continuum behavior can be probed through the small
values of Wilson flow time and observed the decrease of IPR with decreasing
Wilson flow time. A detailed study of $q(x)$ under Wilson flow time revealed
that as Wilson flow time decreases, the proximity of the regions of positive
and negative charge densities of large magnitudes increases, and the charge
density appears to be more delocalized resulting in the observed behavior of
IPR.

generality in a beautiful piece of work by Callen and Welton (in
1950s\cite{cw}). However Callen-Welton's formalism has not been extended to
nonlinear systems up to now, although alternative methods exist (like Kubo's
approach) that leads to formal and implicit expressions {\it at nonlinear

conjecture ""a non-linear Nyquist theorem"". This is an explicit formula much
like Nyquist's original one. Our conjecture is based upon tests of the
conjectured explicit formula in specific systems. We conjecture that higher
moments of {\it equilibrium} fluctuations bear a relation to {\it nonlinear}

nonlinear admittance from the character of {\it equilibrium} fluctuations. Our

through the optical band, late central engine optical/X-ray flares, interaction
between the expanding blast wave and a density enhancement in the circumburst
medium and gravitational microlensing. Instead we conclude that the achromatic
rebrightening may be caused by a refreshed forward shock or a geometrical
effect. In addition, we identify an additional component after the end of the

below and cooled from above, is used to analyze the transition to the
geostrophic regime of thermal convection. In the geostrophic regime, which is
of direct relevance to most geo- and astrophysical flows, the system is
strongly rotated while maintaining a sufficiently large thermal driving to
generate turbulence. We directly simulate the Navier--Stokes equations for two
values of the thermal forcing, i.e. $Ra=10^{10}$ and $Ra=5\cdot10^{10}$, a
constant Prandtl number~$Pr=1$, and vary the Ekman number in the range
$Ek=1.3\cdot10^{-7}$ to $Ek=2\cdot10^{-6}$ which satisfies both requirements of
super-criticality and strong rotation. We focus on the differences between the
application of no-slip vs. stress-free boundary conditions on the horizontal
plates. The transition is found at roughly the same parameter values for both
boundary conditions, i.e. at~$Ek\approx 9\times 10^{-7}$ for~$Ra=1\times
10^{10}$ and at~$Ek\approx 3\times 10^{-7}$ for~$Ra=5\times 10^{10}$. However,
the transition is gradual and it does not exactly coincide in~$Ek$ for
different flow indicators. In particular, we report the characteristics of the
transitions in the heat transfer scaling laws, the boundary-layer thicknesses,
the bulk/boundary-layer distribution of dissipations and the mean temperature
gradient in the bulk. The flow phenomenology in the geostrophic regime evolves
differently for no-slip and stress-free plates. For stress-free conditions the
formation of a large-scale barotropic vortex with associated inverse energy
cascade is apparent. For no-slip plates, a turbulent state without large-scale
coherent structures is found; the absence of large-scale structure formation is
reflected in the energy transfer in the sense that the inverse cascade, present
for stress-free boundary conditions, vanishes.

  CompleNet 2015",,,,"cs.SI physics.soc-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Centrality measures, erstwhile popular amongst the sociologists and
psychologists, have seen broad and increasing applications across several
disciplines of late. Amongst a plethora of application specific definitions
available in the literature to rank the vertices, closeness centrality,
betweenness centrality and eigenvector centrality (page-rank) have been the
most important and widely applied ones. Networks where information, signal or
commodities are flowing on the edges, surrounds us. Betweenness centrality
comes as a handy tool to analyze such systems, but betweenness computation is a
daunting task in large size networks. In this paper, we propose an efficient
heuristic to determine the betweenness-ordering of $k$ vertices (where $k$ is
very less than the total number of vertices) without computing their exact
betweenness indices. The algorithm is based on a non-uniform node sampling
model which is developed based on the analysis of Erdos-Renyi graphs. We apply
our approach to find the betweenness-ordering of vertices in several synthetic
and real-world graphs. The proposed heuristic results very efficient ordering
even when runs for a linear time in the terms of the number of edges. We
compare our method with the available techniques in the literature and show
that our method produces more efficient ordering than the currently known
methods.

the contribution of water to the oxygen budget by observing and modelling water
gas and ice for a sample of eleven low-mass protostars, for which both forms of
water have been observed.
  Methods: A simplified chemistry network, which is benchmarked against more
sophisticated chemical networks, is developed that includes the necessary
ingredients to determine the water vapour and ice abundance profiles in the
cold, outer envelope in which the temperature increases towards the protostar.
Comparing the results from this chemical network to observations of water
emission lines and previously published water ice column densities, allows us
to probe the influence of various agents (e.g., FUV field, initial abundances,
timescales, and kinematics).
  Results: The observed water ice abundances with respect to hydrogen nuclei in
our sample are 30-80ppm, and therefore contain only 10-30% of the volatile
oxygen budget of 320ppm. The keys to reproduce this result are a low initial
water ice abundance after the pre-collapse phase together with the fact that
atomic oxygen cannot freeze-out and form water ice in regions with T(dust)>15
K. This requires short prestellar core lifetimes of less than about 0.1Myr. The
water vapour profile is shaped through the interplay of FUV photodesorption,
photodissociation, and freeze-out. The water vapour line profiles are an
invaluable tracer for the FUV photon flux and envelope kinematics.
  Conclusions: The finding that only a fraction of the oxygen budget is locked
in water ice can be explained either by a short pre-collapse time of less than
0.1 Myr at densities of n(H)~1e4 cm-3, or by some other process that resets the
initial water ice abundance for the post-collapse phase. A key for the
understanding of the water ice abundance is the binding energy of atomic oxygen
on ice.

perovskite absorbers is the possibility of tailoring their properties by
changing the elemental composition through the chemical precursors. In this
context, rational in silico design represents a powerful tool for mapping the
vast materials landscape and accelerating discovery. Here we show that the
optical band gap of metal-halide perovskites, a key design parameter for solar
cells, strongly correlates with a simple structural feature, the largest
metal-halide-metal bond angle. Using this descriptor we suggest continuous
tunability of the optical gap from the mid-infrared to the visible. Precise
band gap engineering is achieved by controlling the bond angles through the
steric size of the molecular cation. Based on these design principles we
predict novel low-gap perovskites for optimum photovoltaic efficiency, and we
demonstrate the concept of band gap modulation by synthesising and
characterising novel mixed-cation perovskites.

symmetrically to both quantum dots. For a continuum of phonon modes however,
also asymmetric couplings can be described with a Markovian master equation. We

enables transport spectroscopy of the phonon frequency and displays signatures
of Franck-Condon blockade. For infinite external bias but finite tunneling

therefore be scaled arbitrarily by using large-aperture crystals. The technique

dominant motion consists of elliptical Keplerian orbits. The model is a
generalization of the well known shearing sheet, and is suitable for both
analytical and computational studies of the local dynamics of eccentric discs.
It is spatially homogeneous in the horizontal dimensions but has a
time-dependent geometry that oscillates at the orbital frequency. We show how
certain averages of the stress tensor in the local model determine the
large-scale evolution of the shape and mass distribution of the disc. The
simplest solutions of the local model are laminar flows consisting of a
(generally nonlinear) vertical oscillation of the disc. Eccentric discs lack
vertical hydrostatic equilibrium because of the variation of the vertical
gravitational acceleration around the eccentric orbit, and in some cases
because of the divergence of the orbital velocity field associated with an
eccentricity gradient. We discuss the properties of the laminar solutions,
showing that they can exhibit extreme compressional behaviour for
eccentricities greater than about $0.5$, especially in discs that behave
isothermally. We also derive the linear evolutionary equations for an eccentric
disc that follow from the laminar flows in the absence of a shear viscosity. In

ultimately modify the global disc properties. We use a local model of an
eccentric disc, derived in a companion paper, to compute the nonlinear vertical

stability to locally axisymmetric disturbances for any disc eccentricity and
eccentricity gradient using a numerical Floquet method. In the limit of small
departures from a circular reference orbit, the instability of an isothermal
disc is explained analytically. We also study analytically the small-scale
instability of an eccentric neutrally stratified polytropic disc with any
polytropic index using a WKB approximation. We find that eccentric discs are
generically unstable to the parametric excitation of small-scale inertial
waves. The nonlinear evolution of these instabilities should be studied in
numerical simulations, where we expect them to lead to a decay of the disc
eccentricity and eccentricity gradient as well as to induce additional
transport and mixing. Our results highlight that it is essential to consider
the three-dimensional structure of eccentric discs, and their resulting
vertical oscillatory flows, in order to correctly capture their evolution.

obtained the mass-radius relation for a BEC star and proposed that the recently
discovered neutron stars with masses around 2$M_\odot$ are BEC stars. They
employed a barotropic equation of state (EOS), with one free parameter, that
was first found by Colpi, Wasserman, and Shapiro (CSW), to describe them and
derive stable equilibrium configurations of spinning BEC stars in General
Relativity. In this work we show that while it is true that BECs allow for
compact object masses as heavy as the heaviest observed ones, such stars cannot
simultaneously have radii that are small enough to be consistent with the
latest observations, in spite of the flexibility available in the EOS in the
form of the free parameter. In fact, our conclusion applies to any spinning
relativistic boson star that obeys the CSW EOS.

the contributions to the OIR flux of the irradiated accretion disc and a
non-thermal component. We show that the OIR non-thermal component appears
during the X-ray state transitions both during the rising and the decaying part
of the outburst at nearly the same X-ray hardness but at luminosities differing
by a factor of 3. The line marking the quenching/recovery of the non-thermal

line"" that marks the presence of the compact radio jet. The inferred spectral
shape and the evolution of the non-thermal component during the outburst,
however, are not consistent with the jet origin, but are naturally explained in
terms of the hybrid hot flow scenario, where non-thermal electrons emit
synchrotron radiation in the OIR band. This implies a close, possibly causal
connection between the presence of the hot flow and the compact jet. We find
that the non-thermal component is hardening during the hard state at the

body of research have revisited the relevance estimation of the users'
generated content. Most of the studies have stressed the multidimensional
nature of relevance and proved the effectiveness of combining the different
criteria that it embodies. Traditional relevance estimates combination methods
are often based on linear combination schemes. However, despite being
effective, those aggregation mechanisms are not effective in real-life
applications since they heavily rely on the non-realistic independence property
of the relevance dimensions. In this paper, we propose to tackle this issue
through the design of a novel fuzzy-based document ranking model. We also
propose an automated methodology to capture the importance of relevance
dimensions, as well as information about their interaction. This model, based
on the Choquet Integral, allows to optimize the aggregated documents relevance
scores using any target information retrieval relevance metric. Experiments
within the TREC Microblog task and a social personalized information retrieval
task highlighted that our model significantly outperforms a wide range of
state-of-the-art aggregation operators, as well as a representative learning to
rank methods.

Our aim is to find the origin of their large brightness variation. We employ
long-term phase-resolved multicolor photometry, mostly from automatic
telescopes, covering 42 yr for IL Hya, 28 yr for XX Tri, and 34 yr for DM UMa.
For one target, IL Hya, we present a new Doppler image from NSO data taken in
late 1996. Effective temperatures for our targets are determined from all
well-sampled observing epochs and are based on a V-I_C color-index calibration.
The effective temperature change between the extrema of the rotational
modulation for IL Hya and XX Tri is in the range 50-200 K. The bolometric flux
during maximum of the rotational modulation, i.e., the least spotted states,
varied by up to 39% in IL Hya and up to 54% in XX Tri over the course of our
observations. We emphasize that for IL Hya this is just about half of the total
luminosity variation that can be explained by the photospheric temperature
(spots/faculae) changes, while for XX Tri it is even about one third. The
long-term, 0.6 mag V-band variation of DM UMa is more difficult to explain
because little or no B-V color index change is observed on the same timescale.
Placing the three stars with their light and color variations into H-R
diagrams, we find that their overall luminosities are generally too low
compared to predictions from current evolutionary tracks. A change in the
stellar radius due to strong and variable magnetic fields during activity
cycles likely plays a role in explaining the anomalous brightness and
luminosity of our three targets. At least for IL Hya, a radius change of about
9% is suggested from m_bol and T_eff, and is supported by independent vsin(i)
measurements.

lifetime is responsible for the main loss of entanglement, the two effects
cannot be minimized independently of each other. Furthermore, we examine the

z~2.3 to robustly separate these populations. However, the MEx diagram fails to
identify all of the AGN identified in the BPT diagram, and the CEx diagram is
substantially contaminated at high redshift. We further show that AGN samples
selected using the BPT diagram have selection biases in terms of both host
stellar mass and stellar population, in that AGN in low mass and/or high
specific star formation rate galaxies are difficult to identify using the BPT
diagram. These selection biases become increasingly severe at high redshift,
such that optically-selected AGN samples at high redshift will necessarily be
incomplete. We also find that the gas in the narrow-line region appears to be
more enriched than gas in the host galaxy for at least some MOSDEF AGN.
However, AGN at z~2 are generally less enriched than local AGN with the same

X-ray flux resulting in varying irradiation of the outer parts of the accretion

sufficiently small ratio of the outer disc radius to the QPO period. We show
that, unlike in the case of the aperiodic variability, it is not possible to
obtain the optical QPO profiles from those observed in the X-rays through the
transfer function, because of different X-ray signals seen by the disc and by
the observer. We demonstrate that with the increasing QPO frequency, occurring
at the rising phase of the X-ray outburst, the rms should be constant for
sufficiently low frequencies, then to increase reaching the peak and finally to
drop substantially when the QPO period becomes comparable to the light-crossing
time to the outer disc. We predict that the QPO rms in this model should
increase towards shorter wavelengths and this fact can be used to distinguish
it from other QPO mechanisms.

scheme to decide if the gas in which a sink could potentially form, is indeed
gravitationally bound and rapidly collapsing. This is achieved using a general

detail all the necessary steps to follow the evolution of sink particles in
turbulent molecular cloud simulations, such as sink production, their
trajectory integration, sink merging and finally the gas accretion rate onto an
existing sink. We compare our new recipe for sink formation to other popular

of trivial and cyclotomic characters lies in a family of eigenforms whose local
Galois representation at $\l$ is generically (a twist of) a ramified extension
of trivial by cyclotomic.
  We give some explicit examples of $p$-adic automorphic forms to which our
results apply, and give a general family of examples whose existence would
follow from counterexamples to the Leopoldt conjecture for totally real fields.

able to reproduce the lattice results of the thermodynamic quantities in the

review the basic ideas of the construction of these models and propose a new

our new model is in good agreement with the lattice simulations as the previous
ones, while in higher temperature region, it reproduces the upward trend of the
rescaled trace anomaly as found in lattice which, however, can not be obtained

to the thermal effective potential which could be used to systematically
improve the matrix models at high temperatures. In particular, we provide, for
the first time, an analytical proof of the relation between the one- and

one-loop result, independent of the eigenvalues of the Polyakov loop. This is a
very general result, we prove it for all classic groups, including $SU(N)$,

be derived from an algebra of Leibniz brackets of observables, the metriplectic
algebra, that extends the Poisson algebra of the zero viscosity limit via a
symmetric, semidefinite component. This metric bracket generates dissipative
forces.
  The metriplectic algebra includes the conserved total Hamiltonian $H$,
generating the non-dissipative part of dynamics, and the entropy $S$ of those
microscopic degrees of freedom draining energy irreversibly, that generates
dissipation. This $S$ is a Casimir of the Poisson algebra to which the
metriplectic algebra reduces in the frictionless limit.
  In the present paper, the metriplectic framework for viscous fluids is
re-written in the Lagrangian Formulation, where the system is described through
material variables: this is a way to describe the continuum much closer to the
discrete system dynamics than the Eulerian fields. Accordingly, the full
metriplectic algebra is constructed in material variables, and this will render
it possible to apply it in all those cases in which the Lagrangian Formulation
is preferred.
  The role of the entropy $S$ of a metriplectic system is as paramount as that
of the Hamiltonian $H$, but this fact may be underestimated in the Eulerian
formulation because $S$ is not the only Casimir of the symplectic non-canonical
part of the algebra. Instead, when the dynamics of the non-ideal fluid is
written through the parcel variables of the Lagrangian formulation, the fact
that entropy is symplectically invariant appears to be more clearly related to
its dependence on the microscopic degrees of freedom of the fluid, that do not
participate at all to the symplectic canonical part of the algebra (which,
indeed, involves and evolves only the macroscopic degrees of freedom of the
fluid parcel).

(4PV=4x10^60 erg), there is no obvious counterpart to the cavity on the
opposite side of the cluster, which would be expected if it has formed due to
jets from the central AGN inflating bubbles. There is also no radio emission
associated with the cavity, and no metal enhancement or filaments between it
and the BCG, which are normally found for bubbles inflated by AGN which have
risen from the core. One possibility is that this is an old ghost cavity, and
that gas sloshing has dominated the distribution of metals around the core.
Projection effects, particularly the long X-ray bright filament to the south
east, may prevent us from seeing the companion bubble on the opposite side of
the cluster core. We calculate that such a companion bubble would easily have
been able to uplift the gas in the southern filament from the core.
Interestingly, it has recently been found that inside the cavity is a highly
variable X-ray point source coincident with a small dwarf galaxy. Given the
remarkable spatial correlation of this point source and the X-ray cavity, we
explore the possibility that an outburst from this dwarf galaxy in the past
could have led to the formation of the cavity, but find this to be an unlikely

at current and high luminosity LHC running. To this end, we perform an
analytical expansion of the amplitude in terms of flavour changing squark mass
insertions that treats both cases of hierarchical and degenerate squark masses
in a unified way. We identify two enhanced effects allowed by various
constraints: one from holomorphic trilinear soft SUSY breaking terms and/or
right handed up squark mass insertions and another from non-holomorphic
trilinear soft SUSY breaking terms and light Higgs boson masses. Interestingly,
even with $\mathcal{O}(1)$ flavour violating effects in the, presently
unconstrained, up-squark sector, SUSY effects on $Br(t\to q h)$ come out to be
unobservable at LHC mainly due to leading order cancellations between penguin
and self energy diagrams and the constraints from charge- and colour-breaking
minima (CCB) of the MSSM vacuum. An exception to this conclusion may be effects
arising from non-holomorphic soft SUSY breaking terms in the region where the
CP-odd Higgs mass is smaller than the top-quark mass but this scenario is
disfavoured by recent LHC searches. Our calculations for $t\to q h$ decay are

(exposure times of 420 ks EPIC-pn, 556 ks EPIC-MOS1, 614 ks EPIC-MOS2) were
used to characterise the thermal X-ray emission in the region. An analysis of
the non-thermal X-rays is also presented and discussed in the context of

be associated with a new supernova remnant, MCSNR J0536-6913. X-ray spectral
analysis of MCSNR J0536-6913 suggested an ejecta-dominated remnant with lines
of O, Ne, Mg, and Si, and a total 0.3-10 keV luminosity of ~8E+34 erg/s. Based
on derived ejecta abundance ratios, we determined the mass of the stellar
progenitor to be either ~18 M_sun or as high as >40 M_sun, though the spectral
fits were subject to assumptions (e.g., uniform temperature and well-mixed
ejecta). The thermal emission from the SB exhibited enrichment by alpha-process
elements, evidence for a recent core-collapse SNR interaction with the SB
shell. We detected non-thermal X-ray emission throughout 30 Dor C, with the
brightest regions being highly correlated with the H-alpha and radio shells. We
created a non-thermal spectral energy distribution for the north-eastern shell
of 30 Dor C which was best-fit with an exponentially cut-off synchrotron model.
Conclusions: Thermal X-ray emission from 30 Dor C is very complex, consisting
of a large scale SB emission at the eastern shell wall with the brightest
emission due to MCSNR J0536-6913. The fact that the non-thermal spectral energy
distribution of the SB shell was observed to roll-off is further evidence that
the non-thermal X-rays from 30 Dor C are synchrotron in origin.

objects located at a local site according to a quality criterion reflecting
their suitability to serve as local representatives. Then we send the best of
these representatives to a server site where they are clustered with a slightly
enhanced density-based clustering algorithm. This approach is very efficient,
because the local detemination of suitable representatives can be carried out
quickly and independently from each other. Furthermore, based on the scalable
number of the most suitable local representatives, the global clustering can be
done very effectively and efficiently. In our experimental evaluation, we will
show that our new scalable density-based distributed clustering approach
results in high quality clusterings with scalable transmission cost.

Chute-operated dropsondes jointly developed by NASA and NCAR are capable of

paper proposes a chute-free vertical retardation technique (termed as
spinsonde) that can accurately measure vertical wind profile. Unlike the
expendable dropsondes, the spinsonde allows multi-cycle measurement to be
performed within a single flight. Proof of principle is demonstrated using a
simulation software and results indicate that the GPS ground speed correlates
with the wind speeds to within +/-5 km/h. This technique reduces flying weight
and increases payload capacity by eliminating bulky chutes. Maximum cruising

new observations towards the prestellar core L1544. They are based on an
unbiased spectral survey of the 3mm band at the IRAM-30m telescope, as part of
the Large Program ASAI. The observations allow us to provide the full census of
the oxygen bearing COMs in this source. We detected tricarbon monoxide,
methanol, acetaldehyde, formic acid, ketene, and propyne with abundances
varying from 5e-11 to 6e-9. The non-LTE analysis of the methanol lines shows
that they are likely emitted at the border of the core, at a radius of ~8000 AU
where T~10 K and nH2~2e4 cm-3. Previous works have shown that water vapour is
enhanced in the same region because of the photodesorption of water ices. We
propose that a non-thermal desorption mechanism is also responsible for the
observed emission of methanol and COMs from the same layer. The desorbed oxygen
and a tiny amount of desorbed methanol and ethene are enough to reproduce the
abundances of tricarbon monoxide, methanol, acetaldehyde and ketene measured in
L1544. These new findings open the possibility that COMs in prestellar cores
originate in a similar outer layer rather than in the dense inner cores, as
previously assumed, and that their formation is driven by the non-thermally
desorbed species.

invariance is broken by a time-dependent cosmological background. In order to
explore more general scenarios, we consider the possibility that spatial

investigate the cosmological consequences of the breaking of spatial

provide a blue spectrum without violating the null energy condition, and
operators for scalar fluctuations that lead to non-conservation of the comoving
curvature perturbation on superhorizon scales even in single-clock inflation.
In the last part of our work, we also examine the consequences of operators
containing more than two spatial derivatives, discussing how they affect the
sound speed of tensor fluctuations, and showing that they can mimic some of the

parabolas which terminate to high binding energy with a clear band bottom.
Secondly, these states are sensitive to time-dependent changes of the YbB$_{6}$

systems to probe electric-field noise at MHz frequencies and over a distance

have reported spectral densities of electric-field noise inferred from ion
heating-rate measurements and several different theoretical explanations for
the observed noise characteristics have been proposed. This paper provides an
extensive summary and critical review of electric-field noise measurements in
ion traps, and compares these experimental findings with known and conjectured
mechanisms for the origin of this noise. This reveals that the presence of
multiple noise sources, as well as the different scalings added by geometrical

purpose of this review to assess which conclusions can be reasonably drawn from

define two many-body operators that connect each state in one sector with a

recently attracted much attention due to their capability in consolidating the
robustness of topological qubits and the universality of conventional qubits.
However, these two kinds of qubits are normally constructed in significantly
different energy scales, and thus this energy mismatch is a major obstacle for
their coupling that supports the exchange of quantum information between them.
Here, we propose a microwave photonic quantum bus for a direct strong coupling
between the topological and conventional qubits, in which the energy mismatch
is compensated by the external driving field via the fractional ac Josephson
effect. In the framework of tight-binding simulation and perturbation theory,
we show that the energy splitting of the topological qubits in a finite length
nanowire is still robust against local perturbations, which is ensured not only
by topology, but also by the particle-hole symmetry. Therefore, the present
scheme realizes a robust interface between the flying and topological qubits.
Finally, we demonstrate that this quantum bus can also be used to generate
multipartitie entangled states with the topological qubits.

factorization. Data for proton and deuteron targets by HERMES and COMPASS allow
for a flavor separation of the valence components of transversity, while
di-hadron fragmentation functions are taken from the semi-inclusive production
of two pion pairs in back-to-back jets in $e^+ e^-$ annihilation. The latter
data from Belle have been reanalyzed using the replica method and a more
realistic estimate of the uncertainties on the chiral-odd interference
fragmentation function has been obtained. After encoding this piece of

has been re-extracted by using the most recent and more precise COMPASS data
for proton target. This picture represents the current most realistic estimate

code, and are based on software development process models that support
iterative, incremental development of software. Although agile methods have
existed for a number of years now, answers to questions concerning the
suitability of agile processes to particular software development environments
are still often based on anecdotal accounts of experiences. An appreciation of
the (often unstated) assumptions underlying agile processes can lead to a
better understanding of the applicability of agile processes to particular
situations. Agile processes are less likely to be applicable in situations in
which core assumptions do not hold. This paper examines the principles and
advocated practices of agile processes to identify underlying assumptions. The
paper also identifies limitations that may arise from these assumptions and
outlines how the limitations can be addresses by incorporating other software
development techniques and practices into agile development environments.

have been proposed and explored in recent years, there has been little work on

hard to assess new model transformation approaches such as the upcoming OMG

increased understanding of the relative merits of different model

superconductors, are derived from chemical doping or application of pressure on
their collinearly magnetic-ordered parent compounds[1-5]. The recently
discovered pressure-induced superconductor CrAs, as a rare example of a
non-collinear helimagnetic superconductor, has therefore generated great
interest in understanding microscopic magnetic properties and their interplay
with superconductivity [6-8]. Unlike cuprates and iron based superconductors
where the magnetic moment direction barely changes upon doping, here we show
that CrAs exhibits a spin reorientation from the ab plane to the ac plane,
along with an abrupt drop of the magnetic propagation vector at a critical
pressure (Pc~0.6 GPa). This magnetic phase transition coincides with the
emergence of bulk superconductivity, indicating a direct connection between
magnetism and superconductivity. With further increasing pressure, the magnetic
order completely disappears near the optimal Tc regime (P~0.94 GPa). Moreover,
the Cr magnetic moments between nearest neighbors tend to be aligned
antiparallel with increasing pressure toward the optimal superconductivity
regime. Our findings suggest that the non-collinear helimagnetic order is
strongly coupled to structural and electronic degrees of freedom, and that
antiferromagnetic correlations associated with the low magnetic vector phase
are crucial for superconductivity.

$\mathcal{H}$ of a t-structure in a triangulated category $\mathcal{D}$ is a
Grothendieck or a module category. As preliminaries, we study Grothendieck
conditions AB3-AB5 for $\mathcal{H}$ in a very general setting. We then
concentrate on two familiar examples of smashing t-structures. First, we
consider that $\mathcal{D}=\mathcal{D}(\mathcal{G})$ is the (unbounded) derived
category of a Grothendieck category $\mathcal{G}$ and that the t-structure is
the one associated to a torsion pair $\mathbf{t}=(\mathcal{T},\mathcal{F})$ in
$\mathcal{G}$, usually known as Happel-Reiten-Smal$\emptyset$ t-structure. In
the second example studied, we assume that $\mathcal{D}=\mathcal{D}(R)$ is the
derived category of a commutative Noetherian ring $R$ and that the t-structure
is compactly generated. On what concern the Happel-Reiten-Smal$\emptyset$
example, we show that if $\mathcal{H}=\mathcal{H}_\mathbf{t}$ is AB5, then
$\mathcal{F}$ is closed under taking direct limits in $\mathcal{G}$. Moreover,
the converse is true, even implying that $\mathcal{H}_\mathbf{t}$ is a
Grothendieck category, for a wide class of torsion pairs in $\mathcal{G}$ which
includes the hereditary, tilting and cotilting ones. When
$\mathcal{G}=R-\text{Mod}$ is a module category, we are able to identify the
hereditary torsion pairs $\mathbf{t}$ in $R-\text{Mod}$ for which
$\mathcal{H}_\mathbf{t}$ is a module category. When $R$ is a commutative
noetherian ring, we show that all compactly generated t-structures in
$\mathcal{D}(R)$ whose associated filtration by supports is left bounded have a
heart $\mathcal{H}$ which is a Grothendieck category. This is used to identify
all compactly generated t-structures in $\mathcal{D}(R)$ whose heart is a
module category.

identify topology changes in power networks using readings from
sparsely-deployed phasor measurement units (PMUs). When a power line, load, or
generator trips in a network, or when a substation is reconfigured, the event
leaves a unique ""voltage fingerprint"" of bus voltage changes that we can
identify using only the portion of the network directly observed by the PMUs.
The naive brute-force approach to identify a failed line from such voltage
fingerprints, though simple and accurate, is slow. We derive an approximate
algorithm based on a local linearization and a novel filtering approach that is
faster and only slightly less accurate. We present experimental results using
the IEEE 57-bus, IEEE 118-bus, and Polish 1999-2000 winter peak networks.

theoretical model described in [21], but extend it so that it reflects actually
traded electricity contracts, transaction costs and liquidity considerations.
Our numerical simulations examine the properties of the term structure and its
dependence on various parameters of the model. The proposed quadratic
programming formulation is applied to calculate the equilibrium term structure
of electricity prices in the UK power grid consisting of a few hundred power
plants. The impact of ramp up and ramp down constraints are also studied.

The discipline of systems engineering knows it as approach of incremental

well known methods of reorganizing companies, namely, the holistic approach,
the incremental approach, and the hierarchical approach. We show similarities
between software engineering methods and company reorganizationprocesses. In

and stored electrical energy in a capacitor. Using NI-PXI workstation with a
LabVIEW programming, the output voltage of the piezo strip and voltage of the

outside the containment wall of and underneath the Koeberg nuclear power plant
near Cape Town, South Africa. Antineutrino fluxes ranged from ~5*10^11 to
1.6*10^13 cm^-2 s^-1 during this period. We show that the coincidence summing
technique provides a sensitive tool to measure a change in the total decay
constant as well as the branching ratio between EC and beta+ decay of 22Na to
the first excited state in 22Ne. We observe a relative change in count rate
between reactor-ON and reactor-OFF equal to (-0.51+/-0.11)*10^-4. After
evaluating possible systematic uncertainties we conclude that the effect is
either due to a hidden instrumental cause or due to an interaction between
antineutrinos and the 22Na nucleus. An upper limit of ~0.03 barn has been
deduced for observing any change in the decay rate of 22Na due to antineutrino
interactions.

(CMC) surfaces in a three dimensional Riemannian space form to the associated

Via the canonical formal Killing field, considered as an infinitely prolonged

assembly of a pair of Adler-Kostant-Symes bi-Hamiltonian hierarchies to the
original CMC system. The infinite sequence of higher-order conservation laws of
the CMC system admits the corresponding extension, and we find a formula for
the generating series of the representative 1-forms. We also introduce a class
of generalized (complexified) CMC surfaces as the phase space of the CMC
hierarchy.
