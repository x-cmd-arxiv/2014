numerically using the idea of data-collapse. As the WPSL is a space-filling
cellular structure, we thought it was worth checking if the Lewis and the
Aboav-Weaire laws are obeyed in the WPSL. To this end, we find that the mean
area $<A>_k$ of blocks with $k$ neighbours grow linearly up to $k=8$, and hence
the Lewis law is obeyed. However, beyond $k>8$ we find that $<A>_k$ grows
exponentially to a constant value violating the Lewis law. On the other hand,
we show that the Aboav-Weaire law is violated for the entire range of $k$.
Instead, we find that the mean number of neighbours of a block adjacent to a

  $k$ neighbours is approximately equal to six, independent of $k$.

detect the presence of active primary users. A large number of applications
demand for more comprehensive knowledge on primary user behaviors in spatial,
temporal, and frequency domains. To satisfy such requirements, we study the
statistical relationship among primary users by introducing a Bayesian network
(BN) based framework. How to learn such a BN structure is a long standing
issue, not fully understood even in the statistical learning community.
Besides, another key problem in this learning scenario is that the CR has to
identify how many variables are in the BN, which is usually considered as prior
knowledge in statistical learning applications. To solve such two issues
simultaneously, this paper proposes a BN structure learning scheme consisting
of an efficient structure learning algorithm and a blind variable
identification scheme. The proposed approach incurs significantly lower
computational complexity compared with previous ones, and is capable of
determining the structure without assuming much prior knowledge about
variables. With this result, cognitive users could efficiently understand the
statistical pattern of primary networks, such that more efficient cognitive
protocols could be designed across different network layers.

comparison with those of an interface to a capping magnetic layer. In magnets,
an open surface often perturbs the magnetic order by a reconstruction of the
magnetic moment directions near the surface. On the other hand, in topological
insulators, it leads to the formation of topologically protected surface
states. These two contrasting effects may coexist in magnetic Chern insulators,
which give rise to nontrivial surface reconstruction. For instance, the chiral
edge current is largely enhanced by the edge reconstruction in a
two-dimensional magnetic Chern insulator realized in a quarter-filled Kondo
lattice model on a triangular lattice. We here show that the edge
reconstruction can be described semiquantitatively by a simple junction model
between the bulk topological magnetic state and a ferromagnetic capping layer.
We further clarify how the chiral edge current is affected by the magnetic
structure in the capping layer. Our results indicate that the topological edge
state can be controlled magnetically through the junctions.

having the coefficients set to be dependent on the rainfall index data. In
spite of the population dynamics of the \emph{Ae. aegypti} be mainly ruled by

control actions are also implemented in many periods of the year in order to
compare relative efficiency of public health policies. The analysis of
equilibrium and stability was performed. Field rainfall time series data from

their determination of the asymptotic phase of radial oscillations in evolved

helium-burning stars in the `red clump'. Here we provide a detailed analysis of
this relation, which is found to derive from differences between these two
classes of stars in the thermodynamic state of the convective envelope. There
is potential for distinguishing red giants and clump stars based on the phase
determined from observations that are too short to allow distinction based on
determination of the period spacing for mixed modes. The analysis of the phase

different situations: initial matter distributions that are homogeneous and
isotropic, and perturbations to those that respect the spherical symmetry. As
matter models we consider the case of a pressureless perfect fluid, i.e. dust,
and the case of a real massive scalar field oscillating around the minimum of
the potential. Both types of matter have been considered as possible dark
matter candidates in the cosmology literature, dust being closely related to
the standard cold dark matter paradigm. We confirm that in the linear regime
the perturbations associated with these types of matter grow in essentially the
same way, the main difference being that in the case of a scalar field the
dynamics introduce a cut-off in the power spectrum of the density perturbations
at scales comparable with the Compton wavelength of the field. We also follow
the evolutions well beyond the linear regime showing that both models are able
to form structure. In particular we find that, once in the nonlinear regime,
perturbations collapse faster in a universe dominated by dust. This is expected
to delay the formation of the first structures in the scalar field dark matter
scenario with respect to the standard cold dark matter one.

spatially-explicit information and modelling and their multiple sources of
uncertainty. Geospatial support is one of the forms of assistance frequently
required by emergency response centres along with hazard forecast and event
management assessment. Robust modelling of natural hazards requires dynamic
simulations under an array of multiple inputs from different sources.
Uncertainty is associated with meteorological forecast and calibration of the
model parameters. Software uncertainty also derives from the data
transformation models (D-TM) needed for predicting hazard behaviour and its
consequences. On the other hand, social contributions have recently been
recognized as valuable in raw-data collection and mapping efforts traditionally
dominated by professional organizations. Here an architecture overview is
proposed for adaptive and robust modelling of natural hazards, following the
Semantic Array Programming paradigm to also include the distributed array of
social contributors called Citizen Sensor in a semantically-enhanced strategy
for D-TM modelling. The modelling architecture proposes a multicriteria
approach for assessing the array of potential impacts with qualitative rapid
assessment methods based on a Partial Open Loop Feedback Control (POLFC) schema

difference of $\pi$ on orbiting the wire. This can be detected in response of
clean wires (whose Fermi level is tuned to the Dirac point) to the presence of
the Aharonov-Bohm flux. Specifically, at half-odd integer applied flux (in
units of $hc/e$), long wires undergo semimetal-semiconductor transitions
characterized by logarithmically divergent susceptibility. Associated with
these are oscillations of magnetization (persistent current) that vanish both
at integer and half-odd integer flux. Additionally wires of arbitrary aspect
ratio exhibit conductance maxima at half-odd integer applied flux and minima at
integer flux. For long wires the maxima are sharp with their height approaching
$e^{2}/h$. Short wires are characterized by a universal conductivity $e^{2}/\pi

monoxide reacts with water vapor to form carbon dioxide and hydrogen. It is an
important reaction industrially used in conjunction with steam reforming of
hydrocarbons for the production of high purity hydrogen. Grenoble et al
examined the roles of both active metals and metal oxide support on the
kinetics of the WGS reaction. They found out that the turn over numbers of
various Al2O3 supported transition metals decreased in the trend of Cu, Re, Co,
Ru, Ni, Pt, Os, Au, Fe, Pd, Rh, and Ir, which corresponds nicely to the
observed volcano shaped correlation between catalytic activities and respective
CO adsorption heat. This is a strong indication that CO gets activated on the
metal surface during the reaction and different metals have different
activation energies. The authors also observed that the turn over number of
Pt/Al2O3 was one order of magnitude higher than that of Pt/SiO2, indicating a
strong support effect, which the authors ascribed to the activation of H2O.

insight into its underlying structure and also potential functions? In this
paper, we introduce a new community detection algorithm, called Attractor,
which automatically spots the communities or groups in a network over time via
local dynamic interaction. The basic idea is to envision a network as a
dynamical system, and each agent interacts with its local partners. Instead of
investigating the node dynamics, we actually examine the change of ""distances""
among linked nodes. As time evolves, these distances will be shrunk or
stretched gradually based on their topological structures. Finally all
distances among linked nodes will converge into a stable pattern, and
communities can be intuitively identified. Thanks to the dynamic viewpoint of
community detection, Attractor has several potential attractive properties: (a)
Attractor provides an intuitive solution to analyze the community structure of
a network, and faithfully captures the natural communities (with high quality).
(b) Owing to its time complexity $O(|E|)$, Attractor allows finding communities
on large networks. (c) The small communities or anomalies, usually existing in
real-world networks, can be well pinpointed. (d) Attractor is easy to
parameterize, since there is no need to specify the number of clusters.
Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world networks further demonstrate
the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed approach.

time, and a duropolist is a monopolist in the market of a durable good. In
1972, Ronald Coase conjectured that a duropolist who lacks commitment power
cannot sell the good above the competitive price if the time between periods
approaches zero. Coase's counterintuitive conjecture was later proven by Gul et
al. (1986) under an infinite time horizon model with non-atomic consumers.
Remarkably, the situation changes dramatically for atomic consumers and an
infinite time horizon. Bagnoli et al. (1989) showed the existence of a
subgame-perfect Nash equilibrium where the duropolist extracts all the consumer
surplus. Observe that, in these cases, duropoly profits are either arbitrarily
smaller or arbitrarily larger than the corresponding static monopoly profits --
the profit a monopolist for an equivalent consumable good could generate. In
this paper we show that the result of Bagnoli et al. (1989) is in fact driven
by the infinite time horizon. Indeed, we prove that for finite time horizons
and atomic agents, in any equilibrium satisfying the standard skimming
property, duropoly profits are at most an additive factor more than static
monopoly profits. In particular, duropoly profits are always at least static
monopoly profits but never exceed twice the static monopoly profits.
  Finally we show that, for atomic consumers, equilibria may exist that do not
satisfy the skimming property. For two time periods, we prove that amongst all
equilibria that maximize duropoly profits, at least one of them satisfies the
skimming property. We conjecture that this is true for any number of time
period.

axis of each spectrum of the mapping data so that the zero corresponds to the
local mean velocity of 12CO spectra. The signal-to-noise ratios of the
resulting spectra are improved by a factor of up to 3.2 compared to those
obtained with normal stacking analysis. We successfully detect a weak 13CO
emission from the interarm region where the emission was not detected in the
individual pointings. We compare the integrated intensity ratios I12 CO/I13 CO
among six characteristic regions (center, bar, bar-end, offset, arm, and
interarm). We find that I12CO/I13CO in the bar and interarm are higher than
those in the other regions by a factor of ~2 and I12CO/I13CO in the center is
moderately high. These high I12CO/I13CO ratios in the bar and center are
attributed to a high intensity ratio (T12CO/T13CO) and one in the interarm is
attributed to a high ratio of the full width at half maximum of spectra
(FWHM12CO/FWHM13CO). The difference between FWHM12CO and FWHM13CO of the
interarm indicates the existence of two components, one with a narrow line
width (~FWHM13CO) and the other with a broad line width (~FWHM12CO).
Additionally, the T12CO/T13CO ratio in the broad-line-width component of the
interarm is higher than the other regions. The high T12CO/T13CO in the center
and bar and of the broad-line-width component in the interarm suggest the
existence of non-optically thick 12CO components. We find that more than half
of the 12CO emissions of the interarm are likely to be radiated from the
diffuse component. Our result suggests that the use of a universal CO-to-H2
conversion factor might lead to an overestimation of molecular gas mass and
underestimation of star-formation efficiency in the interarm by a factor of a
few.

destination. To better simulate the routing behavior of a packet, we thoroughly
explore the real-world Internet routes and present a novel local information
based simulation model, with a tuning parameter, which assigns weights to links
based on local information and then simulates the Internet route with weighted
shortest path. Comparisons with baseline approaches show its capability in well
replicating the route length distribution and other structural properties of
the Internet topology. Meanwhile, the optimal parameter of this model locates
in the range of (0, 2), which implies that a packet inside the Internet
inclines to move to nodes with small degrees. This behavior actually reflects
the design philosophy of Internet routing, balancing between network efficiency
and traffic congestion.

or molecules, one should stimulate as much emission and collect as many photons
as possible. That is, in this classical case, it has always been assumed that
the coherence time of the system should be made short, and that the statistical
scaling $\sim1/\sqrt{t}$ defines the resolution limit for imaging time $t$.
However, here we show in contrast that given the same resources, a long
coherence time permits a higher resolution image. In this quantum regime, we
give a procedure for determining the position of a single two-level system, and
demonstrate that the standard errors of our position estimates scale at the
Heisenberg limit as $\sim 1/t$, a quadratic, and notably optimal, improvement
over the classical case.

quasi-one-dimensional models, suitable for density-matrix renormalization group
(DMRG) calculations, from single- as well as multiple-impurity Anderson models
in any spatial dimensions. This new scheme, named BL-DMRG method, allows us to
calculate not only local but also spatially dependent static and dynamical
quantities of the ground state for general Anderson impurity models without
losing elaborate geometrical information of the lattice. We show that the
BL-DMRG method can be easily extended to treat a multi-orbital Anderson
impurity model. We also show that the symmetry adapted BL bases can be
utilized, when it is appropriate, to reduce the computational cost. As a
demonstration, we apply the BL-DMRG method to three different models for
graphene: (i) a single adatom on the honeycomb lattice, (ii) a substitutional
impurity in the honeycomb lattice, and (iii) an effective model for a single
carbon vacancy in graphene. Our analysis reveals that, for the particle-hole
symmetric case at half filling of electron density, the ground state of model
(i) behaves as an isolated magnetic impurity with no Kondo screening while the
ground state of the other two models forms a spin singlet state. We also
calculate the real-space dependence of the spin-spin correlation functions
between the impurity site and the conduction sites for these three models. Our
results clearly show that, reflecting the presence of absence of unscreened
magnetic moment at the impurity site, the spin-spin correlation functions decay
as $r^{-3}$, differently from the non-interacting limit ($r^{-2}$), for model
(i) and as $ r^{-4}$, exactly the same as the non-interacting limit, for models
(ii) and (iii) in the asymptotic $r$, where $r$ is the distance between the
impurity site and the conduction site.

universality class, we apply the functional renormalization group method to
describe thermodynamics near chiral crossover. Our studies are focused on the
influence of the momentum cuts on the critical behavior of different cumulants
of the net quark number fluctuations. We use the momentum scale dependence of
the flow equation to examine how the suppression of the momentum modes in the
infrared and ultraviolet regime modifies generic properties of fluctuations
expected in the O(4) universality class. We show, that the pion mass $m_\pi$ is
a natural soft momentum scale at which cumulants are saturated at their
critical values, whereas for scales larger than $2m_\pi$ the characteristic
O(4) structure of the higher order cumulants get lost. These results indicate,
that when measuring fluctuations of the net baryon number in heavy ion
collisions to search for a partial restoration of chiral symmetry or critical
point, a special care have to be made when introducing kinematical cuts on the
fluctuation measurements.

The marge mass ratios between fermions, confronted with a unique breaking

that they result from the overlap of fermion wave functions. Such overlaps vary
indeed very strongly if the observed fermion families in 4 dimensions originate
in a single family in 6 dimensions, through localized wave functions. This
framework leads in a natural way to large mass ratios and small mixing angles
between quarks. What came as a surprise is that if we impose that neutrinos
behave as 2-component (""Majorana"") particles in 4D, a completely different
situation is obtained for them. Instead of diagonal mass matrices,
anti-diagonal ones emerge and lead to a generic prediction of combined inverted
hierarchy, large mixing angles in the leptonic sector, and a suppression of
neutrinoless-double beta decay placing it at the lower limit of the inverted
hierarchy branch, a challenging situation for on-going and planned experiments.
Our approach predicted the size of the $\theta_{13}$ mixing angle before its
actual measurement. Possible signals at colliders are only briefly evoked.

applications that demand scalable and distributed solution methods. The study
of the convergence properties of these methods is in general difficult due to
the nonconvexity of the problem. In this paper, two distributed solution
methods that combine the fast convergence properties of augmented
Lagrangian-based methods with the separability properties of alternating
optimization are investigated. The first method is adapted from the classic
quadratic penalty function method and is called the Alternating Direction
Penalty Method (ADPM). Unlike the original quadratic penalty function method,
in which single-step optimizations are adopted, ADPM uses an alternating
optimization, which in turn makes it scalable. The second method is the
well-known Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM). It is shown that
ADPM for nonconvex problems asymptotically converges to a primal feasible point
under mild conditions and an additional condition ensuring that it
asymptotically reaches the standard first order necessary conditions for local
optimality are introduced. In the case of the ADMM, novel sufficient conditions
under which the algorithm asymptotically reaches the standard first order
necessary conditions are established. Based on this, complete convergence of
ADMM for a class of low dimensional problems are characterized. Finally, the
results are illustrated by applying ADPM and ADMM to a nonconvex localization
problem in wireless sensor networks.

a numerical tool for rational design of such structures is still missing. In
this work, a hybrid computational framework is presented, using a total
Lagrangian formulation of the Finite Element Method (FEM) to represent a
flexible barrier. The actions exerted on the structure by a debris flow are
obtained from simultaneous simulations of the flow of a fluid-grain mixture,
using two conveniently coupled solvers: the Discrete Element Method (DEM)
governs the motion of the grains, while the free-surface non-Newtonian fluid
phase is solved using the Lattice-Boltzmann Method (LBM). Simulations on
realistic geometries show the dependence of the momentum transfer on the
barrier on the composition of the debris flow, challenging typical assumptions
made during the design process today. In particular, we demonstrate that both
grains and fluid contribute in a non-negligible way to the momentum transfer.
Moreover, we show how the flexibility of the barrier reduces its vulnerability
to structural collapse, and how the stress is distributed on its fabric,
highlighting potential weak points.

  costs","arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:1409.3394",,,,"q-fin.MF","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The subject of this paper is an optimal consumption/optimal portfolio problem
with transaction costs and with multiple risky assets.
  In our model the transaction costs take a special form in that transaction
costs on purchases of one of the risky assets (the endowed asset) are infinite,
and transaction costs involving the other risky assets are zero. Effectively,
the endowed asset can only be sold. In general, multi-asset optional
consumption/optimal portfolio problems are very challenging, but the extra
structure we introduce allows us to make significant progress towards an
analytical solution.
  For an agent with CRRA utility we completely characterise the different types
of optimal behaviours. These include always selling the entire holdings of the
endowed asset immediately, selling the endowed asset whenever the ratio of the
value of the holdings of the endowed asset to other wealth gets above a
critical ratio, and selling the endowed asset only when other wealth is zero.
This characterisation is in terms of solutions of a boundary crossing problem
for a first order ODE. The technical contribution is to show that the problem
of solving the HJB equation, which is a second order, non-linear PDE subject to
smooth fit at an unknown free boundary, can be reduced to this much simpler
problem involving an explicit first order ODE. This technical contribution is
at the heart of our analytical and numerical results, and allows us to prove
monotonicity of the critical exercise threshold and the certainty equivalent
value in the model parameters.

of gauge field theories such as the Maxwell equations and the Yang-Mills

that if we assume that the middle components of the non-stationary solutions of
the Maxwell equations verify a Morawetz type estimate supported around the
trapped surface, then we can prove uniform decay properties for components of
the Maxwell fields in the entire exterior of the Schwarzschild black hole,
including the event horizon, by making only use of Sobolev inequalities
combined with energy estimates using the Maxwell equations directly. This proof
is entirely gauge independent, and does not pass through the scalar wave
equation on the Schwarzschild black hole, and does not need to separate the
middle components for the Maxwell fields. However, proving a Morawetz estimate
directly using the Maxwell equations, without refering to the scalar wave
equation, seems to be out of reach of the mathematical community as of today;
which I was not able to solve yet in this work. If one is able to prove the
Morawetz estimate directly using the Maxwell equations, this combined with the
present work would give full conceptual proof of decay of the Maxwell fields on
the Schwarzschild black hole, and would then be in particular useful for the
non-abelian case of the Yang-Mills equations where the separation of the middle

densification by vacancy annihilation removes an isolated pore site at a grain
boundary and collapses a column of sites extending from the vacancy to the
surface of sintering compact, through the center of mass of the nearest grain.
Using this algorithm, the existing published kMC models are shown to produce
anisotropic strains for homogeneous powder compacts with aspect ratios
different from unity. It is shown that the line direction biases shrinkage
strains in proportion the compact dimension aspect ratios. A new algorithm that
corrects this bias in strains is proposed; the direction for collapsing the
column is determined by choosing a random sample face and subsequently a random
point on that face as the end point for an annihilation path with equal
probabilities. This algorithm is mathematically and experimentally shown to
result in isotropic strains for all samples regardless of their dimensions.
Finally, the microstructural evolution is shown to be similar for the new and
old annihilation algorithms.

introducing a short-range depletion attraction between the ellipsoids,

experimental imperfections into account. We finally bound the amount of
randomness that can be extracted and compare it to the one obtained with the

detection efficiencies, it is far more efficient in terms of both the entropy

can be an alternative or complementary explanation to the wind model usually

originate from the wind illuminated by X-ray central source in LMXBs, we can
put constrains on the wind location only if we know the volume density number
of the absorbing material. There are a few derivations of the distance to the
wind in X-ray binaries. We show here, that the density number and the wind
location agree with the density of an upper disk atmosphere at optical depth of

channel. Previously, two transmission frameworks have been proposed for the DoF
analysis when $N \geq 2M$, where $M$ and $N$ denote the number of antennas at
each source node and the relay node respectively. The first method is named as
signal group based alignment proposed by Hua et al. in [1]. The second is named
as signal pattern approach introduced by Wang et al. in [2]. But both of them
only studied certain antenna configurations. The maximum achievable DoF in the
general case still remains unknown. In this work, we first derive a new upper
bound of the DoF using the genie-aided approach. Then, we propose a more
general transmission framework, generalized signal alignment (GSA), and show
that the previous two methods are both special cases of GSA. With GSA, we prove
that the new DoF upper bound is achievable when $\frac{N}{M} \in
\left(0,2+\frac{4}{K(K-1)}\right] \cup \left[K-2, +\infty\right)$. The DoF
analysis in this paper provides a major step forward towards the fundamental
capacity limit of the $K$-user MIMO Y channel. It also offers a new approach of
integrating interference alignment with physical layer network coding.

these clusters collapse to a HSS followed by a transition to IHSSs. We

solute transforms to droplets. In this paper, based on this process, we present
an investigation on droplet formation and their radial motion in a microfluidic
device in which a jet is injected in a co-flowing liquid stream. Thanks to the
laminar flow, the microfluidic setup enables studying diffusion mass transfer
in radial direction and obtaining well-defined concentration distributions.
Such profiles together with Ternary Phase Diagram (TPD) give detailed

their radial migration in the channel. The ternary system is composed of

obtain concentration profiles of the components. We show that in the system

binodal and the spinodal, i.e. via a thermally activated process. The droplets
are driven to the channel centerline by the solutal Marangoni effect but are
not able to significantly penetrate into the single-phase region, where they
get rapidly dissolved. Therefore, the radial motion of the binodal surface
carries the droplets to the centerline where they get collected.

stationary flowing quantum plasma at finite temperature is investigated. This
is a key quantity for thermodynamics and transport of dense plasmas in the warm
dense matter regime. This potential has been studied before within hydrodynamic
approaches or based on the zero temperature Lindhard dielectric function. Here
we extend the kinetic analysis by including the effects of finite temperature
and of collisions based on the Mermin dielectric function. The resulting ion
potential exhibits an oscillatory structure with attractive minima (wakes) and,
thus, strongly deviates from the static Yukawa potential of equilibrium
plasmas. This potential is analyzed in detail for high-density plasmas with
values of the Brueckner parameter in the range $0.1 \le r_s \le 1$, for a broad
range of plasma temperature and electron streaming velocity. It is shown that
wake effects become weaker with increasing temperature of the electrons.
Finally, we obtain the minimal electron streaming velocity for which attraction
between ions occurs. This velocity turns out to be less than the electron Fermi
velocity. Our results allow, for the first time, for reliable predictions of
the strength of wake effects in nonequilibrium quantum plasmas with fast
streaming electrons showing that these effects are crucial for transport under
warm dense matter conditions, in particular for laser-matter interaction,
electron-ion temperature equilibration and for stopping power.

expansion of gauge theories with and without supersymmetry. At tree level, the
BCFW recursion relations are analyzed with respect to their validity for
general off-shell objects in Yang-Mills theory, which is a significant step
away from their established zone of applicability. Unphysical poles constitute
a new potential problem in addition to the boundary behavior issue, common to
the on-shell case as well. For an infinite family of massive fermion currents,
both obstacles are shown to be avoided under the certain conditions, which
provides a natural recursion relation. At one loop, scattering amplitudes can
be calculated from unitarity cuts through their expansion into known scalar
integrals with free coefficients. A powerful method to obtain these
coefficients, namely spinor integration, is discussed and rederived in a
somewhat novel form. It is then used to compute analytically the infinite
series of one-loop gluon amplitudes in N = 1 super-Yang-Mills theory with
exactly three negative helicities. The final part of this thesis concerns the
intriguing relationship between gluon and graviton scattering amplitudes, which
involves a beautiful duality between the color and kinematic content of gauge
theories. This BCJ duality is extended to include particles in the fundamental
representation of the gauge group, which is shown to relieve the restriction of
the BCJ construction to factorizable gravities and thus give access to
amplitudes in generic (super-)gravity theories.

desired quantum state transitions and reaching a particular objective. An
accurate analysis of robustness is thus essential in understanding and
achieving model-based quantum control, such as in control of chemical reactions
based on ab initio or experimental estimates of the molecular Hamiltonian. In
this paper, theoretical foundations for quantum control robustness analysis are
presented from both a distributional perspective - in terms of moments of the
transition amplitude, interferences, and transition probability - and a
worst-case perspective. Based on this theory, analytical expressions and a
computationally efficient method for determining the robustness of coherently
controlled quantum dynamics are derived. The robustness analysis reveals that
there generally exists a set of control pathways that are more resistant to
destructive interferences in the presence of control field and system parameter
uncertainty. These robust pathways interfere and combine to yield a relatively
accurate transition amplitude and high transition probability when uncertainty
is present.

characterised by a prominent radio-optical-X-ray jet, was in a low gamma-ray
activity state during the first years of Fermi observations. Simultaneous
observations during the quiescent, outburst and post-flare gamma-ray states
were obtained by Swift, Planck and optical-IR-radio telescopes (INAOE, Catalina
CSS, VLBA, Metsahovi). The flare is observed from microwave to X-ray bands with
correlated variability and the Fermi, Swift and Planck data for this FSRQ show
some features more typical of BL Lac objects, like the synchrotron peak in the
optical band that outshines the thermal blue-bump emission, and the X-ray
spectral softening. Multi-epoch VLBA observations show the ejection of a new
component close in time with the GeV gamma-ray flare. The radio-to-gamma-ray
spectral energy distribution is modeled and fitted successfully for the
outburst and the post-flare epochs using either a single flaring blob with two
emission processes (synchrotron self Compton, and external-radiation Compton),
and a two-zone model with SSC-only mechanism.

(BC) featuring simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT),
where a multi-antenna access point (AP) delivers both information and energy
via radio signals to multiple single-antenna receivers simultaneously, and each
receiver implements either information decoding (ID) or energy harvesting (EH).
In particular, pseudo-random sequences that are {\it a priori} known and
therefore can be cancelled at each ID receiver is used as the energy signals,
and the information-theoretically optimal dirty paper coding (DPC) is employed
for the information transmission. We characterize the capacity region for ID
receivers under given energy requirements for EH receivers, by solving a
sequence of weighted sum-rate (WSR) maximization (WSRMax) problems subject to a
maximum sum-power constraint for the AP, and a set of minimum harvested power
constraints for individual EH receivers. The problem corresponds to a new form
of WSRMax problem in MISO-BC with combined maximum and minimum linear transmit
covariance constraints (MaxLTCCs and MinLTCCs), which differs from the
celebrated capacity region characterization problem for MISO-BC under a set of
MaxLTCCs only and is challenging to solve. By extending the general BC-multiple
access channel (MAC) duality, which is only applicable to WSRMax problems with
MaxLTCCs, and applying the ellipsoid method, we propose an efficient algorithm
to solve this problem globally optimally. Furthermore, we also propose two
suboptimal algorithms with lower complexity by assuming that the information
and energy signals are designed separately. Finally, numerical results are
provided to validate our proposed algorithms.

solving inverse problems characterized by a semi-linear structure, i.e. where
the data depend linearly on a subset of variables and nonlinearly on the
remaining ones. In this type of problems, under proper Gaussian assumptions one
can marginalize the linear variables. This means that the Monte Carlo procedure
needs only to be applied to the nonlinear variables, while the linear ones can
be treated analytically; as a result, the Monte Carlo variance and/or the
computational cost decrease. We use this approach to solve the inverse problem
of magnetoencephalography, with a multi-dipole model for the sources. Here,
data depend nonlinearly on the number of sources and their locations, and
depend linearly on their current vectors. The semi-analytic approach enables us
to estimate the number of dipoles and their location from a whole time-series,
rather than a single time point, while keeping a low computational cost.

physical conditions of the shocked region. We used the PACS and SPIRE
instruments on board the Herschel space observatory to map the full FIR
spectrum in a region covering the HH54 shock wave. Complementary Herschel-HIFI,
APEX, and Spitzer data are used in the analysis as well. The observed features
in the line profiles are reproduced using a 3D radiative transfer model of a
bow-shock, constructed with the Line Modeling Engine code (LIME). The FIR
emission is confined to the HH54 region and a coherent displacement of the
location of the emission maximum of CO with increasing J is observed. The peak
positions of the high-J CO lines are shifted upstream from the lower J CO lines
and coincide with the position of the spectral feature identified previously in
CO(10-9) profiles with HIFI. This indicates a hotter molecular component in the
upstream gas with distinct dynamics. The coherent displacement with increasing
J for CO is consistent with a scenario where IRAS12500-7658 is the exciting
source of the flow, and the 180 K bow-shock is accompanied by a hot (800 K)
molecular component located upstream from the apex of the shock and blueshifted
by -7 km s$^{-1}$. The spatial proximity of this knot to the peaks of the

of BL Lac objects that are hard to identify because they lack the unique
properties classifying them as such. While radio or X-ray surveys typically
reveal dozens of sources, recent compilations based on optical criteria alone
have increased the number of BL Lac candidates considerably. However, these
compilations are subject to biases and may contain a substantial number of
contaminating sources. \textbf{Aims.} In this paper we extend our analysis of
182 optically selected BL Lac object candidates from the SDSS with respect to
an earlier study. The main goal is to determine the number of bona fide BL Lac
objects in this sample. \textbf{Methods.} We examine their variability
characteristics, determine their broad-band radio-UV SEDs, and search for the
presence of a host galaxy. In addition we present new optical spectra for 27
targets with improved S/N with respect to the SDSS spectra. \textbf{Results.}
At least 59% of our targets have shown variability between SDSS DR2 and our
observations by more than 0.1-0.27 mag de- pending on the telescope used. A
host galaxy was detected in 36% of our targets. The host galaxy type and
luminosities are consistent with earlier studies of BL Lac host galaxies.
Simple fits to broad-band SEDS for 104 targets of our sample derived
synchrotron peak frequencies between $13.5 \leq
\mathrm{log}_{10}(\nu_{\mathrm{peak}}) \leq 16$ with a peak at
$\mathrm{log}_{10} \sim 14.5$. Our new optical spectra do not reveal any new
redshift for any of our objects. Thus the sample contains a large number of
bona fide BL Lac objects and seems to contain a substantial fraction of
intermediate-frequency peaked BL Lacs.

linear unmixing of hyperspectral images. Our contribution is twofold; first, we
propose a new Bayesian model for structured sparse regression in which the
supports of the sparse abundance vectors are a priori spatially correlated
across pixels (i.e., materials are spatially organised rather than randomly
distributed at a pixel level). This prior information is encoded in the model
through a truncated multivariate Ising Markov random field, which also takes
into consideration the facts that pixels cannot be empty (i.e, there is at
least one material present in each pixel), and that different materials may
exhibit different degrees of spatial regularity. Secondly, we propose an
advanced Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm to estimate the posterior
probabilities that materials are present or absent in each pixel, and,
conditionally to the maximum marginal a posteriori configuration of the
support, compute the MMSE estimates of the abundance vectors. A remarkable
property of this algorithm is that it self-adjusts the values of the parameters
of the Markov random field, thus relieving practitioners from setting
regularisation parameters by cross-validation. The performance of the proposed
methodology is finally demonstrated through a series of experiments with
synthetic and real data and comparisons with other algorithms from the
literature.

uses special families of finite element function spaces to mimic key

desirable physical properties related to balance and conservation. The method
relies on two novel features. The first is the use of compound finite elements
to provide suitable finite element spaces on general polygonal meshes. The
second is the use of dual finite element spaces on the dual of the original
mesh, along with suitably defined discrete Hodge star operators to map between
the primal and dual meshes, enabling the use of a finite volume scheme on the
dual mesh to compute potential vorticity fluxes. The resulting method has the
same mimetic properties as a finite volume method presented previously, but is
more accurate on a number of standard test cases.

SiII, SiIII, SiIV, FeII, and possibly SII. The total neutral hydrogen column
density is log N(HI) = 19.48 +/- 0.01. From measurements of column densities
and Doppler parameters we estimate element abundances of the above-given
elements. The overall metallicity, as traced by [OI/HI], is -1.56 +/- 0.01. For
the nitrogen-to-oxygen ratio we derive an upper limit of [NI/OI] < -0.65, which
suggests a chemically young absorption line system. This is supported by a
supersolar alpha/Fe ratio of [SiII/FeII] ~ 0.5. The most striking feature in
the observed abundance pattern is an unusually high sulphur-to-oxygen ratio of
0.69 < [SII/OI] < 1.26. We calculate detailed photoionisation models for two
subcomponents with Cloudy, and can rule out that ionisation effects alone are
responsible for the high S/O ratio. We instead speculate that the high S/O
ratio is caused by the combination of several effects, such as specific
ionisation conditions in multi-phase gas, unusual relative abundances of heavy
elements, and/or dust depletion in a local gas environment that is not well
mixed and/or that might be related to star-formation activity in the host
galaxy. We discuss the implications of our findings for the interpretation of
alpha-element abundances in metal absorbers at high redshift.

  Causal dynamical triangulations regularises the path integral through a
simplicial discretisation that introduces a preferred time foliation.
  The first part of this thesis presents three articles on causal dynamical
triangulations. The first article shows how to obtain a multicritical 2d model
by coupling the theory to hard dimers. The second explores the connection to
Ho\v{r}ava-Lifshitz gravity that is suggested by the time foliation and
establishes that in 2d the theories are equivalent. The last article does not
directly concern causal dynamical triangulations but Euclidian dynamical
triangulations with an additional measure term, which are examined to
understand whether they contain an extended phase without the need for a
preferred time foliation.
  Causal set theory uses an explicitly Lorentz invariant discretisation, which
introduces non-local effects.
  The second part of this thesis presents two articles in causal set theory.
The first explicitly calculates closed form expressions for the d'Alembertian
operator in any dimension, which can be implemented in computer simulations.
The second develops a ruler to examine the manifoldlikeness of small regions in
a causal set, and can be used to recover locality.

gravitational wave search that arises from using the GRB observation to
restrict the time and sky location of the source. We argue that this gives a
25% increase in sensitivity when compared to an all-sky, all-time search,
corresponding to more than doubling the number of detectable gravitational wave
signals associated with GRBs. Using this, we present the expected rate of joint
observations with the advanced LIGO and Virgo instruments, taking into account
the expected evolution of the gravitational wave detector network. We show that
in the early advanced gravitational wave detector observing runs, from
2015-2017, there is only a small chance of a joint observation. However, as the
detectors approach their design sensitivities, there is a good chance of joint
observations provided wide field GRB satellites, such as Fermi and the
Interplanetary Network, continue operation. The rate will also depend
critically upon the nature of the progenitor, with neutron star--black hole
systems observable to greater distances than double neutron star systems. The
relative rate of binary mergers and GRBs will depend upon the jet opening angle
of GRBs. Consequently, joint observations, as well as accurate measurement of
both the GRB rate and binary merger rates, will allow for an improved
estimation of the opening angle of GRBs.

hydrodynamic simulations of spirals, mergers, and high-redshift galaxies with
very high resolutions (3pc and 10^3 Msun) and detailed models for the
phase-space structure of the interstellar gas including shock heating, stellar
feedback processes and galactic winds. The simulations are analyzed with a
Large Velocity Gradient (LVG) model to compute the local emission in various
molecular lines in each resolution element, radiation transfer and opacity
effects, and the intensity emerging from galaxies, to generate synthetic
spectra for various transitions of the CO molecule. This model reproduces the
known properties of CO spectra and CO-to-H2 conversion factors in nearby
spirals and starbursting major mergers. The high excitation of CO lines in
mergers is dominated by an excess of high-density gas, and the high turbulent
velocities and compression that create this dense gas excess result in broad
linewidths and low CO intensity-to-H2 mass ratios. When applied to
high-redshift gas-rich disks galaxies, the same model predicts that their
CO-to-H2 conversion factor is almost as high as in nearby spirals, and much
higher than in starbursting mergers. High-redshift disk galaxies contain giant
star-forming clumps that host a high-excitation component associated to gas
warmed by the spatially-concentrated stellar feedback sources, although CO(1-0)
to CO(3-2) emission is overall dominated by low-excitation gas around the
densest clumps. These results overall highlight a strong dependence of CO
excitation and the CO-to-H2 conversion factor on galaxy type, even at similar
star formation rates or densities. The underlying processes are driven by the
interstellar medium structure and turbulence and its response to stellar
feedback, which depend on global galaxy structure and in turn impact the CO
emission properties.

them, with the aim of constraining the average state of H2 gas. Exploiting
prior knowledge of the velocity range, spatial extent and size of the CO
emission we measure reliable line fluxes with S/N>4-7 for individual
transitions. While the average CO Spectral Line Energy Distribution (SLED) has
a sub-thermal excitation similar to the Milky Way (MW) up to CO[3-2], we show
that the average CO[5-4] emission is four times stronger than assuming MW
excitation. This demonstrates the presence of an additional component of more
excited, denser and possibly warmer molecular gas. The ratio of CO[5-4] to
lower-J CO emission is lower than in local (U)LIRGs and high-redshift SMGs,
correlating closely with the average intensity of the radiation field <U> and
with the star formation surface density, but not with the SF efficiency (SFE).
The CO[5-4] luminosity correlates linearly with LIR over 4 orders of
magnitudes, with z=1.5 BzK galaxies following the same trend as local spirals
and (U)LIRGs and high redshift star bursting SMGs. The CO[5-4] luminosity is
thus empirically related to the dense gas, and might be a more convenient way
to probe it than standard high--density tracers that are much fainter than CO.
We see excitation variations among our sample galaxies, that can be linked to
their evolutionary state and clumpiness in optical rest frame images. In one
galaxy we see spatially resolved excitation variations, where the more highly
excited part of the galaxy corresponds to the location of massive SF clumps.
This supports to models that suggest that giant clumps are the main source of
the high excitation CO emission in high redshift disk-like galaxies.

relativistic jets from low-luminosity active galactic nuclei (LLAGN). We start
by proposing a model for the UHECR contribution from the black holes (BHs) in
LLAGN, which present a jet power $P_{\mathrm{j}} \leqslant 10^{46}$ erg
s$^{-1}$. This is in contrast to the opinion that only high-luminosity AGN can
accelerate particles to energies $ \geqslant 50$ EeV. We rewrite the equations
which describe the synchrotron self-absorbed emission of a non-thermal particle
distribution to obtain the observed radio flux density from sources with a
flat-spectrum core and its relationship to the jet power. We find that the
UHECR flux is dependent on the {\it observed radio flux density, the distance
to the AGN, and the BH mass}, where the particle acceleration regions can be
sustained by the magnetic energy extraction from the BH at the center of the
AGN. We use a complete sample of 29 radio sources with a total flux density at
5 GHz greater than 0.5 Jy to make predictions for the maximum particle energy,
luminosity, and flux of the UHECRs from nearby AGN. These predictions are then
used in a semi-analytical code developed in Mathematica (SAM code) as inputs
for the Monte-Carlo simulations to obtain the distribution of the arrival
direction at the Earth and the energy spectrum of the UHECRs, taking into
account their deflection in the intergalactic magnetic fields. For comparison,
we also use the CRPropa code with the same initial conditions as for the SAM
code. Importantly, to calculate the energy spectrum we also include the
weighting of the UHECR flux per each UHECR source. Next, we compare the energy
spectrum of the UHECRs with that obtained by the Pierre Auger Observatory.

convex objective functions over distributed networks. The only access to these
functions is through stochastic gradient oracles, each of which is only
available at a different node, and a limited number of gradient oracle calls is
allowed at each node. In this framework, we introduce a convex optimization
algorithm based on the stochastic gradient descent (SGD) updates. Particularly,
we use a carefully designed time-dependent weighted averaging of the SGD
iterates, which yields a convergence rate of
$O\left(\frac{N\sqrt{N}}{T}\right)$ after $T$ gradient updates for each node on
a network of $N$ nodes. We then show that after $T$ gradient oracle calls, the
average SGD iterate achieves a mean square deviation (MSD) of
$O\left(\frac{\sqrt{N}}{T}\right)$. This rate of convergence is optimal as it
matches the performance lower bound up to constant terms. Similar to the SGD
algorithm, the computational complexity of the proposed algorithm also scales
linearly with the dimensionality of the data. Furthermore, the communication
load of the proposed method is the same as the communication load of the SGD
algorithm. Thus, the proposed algorithm is highly efficient in terms of
complexity and communication load. We illustrate the merits of the algorithm
with respect to the state-of-art methods over benchmark real life data sets and
widely studied network topologies.

area in Natural Language Processing. Currently, Statistical Machine Translation
(SMT) dominates the Machine Translation research. Statistical Machine
Translation is an approach to Machine Translation which uses models to learn
translation patterns directly from data, and generalize them to translate a new
unseen text. The SMT approach is largely language independent, i.e. the models
can be applied to any language pair. Statistical Machine Translation (SMT)
attempts to generate translations using statistical methods based on bilingual
text corpora. Where such corpora are available, excellent results can be
attained translating similar texts, but such corpora are still not available
for many language pairs. Statistical Machine Translation systems, in general,
have difficulty in handling the morphology on the source or the target side
especially for morphologically rich languages. Errors in morphology or syntax
in the target language can have severe consequences on meaning of the sentence.
They change the grammatical function of words or the understanding of the
sentence through the incorrect tense information in verb. Baseline SMT also
known as Phrase Based Statistical Machine Translation (PBSMT) system does not
use any linguistic information and it only operates on surface word form.
Recent researches shown that adding linguistic information helps to improve the
accuracy of the translation with less amount of bilingual corpora. Adding
linguistic information can be done using the Factored Statistical Machine
Translation system through pre-processing steps. This paper investigates about
how English side pre-processing is used to improve the accuracy of
English-Tamil SMT system.

We
present a concrete cosmological model for which inflation has natural beginning

\Lambda^4 (1-\cos(\phi/f))$, which begins at $\phi \lesssim \pi f$ and ends at
$\phi =\phi_{\text{end}} \lesssim 5 f/3$. The distance traversed by the
inflaton field $\phi$ is sub-Planckian. The Gauss-Bonnet term ${\cal R}^2$
arising as leading curvature corrections in the action $S = \int d^5{x}
\sqrt{-g_{5}} M^3 (- 6\lambda M^2 + R + \alpha M^{-2} {\cal R}^2)+ \int d^{4}x
\sqrt{-g_{4}} (\dot{\phi}^2/2 - V(\phi)- \sigma +{\cal L}_{\text{matter}})$
(where $\alpha$ and $\lambda$ are constants and $M$ is the five-dimensional
Planck mass) plays a key role to terminate inflation. The model generates
appropriate tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ and inflationary perturbations that are
consistent with results from Planck and BICEP2. For example, for $N_*= 50-60$
and $n_s\sim 0.960\pm 0.005$, the model predicts that $M\sim 5.64\times
10^{16}\,{\text{GeV}}$ and $r\sim (0.14-0.21)$ [$N_*$ is the number of {\it
e}--folds of inflation and $n_s$ ($n_{t}$) is the scalar (tensor) spectrum
spectral index]. The ratio $-n_t/r$ is (13% -- 24%) less than its value in 4D
Einstein gravity, $-n_t/r=1/8$. The upper bound on the energy scale of
inflation $V^{1/4}=2.37\times 10^{16}\,{\text{GeV}}$ ($r<0.27$) implies that
$(-\lambda \alpha) \gtrsim 75 \times 10^{-5}$ and $\Lambda<2.17\times
10^{16}\,{\text{GeV}}$, which thereby rule out the case $\alpha=0$
(Randall-Sundrum model). The true nature of gravity is holographic as implied
by braneworld realization of string and M theory. The model correctly predicts
a late epoch cosmic acceleration with the dark energy equation of state ${\text
w}_{\text{DE}}\approx -1$.

atmospheric CO$_2$ concentrations. However, a complete physical picture able to
predict the structure developing within the porous medium is lacking. We
investigate theoretically reactive transport in the long-time evolution of
carbon in the brine-rock environment. As CO$_2$ is injected into a brine-rock
environment, a carbonate-rich region is created amid brine. Within the
carbonate-rich region minerals dissolve and migrate from regions of high
concentration to low concentration, along with other dissolved carbonate
species. This causes mineral precipitation at the interface between the two
regions. We argue that precipitation in a small layer reduces diffusivity, and
eventually causes mechanical trapping of the CO$_2$. Consequently, only a small
fraction of the CO$_2$ is converted to solid mineral; the remainder either
dissolves in water or is trapped in its original form. We also study the case
of a pure CO$_2$ bubble surrounded by brine and suggest a mechanism that may
lead to a carbonate-encrusted bubble due to structural diffusion.
