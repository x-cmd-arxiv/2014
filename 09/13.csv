the heart of designing materials that act as building blocks for self-assembly

controlling external parameters is also an important way of designing
biomimetic membranes. In this paper, we demonstrate that electrostatics can be
used as a tool to manipulate the shape of soft, closed membranes by tuning
environmental conditions such as the electrolyte concentration in the medium.
Using a molecular dynamics-based simulated annealing procedure, we investigate
charged elastic shells that do not exchange material with their environment,
such as elastic membranes formed in emulsions or synthetic nanocontainers. We
find that by decreasing the salt concentration or increasing the total charge
on the shell's surface, the spherical symmetry is broken, leading to the
formation of ellipsoids, discs, and bowls. Shape changes are accompanied by a
significant lowering of the electrostatic energy and a rise in the surface area
of the shell. To substantiate our simulation findings, we show analytically
that a uniformly charged disc has a lower Coulomb energy than a sphere of the
same volume. Further, we test the robustness of our results by including the
effects of charge renormalization in the analysis of the shape transitions and
find the latter to be feasible for a wide range of shell volume fractions.

between metallic and insulating phases, but classical phase transitions are
limited in speed by slow nucleation, proliferation of domains and hysteresis.
We can in principle avoid these problems by using quantum states for switching,

everyday devices. Macroscopic quantum states, such as the superconducting
ground state have the advantage that on a fundamental level they do not suffer
from decoherence plaguing microscopic systems. Here we demonstrate for the
first time ultrafast non-thermal switching between different metastable
electronically ordered states by pulsed electrical charge injection. The
macroscopic nature of the many-body quantum states(1-4) - which are not part of

deriving an asymptotic result, and with numerical illustrations, we demonstrate
that when a $g$-prior is adopted, this correspondence extends to the posterior
distribution of the model parameters. Thus, it is valid to translate inferences

for the study of S-type and P-type habitable regions in stellar binary systems,
which was, however, restricted to circular orbits of the stellar components.
Fortunately, a modest modification of the method also allows for the
consideration of elliptical orbits, which of course entails a much broader
range of applicability. This augmented method is presented here, and numerous
applications are conveyed. In alignment with Paper I, the selected approach
considers a variety of aspects, which comprise the consideration of a joint
constraint including orbital stability and a habitable region for a possible
system planet through the stellar radiative energy fluxes (""radiative habitable
zone""; RHZ). The devised method is based on a combined formalism for the
assessment of both S-type and P-type habitability; in particular, mathematical
criteria are deduced for which kinds of systems S-type and P-type habitable
zones are realized. If the RHZs are truncated by the additional constraint of
orbital stability, the notation of ST-type and PT-type habitability applies. In
comparison to the circular case, it is found that in systems of higher
eccentricity, the range of the RHZs is significantly reduced. Moreover, for a
considerable number of models, the orbital stability constraint also reduces
the range of S-type and P-type habitability. Nonetheless, S-, P-, ST-, and
PT-type habitability is identified for a considerable set of system parameters.
The method as presented is utilized for BinHab, an online code available at The
University of Texas at Arlington.

problem in a multiple-networks perspective and than deepen the analysis by
using ad hoc econometrics techniques. With respect to IM, a general positive
correlation with IT is highlighted and product categories for which this effect
is stronger are identified and cross-checked with previous classifications.
Next, employing spatial econometric techniques and proposing a new way to
define country neighbors based on the most intense IM flows, direct/indirect
network effects are studied and a stronger competitive effect of third country
migrants is identified for a specific product class. In the case of FDI, first
correlations between the two networks are identified, highlighting how they can
be mostly explained by countries economic/demographic size and geographical
distance. Then, using the Heckman selection model with a gravity equation,
(non-linear) components arising from distance, position in the Global Supply
Chain and presence of Regional Trade Agreements are studied. Finally, it is
shown how IT and FDI correlation changes with sectors: they are complements in

the deployment and serving of models at scale. In this work, we present Velox,

using existing offline large-scale compute frameworks into full-blown,
end-to-end data products capable of recommending products, targeting

distributions of finding the ground states of such instances, previous work
found agreement with both simulated quantum annealing (SQA) and a classical
rotor model. Thus the DW1 ground state success probabilities are consistent
with both models, and a different measure is needed to distinguish the data and
the models. Here we consider measures that account for ground state degeneracy
and the distributions of excited states, and present evidence that for these
new measures neither SQA nor the classical rotor model correlate perfectly with
the DW1 experiments. We thus provide evidence that SQA and the classical rotor
model, both of which are classically efficient algorithms, do not
satisfactorily explain all the DW1 data. A complete model for the DW1 remains
an open problem. Using the same criteria we find that, on the other hand, SQA
and the classical rotor model correlate closely with each other. To explain
this we show that the rotor model can be derived as the semiclassical limit of
the spin-coherent states path integral. We also find differences in which set
of ground states is found by each method, though this feature is sensitive to
calibration errors of the DW1 device and to simulation parameters.

model did not solve the problem of runaway modes, and the corresponding quantum
theory had ghost states. It is shown here that Englert's Hamiltonian is PT
symmetric, and that the problems with his model arise because the PT symmetry
is broken at both the classical and quantum level. However, by allowing the

the model into an unbroken PT-symmetric region, one eliminates the classical

transmission coefficient displays a sharp transition separating total
transmission from wave-blocking. Both the width and the central frequency of
the transition are in good agreement with their theoretical values. The shape
of the obstacle is identical to that used by the Vancouver team in the recent
experiment aiming at detecting the analogue of stimulated Hawking radiation.
Our results are compatible with the observations that have been reported. They
complete them by establishing that the contribution of the transmission
coefficient cannot be neglected for the lower half of the probed frequency
range.

due to inclusion of the effects of ion-neutral collisions in magnetized weakly

Alfven waves can explain non-thermally broadened and non-Gaussian profiles of
optically thin UV lines forming in the stellar chromosphere of alpha Tau and
other late-type giant and supergiant stars. The calculated heating rates in the
stellar chromosphere due to resistive (Joule) dissipation of electric currents,
induced by upward propagating non-linear Alfven waves, are consistent with
observational constraints on the net radiative losses in UV lines and the
continuum from alpha Tau. At the top of the chromosphere, Alfven waves
experience significant reflection, producing downward propagating transverse
waves that interact with upward propagating waves and produce velocity shear in
the chromosphere. Our simulations also suggest that momentum deposition by
non-linear Alfven waves becomes significant in the outer chromosphere at 1
stellar radius from the photosphere. The calculated terminal velocity and the
mass loss rate are consistent with the observationally derived wind properties

condition on the number of antennas at the secondary transmitter under which
the secondary system can communicate while causing no interference to the
primary receivers. We show that, to maximize the benefit, the secondary
transmitter should have at least the same number of antennas as the spatial
DoFs of the primary system. We then derive the secondary precoding and decoding
matrices to have zero interference leakage into the primary network while the
signal-to-interference plus noise ratio (SINR) at the secondary receiver is
maximized. As the success of the secondary communication depends on the
availability of unused DoFs, we then propose a fast sensing method based on the
eigenvalue analysis of the received signal covariance matrix to determine the
availability of unused DoFs or equivalently spatial holes. Since the proposed
fast sensing method cannot identify the indices of inactive primary streams, we
also provide a fine sensing method based on the generalized likelihood ratio
test (GLRT) to decide the absence of individual primary streams. Simulation
results show that the proposed CR sensing and transmission scheme can, in
practice, provide a significant throughput while causing no interference to the
primary receivers, and that the sensing detects the spatial holes of the
primary network with high detection probability.

enough to fragment, prograde discs are significantly shorter-lived than similar
discs orbiting retrograde with respect to the binary. For fragmenting discs of
all masses, we also find that prograde discs fragment across a narrower radial
region. If the cooling is slow enough that the disc enters a self-regulating
gravitoturbulent regime, we find that alignment between the disc and binary

estimate realistic cooling times for such discs, and find that in the majority

however, fundamentally different: while the former exist in the absence of
inter-particle interactions, the latter are broken symmetry states that owe
their very existence to such interactions. In particular, unlike the static

short-range two-body interaction between the Majorana fermions, with coupling
constant inversely proportional to the strength of the nuclear dipole-dipole

observables and mass down to the low mass regime to set tight constraints on
the fundamental cosmological parameters. Since an individual mass measurement
is only possible for a relatively small number of objects it is crucial to have
robust and well understood scaling relations that relate the total mass to
easily observable quantities. The main goal of this work is to constrain the
galaxy group scaling relations corrected for selection effects, and to quantify
the influence of non-gravitational physics at the low-mass regime. We analyzed
XMM-Newton observations for a complete sample of galaxy groups selected from
the ROSAT All-Sky Survey and we compared the derived scaling properties with a
galaxy cluster sample. To investigate the role played by the different
non-gravitational processes we then compared the observational data with the
predictions of hydrodynamical simulations. After applying the correction for
selection effects (e.g. Malmquist bias) the L-M relation is steeper than the
observed one. Its slope is also steeper than the value obtained by using the
more massive systems of the HIFLUGCS sample. This behaviour can be explained by
a gradual change of the true L-M relation which should be taken into account
when converting the observational parameters into masses. The other observed
scaling relations (not corrected for selection biases) do not show any break
although the comparison with the simulations suggests that feedback processes
play an important role in the formation and evolution of galaxy groups. Thanks
to our master sample of 82 objects spanning two order of magnitude in mass we
tightly constrain the dependence of the gas mass fraction on the total mass,
finding almost a factor of two difference between groups and clusters.

individual quantum mechanical objects with unprecedented accuracy, opening the
door for both quantum and extreme-scale conventional computing applications. As
these devices become larger and more complex, the ability to design them such

leads naturally to a metric for benchmarking device performance and optimizing

of these dense, low-mass substructures is relatively long $(5-11 \rm{Gyrs})$,

density slopes of galactic haloes acted-on by feedback is to be expected given
the stochastic mass accretion histories of low-mass haloes and the diverse star

the best-fit bias parameters do not agree well with the peak-background split

transmitter be initially present at the target focusing point, which limits the
application of this technique. In this paper, we propose a method to focus
waves at an arbitary location inside a complex enclosure using a numerically
calculated wave excitation signal. We use a semi-classical ray algorithm to
calculate the signal that would be received at a transceiver port resulting
from the injection of a short pulse at the desired target location. The
time-reversed version of this signal is then injected into the transceiver port
and an approximate reconstruction of the short pulse is created at the target.
The quaility of the pulse reconstruction is quantified in three different ways
and the values of these metrics are predicted by the statistics of the
scattering-parameter $|S_{21}|^2$ between the transceiver and target points in
the enclosure. We experimentally demonstrate the method using a flat microwave
billiard and quantify the reconstruction quality as a function of enclosure
loss, port coupling and other considerations.

Hence, they are obvious dark energy candidates. To make such models compatible

""chameleon"" mechanism, which renders an effective mass depending on the local
matter density. If chameleon particles exist, they can be produced in the sun
and detected on Earth exploiting the equivalent of a radiation pressure. Since
their effective mass scales with the local matter density, chameleons can be
reflected by a dense medium if their effective mass becomes greater than their
total energy. Thus, under appropriate conditions, a flux of solar chameleons
may be sensed by detecting the total instantaneous momentum transferred to a
suitable opto-mechanical force/pressure sensor. We calculate the solar
chameleon spectrum and the reach in the chameleon parameter space of an

implies that chondrules and matrix grains had quite different collisional
sticking parameters. Further, we note that the absence of large melted objects
in Semarkona means that chondrules must have exited the melting zone rapidly,
before the chondrule agglomerations could form. The simplest explanation for
this rapid exit is that chondrule melting occurred in surface layers of the

short time scales.

choice in many application domains primarily due to its simplicity, time/space
efficiency, and invariance to the ordering of the data points. Unfortunately,
the algorithm's sensitivity to the initial selection of the cluster centers
remains to be its most serious drawback. Numerous initialization methods have
been proposed to address this drawback. Many of these methods, however, have
time complexity superlinear in the number of data points, which makes them
impractical for large data sets. On the other hand, linear methods are often
random and/or sensitive to the ordering of the data points. These methods are
generally unreliable in that the quality of their results is unpredictable.
Therefore, it is common practice to perform multiple runs of such methods and
take the output of the run that produces the best results. Such a practice,
however, greatly increases the computational requirements of the otherwise
highly efficient k-means algorithm. In this chapter, we investigate the
empirical performance of six linear, deterministic (non-random), and
order-invariant k-means initialization methods on a large and diverse
collection of data sets from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The results
demonstrate that two relatively unknown hierarchical initialization methods due

The thermal re-emission by dust of absorbed energy is considered driven merely
by young stars and, consequently, often applied to trace the star formation
rate in galaxies. Recent studies have argued that the old stellar population
might anticipate a non-negligible fraction of the radiative dust heating.
  Aims: In this work, we aim to analyze the contribution of young (< 100 Myr)
and old (~ 10 Gyr) stellar populations to radiative dust heating processes in
the nearby grand-design spiral galaxy M51 using radiative transfer modeling.
High-resolution 3D radiative transfer (RT) models are required to describe the
complex morphologies of asymmetric spiral arms and clumpy star-forming regions
and model the propagation of light through a dusty medium.
  Methods: In this paper, we present a new technique developed to model the
radiative transfer effects in nearby face-on galaxies. We construct a
high-resolution 3D radiative transfer model with the Monte-Carlo code SKIRT
accounting for the absorption, scattering and non-local thermal equilibrium
(NLTE) emission of dust in M51. The 3D distribution of stars is derived from
the 2D morphology observed in the IRAC 3.6 {\mu}m, GALEX FUV, H{\alpha} and
MIPS 24 {\mu}m wavebands, assuming an exponential vertical distribution with an
appropriate scale height. The dust geometry is constrained through the
far-ultraviolet (FUV) attenuation, which is derived from the observed
total-infrared-to-far-ultraviolet luminosity ratio. The stellar luminosity,
star formation rate and dust mass have been scaled to reproduce the observed
stellar spectral energy distribution (SED), FUV attenuation and infrared SED.

carry current via special ""topologically protected"" edge states. The
understanding of long range topological order in these systems is built around
the idea of a Berry connection, which is a gauge connection obtained from the
phase of the electron wave function transported over momentum space rather than
coordinate space. The phase of a closed Wilson loop of the Berry connection
around the Brillouin zone defines a topological order parameter which labels
discrete flux vacua. The conducting states are surface modes on the domain
walls between discrete vacua. Evidence from large-$N_c$ chiral dynamics,
holographic QCD, and Monte Carlo observations has pointed to a picture of the
QCD vacuum that is very similar to that of a topological insulator, with
discrete quasivacua labelled by $\theta$ angles that differ by mod $2\pi$. In
this picture, the domain walls are membranes of Chern-Simons charge, and the
quark condensate consists of surface modes on these membranes, which are
delocalized and thus support the long range propagation of Goldstone pions. The
Berry phase in QED2 describes charge polarization of fermion-antifermion pairs,
while in 4D QCD it describes the polarization of Chern-Simons membranes.

corona in the extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) with Hinode, TRACE, SDO and recent Hi-C

solar coronal heating, the major goal of solar physics. The data from EUV/SXR
missions suggest that solar corona is a non-uniform environment structured into
active regions (AR) represented by bundles magnetic loops heated to
temperatures exceeding 5 MK. Any viable coronal heating model should be capable
of reproducing EUV and SXR emission from coronal active regions well as dynamic
activity. Measurements of emission measures (EM) for ARs provide clues to time
dependence of the heating mechanism: static versus impulsive. While static
equilibrium coronal loop models are successful in reproducing SXR emission
within an AR, they cannot adequately predict the bright EUV loops. Meantime,
impulsive heating is capable in reproducing both EUV and SXR loop emission. The
major goal of this paper is to construct realistic synthetic EM images of
specific solar corona active region, AR 11117 by using our 1D fully non-linear
time-dependent single-fluid hydrodynamic code. We first construct a magnetic
skeleton for the entire active region using the HMI/SDO magnetogram for AR

specify impulsive heating of individual strands (flux tubes) comprising coronal
loops. Next, we simulated the response of the entire active region (with LOS
projection effects) to the heating function (volumetric heating rate) scaled
with magnetic field and spatial scale parameters and find the best match
between synthetic and actual (reconstructed) DEMs obtained by SDO.

quantitative rules is Zipf's law which states that the frequency of occurrence

`law' of ranks has been found to hold across disparate texts and forms of data,
analyses of increasingly large corpora over the last 15 years have revealed the
existence of two scaling regimes. These regimes have thus far been explained by
a hypothesis suggesting a separability of languages into core and non-core
lexica. Here, we present and defend an alternative hypothesis, that the two
scaling regimes result from the act of aggregating texts. We observe that text
mixing leads to an effective decay of word introduction, which we show provides
accurate predictions of the location and severity of breaks in scaling. Upon
examining large corpora from 10 languages in the Project Gutenberg eBooks

investigate the capability of future radio telescopes to probe the spacetime of
a black hole and test gravity theories, by timing a pulsar orbiting a
stellar-mass-black-hole (SBH). Based on mock data simulations, we show that a
few years of timing observations of a sufficiently compact pulsar-SBH (PSR-SBH)
system with future radio telescopes would allow precise measurements of the
black hole mass and spin. A measurement precision of one per cent can be
expected for the spin. Measuring the quadrupole moment of the black hole,
needed to test GR's no-hair theorem, requires extreme system configurations
with compact orbits and a large SBH mass. Additionally, we show that a PSR-SBH
system can lead to greatly improved constraints on alternative gravity theories
even if they predict black holes (practically) identical to GR's. This is
demonstrated for a specific class of scalar-tensor theories. Finally, we
investigate the requirements for searching for PSR-SBH systems. It is shown
that the high sensitivity of the next generation of radio telescopes is key for

waves heat disks via compressional heating (i.e. $P\rm{d}V$ work), and can
trigger accretion outbursts by activating the magnetorotational instability
(MRI) in the magnetically inert disk dead-zone. The GI-induced spiral waves
propagate well inside of gravitationally unstable region before they trigger
outbursts at $R \lesssim 1$ AU where GI cannot be sustained. This long-range
propagation of waves cannot be reproduced with the previously used local
$\alpha$ treatments for GI. In our standard model where zero dead-zone residual
viscosity ($\alpha_{\rm rd}$) is assumed, the GI-induced stress measured at the
onset of outbursts is locally as large as $0.01$ in terms of the generic
$\alpha$ parameter. However, as suggested in our previous one-dimensional
calculations, we confirm that the presence of a small but finite $\alpha_{\rm
rd}$ triggers thermally-driven bursts of accretion instead of the GI +
MRI-driven outbursts that are observed when $\alpha_{\rm rd}=0$. The inclusion
of non-zero residual viscosity in the dead-zone decreases the importance of GI
soon after mass feeding from the envelope cloud ceases. During the infall phase
while the central protostar is still embedded, our models stay in a quiescent
accretion phase with $\dot{M}_{acc}\sim10^{-8}-10^{-7}~M_{\odot}~{\rm yr^{-1}}$

characterizations and properties of weakly modular graphs and of cell complexes

`nonpositive curvature' and `local-to-global' properties and characterizations

introduced as a far-reaching common generalization of median graphs (and more
generally, of modular and orientable modular graphs), Helly graphs, bridged
graphs, and dual polar graphs occurring under different disguises in several
seemingly-unrelated fields of mathematics: Metric graph theory, Geometric group
theory, Incidence geometries and buildings, Theoretical computer science and
combinatorial optimization. We give a local-to-global characterization of
weakly modular graphs and their subclasses in terms of simple connectedness of
associated triangle-square complexes and specific local combinatorial
conditions. In particular, we revisit characterizations of dual polar graphs by
Cameron and by Brouwer-Cohen. We also show that (disk-)Helly graphs are
precisely the clique-Helly graphs with simply connected clique complexes. With
$l_1$-embeddable weakly modular and sweakly modular graphs we associate
high-dimensional cell complexes, having several strong topological and
geometrical properties (contractibility and the CAT(0) property). Their cells
have a specific structure: they are basis polyhedra of even
$\triangle$-matroids in the first case and orthoscheme complexes of gated dual
polar subgraphs in the second case. We resolve some open problems concerning
subclasses of weakly modular graphs: we prove a Brady-McCammond conjecture
about CAT(0) metric on the orthoscheme complexes of modular lattices; we answer
Chastand's question about prime graphs for pre-median graphs.

channels. Such a channel maps $n$ input bits to $n$ output symbols in
$\{0,1,\wedge\}$, where $\wedge$ denotes erasure. The channel is causal if, for
every $i$, the channel adversarially decides whether to erase the $i$th bit of
its input based on inputs $1,...,i$, before it observes bits $i+1$ to $n$. Such
a channel is $p$-bounded if it can erase at most a $p$ fraction of the input
bits over the whole transmission duration. Causal channels provide a natural
model for channels that obey basic physical restrictions but are otherwise
unpredictable or highly variable. For a given erasure rate $p$, our goal is to
understand the optimal rate (the capacity) at which a randomized (stochastic)
encoder/decoder can transmit reliably across all causal $p$-bounded erasure
channels. In this paper, we introduce the causal erasure model and provide new
upper bounds and lower bounds on the achievable rate. Our bounds separate the
achievable rate in the causal erasures setting from the rates achievable in two
related models: random erasure channels (strictly weaker) and fully adversarial
erasure channels (strictly stronger). Specifically, we show:
  - A strict separation between random and causal erasures for all constant
erasure rates $p\in(0,1)$.
  - A strict separation between causal and fully adversarial erasures for
$p\in(0,\phi)$ where $\phi \approx 0.348$.
  - For $p\in[\phi,1/2)$, we show codes for causal erasures that have higher
rate than the best known constructions for fully adversarial channels.
  Our results contrast with existing results on correcting causal bit-flip
errors (as opposed to erasures) [Dey et. al 2008, 2009], [Haviv-Langberg 2011].
For the separations we provide, the analogous separations for bit-flip models
are either not known at all or much weaker.

compressive traveling interplanetary solar-wind bulk-velocity jumps due to
their specific interactions with the jump-inherent electric fields. After
thermalization of this energy gain per shock passage through the operation of
the Buneman instability, strong electron heating occurs that substantially
influences the radial electron temperature profile. We describe the reduction
of the jump amplitude due to energy expended by the traveling jump structure.
We consider three effects; namely energy loss due to heating of electrons,
energy loss due to work done against the pick-up-ion pressure gradient, and an
energy gain due to nonlinear jump steepening. Taking these effects into
account, we show that the decrease in jump amplitude with solar distance is
more pronounced when the initial jump amplitude is higher in the inner solar
system. Independent of the initial jump amplitude, it eventually decreases with
increasing distance to a value of the order of $\Delta U/U\simeq 0.1$ at the
position of the heliospheric termination shock, where $\Delta U$ is the jump
amplitude, and $U$ is the average solar-wind bulk velocity.The electron
temperature, on the other hand, is strongly correlated with the initial jump
amplitude, leading to electron temperatures between 6000 K and 20 000 K at
distances beyond 50 AU. We compare our results with in-situ measurements of the

characterized by nonzero topological invariants defined in a two-dimensional

a constant-depth quantum circuit of geometrically local gates, or evolution for

Locality-preserving logical gates of topological codes are intrinsically fault
tolerant because spatially localized errors remain localized, and hence
sufficiently dilute errors remain correctable. By invoking general properties
of two-dimensional topological field theories, we find that the
locality-preserving logical gates are severely limited for codes which admit
non-abelian anyons; in particular, there are no locality-preserving logical
gates on the torus or the sphere with M punctures if the braiding of anyons is
computationally universal. Furthermore, for Ising anyons on the M-punctured
sphere, locality-preserving gates must be elements of the logical Pauli group.
We derive these results by relating logical gates of a topological code to
automorphisms of the Verlinde algebra of the corresponding anyon model, and by
requiring the logical gates to be compatible with basis changes in the logical
Hilbert space arising from local F-moves and the mapping class group.

imaging and genomic data analysis is how to reduce their dimensions. Most
previous methods for imaging information extraction and RNA-seq data reduction
do not explore imaging spatial information and often ignore gene expression
variation at genomic positional level. To overcome these limitations, we extend
functional principle component analysis from one dimension to two dimension

mathematical framework in which to investigate the problems of well-posedness,
asymptotic analysis and parameter estimation for fully nonlinear evolutionary
game models. A theory is developed as a dynamical system on the state space of
finite signed Borel measures under the weak star topology. Two drawbacks of the
previous theory is that the techniques and machinery involved in establishing
the results are awkward and have not shed light on the parameter estimation
question. For example, in \cite{CLEVACK} the proof for the existence of the
dynamical system is obtained via a fixed point argument using the total
variation topology, however, the continuity of the model is established in the
$weak^* $ topology. This has caused some confusion. I have remedied this by
making all the vital rates Lipschitz and the dynamical system is defined on the
dual of the bounded Lipschitz maps, a Banach space. I introduce a method of
multiplying a functional by a family of functionals. This multiplication
behaves nicely with respect to taking normed estimates. It allows us to form a
semiflow that is locally Lipschitz, positive invariant, and covers all cases:
discrete, continuous, pure selection, selection mutation and measure valued
models. Under biologically motivated assumptions the model is uniformly
eventually bounded. This remedies both the above problems as only one norm is
used, this norm induces the $weak^*$ topology on the positive cone of measures
and since we have a norm and local Lipschitzity we can form a theory of
Parameter Estimation.

ideas as discrete, countable entities, as opposed to different external

Uprooted from Darwinian theory, BVSR lacks a scientific framework that can be
called upon to generate hypotheses and test them. In lieu of such a framework,
hypotheses appear to be generated on the basis of previous data--they are not
theory-driven. The paper does not explain how the hypothesis that creativity is
enhanced by engagement in a ""network of enterprises"" is derived from BVSR; this
hypothesis is more compatible with competing conceptions of creativity. The
notion that creativity involves backtracking conflates evidence for
backtracking with respect to the external output with evidence for backtracking
of the conception of the invention. The first does not imply the second; a
creator can set aside a creative output but cannot go back to the conception of
the task he/she had prior to generating that output. The notion that creativity
entails superfluity (i.e., many ideas have ""zero usefulness"") is misguided;
usefulness is context-dependent, moreover, the usefulness of an idea may reside
in its being a critical stepping-stone to a subsequent idea.

dimension $n$, where $n\in \mathbb{N}$, $\wedge^{r}V$ be the exterior algebra
of $V$, the problem is to find $\max_{\| \xi \| = 1, \| \eta \| = 1}\| \xi
\wedge \eta \|$ where $k,l$ $\in \mathbb{N},$ $\forall \xi \in \wedge^{k}V,
\eta \in \wedge^{l}V.$
  This is a problem suggested by the famous Nobel Prize Winner C.N. Yang. He
solved this problem for $k\leq 2$ in [1], and made the following
\textbf{conjecture} in [2] : If $n=2m$, $k=2r$, $l=2s$, then the maximum is
achieved when $\xi_{max} = \frac{\omega^{k}}{\| \omega^{k}\|}, \eta_{max} =
\frac{\omega^{l}}{\| \omega^{l}\|}$, where $ \omega = \Sigma_{i=1}^m
e_{2i-1}\wedge e_{2i}, $ and $\{e_{k}\}_{k=1}^{2m}$ is an orthonormal basis of
V.
  From a physicist's point of view, this problem is just the dual version of
the easier part of the well-known Beauzamy-Bombieri inequality for product of
polynomials in many variables, which is discussed in [4].
  Here the duality is referred as the well known Bose-Fermi correspondence,
where we consider the skew-symmetric algebra(alternative forms) instead of the
familiar symmetric algebra(polynomials in many variables)
  In this paper, for two cases we give estimations of the maximum of exterior
products, and the Yang's conjecture is answered partially under some special
cases.

crossing protected by mirror symmetry. The topological nodes can be unbuckled
through breaking the mirror symmetry and a photonic Chern insulator can be

strengthen the finite size effect, providing ways to engineer helical edge

which contains the quantum vacuum of Standard Model in its symmetric phase, and
condensed matter systems with zeroes in the energy spectrum, which form Fermi
surfaces, Weyl and Dirac points, Dirac lines, Khodel-Shaginyan flat bands, etc.
Some zeroes are topologically protected, being characterized by topological
invariants, expressed in terms of Green's function. For stability of the others
the ${\bf p}$-space topology must be accompanied by symmetry.
  Vacua with Weyl points serve as a source of effective relativistic quantum
fields emerging at low energy: chiral fermions, effective gauge fields and
tetrad gravity emerge together in the vicinity of a Weyl point. The
accompanying effects, such as chiral anomaly, electroweak baryo-production and
chiral vortical effect, are expressed via the symmetry protected ${\bf
p}$-space invariants.
  The gapless topological media exhibit the bulk-surface and bulk-vortex
correspondence: which in particular may lead to the flat band on the surface of
the system or in the core of topological defects. The materials with flat band
in bulk, on the surface or within the dislocations have singular density of
states, which crucially influences the critical temperature of the
superconducting transition in such media. While in all the known
superconductors the transition temperature is exponentially suppressed as a
function of the pairing interaction, in the flat band the transition
temperature is proportional to the pairing interaction, and can be essentially
higher. The ${\bf p}$-space topology may give us the general recipe for search
or artificial fabrication of the room-temperature superconductors.

  2012 conference",,,,"cs.SE cs.PL","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The main goal of concept-oriented programming (COP) is describing how objects
are represented and accessed. It makes references (object locations)
first-class elements of the program responsible for many important functions
which are difficult to model via objects. COP rethinks and generalizes such
primary notions of object-orientation as class and inheritance by introducing a
novel construct, concept, and a new relation, inclusion. An advantage is that
using only a few basic notions we are able to describe many general patterns of
thoughts currently belonging to different programming paradigms: modeling
object hierarchies (prototype-based program-ming), precedence of parent methods
over child methods (inner methods in Beta), modularizing cross-cutting
con-cerns (aspect-oriented programming), value-orientation (functional
programming). Since COP remains backward compatible with object-oriented
programming, it can be viewed as a perspective direction for developing a
simple and natural unified programming model.

waveforms, while each receive node performs matched filtering with the known
set of transmit waveforms, and forwards the results to the fusion center. Based
on the data it receives from multiple antennas, the fusion center formulates a
matrix, which, in conjunction with standard array processing schemes, such as
MUSIC, leads to target detection and parameter estimation. In MIMO radars with
compressive sensing (MIMO-CS), the data matrix is formulated by each receive
node forwarding a small number of compressively obtained samples. In this
paper, it is shown that under certain conditions, in both sampling cases, the
data matrix at the fusion center is low-rank, and thus can be recovered based
on knowledge of a small subset of its entries via matrix completion (MC)
techniques. Leveraging the low-rank property of that matrix, we propose a new
MIMO radar approach, termed, MIMO-MC radar, in which each receive node either
performs matched filtering with a small number of randomly selected dictionary
waveforms or obtains sub-Nyquist samples of the received signal at random
sampling instants, and forwards the results to a fusion center. Based on the
received samples, and with knowledge of the sampling scheme, the fusion center
partially fills the data matrix and subsequently applies MC techniques to
estimate the full matrix. MIMO-MC radars share the advantages of the recently
proposed MIMO-CS radars, i.e., high resolution with reduced amounts of data,
but unlike MIMO-CS radars do not require grid discretization. The MIMO-MC radar
concept is illustrated through a linear uniform array configuration, and its
target estimation performance is demonstrated via simulations.

described by statistical models with a phenomenological level density parameter
that depends on excitation energies, deformations and mass regions. In the
microscopic view of hot nuclei, the neutron emission rates can be determined by
the external neutron gas densities without any free parameters. Therefore the
microscopic description of thermal neutron emissions is desirable that can
impact several understandings such as survival probabilities of superheavy
compound nuclei and neutron emissivity in reactors.
  To describe the neutron emission rates microscopically, the external thermal
neutron gases are self-consistently obtained based on the Finite-Temperature
Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov (FT-HFB) approach. The results are compared with the
statistical model to explore the connections between the FT-HFB approach and
the statistical model.
  The Skyrme FT-HFB equation is solved by HFB-AX in deformed coordinate spaces.
Based on the FT-HFB approach, the thermal properties and external neutron gas
are properly described with the self-consistent gas substraction procedure.
Then neutron emission rates can be obtained based on the densities of external
neutron gases.
  The thermal statistical properties of $^{238}$U and $^{258}$U are studied in
detail in terms of excitation energies. The thermal neutron emission rates in
$^{238, 258}$U and superheavy compound nuclei $_{112}^{278}$Cn and
$_{114}^{292}$Fl are calculated, which agree well with the statistical model by
adopting an excitation-energy-dependent level density parameter.
  The coordinate-space FT-HFB approach can provide reliable microscopic
descriptions of neutron emission rates in hot nuclei, as well as microscopic
constraints on the excitation energy dependence of level density parameters for
statistical models.

system is confined inside a frictionless channel, and one in which it is placed
in an anisotropic frictional environment, modeling the dynamical setting of the
slithering of snakes on flat surfaces. The presence of constraints in both
cases leads to non-standard boundary conditions, that allow us to close the
equations of motion reducing them to a differential and an integro-differential
equation, respectively, for one end point (the tail) of the active rod. For the
snake-like case we also provide analytic solutions for a special class of
motions. We highlight the role of the spontaneous curvature in the pushing (and
the steering, in the snake-like setting) needed to power locomotion.
Comparisons with available experiments confirm that the model is able to
capture many of the essential findings in the zoological literature. The
complete solvability and the existence of analytic solutions offers a tool that

contamination and to achieve better spectral efficiency, it is important to use
a small number of pilots. We present a novel channel estimation approach which
utilizes the sparsity and common support properties to estimate sparse channels
and require a small number of pilots. Two algorithms based on this approach
have been developed which perform Bayesian estimates of sparse channels even
when the prior is non-Gaussian or unknown. Neighboring antennas share among
each other their beliefs about the locations of active channel taps to perform
estimation. The coordinated approach improves channel estimates and also
reduces the required number of pilots. Further improvement is achieved by the

GeV into an on-shell W^-W^+-pair in a uniform magnetic field becomes, in
principle, possible and the new decay channel of this boson in a magnetic field
is allowed by the energy and total angular momentum conservation laws. The
required magnetic field strength for observation of the measurable effect is
~10^23 G (or in Teslas ~10^19 T). The existence of the other neutral boson with
the spin J=0 and with the other mass is not either excluded in the mass range
below 2m_W=160.77 GeV.

  Conference on Large Hadron Collider Physics (Columbia University, New York,

  arXiv:1410.1564",,,,"physics.gen-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We investigate the decay of an arbitrary neutral boson into a pair of
on-shell W-bosons in a magnetic field. The possible existence of the new
neutral bosons with the spins 0, 2, 3 and with the charge conjugation C=+1 in
the energy (mass) range from zero to 160.77 GeV is predicted. The analyses show
that the existence of the neutral boson with the spin 2 in the energy (mass)
range from zero to 160.77 GeV is more promising and realistic.
