leverages deep convolutional networks trained for whole-image recognition to
localize objects in images without additional human supervision, i.e., without
using any ground-truth bounding boxes for training. The key idea is to analyze
the change in the recognition scores when artificially masking out different
regions of the image. The masking out of a region that includes the object
typically causes a significant drop in recognition score. This idea is embedded
into an agglomerative clustering technique that generates self-taught
localization hypotheses. Our object localization scheme outperforms existing
proposal methods in both precision and recall for small number of subwindow
proposals (e.g., on ILSVRC-2012 it produces a relative gain of 23.4% over the
state-of-the-art for top-1 hypothesis). Furthermore, our experiments show that
the annotations automatically-generated by our method can be used to train
object detectors yielding recognition results remarkably close to those
obtained by training on manually-annotated bounding boxes.

gravitational recoil due to anisotropic emission of gravitational waves. A
recoiling supermassive black hole (SBH) can subsequently undergo long-lived
oscillations in the potential well of its host galaxy, suggesting that offset
SBHs may be common in the cores of massive ellipticals. We have analyzed HST
archival images of 14 nearby core ellipticals, finding evidence for small
($\lesssim 10$ pc) displacements between the AGN (locating the SBH) and the
center of the galaxy (the mean photocenter) in 10 of them. Excluding objects
that may be affected by large-scale isophotal asymmetries, we consider six
galaxies to have detected displacements, including M87, where a displacement
was previously reported by Batcheldor et al. 2010. In individual objects, these
displacements can be attributed to residual gravitational recoil oscillations
following a major or minor merger within the last few Gyr. For plausible merger
rates, however, there is a high probability of larger displacements than those
observed, if SBH coalescence took place in these galaxies. Remarkably, the
AGN-photocenter displacements are approximately aligned with the radio source
axis in four of the six galaxies with displacements, including three of the
four having relatively powerful kpc-scale jets. This suggests intrinsic
asymmetries in radio jet power as a possible displacement mechanism, although
approximate alignments are also expected for gravitational recoil. Orbital
motion in SBH binaries and interactions with massive perturbers can produce the
observed displacement amplitudes but do not offer a ready explanation for the
alignments.

popular, especially in the media industry, all around the world for a long
time. Although the 0.4 standard is widely accepted, the derivation of the value
lacks rigid theoretical foundations. In fact, to the best of our knowledge, it
is not based on any prevalent and convincing economic theories. In this paper,
we incorporate Rawls' principle of fair equality of opportunity into
Arrow-Debreu's framework of general equilibrium theory with heterogeneous
agents, and derive the alarming level of Gini coefficient formally. Our theory
reveals that the exponential distribution of income not only satisfies Pareto
optimality, but also obeys social fairness in Rawls' sense. Therefore, we
specify the maximal value of the Gini coefficient when income follows
exponential distribution as a possible alarming level. Our computations show
that the alarming level should be specified at least equal or larger than 0.5
rather than 0.4. We empirically investigate if our model receives support from
a large data set of all kinds of countries all over the world from Word Bank in
1990, 1995, 2000 and 2005 using the distribution fitting and statistical
decision methodology. The results suggest that the value of 0.4 is around the
mean of the Gini coefficients, corresponding to the most probable event in a
peaceful world, rather than the alarming level, while the two-sigma rule shows
that in our sample the alarming levels are all larger than 0.5, conforming to

super-strong liquid of low fragility that dynamically controls MOF collapse. A
subsequent order-disorder transition creates a high density liquid of greater
fragility. After crystallization and melting, subsequent cooling results in a
stable glass virtually identical to the high density phase. Furthermore, the
wide-ranging melting temperatures of different MOFs suggest these can be

that rapid size-change can substantially reduce separation in bluff bodies
traveling several body lengths, and recover fluid energy which can be employed
to improve the propulsive performance. The robot is found to experience speeds
over ten body lengths per second, exceeding that of a similarly propelled

more than 2.6 times that on an optimal rigid body performing the same maneuver,
experimentally demonstrating large energy recovery and enabling acceleration
greater than 14 body lengths per second squared. Finally, over 53% of the

estimate a limiting peak optical depth of 1.37 and a column density of $\rm
6\times 10^{19}~cm^{-2}$. The physical extent of the absorber is $\rm
0.04~kpc^2$ and covers $\sim$25-30\% of the background source. A comparison
between the emission and absorption strengths suggests the cold-to-total HI
column density in the absorber is ~30%. Folding in the covering fraction, the
cold-to-total HI mass is ~10%. This suggest that condensation of warm HI ($\rm
T_s\sim 1000~K$) to cold phase ($\rm T_s < 100~K$) is suppressed in UGC 7408.
The unusually low temperature of the HI absorber also indicates inefficiency in
condensation of atomic gas into molecular gas. The suppression in condensation
is likely to be the result of low-metal content in this galaxy. The same
process might explain the low efficiency of star formation in dwarf galaxies

heating transition at which the cosmic gas is heated to the temperature of the

of vanishing {\tau}) by examining the variances of these increments conditioned
on the local topology of the flow. Interestingly, these longitudinal and
transverse Lagrangian increments are found to share some qualitative features
with their Eulerian counterparts. In particular, direct numerical simulations
at turbulent Reynolds number up to 300 show that the distributions of the
longitudinal increment are negatively skewed at all {\tau}, which is a
signature of time irreversibility of turbulence in the Lagrangian framework.
Transverse increments are found more intermittent than longitudinal increments,
as quantified by the comparison of their respective flatnesses and scaling
laws. Although different in nature, standard Lagrangian increments (projected
on fixed axis) exhibit scaling properties that are very close to transverse
Lagrangian increments.

more than one deformation equivalence classes with different signs of $Z(M,

classifying symplectic manifolds into three categories.
  We finally prove that on every closed symplectic manifold $(M, \omega)$ of
dimension $\geq 4$, any smooth function which is somewhere negative and
somewhere zero can be the scalar curvature of an almost-K\""ahler metric
compatible with a symplectic form which is deformation equivalent to $\omega$.

estimation problems with strongly correlated variables. We prove sufficient
conditions for clustering based on the correlation/colinearity of variables
using the OWL norm, of which the so-called OSCAR is a particular case. Our
results extend previous ones for OSCAR in several ways: for the squared error
loss, our conditions hold for the more general OWL norm and under weaker
assumptions; we also establish clustering conditions for the absolute error
loss, which is, as far as we know, a novel result. Furthermore, we characterize
the statistical performance of OWL norm regularization for generative models in
which certain clusters of regression variables are strongly (even perfectly)
correlated, but variables in different clusters are uncorrelated. We show that
if the true p-dimensional signal generating the data involves only s of the
clusters, then O(s log p) samples suffice to accurately estimate the signal,
regardless of the number of coefficients within the clusters. The estimation of
s-sparse signals with completely independent variables requires just as many
measurements. In other words, using the OWL we pay no price (in terms of the
number of measurements) for the presence of strongly correlated variables.

flexible and pervasive sensing ability. Although many incentive mechanisms have
been built to attract extensive user participation, Most of these mechanisms
focus only on independent task scenarios, where the sensing tasks are
independent of each other. On the contrary, we focus on a periodical task
scenario, where each user participates in the same type of sensing tasks
periodically. In this paper, we consider the long-term user participation
incentive in a general periodical MCS system from a frugality payment
perspective. We explore the issue under both semi-online (the intra-period
interactive process is synchronous while the inter-period interactive process
is sequential and asynchronous during each period) and online user arrival
models (the previous two interactive processes are sequential and
asynchronous). In particular, we first propose a semi-online frugal incentive
mechanism by introducing a Lyapunov method. Moreover, we also extend it to an
online frugal incentive mechanism, which satisfies the constant frugality.
Besides, the two mechanisms can also satisfy computational efficiency,
asymptotical optimality, individual rationality and truthfulness. Through
extensive simulations, we evaluate the performance and validate the theoretical
properties of our online mechanisms.

as expected, the superconductor undergoes a second order thermal transition to
the normal state, and is only weakly magnetized near $T_c$. At intermediate
fields the thermal transition is still second order, but the magnetization is
significantly larger, characteristic of a `breached pair' state. At strong

address the strong CP problem. We show that a DFSZ-like invisible axion model
with a gauge-singlet complex scalar field S, whose couplings to the Standard
Model are naturally ultra-weak, can solve the strong CP problem and
simultaneously generate acceptable electroweak symmetry breaking. The
ultra-weak couplings of the singlet S are associated with underlying
approximate shift symmetries that act as custodial symmetries and maintain
technical naturalness. The model also contains a very light pseudo-Goldstone
dilaton that is consistent with cosmological Polonyi bounds, and the axion can
be the dark matter of the universe. We further outline how a SUSY version of
this model, which may be required in the context of Grand Unification, can
avoid introducing a hierarchy problem.

  with Facilities",,,,,"cs.CY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  With the rise of cheap small-cells in wireless cellular networks, there are
new opportunities for third party providers to service local regions via
sharing arrangements with traditional operators. In fact, such arrangements are
highly desirable for large facilities---such as stadiums, universities, and
mines---as they already need to cover property costs, and often have fibre
backhaul and efficient power infrastructure. In this paper, we propose a new
network sharing arrangement between large facilities and traditional operators.
Our facility network sharing arrangement consists of two aspects: leasing of
core network access and spectrum from traditional operators; and service
agreements with users. Importantly, our incorporation of a user service
agreement into the arrangement means that resource allocation must account for
financial as well as physical resource constraints. This introduces a new
non-trivial dimension into wireless network resource allocation, which requires
a new evaluation framework---the data rate is no longer the only main
performance metric. Moreover, despite clear economic incentives to adopt
network sharing for facilities, a business case is lacking. As such, we develop
a general socio-technical evaluation framework based on ruin-theory, where the
key metric for the sharing arrangement is the probability that the facility has
less than zero revenue surplus. We then use our framework to evaluate our
facility network sharing arrangement, which offers guidance for leasing and
service agreement negotiations, as well as design of the wireless network
architecture, taking into account network revenue streams.

detailed characterisation of the atmosphere is possible, whereas its
non-negligible orbital eccentricity calls for further investigation.
Independent analyses of several individual datasets obtained with Spitzer have
led to contradicting results attributed to the different techniques used to
treat the instrumental effects. Aims. We aim at investigating these previous
controversial results and developing our knowledge of the system based on the
full Spitzer photometry dataset combined with new Doppler measurements obtained
with the HARPS spectrograph. We also want to search for additional planets.
Methods. We optimise aperture photometry techniques and the photometric
deconvolution algorithm DECPHOT to improve the data reduction of the Spitzer
photometry spanning wavelengths from 3-24 {\mu}m. Adding the high precision
HARPS radial velocity data, we undertake a Bayesian global analysis of the
system considering both instrumental and stellar effects on the flux variation.
Results. We present a refined radius estimate of RP=4.10 +/- 0.16 R_Earth, mass
MP=25.4 +/- 2.1 M_Earth and eccentricity e= 0.162 +/- 0.004 for GJ 436b. Our
measured transit depths remain constant in time and wavelength, in disagreement
with the results of previous studies. In addition, we find that the
post-occultation flare-like structure at 3.6 {\mu}m that led to divergent
results on the occultation depth measurement is spurious. We obtain occultation
depths at 3.6, 5.8, and 8.0 {\mu}m that are shallower than in previous works,
in particular at 3.6 {\mu}m. However, these depths still appear consistent with
a metal-rich atmosphere depleted in methane and enhanced in CO/CO2, although
perhaps less than previously thought. We find no evidence for a potential
planetary companion, stellar activity, nor for a stellar spin-orbit
misalignment. [ABRIDGED]

color image enhancement system. The algorithm has been designed into
architecture suitable for FPGA/ASIC implementation. The color image enhancement
is achieved by first convolving an original image with a Gaussian kernel since
Gaussian distribution is a point spread function which smoothen the image.
Further, logarithm-domain processing and gain/offset corrections are employed
in order to enhance and translate pixels into the display range of 0 to 255.
The proposed algorithm not only provides better dynamic range compression and
color rendition effect but also achieves color constancy in an image. The
design exploits high degrees of pipelining and parallel processing to achieve
real time performance. The design has been realized by RTL compliant Verilog
coding and fits into a single FPGA with a gate count utilization of 321,804.
The proposed method is implemented using Xilinx Virtex-II Pro XC2VP40-7FF1148

of sizes of up to 1600x1200 pixels at the real time video rate of 116 frames

powerful learning algorithm which will be benchmark on various dataset.
  The framework we proposed is based on booleen circuits; more specifically the
classifier produced by our algorithm have that form. Using bits and boolean
gates instead of real numbers and multiplication enable the the learning
algorithm and classifier to use very efficient boolean vector operations. This
enable both the learning algorithm and classifier to be extremely efficient.
The accuracy of the classifier we obtain with our framework compares very
favorably those produced by conventional techniques, both in terms of
efficiency and accuracy.

applications is the ability to control spin currents in solid state systems.
Among the different platforms proposed so far, semiconductors with strong
spin-orbit interaction are especially attractive as they promise fast and
scalable spin control with all-electrical protocols. Here we demonstrate both
the generation and measurement of pure spin currents in semiconductor
nanostructures. Generation is purely electrical and mediated by the spin
dynamics in materials with a strong spin-orbit field. Measurement is
accomplished using a spin-to-charge conversion technique, based on the magnetic
field symmetry of easily measurable electrical quantities. Calibrating the
spin-to-charge conversion via the conductance of a quantum point contact, we
quantitatively measure the mesoscopic spin Hall effect in a multiterminal GaAs
dot. We report spin currents of 174 pA, corresponding to a spin Hall angle of
34%.

Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is presented in this paper. The image
enhancement using MSR scheme heavily depends on parameters such as Gaussian
surround space constant, number of scales, gain and offset etc. Selection of
these parameters, empirically and its application to MSR scheme to produce
inevitable results are the major blemishes. The method presented here results
in huge savings of computation time as well as improvement in the visual
quality of an image, since the PSO exploited maximizes the MSR parameters. The
objective of PSO is to validate the visual quality of the enhanced image
iteratively using an effective objective criterion based on entropy and edge
information of an image. The PSO method of parameter optimization of MSR scheme
achieves a very good quality of reconstructed images, far better than that
possible with the other existing methods. Finally, the quality of the enhanced
color images obtained by the proposed method are evaluated using novel metric,
namely, Wavelet Energy (WE). The experimental results presented show that color
images enhanced using the proposed scheme are clearer, more vivid and
efficient.

unitarity for particles interacting via strictly finite-range interactions. We
generalize Wigner's causality bound to the case of non-vanishing partial-wave

between protons and neutrons. We also analyze low-energy scattering for systems
with arbitrary short-range interactions plus an attractive $1/r^{\alpha}$ tail
for $\alpha\geq2$. In particular, we focus on the case of $\alpha=6$ and we
derive the constraints of causality and unitarity also for these systems and
find that the van der Waals length scale dominates over parameters
characterizing the short-distance physics of the interaction. This separation
of scales suggests a separate universality class for physics characterizing
interactions with an attractive $1/r^{6}$ tail. We argue that a similar
universality class exists for any attractive potential $1/r^{\alpha}$ for
$\alpha\geq2$.
  In the second part of the thesis we present lattice Monte Carlo calculations
of fermion-dimer scattering in the limit of zero-range interactions using the
adiabatic projection method. The adiabatic projection method uses a set of

improvable description of the low-lying scattering cluster states in a finite
volume. We use L\""uscher's finite-volume relations to determine the $s$-wave,
$p$-wave, and $d$-wave phase shifts. For comparison, we also compute exact
lattice results using Lanczos iteration and continuum results using the
Skorniakov-Ter-Martirosian equation. For our Monte Carlo calculations we use a
new lattice algorithm called impurity lattice Monte Carlo. This algorithm can

process $V_t$ and its maximal jump processes, are derived, and used to make
""small time"" (as $t\downarrow0$) asymptotic comparisons between them. The
representations are constructed using properties of the underlying Poisson
point process of the jumps of $X$. Apart from providing insight into the
connections between $X$, $V$, and their maximal jump processes, they enable
investigation of a great variety of limiting behaviours. As an application, we
study ""self-normalised"" versions of $X_t$, that is, $X_t$ after division by
$\sup_{0<s\le t}\Delta X_s$, or by $\sup_{0<s\le t}| \Delta X_s|$. Thus, we
obtain necessary and sufficient conditions for $X_t/\sup_{0<s\le t}\Delta X_s$
and $X_t/\sup_{0<s\le t}| \Delta X_s|$ to converge in probability to 1, or to
$\infty$, as $t\downarrow0$, so that $X$ is either comparable to, or dominates,
its largest jump. The former situation tends to occur when the singularity at 0
of the L\'evy measure of $X$ is fairly mild (its tail is slowly varying at 0),
while the latter situation is related to the relative stability or attraction
to normality of $X$ at 0 (a steeper singularity at 0). An important component

with each other. Analogous ""large time"" (as $t\to \infty$) versions of the

such models are quite predictive in the amount and pattern of $CP$ violation

constraints some of the models can already be excluded. For this purpose we
provide an overview of the experimental constraints on the different left-right
symmetric models, considering bounds from colliders, meson-mixing and
low-energy observables, such as beta decay and electric dipole moments. The
features of the various Yukawa and Higgs sectors are discussed in detail. In

turns out that all left-right models with $P$, $C$, and/or $CP$ symmetry have a
high degree of fine-tuning, unless supplemented with mechanisms to suppress
certain parameters. The models that are symmetric under both $P$ and $C$ are
not in accordance with present observations, whereas the models with either
$P$, $C$, or $CP$ symmetry can not be excluded by data yet. To further
constrain and discriminate between the models measurements of $B$-meson
observables at LHCb and $B$-factories will be especially important, while
measurements of the EDMs of light nuclei in particular could provide

capacity over the non-authenticated public channel will be the same as that of
the case with a passive Eve, while the key capacity over the non-authenticated

exciton-polariton condensates. These are governed by a nonlinear
quantum-mechanical system involving exciton and photon wavefunctions. We
calculate all non-traveling harmonic soliton solutions for the one-dimensional
lossless system. There are two frequency bands of bright solitons when the
inter-exciton interactions produce an attractive nonlinearity and two frequency
bands of dark solitons when the nonlinearity is repulsive. In addition, there
are two frequency bands for which the exciton wavefunction is discontinuous at
its symmetry point, where it undergoes a phase jump of pi. A band of continuous
dark solitons merges with a band of discontinuous dark solitons, forming a
larger band over which the soliton far-field amplitude varies from zero to
infinity; the discontinuity is initiated when the operating frequency exceeds
the free exciton frequency. The far fields of the solitons in the lowest and
highest frequency bands (one discontinuous and one continuous dark) are
linearly unstable, whereas the other four bands have linearly stable far
fields, including the merged band of dark solitons.

investigating the physics of supernovae explosions. There are still a large
number of outstanding questions, such the reason for the asymmetric radio
morphology, the structure of the pre-supernova environment, and the efficiency
of particle acceleration at the supernova shock. We explore these questions
using three-dimensional simulations of the expanding remnant between days 820
and 10,000 after the supernova. We combine a hydrodynamical simulation with
semi-analytic treatments of diffusive shock acceleration and magnetic field
amplification to derive radio emission as part of an inverse problem.
Simulations show that an asymmetric explosion, combined with magnetic field
amplification at the expanding shock, is able to replicate the persistent
one-sided radio morphology of the remnant. We use an asymmetric Truelove &
McKee progenitor with an envelope mass of $10 M_{\sun}$ and an energy of $1.5
\times 10^{44} J$. A termination shock in the progenitor's stellar wind at a
distance of $0\farcs43-0\farcs51$ provides a good fit to the turn on of radio
emission around day 1200. For the H\textsc{ii} region, a minimum distance of
$0\farcs63\pm0\farcs01$ and maximum particle number density of $(7.11\pm1.78)
\times 10^7$ m$^{-3}$ produces a good fit to the evolving average radius and
velocity of the expanding shocks from day 2000 to day 7000 after explosion. The
model predicts a noticeable reduction, and possibly a temporary reversal, in
the asymmetric radio morphology of the remnant after day 7000, when the forward
shock left the eastern lobe of the equatorial ring.

chemostat-like equations under the assumption that the dynamics of the resource
is considerably slower than that of the consumer. The presence of two different
time scales enables to carry out a fairly complete analysis of the problem.
This is done by treating consumers and resources in the coupled system as
fast-scale and slow-scale variables respectively and subsequently considering
developments in phase planes of these variables, fast and slow, as if they are
independent. When uncoupled, each pair has unique asymptotically stable steady
state and no self-sustained oscillatory behavior (although damped oscillations
about the equilibrium are admitted). When the consumer-resource pairs are
weakly coupled through direct reciprocal inhibition of consumers, the whole
system exhibits self-sustained relaxation oscillations with a period that can
be significantly longer than intrinsic relaxation time of either pair. It is
shown that the model equations adequately describe locally linked
consumer-resource systems of quite different nature: living populations under
interspecific interference competition and lasers coupled via their cavity
losses.

has been submitted to the CERN SPSC. LBNO considers three types of neutrino
detector technologies: a double-phase liquid argon (LAr) TPC and a magnetised
iron detector as far detectors. For the near detector, a high-pressure gas TPC
embedded in a calorimeter and a magnet is the baseline design. A mandatory
milestone is a concrete prototyping effort towards the envisioned large-scale
detectors, and an accompanying campaign of measurements aimed at assessing the
detector associated systematic errors. The proposed $6\times 6\times 6$m$^3$
DLAr is an industrial prototype of the design discussed in the EoI and scalable
to 20 kton or 50~kton. It is to be constructed and operated in a controlled
laboratory and surface environment with test beam access, such as the CERN
North Area (NA). Its successful operation and full characterisation will be a
fundamental milestone, likely opening the path to an underground deployment of
larger detectors. The response of the DLAr demonstrator will be measured and
understood with an unprecedented precision in a charged particle test beam
(0.5-20 GeV/c). The exposure will certify the assumptions and calibrate the
response of the detector, and allow to develop and to benchmark sophisticated
reconstruction algorithms, such as those of 3-dimensional tracking, particle ID
and energy flow in liquid argon. All these steps are fundamental for validating
the correctness of the physics performance described in the LBNO EoI.

the main theorem is proved without usual demiclosedness condition. Also, under
the appropriate assumptions on the control sequences and operators, our

we speak about a generall data compression, it has to be a lossless one. It
means, we are able to recover the original data 1:1 from the compressed file.
Multimedia data (images, video, sound...), are a special case. In this area, we
can use something called a lossy compression. Our main goal is not to recover
data 1:1, but only keep them visually similar. This article is about an image
compression, so we will be interested only in image compression. For a human
eye, it is not a huge difference, if we recover RGB color with values
[150,140,138] instead of original [151,140,137]. The magnitude of a difference
determines the loss rate of the compression. The bigger difference usually
means a smaller file, but also worse image quality and noticable differences
from the original image. We want to cover compression techniques mainly from
the last decade. Many of them are variations of existing ones, only some of
them uses new principes.
