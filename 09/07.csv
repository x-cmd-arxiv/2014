Modeling of anomalous load, however, has often been ignored in the research
literature. Occurring on special days, such as public holidays, anomalous load
conditions pose considerable modeling challenges due to their infrequent
occurrence and significant deviation from normal load. To overcome these
limitations, we adopt a rule-based approach, which allows incorporation of
prior expert knowledge of load profiles into the statistical model. We use
triple seasonal Holt-Winters-Taylor (HWT) exponential smoothing, triple
seasonal autoregressive moving average (ARMA), artificial neural networks
(ANNs), and triple seasonal intraweek singular value decomposition (SVD) based
exponential smoothing. These methods have been shown to be competitive for
modeling load for normal days. The methodological contribution of this paper is
to demonstrate how these methods can be adapted to model load for special days,
when used in conjunction with a rule-based approach. The proposed rule-based
method is able to model normal and anomalous load in a unified framework. Using
nine years of half-hourly load for Great Britain, we evaluate point forecasts,
for lead times from one half-hour up to a day ahead. A combination of two
rule-based methods generated the most accurate forecasts.

investigated models have asymptotic height distributions and spatial
covariances in agreement with those expected for the KPZ subclass for curved
surfaces. In $1+1$ dimensions, the height distribution and covariance are given
by the GUE Tracy-Widom distribution and the Airy$_2$ process, instead of the
GOE and Airy$_1$ foreseen for flat interfaces. These results imply that, when
the KPZ class splits into the curved and flat subclasses, as conventionally
considered, the expanding substrate may play a role equivalent to, or perhaps
more important than the global curvature. Moreover, the translational
invariance of the interfaces evolving on growing domains allowed us to
accurately determine, in $2+1$ dimensions, the analogue of the GUE Tracy-Widom
distribution for height distribution and that of the Airy$_2$ process for
spatial covariance. Temporal covariance is also calculated and shown to be
universal in each dimension and in each of the two subclasses. A logarithmic
correction associated to the duplication of column is observed and

instability or a soft-mode instability. We show that the ideal strength
measurement of graphene based on nano-indentation experiments
\cite{lee2008measurement, lee2013high}, however, indicates an anomaly: the
inferred strain beneath the diamond indenter at the failure load is anomalously
large compared to the fracture strain predicted by soft-mode analysis or
acoustic analysis. Here we present a systematic investigation - based on
multi-scale modeling combining the results of continuum, atomistic, and quantum
calculations; and analysis of experiments - that identifies the operative
mechanism responsible for the anomalous difference between the fracture
strains. We suggest that a strain-shielding effect due to
mechanically-activated covalent bond formation at graphene-indenter interface
is responsible for this anomaly. Using Finite Elements Analysis (FEA) and MD
simulations of the nanoindentation experiments, we explicitly show that the
bonded interaction at the graphene-indenter interface substantially disperses
(shields) the strain beneath the indenter, preventing the intensification of
strain. Our calculations indicate that the extent of strain shielding depends
upon the hydrogen coverage at the indenter surface; and at optimal hydrogen
coverage, the strain-shielding effect can delay the onset of fracture to the
experimentally-observed indentation load and depth.

the structure optimizer component which improves the website navigation

  We begin by formalizing the concept of recommendations used for discovery. We
formulate this as a natural graph optimization problem which in its simplest
case, reduces to a bipartite matching problem. In practice, solving these
matching problems requires superlinear time and is not scalable. Also,
implementing simple algorithms is critical in practice because they are
significantly easier to maintain in production. This motivated us to analyze
three methods for solving the problem in increasing order of sophistication: a
sampling algorithm, a greedy algorithm and a more involved partitioning based
algorithm.
  We first theoretically analyze the performance of these three methods on
random graph models characterizing when each method will yield a solution of
sufficient quality and the parameter ranges when more sophistication is needed.
We complement this by providing an empirical analysis of these algorithms on
simulated and real-world production data. Our results confirm that it is not
always necessary to implement complicated algorithms in the real-world and that
very good practical results can be obtained by using heuristics that are backed

also found to be independent of $\eta$ within the measured range of

and novel treatments of major depressive disorder (MDD). EEG performed
simultaneously with an rtfMRI-nf procedure allows an independent evaluation of
rtfMRI-nf brain modulation effects. Frontal EEG asymmetry in the alpha band is
a widely used measure of emotion and motivation that shows profound changes in
depression. However, it has never been directly related to simultaneously
acquired fMRI data. We report the first study investigating
electrophysiological correlates of the rtfMRI-nf procedure, by combining
rtfMRI-nf with simultaneous and passive EEG recordings. In this pilot study,
MDD patients in the experimental group (n=13) learned to upregulate BOLD
activity of the left amygdala using an rtfMRI-nf during a happy emotion
induction task. MDD patients in the control group (n=11) were provided with a
sham rtfMRI-nf. Correlations between frontal EEG asymmetry in the upper alpha
band and BOLD activity across the brain were examined. Average individual
changes in frontal EEG asymmetry during the rtfMRI-nf task for the experimental
group showed a significant positive correlation with the MDD patients'
depression severity ratings, consistent with an inverse correlation between the
depression severity and frontal EEG asymmetry at rest. Temporal correlations
between frontal EEG asymmetry and BOLD activity were significantly enhanced,
during the rtfMRI-nf task, for the amygdala and many regions associated with
emotion regulation. Our findings demonstrate an important link between amygdala
BOLD activity and frontal EEG asymmetry. Our EEG asymmetry results suggest that
the rtfMRI-nf training targeting the amygdala is beneficial to MDD patients,
and that alpha-asymmetry EEG-nf would be compatible with the amygdala
rtfMRI-nf. Combination of the two could enhance emotion regulation training and
benefit MDD patients.

imperfect estimate of the topology of the gene tree. In this note, we
demonstrate formally that a basic statistical problem arises if one tries to

objects. The field of cluster analysis is crowded with diverse methods that
make special assumptions about data and address different scientific aims.
Despite its shortcomings in accuracy, hierarchical clustering is the dominant
clustering method in bioinformatics. Biologists find the trees constructed by
hierarchical clustering visually appealing and in tune with their evolutionary
perspective. Hierarchical clustering operates on multiple scales
simultaneously. This is essential, for instance, in transcriptome data where
one may be interested in making qualitative inferences about how lower-order
relationships like gene modules lead to higher-order relationships like
pathways or biological processes. The recently developed method of convex
clustering preserves the visual appeal of hierarchical clustering while
ameliorating its propensity to make false inferences in the presence of
outliers and noise. The current paper exploits the proximal distance principle
to construct a novel algorithm for solving the convex clustering problem. The
solution paths generated by convex clustering reveal relationships between
clusters that are hidden by static methods such as k-means clustering. Our
convex clustering software separates parameters, accommodates missing data, and
supports prior information on relationships. The software is implemented on ATI
and nVidia graphics processing units (GPUs) for maximal speed. Several
biological examples illustrate the strengths of convex clustering and the
ability of the proximal distance algorithm to handle high-dimensional problems.

brain parcels used as nodes in the connectome analysis were functionnally
defined by a group cluster analysis. We first validated that a classic
Benjamini-Hochberg procedure with parametric GLM tests did control
appropriately the false-discovery rate (FDR) at a given scale. We then observed
on realistic simulations that there was no substantial inflation of the FDR
across scales, as long as the FDR was controlled independently within each
scale, and the presence of true associations could be established using an
omnibus permutation test combining all scales. Second, we observed both on
simulations and on three real resting-state fMRI datasets (schizophrenia,
congenital blindness, motor practice) that the rate of discovery varied
markedly as a function of scales, and was relatively higher for low scales,
below 25. Despite the differences in discovery rate, the statistical maps
derived at different scales were generally very consistent in the three real

illustrating the potential benefits of multiscale analysis. On real data, the
statistical maps agreed well with the existing literature. Overall, our results

in dynamics simulation of deformable models. They are history-based, as their
success is strictly based on an assumption of a collision-free state at the
start of each time interval. On the other hand, in many applications surfaces
have normals defined to designate their orientation (i.e. front- and
back-face), yet CCD methods are totally blind to such orientation
identification (thus are orientation-free). We notice that if such information
is utilized, many penetrations can be untangled. In this paper we present a
history-free method for separation of two penetrating meshes, where at least
one of them has clarified surface orientation. This method first computes all
edge-face (E-F) intersections with discrete collision detection (DCD), and then
builds a number of penetration stencils. On response, the stencil vertices are
relocated into a penetration-free state, via a global displacement minimizer.
Our method is very effective for handling penetration between two meshes, being
it an initial configuration or in the middle of physics simulation. The major
limitation is that it is not applicable to self-collision within one mesh at
the time being.

a discussion of the effect of the resulting extensive structure in temperature,

the usual clumping effect on density-squared diagnostics, the spatial porosity
of optically thick clumps can reduce single-density continuum absorption, and a

Vlasov plasmas outside the scope or purview of linear theory constructs such as
electron plasma waves or ion acoustic waves. Nonlinear stationary mode theories
such as those leading to BGK modes also do not apply. The range in velocity
that is strongly perturbed by KEEN waves depends on the amplitude and duration
of the ponderomotive force used to drive them. Smaller amplitude drives create
highly localized structures attempting to coalesce into KEEN waves. These cases
have much more chaotic and intricate time histories than strongly driven ones.
The narrow range in which one must maintain adequate velocity resolution in the
weakly driven cases challenges xed grid numerical schemes. What is missing
there is the capability of resolving locally in velocity while maintaining a
coarse grid outside the highly perturbed region of phase space. We here report
on a new Semi-Lagrangian Vlasov-Poisson solver based on conservative
non-uniform cubic splines in velocity that tackles this problem head on. An
additional feature of our approach is the use of a new high-order
time-splitting scheme which allows much longer simulations per computational e
ort. This is needed for low amplitude runs which take a long time to set up
KEEN waves, if they are able to do so at all. The new code's performance is

which are recognized to exhibit good practical performance, especially in
high-dimensional settings. On the theoretical side, however, their predictive
power remains largely unexplained, thereby creating a gap between theory and
practice. The aim of this paper is twofold. Firstly, we provide theoretical
guarantees to link finite forests used in practice (with a finite number M of
trees) to their asymptotic counterparts. Using empirical process theory, we
prove a uniform central limit theorem for a large class of random forest
estimates, which holds in particular for Breiman's original forests. Secondly,
we show that infinite forest consistency implies finite forest consistency and
thus, we state the consistency of several infinite forests. In particular, we
prove that q quantile forests---close in spirit to Breiman's forests but easier
to study---are able to combine inconsistent trees to obtain a final consistent
prediction, thus highlighting the benefits of random forests compared to single

12-45 keV signal rate of 0.29+/-0.01 cts/s. After removing the periodic dips
and an X-ray burst, the 0.8 - 45 keV continuum was successfully described by an
optically thick disk emission with an inner-disk temperature ~ 0.7 keV and a
neutron-star blackbody emission with a temperature ~ 1.3 keV, on condition that
the blackbody component, or possibly the disk emission too, is significantly
Comptonized. This successful modeling is consistent with 4U 1915-05 being in a
high-soft state in this observation, and implies that its broadband spectrum
can be interpreted in the same scheme as for many non-dipping Low-mass X-ray
binaries in the soft state. Its bolometric luminosity (~ 0.02 times the
Eddington limit) is relatively low for the soft state, but within a tolerance,
if considering the distance and inclination uncertainties. As a
high-inclination binary, this source exhibited stronger Comptonization effect,
with a larger Comptonizing y-parameter, compared to low and medium inclination
binaries. This suggests that the Comptonizing coronae of these objects in the
soft state is in an oblate (rather than spherical) shape, extending along the
accretion disk plane, because the y-parameter would not depend on the

regime is achieved via three-wave resonant interactions with the scattering of
two of these waves on the third/slow mode for which $k_{\parallel} = 0$. When
the interactions with the slow mode are artificially reduced the system
exhibits an energy spectrum with $k_{\perp}^{-3/2}$, whereas the expected exact
solution with $k_{\perp}^{-2}$ is recovered with the full nonlinear system. In
the latter case, strong intermittency is found when the vector separation of
structure functions is taken transverse to ${\bf b_0}$ - at odds with classical
weak turbulence where self-similarity is expected. This surprising result,
which is being reported here for the first time, may be explained by the
influence of slow modes whose regime belongs to strong turbulence. We derive a

accuracy of several dust-correction factors typically employed to estimate
total star-formation rate (SFR) of high-redshift star-forming (SF) galaxies. We
also analyze what stacking suggests about the relation between SFR and stellar
mass and the redshift evolution of the specific SFR (${\rm sSFR} = {\rm SFR} /
{\rm M_*}$). We find that the dust properties of massive SF galaxies evolve
with redshift, being galaxies at $z \sim 2-3$ more attenuated than at $z \sim
1$ for a given UV continuum slope and stellar mass. As a consequence, a single
IRX-$\beta$ relation can not be used to recover the total SFR of massive SF
galaxies at $0 \lesssim z \lesssim 3$. This might have implications for higher
redshift studies, where a single IRX-$\beta$ relation derived for local
starburst is usually assumed to be valid. However, we find that the local
relation between dust attenuation and stellar mass is valid at least up to $z
\sim 1$, although deviations are found for higher redshift galaxies where only
$\log{\left( M_* / M_\odot \right)} > 10.25-10.50$ galaxies are detected
through stacking. This, therefore, does not rule out the possibility that the
local dust-mass relation can be valid for less massive SF galaxies at $z \sim
2-3$. The SED fitting procedure with stellar population templates gives
over-estimated values (about 0.3--0.5 dex in $\log{\rm SFR}$) of the
dust-corrected SFR at all redshifts studied here. We find that the slope of the
main-sequence of star formation is less steep than previously found in massive
galaxies with $\log{\left( M_* / M_\odot \right)} \geq 10$, and the redshift
evolution of the sSFR reported in previous works in massive is well recovered.

role in the optoelectronic properties of nanoscale devices(1-6). Understanding
the surface trap states allows us to properly engineer the device surfaces for
better performance. But characterization of surface trap states at nanoscale
has been a formidable challenge using the traditional capacitive techniques
based on metal-insulator-semiconductor (MIS) structures(7) and deep level
transient spectroscopy (DLTS)(8-11). Here, we demonstrate a simple but powerful
optoelectronic method to probe the density of nanowire surface trap states to
the limit of a single trap state. Unlike traditional capacitive techniques
(Fig1a), in this method we choose to tune the quasi-Fermi level across the
bandgap of a silicon nanowire photoconductor, allowing for capture and emission
of photogenerated charge carriers by surface trap states (Fig1b). The
experimental data show that the energy density of nanowire surface trap states
is in a range from 10^9cm^-2/eV at deep levels to 10^12cm^-2/eV in the middle
of the upper half bandgap. This optoelectronic method allows us to conveniently
probe trap states of ultra-scaled nano/quantum devices at extremely high

asymptotic relationship that describes how the limiting spectral distribution
of (true) sample covariance matrices depends on that of
information-plus-noise-type sample covariance matrices. As an application, we
consider the inference about the spectra of integrated covolatility (ICV)
matrices of high-dimensional diffusion processes based on high-frequency data

an information-plus-noise-type covariance matrix, and the aforementioned
result, together with a (generalized) connection between the spectral
distribution of true sample covariance matrices and that of the population
covariance matrix, enables us to propose a two-step procedure to estimate the
spectral distribution of ICV for a class of diffusion processes. An alternative
estimator is further proposed, which possesses two desirable properties: it
eliminates the impact of microstructure noise, and its limiting spectral
distribution depends only on that of the ICV through the standard
Mar\v{c}enko-Pastur equation. Numerical studies demonstrate that our proposed
methods can be used to estimate the spectra of the underlying covariance matrix

the delayed detonation model and the production of $\sim$0.6 $\rm M_\odot$ of
$^{56}$Ni, consistent with the observed brightness, the brightness decline

measuring the amount of $^{56}$Ni and thus the mass of the ejecta. Late-time
line profiles of SN 2014J are rather symmetric and not shifted in the rest

transition layer between incomplete burning and nuclear statistical
equilibrium. We may see [Fe III] and [Ni IV] emission, both of which are

relatively obvious attributes and overlooked non-obvious attributes, i.e.,

Lucas}), plays an important role in Number Theory and Combinatorics. In this
article, consisting of six sections, we provide a historical survey of Lucas
type congruences, generalizations of Lucas' theorem modulo prime powers, Lucas
like theorems for some generalized binomial coefficients, and some their
applications.
  In Section 1 we present the fundamental congruences modulo a prime including
the famous Lucas' theorem. In Section 2 we mention several known proofs and
some consequences of Lucas' theorem. In Section 3 we present a number of
extensions and variations of Lucas' theorem modulo prime powers. In Section 4
we consider the notions of the Lucas property and the double Lucas property,
where we also present numerous integer sequences satisfying one of these
properties or a certain Lucas type congruence. In Section 5 we collect several
known Lucas type congruences for some generalized binomial coefficients. In
particular, this concerns the Fibonomial coefficients, the Lucas $u$-nomial
coefficients, the Gaussian $q$-nomial coefficients and their generalizations.
Finally, some applications of Lucas' theorem in Number Theory and Combinatorics
are given in Section 6.

material have been studied by temperature-dependent neutron powder diffraction,
low temperature magnetometry and heat capacity measurements. RbMnPO4 represents
a rare example of a weak ferromagnetic polar material, containing Mn2+ ions
with TN = 4.7 K. The neutron powder diffraction pattern recorded at T = 10 K
shows that the compound crystallizes in the chiral and polar monoclinic space
group P21 (No. 4) with the unit-cell parameters: a = 8.94635(9) {\AA}, b =
5.43415(5) {\AA}, c = 9.10250(8) {\AA} and beta = 90.4209(6){\deg}. A close
inspection of the crystal structure of RbMnPO4 shows that this material
presents two different types of zigzag chains running along the b axis. This is
a unique feature among the zeolite-ABW type materials exhibiting the P21
symmetry. At low temperature, RbMnPO4 exhibits a canted antiferromagnetic
structure characterized by the propagation vector k1 = 0 resulting in the
magnetic symmetry P21. The magnetic moments lie mostly along the b axis with
the ferromagnetic component being in the ac plane. Due to the geometrical
frustration present in this system, an intermediate phase appears within the
temperature range 4.7 - 5.1 K characterized by the propagation vector k2 = (kx,
0, kz) with kx/kz = 2. This ratio is reminiscent of the multiferroic phase of
the orthorhombic RMnO3 phases (R = rare earth). This suggests that RbMnPO4
could present some multiferroic properties at low temperature. Our density
functional calculations confirm the presence of magnetic frustration, which
explains this intermediate incommensurate phase. Taking into account the
strongest magnetic interactions, we are able to reproduce the magnetic
structure observed experimentally at low temperature.
