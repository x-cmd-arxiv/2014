patient's medical state, but an unfortunate consequence of most prescription
drugs is the occurrence of undesirable side effects. Side effects that occur in
more than one in a thousand patients are likely to be signalled efficiently by
current drug surveillance methods, however, these same methods may take decades
before generating signals for rarer side effects, risking medical morbidity or
mortality in patients prescribed the drug while the rare side effect is
undiscovered. In this paper we propose a novel computational meta-analysis
framework for signalling rare side effects that integrates existing methods,
knowledge from the web, metric learning and semi-supervised clustering. The
novel framework was able to signal many known rare and serious side effects for
the selection of drugs investigated, such as tendon rupture when prescribed
Ciprofloxacin or Levofloxacin, renal failure with Naproxen and depression
associated with Rimonabant. Furthermore, for the majority of the drug
investigated it generated signals for rare side effects at a more stringent
signalling threshold than existing methods and shows the potential to become a
fundamental part of post marketing surveillance to detect rare side effects.

  Designs","Drug Safety, 37 (3), pp. 163-170, 2014",,,,"cs.LG cs.CE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Background: Children are frequently prescribed medication off-label, meaning
there has not been sufficient testing of the medication to determine its safety
or effectiveness. The main reason this safety knowledge is lacking is due to
ethical restrictions that prevent children from being included in the majority
of clinical trials. Objective: The objective of this paper is to investigate
whether an ensemble of simple study designs can be implemented to signal
acutely occurring side effects effectively within the paediatric population by
using historical longitudinal data. The majority of pharmacovigilance
techniques are unsupervised, but this research presents a supervised framework.
Methods: Multiple measures of association are calculated for each drug and
medical event pair and these are used as features that are fed into a
classiffier to determine the likelihood of the drug and medical event pair
corresponding to an adverse drug reaction. The classiffier is trained using
known adverse drug reactions or known non-adverse drug reaction relationships.
Results: The novel ensemble framework obtained a false positive rate of 0:149,
a sensitivity of 0:547 and a specificity of 0:851 when implemented on a
reference set of drug and medical event pairs. The novel framework consistently
outperformed each individual simple study design. Conclusion: This research
shows that it is possible to exploit the mechanism of causality and presents a
framework for signalling adverse drug reactions effectively.

optimization problems for multi-agent systems, where objective functions are

a systematic approach for escaping a local optimum, rather than randomly
perturbing controllable variables away from it. We show that the objective
function for these problems can be decomposed to facilitate the evaluation of
the local partial derivative of each node in the system and to provide insights
into its structure. This structure is exploited by defining ""boosting
functions"" applied to the aforementioned local partial derivative at an
equilibrium point where its value is zero so as to transform it in a way that
induces nodes to explore poorly covered areas of the mission space until a new
equilibrium point is reached. The proposed boosting process ensures that, at
its conclusion, the objective function is no worse than its pre-boosting value.
However, the global optima cannot be guaranteed. We define three families of
boosting functions with different properties and provide simulation results

sodium absorption lines in some SN Ia to originate in a massive circumstellar
matter (CSM), as has been claimed recently, we use the results of Sternberg et
al. (2014) to imply that > ~20% of SN Ia occur inside a PN (or a PN
descendant), hence classify them as SNIPs. (ii) We next use results that show
that whenever there are hydrogen lines in SN Ia the hydrogen mass in the CSM is
large (> 1 M_Sun), hence the explosion is a SNIP. We make the simplest
assumption that the probability for explosion is constant in time for up to
about 10^5 yrs after the merger of the core with the white dwarf (WD) in the
frame of the core-degenerate scenario. This results with at least few x10 of
SNe Ia that may have a SNIP origin. (iii) We examine the X-ray morphologies of
13 well-resolved close-by SN remnants (SNRs) Ia and derive a crude upper limit,
according to which 10-30% of all SNRs Ia possess opposite ear-like features,
which we take as evidence of SNIP origin. Our results, together with several
other recent results, lead us to conclude that the two scenarios most
contributing to SNe Ia are the core degenerate and the double degenerate
scenarios. Together these two account for >95% of all SNe Ia.

globally. In the core of the LMC (LMC bar), a secondary, distinct episode is

field theory side, without using any supergravity equations of motion. Instead,
we rely on the addition of probe D-branes to the stack of D-branes generating
the background. From the field theory description of the probe branes, one can
compute an effective action for the probes (in a suitable
low-energy/near-horizon limit) by integrating out the background branes.
Comparing this action with the generic probe D-brane action then allows to
determine the holographic background dual to the considered field theory
vacuum.
  In the first part, the required pre-requisites of field and string theory are
recalled and this strategy to derive holographic backgrounds is explained in
more detail on the basic case of D3-branes in flat space probed by a small
number of D-instantons.
  The second part contains our original results, which have already appeared in
arXiv:1301.3738, arXiv:1301.7062 and arXiv:1312.0621. We first derive the duals
to three continuous deformations (Coulomb branch, $\beta$ and non-commutative
deformations) of N=4 super-Yang-Mills. We then derive the enhan\c{c}on
mechanism in a simple N=2 quiver gauge theory setup by using a fractional
D-instanton as a probe and exploiting recent exact results on the Coulomb
branch of N=2 quivers. Finally, we obtain the near-horizon D4-brane geometry by
probing the D4-branes with a small number of D0-branes.

to the radiative energy transfer for low temperatures and high electric field

energy transfer gives a significant contribution to the heat transfer, in
addition to the contribution from phononic coupling. For suspended graphene
(large separation) the corresponding radiative energy transfer coefficient at

properties of the CO and OH emission lines are consistent with our earlier
interpretation that these diagnostics provide indirect evidence for a companion
that orbits the star close to the disk wall (at ~13au). The asymmetry of the OH
spectral line profiles and their lack of time variability are consistent with
emission from gas in an eccentric orbit at the disk wall that is approximately
stationary in the inertial frame. The time variable spectroastrometric
properties of the CO v=1-0 emission line point to an orbiting source of CO
emission with an emitting area similar to that expected for a circumplanetary
disk (~0.1au^2) assuming the CO emission is optically thick. We also consider a
counterhypothesis to this interpretation, namely that the variable CO emission
arises from a bright spot on the disk wall. We conclude with a brief suggestion
of further work that can distinguish between these scenarios.

measurement on the qubit, which is valid for general entropic forms and becomes
exact in the limit of weak correlations. This entropy measures the average
conditional mixedness of the post-measurement state of the qudit, and its
minimum among all local measurements represents a generalized entanglement of
formation. In the case of the von Neumann entropy, it is directly related to
the quantum discord. It is shown that at the lowest non-trivial order, the
problem reduces to the minimization of a quadratic form determined by the
correlation tensor of the system, the Bloch vector of the qubit and the local
concavity of the entropy, requiring just the diagonalization of a $3\times 3$
matrix. A simple geometrical picture in terms of an associated correlation
ellipsoid is also derived, which illustrates the link between entropy
optimization and correlation access and which is exact for a quadratic entropy.
The approach enables a simple estimation of the quantum discord. Illustrative

distance of about 138 kpc, and showing evidence of tidal disruption. It is very
elongated and exhibits a velocity gradient of 16 +/- 3 km/s/kpc. Using this
data a possible orbit of Hercules has previously been deduced in the
literature. In this study we make use of a novel approach to find a best fit
model that follows the published orbit. Instead of using trial and error, we
use a systematic approach in order to find a model that fits multiple
observables simultaneously. As such, we investigate a much wider parameter
range of initial conditions and ensure we have found the best match possible.
Using a dark matter free progenitor that undergoes tidal disruption, our
best-fit model can simultaneously match the observed luminosity, central
surface brightness, effective radius, velocity dispersion, and velocity
gradient of Hercules. However, we find it is impossible to reproduce the
observed elongation and the position angle of Hercules at the same time in our
models. This failure persists even when we vary the duration of the simulation
significantly, and consider a more cuspy density distribution for the
progenitor. We discuss how this suggests that the published orbit of Hercules
is very likely to be incorrect.

of elegance of the setup and of the richness of the emerging phenomenology is
the Randall-Sundrum II model where one infinite extra spacelike dimension is
considered with an AdS topology, characterized by the warping effect caused by
the presence of a negative cosmological constant in the bulk. A major drawback
of this model is that despite numerous efforts no line element has ever been
found that could describe a stable, regular, realistic black hole. Finding a
smoothly behaved such solution supported by the presence of some more or less
conventional fields either in the bulk and/or on the brane is the core of the
black hole challenge. After a comprehensive presentation of the details of the

carrier, diffusing between magnetized injector and detector, spends a
considerable portion of time on the traps. This new feature of transport does
not affect the giant magnetoresistance, which is sensitive only to the mutual
orientation of magnetizations of the injector and detector. By contrast, the
presence of traps strongly affects the sensitivity of the spin transport to
external magnetic field perpendicular to the magnetizations of the electrodes

such a narrowing is that the spin precession takes place during the entire time

place only during diffusive motion between the subsequent traps. If the

comprehensive study of the M-MR correlation in two canonical systems: a
NiFe/Cu/FePt pseudo spin-valve (PSV) and a [Co/Cu]8 multilayer. In the PSV, due
to the large difference in switching fields and minimal interactions between
the NiFe and FePt layers, the M and MR show a simple one-to-one relationship
during reversal. In the [Co/Cu]8 multilayer, the correlation between the
magnetization reversal and MR evolution is more complex. This is primarily due
to the similar switching fields of, and interactions between, the constituent
Co layers. The FORC protocol accesses states with much higher spin disorders
and larger MR than those found along the conventional major loop field-cycle.
Unlike the M-FORC measurements, which only probe changes in the macroscopic
magnetization, the MR-FORCs are more sensitive to the microscopic domain
configurations, as those are most important in determining the resultant MR
effect size. This approach is generally applicable to spintronic systems to
realize the maximum spin-disorder and the largest MR.

pp. 1249-1267]. Our modifications are made under assumption of the spatial
heterogeneity of both the near-repeat victimization effect and the dispersal
strategy of criminal agents. We investigate pattern formations in the
reaction-advection-diffusion systems with nonlinear diffusion over
multi-dimensional bounded domains subject to homogeneous Neumann boundary
conditions. It is shown that the positive homogeneous steady state loses its
stability as the intrinsic near-repeat victimization rate $\epsilon$ decreases
and spatially nonconstant solutions emerge through bifurcation. Moreover, we
find the wavemode selection mechanism through rigorous stability analysis of
these nontrivial patterns, which shows that the only stable pattern must have
wavenumber that maximizes the bifurcation value. Based on this wavemode
selection mechanism, we will be able to precisely predict the formation of
stable aggregates of the house attractiveness and criminal population density,
at least when the diffusion rate $\epsilon$ is around the principal bifurcation
value. Our theoretical results also suggest that large domains support more
stable aggregates than small domains. Finally, we perform extensive numerical
simulations over 1D intervals and 2D squares to illustrate and verify our
theoretical findings. Our numerics also include some interesting phenomena such
as the merging of two interior spikes and the emerging of new spikes, etc.
These nontrivial solutions can model the well observed aggregation phenomenon

are consistent with previous claims by Dittrich and Ryan, and extend their
validity to Lorentzian signature and arbitrary cellular decompositions. We show
in particular how the (gauge-invariant version of the) twist angle xi featuring
in twisted geometries equals on-shell the Regge dihedral angle multiplied by
the Immirzi parameter, thus recovering the discrete extrinsic geometry from the
Ashtekar-Barbero holonomy. Finally, we confirm that flatness implies both the
Levi-Civita and the shape-matching conditions using twisted geometries and a
4-dimensional version of the vertex condition appearing in 't Hooft's polygon
model.

properties (i.e., star formation rate, stellar mass, internal extinction due to
dust.). With these data, we find color-color relationships and correlated

dust properties, optical color and specific star formation rate, and
ultraviolet-infrared color and metallicity). The SEDs are binned by different
galaxy properties to reveal how each property affects the observed shape of
these SEDs. In addition, due to the volume-limited nature of LVL, we utilize
the dwarf-dominated galaxy sample to test star formation relationships
established with higher-mass galaxy samples. We find good agreement with the
star-forming ""main-sequence"" relationship, but find a systematic deviation in
the infrared ""main-sequence"" at low luminosities. This deviation is attributed
to suppressed polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) formation in low
metallicity environments and/or the destruction of PAHs in more intense

exposure per person which does not allow for adjustment for exposure-related
uncertainty. Here, we propose a Bayesian model averaging method to properly
quantify the relationship between radiation dose and disease outcomes by
accounting for shared and unshared uncertainty in estimated dose. Our Bayesian
risk analysis method utilizes multiple realizations of sets (vectors) of doses
generated by a two-dimensional Monte Carlo simulation method that properly
separates shared and unshared errors in dose estimation. The exposure model
used in this work is taken from a study of the risk of thyroid nodules among a
cohort of 2,376 subjects following exposure to fallout resulting from nuclear
testing in Kazakhstan. We assessed the performance of our method through an
extensive series of simulation tests and comparisons against conventional
regression risk analysis methods. We conclude that when estimated doses contain
relatively small amounts of uncertainty, the Bayesian method using multiple
realizations of possibly true dose vectors gave similar results to the
conventional regression-based methods of dose-response analysis. However, when
large and complex mixtures of shared and unshared uncertainties are present,
the Bayesian method using multiple dose vectors had significantly lower
relative bias than conventional regression-based risk analysis methods as well
as a markedly increased capability to include the pre-established 'true' risk
coefficient within the credible interval of the Bayesian-based risk estimate.
An evaluation of the dose-response using our method is presented for an
epidemiological study of thyroid disease following radiation exposure.

range $30<m_U<90$ MeV/$c^2$. Combined with other experimental limits, the
remaining region in the $U$-$\gamma$ mixing parameter space that can explain

growth of structure from the time of horizon entry and radiation-matter
equality to the formation of stars and galaxies. This cannot be explained by
using general relativity without dark matter. So far, dark matter particles
have not been detected in laboratory measurements or at the LHC. We demonstrate
that enhanced structure growth can happen in a modified gravity theory (MOG).
The vector field and particle introduced in the theory to explain galaxy and
cluster dynamics plays an important role in generating the required structure
growth. The particle called the phion (a light hidden photon) is neutral and is
a dominant, pressureless component in the MOG Friedmann equations, before the
time of decoupling. The dominant energy density of the phion particle in the
early universe, generates an explanation for the growth of density
perturbations. The angular acoustical power spectrum due to baryon-photon
pressure waves is in agreement with the Planck 2013 data. As the universe
expands and large scale structures are formed, the density of baryons dominates
and the rotation curves of galaxies and the dynamics of clusters are explained
in MOG, when the phion particle in the present universe is ultra-light. The
matter power spectrum determined by the theory is in agreement with current
galaxy redshift surveys.

principles, i.e., without the need for any post-processing or correction steps.
This algorithm recovers, at a fundamental level, the scatter-gather algorithms
presented recently by Campos-Pinto et al. [1] (to first-order) and by Squire et
al. [2], but it is derived here in a streamlined fashion from a geometric
viewpoint. Some ingredients reflecting this viewpoint are (1) the use of
(discrete) differential forms of various degrees to represent fields, currents,
and charged particles and provide localization rules for the degrees of freedom
thereof on the various grid elements (nodes, edges, facets), (2) use of Whitney
forms as basic interpolants from discrete differential forms to continuum
space, and (3) use of a Galerkin formula for the discrete Hodge star operators
(i.e., ""mass matrices"" incorporating the metric datum of the grid) applicable
to generally irregular, unstructured grids. The expressions obtained for the
scatter charges and scatter currents are very concise and do not involve
numerical quadrature rules. Appropriate fractional areas within each grid
element are identified that represent scatter charges and scatter currents
within the element, and a simple geometric representation for the (exact)
charge conservation mechanism is obtained by such identification. The field
update is based on the coupled first-order Maxwell's curl equations to avoid
spurious modes with secular growth (otherwise present in formulations that
discretize the second-order wave equation). Examples are provided to verify
preservation of discrete Gauss' law for all times.

~ 30,000 K, neutral hydrogen fraction ~ 0.5) are ideal for producing
Lyman-alpha emission via collisional excitation of hydrogen atoms. Observations
of this emission, which could subtend >10 arcmin$^2$ on the sky, would
definitively demonstrate the presence of a neutral intergalactic medium at the
observed epoch, placing valuable constraints on the progress of reionization.
We find that the expected Lyman-alpha surface brightness is significantly
weaker than previously determined and may be impossible to observe with current
and near-future instruments. Past work calculated the Lyman-alpha emission from
a quasar ionization front in a homogeneous medium with a clumping factor
approximation to account for inhomogeneities. We find using 1D radiative
transfer calculations that this approximation overestimates the emission by a
factor of >3. Our calculations model the propagation of ionizing photons and
compute the Lyman-alpha emission from quasar ionization fronts on sightlines
from a hydrodynamic cosmological simulation at z = 7.1. To better understand
the physical properties of the emission, we also develop an analytic model that
accurately describes the results of the full radiative transfer calculation.

stars to determine the shock-heating rate due to instabilities in their
radiation-driven winds. The high densities of these winds means that their
embedded shocks quickly cool by local radiative emission, while cooling by
expansion should be negligible. Ignoring for simplicity any non-radiative
mixing or conductive cooling, the method presented here exploits the idea that
the cooling post-shock plasma systematically passes through the temperature
characteristic of distinct emission lines in the X-ray spectrum. In this way,
the observed flux distribution among these X-ray lines can be used to construct
the cumulative probability distribution of shock strengths that a typical wind
parcel encounters as it advects through the wind. We apply this new method
(Gayley 2014) to Chandra grating spectra from five O stars with X-ray emission
indicative of embedded wind shocks in effectively single massive stars.
Correcting for wind absorption of the X-ray line emission is a crucial
component of our analysis, and we use wind optical depth values derived from
X-ray line-profile fitting (Cohen et al. 2014) in order to make that
correction. The shock-heating rate results we derive for all the stars are
quite similar: the average wind mass element passes through roughly one shock
that heats it to at least $10^6$ K as it advects through the wind, and the
cumulative distribution of shock strengths is a strongly decreasing function of
temperature, consistent with a negative power-law of index $n \approx 3$,
implying a marginal distribution of shock strengths that scales as $T^{-4}$,
and with hints of an even steeper decline or cut-off above $10^7$ K.

on squashed lens spaces L(k,1). At any k, they admit a
holomorphic-antiholomorphic factorization, corresponding to the decomposition
of L(k,1) into two solid tori, and the associated holomorphic block

fractions by determining the dynamical masses from Jeans modelling of galaxy
aperture velocity dispersions and the $M_{\star}$ from galaxy colours, and
compare the results with local samples. We discuss how the correlations of
central DM with galaxy size (i.e. the effective radius, $R_{\rm e}$),
$M_{\star}$ and $\sigma_{\star}$ evolve as a function of redshift, finding
clear indications that local galaxies are, on average, more DM dominated than
their counterparts at larger redshift. This DM fraction evolution with $z$ can
be only partially interpreted as a consequence of the size-redshift evolution.
We discuss our results within galaxy formation scenarios, and conclude that the
growth in size and DM content which we measure within the last 7 Gyr is
incompatible with passive evolution, while it is well reproduced in the
multiple minor merger scenario. We also discuss the impact of the IMF on our DM
inferences and argue that this can be non-universal with the lookback time. In

those galaxies are faint, and the difference in the SFR is minute, and
therefore it is challenging to detect it in real galaxies given the current

spectral subtype calibration was computed. Possible giants were identified by a
$(J-K_s, H_{J})$ reduced proper motion diagram. The light curves of
12.8<$K_s$<15.8 colour-selected M dwarfs were inspected for signals consistent
with transiting objects. We identified 23,345 objects in VVV b201 with colours
consistent with M dwarfs. We provided their spectral types and photometric
distances, up to $\sim$ 300 pc for M9s and $\sim$ 1.2 kpc for M4s, from
photometry. In the range 12<$K_s$<16, we identified 753 stars as possible
giants out of 9,232 M dwarf candidates. While only the first 26 epochs of VVV
were available, and 1 epoch was excluded, we were already able to identify
transit-like signals in the light curves of 95 M dwarfs and of 12 possible
giants. Thanks to its deeper photometry ($\sim$4 magnitudes deeper than 2MASS),
the VVV survey will be a major contributor to the discovery and study of M
dwarfs and possible companions towards the center of the Milky Way.

analysis requires efficient data compression. Calculating accurate covariances
is extremely challenging with increasing number of statistics used. Here we
introduce a formalism for achieving efficient data compression, based on a
local expansion of statistical measures around a fiducial cosmological model.
We specifically apply and test this approach for the case of cosmic shear
statistics. We demonstrate the performance of our approach, using a Fisher
analysis on cosmic shear tomography described in terms of E-/B-mode separating
statistics (COSEBIs). We show that our data compression is highly effective in
extracting essentially the full cosmological information from a strongly
reduced number of observables. Specifically, the number of statistics needed
decreases by at least one order of magnitude relative to the COSEBIs, which
already compress the data substantially compared to the shear two-point
correlation functions. The efficiency appears to be affected only slightly if a
highly inaccurate covariance is used for defining the compressed statistics,
showing the robustness of the method. We conclude that an efficient data
compression is achievable and that the number of compressed statistics depends
on the number of model parameters.
  In addition, we study how well band powers can be obtained from measuring
shear correlation functions over a finite interval of separations. We show the
strong limitations on the possibility to construct top-hat filters in Fourier
space, for which the real-space analog has a finite support, yielding strong
bounds on the accuracy of band power estimates. The error on an estimated
band-power is larger for a narrower filter and a smaller angular range which
for relevant cases can be as large as 10%.

the two approaches. We show that saddle-point methods enable a direct
quantitative comparison despite the fact that the scale which is resummed in
the two approaches is not the same. As a byproduct, we put in one-to-one
analytic correspondence various features of either approach: specifically, we
show how the SCET method for treating the Landau pole can be implemented in
dQCD, and how the resummation of the optimal partonic scale of dQCD can be
implemented in SCET. We conclude that the main quantitative difference comes
from power-suppressed subleading contributions, which could in fact be freely
tuned in either approach, and not really characteristic of either. This
conclusion holds for Higgs production in gluon fusion, but it is in fact
generic for processes with similar kinematics. For Higgs production, everything
else being equal, SCET resummation at NNLL in the Becher-Neubert implementation
leads to essentially no enhancement of the NNLO cross-section, unlike dQCD in

new information on hadron structure appear as building blocks in the collinear
factorized description for several types of hard exclusive reactions. In this
paper, we address the possibility of accessing nucleon-to-pion ($\pi N$) TDAs
from $\bar{p}p \to e^+e^- \pi^0$ reaction with the future \={P}ANDA detector at
the FAIR facility. At high center of mass energy and high invariant mass
squared of the lepton pair $q^2$, the amplitude of the signal channel $\bar{p}p
\to e^+e^- \pi^0$ admits a QCD factorized description in terms of $\pi N$ TDAs
and nucleon Distribution Amplitudes (DAs) in the forward and backward kinematic
regimes. Assuming the validity of this factorized description, we perform
feasibility studies for measuring $\bar{p}p \to e^+e^- \pi^0$ with the
\={P}ANDA detector. Detailed simulations on signal reconstruction efficiency as
well as on rejection of the most severe background channel, i.e. $\bar{p}p \to
\pi^+\pi^- \pi^0$ were performed for the center of mass energy squared $s = 5$
GeV$^2$ and $s = 10$ GeV$^2$, in the kinematic regions $3.0 < q^2 < 4.3$
GeV$^2$ and $5 < q^2 < 9$ GeV$^2$, respectively, with a neutral pion scattered
in the forward or backward cone $| \cos\theta_{\pi^0}| > 0.5 $ in the
proton-antiproton center of mass frame. Results of the simulation show that the
particle identification capabilities of the \={P}ANDA detector will allow to
achieve a background rejection factor of $5\cdot 10^7$ ($1\cdot 10^7$) at low
(high) $q^2$ for $s=5$ GeV$^2$, and of $1\cdot 10^8$ ($6\cdot 10^6$) at low
(high) $q^2$ for $s=10$ GeV$^2$, while keeping the signal reconstruction
efficiency at around $40\%$. At both energies, a clean lepton signal can be
reconstructed with the expected statistics corresponding to $2$ fb$^{-1}$ of
integrated luminosity. (.../...)

star evolution suggests that young globular clusters may have formed hundreds
to thousands of stellar-mass black holes, the remnants of stars with initial
masses from $\sim 20 - 100\, M_\odot$. Birth kicks from supernova explosions
may eject some black holes from their birth clusters, but most should be
retained. Using a Monte Carlo method we investigate the long-term dynamical
evolution of globular clusters containing large numbers of stellar black holes.
We describe numerical results for 42 models, covering a range of realistic
initial conditions, including up to $1.6\times10^6$ stars. In almost all models
we find that significant numbers of black holes (up to $\sim10^3$) are retained
all the way to the present. This is in contrast to previous theoretical
expectations that most black holes should be ejected dynamically within a few
Gyr. The main reason for this difference is that core collapse driven by black
holes (through the Spitzer ""mass segregation instability"") is easily reverted
through three-body processes, and involves only a small number of the most
massive black holes, while lower-mass black holes remain well-mixed with
ordinary stars far from the central cusp. Thus the rapid segregation of stellar
black holes does not lead to a long-term physical separation of most black
holes into a dynamically decoupled inner core, as often assumed previously.
Combined with the recent detections of several black hole X-ray binary
candidates in Galactic globular clusters, our results suggest that stellar
black holes could still be present in large numbers in many globular clusters
today, and that they may play a significant role in shaping the long-term
dynamical evolution and the present-day dynamical structure of many clusters.

main focus is on configurations with exactly two broken supersymmetries, since
they frequently appear in consistent truncations of string theory and
supergravity. Evaluating one-loop corrections to the Chern-Simons terms we find
necessary conditions to ensure that a consistent truncation also gives rise to
a proper effective action of an underlying more fundamental theory. To obtain
concrete examples, we determine the N=4 action of M-theory on six-dimensional
SU(2)-structure manifolds with background fluxes. Calabi-Yau threefolds with
vanishing Euler number are examples of SU(2)-structure manifolds that yield N=2
Minkowski vacua. We find that that one-loop corrections to the Chern-Simons
terms vanish trivially and thus do not impose constraints on identifying
effective theories. This result is traced back to the absence of isometries on
these geometries. Examples with isometries arise from type IIB supergravity on
squashed Sasaki-Einstein manifolds. In this case the one-loop gauge
Chern-Simons terms vanish due to non-trivial cancellations, while the one-loop
gravitational Chern-Simons terms are non-zero.

behaviors: an oscillator can never truly be at rest. Even in its lowest energy
state, at a temperature of absolute zero, its position and momentum are still
subject to quantum fluctuations. Resolving these fluctuations using linear
position measurements is complicated by the fact that classical noise can
masquerade as quantum noise. On the other hand, direct energy detection of the
oscillator in its ground state makes it appear motionless. So how can we
resolve quantum fluctuations? Here, we parametrically couple a micromechanical
oscillator to a microwave cavity to prepare the system in its quantum ground
state and then amplify the remaining vacuum fluctuations into real energy
quanta. Exploiting a superconducting qubit as an artificial atom, we measure

strong signal gains, resilience to imperfect channel knowledge, and low

low-cost antenna branches with low circuit power, in contrast to today's
conventional expensive and power-hungry BS antenna branches. Such low-cost
transceivers are prone to hardware imperfections, but it has been conjectured

we derive closed-form expressions for the user rates and a scaling law that
shows how fast the hardware imperfections can increase with $N$ while
maintaining high rates. The connection between this scaling law and the power

reveals that one can make the circuit power increase as $\sqrt{N}$, instead of

are commonly considered to relatively compare various projects. However, as the
degree of penetration of a project in the baseline increases, the popular
marginal assumption does no longer hold, and the differential impacts may
become inconsistent. Although various mythologies have been successfully

initiates the assessment from the project itself and ultimately widens the

This is highly relevant in terms of ICT's disruptive and dynamic technologies

range of orbits in a Milky Way-like potential to study the effects of orbital

galactocentric distances Rgc, a non-zero inclination results in increased mass
loss rates. Tidal heating and disk shocking, the latter sometimes consisting of
two shocking events as the cluster moves towards and away from the disk, help
remove stars from the cluster. Clusters with inclined orbits at large Rgc have
decreased mass loss rates than the non-inclined case, since the strength the
disk potential decreases with Rgc. Clusters with inclined and eccentric orbits
experience increased tidal heating due to a constantly changing potential,
weaker disk shocks since passages occur at higher Rgc, and an additional tidal
shock at perigalacticon. The effects of orbital inclination decrease with
orbital eccentricity, as a highly eccentric cluster spends the majority of its
lifetime at a large Rgc. The limiting radii of clusters with inclined orbits
are best represented by the rt of the cluster when at its maximum height above
the disk, where the cluster spends the majority of its lifetime and the rate of
change in rt is a minimum. Conversely, the effective radius is independent of

where peculiar velocity flows diverge, as water does at watershed divides, and
we trace the surface of divergent points that surrounds us. Within the volume
enclosed by this surface, the motions of galaxies are inward after removal of

highest energy is an important task in astrophysics. It is common and useful to
partition the sky into spherical harmonics as a measure of anisotropy. The two
lowest nontrivial spherical harmonics, the dipole and the quadrupole, are of
particular interest, since these distributions encapsulate a dominant single
source and a plane of sources, as well as offering relatively high statistics.
The best experiments for the detection of ultra high energy cosmic rays
currently are all ground-based, with highly nonuniform exposures on the sky
resulting from the fixed experimental locations on the earth. This nonuniform
exposure increases the complexity and error in inferring anisotropies. It turns
out that there is an optimal latitude for an experiment at which nonuniform
exposure does not diminish the inference of the quadrupole moment. We derive
the optimal latitude, and find that (presumably by a fortuitous coincidence)
this optimal latitude runs through the largest cosmic ray experiment, Pierre
Auger Observatory (PAO) in the Southern Hemisphere, and close to the largest
cosmic ray experiment in the Northern Hemisphere, Telescope Array (TA).
Consequently, assuming a quadrupole distribution, PAO and TA can reconstruct
the cosmic ray quadrupole distribution to a high precision, without concern for
their partial sky exposure.

also conjecture that physically interesting processes such as gravitational

of two service stations and two controllers is investigated. Each controller is
affiliated with one station. Each station has an infinite size buffer.
Exogenous customer arrivals at each station occur with rate $\lambda$. Service
times at each station have rate $\mu$. At any time, a controller can route one
of the customers waiting in its own station to the other station. Each
controller knows perfectly the queue length in its own station and observes the
exogenous arrivals to its own station as well as the arrivals of customers sent
from the other station. At the beginning, each controller has a probability
mass function (PMF) on the number of customers in the other station. These PMFs
are common knowledge between the two controllers. At each time a holding cost
is incurred at each station due to the customers waiting at that station. The
objective is to determine routing policies for the two controllers that
minimize either the total expected holding cost over a finite horizon or the
average cost per unit time over an infinite horizon. In this problem there is
implicit communication between the two controllers; whenever a controller
decides to send or not to send a customer from its own station to the other
station it communicates information about its queue length to the other
station. This implicit communication through control actions is referred to as
signaling in decentralized control. Signaling results in complex communication
and decision problems. In spite of the complexity of signaling involved, it is
shown that an optimal signaling strategy is described by a threshold policy
which depends on the common information between the two controllers; this
threshold policy is explicitly determined.

of host stars and evaluate the previous claim that planet hosts exhibit lithium
depletion when compared to their non-host counterparts.
  Methods. Using previously published lithium abundances, we remove the
confounding effect of the different fundamental stellar parameters by applying
a multivariable regression on our dataset. In doing so, we explicitly make an
assumption made implicitly by different authors: that lithium abundance depends
linearly on fundamental stellar parameters. Using a moderator variable to
distinguish stars with planets from those without, we evaluate the existence of
an offset in lithium abundances between the two groups. We perform this
analysis first for stars that present a clear lithium detection exclusively and
include in a second analysis upper lithium measurements.
  Results. Our analysis shows that under the above-mentioned assumption of
linearity, a statistically significant negative offset in lithium abundance
between planet hosts and non-hosts is recovered. We concluded that an inflation
on the lithium uncertainty estimations by a factor of larger than 5 is required
to render the measured offset compatible with zero at less than 3-4 {\sigma}
and make it non-significant. We demonstrated that the offset as delivered by
our method depends on the different nature of the stars in the two samples. We
did so by showing that the offset is reduced down to zero if the planet-host

still significant when one imposes different constraints on the dataset, such
as a limit in planetary mass or constrain the host temperature to around solar

Of our eight hard X-ray selected AGN, we find that optical normalcy has a

objects have normal Eddington ratios, and so are unlikely to host
radiatively-inefficient accretion flows (RIAFs). It is unlikely that star
formation in the host or starlight dilution is contributing to their failure of
optical diagnostics, except perhaps in two cases. The NIR continua are well-fit
by two blackbodies: one at the stellar temperature, and a hot dust component
near the dust sublimation temperature. XBONGs are more likely to have
significant hot dust components, while these components are small relative to
starlight in the optically-elusive AGN. Some of our sample have NIR line ratios
typical of AGN, but NIR diagnostics are unsuccessful in distinguishing HII

alignments is well established, and is an increasingly pervasive feature of
datasets composed of gene regions sampled from multiple loci and/or different

model the underlying process heterogeneity; failure to do so can lead to biased
estimates of phylogeny and other parameters. Traditionally, process
heterogeneity has been accommodated by first assigning sites to data subsets
based on relevant prior information (reflecting codon positions in
protein-coding DNA, stem and loop regions of ribosomal DNA, etc.), and then
estimating the phylogeny and other model parameters under the resulting mixed
model. Here, we consider an alternative approach for accommodating process
heterogeneity that is similar in spirit to this conventional mixed-model
approach. However, rather than treating the partitioning scheme as a fixed
assumption of the analysis, we treat the process partition as a random variable
using a Dirichlet process prior model, where the phylogeny is estimated by
integrating over all possible process partitions for the specified data
subsets. We apply this method to simulated and empirical datasets, and compare
our results to those estimated previously using conventional mixed-model
selection criteria based on Bayes factors. We find that estimation under the
Dirichlet process prior model discovers novel process partitions that may more
effectively balance error variance and estimation bias, while rendering
phylogenetic inference more robust to process heterogeneity by virtue of
integrating estimates over all possible partition schemes. (Keywords: Bayesian

a particularly challenging class of big data problems. Many application areas
are moving toward exascale computing systems, systems that perform $10^{18}$
FLOPS (FLoating-point Operations Per Second) --- a billion billion calculations

storage capacity and the bandwidth available for transfer to storage, making
post-processing and analysis challenging. One approach is to embed some

strategy is to save only a reduced set of time steps rather than the full

combines both of these ideas to introduce an online in situ method for

exact distribution function of extended delivery time of a fixed-size secondary
packet with non-work-preserving strategy i.e. interrupted packets will be
retransmitted. Both continuous sensing and periodic sensing with and without
missed detection cases are considered. Selected numerical and simulation

ionization gas arises in sub-kiloparsec ""cloud"" structures, but high ionization
gas arises in multiple extended structures spread over 100 kpc; due to complex

that HI absorption selected gas and OVI absorption gas arise in totally

we study the evolution of representative droplets using a model that includes
rotation and stretching effects from the surrounding fluid, and restoration
effects from surface tension including a constant droplet volume constraint,
while assuming that the droplets maintain an ellipsoidal shape. The model is
combined with Lagrangian time histories of the velocity gradient tensor
extracted from DNS of turbulence to obtain simulated droplet evolutions. These
are used to characterize the size, shape and orientation statistics of small
droplets in turbulence. A critical capillary number, $Ca_c$ is identified
associated with unbounded growth of one or two of the droplet's semi-axes.
Exploiting analogies with dynamics of polymers in turbulence, the $Ca_c$ number
can be predicted based on the large deviation theory for the largest Finite
Time Lyapunov exponent. Also, for sub-critical $Ca$ the theory enables
predictions of the slope of the power-law tails of droplet size distributions
in turbulence. For cases when the viscosities of droplet and outer fluid differ
in a way that enables vorticity to decorrelate the shape from the straining

humans to do so, CAPTCHAs take advantage of the reverse Turing test (TT),
knowing that humans are more intelligent than machines. Generally, CAPTCHAs
have defeated machines, but things are changing rapidly as technology improves.
Hence, advanced research into optical character recognition (OCR) is overtaking
attempts to strengthen CAPTCHAs against machine-based attacks. This paper
investigates the immunity of CAPTCHA, which was built on the failure of the TT.
We show that some CAPTCHAs are easily broken using a simple OCR machine built
for the purpose of this study. By reviewing other techniques, we show that even
more difficult CAPTCHAs can be broken using advanced OCR machines. Current
advances in OCR should enable machines to pass the TT in the image recognition
domain, which is exactly where machines are seeking to overcome CAPTCHAs. We
enhance traditional CAPTCHAs by employing not only characters, but also natural
language and multiple objects within the same CAPTCHA. The proposed CAPTCHAs
might be able to hold out against machines, at least until the advent of a
machine that passes the TT completely.

wireless communications networks is a very complex problem. The Local Pooling
(LoP) factor provides a single-parameter means of expressing the achievable
capacity region (and optimality) of one such scheme, greedy maximal scheduling
(GMS). The exact LoP factor for an arbitrary network graph is generally
difficult to obtain, but may be evaluated or bounded based on the network
graph's particular structure. In this paper, we provide rigorous
characterizations of the LoP factor in large networks modeled as
Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi (ER) and random geometric (RG) graphs under the primary
interference model. We employ threshold functions to establish critical values
for either the edge probability or communication radius to yield useful bounds
on the range and expectation of the LoP factor as the network grows large. For
sufficiently dense random graphs, we find that the LoP factor is between 1/2
and 2/3, while sufficiently sparse random graphs permit GMS optimality (the LoP
factor is 1) with high probability. We then place LoP within a larger context
of commonly studied random graph properties centered around connectedness. We
observe that edge densities permitting connectivity generally admit cycle
subgraphs which forms the basis for the LoP factor upper bound of 2/3. We
conclude with simulations to explore the regime of small networks, which

methods for solving classification problems. Despite its popularity, SVM has a
serious drawback, that is sensitivity to outliers in training samples. The
penalty on misclassification is defined by a convex loss called the hinge loss,
and the unboundedness of the convex loss causes the sensitivity to outliers. To
deal with outliers, robust variants of SVM have been proposed, such as the
robust outlier detection algorithm and an SVM with a bounded loss called the
ramp loss. In this paper, we propose a robust variant of SVM and investigate
its robustness in terms of the breakdown point. The breakdown point is a
robustness measure that is the largest amount of contamination such that the
estimated classifier still gives information about the non-contaminated data.
The main contribution of this paper is to show an exact evaluation of the
breakdown point for the robust SVM. For learning parameters such as the
regularization parameter in our algorithm, we derive a simple formula that
guarantees the robustness of the classifier. When the learning parameters are
determined with a grid search using cross validation, our formula works to
reduce the number of candidate search points. The robustness of the proposed
method is confirmed in numerical experiments. We show that the statistical
properties of the robust SVM are well explained by a theoretical analysis of
the breakdown point.

theories extend to clouds in high-pressure (P/k > 10^7 K cm^-3) environments,
like those in the Galaxy's inner 200 pc Central Molecular Zone (CMZ) and in the
early Universe. Here we present ALMA 3mm dust continuum emission within a
cloud, G0.253+0.016, which is immersed in the high-pressure environment of the
CMZ. While the log-normal shape and dispersion of its column density PDF is
strikingly similar to those of solar neighbourhood clouds, there is one
important quantitative difference: its mean column density is 1--2 orders of
magnitude higher. Both the similarity and difference in the PDF compared to
those derived from solar neighbourhood clouds match predictions of turbulent
cloud models given the high-pressure environment of the CMZ. The PDF shows a
small deviation from log-normal at high column densities confirming the youth
of G0.253+0.016. Its lack of star formation is consistent with the
theoretically predicted, environmentally dependent volume density threshold for
star formation which is orders of magnitude higher than that derived for solar
neighbourhood clouds. Our results provide the first empirical evidence that the
current theoretical understanding of molecular cloud structure derived from the
solar neighbourhood also holds in high-pressure environments. We therefore
suggest that these theories may be applicable to understand star formation in

we show the time it takes a person to move between rooms in their home denoted
'transition times' can predict gait velocity when estimated from passive
infrared motion detectors installed in a patient's own home. Using a support
vector regression approach to model the relationship between transition times
and gait velocities, we show that velocity can be predicted with an average
error less than 2.5 cm/sec. This is demonstrated with data collected over a 5
year period from 74 older adults monitored in their own homes. This method is
simple and cost effective, and has advantages over competing approaches such
as: obtaining 20 to100x more gait velocity measurements per day, and offering
the fusion of location specific information with time stamped gait estimates.
These advantages allow stable estimates of gait parameters (maximum or average
speed, variability) at shorter time scales than current approaches. This also
provides a pervasive in home method for context aware gait velocity sensing

focusing on optical techniques due to their particular relevance for biological
imaging, sensing, and stimulation. Our understanding of quantum mechanics has
already enabled important applications in biology, including positron emission
tomography (PET) with entangled photons, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) using
nuclear magnetic resonance, and bio-magnetic imaging with superconducting
quantum interference devices (SQUIDs). In quantum metrology an even greater
range of applications arise from the ability to not just understand, but to
engineer, coherence and correlations at the quantum level. In the past few
years, quite dramatic progress has been seen in applying these ideas into
biological systems. Capabilities that have been demonstrated include enhanced
sensitivity and resolution, immunity to imaging artifacts and technical noise,
and characterization of the biological response to light at the single-photon
level. New quantum measurement techniques offer even greater promise, raising
the prospect for improved multi-photon microscopy and magnetic imaging, among
many other possible applications. Realization of this potential will require
cross-disciplinary input from researchers in both biology and quantum physics.

is to determine the largest possible minimum distance for LRCs. First, an
integer programming based upper bound is derived for any LRC. Then by solving
the programming problem under certain conditions, an explicit upper bound is
obtained for LRCs with parameters $n_1>n_2$, where $n_1 = \left\lceil
\frac{n}{r+1} \right\rceil$ and $n_2 = n_1 (r+1) - n$. Finally, an explicit
construction for LRCs attaining this upper bound is presented over the finite
field $\mathbb{F}_{2^m}$, where $m\geq n_1r$. Based on these results, the
largest possible minimum distance for all LRCs with $r \le \sqrt{n}-1$ has been
definitely determined, which is of great significance in practical use.

interest to a wide range of disciplines, most notably the atmospheric sciences.
In this work, we use molecular dynamics and two advanced sampling techniques,
forward flux sampling and umbrella sampling, to study homogeneous nucleation of
ice in free-standing thin films of supercooled water. We use a coarse-grained
monoatomic model of water, known as mW, and we find that in this model a
vapor-liquid interface suppresses crystallization in its vicinity. This
suppression occurs in the vicinity of flat interfaces where no net Laplace
pressure in induced. Our free energy calculations reveal that the pre-critical
crystalline nuclei that emerge near the interface are thermodynamically less
stable than those that emerge in the bulk. We investigate the origin of this
instability by computing the average asphericity of nuclei that form in
different regions of the film, and observe that average asphericity increases
closer to the interface, which is consistent with an increase in the free
energy due to increased surface-to-volume ratios.

for a variety of mechanical and physical phenomena. The focus of the present
work is on capillarity, a pore-scale process occurring at the micron scale. We
attempt to characterize the influence of pore shape for capillary infiltration
by means of Lattice Boltzmann simulations in 2D with reactive boundaries
leading to surface growth and ultimately to pore closure. The systems under
investigation consist of single channels with different simplified
morphologies: namely, periodic profiles with sinusoidal, step-shaped and
zig-zag walls, as well as constrictions and expansions with rectangular, convex
and concave steps. This is a useful way to decompose the complexity of typical
porous media into basic structures. The simulations show that the minimum
radius alone fails to characterize properly the infiltration dynamics. The
structure of the channels emerge as the dominant property controlling the
process. A factor responsible for this behavior is identified as being the
occurrence of pinning of the contact line. It turns out that the optimal
configuration for the pore structure arises from the packing of large particles
with round shapes. In this case, the probability to have flow paths wide and
straight is higher. Faceted surfaces presenting sharp edges should be avoided
because of the phenomenon of pinning near narrow-to-wide parts. This study is
motivated by the infiltration of molten metals into carbon preforms. This is a
manufacturing technique for ceramic components devised to advanced
applications. Guidelines for experimental work are discussed.

reported geometric method for representing, visualizing, sampling and computing
integrals over the potential energy landscape tailored for small molecular
assemblies. EASAL's efficiency arises from the fact that small assembly
landscapes permit the use of so-called Cayley parameters (inter-atomic
distances) for geometric representation and sampling of the assembly
configuration space regions; this results in their isolation, convexification,
customized sampling and systematic traversal using a comprehensive topological
roadmap, ensuring reasonable coverage of crucial but narrow regions of low
effective dimension.
  However, this alone is inadequate for accurate computation of configurational
entropy and other integrals, required for estimation of both free energy and
kinetics - where it is essential to obtain uniform sampling in appropriate
cartesian or moduli space parameterization. Standard adjustment of Cayley
sampling via the Jacobian of the map between the two parameterizations is
fraught with challenges stemming from an illconditioned Jacobian.
  This paper formalizes and analyzes these challenges to provide modifications
to EASAL that secure the advantages of Cayley sampling while ensuring certain
minimum distance and coverage relationships between sampled configurations - in
Cartesian space. The modified EASAL's performance is compared with the basic

obtained by seeking a nonnegative low-rank and sparse matrix that represents
each data sample as a linear combination of others. The so-obtained NNLRS-graph
can capture both the global mixture of subspaces structure (by the low
rankness) and the locally linear structure (by the sparseness) of the data,
hence is both generative and discriminative. Secondly, as good features are
extremely important for constructing a good graph, we propose to learn the data
embedding matrix and construct the graph jointly within one framework, which is
termed as NNLRS with embedded features (referred to as NNLRS-EF). Extensive
experiments on three publicly available datasets demonstrate that the proposed

However, using the nonequilibrium Green's function (NEGF) method and analytical
modeling, we show that there exists a critical crossover length scale ($L_{C}$)
below which ballistic heat conduction ($\kappa\propto L$) can coexist with mass
disorder. This ballistic-to-subballistic heat conduction crossover is connected
to the exponential attenuation of the phonon transmittance function $\Xi$ i.e.
$\Xi(\omega,L)=\exp[-L/\lambda(\omega)]$, where $\lambda$ is the
frequency-dependent attenuation length. The crossover length can be determined
from the minimum attenuation length which depends on the maximum transmitted
frequency. We numerically determine the dependence of the transmittance on
frequency and mass composition as well as derive a closed form estimate which
agrees closely with the numerical results. For the length-dependent thermal
conductance, we also derive a closed form expression which agrees closely with
numerical results and reproduces the ballistic to subballistic thermal
conduction crossover. This allows us to characterize the crossover in terms of
changes in the length, mass composition and temperature dependence, and also to
determine the conditions under which heat conduction enters the ballistic

Furthermore, we find that the thermal conductance anisotropy with the
orientation can be tuned by applying strain. In particular, the zigzag-oriented
thermal conductance is enhanced when a zigzag-oriented strain is applied but
decreases when an armchair-oriented strain is applied; whereas the
armchair-oriented thermal conductance always decreases when either a zigzag- or
an armchair-oriented strain is applied. The present work suggests that the
remarkable thermal transport anisotropy and its strain-modulated effect in
single-layer phosphorene may be used for thermal management in
phosphorene-based electronics and optoelectronic devices.

with <10% of cluster stars retaining their discs for longer than 2-6 Myr. Given
that at least half of all stars in the field seem to harbor one or more

growth. Here we question the validity of this constraint by demonstrating that
the short disc dissipation times inferred to date might have been heavily
underestimated by selection effects. Critically, for ages >3Myr only stars that
originally populated the densest areas of very populous clusters, which are
prone to disc erosion, are actually considered. This tiny sample may not be

class of models, the reaction-diffusion models, is built around the idea that
hydrogen is released from the interface and that it is the diffusion of some
form of hydrogen that controls both degradation and recovery. While many
different variants of the reaction-diffusion idea have been published over the
years, the most commonly used recent models are based on non-dispersive
reaction rates and non- dispersive diffusion. The other class of models is
based on the idea that degradation is controlled by first-order reactions with
widely distributed (dispersive) reaction rates. We demonstrate that these two
classes give fundamentally different predictions for the stochastic degradation
and recovery of nanoscale devices, therefore providing the ultimate modeling
benchmark. Using de- tailed experimental time-dependent defect spectroscopy
(TDDS) data obtained on such nanoscale devices, we investigate the
compatibility of these models with experiment. Our results show that the
diffusion of hydrogen (or any other species) is unlikely to be the limiting
aspect that determines degradation. On the other hand, the data are fully
consistent with reaction-limited models. We finally argue that only the correct
understanding of the physical mechanisms leading to the significant
device-to-device variation observed in the degradation in nanoscale devices
will enable accurate reliability projections and device optimization.

We find that the Kondo physics is significantly modified by the presence of the
Majorana modes. When the Majorana modes are coupled, aside from the Kondo scale
$T_K$, a new energy scale $T^*\ll T_K$ emerges, that controls the low energy
physics of the system. At low temperatures, the ac-conductance is suppressed
for frequencies below $T^*$, while the noise spectrum acquires a $\sim
\omega^3$ dependence. At high temperatures, $T \gg T_K$, the regular
logarithmic dependence in the differential conductance is also affected. Under
non-equilibrium conditions, and in particular in the $\{T, B\}\to 0$ limit, the
differential conductance becomes negative. These findings indicate that the
changes in transport may serve as clues for detecting the Majorana bound states

QCD phase diagram is under debate. While it is possible to predict its position
by using effective models specifically built to reproduce some of the features
of the underlying theory (QCD), the quality of the predictions (\textit{e.g.},
the CEP position) obtained by such effective models, depends on whether solving
the model equations constitute a well- or ill-posed inverse problem.
  Considering these predictions as being inverse problems provides tools to
evaluate if the problem is ill-conditioned, meaning that infinitesimal
variations of the inputs of the model can cause comparatively large variations
of the predictions. If it is ill-conditioned, it has major consequences because
of finite variations that could come from experimental and/or theoretical
errors.
  In the following, we shall apply such a reasoning on the predictions of a
particular Nambu--Jona-Lasinio model within the mean field + ring
approximations, with special attention to the prediction of the chiral CEP
position in the $(T-\mu)$ plane. We find that the problem is ill-conditioned
(\idest very sensitive to input variations) for the $T$-coordinate of the CEP,
whereas, it is well-posed for the $\mu$-coordinate of the CEP. As a
consequence, when the chiral condensate varies in a $10$ MeV range, $\mu_{CEP}$
varies far less.
  As an illustration to understand how problematic this could be, we show that
the main consequence when taking into account finite variation of the inputs,
is that the existence of the CEP itself cannot be predicted anymore: for a
deviation as low as 0.6 \% with respect to vacuum phenomenology (well within
the estimation of the first correction to the ring approximation) the CEP may
or may not exist.

An updated formal version is under review",,"10.1038/srep07892",,"physics.optics","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We present an effective medium theory that can predict the effective
permittivity and permeability of a geometrically anisotropic two-dimensional
metamaterial composed with a rectangular array of elliptical cylinders. It is
possible to obtain a closed-form analytical solution for the anisotropic
effective medium parameters if the aspect ratio of the lattice and the
eccentricity of elliptical cylinder satisfy certain conditions. The derived
effective medium theory can recover the well-known Maxwell-Garnett results in
the quasi-static regime. More importantly, it is valid beyond the
long-wavelength limit, where the wavelength in the host medium is comparable to
the size of the lattice so that previous anisotropic effective medium theories
fail. The validity of the derived effective medium theory is verified by band
structure calculations. A real sample of a recent theoretically proposed
anisotropic medium with near-zero index to control flux is achieved from the
derived effective medium theory and control of electromagnetic waves in the
sample is clearly demonstrated. The accuracy of the theory is further
systematically studied as material and geometric parameter varies, and we find
the derived effective medium theory applies over a large range in the parameter
space. Such applicability greatly broadens the applicable realm of the
effective medium theory and opens many vistas in the design of structures with
desired anisotropic material characteristics.

Furthermore, the authors propose a new random pattern generator which copes

correlation in reduced density-matrix functional theory (RDMFT) and of

focuses on the calculation of total energies, occupation numbers,
removal/addition energies, and spectral functions. We use the exactly solvable
Hubbard molecule at 1/4 and 1/2 filling as test systems. This allows us to
analyze the underlying physics and to elucidate the origin of the observed
trends. For comparison we also report the results of the $GW$ approximation,
where the self-energy functional is approximated, but no further hypothesis are
made concerning the approximations of the observables. In particular we focus
on the atomic limit, where the two sites of the molecule are pulled apart and
electrons localize on either site with equal probability, unless a small
perturbation is present: this is the regime of strong electron correlation. In
this limit, using the Hubbard molecule at 1/2 filling with or without a
spin-symmetry-broken ground state, allows us to explore how degeneracies and
spin-symmetry breaking are treated in RDMFT. We find that, within the used
approximations, neither in RDMFT nor in $GW$ the signature of strong
correlation are present in the spin-singlet ground state, whereas both give the
exact result for the spin-symmetry broken case. Moreover we show how the
spectroscopic properties change from one spin structure to the other. Our
findings can be generalized to other situations, which allows us to make
connections to real materials and experiment.

points in point processes on the line has been proposed recently. The
underlying statistical test investigates the null hypothesis of constant rate.
For that purpose, multiple filtered derivative processes are observed
simultaneously. Under the null hypothesis, each process $G$ asymptotically
takes the form \begin{align*} G \sim L, \end{align*} while $L$ is a zero-mean
Gaussian process with unit variance. This result is used to derive a rejection
threshold for statistical hypothesis testing.
  The purpose of this paper is to describe the behavior of $G$ under the
alternative hypothesis of rate changes and potential simultaneous variance
changes. We derive the approximation \begin{align*} G \sim \Delta
\cdot\left(\Lambda + L\right), \end{align*} with deterministic functions
$\Delta$ and $\Lambda$. The function $\Lambda$ accounts for the systematic
deviation of $G$ in the neighborhood of a change point. When only the rate
changes, $\Lambda$ is hat shaped. When also the variance changes, $\Lambda$
takes the form of a shark's fin. In addition, the parameter estimates required
in practical application are not consistent in the neighborhood of a change
point. Therefore, we derive the factor $\Delta$ termed here the distortion
function. It accounts for the lack in consistency and describes the local
parameter estimating process relative to the true scaling of the filtered
derivative process.

calling for more investigation on their formation. The first proposed model for
the formation of such strong magnetic fields in magnetars was through
alpha-dynamo effects on the rapidly rotating core of a massive star. Other
scenarios involve highly magnetic massive progenitors that conserve their
strong magnetic moment into the core after the explosion, or a common envelope
phase of a massive binary system. In this work, we do a complete re-analysis of
the archival X-ray emission of the Supernova Remnants (SNR) surrounding
magnetars, and compare our results with all other bright X-ray emitting SNRs,
which are associated with Compact Central Objects (CCOs; which are proposed to
have magnetar-like B-fields buried in the crust by strong accretion soon after
their formation), high-B pulsars and normal pulsars. We find that emission
lines in SNRs hosting highly magnetic neutron stars do not differ significantly
in elements or ionization state from those observed in other SNRs, neither
averaging on the whole remnants, nor studying different parts of their total
spatial extent. Furthermore, we find no significant evidence that the total
X-ray luminosities of SNRs hosting magnetars, are on average larger than that
of typical young X-ray SNRs. Although biased by a small number of objects, we
found that for a similar age, there is the same percentage of magnetars showing

On the one hand we are interested in
addressing whether a sample of ETGs morphologically selected differs from a
sample of passive galaxies in terms of galaxy statistics. On the other hand we
study how the relative abundance of galaxies, the number density and the
stellar mass density for different morphological types change over the redshift
range 0.6<z<2.5. From the 1302 galaxies brighter than Ks=22 selected from the
GOODS-MUSIC catalogue, we classified the ETGs on the basis of their morphology
and the passive galaxies on the basis of their sSFR. We proved how the
definition of passive galaxy depends on the IMF adopted in the models and on
the assumed sSFR threshold. We find that ETGs cannot be distinguished from the
other morphological classes on the basis of their low sSFR, irrespective of the
IMF adopted in the models. Using the sample of 1302 galaxies morphologically
classified into spheroidal galaxies (ETGs) and not spheroidal galaxies (LTGs),
we find that their fractions are constant over the redshift range 0.6<z<2.5
(20-30% ETGs vs 70-80% LTGs). However, at z<1 these fractions change among the
population of the most massive (M*>=10^(11) M_sol) galaxies, with the fraction
of massive ETGs rising up to 40% and the fraction of massive LTGs decreasing
down to 60%. Moreover, we find that the number density and the stellar mass
density of the whole population of massive galaxies increase almost by a factor
of ~10 between 0.6<z<2.5, with a faster increase of these densities for the
ETGs than for the LTGs. Finally, we find that the number density of the
highest-mass galaxies (M*>3-4x10^(11) M_sol) both ETGs and LTGs do not increase
since z~2.5, contrary to the lower mass galaxies. This suggests that the
population of the most massive galaxies formed at z>2.5-3 and that the assembly
of such high-mass galaxies is not effective at lower redshift.

from the two different indices by means of the comparison with stellar
population synthesis models, are not consistent with each other for at least
nine galaxies (60 per cent of the sample), while for the remaining six
galaxies, the ages derived from their global spectral energy distribution (SED)
fitting are not consistent with those derived from the two indices. We then
hypothesized that the stellar content of many galaxies is made of two stellar
components with different ages. The double-component analysis, performed by
taking into account both the index values and the observed SED, fully explains
the observational data and improves the results of the standard one-component
SED fitting in 9 out of the 15 objects, i.e. those for which the two indices
point towards two different ages. In all of them, the bulk of the mass belongs
to rather evolved stars, while a small mass fraction is many Gyr younger. In
some cases, thanks to the sensitivity of the H+K(CaII) index, we find that the
minor younger component reveals signs of recent star formation. The
distribution of the ages of the younger stellar components appears uniformly in
time and this suggests that small amounts of star formation could be common
during the evolution of high-z ETGs. We argue the possibility that these new
star formation episodes could be frequently triggered by internal causes due to
the presence of small gas reservoir.

propagation of the nascent fast solar wind. Applying Gaussian fitting
procedures to the observed line profiles, Doppler velocity, intensity, line
width (FWHM) and electron density have been estimated over CH and adjacent QS
region of a North Polar Coronal Hole (NPCH). The aim of this study is to
identify the coronal funnels based on spectral signatures. Excess width regions
(excess FWHM above a threshold level) have been identified in QS and CH. The
plasma flow inversion (average red-shifts changing to blue-shifts at a specific
height) in CH and excess width regions of QS take place at ~
5.01$\times$10$^{5}$ K. Furthermore, high density concentration in excess width
regions of QS provides an indication that these regions are the footprints of
coronal funnels. We have also found that non-thermal velocities of CH are
higher in comparison to QS confirming that the CHs are the source regions of
fast solar wind. Doppler and non-thermal velocities as recorded by different
temperature lines have been also compared with previously published results. As
we go from lower to upper solar atmosphere, down-flows are dominated in lower
atmosphere while coronal lines are dominated by up-flows with a maximum value
of ~ 10-12 km s$^{-1}$ in QS. Non-thermal velocity increases first but after

element method, taking particle contact and hydrodynamic lubrication into
account. The resulting flow regimes are mapped in the parametric space of solid
volume fraction, shear rate, fluid viscosity and particle stiffness. Below a
critical volume fraction $\phi_c$, the rheology is governed by the Stokes
number, which distinguishes between viscous and inertial flow regimes. Above
$\phi_c$, a quasistatic regime exists for low and moderate shear rates. At very
high shear rates, the $\phi$ dependence is lost and soft particle rheology is
explored. The transitions between rheological regimes are associated with the
evolving contribution of lubrication to the suspension stress. Transitions in
microscopic phenomena such as inter-particle force distribution, fabric and
correlation length are found to correspond to those in the macroscopic flow.
Motivated by the bulk rheology, a constitutive model is proposed combining a
viscous pressure term with a dry granular model presented by Chialvo, Sun and
Sundaresan [Phys. Rev. E. \textbf{85}, 021305 (2012)]. The model is shown to
successfully capture the flow regime transitions.

The yielding rapidity logarithms from infrared enhancement need to be resummed
for both hadronic wave functions and short-distance functions, to achieve
scheme-independent calculations of physical quantities. We briefly review the
recent progress on the rapidity resummation for $B$-meson wave functions which
are the key ingredients of TMD factorization formulae for radiative-leptonic,
semi-leptonic and non-leptonic $B$-meson decays. The crucial observation is
that rapidity resummation induces a strong suppression of $B$-meson wave
functions at small light-quark momentum, strengthening the applicability of TMD
factorization in exclusive $B$-meson decays. The phenomenological consequence
of rapidity-resummation improved $B$-meson wave functions is further discussed

FIGGS survey to study the correlation between the atomic gas density
(Sigma_gas,atomic) and star formation rate (Sigma_SFR) in the galaxies. The
estimated gas phase metallicity of our sample galaxies is Z ~ 0.1 Z_sun.
Understanding star formation in such molecule poor gas is of particular
importance since it is likely to be of direct relevance to simulations of early
galaxy formation. For about 20% (9/43) of our sample galaxies, we find that the
HI distribution is significantly disturbed, with little correspondence between
the optical and HI distributions. We exclude these galaxies from the
comparison. We also exclude galaxies with very low star formation rates, for
which stochastic effects make it difficult to estimate the true star formation
rates. For the remaining galaxies we compute the Sigma_gas,atomic and Sigma_SFR
averaged over the entire star forming disk of the galaxy. For these galaxies we
find a nearly linear relation between the star formation rate and the atomic
gas surface densities. The corresponding gas consumption timescale is ~ 10 Gyr,
i.e. significantly smaller than the ~ 100 Gyr estimated for the outer regions
of spiral galaxies. We also estimate the gas consumption timescale computed
using the global gas content and the global star formation rate for all
galaxies with a reliable measurement of the star formation rate, regardless of
whether the HI distribution is disturbed or not. The mean gas consumption
timescale computed using this entire gas reservoir is ~ 18 Gyr, i.e. still
significantly smaller than that estimated for the outer parts of spirals. The
gas consumption timescale for dwarfs is intermediate between the values of ~
100 Gyr and ~ 2 Gyr estimated for the outer molecule poor and inner molecule
rich regions of spiral disks.

theory, this problem can be solved by the natural convex joint/mixed
relaxations (i.e., l_{1}-norm and trace norm) under certain conditions.
However, all current provable algorithms suffer from superlinear per-iteration
cost, which severely limits their applicability to large-scale problems. In
this paper, we propose a scalable, provable structured low-rank matrix
factorization method to recover low-rank and sparse matrices from missing and
grossly corrupted data, i.e., robust matrix completion (RMC) problems, or
incomplete and grossly corrupted measurements, i.e., compressive principal
component pursuit (CPCP) problems. Specifically, we first present two
small-scale matrix trace norm regularized bilinear structured factorization
models for RMC and CPCP problems, in which repetitively calculating SVD of a
large-scale matrix is replaced by updating two much smaller factor matrices.
Then, we apply the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) to
efficiently solve the RMC problems. Finally, we provide the convergence
analysis of our algorithm, and extend it to address general CPCP problems.
Experimental results verified both the efficiency and effectiveness of our

representation of these metasurfaces, we establish that an arbitrary source
field can be converted into directive radiation via a passive lossless HMS if
two physical conditions are met: local power conservation and local impedance
equalization. Expressing the fields via their plane-wave spectrum and
harnessing the slowly-varying envelope approximation we obtain semi-analytical

that the local impedance equalization induces a Fresnel-like reflection, while
local power conservation forms a radiating virtual aperture which follows the
total excitation field magnitude. The semi-analytical predictions are verified
by finite-element simulations of HMSs designed for different source

appearance of a non-physical extraneous vectorial electrostatic law. Therefore,
the strain gradient flexoelectricity must be classified as an inconsistent

electromechanical coupling in dielectrics. Some new aspects of this theory are
presented for isotropic and centrosymmetric cubic dielectric materials, whose

in describing low-energy heavy ion collisions. Recently, we have shown that
multinucleon transfer processes can be reasonably described in the TDHF theory
combined with the particle-number projection technique. Purpose: In this work,
we propose a theoretical framework to analyze properties of reaction products
in TDHF calculations. Methods: TDHF calculation in three-dimensional Cartesian
grid representation combined with particle number projection method. Results:
We develop a theoretical framework to calculate expectation values of operators
in the TDHF wave function after collision with the particle-number projection.
To show how our method works in practice, the method is applied to
$^{24}$O+$^{16}$O collisions for two quantities, angular momentum and
excitation energy. The analyses revealed following features of the reaction:
The nucleon removal proceeds gently, leaving small values of angular momentum
and excitation energy in nucleon removed nuclei. Contrarily, nuclei receiving
nucleons show expectation values of angular momentum and excitation energy
which increase as the incident energy increases. Conclusions: We have developed
a formalism to analyze properties of fragment nuclei in the TDHF theory
combined with the particle-number projection technique. The method will be
useful for microscopic investigations of reaction mechanisms in low-energy
heavy ion collisions as well as for evaluating effects of particle evaporation
on multinucleon transfer cross sections.

enhance the room-temperature electron mobility in single-layer MoS$_{2}$ (SLM)

this mobility enhancement is due to the non-degeneracy of the two-dimensional
electron gas system in SLM at accessible temperatures. Using our charged
impurity scattering model [Ong and Fischetti, Phys. Rev. B 86, 121409 (2012)]
and temperature-dependent polarizability, we calculate the charged
impurity-limited mobility ($\mu_{\textrm{imp}}$) in SLM with and without a
high-$\kappa$ (HfO$_{2}$) top gate oxide at different electron densities and
temperatures. We find that the mobility enhancement is larger at low electron
densities and high temperatures because of finite-temperature screening, thus
explaining the enhancement of the mobility observed at room temperature.
$\mu_{\textrm{imp}}$ is shown to decrease significantly with increasing
temperature, suggesting that the strong temperature dependence of measured
mobilities should not be interpreted as being solely due to inelastic
scattering with phonons. We also reproduce the recently seen experimental trend
in which the temperature scaling exponent ($\gamma$) of
$\mu_{\textrm{imp}}\propto T^{-\gamma}$ is smaller in top-gated SLM than in
bare SLM. Finally, we show that a $\sim37$ percent mobility enhancement can be
achieved by reducing the HfO$_{2}$ thickness from 20 to 2 nm.

projective determinantal quantum Monte Carlo simulations, we examine the
Hubbard model on the square lattice bilayer at half filling. From this combined
analysis, we obtain a comprehensive account on the ground state phase diagram
with respect to the extent of the system's metallic and (antiferromagnetically
ordered) Mott-insulating as well as band-insulating regions. By means of an
unbiased functional renormalization group approach, we exhibit the
antiferromagnetic Mott-insulating state as the relevant instability of the free
metallic state, induced by any weak finite onsite repulsion. Upon performing a
careful analysis of the quantum Monte Carlo data, we resolve the difficulty of
identifying this antiferromagnetic ground state for finite interlayer hopping
in the weak-coupling regime, where nonmonotonous finite-size corrections are
shown to relate to the two-sheeted Fermi surface structure of the metallic
phase. On the other hand, quantum Monte Carlo simulations are well suited to
identify the transition between the Mott-insulating phase and the band
insulator in the intermediate-to-strong coupling regime. Here, we compare our
numerical findings to indications for the transition region obtained from the
functional renormalization group procedure.

smaller than the Chandrasekhar limit may undergo nuclear runaway and SNa
explosion, triggered by the energy produced by under-barrier pycno-nuclear
reactions between carbon and light elements. Such reactions would be due to
left over impurities of the light elements, which would remain inactive until
the WDs transit from the liquid to the solid state. We devise a simple
formulation for the coulombian potential and the local density in a ionic
lattice affected by impurities and introduce it in the known rates of
pycno-nuclear reactions for multi-component plasmas. Our semi-analytical
results indicate that the energy generated by these pycno-nuclear reactions
exceeds the WD luminosity and provides enough energy to elementary cells of
matter to balance the energy cost for C-ignition at much younger ages than the
age of the Universe, even for WDs with masses as low as $\simeq 0.85\,
M_\odot$. A thermonuclear runaway may thus be triggered in isolated WDs. The
explosion would occur from few hundred thousand to a few million years after
the WD formation in the mass interval $0.85 - 1.2\, M_\odot$.

reached the galactic level at 121.7 AU, 4 episodes of rapid intensity change
occured similar to the Forbush Decreases found near the sun, rather than the
expected result of models related to those describing Long Term Modulation in
the inner solar system. Because the mean solar wind flow is both expected and
observed to be perpendicular to the radial direction close to the heliopause,
explanation is given in terms of transient radial flows related to possible
heliopause boundary flapping. It is necessary that radial flows are at the
sound speed found for conditions downstream of the teminal shock and that the
relevant perpendicular cosmic ray diffusion is controlled by 'slab' field
fluctuations accounting for 20 percent or less of the total power in field
variance. However, additional radial drift motion related to possible north to
south gradients in the magnetic field may allow the inclusion of some diffusion
according to 2-D turbulence theory. The required field gradients may arise due
to variation in the field carried by the solar plasma deflected away from the
solar equatorial plane. Modulation amounting to a total 30 percent drop in
galactic intensity requires explanation by a combination of several transient

  Starting from the zero-age main sequence binary stage, we aim at inferring
the birth masses of PSR J1614-2230 and PSR J0751+1807 by taking the differences
in the evolutionary stages preceding their formation into account.
  Using simulations for the evolution of binary stars, we reconstruct the
evolutionary tracks leading to the formation of PSR J1614-2230 and PSR
J0751+1807. We analyze in detail the spin evolution due to the accretion of
matter from a disk in the intermediate-mass/low-mass X-ray binary. We consider
two equations of state of dense matter, one for purely nucleonic matter and the
other one including a high-density softening due to the appearance of hyperons.
Stationary and axisymmetric stellar configurations in general relativity are
used, together with a recent magnetic torque model and
observationally-motivated laws for the decay of magnetic field.
  The estimated birth mass of the neutron stars PSR J0751+1807 and PSR
J1614-2230 could be as low as 1.0 Msun and as high as 1.9 Msun, respectively.
These values depend weakly on the equation of state and the assumed model for
the magnetic field and its accretion-induced decay.
  The masses of progenitor neutron stars of recycled pulsars span a broad
interval from 1.0 Msun to 1.9 Msun. Including the effect of a slow Roche-lobe
detachment phase, which could be relevant for PSR J0751+1807, would make the
lower mass limit even lower. A realistic theory for core-collapse supernovae

$N$-body solutions, in terms of the one-point, two-point, and three-point
statistics. In particular, the agreement is remarkable, within $1\%$ up to
$k=0.55$ $h$Mpc$^{-1}$ and down to $r=10$ $h^{-1}$Mpc, for the power spectrum
and two-point correlation function respectively, while the bispectrum agrees in
general within $20\%$ for different scales and shapes. Our approach is based on
the Zel'dovich approximation, however, effectively including with the simple
prescriptions the missing physical ingredients, and stochastic scale-dependent,
non-local and nonlinear biasing contributions. The computing time and memory
required to produce one mock is similar to that using the log-normal model.
With high accuracy and efficiency, the effective Zel'dovich approximation mocks
(EZmocks) provide a reliable and practical method to produce massive mock
galaxy catalogues for the analysis of large-scale structure measurements.

one the most complete existing catalogues of galaxy clusters based on SDSS data
and following two methods: the first one compares the colours of samples of
galaxies in the background of clusters with those of galaxies in the field.
Using this method, we have explored clustercentric distances up to 6 Mpc. The
galaxies used in this first method were selected from the SDSS-DR9, among those
having reliable photometry and accurate estimation of photometric redshifts.
The results are largely independent of the galactic cut applied. At |b|>20
deg., the sample contains 56,985 clusters in the redshift range 0.05<z<0.68
(the mean redshift is 0.30) and ~5.3x10^6 galaxies. The second method computes
the contribution of dust in clusters of galaxies to the far infrared sky. That
is estimated indirectly by measuring the effect of clusters in the E(B-V)
extinction map.
  Using the first method, we did not find any dependence with clustercentric
distance in the colours of background galaxies. This allows us to constrain the
mass of dust in the intracluster media, M_dust<8.4x10^9 M_sun (95% C.L.) within
a cluster radius of 3 Mpc. With the second method, which averages the
extinction of all clusters, we find a surface integral of the excess of colour
g-i of 3.4+/-0.1 millimag Mpc^2. This is equivalent to ~60 times the far
infrared luminosity of a Milky Way-like galaxy. By assumming similar properties
for the dust, we can estimate a total dust mass per cluster of ~2x10^9 M_sun,
which is compatible with the hypothesis that the dust is within the spiral
galaxies of a cluster. Separating the clusters in 5x5 bins in redshift and
richness, we confirm previous findings of a clear increase in luminosity with a
redshift that agrees with the trend expected from current models.

correlation between the local surface density of YSOs and column density of
molecular gas as traced by dust extinction that is roughly described as a power
law in these quantities. NGC 2264 follows a power law index of ~2.7, exhibiting
a large YSO surface density for a given gas column density. Outside of NGC 2264
where the surface density of YSOs is lower, the power law is shallower and the
region exhibits a larger gas column density for a YSO surface density,
suggesting the star formation is more recent. In order to measure the fraction
of cloud members with circumstellar disks/envelopes, we estimate the number of
diskless pre-main sequence stars by statistical removal of background star
detections. We find that the disk fraction of the NGC 2264 region is 45%, while
the surrounding more distributed regions show a disk fraction of 19%. This may
be explained by the presence an older, more dispersed population of stars. In

Leggett-Garg inequality (LGI) constituting a necessary condition for
macrorealism. The robustness of its quantum mechanical (QM) violation against
unsharpness of measurement is investigated by using a suitable model of unsharp
measurements. It is found that there exists a range of values of the sharpness
parameter (characterizing precision of the relevant measurements) for which the
usual LGI is satisfied by QM, but Wigner's form of the LGI (WLGI) is violated.
This implies that for such unsharp measurements, the QM violation of
macrorealism cannot be tested using the usual LGI, but can be tested using
WLGI. In showing this, we take into account the general form of the usual LGI
involving an arbitrary number of pairs of two-time correlation functions.
Another recently proposed necessary condition for macrorealism, called
`no-signalling in time', is also probed, showing that its QM violation persists
for arbitrarily unsharp measurements.

type of edges (ACGNFs and ZZGNFs), size and the number of electrons. We observe
that, due to the edge-induced strain effect in ACGNFs, large-scale ACGNFs'
cohesive energy decreases as their size increases. This trend does not hold for
ZZGNFs due to the presence of many edge states in ZZGNFs. We find that the
energy gaps $E_g$ of GNFs all decay with respect to $1/L$, where $L$ is the
size of the GNF, in a linear fashion. But as their size increases, ZZGNFs
exhibit more localized edge states. We believe the presence of these states
makes their gap decrease more rapidly. In particular, when $L$ is larger than
6.40 $nm$, we find that ZZGNFs exhibit metallic characteristics. Furthermore,
we find that the aromatic structures of GNFs appear to depend only on whether

We show that also the velocity of sound, like the (effective) equation of state

radial dependent change proportional to $\beta$. In order to produce a

must take $\beta < 0$. The redshift gets a modified dependence on the scale

away from the center of symmetry they become negative -- a property usually
encountered for the dark energy component only. In order to mimic the observed
late-time accelerated expansion, the matter component must significantly depart

filtration rate (eGFR). However, eGFR values are recorded without reference to
the creatinine (SCr) assays used to derive them, and newer assays were
introduced at different time points across laboratories in UK. These changes
may cause systematic bias in eGFR reported in routinely collected data; even
though laboratory reported eGFR values have a correction factor applied.
  Design: An algorithm to detect changes in SCr which affect eGFR calculation
method by comparing the mapping of SCr values on to eGFR values across a
time-series of paired eGFR and SCr measurements.
  Setting: Routinely collected primary care data from 20,000 people with the
richest renal function data from the Quality Improvement in Chronic Kidney
Disease (QICKD) trial.
  Results: The algorithm identified a change in eGFR calculation method in 80
(63%) of the 127 included practices. This change was identified in 4,736
(23.7%) patient time series analysed. This change in calibration method was
found to cause a significant step change in reported eGFR values producing a
systematic bias. eGFR values could not be recalibrated by applying the
Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) equation to the laboratory
reported SCr values.
  Conclusions: This algorithm can identify laboratory changes in eGFR
calculation methods and changes in SCr assay. Failure to account for these
changes may misconstrue renal function changes over time. Researchers using

high mobility communications. The main bottleneck of this communication network
is handover, since the handover occurs so frequently and the delays are so long

have been developed and studied recently. However, no comprehensive evaluation
method for these models is employed. To this end, we borrow Data Envelopment
Analysis (DEA) method to evaluate six typical handover system models. Handover
models that to be evaluated are introduced. A brief presentation of DEA and its
characters is provided. A specific procedure of the evaluation is proposed.
Then the results of the evaluation are obtained by running the DEA. Finally, we
give our comments and conclusions to all the handover models. We hope our work
will supply a gap in the system evaluation area.

method we approximate the investigated equation along with a constant flux
boundary conditions and obtain a very accurate solution. Moreover, we
generalize the approximation method and provide explicit formulas which can be

simple approximate solution of the time-fractional porous medium equation fits
accurately a sample data which comes from one of these experiments.

network due to the interaction of its complex network components with the
nitric oxide molecule. In single cell process, increase in nitric oxide
concentration gives rise the transition to various p53 temporal behaviours,
namely fixed point oscillation, damped oscillation and sustain oscillation
indicating stability, weakly activated and strongly activated states. The noise
in stochastic system is found to help to reach these states much faster as
compared to deterministic case which is evident from permutation entropy
dynamics. In coupled system with nitric oxide as diffusively coupling molecule,
we found nitric oxide as strong coupling molecule within a certain range of
coupling strength \epsilon beyond which it become weak synchronizing agent. We
study these effects by using correlation like synchronization indicator \gamma
obtained from permutation entropies of the coupled system, and found five
important regimes in (\epsilon-\gamma) phase diagram, indicating
desynchronized, transition, strongly synchronized, moderately synchronized and
weakly synchronized regimes respectively. We claim that there is the
competition between the toxicity and the synchronizing role of nitric oxide
that lead the cell in different stressed conditions.

can occur anytime a prescribed medication is ingested. There has been a recent
interest in using the vast quantities of medical data available in longitudinal
observational databases to identify causal relationships between drugs and
medical events. Unfortunately the majority of existing post marketing
surveillance algorithms measure how dependant or associated an event is on the
presence of a drug rather than measuring causality. In this paper we
investigate potential attributes that can be used in causal inference to
identify side effects based on the Bradford-Hill causality criteria. Potential
attributes are developed by considering five of the causality criteria and
feature selection is applied to identify the most suitable of these attributes
for detecting side effects. We found that attributes based on the specificity
criterion may improve side effect signalling algorithms but the experiment and
dosage criteria attributes investigated in this paper did not offer sufficient
additional information.

and dynamics of natural systems and phenomena. The dimensionality effects of
the blackbody radiation has been the subject of considerable research activity
in recent years. These studies are still somewhat fragmentary, pos- ing
formidable qualitative and quantitative problems for various scientific and
technological areas. In this work we carry out an information-theoretical
analysis of the spectral energy density of a d-dimensional blackbody at
temperature T by means of various entropy-like quantities (disequilibrium,
Shannon entropy, Fisher information) as well as by three (dimensionless)
complexity measures (Cr\'amer-Rao, Fisher-Shannon and LMC). All these
frequency-functional quantities are calculated and discussed in terms of
temperature and dimensionality. It is shown that all three measures of
complexity have an universal character in the sense that they depend neither on
temperature nor on the Planck and Boltzmann constants, but only on the the
space dimensionality d. Moreover, they decrease when d is increasing; in
particular, the values 2.28415, 1.90979 and 1.17685 are found for the
Cr\'amer-Rao, Fisher-Shannon and LMC measures of complexity of the
3-dimensional blackbody radiation, respectively. In addition, beyond the
frequency at which the spectral density is maximum (which follows the
well-known Wien displacement law), three further characteristic frequencies are
defined in terms of the previous entropy quantities; they are shown to obey
Wien-like laws. The potential usefulness of these distinctive features of the
blackbody spectrum is physically discussed.
