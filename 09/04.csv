as potentially useful tools for solving problems in verification and database
theory. One popular model of automata studied is the Class Memory Automata
(CMA), for which the emptiness problem is equivalent to Petri Net Reachability.
We identify a restriction - which we call weakness - of CMA, and show that
their emptiness problem is equivalent to Petri Net Coverability. Further, we
show that in the deterministic case they are closed under all Boolean
operations. We clarify the connections between weak CMA and existing automata
over data languages. We also extend CMA to operate over multiple levels of
nested data values, and show that while these have undecidable emptiness in
general, adding the weakness constraint recovers decidability of emptiness, via
reduction to coverability in well-structured transition systems. We also
examine connections with existing automata over nested data.

geometries, starting from the origins of Euclidean geometry a few centuries BC

and the Riemannian geometric approach started to be developed. Moreover, the
discovery of non-Euclidean geometry, about 40 years earlier, had just been
demonstrated to be a ""true"" geometry on the same footing as Euclidean geometry.
These were radically new ideas, but henceforth the importance of the topic
became gradually realized. As a consequence, the conventional attitude to the
basic geometric questions, including the possible geometric structure of the
physical space, was challenged, and foundational problems became an important
issue during the following decades. Such a basic understanding of the status of
geometry around 1870 enables one to study the geometric works of Sophus Lie and
Felix Klein at the beginning of their career in the appropriate historical
perspective.

both the selection of the samples and in the luminosity ratio constrain, and
(iii) splitting individual PDFs into red and blue spectral templates to deal
robustly with colour selections. We test the performance of our new methodology
with the PDFs provided by the ALHAMBRA photometric survey. The merger fractions
and rates from the ALHAMBRA survey are in excellent agreement with those from
spectroscopic work, both for the general population and for red and blue
galaxies. With the merger rate of bright (M_B <= -20 - 1.1z) galaxies evolving
as (1+z)^n, the power-law index n is larger for blue galaxies (n = 2.7 +- 0.5)
than for red galaxies (n = 1.3 +- 0.4), confirming previous results.
Integrating the merger rate over cosmic time, we find that the average number
of mergers per galaxy since z = 1 is N_m = 0.57 +- 0.05 for red galaxies and
N_m = 0.26 +- 0.02 for blue galaxies. Our new methodology exploits
statistically all the available information provided by photometric redshift
codes and provides accurate measurements of the merger fraction by close pairs
only using photometric redshifts. Current and future photometric surveys will
benefit of this new methodology.

of the velocity field. To assess the quality of these POD reconstructions, we
define simple measures which are believed to be relevant for a sequential

yields a (continuous or discrete) Cole-Hopf transformation, or leaves us with
the problem of solving Riemann equations (hence an application of the hodograph

system of `Riemann equations' are also solutions of an equation that arises, on
the universal level of bidifferential calculus, as an integrability condition.
Depending on the choice of bidifferential calculus, the latter can represent a

matrix versions of the two-dimensional Toda lattice, Hirota's bilinear

Poisson random inclusions). We also report on a systematic numerical study in

layers are aggregated in clusters. We sorted the size of the clusters from a
power law distribution tuning the exponent a of the distribution function. The
sorted high refractive layer clusters are randomly distributed within the low
refractive index layers. We studied the total light transmission, within the
photonic band gap of the corresponding periodic crystal, as a function of the
exponent in the distribution. We observed that, for a within the interval
[0,3.5], the trend can be fitted with a sigmoidal function.

  systems",,,,,"math.PR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In the nonlinear diffusion framework, stochastic processes of McKean-Vlasov
type play an important role. In some cases they correspond to processes
attracted by their own probability distribution: the so-called self-stabilizing
processes. Such diffusions can be obtained by taking the hydrodymamic limit in
a huge system of linear diffusions in interaction. In both cases, for the
linear and the nonlinear processes, small-noise asymptotics have been
emphasized by specific large deviation phenomenons. The natural question,
therefore, is: is it possible to interchange the mean-field limit with the
small-noise limit? The aim here is to consider this question by proving that
the rate function of the first particle in a mean-field system converges to the
rate function of the hydrodynamic limit as the number of particles becomes

galaxies (SFGs) between z=0 and 3, from the IRAM-COLDGASS, PHIBSS1/2 and other
surveys, with gas masses derived from Herschel far-IR dust measurements in 512
galaxy stacks over the same stellar mass/redshift range. We constrain the
scaling relations of molecular gas depletion time scale (tdepl) and gas to
stellar mass ratio (Mmolgas/M*) of SFGs near the star formation main-sequence
with redshift, specific star formation rate (sSFR) and stellar mass (M*). The
CO- and dust-based scaling relations agree remarkably well. This suggests that
the CO-H2 mass conversion factor varies little within 0.6dex of the main
sequence (sSFR(ms,z,M*)), and less than 0.3dex throughout this redshift range.
This study builds on and strengthens the results of earlier work. We find that
tdepl scales as (1+z)^-0.3 *(sSFR/sSFR(ms,z,M*))^-0.5, with little dependence
on M*. The resulting steep redshift dependence of Mmolgas/M* ~(1+z)^3 mirrors
that of the sSFR and probably reflects the gas supply rate. The decreasing gas
fractions at high M* are driven by the flattening of the SFR-M* relation.
Throughout the redshift range probed a larger sSFR at constant M* is due to a
combination of an increasing gas fraction and a decreasing depletion time
scale. As a result galaxy integrated samples of the Mmolgas-SFR rate relation
exhibit a super-linear slope, which increases with the range of sSFR. With
these new relations it is now possible to determine Mmolgas with an accuracy of
0.1dex in relative terms, and 0.2dex including systematic uncertainties.

framework to build an effective field theory for the fractional quantum Hall
effect that respects all the spacetime symmetries such as non-relativistic
diffeomorphism invariance and anisotropic Weyl invariance as well as the gauge
symmetry. The key to this formalism is a set of correspondence relations that
maps all the field degrees of freedom in the Horava-Lifshitz gravity theory to
external background (source) fields among others in the effective action of the
quantum Hall effect, according to their symmetry transformation properties. We
originally derive the map as a holographic dictionary, but its form is
independent of the existence of holographic duality. This paves the way for the
application of Horava-Lifshitz holography on fractional quantum Hall effect.
Using the simplest holographic Chern-Simons model, we compute the low energy
effective action at leading orders and show that it captures universal
electromagnetic and geometric properties of quantum Hall states, including the
Wen-Zee shift, Hall viscosity, angular momentum density and their relations. We
identify the shift function in Horava-Lifshitz gravity theory as minus of
guiding center velocity and conjugate to guiding center momentum. This enables
us to distinguish guiding center angular momentum density from the internal
one, which is the sum of Landau orbit spin and intrinsic (topological) spin of
the composite particles. Our effective action shows that Hall viscosity is
minus half of the internal angular momentum density and proportional to Wen-Zee
shift, and Hall bulk viscosity is half of the guiding center angular momentum
density.

represent the initial conditions for the subsequent evolution of substructures

cosmological N-body simulation to trace satellite haloes, and identify the time
of infall. We find signficant trends in the distribution of orbital parameters
with both the host halo mass and the ratio of satellite-to-host halo masses.
For all host halo masses, satellites whose infall mass is a larger fraction of
the host halo mass have more eccentric, radially biased orbits. At fixed
satellite-to-host halo mass ratio, high mass haloes are biased towards
accreting satellites on slightly more radial orbits. To charactise the orbital
distributions fully requires fitting the correlated bivariate distribution of
two chosen orbital parameters (e.g. radial and tangential velocity or energy
and angular momentum). We provide simple fits to one choice of the bivariate
distributions, which when transformed faithfully, captures the behaviour of any
of the projected one-dimensional distributions.

${\cal G}\supset {\cal G}_1 \times {\cal G}_2$ by a scalar in a rank three or
two antisymmetric tensor representation leads to a number of distinct $modular$
ground states. For these broken symmetry phases, the ground state is periodic
in an integer divisor $p$ of $N$, where $N>0$ is the absolute value of the
nonzero $U(1)$ generator of the scalar component $\Phi$ that is a singlet under
the simple subgroups ${\cal G}_1$ and ${\cal G}_2$. Ground state expectations
of fractional powers $\Phi^{p/N}$ provide order parameters that distinguish the
different phases. For the case of period $p=1$, this reduces to the usual Higgs
mechanism, but for divisors $N\geq p>1$ of $N$ it leads to a modular ground
state with periodicity $p$, implementing a discrete Abelian symmetry group
$U(1)/Z_p$. This observation may allow new approaches to grand unification and
family unification.

  propagation velocity in high current superconductors","To be published in Physics Procedia (ICEC 25 conference special
  issue)",,,,"physics.acc-ph physics.ins-det","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The stability of high-current superconductors is challenging in the design of
superconducting magnets. When the stability requirements are fulfilled, the
protection against a quench must still be considered. A main factor in the
design of quench protection systems is the resistance growth rate in the magnet
following a quench. The usual method for determining the resistance growth in
impregnated coils is to calculate the longitudinal velocity with which the
normal zone propagates in the conductor along the coil windings.
  Here, we present a 2D numerical model for predicting the normal zone
propagation velocity in Al stabilized Rutherford NbTi cables with large cross
section. By solving two coupled differential equations under adiabatic
conditions, the model takes into account the thermal diffusion and the current
redistribution process following a quench. Both the temperature and magnetic
field dependencies of the superconductor and the metal cladding materials
properties are included. Unlike common normal zone propagation analyses, we
study the influence of the thickness of the cladding on the propagation
velocity for varying operating current and magnetic field.
  To assist in the comprehension of the numerical results, we also introduce an
analytical formula for the longitudinal normal zone propagation. The analysis
distinguishes between low-current and high-current regimes of normal zone
propagation, depending on the ratio between the characteristic times of thermal
and magnetic diffusion. We show that above a certain thickness, the cladding
acts as a heat sink with a limited contribution to the acceleration of the
propagation velocity with respect to the cladding geometry. Both numerical and
analytical results show good agreement with experimental data.

proofreading to the regions of a dataset that are most impactful to the
resulting circuit. We then introduce a novel workflow, which exploits
biological information such as synapses, and apply it to a large dataset in the

learn- ing and the first solution to solve it. The problem is defined on two
different data domains sharing the same input and output spaces, named as
source domain and target domain. The outputs are structured, and for the data
samples of the source domain, the corresponding outputs are available, while
for most data samples of the target domain, the corresponding outputs are
missing. The input distributions of the two domains are significantly
different. The problem is to learn a predictor for the target domain to predict
the structured outputs from the input. Due to the limited number of outputs
available for the samples form the target domain, it is difficult to directly
learn the predictor from the target domain, thus it is necessary to use the
output information available in source domain. We propose to learn the target
domain predictor by adapting a auxiliary predictor trained by using source
domain data to the target domain. The adaptation is implemented by adding a
delta function on the basis of the auxiliary predictor. An algorithm is
developed to learn the parameter of the delta function to minimize loss
functions associat- ed with the predicted outputs against the true outputs of
the data samples with available outputs of the target domain.

Demazure modules can be greatly simplified. Furthermore, we investigate the
notion of fusion products for twisted modules, first defined in \cite{FL99} for
untwisted modules, and use the simplified presentation to prove a fusion
product decomposition of twisted Demazure modules. As a consequence we prove
that twisted Demazure modules can be obtained by taking the associated graded
modules of (untwisted) Demazure modules for simply-laced affine algebras.
Furthermore we give a semi-infinite fusion product construction for the
irreducible representations of twisted affine algebras. Finally, we prove that

for many interesting transport phenomena in which particle currents are

are the spin Hall effect, the Edelstein effect, and their inverses. By similar
mechanisms it is also possible to partially convert an optically induced
electron-hole density wave to a spin density wave and viceversa. In this paper
we present a unified theoretical treatment of these effects based on quantum
kinetic equations that include not only the intrinsic spin-orbit coupling from
the band structure of the host material, but also the spin-orbit coupling due
to an external electric field and a random impurity potential. The
drift-diffusion equations we derive in the diffusive regime are applicable to a
broad variety of experimental situations, both homogeneous and non-homogeneous,
and include on equal footing ""skew scattering"" and ""side-jump"" from
electron-impurity collisions. As a demonstration of the strength and usefulness
of the theory we apply it to the study of several effects of current
experimental interest: the inverse Edelstein effect, the spin-current swapping
effect, and the partial conversion of an electron-hole density wave to a spin
density wave in a two-dimensional electron gas with Rashba and Dresselhaus
spin-orbit couplings, subject to an electric field.

RLAGN are significantly denser than those of radio-quiet galaxies, implying
that not more than 50% of massive galaxies in this epoch can host powerful

over-dense blob in the ICM. We find two regimes in which the over-dense blobs
can cool to thermally stable low temperatures. One for large $t_{{\rm {cool}}}
/ t_{\rm {ff}}$ ($t_{{\rm {cool}}}$ is the cooling time and $t_{{\rm {ff}}}$ is
the free fall time), where a large initial over-density is required for thermal
runaway to occur; this is the regime which was previously analyzed in detail.
We discover a second regime for $t_{\rm {cool}} / t_{\rm {ff}} \lesssim 1$ (in
agreement with Cartesian simulations of local thermal instability in an
external gravitational field), where runaway cooling happens for arbitrarily
small amplitudes. Numerical simulations have shown that cold gas condenses out
more easily in a spherical geometry. We extend the analysis to include
geometrical compression in weakly stratified atmospheres such as the ICM. With
a single parameter, analogous to the mixing length, we are able to reproduce
the results from numerical simulations; namely, small density perturbations
lead to the condensation of extended cold filaments only if $t_{{\rm {cool}}} /

to the tip of the resolved conifold, which is not the case for the more
commonly used deformed conifold. This allows us to exploit the effect of the

motivated by string theory with masses similar to that of the gravitino and

the non-thermal production of the lightest superpartner (LSP) tends to create
an unacceptably large relic density or too strong of an indirect detection

we investigate extensions of the MSSM containing new LSP candidates that can
alleviate this tension. We examine the viability of this scenario in models
with light Abelian and non-Abelian hidden sectors, and symmetric or asymmetric
dark matter. In these extensions it is possible, though somewhat challenging,
to avoid a moduli-induced LSP problem. In all but the asymmetric scenario, the
LSP can account for only a small fraction of the observed dark matter density.

skewed on all observed timescales, consistent with the log-normal distributions

spectral densities display their high frequency break. This suggests that the
noise-like flaring observed is rising more slowly than it is falling, and thus
not time-reversible. This observation is also consistent with the fluctuating
accretion disk model. Furthermore, we observe the same qualitative biphase
trends in all four objects, where the biphases display a distinct decrease at
frequencies below the high-frequency break in their respective power spectral
densities. This behaviour can also be observed in the time-skewness of all four

perturbations in redshift space corresponds to performing a change of
coordinates and the resulting expressions contain products of density
perturbations and velocity fields evaluated at the same location. These terms
are sensitive to non-perturbative short-distance physics and in order to
correctly treat them they need to be renormalized by adding suitable
counterterms. Therefore more counterterms are required in redshift space
expressions compared to their real space analogs. In particular in the
expression for the one-loop matter power spectrum there are two new
counterterms. Just as in real space, long wavelength displacements affect
correlation functions in redshift space and need to be resummed. We generalize
the real space formulas for IR resummation to this case: the final expressions
are conceptually similar but are more challenging to compute numerically due to
their reduced symmetry.

neutron-capture process ($s$-process) in the globular clusters M4 (NGC 6121)
and M22 (NGC 6656). Stars in M4 have homogeneous abundances of Fe and
neutron-capture elements, but the entire cluster is enhanced in $s$-process
elements (Sr, Y, Ba, Pb) relative to other clusters with a similar metallicity.
In M22, two stellar groups exhibit different abundances of Fe and $s$-process
elements. By subtracting the mean abundances of $s$-poor from $s$-rich stars,
we derive $s$-process residuals or empirical $s$-process distributions for M4
and M22. We find that the $s$-process distribution in M22 is more weighted
toward the heavy $s$-peak (Ba, La, Ce) and Pb than M4, which has been enriched
mostly with light $s$-peak elements (Sr, Y, Zr). We construct simple chemical
evolution models using yields from massive star models that include rotation,
which dramatically increases $s$-process production at low metallicity. We show
that our massive star models with rotation rates of up to 50\% of the critical
(break-up) velocity and changes to the preferred
$^{17}$O($\alpha$,$\gamma$)$^{21}$Ne rate produce insufficient heavy
$s$-elements and Pb to match the empirical distributions. For models that
incorporate AGB yields, we find that intermediate-mass yields (with a $^{22}$Ne
neutron source) alone do not reproduce the light-to-heavy $s$-element ratios
for M4 and M22, and that a small contribution from models with a $^{13}$C
pocket is required. With our assumption that $^{13}$C pockets form for initial
masses below a transition range between 3.0 and 3.5 M$_\odot$, we match the
light-to-heavy s-element ratio in the s-process residual of M22 and predict a
minimum enrichment timescale of between 240 and 360 Myr. Our predicted value is
consistent with the 300 Myr upper limit age difference between the two groups
derived from isochrone fitting.

Particular care is taken to include position-dependent lensing shear to
accurately account for the expected sizes and morphologies of highly-magnified
sources. We show that both source blending and shear reduce the completeness at
a given observed magnitude in the cluster, particularly near the critical
curves. These effects have a significant, but largely overlooked, impact on the
detectability of high-redshift sources behind clusters, and substantially
reduce the expected number of highly-magnified sources. The detections and
limits from both pointings result in a SFRD which is higher by 0.4+-0.4 dex
than previous estimates at z~10 from blank fields. Nevertheless, the
combination of these new results with all other estimates remain consistent
with a rapidly declining SFRD in the 170 Myr from z~8 to z~10 as predicted by
cosmological simulations and dark-matter halo evolution in LambdaCDM. Once
biases introduced by magnification-dependent completeness are accounted for,
the full six cluster and parallel Frontier Field program will be an extremely

the same instrument at different epochs for the two spectra has a much smaller

negligible effect (~0.006 dex). Assuming that systematic errors from the

B1 Ridge and clumps to its southwest. N2H+ shows the strongest emission, with
morphology similar to cool dust in the region, while HCO+ and HCN trace several
molecular outflows from a collection of protostars in the main core. We
identify a range of kinematic complexity, with N2H+ velocity dispersions
ranging from ~0.05-0.50 km/s across the field. Simultaneous continuum mapping
at 3 mm reveals six compact object detections, three of which are new
detections. A new non-binary dendrogram algorithm is used to analyze dense gas
structures in the N2H+ position-position-velocity (PPV) cube. The projected
sizes of dendrogram-identified structures range from about 0.01-0.34 pc.
Size-linewidth relations using those structures show that non-thermal
line-of-sight velocity dispersion varies weakly with projected size, while rms
variation in the centroid velocity rises steeply with projected size. Comparing
these relations, we propose that all dense gas structures in Barnard 1 have
comparable depths into the sky, around 0.1-0.2 pc; this suggests that
over-dense, parsec-scale regions within molecular clouds are better described

structural components, a central spheroid, which is the host galaxy, and an
extended polar disk. Both photometric and kinematic studies revealed that these
two components co-exist on two different planes within the central regions of
the galaxy. Aims. The aim of this work is to study the spectroscopic and
kinematic properties of the host galaxy and the polar disk in the central
regions of NGC 4650A by disentangling their contributions to the observed
galaxy spectrum.
  Methods. We applied the spectral decomposition technique introduced in
previous works to long-slit spectroscopic observations in the CaII triplet
region. We focused the analysis along the PA = 152 that corresponds to the
photometric minor axis of the host galaxy, where the superimposition of the two
components is more relevant and the spectral decomposition is necessary. We aim
to disentangle the stars that move in the equatorial plane of the host galaxy
from those that move in the meridan plane, which is along the polar disk.
  Results. We successfully disentangled the spectra of the two structural
components of NGC 4650A and measured their line-of-sight velocity and velocity
dispersion profiles, and the stellar content along PA = 152. The host galaxy
shows significant rotation along its photometric minor axis, indicating that
the gravitational potential is not axisymmetric. The polar disk shows a
kinematic decoupling: the inner regions counter-rotating with respect the
outer-regions and the host spheroid. This suggests a complex formation history
for the polar disk, characterised by mass accretion with decoupled angular
momenta.

they can sustain liquid water on their surfaces, i.e. that they orbit within
the habitable zone. However, the planet's magnetosphere should also be
considered, since without it, an exoplanet's atmosphere may be eroded away by
stellar winds. Aims: The aim of this paper is to investigate magnetospheric
protection of a planet from the effects of stellar winds from solar-mass stars.
Methods: We study hypothetical Earth-like exoplanets orbiting in the host
star's habitable zone for a sample of 124 solar-mass stars. These are targets
that have been observed by the Bcool collaboration. Using two wind models, we
calculate the magnetospheric extent of each exoplanet. These wind models are
computationally inexpensive and allow the community to quickly estimate the
magnetospheric size of magnetised Earth-analogues orbiting cool stars. Results:
Most of the simulated planets in our sample can maintain a magnetosphere of ~5
Earth radii or larger. This suggests that magnetised Earth analogues in the
habitable zones of solar analogues are able to protect their atmospheres and is
in contrast to planets around young active M dwarfs. In general, we find that
Earth-analogues around solar-type stars, of age 1.5 Gyr or older, can maintain
at least a Paleoarchean Earth sized magnetosphere. Our results indicate that
planets around 0.6 - 0.8 solar-mass stars on the low activity side of the
Vaughan-Preston gap are the optimum observing targets for habitable Earth
analogues.

waves) in the baryon fluid during recombination. In particular, we look at
their evolution in the presence of relative velocities between baryons and
photons on large scales ($k \sim 10^{-1} \ {\rm Mpc}^{-1}$), which are
naturally present during the era of decoupling. Previous work concluded that
the fluctuations grow due to an instability of sound waves in a recombining
plasma, but that the growth factor is small for typical cosmological models.
These analyses model recombination in an inhomogenous universe as a
perturbation to the parameters of the homogenous solution. We show that for
relevant wavenumbers $k\gtrsim 10^3\ {\rm Mpc}^{-1}$ the dynamics are
significantly altered by the transport of both ionizing continuum ($h\nu>13.6$
eV) and Lyman-$\alpha$ photons between crests and troughs of the density
perturbations. We solve the radiative transfer of photons in both these
frequency ranges and incorporate the results in a perturbed three-level atom
model. We conclude that the instability persists at intermediate scales. We use
the results to estimate a distribution of growth rates in $10^{7}$ random
realizations of large-scale relative velocities. Our results indicate that
there is no appreciable growth; out of these $10^7$ realizations, the maximum
growth factor we find is less than $\approx 1.2$ at wavenumbers of $k \approx
10^{3} \ {\rm Mpc}^{-1}$. The instability's low growth factors are due to the
relatively short duration of the recombination epoch during which the electrons

phase at temperatures above the superfluid transition. In three dimensions, we
predict a normal easy-axis/easy-plane ferromagnet for sufficiently strong

easy-axis ferromagnet is the bosonic analog of Stoner ferromagnetism known in

is shown to significantly lose in energy to the transverse ferromagnet in three

drops by a factor of 4-5, whereas the spectrum above 5 keV is essentially

confirm this with spectral fitting, finding that the spectral differences can
be well modelled by the addition of a partial covering neutral absorber, with a
column density of $\sim3\times 10^{22}$~cm$^{-2}$ and a covering fraction of
$\sim0.6$. The optical and UV fluxes are not affected, and indeed are
marginally brighter in the more recent observations, suggesting that only the
inner regions of the disk are affected by the absorption event. This indicates
either that the absorption is due to a cloud passing over the inner disk,
obscuring the X-ray source but leaving the outer disk untouched, or that the
absorber is dust-free so the UV continuum is unaffected. We use arguments based
on the duration of the event and the physical properties of the absorber to
constrain its size and location, and conclude that it is most likely a small

includes Doppler shifts which arise from winds and planetary motion. We model
jovian planets covering more than two orders of magnitude in incident flux,
corresponding to planets with 0.9 to 55 day orbital periods around solar-type
stars. The results of our 3-D dynamical models reveal certain aspects of high
resolution transmission spectra that are not present in simple 1-D models. We
find that the hottest planets experience strong substellar to anti-stellar
(SSAS) winds, resulting in transmission spectra with net blue shifts of up to 3
km s$^{-1}$, whereas less irradiated planets show almost no net Doppler shifts.
Compared to 1-D models, peak line strengths are significantly reduced for the
hottest atmospheres owing to Doppler broadening from a combination of rotation
(which is faster for close-in planets under the assumption of tidal locking)
and atmospheric winds. Finally, high resolution transmission spectra may be
useful in studying the atmospheres of exoplanets with optically thick clouds
since line cores for very strong transitions should remain optically thick to
very high altitude. High resolution transmission spectra are an excellent
observational test for the validity of 3-D atmospheric dynamics models, because
they provide a direct probe of wind structures and heat circulation.
Ground-based exoplanet spectroscopy is currently on the verge of being able to
verify some of our modeling predictions, most notably the dependence of SSAS
winds on insolation. We caution that interpretation of high resolution
transmission spectra based on 1-D atmospheric models may be inadequate, as 3-D

enabling us to identify 142 giant molecular clouds (GMCs) and 303 HII regions.
We have measured, and compared, their basic physical properties (radius,
velocity dispersion, luminosity). For the HII regions, we find two physical
regimes, one for masses $>10^{5.4} \mathrm{M_{\odot}}$ of ionized gas, where
the gas density increases with gas mass, the other for masses $<10^{5.4}

mass. For the GMCs, we find, in contrast to previous studies in other galaxies
over a generally lower mass range of clouds, that the gas surface density
increases with the radius, hinting at two regimes for these clouds if we
consider both sources of data. We also find that the GMC mass function has a
break at $10^{6.7}\mathrm{M_{\odot}}$. Using the velocity dispersion
measurements, we claim that the difference between the regimes is the nature of
the dominant binding force. For the regions in the lower mass range, the

the internal gravity of the clouds. In the regime where gravity is dominant,
the star formation rate, derived from the dust-corrected H$\alpha$ luminosity,
increases super-linearly with the velocity dispersion, and the gas density
increases with the gas mass.

of systems showing the absence of thermalisation following out-of-equilibrium

prove rigorously under simple assumptions on the spectrum that if a system
shows strong dynamical localisation, all of its many-body eigenvectors have

area law, hence the eigenvectors can be approximated by matrix-product states.

existence of a mobility edge above which transport is possible.

of analyzing thousands of simulated light curves blindly. The observational
properties of the light curves cover the range in quality obtained for current

(e.g.,~LSST), and include simulated systematic errors. \nteamsA\ teams
participated in TDC1, submitting results from \nmethods\ different method
variants. After a describing each method, we compute and analyze basic
statistics measuring accuracy (or bias) $A$, goodness of fit $\chi^2$,
precision $P$, and success rate $f$. For some methods we identify outliers as
an important issue. Other methods show that outliers can be controlled via
visual inspection or conservative quality control. Several methods are
competitive, i.e., give $|A|<0.03$, $P<0.03$, and $\chi^2<1.5$, with some of
the methods already reaching sub-percent accuracy. The fraction of light curves
yielding a time delay measurement is typically in the range $f = $20--40\%. It
depends strongly on the quality of the data: COSMOGRAIL-quality cadence and
light curve lengths yield significantly higher $f$ than does sparser sampling.
Taking the results of TDC1 at face value, we estimate that LSST should provide
around 400 robust time-delay measurements, each with $P<0.03$ and $|A|<0.01$,
comparable to current lens modeling uncertainties. In terms of observing
strategies, we find that $A$ and $f$ depend mostly on season length, while P
depends mostly on cadence and campaign duration.

embedded in a 10^8 solar mass NFW halo. HMXBs in a constant density environment
produce negligible enhanced ionization because of their high-energy SEDs and
short lifetimes. In this case, HMXBs only marginally contribute to the local
heating rate. For NFW profiles, radiation from main sequence stars cannot
prevent the initially ionized volume from recombining since it is unable to
penetrate the high density galactic core. However, HMXB photons stall
recombinations behind the front, keeping it partially ionized for longer. The
increased electron density in these partially ionized regions promotes further
cooling, resulting in lower IGM temperatures. In the context of this starburst
model, we have shown that HMXBs do not make a major contribution to
reionization or IGM heating. However, X-ray escape fractions are high in both

heavier than protons are present in the relativistic wind. Protons can only
reach maximum energies of ~ 10^19.5 eV, while intermediate and heavy nuclei are
able to reach values of ~ 10^20 eV and above. The spectra of nuclei escaping

flux expected on Earth using the GRB luminosity function from Wanderman & Piran

fraction of the energy dissipated at internal shocks, and that most of this
dissipated energy is communicated to accelerated CR, are able to reproduce the
magnitude of the UHECR flux observed. For these models, the observed shape of

obtained analytically up to the second-order perturbation regarding the
interaction strength $U$. High and low bias voltage properties are analyzed for
a generic multi-terminal dot, showing a crossover from the Kondo resonance to
the Coulomb peaks with increasing bias voltage. For a dot where the
particle-hole symmetry is not present, we construct a current-preserving
evaluation of the nonequilibrium spectral function for arbitrary bias voltage.
It is shown that finite bias voltage does not split the Kondo resonance in this
order, and no specific structure due to multiple leads emerges. Overall bias
dependence is quite similar to finite temperature effect for a dot with or

in quantum transport in a disordered electron system. Weak anti-localization
enhances the conductivity and weak localization suppresses the conductivity

destroy the quantum interference effect, giving rise to a cusp-like positive
and negative magnetoconductivity as the signatures of weak localization and
weak anti-localization, respectively. These effects have been widely observed
in topological insulators. In this article, we review recent progresses in both
theory and experiment of weak (anti-)localization in topological insulators,
where the quasiparticles are described as Dirac fermions. We predicted a
crossover from weak anti-localization to weak localization if the massless
Dirac fermions (such as the surface states of topological insulator) acquire a
Dirac mass, which was confirmed experimentally. The bulk states in a
topological insulator thin film can exhibit the weak localization effect, quite
different from other system with strong spin-orbit interaction. We compare the
localization behaviors of Dirac fermions with conventional electron systems in
the presence of disorders of different symmetries. Finally, we show that both
the interaction and quantum interference are required to account for the
experimentally observed temperature and magnetic field dependence of the

assumption that the emission is confined to a narrow cone about the tangent to
a dipolar field line. The widely accepted rotating vector model (RVM) is an
approximation in which the line of sight is fixed and the field line is not
strictly tangent to it. We refer to an exact treatment (Gangadhara 2004) as the
tangent model. In the tangent model (but not in the RVM) the visible point
changes as a function of pulsar rotational phase, $\psi$, defining a trajectory
on a sphere of radius $r$. We solve for the trajectory and for the angular
velocity of the visible point around it. We note the recent claim that this
motion is observable using interstellar holography (Pen et al. 2014). We
estimate the error introduced by use of the RVM and find that it is significant
for pulsars with emission over a wide range of $\psi$. The RVM tends to
underestimate the range of $\psi$ over which emission is visible. We suggest
that the geometry alone strongly favors the visible pulsar radio being emitted
at a heights more than ten percent of the light-cylinder distance, where our
neglect of retardation effects becomes significant.

transverse oscillations of a prominence and a filament and longitudinal
oscillation of another filament launched by a single shock wave. Using H-alpha
Doppler observations, we derive the three-dimensional oscillation velocities at
different heights along the prominence axis. The results indicate that the
prominence has a larger oscillation amplitude and damping time at higher
altitude, but the periods at different heights are the same (i.e., 13.5
minutes). This suggests that the prominence oscillates like a linear vertical
rigid body with one end anchored on the Sun. One of the filaments shows weak
transverse oscillation after the passing of the shock, which is possibly due to
the low altitude of the filament and the weakening (due to reflection) of the
shock wave before the interaction. Large amplitude longitudinal oscillation is
observed in the other filament after the passing of the shock wave. The
velocity amplitude and period are about 26.8 km/s and 80.3 minutes,
respectively. We propose that the orientation of a filament or prominence
relative to the normal vector of the incoming shock should be an important
factor for launching transverse or longitudinal filament oscillations. In
addition, the restoring forces of the transverse prominence are most likely due
to the coupling of gravity and magnetic tension of the supporting magnetic
field, while that for the longitudinal filament oscillation is probably the
resultant force of gravity and magnetic pressure.

$\mathfrak C_I$ are projective objects in the category of operator systems. We
show that an operator system from which all unital completely positive maps

Moreover, a finite dimensional operator system satisfying a perturbed lifting

narrow emission lines. The estimated black hole mass of ~ 10^7 Msun implies
bolometric nuclear luminosity close to the Eddington limit. SDSS J1100+4421 is
also extremely radio-loud, with a radio loudness parameter of R ~ 4 x 10^2 - 3

large-amplitude optical variability of the target, reminiscent of that found in
a few radio- and gamma-ray loud NLS1s, is therefore produced most likely in a
blazar-like core. The 1.4 GHz radio image of the source shows an extended

The exchange interactions are estimated as J_1 = - 51 K and J_2 = 36 K by
comparing the magnetic susceptibility, heat capacity, and magnetization data
with the data obtained using calculations by the exact diagonalization method.
High-field magnetization measurements at 1.3 K show a saturation above 26 T

to the penguin-dominated, color-suppressed tree dominated, and pure
annihilation nonleptonic $B$ decays. Combining the available experimental data
for $B_{u,d}$ ${\to}$ $\pi \pi$, ${\pi}K$ and $K \bar{K}$ decays, we do a
global fit on the spectator scattering and annihilation parameters
$X_H({\rho}_H$, ${\phi}_H)$, $X_A^i({\rho}_A^{i},{\phi}_A^{i})$ and
$X_A^f({\rho}_A^{f},{\phi}_A^{f})$, which are used to parameterize the endpoint
singularity in amplitudes of spectator scattering, nonfactorizable and
factorizable annihilation topologies within the QCD factorization framework, in
three scenarios for different purpose. Numerically, in scenario II, we get
$({\rho}_A^{i},{\phi}_A^{i}[^{\circ}])=(2.88^{+1.52}_{-1.30},-103^{+33}_{-40})$

$({\rho}_A^{f},{\phi}_A^{f}[^{\circ}])=(1.21^{+0.22}_{-0.25},-40^{+12}_{-8})$
at the $68\%$ confidence level, which are mainly demanded by resolving ${\pi}K$
puzzle and confirm the presupposition that $X_A^i\neq X_A^f$. In addition,
correspondingly, the $B$-meson wave function parameter $\lambda_B$ is also
fitted to be $0.18^{+0.11}_{-0.08}\, MeV$, which plays an important role for
resolving both ${\pi}K$ and $\pi\pi$ puzzles. With the fitted parameters, the
QCDF results for observables of $B_{u,d}$ $\to$ $\pi \pi$, $\pi K$ and $K

  measure",,,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The unrestricted LZ78 universal data-compression algorithm (as well as the
LZ77 and LZW versions) achieves asymptotically, as the block-length tends to
infinity, the FS compressibility, namely the best compression-ratio that may be
achieved by any Information-lossless(IL) block-to-variable finite-state(FS)
algorithm, for any infinitely-long individual sequence. The encoder parses the
sequence into distinct phrases where each newly generated phrase is a past
phrase which is already stored in a dictionary, extended by one letter. The
newly generated phrase is then added to the updated, ever-growing dictionary.
One heuristic approach is the ""Least Recently Utilized"" (LRU) deletion
approach, where only the most recent D entries are kept in the dictionary, thus
yielding a constrained-dictionary version of LZ78 denoted by LZ78(LRU). In this
note, for the sake of completeness, it is demonstrated again via a simple proof
that the unrestricted LZ78 algorithm asymptotically achieves the
FS-Compressibility. Then, it is demonstrated that the LZ78(LRU)
information-lossless data-compression algorithm also achieves the FS
compressibility, as the dictionary size D tends to infinity. Although this is
perhaps not surprising, it does nevertheless yield a theoretical optimality
argument for the popular LZ78(LRU) algorithm (and similarly, for the LZW(LRU)
algorithm). In addition, the finite-state compressibility of an individual
sequence under a constrained allowable distance measure between the original
sequence and the decompressed sequence is defined. It is demonstrated that a
particular adaptive vector-quantizer that sequentially replaces clusters of
L-vectors onto a single, cluster-representative L-vector, followed by a
constrained D-entries-dictionary version of LZ78(LRU) as above, is
asymptotically optimal as D tends to infinity and L= log D .

that, in primordially segregated clusters, the early, impulsive mass-loss from
stellar evolution of the most massive stars in the innermost regions of the
cluster leads to a stronger expansion than for initially non-segregated
clusters. Therefore, models in stronger tidal fields dissolve faster due to an
enhanced flux of stars over the tidal boundary. Throughout their lifetimes, the
segregated clusters are more extended by a factor of about 2, suggesting that
(at least) some of the very extended globular clusters in the outer halo of the
Milky Way may have been born with primordial mass segregation. We finally
derive a relation between star-cluster dissolution time, $T_{diss}$, and

$St^+=0.5, 5, 35$ and 125. The main purpose of this study is to examine the
effect of Stokes number on turbulence modification in a channel. We found that
particles with $St^+=0.5$ enhance turbulence by increasing the occurrence of
quasistreamwise vortices, while larger-Stokes-number particles attenuate
turbulence. When $St^+=0.5$, kinetic energy is transferred from the particles
to streamwise fluid velocity fluctuations in the high-speed regions and
low-speed streaks, which may increase the instability of the low-speed streaks
responsible for the birth of new quasistreamwise vortices. On the other hand,
the preferential concentration of larger-Stokes-number particles in low-speed
streaks is responsible for turbulence attenuation, and the slow response of the
particles to the fluid produces feedback against the fluid velocity associated
with quasistreamwise vortices.

event reported during the discovery of these planets. We applied the MEGNO
technique to identify regions in the phase space where a third planet can
maintain quasi-periodic orbits, and assessed the long-term stability of the
three-planet system by integrating the entire 5 bodies (binary + planets) for
10 Myr. We identified several stable regions between the two known planets as
well as a region beyond the orbit of Kepler-47c where the orbit of the third
planet could be stable. To constrain the orbit of this planet, we used the
measured duration of the unexplained transit event ($\sim 4.15$ hours) and
compared that with the transit duration of the third planet in an ensemble of
stable orbits. To remove the degeneracy among the orbits with similar transit
durations, we considered the planet to be in a circular orbit and calculated
its period analytically. The latter places an upper limit of 424 days on the
orbital period of the third planet. Our analysis suggests that if the
unexplained transit event detected during the discovery of the Kepler-47
circumbinary system is due to a planetary object, this planet will be in a low
eccentricity orbit with a semimajor axis smaller than 1.24 AU. Further
constraining of the mass and orbital elements of this planet requires a
re-analysis of the entire currently available data including those obtained
post-announcement of the discovery of this system. We present details of our
methodology and discuss the implication of the results.

accomplishment of the high accuracies of CMB measurements, accompanying
precision cosmology from LSS data is emphasized. We investigate the dynamical
dark energy models which can produce the same CMB angular power spectra as that
of the LCDM model with less than a sub-percent level accuracy. If one adopts
the dynamical DE models using the so-called Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL)
parametrization, w = w0 + wa(1-a), then one obtains models (w0,wa)=
(-0.8,-0.767), (-0.9,-0.375), (-1.1,0.355), (-1.2,0.688) named as M8, M9, M11,

to the redshift space distortions (RSD) between different DE models and the
LCDM model are about 0.2% only at z=0. The difference of f between M8 (M9, M11,
M12) and the LCDM model becomes maximum at z ~ 0.25 with -2.4 (-1.2, 1.2,
2.5)%. This is a scale-independent quantity. One can investigate the one-loop
correction of the matter power spectrum of each model using the standard
perturbation theory in order to probe the scale-dependent quantity in the
quasi-linear regime ({\it i.e.} k < 0.4 h/Mpc). The differences in the matter
power spectra including the one-loop correction between M8 (M9, M11, M12) and

departure from -1 of w0, the larger the difference in the power spectrum. Thus,
one should use both the RSD and the quasi-linear observable in order to
discriminate a viable DE model among a slew of models which are degenerated in
CMB. Also we obtain the lower limit on w0 > -1.5 from the CMB acoustic peaks
and this will provide the useful limitation on phantom models.

metallic we are able to obtain a Berry phase close to the value of {\pi}
expected for Dirac fermions of the topological surface states. This indicates
that we might have obtained evidence for the topological surface states in
metallic single crystals of Bi2Te3. Other physical quantities obtained from the
analysis of the SdH oscillations are also in close agreement with those
reported for the topological surface states. The linear magnetoresistance
observed in our sample, which is considered as a signature of the Dirac
fermions of the surface states, lends further credence to the existence of
topological surface states.

$M_{*} = 10^{8}M_{\odot}$ with mass ratios of $<$100:1 and line of sight
velocity differences of $\Delta V<500$ km s$^{-1}$. We find a significant
increase in mean asymmetries for projected separations less than the sum of the
individual galaxy's Petrosian 90 radii. For systems in major merger pairs with
mass ratios of $<$4:1 both galaxies in the pair show a strong increase in
asymmetry, while in minor merger systems (with mass ratios of $>$4:1) the lower
mass companion becomes highly asymmetric, while the larger galaxy is much less
affected. The fraction of highly asymmetric paired galaxies which have a major
merger companion is highest for the most massive galaxies and drops
progressively with decreasing mass. We calculate that the mass dependent major
merger fraction is fairly constant at $\sim1.3-2\%$ between
$10^{9.5}<M_{*}<10^{11.5} M_{\odot}$, and increases to $\sim4\%$ at lower
masses. When the observability time scales are taken into consideration, the

During the merging the cool filaments plasma heated up and started to move
along the both side of the compound flux rope i.e., toward north (approx 265
km/s) and south (approx 118 km/s) from the point of merging. After travelling a
distance of approx 150 Mm towards north the plasma become cool and started to
returns back towards south ( approx 14 km/s) after 02:00 UT. The observations
provide an clear example of compound flux rope formation via merging of two
different flux ropes and occurrence of flare through tether cutting
reconnection. However, the compound flux rope remained stable in the corona and
made an confined eruption. The coronal magnetic field decay index measurements
revealed that both the filaments and the compound flux rope axis lies within
the stability domain (decay index less than 1.5), which may be the possible
cause for their stability. The present study also deals with the relationship
between the filaments chirality (sinistral) and the helicity (positive) of the

in the photometric time series often greatly complicates or even hinders these
asteroseismic analyses. This drives the need for specialised methods of
preprocessing data to make them suitable for asteroseismic analysis. In this
paper we present the KASOC Filter, which is used to automatically prepare data
from the Kepler/K2 mission for asteroseismic analyses of solar-like planet host
stars. The methods are very effective at removing unwanted signals of both
instrumental and planetary origins and produce significantly cleaner
photometric time series than the original data. The methods are automated and
can therefore easily be applied to a large number of stars. The application of
the filter is not restricted to planetary hosts, but can be applied to any
solar-like or red giant stars observed by Kepler/K2.

orbiting the Algol type short-period eclipsing binary SW Lyncis (Kim et al.

were inferred from timing measurements of the system's primary and secondary
eclipses. We applied well-tested numerical techniques to accurately integrate
the orbits of the two companions and to test for chaotic dynamical behaviour.
We carried out the stability analysis within a systematic parameter survey
varying both the geometries and orientation of the orbits of the companions, as
well as their masses. In all our numerical integrations we found that the
proposed SW Lyn multi-body system is highly unstable on time-scales on the
order of 1000 years. Our results cast doubt on the interpretation that the
timing variations are caused by two companions. This work demonstrates that a
straightforward dynamical analysis can help to test whether a best-fit
companion-based model is a physically viable explanation for measured eclipse
timing variations. We conclude that dynamical considerations reveal that the
propsed SW Lyncis multi-body system most likely does not exist or the
companions have significantly different orbital properties as conjectured in

preservation of the gap under the SL(2,Z) action, and prove that the
singularity of the fluctuation problem in the presence of a magnetic field is
an accessory singularity. We finish with a preliminary investigation of the

possibility of a disk surface that is parallel to the light path from the star,

topological expansion. It is known that for every $d$ there are unbounded
degree simplicial complexes of dimension $d$ with these properties. However, a
major open problem, formulated by Gromov, is whether bounded degree high
dimensional expanders exist for $d \geq 2$.
  We present an explicit construction of bounded degree complexes of dimension

affirmative. Conditional on a conjecture of Serre on the congruence subgroup

detected at a level of L_X~10^{33} erg/s. This is the lowest luminosity at
which pulsations have ever been detected in an accreting pulsar. The derived
spin period is 351.13 s, consistent with previous observations. The source
continues its overall long-term spin-up, which reduced the spin period by 7.5 s

Space-time discrete symmetries $P$, $T$ and their combination $PT$ are

particle-antiparticle interchange and truly neutral particles. Spin and charge
multiplets, based on the interlocking representations of the Lorentz group, are

quantum fidelity associated with the first excited-state, in addition to the
conventional ground-state fidelity, the BKT-type transition and Majumdar-Ghosh
point of the $J_1-J_2$ chain ($J'=0$) are found to extend into the $J'-J_2$

believed to be extremely sensitive to the underlying phase and are thus well
suited for finite-size studies. Analysis of the fidelity susceptibilities
suggests that the $J',J_2 \ll J$ phase of the anisotropic triangular model is
either a collinear antiferromagnet or possibly a gapless disordered phase that

gamma rays with a peak around $1-3$ GeV in the region surrounding the galactic
center. This anomalous excess can be described well by a dark matter candidate

cross section of $< \sigma v > \simeq (1.4-2.0) \times 10^{-26} \;
\text{cm}^3/\text{s}$. In this work we explore the possibility of having such a
dark matter candidate within the framework of a radiative neutrino mass model.
The model is a simple extension of the standard model by an additional $U(1)_X$
gauge symmetry where the standard model neutrino masses arise both at tree
level as well as radiatively by the anomaly free addition of one singlet
fermion $N_R$ and two triplet fermions $\Sigma_{1R}, \Sigma_{2R}$ with suitable
Higgs scalars. The spontaneous gauge symmetry breaking is achieved in such a
way which results in a residual $Z_2$ symmetry and hence providing a stable
cold dark matter candidate. We show that the singlet fermionic dark matter
candidate in our model can give rise to the galactic center gamma ray excess.
The parameter space which simultaneously satisfy the constraints on relic
density, direct detection scattering as well as collider bounds essentially
corresponds to an s-wave resonance where the gauge boson mass $m_X$ is
approximately twice that of dark matter mass $m_{\chi}$. We also discuss the
compatibility of such a light fermion singlet dark matter with light neutrino

strongly coupled ion plasma (gas or liquid, composed of two ion species
immersed into a neutralizing electron background). We use an effective
potential method proposed recently by Baalrud and Daligaut [PRL, 110, 235001,
(2013)]. It allows us to extend the standard Chapman-Enskog procedure of
calculating the interdiffusion coefficients to the case of strong Coulomb
coupling. We compute binary diffusion coefficients for several ionic mixtures
and fit them by convenient expressions in terms of the generalized Coulomb
logarithm. These fits cover a wide range of plasma parameters spanning from
weak to strong Coulomb couplings. They can be used to simulate diffusion of
ions in ordinary stars as well as in white dwarfs and neutron stars.

momentum-resolved electron energy-loss spectroscopy to study the evolution of
the anisotropy of the electronic transition involving the low energy valence
electrons in the free-standing MoS2 systems as the layer thickness was reduced
to monolayer. We used the orientation and the spectral-density analysis to show
that indirect to direct band-gap transition is accompanied by a three- to
two-dimensional anisotropy cross-over. The result provides a logical
explanation for the large sensitivity of indirect transition to the change of
thickness compared with that for direct transition. By tracking the energy of
indirect transition, we also revealed the asymmetric response of the valence
band and conduction band to the quantum confinement effect. Our results have
implication for future optoelectronic applications of atomic thin MoS2.

curvature terms appearing in Lovelock gravity. We find that while the solution
of third-order Lovelock gravity with constant-curvature horizon in the absence
of a mass parameter is the anti de Sitter (AdS) metric, this kind of solution
with nonconstant- curvature horizon is only asymptotically AdS and may have
horizon. We also find that one may have an extreme black hole with non-constant
curvature horizon whose Ricci scalar is zero or a positive constant, while
there is no such black hole with constant-curvature horizon. Furthermore, the
thermodynamics of the black holes in the two cases of constant- and
nonconstant-curvature horizons are different drastically. Specially, we
consider the thermodynamics of black holes with vanishing Ricci scalar and find
that in contrast to the case of black holes of Lovelock gravity with
constant-curvature horizon, the area law of entropy is not satisfied. Finally,
we investigate the stability of these black holes both locally and globally and

for VoIP services over the period 1999-2014. The improvement of bandwidth can
be realized through; silence suppression measure of repressing the silent
portions (packets) in a voice conversation using Voice Activity Detection
algorithm; by so doing, the transmission rate during the inactive periods of
speech is reduced, and thus, the mean transmission rate can be reduced. A
second measure is packet header reduction which defines a process of
multiplexing and de-multiplexing packet headers to curb excesses. Voice/ Packet
Header compression is considered the most productive of all the techniques,
offering a scheme where VoIP packets are compressed from the 40 bytes of size
to a smaller byte size of 2 bytes. When combined with aggregation, compression
potentially yields a compressed size of up to 1 byte. In either case, bandwidth
save is reached using compression and decompression codecs of varying data and
bit rates. It is envisaged that an improvement in the performance of codecs
would yield a better result in terms of enhancing results favourably in Voice
over broadband networks

the quantum Bernstein-Vazirani algorithm. A previous paper (Floess et al. in
Math. Struct. in Comp. Science 23: 386, 2013) has proved that if a $n$-variable
Boolean function $f(x_1,\ldots,x_n)$ does not depend on an input variable
$x_i$, using the Bernstein-Vazirani circuit to $f$ will always obtain an output
$y$ that has a $0$ in the $i$th position. We generalize this result and show
that after one time running the algorithm, the probability of getting a 1 in
each position $i$ is equal to the dependence degree of $f$ on the variable
$x_i$, i.e. the influence of $x_i$ on $f$. On this foundation, we give an
approximation algorithm to evaluate the influence of any variable on a Boolean
function. Next, as an application, we use it to study the Boolean functions
with juntas, and construct probabilistic quantum algorithms to learn certain
Boolean functions. Compared with the deterministic algorithms given by Floess
et al., our probabilistic algorithms are faster.

fast particles expel slower ones from the wall leading to a segregated state.
The mechanism is understood as a function of particle velocities, particle
density, or channel width. In the presence of an external fluid flow, particles
with two different velocities segregate due to their different particle fluxes.
Promising applications can be found in the development of microfluidic
lab-on-a-chip devices for sorting of particles with different motilities.

partition of its domain $V(R)$ into a family of sets $(V_x)_{x\in X}$ such that
the restrictions of $R$ to two finite subsets $A$ and $A'$ of $V(R)$ are
isomorphic provided that the traces $A\cap V_x$ and $A'\cap V_x$ have the same
size for each $x\in X$. Let $\mathscr S_\mu $ be the class of relational
structures of signature $\mu$ which do not have a finite monomorphic
decomposition. We show that if a hereditary subclass $\mathscr D$ of $\mathscr
S_\mu $ is made of ordered relational structures then it contains a finite
subset $\mathfrak A$ such that every member of $\mathscr D$ embeds some member
of $\mathfrak A$. Furthermore, for each $R\in \mathfrak A$ the profile of the
age $\mathcal A(R)$ of $R$ (made of finite substructures of $R$) is at least
exponential. We deduce that if the profile of a hereditary class of finite
ordered structures is not bounded by a polynomial then it is at least
exponential. This result is a part of classification obtained by Balogh,
Bollob\'as and Morris (2006) for ordered graphs. {\it To cite this article:

theory. Some quantitative and qualitative measures describe the pattern of a
music signal, vary from one to another. Same musical recital, when played by
different instrumentalists, generates different types of music patterns. The
reason behind various patterns is the psychoacoustic measures - Dynamics,
Timber, Tonality and Rhythm, varies in each time. However, the psycho-acoustic
study of the music signals does not reveal any idea about the similarity
between the signals. For such cases, study of synchronization of long-term
nonlinear dynamics may provide effective results. In this context, phase
synchronization (PS) is one of the measures to show synchronization between two
non-identical signals. In fact, it is very critical to investigate any other
kind of synchronization for experimental condition, because those are
completely non identical signals. Also, there exists equivalence between the
phases and the distances of the diagonal line in Recurrence plot (RP) of the
signals, which is quantifiable by the recurrence quantification measure
tau-recurrence rate. This paper considers two nonlinear music signals based on
same raga played by two eminent sitar instrumentalists as two non-identical
sources. The psycho-acoustic study shows how the Dynamics, Timber, Tonality and
Rhythm vary for the two music signals. Then, long term analysis in the form of
phase space reconstruction is performed, which reveals the chaotic phase spaces
for both the signals. From the RP of both the phase spaces, tau-recurrence rate
is calculated. Finally by the correlation of normalized tau-recurrence rate of
their 3D phase spaces and the PS of the two music signals has been established.
The numerical results well support the analysis.

the preferred packing of the fluid particles and the packing constraints
imposed by the confining surfaces, is studied for a dense hard-sphere fluid
confined between planar hard surfaces at short separations. The detailed
mechanism for the frustration is investigated via an analysis of the
anisotropic pair distributions of the confined fluid, as obtained from integral
equation theory for inhomogeneous fluids at pair correlation level within the
anisotropic Percus-Yevick approximation. By examining the mean forces that
arise from interparticle collisions around the periphery of each particle in
the slit, we calculate the principal components of the mean force for the
density profile - each component being the sum of collisional forces on a
particle's hemisphere facing either surface. The variations of these components
with the slit width give rise to rather intricate changes in the layer
structure between the surfaces, but, as shown in this paper, the basis of these
variations can be easily understood qualitatively and often also
semi-quantitatively. It is found that the ordering of the fluid is in essence
governed locally by the packing constraints at each single solid-fluid
interface. A simple superposition of forces due to the presence of each surface
gives surprisingly good estimates of the density profiles, but there remain
nontrivial confinement effects that cannot be explained by superposition, most
notably the magnitude of the excess adsorption of particles in the slit
relative to bulk.

components of financial institutions arise to cater for an increasing demand
for electronic money, micro-payment systems, Virtual money and cryptographic
(Crypto) currencies. In particular, this paper proposes a framework of risk
identification and assessment applied to Virtual and Crypto currencies from a
banking regulation perspective. In doing so, it addresses the topical issues of
understanding important key Operational Risk vulnerabilities and exposure risk
drivers under the framework of the Basel II/III banking regulation,
specifically associated with Virtual and Crypto currencies. This is critical to
consider should such alternative currencies continue to grow in utilisation to
the point that they enter into the banking sector, through commercial banks and
financial institutions who are beginning to contemplate their recognition in
terms of deposits, transactions and exchangeability for fiat currencies.
  We highlight how some of the features of Virtual and Crypto currencies are
important drivers of Operational Risk, posing both management and regulatory
challenges that must start to be considered and addressed both by regulators,
central banks and security exchanges. In this paper we focus purely on the
Operational Risk perspective of banks operating in an environment where such
electronic Virtual currencies are available. Some aspects of this discussion
are directly relevant now, whilst others can be understood as discussions to
raise awareness of issues in Operational Risk that will arise as Virtual

molecules (aka metabolites) that appear in a person's biofluids, which means
such diseases can often be readily detected from a person's ""metabolic
profile"". This information can be extracted from a biofluid's NMR spectrum.
Today, this is often done manually by trained human experts, which means this
process is relatively slow, expensive and error-prone. This paper presents a
tool, Bayesil, that can quickly, accurately and autonomously produce a complex
biofluid's (e.g., serum or CSF) metabolic profile from a 1D1H NMR spectrum.
This requires first performing several spectral processing steps then matching
the resulting spectrum against a reference compound library, which contains the
""signatures"" of each relevant metabolite. Many of these steps are novel
algorithms and our matching step views spectral matching as an inference
problem within a probabilistic graphical model that rapidly approximates the
most probable metabolic profile. Our extensive studies on a diverse set of
complex mixtures, show that Bayesil can autonomously find the concentration of
all NMR-detectable metabolites accurately (~90% correct identification and ~10%
quantification error), in <5minutes on a single CPU. These results demonstrate
that Bayesil is the first fully-automatic publicly-accessible system that
provides quantitative NMR spectral profiling effectively -- with an accuracy
that meets or exceeds the performance of trained experts. We anticipate this

and radiative processes lead to a significant suppression of final $D$-meson
spectra at high transverse momentum and a finite flow of heavy quarks inside
the fluid dynamical evolution of the light partons. The $D$-meson nuclear

higher-order Markov chain. Although this system has attractive theoretical
properties, it is computationally intractable for many interesting problems. We
next study a computationally tractable approximation to the higher-order
PageRank vector that involves a system of polynomial equations called
multilinear PageRank, which is a type of tensor PageRank vector. It is
motivated by a novel ""spacey random surfer"" model, where the surfer remembers
bits and pieces of history and is influenced by this information. The
underlying stochastic process is an instance of a vertex-reinforced random
walk. We develop convergence theory for a simple fixed-point method, a shifted
fixed-point method, and a Newton iteration in a particular parameter regime. In
marked contrast to the case of the PageRank vector of a Markov chain where the
solution is always unique and easy to compute, there are parameter regimes of
multilinear PageRank where solutions are not unique and simple algorithms do
not converge. We provide a repository of these non-convergent cases that we
encountered through exhaustive enumeration and randomly sampling that we
believe is useful for future study of the problem.

The graph $G$ is well-dominated if all its minimal dominating sets are of the

not known. We show that recognizing well-dominated graphs can be done
polynomially for graphs without cycles of lengths $4$ and $5$, by proving that
a graph belonging to this family is well-dominated if and only if it is
well-covered.
  Assume that a weight function $w$ is defined on the vertices of $G$. Then $G$
is $w$-well-dominated} if all its minimal dominating sets are of the same

We prove that $WWD(G)$ is a subspace of $WCW(G)$, the vector space of weight

applications. Its provision requires the careful fusion of diverse information

may either come from signal transmissions with respect to fixed anchors, from
cooperative transmissions inbetween agents, or from radar-like monostatic
transmissions. Using a-priori knowledge of a floor plan of the environment,
specular multipath components can be exploited, based on a geometric-stochastic
channel model. In this paper, a unified framework is presented for the
quantification of this type of position-related information, using the concept
of equivalent Fisher information. We derive analytical results for the
Cram\'er-Rao lower bound of multipath-assisted positioning, considering
bistatic transmissions between agents and fixed anchors, monostatic
transmissions from agents, cooperative measurements inbetween agents, and
combinations thereof, including the effect of clock offsets. Awareness of this
information enables highly accurate and robust indoor positioning.
Computational results show the applicability of the framework for the
characterization of the localization capabilities of a given environment,
quantifying the influence of different system setups, signal parameters, and

This class includes many of the proposed models in the literature, and it can
accommodate various functional forms of the infection force. For such models,
the vector-host/host-vector contact network topology gives rise to a bipartite

transmitted diseases. Under the assumption that the contact network is strongly
connected, we can define the basic reproductive number $\mathcal{R}_0$ and show
that this system has only two equilibria: the so called disease free

endemic equilibrium (EE)---that exists if, and only if, $\mathcal{R}_0>1$. We
also show that, if $\mathcal{R}_0\leq1$, then the DFE equilibrium is globally
asymptotically stable, while when $\mathcal{R}_0>1$, we have that the EE is
