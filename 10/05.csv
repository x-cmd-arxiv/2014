thermally emitting neutron stars (NSs). They are most probably characterized by
a magnetic field strength that is roughly two orders of magnitude lower than
that of most of the radio and accreting pulsars. The thermal emission of CCOs
can be modeled to obtain constraints on the physical parameters of the star
such as its mass, radius, effective temperature, and chemical composition.
Aims: The CCO in HESS, J1731-347 is one of the brightest objects of this class.
We present our analysis of two new XMM-Newton observations of the source which
increase the total exposure time of the by a factor of five compared to the
analyses presented before. Methods: We use our numerical spectral models for
carbon and hydrogen atmospheres to fit the spectrum of the CCO. From our fits,
we derive constraints on the physical parameters of the emitting star. We also
use the new data to derive new upper limits on pulsations and to confirm the
absence of a long-term variability. Results: The analysis shows that atmosphere
spectral models are clearly preferred by the fit over the blackbody function.
Under the assumption that the X-ray emission is uniformly produced by the
entire star surface, hydrogen atmosphere models lead to uncomfortably large
distances of the CCO, above 7-8 kpc. On the other hand, the carbon atmosphere
model formally excludes distances above 5-6 kpc and is compatible with the
source located in the Scutum-Crux (3 kpc) or Norma-Cygnus (4.5 kpc) Galactic
spiral arm. We provide and discuss the corresponding confidence contours in the
NS mass-radius plane. The measured effective temperature indicates that the NS
is exceptionally hot for the estimated age of 30 kyr. We discuss possible
cooling scenarios to explain this property, as well as possible additional
constraints on the star mass and radius from cooling theory.

The analysis is focused on the fractional Debye-Stokes-Einstein relation FDSE
sigma times tau to the power S equals const., where tau and sigma are for the
structural relaxation time and electric conductivity are functions of T and P,
respectively. For temperature tests in glycerol the clear evidence for the
almost coupled exponent S equals 1 was obtained. For the supercooled
nanocolloid the crossover to the decoupled domain associated with S equals 0.91
was noted. In super pressed glycerol and the nanocolloid the clear cross over
from the domain described by the exponent S equals 1 to S less than 1 appeared
on the GPa domain. For the nanocolloid it is associated with particularly
strong decoupling, related to S equals 0.5, and occurs at well-defined

to the validity of the Debye-Stokes tau equals approx. eta over T and Maxwell

with Earth- to Neptune-sized objects that reside well inside the orbit of
Mercury, around their respective host stars. How and where these close-in
planets formed is one of the major unanswered questions in planet formation.
Here we calculate the required disk masses for {\it in situ} formation of the
{\it Kepler} planets. We find that, if close-in planets formed as {\it
isolation masses}, then standard gas-to-dust ratios yield corresponding gas
disks that are gravitationally unstable for a significant fraction of systems,
ruling out such a scenario. We show that the maximum width of a planet's
accretion region in the absence of any migration is $2 v_{esc}/\Omega$, where
$v_{esc}$ is the escape velocity of the planet and $\Omega$ the Keplerian
frequency and use it to calculate the required disk masses for {\it in situ}
formation with giant impacts. Even with giant impacts, formation without
migration requires disk surface densities in solids at semi-major axes less
than 0.1~AU of $10^3-10^5 \rm{~g~cm^{-2}}$ implying typical enhancements above
the minimum-mass solar nebular (MMSN) by at least a factor of 20. Corresponding
gas disks are below, but not far from, the gravitational stability limit. In
contrast, formation beyond a few AU is consistent with MMSN disk masses. This
suggests that migration of either solids or fully assembled planets is likely
to have played a major role in the formation of close-in super-Earths and
mini-Neptunes.

characterization of the gamma process as a completely random measure (CRM), and
we explicitly derive the rate measure of our construction using Poisson process

for other nonparametric models based on the Dirichlet and beta processes. Our
representation is then used to derive a variational inference algorithm for a
particular Bayesian nonparametric latent structure formulation known as the
infinite Gamma-Poisson model, where the latent variables are drawn from a gamma

the key observation of expanding OB associations. Now we see that these
associations are an intermediate scale in a cascade of hierarchical structures
that begins on the ambient Jeans length close to a kiloparsec in size and
continues down to the interiors of clusters, perhaps even to binary and
multiple stellar systems. The origin of this structure lies with the dynamical
nature of cloud and star formation, driven by supersonic turbulence and
interstellar gravity. Dynamical star formation is relatively fast compared to
the timescale for cosmic accretion, and then the star formation rate keeps up
with the accretion rate, leading to a sequence of near-equilibrium states
during galaxy formation and evolution. Dynamical star formation also helps to
explain the formation of bound clusters, which require a local efficiency that
exceeds the average by more than an order of magnitude. Efficiency increases
with density in a hierarchically structured gas. Cluster formation should vary
with environment as the relative degree of cloud self-binding varies, and this
depends on the ratio of the interstellar velocity dispersion to the galaxy
rotation speed. As this ratio increases, galaxies become more clumpy, thicker,
and have more tightly bound star-forming regions. The formation of old globular
clusters is understood in this context, with the metal-rich and metal-poor
globulars forming in high-mass and low-mass galaxies, respectively, because of
the galactic mass-metallicity relation. Metal-rich globulars remain in the
disks and bulge regions where they formed, while metal-poor globulars get
captured as parts of satellite galaxies and end up in today's spiral galaxy
halos. Blue globulars in the disk could have formed very early when the whole
Milky Way had a low mass.

routing. In this paper, we consider a simplified architecture where a
connection between two routers is represented as a link joining two network
interfaces. When a connection is not used, both network interfaces can be
turned off. Therefore, in order to reduce power consumption, the goal is to
find the routing that minimizes the number of used links while satisfying all
the demands. We first define formally the problem and we model it as an integer
linear program. Then, we prove that this problem is not in APX, that is there
is no polynomial-time constant-factor approximation algorithm. We propose a
heuristic algorithm for this problem and we also prove some negative results
about basic greedy and probabilistic algorithms. Thus we present a study on
specific topologies, such as trees, grids and complete graphs, that provide
bounds and results useful for real topologies. We then exhibit the gain in
terms of number of network interfaces (leading to a global reduction of
approximately 33 MWh for a medium-sized backbone network) for a set of existing
network topologies: we see that for almost all topologies more than one third
of the network interfaces can be spared for usual ranges of operation. Finally,
we discuss the impact of energy efficient routing on the stretch factor and on
fault tolerance.

primary concern in convex analysis since its conception. It is well-known that
if a convex function has a minimum, then that minimum is global. The
minimizers, however, may not be unique. There are certain subclasses, such as
strictly convex functions, that do have unique minimizers when the minimum
exists, but other subclasses, such as constant functions, that do not. This
paper addresses the question of how many convex functions have unique
minimizers. We show, using Baire category theory, that the set of proximal
mappings of convex functions that have a unique fixed point is generic.
Consequently, the set of classes of convex functions that have unique
minimizers is generic.

bacteria as the basic element of the system is initially motivated by a
phenomenon called \emph{Quorum Sensing}. Due to high randomness in the
individual behavior of a bacterium, reliable communication between two bacteria
is almost impossible. Therefore, we have recently proposed that a population of
bacteria in a cluster is considered as a bio node in the network capable of
molecular transmission and reception. This proposition enables us to form a
reliable bio node out of many unreliable bacteria.
  In this paper, we study the communication between two nodes in such a network
where information is encoded in the concentration of molecules by the
transmitter. The molecules produced by the bacteria in the transmitter node
propagate through the diffusion channel. Then, the concentration of molecules
is sensed by the bacteria population in the receiver node which would decode
the information and output light or fluorescent as a result. The uncertainty in
the communication is caused by all three components of communication, i.e.,
transmission, propagation and reception. We study the theoretical limits of the
information transfer rate in the presence of such uncertainties. Finally, we
consider M-ary signaling schemes and study their achievable rates and
corresponding error probabilities.

communications. Recently, we studied molecular communication between two nodes
formed from synthetic bacteria. Due to high randomness in behavior of bacteria,
we used a population of them in each node. The reliability of such
communication systems depends on both the maximum concentration of molecules
that a transmitter node is able to produce at the receiver node as well as the
number of bacteria in each nodes. This maximum concentration of molecules falls
with distance which makes the communication to the far nodes nearly impossible.
In order to alleviate this problem, in this paper, we propose to use a
molecular relaying node. The relay node can resend the message either by the
different or the same type of molecules as the original signal from the
transmitter. We study two scenarios of relaying. In the first scenario, the
relay node simply senses the received concentration and forwards it to the
receiver. We show that this sense and forward scenario, depending on the type
of molecules used for relaying, results in either increasing the range of
concentration of molecules at the receiver or increasing the effective number
of bacteria in the receiver node. For both cases of sense and forward relaying,
we obtain the resulting improvement in channel capacity. We conclude that
multi-type molecular relaying outperforms the single-type relaying. In the
second scenario, we study the decode and forward relaying for the M-ary
signaling scheme. We show that this relaying strategy increases the reliability
of M-ary communication significantly.

stimulus mixing. Here, we present a theoretical analysis of the consequences of
common forms of stimulus mixing observed in cortical responses. We show that
some of these mixing rules can severely compromise the brain's ability to

incurred by even large reductions in the gain or large increases in neural
variability, explaining why the benefits of attention can be understood
primarily in terms of a stimulus selection, or demixing, mechanism rather than
purely as a gain increase or noise reduction mechanism. The cost of stimulus
mixing becomes even higher when the number of encoded objects increases,
suggesting a novel mechanism that might contribute to set size effects observed
in myriad psychophysical tasks. We further show that a specific form of neural
correlation and heterogeneity in stimulus mixing among the neurons can
partially alleviate the harmful effects of stimulus mixing. Finally, we derive
simple conditions that must be satisfied for unharmful mixing of stimuli.

feature of the method is that it naturally preserves the important Gauss law,
namely $\nabla\cdot\boldsymbol{B}=0$. In contrast to most existing approaches
that eliminate the electrical field variable $\boldsymbol{E}$ and give a direct
discretization of the magnetic field, our new approach discretizes the electric
field $\boldsymbol{E}$ by N\'{e}d\'{e}lec type edge elements for
$H(\mathrm{curl})$, while the magnetic field $\boldsymbol{B}$ by Raviart-Thomas
type face elements for $H(\mathrm{div})$. As a result, the divergence-free
condition on the magnetic field holds exactly on the discrete level. For this
new finite element method, an energy stability estimate can be naturally
established in an analogous way as in the continuous case. Furthermore,
well-posedness is rigorously established in the paper for both the Picard and
Newton linearization of the fully nonlinear systems by using the Brezzi theory
for both the continuous and discrete cases. This well-posedness naturally leads
to robust (and optimal) preconditioners for the linearized systems.

relates to its application to simulating dynamics of another quantum system of
interest. Here we study the building blocks for simulating quantum spin systems
with linear optics. We experimentally generate the eigenstates of the XY
Hamiltonian under an external magnetic field. The implemented quantum circuit
consists of two CNOT gates, which are realized experimentally by harnessing
entanglement from a photon source and by applying a CPhase gate. We tune the
ratio of coupling constants and magnetic field by changing local parameters.
This implementation of the XY model using linear quantum optics might open the
door to the future studies of quenching dynamics using linear optics.

path connecting some nodes. While it is known that stable allocations in such

with multiple sellers are not fully understood even in single-source
single-sink networks. In this work, we show that for a large class of natural
buyer demand functions, we are guaranteed the existence of an equilibrium with
several desirable properties. The crucial insight that we gain into the
equilibrium structure allows us to obtain tight bounds on efficiency in terms
of the various parameters governing the market, especially the number of
monopolies M. All of our efficiency results extend to markets without the
network structure.
  While it is known that monopolies can cause large inefficiencies in general,
our main results for single-source single-sink networks indicate that for
several natural demand functions the efficiency only drops linearly with M. For
example, for concave demand we prove that the efficiency loss is at most a
factor 1+M/2 from the optimum, for demand with monotone hazard rate it is at
most 1+M, and for polynomial demand the efficiency decreases logarithmically
with M. In contrast to previous work that showed that monopolies may adversely
affect welfare, our main contribution is showing that monopolies may not be as
`evil' as they are made out to be; the loss in efficiency is bounded in many
natural markets. Finally, we consider more general, multiple-source networks
and show that in the absence of monopolies, mild assumptions on the network
topology guarantee an equilibrium that maximizes social welfare.

transfer is pulse-based, information may be dynamically routed through a neural

symmetric-key encryption and key agreement protocols which are very fundamental
primitives in cryptography. In general, we can formalize information-theoretic
security in various ways: some of them can be formalized as stand-alone
security by extending (or relaxing) Shannon's perfect secrecy or by other ways
such as semantic security; some of them can be done based on composable
security. Then, a natural question about this is: what is the gap between the
formalizations? To answer the question, we investigate relationships between
several formalizations of information-theoretic security for symmetric-key
encryption and key agreement protocols. Specifically, for symmetric-key
encryption protocols in a general setting including the case where there exist
decryption-errors, we deal with the following formalizations of security:
formalizations extended (or relaxed) from Shannon's perfect secrecy by using
mutual information and statistical distance; information-theoretic analogues of
indistinguishability and semantic security by Goldwasser and Micali; and
composable security by Maurer et al. and Canetti. Then, we explicitly show the
equivalence and non-equivalence between those formalizations. Under the model,
we also derive lower bounds on the adversary's (or distinguisher's) advantage
and the size of secret-keys required under all of the above formalizations.
Although some of them may be already known, we can explicitly derive them all
at once through our relationships between the formalizations. In addition, we
briefly observe impossibility results which easily follow from the lower
bounds. The similar results are also shown for key agreement protocols in a

aspects of spike generation in excitable cells. However, the HH model was
proposed in 1952 when the real structure of the ion channel was unknown. It is
now common knowledge that in many ion-channel proteins the flow of ions through
the pore is governed by a gate, comprising a so-called selectivity filter
inside the ion channel, which can be controlled by electrical interactions. The
selectivity filter is believed to be responsible for the selection and fast
conduction of particular ions across the membrane of an excitable cell. Other
(generally larger) parts of the molecule such as the pore-domain gate control
the access of ions to the channel protein. In fact, two types of gates are
considered here for ion channels: the external gate, which is the voltage
sensitive gate, and the internal gate which is the selectivity filter gate
(SFG). Some quantum effects are to expected in the SFG due to its small
dimensions, which may play an important role in the operation of an ion
channel. Here, we examine parameters in a generalized model of HH to see
whether any parameter affects the spike generation. Our results indicate that
the previously suggested semi-quantum-classical equation proposed by Bernroider
and Summhammer (BS) agrees strongly with the HH equation under different
conditions and may even provide a better explanation in some cases. We conclude
that the BS model can refine the classical HH model substantially.

The performance of interferometers has largely been increased over
the last ten years. But the number of observable objects is still limited due
to the low sensitivity and imaging capability of the current facilities.
Studies have been done to propose a new generation of interferometers. Aims.
The Carlina concept studied at the Haute-Provence Observatory consists in an
optical interferometer configured as a diluted version of the Arecibo radio
telescope: above the diluted primary mirror made of fixed co-spherical
segments, a helium balloon or cables suspended between two mountains and/or
pylons, carries a gondola containing the focal optics. This concept does not
require delay lines. Methods. Since 2003, we have been building a technical
demonstrator of this diluted telescope. The main goals of this project were to
find the opto-mechanical solutions to stabilize the optics attached under
cables at several tens of meters above the ground, and to characterize this
diluted telescope under real conditions. In 2012, we have obtained metrology
fringes, and co-spherized the primary mirrors within one micron accuracy. In
2013, we have tested the whole optical train: servo loop, metrology, and the
focal gondola. Results. We obtained stellar fringes on Deneb in September 2013.
In this paper, we present the characteristics of these observations: quality of
the guiding, S /N reached, and possible improvements for a future system.
Conclusions. It is an important step that demonstrates the feasibility of
building a diluted telescope using cables strained between cliffs or pylons.
Carlina, like the MMT or LBT, could be one of the first members of a new class
of telescopes named Large Diluted Telescopes. Its optical architecture has many
advantages for future projects: Planet Formation Imager, Post-ELTs,
Interferometer in space.

orientation and defect structures of a circular cylindrical particle with flat
ends under a homeotropic anchoring condition in a uniform nematic medium.
Different aspect ratios of this colloidal geometry from thin discotic to long
rod-like shapes and several colloidal length scales ranging from mesoscale to
nanoscale are investigated. We show that the equilibrium state of this
colloidal geometry is sensitive to the two geometrical parameters: aspect ratio
and length scale of the particle. For a large enough mesoscopic particle, there
is a specific asymptotic equilibrium angle associated to each aspect ratio.
Upon reducing the particle size to nanoscale, the equilibrium angle follows a
descending or ascending trend in such a way that the equilibrium angle of a
particle with the aspect ratio bigger than 1:1 (a discotic particle) goes to a
parallel alignment with respect to the far field nematic, whereas the
equilibrium angle for a particle with the aspect ratio 1:1 and smaller (a
rod-like particle) tends toward a perpendicular alignment to the uniform
nematic direction. The discrepancy between the equilibrium angles of the
mesoscopic and nanoscopic particles originates from the significant differences
between their defect structures. The possible defect structures related to
mesoscopic and nanoscopic colloidal particles of this geometry are also
introduced.

contrast with the corresponding classical perspective, where all physical
observables are jointly measurable. It is of interest to examine if the results
of two or more measurements in the quantum scenario can be perceived from a
classical point of view or they still exhibit non-classical features. Clearly,
commuting observables can be measured jointly using projective measurements and
their statistical outcomes can be discerned classically. However, such simple
minded association of compatibility of measurements with commutativity turns
out to be limited in an extended framework, where the usual notion of sharp
projective valued measurements of self adjoint observables gets broadened to
include unsharp measurements of generalized observables constituting positive
operator valued measures (POVM). There is a surge of research activity recently
towards gaining new physical insights on the emergence of classical behavior
via joint measurability of unsharp observables. Here, we explore the entropic
uncertainty relation for a pair of discrete observables (of Alice's system)
when an entangled quantum memory of Bob is restricted to record outcomes of
jointly measurable POVMs only. Within the joint measurability regime, the sum
of entropies associated with Alice's measurement outcomes - conditioned by the
results registered at Bob's end - are constrained to obey an entropic steering
inequality. In this case, Bob's non-steerability reflects itself as his
inability in predicting the outcomes of Alice's pair of non-commuting
observables with better precision, even when they share an entangled state. As
a further consequence, the quantum advantage envisaged for the construction of
security proofs in key distribution is lost, when Bob's measurements are
restricted to the joint measurability regime.

problems has been recently receiving renewed attention after a series of
breakthrough impossibility results. From an algorithmic perspective, the
related questions concern whether there are compact formulations even for

  We propose a framework for proving lower bounds on the size of extended

that we call product relaxations and is motivated by the study of the
Sherali-Adams (SA) hierarchy. Then we show that for every approximate
relaxation of a polytope P, there is a product relaxation that has the same
size and is at least as strong. We provide a methodology for proving lower
bounds on the size of approximate product relaxations by lower bounding the
chromatic number of an underlying hypergraph, whose vertices correspond to
gap-inducing vectors.
  We extend the definition of product relaxations and our methodology to mixed
integer sets. However in this case we are able to show that mixed product
relaxations are at least as powerful as a special family of extended
formulations. As an application of our method we show an exponential lower
bound on the size of approximate mixed product formulations for the metric
capacitated facility location problem, a problem which seems to be intractable
for linear programming as far as constant-gap compact formulations are
concerned.

time-consuming. Understanding the factors that may positively or negatively
affect testing effort will point to possibilities for reducing this effort.
Consequently there is a significant body of research that has investigated
relationships between static code properties and testability. The work reported
in this paper complements this body of research by providing an empirical
evaluation of the degree of association between runtime properties and
class-level testability in object-oriented (OO) systems. The motivation for the
use of dynamic code properties comes from the success of such metrics in
providing a more complete insight into the multiple dimensions of software
quality. In particular, we investigate the potential relationships between the
runtime characteristics of production code, represented by Dynamic Coupling and
Key Classes, and internal class-level testability. Testability of a class is
considered here at the level of unit tests and two different measures are used
to characterise those unit tests. The selected measures relate to test scope
and structure: one is intended to measure the unit test size, represented by
test lines of code, and the other is designed to reflect the intended design,
represented by the number of test cases. In this research we found that Dynamic
Coupling and Key Classes have significant correlations with class-level
testability measures. We therefore suggest that these properties could be used
as indicators of class-level testability. These results enhance our current
knowledge and should help researchers in the area to build on previous results
regarding factors believed to be related to testability and testing. Our
results should also benefit practitioners in future class testability planning
and maintenance activities.

of infinite Hermitian matrices is studied. Firstly, we show that the ergodic
components of Hua-Pickrell probability measures have no Gaussian factors, this
extends a result of Alexei Borodin and Grigori Olshanski. Secondly, we show
that the sequence of asymptotic eigenvalues of Hua-Pickrell random matrices is
balanced in certain sense and has a ""principal value"" coincides with the
$\gamma_1$ parameter of ergodic components. This allow us to complete the
program of Borodin and Olshanski on the description of the ergodic
decomposition of Hua-Pickrell probability measures. Finally, we extend the
aforesaid results to the case of infinite Hua-Pickrell measues. By using the
theory of $\sigma$-finite infinite determinantal measures recently introduced
by A. I. Bufetov, we are able to identify the ergodic decomposition of
Hua-Pickrell infinite measures to some explicit $\sigma$-finite determinantal
measures on the space of point configurations in $\mathbb{R}^*$. The paper
resolves a problem of Borodin and Olshanski.

parallel imaging and projection due to coherent artifacts, such as speckle. In
contrast, traditional incoherent light sources, such as thermal sources or
light emitting diodes (LEDs), provide relatively low power per independent
spatial mode. Here, we present a chip-scale, electrically-pumped semiconductor
laser based on a novel design, demonstrating high power per mode with much
lower spatial coherence than conventional laser sources. The laser resonator
was fabricated with a chaotic, D-shaped cavity optimized to achieve highly
multimode lasing. Lasing occurs simultaneously and independently in ~1000
modes, and hence the total emission exhibits very low spatial coherence.
Speckle-free full-field imaging is demonstrated using the chaotic cavity laser
as the illumination source. The power per mode of the sample illumination is
several orders of magnitude higher than that of a LED or thermal light source.
Such a compact, low-cost source, which combines the low spatial coherence of a
LED with the high spectral radiance of a laser, could enable a wide range of
high-speed, full-field imaging and projection applications.

instantiated the so-called quantum Cheshire Cat experiment using neutron
interferometry. Crucial to this claim are the weak values which must imply the
quantum Cheshire Cat interpretation, i.e., ""the neutron and its spin are
spatially separated"" in their experiment. While they measured the correct weak
values for the quantum Cheshire Cat interpretation, the corresponding
implications do not obtain because, as we show, those weak values were measured
with both a quadratic and a linear magnetic field Bz interaction. We show
explicitly how those weak values imply quantum Cheshire Cat if the Bz
interaction is linear and then we show how the quadratic Bz interaction
destroys the quantum Cheshire Cat implications of those weak values. Since both
linear and quadratic Bz interactions contribute equally to the neutron
intensity in this experiment, the deviant weak value implications are
unavoidable. Because weak values were used successfully to compute neutron
intensities for weak Bz in this experiment, it is clearly the case that one
cannot make ontological inferences from weak values without taking into account
the corresponding interaction strength.

changed in a process of strong interaction, it is directly transferred to the
top quark decay products. The top quark spin can be deduced by studying angular
distributions of the decay products. The Standard Model predicts the
top/anti-top quark ($t\bar{t}$) pairs to have correlated spins. The degree is
sensitive to the spin and the production mechanisms of the top quark. Measuring
the spin correlation allows to test the predictions. New physics effects can be
reflected in deviations from the prediction. In this thesis the spin
correlation of $t\bar{t}$ pairs, produced at a centre-of-mass energy of
$\sqrt{s} = 7\,$TeV and reconstructed with the ATLAS detector, is measured. The
dataset corresponds to an integrated luminosity of $4.6~\text{fb}^{-1}$.
$t\bar{t}$ pairs are reconstructed in the $\ell$+jets channel using a kinematic
likelihood fit offering the identification of light up- and down-type quarks
from the $t \rightarrow bW \rightarrow bq\bar{q}'$ decay. The spin correlation
is measured via the distribution of the azimuthal angle $\Delta\phi$ between
two top quark spin analyzers in the laboratory frame. It is expressed as the
degree of $t\bar{t}$ spin correlation predicted by the Standard Model,
$f_{\text{SM}}$. The results of \begin{align*} &f_{\text{SM}}(

  Legendre duality","31 pages",,,,"math.DG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Supplementary comments about generalized Lie algebroids are presented and a
new point of view over the construction of the Lie algebroid generalized
tangent bundle of a (dual) vector bundle is introduced. Using the general
theory of exterior differential calculus for generalized Lie algebroids, a
covariant derivative for exterior forms of a (dual) vector bundle is
introduced. Using this covariant derivative, the complete lift of an arbitrary
section of a (dual) vector bundle is discovered. A theory of Legendre type and
Legendre duality between vertical and complete lifts is presented. Finally, a
duality between Lie algebroids structures is developed.
