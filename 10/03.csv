type which is shown to be the natural representation for general defaultable
OTC contract with contingent CSA. This is a theoretical counterparty risk
mitigation mechanism that allows the counterparty of a general OTC contract to
switch from zero to full/perfect collateralization and switch back whenever she
wants until contract maturity paying some switching costs and taking into
account the running costs that emerge over time. In this paper we allow for the
strategic interaction between the counterparties of the underlying contract,
which makes the problem solution much more tough. We are motivated in this
research by the importance to show the economic sense - in terms of optimal
contract design - of a contingent counterparty risk mitigation mechanism like
our one. In particular, we show that the existence of the solution and the game
Nash equilibrium is connected with the solution of a system of non-linear
reflected BSDE which remains an open problem. We then provide the basic ideas
to numerically search the game equilibrium via an iterative optimal stopping
approach and we show the existence of the solution for our problem under strong
condition, in the so called symmetric case.

phase the 3d electrons at the Fe site with Fe only nearest neighbors remain
rather strongly correlated even at extreme pressure-temperature conditions,
with the local and uniform magnetic susceptibility exhibiting a
Curie-Weiss-like temperature evolution and the quasi-particle lifetime {\Gamma}
featuring a non-Fermi-liquid temperature dependence. In contrast, for the
corresponding Fe site in the hcp phase we predict a weakly-correlated
Fermi-liquid state with a temperature-independent local susceptibility and a
quadratic temperature dependence of {\Gamma}. The iron sites with nickel atoms
in the local environment exhibit behavior in the range between those two
extreme cases, with the strength of correlations gradually increasing along the
hcp-fcc-bcc sequence. Further, the inter-site magnetic interactions in the bcc
and hcp phases are also strongly affected by the presence of Ni nearest
neighbors. The sensitivity to the local environment is related to modifications
of the Fe partial density of states due to mixing with Ni 3d-states.

widely linear state space and augmented complex statistics to deal with
unbalanced system conditions and the generality complex signals, both second
order circular (proper) and second order noncircular (improper). It is shown
that the current, strictly linear, estimators are inadequate for unbalanced
systems, a typical case in smart grids, as they do not account for either the
noncircularity of Clarke's \alpha \beta-voltage in unbalanced conditions or the
correlated nature of nodal disturbances. We illuminate the relationship between
the degree of circularity of Clarke's voltage and system imbalance, and prove
that the proposed widely linear estimators are optimal for such conditions,
while also accounting for the correlated and noncircular nature of real-world
nodal disturbances. {Synthetic and real world} case studies over a range of

the proposed methodology.

Radiation and matter are tightly coupled and their interplay influences the
physical and chemical properties of gas. In particular, modeling the radiation
propagation requires calculating column densities, which can be numerically
expensive in high-resolution multidimensional simulations. Aims. Developing
fast methods for estimating column densities is mandatory if we are interested
in the dynamical influence of the radiative transfer. In particular, we focus
on the effect of the UV screening on the dynamics and on the statistical
properties of molecular clouds. Methods. We have developed a tree-based method
for a fast estimate of column densities, implemented in the adaptive mesh
refinement code RAMSES. We performed numerical simulations using this method in
order to analyze the influence of the screening on the clump formation.
Results. We find that the accuracy for the extinction of the tree-based method
is better than 10%, while the relative error for the column density can be much
more. We describe the implementation of a method based on precalculating the
geometrical terms that noticeably reduces the calculation time. To study the
influence of the screening on the statistical properties of molecular clouds we
present the probability distribution function (PDF) of gas and the associated
temperature per density bin and the mass spectra for different density
thresholds. Conclusions. The tree-based method is fast and accurate enough to
be used during numerical simulations since no communication is needed between
CPUs when using a fully threaded tree. It is then suitable to parallel
computing. We show that the screening for far UV radiation mainly affects the
dense gas, thereby favoring low temperatures and affecting the fragmentation.

approach their vitreous state - increases of many orders of magnitude in

condensed matter. These changes are accompanied by greater dynamic
heterogeneity, which refers to both spatial variation and spatial correlation
of molecular mobilities. The question is whether the changing dynamics is
coupled to this heterogeneity; that is, does the latter cause the former? To
address this we carried out the first nonlinear dielectric experiments at
elevated hydrostatic pressures on two liquids, to measure the third-order
harmonic component of their susceptibilities. We extract from this the number
of dynamically correlated molecules for various state points, and find that the
dynamic correlation volume for non-associated liquids depends primarily on the
relaxation time, sensibly independent of temperature and pressure. We support
this result by molecular dynamic simulations showing that the maximum in the
four-point dynamic susceptibility of density fluctuations varies less than 10%
for molecules that do not form hydrogen bonds. Our findings are consistent with
dynamic heterogeneity serving as the principal control parameter for the
slowing down of molecular motions in supercooled materials.

activations $h=f(x)$, e.g., as in sparse autoencoders. Both encoder and decoder
can be represented by a deep neural network and trained to maximize the average

$X$ itself, estimated by $P(H)$. This ""flattens the manifold"" or concentrates
probability mass in a smaller number of (relevant) dimensions over which the
distribution factorizes. Generating samples from the model is straightforward
using ancestral sampling. One challenge is that regular back-propagation cannot
be used to obtain the gradient on the parameters of the encoder, but we find
that using the straight-through estimator works well here. We also find that
although optimizing a single level of such architecture may be difficult, much
better results can be obtained by pre-training and stacking them, gradually
transforming the data distribution into one that is more easily captured by a

exhibits some degree of inhomogeneity on sufficiently small scales and a high
degree of homogeneity on sufficiently large scales. This inhomogeneity appears
unrelated to the phenomenon of dynamical dimensional reduction. I also uncover

which is also used in subsequent direct numerical simulation of these flows.
For given Reynolds and Hartmann numbers, we obtain an upper bound for the
dimension of the attractor by means of known bounds on the nonlinear inertial
term and this functional basis for the flow. Three distinct flow regimes
emerge: a quasi-isotropic 3D flow, a non-isotropic three-dimensional (3D) flow,

parameterized by Hartmann number Ha and attractor dimension $d_\text{att}$. We
find how the attractor dimension scales as a function of Reynolds and Hartmann

boundary layer along the bounding wall, and find that in all regimes this
scales as 1/Re, independently of the value of Ha, unlike Hartmann boundary
layers found when the field is normal to the channel. The structure of the set

ring."" For a thin, circular drop with a constant evaporation rate, we find the
surface density of the stain goes as $\eta(r) \propto
\left(\left(r/a_0\right)^{-1/2}-r/a_0\right)$, where $r$ is the radius from the
drop center and $a_0$ is the initial outer radius. Under these conditions, the
deposited stain has a mountain-like morphology. Our framework can easily be
extended to investigate new stain morphologies left by drying drops.

(TWSs) in the context of text classification. In text mining a TWS determines
the way in which documents will be represented in a vector space model, before
applying a classifier. Whereas acceptable performance has been obtained with
standard TWSs (e.g., Boolean and term-frequency schemes), the definition of
TWSs has been traditionally an art. Further, it is still a difficult task to
determine what is the best TWS for a particular problem and it is not clear
yet, whether better schemes, than those currently available, can be generated
by combining known TWS. We propose in this article a genetic program that aims
at learning effective TWSs that can improve the performance of current schemes
in text classification. The genetic program learns how to combine a set of
basic units to give rise to discriminative TWSs. We report an extensive
experimental study comprising data sets from thematic and non-thematic text
classification as well as from image classification. Our study shows the
validity of the proposed method; in fact, we show that TWSs learned with the
genetic program outperform traditional schemes and other TWSs proposed in
recent works. Further, we show that TWSs learned from a specific domain can be
effectively used for other tasks.

is first considered to derive variable-coefficient generalizations of various

illustrative examples, we consider generalizations of the NLS and DNLS
equations, as well as a PT-symmetric version of the NLS equation. It is
demonstrated that the techniques yield Lax- or S-integrable NLPDEs with both
time- AND space-dependent coefficients which are thus more general than almost
all cases considered earlier via other methods such as the Painleve Test, Bell
Polynomials, and various similarity methods. However, this technique, although
operationally effective, has the significant disadvantage that, for any
integrable system with spatiotemporally varying coefficients, one must 'guess'
a generaliza- tion of the structure of the known Lax Pair for the corresponding
system with constant coefficients. Motivated by the somewhat arbitrary nature
of the above procedure, we therefore next attempt to systematize the derivation
of Lax-integrable sytems with variable coefficients. We attempt to apply the
Estabrook- Wahlquist (EW) prolongation technique, a relatively self-consistent
procedure requiring little prior infomation. However, this immediately requires
that the technique be significantly generalized or broadened in several
different ways. The new and extended EW technique which results is illustrated
by algorithmically deriving generalized Lax-integrable versions of NLS,
PT-symmetric NLS, and DNLS equations.

continuous-wave terahertz spectroscopy. Photomixing of three lasers allows us
to measure at three terahertz frequencies simultaneously. Similar to Fourier
spectroscopy, the spectral information is contained in an nterferogram, which
is equivalent to the waveform in time-domain spectroscopy. We use one fixed
terahertz frequency \nu_ref to monitor temporal drifts of the setup, i.e., of
the optical path-length difference. The other two frequencies are scanned for
broadband high-resolution spectroscopy. The frequency dependence of the phase
is obtained with high accuracy by normalizing it to the data obtained at
\nu_ref, which eliminates drifts of the optical path-length difference. We
achieve an accuracy of about 1-2 microns or 10^{-8} of the optical path length.
This method is particularly suitable for applications in nonideal environmental
conditions outside of an air-conditioned laboratory.

paper gives necessary and sufficient conditions for exponential mean square
stability, based on linear matrix inequalities. In both the linear and
nonlinear cases, the Lyapunov inequalities are constructed from a simple linear
combination of the classical inequalities from continuous and discrete time.
Crucially, the stability theorems only depend on the mean sampling intervals.
Thus, they can be applied with only limited statistical information about the

metabolite-dependent cotranscriptional folding and unfolding dynamics of
riboswitches is the key determinant of gene expression, it is important to
investigate both the thermodynamics and kinetics of riboswitches both in the
presence and absence of metabolite. Single molecule force experiments that
decipher the free energy landscape of riboswitches from their mechanical
responses, theoretical and computational studies have recently shed light on
the distinct mechanism of folding dynamics in different classes of
riboswitches. Here we first discuss the dynamics of water around riboswitch,
highlighting that water dynamics can enhance the fluctuation of nucleic acid
structure. To go beyond native state fluctuations we used the Self-Organized
Polymer (SOP) model to predict the dynamics of add adenine riboswitch under
mechanical forces. In addition to quantitatively predicting the folding
landscape of add-riboswitch our simulations also explain the difference in the
dynamics between pbuE adenine- and add adenine-riboswitches. In order to probe
the function {\it in vivo} we use the folding landscape to propose a system

also beneficial as it greatly reduces the generation of four-wave mixing inside

elaboration of innovative nanomaterials. Beyond their structures, many
important questions on the thermodynamics of association remain to be answered.
Here, we investigate the complexation between poly(diallyldimethylammonium
chloride) (PDADMAC) and poly(sodium acrylate) (PANa) chains using a combination
of three techniques: isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), static and dynamic
light scattering and electrophoresis. Upon addition of PDADMAC to PANa or
vice-versa, the results obtained by the different techniques agree well with
each other, and reveal a two-step process. The primary process is the formation
of highly charged polyelectrolyte complexes of sizes 100 nm. The secondary
process is the transition towards a coacervate phase made of rich and poor
polymer droplets. The binding isotherms measured are accounted for using a
phenomenological model that provides the thermodynamic parameters for each
reaction. Small positive enthalpies and large positive entropies consistent
with a counterion release scenario are found throughout this study. Beyond,
this work stresses the importance of the underestimated formulation pathway or
mixing order in polyelectrolyte complexation.

even 1 day is sufficient for such a survey. This catalog can then be provided

H$\alpha$ observations, which track the star formation rate and are therefore
correlated with the rate of compact binary mergers. H$\alpha$ surveys are also
able to filter out galaxies that are farther away than the maximum GW source

three dimensional radiation magneto-hydrodynamical simulation. We solve the
time dependent radiative transfer equation for the specific intensities to
accurately calculate the angular distribution of the emitted radiation.
Turbulence generated by the magneto-rotational instability provides
self-consistent angular momentum transfer. The simulation reaches inflow
equilibrium with an accretion rate ~220L_edd/c^2 and forms a radiation driven
outflow along the rotation axis. The mechanical energy flux carried by the
outflow is ~20% of the radiative energy flux. The total mass flux lost in the
outflow is about 29% of the net accretion rate. The radiative luminosity of
this flow is ~10L_edd. This yields a radiative efficiency ~4.5%, which is
comparable to the value in a standard thin disk model. In our simulation,
vertical advection of radiation caused by magnetic buoyancy transports energy
faster than photon diffusion, allowing a significant fraction of the photons to
escape from the surface of the disk before being advected into the black hole.
We contrast our results with the lower radiative efficiencies inferred in most
models, such as the slim disk model, which neglect vertical advection. Our
inferred radiative efficiencies also exceed published results from previous
global numerical simulations, which did not attribute a significant role to
vertical advection. We briefly discuss the implications for the growth of
supermassive black holes in the early universe and describe how these results
provided a basis for explaining the spectrum and population statistics of

is consistent with ejection of a large quantity of slow moving dust and icy
grains in the coma at large heliocentric distance. The dust morphology was
dominated by the tail, but a faint sunward dust fan was detected in March,
April, May, and September. We imaged multiple gas species in September,
October, and November. Excess CN signal was observed in the sunward hemisphere
in September and early October. In November the excess CN signal was in the
tailward hemisphere and two faint CN features appeared approximately orthogonal

night. Using numerical modeling, we best reproduced the orientation and shape
of these features as well as the bulk brightness with a pole oriented
approximately towards the Sun and a single source located within ~35 degrees of

publicly-available N-body MDPL halo catalog. In the conventional method, we use
a standard M(sigma_v) power law scaling relation to infer cluster mass, M, from
line-of-sight (LOS) galaxy velocity dispersion, sigma_v. The resulting
fractional mass error distribution is broad, with width=0.87 (68% scatter), and
has extended high-error tails. The standard scaling relation can be simply
enhanced by including higher-order moments of the LOS velocity distribution.
Applying the kurtosis as a correction term to log(sigma_v) reduces the width of
the error distribution to 0.74 (16% improvement). Machine learning can be used
to take full advantage of all the information in the velocity distribution. We
employ the Support Distribution Machines (SDMs) algorithm that learns from
distributions of data to predict single values. SDMs trained and tested on the
distribution of LOS velocities yield width=0.46 (47% improvement). Furthermore,
the problematic tails of the mass error distribution are effectively
eliminated. Decreasing cluster mass errors will improve measurements of the
growth of structure and lead to tighter constraints on cosmological parameters.

cluster galaxies with signatures of on-going ram-pressure stripping. H$_2$
emission is detected in all four; two show extraplanar H$_2$ emission. The
emission usually has a warm (T $\sim$ $115 - 160$K) and a hot (T $\sim$ 400 $-$
600K) component that is approximately two orders of magnitude less massive than
the warm one. The warm component column densities are typically $10^{19} -
10^{20}$ cm$^{-2}$ with masses of $10^6 - 10^8 M_\odot$. The warm H$_2$ is
anomalously bright compared with normal star-forming galaxies and therefore may
be excited by ram-pressure. In the case of CGCG 97-073, the H$_2$ is offset
from the majority of star formation along the direction of the galaxy's motion
in the cluster, suggesting it is forming in the ram-pressure wake of the
galaxy. Another galaxy, NGC 4522, exhibits a warm H$_2$ tail approximately 4
kpc in length. These results support the hypothesis that H$_2$ within these
galaxies is shock-heated from the interaction with the intracluster medium.
Stripping of dust is also a common feature of the galaxies. For NGC 4522, where
the distribution of dust at 8 $\mu$m is well resolved, knots and ripples
demonstrate the turbulent nature of the stripping process. The H$\alpha$ and 24
$\mu$m luminosities show that most of the galaxies have star formation rates
comparable to similar mass counterparts in the field. Finally, we suggest a
possible evolutionary sequence primarily related to the strength of
ram-pressure a galaxy experiences to explain the varied results observed in our

hindered by the secondary B-mode polarization anisotropy induced by
gravitational lensing. Fortunately, these contaminating B modes can be
estimated and removed with a sufficiently good estimate of the intervening
gravitational potential and a good map of CMB E-mode polarization. We present
forecasts for how well these gravitational lensing B modes can be removed,
assuming that the lensing potential can be estimated either internally from CMB

that CIB maps are as effective as CMB maps for delensing at the noise levels of
the current generation of CMB experiments, while the CMB maps themselves will
ultimately be best for delensing at polarization noise below $\Delta_P$=1
$\mu$K-arcmin. At this sensitivity level, CMB delensing will be able to measure
$n_T$ to an accuracy of 0.02 or better, which corresponds to the tensor tilt
predicted by the consistency relation for single-field slow-roll models of
inflation with $r=0.2$. However, CIB-based delensing will not be sufficient for
constraining $n_T$ in simple inflationary models.

sequence in NGC\,1261 which can be well reproduced individually by a
theoretical model prediction of a 2 Gyr old population of stellar collision

infer the degree to which dust obscuration affects the measurement of star
formation rates. While much recent work has focused on calibrating dust
attenuation in galaxies selected at rest-frame ultraviolet wavelengths, locally
and at high-$z$, here we investigate attenuation in dusty, star-forming
galaxies (DSFGs) selected at far-infrared wavelengths. By combining
multiwavelength coverage across 0.15--500\,$\mu$m in the COSMOS field, in
particular making use of {\it Herschel} imaging, and a rich dataset on local
galaxies, we find a empirical variation in the relationship between rest-frame
UV slope ($\beta$) and ratio of infrared-to-ultraviolet emission ($L_{\rm
IR}/L_{\rm UV}\equiv\,IRX$) as a function of infrared luminosity, or total star
formation rate, SFR. Both locally and at high-$z$, galaxies above
SFR$\gt$50\,M$_\odot$\,yr$^{-1}$ deviate from the nominal $IRX-\beta$ relation
towards bluer colors by a factor proportional to their increasing IR
luminosity. We also estimate contamination rates of DSFGs on high-$z$ dropout
searches of $\ll1$\%\ at $z\lt4-10$, providing independent verification that
contamination from very dusty foreground galaxies is low in LBG searches.
Overall, our results are consistent with the physical interpretation that
DSFGs, e.g. galaxies with $>50$\,M$_\odot$\,yr$^{-1}$, are dominated at all
epochs by short-lived, extreme burst events, producing many young O and B stars
that are primarily, yet not entirely, enshrouded in thick dust cocoons. The
blue rest-frame UV slopes of DSFGs are inconsistent with the suggestion that
most DSFGs at $z\sim2$ exhibit steady-state star formation in secular disks.

increasingly important and challenging with the popularity of smart devices and

information expression support, effective content matching and timely
information dissemination over the dynamic wireless network. A novel attribute
range vector structure has been introduced for efficient and accurate content
representation and a summary tree structure to facilitate information

the proposed overlay system exploits a virtual hierarchical geographic

significantly faster event matching speed, while incurs very low storage and

This work is motivated by recent experimental and theoretical activity in
spin-liquid-like systems with disorder and in the disordered interacting boson
problem. In particular, we apply our theory to both paramagnetic low-field and
fully polarized high-field phases in dimerized spin-$\frac12$ systems and in
integer-spin magnets with large single-ion easy-plane anisotropy $\cal D$ with
disorder in exchange coupling constants (and/or $\cal D$). The elementary
excitation spectrum and the density of states are calculated in the first order
in defects concentration $c\ll1$. In 2D and 3D systems, the scattering on
defects leads to a finite damping of all propagating excitations in the band
except for states lying near its edges. We demonstrate that the analytical
approach is inapplicable for states near the band edges and our numerical
calculations reveal their localized nature. We find that the damping of
propagating excitations can be much more pronounced in considered systems than
in magnetically ordered gapless magnets with impurities. In 1D systems, the
disorder leads to localization of all states in the band, while those lying far
from the band edges (short-wavelength excitations) can look like conventional
wavepackets.

Loss compounds with distance|exponentially in an optical fiber, and
inverse-square with distance for a free-space channel. In order to boost
classical communication rates over long distances, it is customary to introduce
regenerative relays at intermediate points along the channel. It is therefore
natural to speculate whether untended regenerative stations, such as
phase-insensitive or phase-sensitive optical amplifiers, could serve as
repeaters for long-distance QKD. The primary result of this paper rules out all
bosonic Gaussian channels to be useful as QKD repeaters, which include
phase-insensitive and phase-sensitive amplifiers as special cases, for any QKD
protocol. We also delineate the conditions under which a Gaussian relay renders
a lossy channel entanglement breaking, which in turn makes the channel useless

A magnetic transition to long range antiferromagnetic order, consistent with a

Fisher heat capacity and elastic neutron scattering, with an ordered moment of
1.65(6)~$\mu_B$ on Os$^{5+}$. The ordered moment is much reduced from either
the expected spin only value of $\sim 3 \mu_B$ or the value appropriate to
$4d^3$ Ru$^{5+}$ in isostructural Ba$_2$YRuO$_6$ of 2.2(1)~$\mu_B$, suggesting
a role for spin orbit coupling (SOC). Triple axis neutron scattering
measurements of the order parameter suggest an additional first-order

Time-of-flight inelastic neutron results reveal a large spin gap $\Delta \sim

not previously well-studied on the parsec scale. Observations were made between
August and December 2013, at a frequency of 8.4 GHz. These observations
represent the first epoch of a VLBA monitoring campaign on these blazars, and
they significantly increase the fraction of TeV HBLs studied with
high-resolution imaging. The peak VLBI flux densities of these sources range
from about 10 to 100 mJy/beam, and parsec-scale jet structure is detected in
all sources. About half of the VLBI cores are resolved, with brightness
temperature upper limits of a few times 10^10 K, and we find that a brightness
temperature of about 2x10^10 K is consistent with the VLBI data for all but one
of the sources. Such brightness temperatures do not require any relativistic
beaming to reduce the observed value below commonly invoked intrinsic limits;
however, the lack of detection of counter-jets does place a modest limit on the
bulk Lorentz factor of greater than about 2. These data are thus consistent
with a picture where weak-jet sources like the TeV HBLs develop significant
velocity structures on parsec-scales. We also extend consideration to the full
sample of TeV HBLs by combining the new VLBI data with VLBI and gamma-ray data
from the literature. By comparing measured VLBI and TeV fluxes to samples with
intrinsically uncorrelated luminosities generated by Monte Carlo simulations,
we find a marginally significant correlation between the VLBI and TeV fluxes

processes including the fabrication of photonic materials and scaffolds for
biological assemblies. The ionic strength of the electrolyte that suspends
charged colloids is widely used to control the physical properties of colloidal
suspensions. The extensively used two-body Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek
(DLVO) approach allows for a quantitative analysis of the effective
electrostatic forces between colloidal particles. DLVO relates the ionic
double-layers, which enclose the particles, to their effective electrostatic
repulsion. Nevertheless, the double layer is distorted at high macroion volume
fractions. Therefore, DLVO cannot describe the many-body effects that arise in
concentrated suspensions. We show that this problem can be largely resolved by
identifying effective point charges for the macroions using cell theory. This
extrapolated point charge (EPC) method assigns effective point charges in a
consistent way, taking into account the excluded volume of highly charged
macroions at any concentration, and thereby naturally accounting for high
volume fractions in both salt-free and added-salt conditions. We provide an
analytical expression for the effective pair potential and validate the EPC
method by comparing molecular dynamics simulations of macroions and monovalent
microions that interact via Coulombic potentials to simulations of macroions
interacting via the derived EPC effective potential. The simulations reproduce
the macroion-macroion spatial correlation and the virial pressure obtained with
the EPC model. Our findings provide a route to relate the physical properties
such as pressure in systems of screened-Coulomb particles to experimental
measurements.

characterized because it is infeasible to find a large and geographically

techniques that are able to measure connectivity between a remote client and an
arbitrary server, neither of which are under the control of the researcher
performing measurements. In addition to hybrid idle scans, we present and
employ a novel side channel in the Linux kernel's SYN backlog. We demonstrate
both techniques by measuring the reachability of the Tor network which is known
to be blocked in China. Our measurements reveal that 1) failures in the

geographical patterns, 2) a network block in China appears to have unfiltered
access to parts of the Tor network, and 3) the filtering seems to be mostly

The interfacial thermal conductance across the grain boundaries is found larger

largely because of the electron's specific heat. A unified interfacial thermal

state (notably through piecewise polytropic equations of state). Using these
quasiequilibrium sequences we compute the binary's scalar charge and binding
energy versus orbital angular frequency. We find that the absolute value of the
binding energy is smaller than in general relativity (GR), differing at most by
~14% at high frequencies for the cases considered. We use the newly computed
binding energy and the balance equation to estimate the number of
gravitational-wave (GW) cycles during the adiabatic, quasicircular inspiral
stage up to the end of the sequence, which is the last stable orbit or the
mass-shedding point, depending on which comes first. We find that, depending on
the ST parameters, the number of GW cycles can be substantially smaller than in
GR. In particular, we obtain that when dynamical scalarization sets in around a
GW frequency of ~130 Hz, the sole inclusion of the ST binding energy causes a
reduction of GW cycles from ~120 Hz up to the end of the sequence (~1200 Hz) of
~11% with respect to the GR case. We estimate that when the ST energy flux is
also included the reduction in GW cycles becomes of ~24%. Quite interestingly,
dynamical scalarization can produce a difference in the number of GW cycles
with respect to the GR point-particle case that is much larger than the effect
due to tidal interactions, which is on the order of only a few GW cycles. These
results further clarify and confirm recent studies that have evolved BNSs
either in full numerical relativity or in post-Newtonian theory, and point out
the importance of developing accurate ST-theory waveforms for systems composed
of strongly self-gravitating objects, such as BNSs.

human body measurement and modeling. Estimation of 3D body shape is
particularly useful for fashion e-commerce applications such as virtual try-on
or fit personalization. In this paper, we propose a method for capturing
accurate human body shape and anthropometrics from a single consumer grade
depth sensor. We first generate a large dataset of synthetic 3D human body
models using real-world body size distributions. Next, we estimate key body
measurements from a single monocular depth image. We combine body measurement
estimates with local geometry features around key joint positions to form a
robust multi-dimensional feature vector. This allows us to conduct a fast
nearest-neighbor search to every sample in the dataset and return the closest
one. Compared to existing methods, our approach is able to predict accurate
full body parameters from a partial view using measurement parameters learned
from the synthetic dataset. Furthermore, our system is capable of generating 3D
human mesh models in real-time, which is significantly faster than methods
which attempt to model shape and pose deformations. To validate the efficiency
and applicability of our system, we collected a dataset that contains frontal
and back scans of 83 clothed people with ground truth height and weight.
Experiments on real-world dataset show that the proposed method can achieve
real-time performance with competing results achieving an average error of 1.9
cm in estimated measurements.

both hotter T-type brown dwarfs and the hotter planets that can be imaged
orbiting young nearby stars (both with effective temperatures of in the range
1500-1000K). Distance measurements for these objects deliver absolute
magnitudes that make critical tests of our understanding of very cool
atmospheres. Here we report new distances for nine Y dwarfs and seven very-late
T dwarfs. These reveal that Y dwarfs do indeed represent a continuation of the
T dwarf sequence to both fainter luminosities and cooler temperatures. They
also show that the coolest objects display a large range in absolute magnitude
for a given photometric colour. The latest atmospheric models show good
agreement with the majority of these Y dwarf absolute magnitudes. This is also
the case for WISE0855-0714 the coldest and closest brown dwarf to the Sun,

outstanding exceptions, which suggest either binarity or the presence of
condensate clouds. The former is readily testable with current adaptive optics
facilities. The latter would mean that the range of cloudiness in Y dwarfs is
substantial with most hosting almost no clouds -- while others have dense
clouds making them prime targets for future variability observations to study
cloud dynamics.

cardinality of the smallest subset of $M$ that is contained in no other perfect
matchings of $G$. For a planar embedding of a 2-connected bipartite planar
graph $G$ which has a perfect matching, the concept of Clar number of hexagonal
system had been extended by Abeledo and Atkinson as follows: a spanning
subgraph $C$ of is called a Clar cover of $G$ if each of its components is
either an even face or an edge, the maximum number of even faces in Clar covers
of $G$ is called Clar number of $G$, and the Clar cover with the maximum number
of even faces is called the maximum Clar cover. It was proved that if $G$ is a
hexagonal system with a perfect matching $M$ and $K'$ is a set of hexagons in a
maximum Clar cover of $G$, then $G-K'$ has a unique 1-factor. Using this
result, Xu {\it et. at.} proved that the maximum forcing number of the
elementary hexagonal system are equal to their Clar numbers, and then the
maximum forcing number of the elementary hexagonal system can be computed in
polynomial time. In this paper, we show that an elementary polyomino has a
unique perfect matching when removing the set of tetragons from its maximum
Clar cover. Thus the maximum forcing number of elementary polyomino equals to
its Clar number and can be computed in polynomial time. Also, we have extended

gamma-ray spectrum of 1H 0323+342 and PMN J0948+0022 shows deviation from a

better fit. The spectra of 1H 0323+342, SBS 0846+513, and PMN J0948+0022,
respectively in low, flaring, and moderately active states, show significant
curvature. Such curvature in the gamma-ray spectrum of 1H 0323+342 and PMN
J0948+0022 can be due to emission region located inside the broad line region
(BLR) where the primary mechanism of the gamma-ray emission is inverse-Compton
(IC) scattering of BLR photons occurring in the Klein-Nishina regime. The
gamma-ray emission of SBS 0846+513 is explained by IC scattering of dusty torus
photons which puts the emission region to be outside the BLR and thus under the
Thomson regime. Therefore, the observed curvature of SBS 0846+513 could be
intrinsic to the particle energy distribution. The presence of curvature in the
gamma-ray spectrum and flux variability amplitudes of some of the RL-NLSy1
galaxies suggest that these sources could be akin to low/moderate jet power
flat spectrum radio quasars.

triple-therapy.
  METHODS: We searched PubMed, the Cochrane Library and Web of Knowledge for
studies regarding the interleukin 28B (IL-28B)-genotype and protease-inhibitor
based triple-therapy. Ten studies with 2707 patients were included into this
meta-analysis. We used regression methods in order to investigate determinants

  RESULTS: IL-28B-CC-genotype patients achieved higher SVR rates (odds 5.34,
CI: 3.81-7.49) than IL-28B-non-CC-genotype patients (1.88, CI: 1.43-2.48)

on three-dimensional mesh grids which is efficient on processors with highly
parallel architecture such as recently popular GPUs and CPUs with multi- and
many-core architectures. The scheme is based on the ray-tracing method and the
computational cost is proportional to $N_{\rm m}^{5/3}$ where $N_{\rm m}$ is
the number of mesh grids, and is devised to compute the radiation transfer
along each light-ray completely in parallel with appropriate grouping of the
light-rays. We find that the performance of our scheme scales well with the
number of adopted CPU cores and GPUs, and also that our scheme is nicely
parallelized on a multi-node system by adopting the multiple wave front scheme,
and the performance scales well with the amount of the computational resources.
As numerical tests to validate our scheme and to give a physical criterion for
the angular resolution of our ray-tracing scheme, we perform several numerical
simulations of the photo-ionization of neutral hydrogen gas by ionizing
radiation sources without the ""on-the-spot"" approximation, in which the
transfer of diffuse radiation by radiative recombination is incorporated in a

which generates a strong electric field at the electrode-electrolyte interface.
Unlike conventional metallic electrodes, graphene-derived materials suffer from
a low electronic density of states (i.e., quantum capacitance), which limits
their ability to redistribute charge and efficiently screen this field. To
explore these effects, we introduce a first-principles approach based on the
effective screening medium framework, which is used to directly simulate the
charge storage behavior of single- and multi-layered graphene in a way that
more closely approximates operating devices. We demonstrate that the presence
of the interfacial field significantly alters the capacitance in electrodes
thinner than a few graphene layers, deriving in large part from intrinsic
space-charge screening limitations. The capacitance is also found to be highly
sensitive to the gap between the electrode and the solvent (contact layer),
which offers possibilities for tuning the interfacial capacitance of the
electrode by proper engineering of the electrolyte. Our results offer an
alternative interpretation of discrepancies between experimental measurements
and fixed-band models, and provide specific implications for improving

to develop computationally time-efficient but still accurate numerical methods.
This article develops a general variational formalism for any ${\bf E}({\bf

thousands of turns, taking magnetization currents fully into account. The
variational principle, valid for any 3D situation, restricts the computations
to the sample volume, reducing the computation time. However, no additional
magnetic materials interacting with the superconductor are taken directly into
account. Regarding the coil modelling, we use a power law $E(J)$ relation with
magnetic field-dependent critical current density, $J_c$, and power law
exponent, $n$. We test the numerical model by comparing the results to
analytical formulas for thin strips and experiments for stacks of pancake
coils, finding a very good agreement. Afterwards, we model a magnet-size coil
of 4000 turns (stack of 20 pancake coils of 200 turns each). We found that the
AC loss is mainly due to magnetization currents. We also found that for an $n$
exponent of 20, the magnetization currents are greatly suppressed after 1 hour
relaxation. In addition, in coated conductor coils magnetization currents have
an important impact on the generated magnetic field; which should be taken into
account for magnet design. In conclusion, the presented numerical method
fulfills the requirements for electromagnetic design of coated conductor

use in applicative settings, such as machine learning, social networks, and
economics. Though fast algorithms were known for some special cases, only
recently Badanidiyuru and Vondr\'{a}k (2014) were the first to explicitly look
for such algorithms in the general case of maximizing a monotone submodular
function subject to a matroid independence constraint. The algorithm of
Badanidiyuru and Vondr\'{a}k matches the best possible approximation guarantee,
while trying to reduce the number of value oracle queries the algorithm
performs.
  Our main result is a new algorithm for this general case which establishes a
surprising tradeoff between two seemingly unrelated quantities: the number of
value oracle queries and the number of matroid independence queries performed
by the algorithm. Specifically, one can decrease the former by increasing the
latter and vice versa, while maintaining the best possible approximation
guarantee. Such a tradeoff is very useful since various applications might
incur significantly different costs in querying the value and matroid
independence oracles. Furthermore, in case the rank of the matroid is $O(n^c)$,
where $n$ is the size of the ground set and $c$ is an absolute constant smaller
than $1$, the total number of oracle queries our algorithm uses can be made to
have a smaller magnitude compared to that needed by Badanidiyuru and
Vondr\'{a}k. We also provide even faster algorithms for the well studied
special cases of a cardinality constraint and a partition matroid independence
constraint, both of which capture many real-world applications and have been
widely studied both theorically and in practice.

with a gas of free massless fermions.
  We present analytic derivation of the canonical partition functions and
Lee-Yang zeros for this type of free energy using the saddle point
approximation. We also perform lattice QCD simulation in a canonical approach
using the fugacity expansion of the fermion determinant, and carefully examine
its reliability. By comparing the analytic and numerical results, we conclude
that the canonical partition functions follow the Gaussian distribution of the
baryon number, and the accumulation of Lee-Yang zeros of these canonical
partition functions exhibit the first-order Roberge-Weiss phase transition. We
discuss the validity and applicable range of the result and its implications
both for theoretical and experimental studies.

very late thermal pulse a few years before its discovery in 1996. It ejected a
new, hydrogen-deficient nebula in the process. Emission lines from the newly
ejected gas were first discovered in 1998 (He I 1083 nm) and 2001 (optical). We
have monitored the optical emission spectrum since. From 2001 through 2007 the
optical spectrum showed an exponential decline in flux, consistent with a shock
that occurred around 1998 and started cooling soon after that. In this paper we
show that since 2008 the line fluxes have been continuously rising again. Our
preliminary interpretation is that this emission comes from a region close to
the central star, and is excited by a second shock. This shock may have been
induced by an increase in the stellar mass loss and wind velocity associated
with a rise in the stellar temperature.

hardness for ionizing radiation and non-uniform charge collection by edge

radiation-damage parameters implemented. Results show that if no conventional
guard ring is present, none of the current designs are able to achieve a high
breakdown voltage (typically < 30 V) after irradiation to a dose of ~10 MGy. In
addition, a charge-collection model has been developed and was used to
calculate the charges collected by the edge pixels of edgeless sensors when
illuminated with X-rays. The model takes into account the electric field
distribution inside the pixel sensor, the absorption of X-rays, drift and
diffusion of electrons and holes, charge sharing effect, and threshold settings
in ASICs. It is found that the non-uniform charge collection of edge pixels is
caused by the strong bending of electric field and the non-uniformity depends
on bias voltage, sensor thickness and distance from active edge to the last
pixel (""edge space""). In particular, the last few pixels close to the active
edge of the sensor are not sensitive to low-energy X-rays (< 10 keV) especially

subalgebra given by the irrational rotation algebra corresponding to
$\alpha_{2j}=(\theta+1)/p^{2j}$ is strongly Morita equivalent to the irrational
rotation algebra corresponding to the irrational rotation algebra corresponding
to $\beta_{2j}= 1-\frac{\theta+1}{p^{2j}\theta}$ by a different construction of
Rieffel, secondly, that that Rieffel's Heisenberg module relating the two non
commutative solenoids can be constructed as the closure of a nested sequence of
function spaces associated to a multiresolution analysis for a $p$-adic
wavelet, and finally, at each stage, the equivalence bimodule between
$A_{\alpha_{2j}}$ and $A_{\beta_{2j}}$ can be identified with the
subequivalence bimodules arising from the $p$-adic MRA. Aside from its
instrinsic interest, we believe this construction will guide us in our efforts
to show that certain necessary conditions for two noncommutative solenoids to
be strongly Morita equivalent are also sufficient.

trees. With the development of so-called tree constraints the plausibility of
the tree model assumptions can be addressed by checking whether the moments of
observed variables lie within regions consistent with trees. In our linguistic
application, the data set comprises acoustic samples (audio recordings) from
speakers of five Romance languages or dialects. We wish to assess these
functional data for compatibility with a hereditary tree model at the language
level. A novel combination of canonical function analysis (CFA) with a
separable covariance structure provides a method for generating a
representative basis for the data. This resulting basis is formed of components
which emphasize language differences whilst maintaining the integrity of the
observational language-groupings. A previously unexploited Gaussian tree
constraint is then applied to component-by-component projections of the data to
investigate adherence to an evolutionary tree. The results indicate that while
a tree model is unlikely to be suitable for modeling all aspects of the
acoustic linguistic data, certain features of the spoken Romance languages
highlighted by the separable-CFA basis may indeed be suitably modeled as a
tree.

field in the bulk. Starting from a Randall-Sundrum type of warped extra
dimension, and including the inevitable back reaction ensuing from the radius

electroencephalogram (EEG) signals of brain activities, and then send a command
or an intent to an external interactive device, such as a wheelchair. The
effectiveness of the BCI depends on the performance in decoding the EEG.
Usually, the EEG is contaminated by different kinds of artefacts (e.g.,
electromyogram (EMG), background activity), which leads to a low decoding
performance. A number of filtering methods can be utilized to remove or weaken
the effects of artefacts, but they generally fail when the EEG contains extreme
artefacts. In such cases, the most common approach is to discard the whole data
segment containing extreme artefacts. This causes the fatal drawback that the
BCI cannot output decoding results during that time. In order to solve this
problem, we employ the Lomb-Scargle periodogram to estimate the spectral power

Denoising Autoencoder (DAE) for learning. The proposed method is evaluated with

stationary solution for the electron distribution function that takes the form
of a kappa distribution. We show that the evolution toward this kappa

that electrons of higher energy are accelerated later; the acceleration time
scales with energy according to $\tau_{\rm acc} \sim E^{3/2}$. At sufficiently
high energies escape from the finite-length acceleration region will eventually
dominate. For such energies, the electron velocity distribution function is
obtained by solving a time-dependent Fokker-Planck equation in the ""leaky-box""
approximation. Solutions are obtained in the limit of a small escape rate from
an acceleration region that can effectively be considered a thick target.

  Recently (Tomashevskii 2015: Eur J Oper Res 240:774-780), the actual
numerical errors were found for EM, and it was shown that all EM rank reversal
phenomena have the same cause and are eliminated when the errors are taken into
account. In this paper the similar ap-proach is used for GMM: we associate GMM
with some standard measuring procedure, ana-lyze this procedure from the
viewpoint of measurement theory, and find the actual GMM errors. We show that
the GMM and the GMM-EM rank reversal phenomena are eliminated when the GMM and
the EM errors are taken into account.
  The GMM decision support tool, which has all components of a standard
measuring tool, is composed of pairwise comparisons as an initial measuring
procedure, GMM as a data processor, and the obtained formulas for GMM errors as
an error indicator. This tool is analogous to the EM decision support tool
received earlier in the above paper. It is shown that the EM and the GMM
versions of the tool are equally suitable to measure and rank any comparable
elements with positive numerical values.
  We also analyze the Geometric Consistency Index usually used in the original
GMM to measure of the inconsistency and to accept or reject an inconsistent
pairwise comparison matrix, and show that this index is not an acceptable GMM
error indicator.

make use of a forward-backward predictor based on autoregressive moving average
modelling (ARMA) in the time domain. The method MIARMA is particularly suitable
for replacing invalid data such as those present in the light curves of the
CoRoT satellite due to the pass through the South Atlantic Anomaly, and
eventually for the data gathered by the NASA planet hunter Kepler. We select a
sample of stars from the ultra-precise photometry collected by the
asteroseismic camera on board the CoRoT satellite: the {\delta} Scuti star HD
174966, showing periodic variations of the same order as the CoRoT
observational window, the Be star HD 51193, showing longer time variations, and
the solar-like HD 49933, with rapid time variations. We showed that in some
cases linear interpolations are less reliable to what was believed. In
particular: the power spectrum of HD 174966 is clearly aliased when this
interpolation is used for filling the gaps; the light curve of HD 51193
presents a much more aliased spectrum than expected for a low frequency
harmonic signal; and finally, although the linear interpolation does not affect
noticeably the power spectrum of the CoRoT light curve of the solar-like star
HD 49933, the ARMA interpolation showed rapid variations previously
unidentified that ARMA interprets as a signal. In any case, the ARMA
interpolation method provides a cleaner power spectrum, that is, less
contaminated by spurious frequencies. In conclusion, MIARMA appears to be a
suitable method for filling gaps in the light curves of pulsating stars
observed by CoRoT since the method preserves their frequency content, which is
a necessary condition for asteroseismic studies.

synthetic stellar spectrum, a synthetic telluric transmission, and empirical
DIB profiles. In parallel, stellar distances and extinctions are estimated
self-consistently by means of a 2D Bayesian method, from
spectroscopically-derived stellar parameters and photometric data. We have
analyzed Gaia-ESO Survey (GES) and previously recorded spectra that probe
between $\sim$ 2 and 10 kpc long LOS in five different regions of the Milky
Way. Depending on the observed spectral intervals, we extracted one or more of
the following DIBs: $\lambda\lambda$ 6283.8, 6613.6 and 8620.4. For each field,
we compared the DIB strengths with the Bayesian distances and extinctions, and
the DIB Doppler velocities with the HI emission spectra. For all fields, the
DIB strength and the target extinction are well correlated. In case of targets
widely distributed in distance, marked steps in DIBs and extinction radial
distance profiles match with each other and broadly correspond to the expected
locations of spiral arms. For all fields, the DIB velocity structure agrees
with HI emission spectra and all detected DIBs correspond to strong NaI lines.

benefit significantly from the improved brightness and photostability of the
popular organic dyes such as cyanines. Here, using a model cyanine dye, Cy3, we
demonstrate that brightness and photostability of the dye is significantly
altered when trapped in a molecular container, e.g. cucurbit[n]urils (CB[n])
and cyclodextrins (CD).Through computational modeling, we predicted that Cy3
forms a stable inclusion complex with three different hosts, CB[7], beta-CD,
and methyl-beta-CD, which was further confirmed by single-molecule diffusion
measurements using fluorescence correlation spectroscopy. The effect of
supramolecular encapsulation on Cy3 photophysical properties was found to be
highly host-specific. Up to three-fold increase in brightness of Cy3 was
observed when the dye was trapped in methyl-beta-CD, due to an increase in both
dye absorption and quantum yield. Steady-state and time-resolved spectroscopy
of the various complexes revealed that host polarizability and restricted
mobility of the dye in the host both contribute to the observed increase in
molecular brightness. Furthermore, entrapment of the dye molecule in CDs
resulted in a marked increase in dye photostability, whereas the dye degraded
more rapidly in CB[7]. These results suggest that the changes in photophysical
properties of the dye afforded by supramolecular encapsulation are highly
dependent on the host molecule. The reported improvement in brightness and
photostability together with the excellent biocompatibility of cyclodextrins
makes supramolecular encapsulation a viable strategy for routine dye
enhancement.

abundance ratio of Sr and Ba, is always higher than [Sr/Ba] = -0.5, the value
of the solar r-only process; however, a handful of EMP stars have recently been
found with a very low Sr/Ba ratio. We try to understand the origin of this
anomaly by comparing the abundance pattern of the elements in these stars and
in the classical EMP stars. Four stars with very low Sr/Ba ratios were observed
and analyzed within LTE approximation through 1D (hydrostatic) model
atmosphere, providing homogeneous abundances of nine neutron-capture elements.
In CS 22950-173, the only turnoff star of the sample, the Sr/Ba ratio is, in
fact, found to be higher than the r-only solar ratio, so the star is discarded.
The remaining stars (CS 29493-090, CS 30322-023, HE 305-4520) are cool evolved
giants. They do not present a clear carbon enrichment. The abundance patterns
of the neutron-capture elements in the three stars are strikingly similar to a
theoretical s-process pattern. This pattern could at first be attributed to
pollution by a nearby AGB, but none of the stars presents a clear variation in
the radial velocity indicating the presence of a companion. The stellar
parameters seem to exclude any internal pollution in a TP-AGB phase for at
least two of these stars. The possibility that the stars are early-AGB stars
polluted during the core He flash does not seem compatible with the theory.

  * admits a polynomial Turing kernel (that is, has an adaptive polynomial-time

satisfies the property that it is possible to delete a bounded number of
vertices such that every remaining component has size at most two, then
F-Subgraph Test is solvable in randomized polynomial time and it is NP-hard

distribution within the intervening lens. In this paper, we assemble a catalog
of 69 such systems, and carry out a one-on-one comparison between the standard
model, LCDM, and the R_h=ct Universe. We find that both models account for the
lens observations quite well, though the precision of these measurements does
not appear to be good enough to favor one model over the other. Part of the
reason is the so-called bulge-halo conspiracy that, on average, results in a
baryonic velocity dispersion within a fraction of the optical effective radius
virtually identical to that expected for the whole luminous-dark matter
distribution. Given the limitations of doing precision cosmological testing
using the current sample, we also carry out Monte Carlo simulations based on
the current lens measurements to estimate how large the source catalog would
have to be in order to rule out either model at a ~99.7% confidence level. We
find that if the real cosmology is LCDM, a sample of ~200 strong gravitational
lenses would be sufficient to rule out R_h=ct at this level of accuracy, while
~300 strong gravitational lenses would be required to rule out LCDM if the real
Universe were instead R_h=ct. The difference in required sample size reflects
the greater number of free parameters available to fit the data with LCDM. We
point out that, should the R_h=ct Universe eventually emerge as the correct
cosmology, its lack of any free parameters for this kind of work will provide a
remarkably powerful probe of the mass structure in lensing galaxies, and a
means of better understanding the origin of the bulge-halo conspiracy.

vehicles is an intensive research area in most major industrial countries.
Positive socio-economic potential impacts include a decrease of crashes, a
reduction of travel times, energy efficiency improvements, and a reduced need
of costly physical infrastructure. Some form of vehicle-to-vehicle and/or
vehicle-to-infrastructure cooperation is required to ensure a safe and
efficient global transportation system. This thesis deals with a particular
form of cooperation by studying the problem of coordinating multiple mobile
robots at an intersection area. Most of coordination systems proposed in
previous work consist in planning a trajectory and to control the robots along
the planned trajectory: that is the plan-as-program paradigm where planning is
considered as a generative mechanism of action. The approach of the thesis is
to plan priorities -- the relative order of robots to go through the
intersection -- which is much weaker as many trajectories respect the same
priorities. More precisely, priorities encode the homotopy classes of solutions
to the coordination problem. Priority assignment is equivalent to the choice of
some homotopy class to solve the coordination problem instead of a particular
trajectory. Once priorities are assigned, robots are controlled through a
control law preserving the assigned priorities, i.e., ensuring the described
trajectory belongs to the chosen homotopy class. It results in a more robust
coordination system -- able to handle a large class of unexpected events in a
reactive manner -- particularly well adapted for an application to the
coordination of autonomous vehicles at intersections where cars, public
transport and pedestrians share the road.

framework that describes model-based reasoning in upper-division physics labs.
Constructing and using models are core scientific practices that have gained
significant attention within K-12 and higher education. Although modeling is a
broadly applicable process, within physics education, it has been
preferentially applied to the iterative development of broadly applicable
principles (e.g., Newton's laws of motion in introductory mechanics). A
significant feature of the new framework is that measurement tools (in addition
to the physical system being studied) are subjected to the process of modeling.
Think-aloud interviews were used to refine the framework and demonstrate its
utility by documenting examples of model-based reasoning in the laboratory.
When applied to the think-aloud interviews, the framework captures and
differentiates students' model-based reasoning and helps identify areas of
future research. The interviews showed how students productively applied
similar facets of modeling to the physical system and measurement tools:
construction, prediction, interpretation of data, identification of model
limitations, and revision. Finally, we document students' challenges in
explicitly articulating assumptions when constructing models of experimental
systems and further challenges in model construction due to students'
insufficient prior conceptual understanding. A modeling perspective reframes
many of the seemingly arbitrary technical details of measurement tools and
apparatus as an opportunity for authentic and engaging scientific sense-making.

fraction is generally between 1% and 2%, with a 4% peak at 43 GHz in March; the
polarization angle is variable, mainly at 15 GHz, where it changes frequently,
and less so at 43 GHz, where it oscillates in the range 114 - 173 deg. The jet
polarization properties are more stable, with a fractional polarization of
around 16% and a polarization angle nearly perpendicular to the jet axis. The
average flux and photon index at gamma-ray energies are (17.7+-0.5)x10^8 ph
cm^-2 s^-1 and the photon index is 1.77+-0.02. The gamma-ray light curve shows
variability, with a main peak that appears to be associated with the peak in
the core polarized emission at 43 GHz, as well as with the total intensity
light curve. A discrete correlation function analysis yields a correlation
coefficient of 0.54 at zero delay, with a significance level above 99.7%. We
accurately determine the polarization properties of Mrk 421, both in the core
and in the jet region. The radio and gamma-ray light curves are correlated. The
observed EVPA variability at 15 GHz is partly due to opacity and partly to a
variable Faraday rotation effect. To explain the residual variability of the
intrinsic polarization angle and the low degree of polarization in the core
region, we invoke a blend of variable cross-polarized subcomponents with
different polarization properties within the beam.

partially reversed at glitches. This reversal comprises a step and an
asymptotic exponential with a 320-day time constant, as determined in the three
best-isolated glitches. The cumulative effect of all glitches is to reduce the
decrease in slowdown rate by about 6\%. Overall, a low mean braking index of
$2.342(1)$ is measured for the whole period, compared with values close to
$2.5$ in intervals between glitches. Removing the effects of individual
glitches reveals an underlying power law slowdown with the same braking index
of 2.5. We interpret this value in terms of a braking torque due to a dipolar
magnetic field in which the inclination angle between the dipole and rotation
axes is increasing. There may also be further effects due to a monopolar
particle wind or infalling supernova debris.

representative volume element consists in piezoelectric polymeric nanofibers,
assumed to feature a linear piezoelastic constitutive behavior and subjected to
electromechanical contact constraints using the penalty method. To avoid the

a contact smoothing approach based on B\'ezier patches is extended to the
multiphysics framework providing an improved continuity of the

equations are included through suitable electric, mechanical and coupling
potentials. From the solution of the micro-scale boundary value problem, a
suitable scale transition procedure leads to the formulation of a macroscopic

which is consistent with observational data and naturally explains the origin
of inflation and dark energy. We show that the de Sitter accelerated expansion
of the FLRW space with no matter fields (hereinafter, empty space) is its
natural state, and the model does not require either a scalar field or
cosmological constant or any other hypotheses. This is due to the fact that the
de Sitter state is an exact solution of the rigorous mathematically consistent
equations of one-loop quantum gravity for the empty FLRW space that are finite
off the mass shell. Space without matter fields is not empty, as it always has
the natural quantum fluctuations of the metric, i.e. gravitons. Therefore, the
empty (in this sense) space is filled with gravitons, which have the
backreaction effect on its evolution over time forming a self-consistent de
Sitter instanton leading to the exponentially accelerated expansion of the
Universe. At the start and the end of cosmological evolution, the Universe is
assumed to be empty, which explains the origin of inflation and dark energy.
This scenario leads to the prediction that the signs of the parameter 1+w
should be opposite in both cases, and this fact is consistent with
observations. The fluctuations of the number of gravitons lead to fluctuations
of their energy density which in turn leads to the observed CMB temperature
anisotropy of the order of 10^-5 and CMB polarization. In the frame of this
scenario, it is not a hypothetical scalar field that generates inflation and
relic gravitational waves but on the contrary, the gravitational waves
(gravitons) generate dark energy, inflation, CMB anisotropy and polarization.

the processes that govern energy relaxation of photoexcited carriers is
essential. The ultrafast energy relaxation in graphene occurs through two
competing pathways: carrier-carrier scattering -- creating an elevated carrier
temperature -- and optical phonon emission. At present, it is not clear what
determines the dominating relaxation pathway. Here we reach a unifying picture
of the ultrafast energy relaxation by investigating the terahertz
photoconductivity, while varying the Fermi energy, photon energy, and fluence
over a wide range. We find that sufficiently low fluence ($\lesssim$ 4
$\mu$J/cm$^2$) in conjunction with sufficiently high Fermi energy ($\gtrsim$
0.1 eV) gives rise to energy relaxation that is dominated by carrier-carrier
scattering, which leads to efficient carrier heating. Upon increasing the
fluence or decreasing the Fermi energy, the carrier heating efficiency
decreases, presumably due to energy relaxation that becomes increasingly
dominated by phonon emission. Carrier heating through carrier-carrier
scattering accounts for the negative photoconductivity for doped graphene
observed at terahertz frequencies. We present a simple model that reproduces
the data for a wide range of Fermi levels and excitation energies, and allows
us to qualitatively assess how the branching ratio between the two distinct
relaxation pathways depends on excitation fluence and Fermi energy.

its ability to explore the latent part-based structure of data. Recent study
shows that lots of data distributions have manifold structures, and we should
respect the manifold structure when the data are represented. Recently,
manifold regularized NMF used a nearest neighbor graph to regulate the learning

traditional NMF methods for data representation problems. However, how to
construct an optimal graph to present the manifold prop- erly remains a
difficultproblem due to the graph modelselection, noisy features, and nonlinear

Multiple graph learning is proposed to solve the problem of graph model
